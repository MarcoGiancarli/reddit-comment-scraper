I'm glad to say its been a whole week without a call, and the company assured me that they disabled the number for violating their rules.  First, perhaps Pac-West meant that the company was ""Peerless"" and not ""Peer List"" in which case it is   http://www.peerlessnetwork.com/contact-us/do-not-call-lists/  A quick look up of the number put it under both Pac-Wes and the following:    Peerless Network of Illinois, LLC - IL Woodland CA   Next, look up your states harassment statues.  For example, NY's harassment laws, specifically Harassment in the Second Degree (Penal Statue 240.26) specifically section 3    He or she engages in a course of conduct or repeatedly commits acts which alarm or seriously annoy such other person and which serve no legitimate purpose.    Now, write an email first at the above link, but perhaps to anyone involved with these calls.  Pac-Wes probably sold the number, so they won't be able to help.    Write in the email that their client [specific number] is violating your states harassment laws (chances say they are) as well as federal communication laws as your phone number is on the Nation Do Not Call Registry.  Also mention that no one at either company has any permission to contact you for any reason now, perviously, or in the future.  Any further contact from this company will be considered harassment.   ALSO say that if they are under the mistaken understanding that they have permission to contact you, that you revoke any and all permission to contact you granted previously, and that you revoke all future permission they may believe to which they are entitled.  Hold on this box is really small and I'm kinda drunk so I wanna edit in bigger format....  [edit 2] here is the original email I sent:   Hello Pinger and Bandwidth  I am received harassing robo-generated calls from your number.  This is a written message to both you, and your provider, to cease and desist with all forms of communication with me, or any number or email attached to my name, accounts, or information, excluding this email account up until these issues are resolved.  In case you are under the false pretense that I have given you permission, or a subsidiary or parent company permission, to contact me— I revoke any and all permissions from any and all parties or person involved with your companies.  Do not call me again.  I am a New York State resident, and your calls are in violation of our states laws on harassment; specifically N.Y. Penal Law Section 240.26 - Harassment in the Second Degree.  You calls also violate the FCC's Do Not Call Registry, of which I am part.  Failure to comply within a reasonable time frame will result in immediate legal action filed by myself against all pertaining parties and persons.   Thank you for your understand and compliance.  Sincerely, [my name]   [edit 3] I removed the number from the email.  Please include the number in both the title and within the body.

RBI,3e092a,nd4spd1919,2,Tue Jul 21 00:11:51 2015 UTC,"I dealt with this all last year. The numbers are spoofed and are not Pac-West telecom calling you , but yes...a scam nonetheless. The criminals will go onto forums looking for existing phone numbers with complaints then spoof to that number with autodialing voip software such as xlite .   Spoofing already known complaint numbers makes the layers of the onion they create harder to peel and track down.   You should contact the FTC after every call you get and file a complaint with their online submission form. They do not action every complaint but if enough complain, they may take a look.  You should also contact your Federal politicians to have robocalling laws changed from civil to criminal. The laws they violate are CIVIL and they know this. All they will get is a fine and a slap on the wrist and start up the next day again. Once they change the penalties to criminal, there's really no incentive for the criminals to stop.    In the meantime , change your phone number. By answering and talking to them, they will just call you more and sell your number as a ""live"" one for others to contact you.   Before I gave up on them and got my numbers changed, I found out the criminals don't really like being called criminals. So if that's your cup of tea, then exploit it I guess.   Honestly, it's better to just change your number and do something positive with your time. I know because I was there with you too last year. It's beyond annoying, I know.

I figured that the more info I could get about the situation, the easier it'd be for the police. I guess I am just scared of them saying ""oh, you only have a few memories? can't work with that so... dismissed!""  I remember the name of 1 hotel and 4 cities... I confirmed his email address existed, but I think it has been deleted since. I know we sent emails back and forth so I was trying to ""hack it"" but as soon as I clicked ""forgotten password"" it told me that the email was incorrect (although the name wasn't available for a new email)  He lived in Barcelona. I can talk about some stores we went... the amusement park he took me to... but I don't remember any actual names. I know his mother caught him with me. She was PISSED. Basically, he made me leave his house while he calmed his mom down and tried to convince her that I was 17. Maybe if I find him, his mother will testify about what she saw..."
RBI,3dtbtt,goldaline,8,Sun Jul 19 08:05:21 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me asking, have to spoken with a psychologist/social worker/etc. about what happened to you at all? From reading your post, it seems to me like you have a lot of unresolved feelings about what happened and what may happen with this case. It could really help sort all the thoughts and emotions you're experiencing right now if you're comfortable opening up to a professional.  That being said, you don't have to conduct your own investigation or solve the case. Others here probably know more about that area than I do, but please don't feel burdened by not having all the information right now. If you feel that you want to report, then maybe you should. You may know more than you think you do, and what you do know could possibly lead somewhere.

I have a boyfriend that loves me dearly and I have finally started to make sense of a lot of things that have happened in my life.  The thing is... one of the psychologists seems invasive. I mean, it's good. I seem to be making progress on the memories I have... but the new memories are not letting me sleep. They are creating this sense of urgency for justice. I just... I can't believe he is still out there, unpunished!  When I was in his house, I remember feeling so bad that I took a bunch of pills. He found me somewhat unconscious somewhere in his house where I had hidden, and put me on the couch. I remember him discussing the idea of taking me to a hospital, but ultimately decided not to. So he left me there... not knowing if I'd die or not. MEH. Such a POS.  I'm not 100% ready yet... but, in a few months... I think I may follow your advice and just go ahead and go to the police station. If nothing else, at least I tried."
RBI,3dtbtt,missileman,2,Sun Jul 19 09:01:29 2015 UTC,"That's great! I'm glad to hear that you're doing well and making progress.  It's hard to judge your psychologist just by the bit you said, but if you're feeling uncomfortable with them for whatever reason, it's okay to find another provider. Or even to let them know how the sessions are triggering memories and affecting your sleep, if you haven't discussed that already. Feeling the need for justice is completely understandable, and I know other survivors that have also wanted to do some of their own investigating before speaking with police. So everything you're experiencing now is very common and normal. I think it helps build up some of the power that was lost when being abused.  I'm really sorry all of this happened to you. I can really see why you want him brought to justice and why you fear for others safety. He is absolutely atrocious for what he did.  That sounds like a good plan. And I think your thoughts regarding it are good as well. Unfortunately, you will never be able to control the outcome yourself, but you'll never know what that outcome is unless you try. And if that's something you want and are ready to do, then go for it - I think it might be able to  bring you some closure as well."

I have never felt like I could report what happened to me to the police. Basically, I have always been told that he was my boyfriend and everything was ok.  A few years ago, I started really thinking about my whole childhood, and all the issues that I have (depression, ptsd...) If I supposedly loved him, why did I try to take my life multiple times as early as 11 years old? Why did I cry after he had sex with me? I asked my mother ""so you are telling me that I was very 'mature' but explain this to me: if I was so mature, why did I ask for teddy bears and toys? Would YOU date a boy that asked you for an interactive toy that told bedtime stories?"" She always answers with something stupid that doesn't even make sense like ""ACTUALLY, you were 13 not 12"" Umm actually, it happened during both ages but who cares? Like 13 is better or something. She refuses to admit that anything that happened was that bad and believes we are a ""normal family.""  You guys have given me strength to go on an report what happened to me.

RBI,3dtbtt,Arnox,2,Sun Jul 19 15:51:13 2015 UTC,"If you like her, it sounds like she would be very understanding of how the memories are effecting you and will be able to help you with the obsessions.  What he did was NOT okay, even if he was your boyfriend (which in this case, it doesn't even feel right to call him that since you were manipulated into dating him). It was not okay with you, so what he did was not okay in any way! I'm sorry that people have told you this and tried to make you change your feelings about what happened.  What your mother told you is awful. Obviously I don't know exactly why she would say those things, but sometimes survivors and the people around them (secondary survivors) try to rationalize what happened as ""normal"" because they think that it will make things go back to normal, even though what happened wasn't normal and thinking so won't fix things at all. It sounds like your mom could do well with some trauma therapy as well, but of course that is easier said than done.  I'm glad you posted here and were able to find some strength in the replies. When you are ready to report, I hope you are able to do so, and I hope the police are sympathetic and understanding.

I have friends who've been in similar situations before (depression, suicide, self harm) and it is usually possible to geolocate them accurately enough to send help.  If you have a way of contacting them, see if they are replying. Replies are very very reassuring both for you, because you know they are alive, and for them, because they know you are listening to them and want to communicate.  It is always best in these situations to seek professional help but if the police aren't listening then searching around their social media profiles for anything that may help identify them. If you have a phone number or email address search it on facebook as it may lead you to their profile and potentially their family members. Googling the email address in quotations, for example ""emailaddresshere"" will bring up any pages that email is listed on, which can sometimes lead to websites which have a whois, blogs, or similar.

The first thing you get is a auto answer with a menu, and then you have to listen for the department you want or the operators extension.   Then you have to ask.  This of course is ignoring the fact that it would be highly unuseful because you're surely going to get some stores where the employees who answer won't know the names of the entire electronics dept.   I worked at target in college for 3 years on the Flow team, stocking shelves and the backroom from incoming trucks. I never knew the name of each employee.   And my cross-trained role while I was there, where I subbed in times of need? Customer service desk, where I was responsible for answering phones amongst other things.   And all of this assumes you have a complete list of all the numbers and don't have to navigate online to each store indv webpage to get the number of each store.

The thing is, in previous months this person has told people that he is pursuing legal action against a perosn I don't know who is also doubting the legitimacy of some of his biggest claims. I've had a gut feeling about this for a little while now, and it was only untilt oday when someone else who knows the full story told me about their doubts, that I realised it wasn't just me.  I think you might be right about the customer shirt website, however the only doubt I have about that is that it is quite old and of quite good quality.  The issue with the logo is that I can't find it anywhere on the internet. I've searched every variation of wording to describe it and I've come up with zilch. All I can find is Melody Ranch Motel in Texas, who don't do merchandise, and a TV show from like the 80's, whose t shirt look nothing like the one I own.

The Californian Melody Ranch is more likely to be involved in publishing and such, as the other result appears to be a relatively small bar/entertainment business. The California and Texas results above seem to be the most relevant things I could find surrounding Melody Ranch.  There was a television show by Gene Autry which went by the title of Melody Ranch, as well as a location, film and radio show. It could very well have been fan made merchandise, as I haven't yet seen anything similar enough on google images. I haven't found anything linking it back to an actual brand nor any other similar images, so I would say that it seems a bit fishy.

Now I'm thinking a lot of his stories don't add up, even stories aside from this.  I've had no reason to ask him again, and have no sort or segue into asking him about it either :/"

RBI,3d4uo1,JaDoPS,4,Mon Jul 13 22:36:26 2015 UTC,Could these possibly be the trainers of one of the males? They have striping and a black tab at the top of the laces similar to the ones in the image. It doesn't seem bold enough to be black stripes so I'd say that the shoes have either silver or grey stripes. They seem more silver than grey so you're looking for white Adidas trainers with silver stripes.  http://i.gyazo.com/a99688cda8528c3be505357f0fcda38d.png http://i.gyazo.com/9fdbd7250eeb2964236e25a6b7c27945.png

RBI,3d4uo1,offtoChile,2,Mon Jul 13 16:17:11 2015 UTC,"The hexagon pattern is present on these black adidas trainers. The stripes are in the same place which is rather typical for that brand but they aren't very noticable as they are also black on that shoe type. Maybe we're looking for a different variation of this type, such as these or these white trainers, again with stripes?  http://www.expresstrainers.com/shopimages/products/extras/AD64261WB-adidas-bbneo-skool-lo-sole.jpg  The second persons shoes would therefore be responsible for the dotted prints in your picture.

RBI,3d4uo1,_ilovetofu_,2,Mon Jul 13 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"Also a little bit of further analysis  If I had to describe the clothing of the person carrying the television I'd say that they're wearing a navy blue cotton hoodie and plain grey (probably cotton) tracksuit bottoms. They'd therefore be looking for that and the previous described nike trainers. Could be wrong.  Not sure about the Adidas trainer individual, I would say that they are using some kind of waterproof or pac-mac due to the way it folds and seems slightly less fabric-like. Would be looking for some kind of navy blue or black waterproof tracksuit. There isn't any branding so there's not that much to go off for it, unless there are some more common brands?  Do you have a recording of them moving or just the stills from the security camera? Could be used to get a rough idea of gender or age?  If you know how high your ceiling is you could also use that to gauze how tall they are, which will help with descriptions and searching for the clothing potentially?  I'd assume they are local? If you think they are, maybe when you next go to your nearby store, take a look at the clothing section for similar tracksuits?"

RBI,3d1zsu,Tha_Dude_Abidez,6,Sun Jul 12 21:46:54 2015 UTC,"From the earlier thread, /u/Tha_Dude_Abidez is looking for the artist of the picture/the author of the letter. Reading carefully through the photo album and comments over at /r/anime, I was able to find just some simple facts to go on:   The letter mentions a girl (Rebekah) returning to Pensacola, FL. That gives us a location for the drawings and likely the artist. The letter is signed by Robert and Darcy. A friend of theirs (Jennifer) is mentioned early on. The artwork is signed Shimataki. A Jim Bob is mentioned in the letter too - that's the stuffed animal in the drawing. The artwork is dated to October 14, 1995 - the letter was undated, but was probably written close to the date of the drawing. The author mentions schooling ending for Rebekah and him still being in school. I'll make the assumption here that they're high schoolers at this point in time, with him possibly being younger than her. The author makes it very clear in the letter that he at one point dated Rebekah and he still loves her. The author is religious in both his writing and his artwork. He may have been connected to some church in Pensacola. /u/UnavailableUsername_ figured out that the anime-styled girl with the blue hair probably comes from an anime called Moeru Onii-san as the character Kaede. It was aired in 1988 in Japan, and was probably never aired in the US. /u/GVBN claimed that the long quote on the first picture is a Biblical quote. /u/Figure15 figured out that the white text to the left of the blue-haired girl says ''Someday"", and the text in the other drawing is simply Japanese for Rebecca/Rebekah."

I imported the track into iTunes, and looked at it in Get Info. Under Lyrics is listed:    We didn't sleep too late. There was a fire in the yard. All of the tress were in light. They had no faces to show. I saw a sign in the sky: Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans. I heard a voice in my mind: I will try, I will try, I will try. I will try, I will try, I will try.     We saw the dragon move down. My father burned into coal. My mother saw it from far. She took her purse to the bed. I saw a sign in the sky: Seven horns, seven horns, seven horns. I heard a voice in my mind: I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord. He said: I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord. He said: I am Lord, I am Lord, I am Lord.     He will take you. If you run, He will chase you. He will take you. If you run, He will chase you 'cause He is the Lord.     'Cause He is the Lord... Seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans, seven swans...

License plate format:  D12-ABC (2010–present) ABC-12D (2007-2010)  Since the first letter looks like a F/P, then there's a good chance it's a 2009-2011 vehicle (assuming the owner didn't sell his newer vehicle to 'downgrade' to an older ML suv).  I also think this vehicle does not have the parking sensors, so besides that and the sticker on the rear door, it should be easy to confirm the vehicle once you have the plate (done).  If the cops are involved, one would think they could narrow down the list of possible vehicles by narrowing down by make, model (M), color (silver), date range (2005-2011) and some of the characters in the plate.

My friend said the officer was totally dumfounded that she was able to provide a license plate number.

Or, they're holed up there with a Fargo machine and a bunch of blank mag cards, encoding them with stolen credit card info purchased off the Darknet, getting a verifiable address, then going from casino to casino to get cash advances.

She was also dating a Doctor at the time or close to it.  This was info I was not aware of.  I was aware that she had been going through a lot of pains in the 6 months to a year prior to her death, and did not know what the cause was.  It was abdominal pains that she had gone to a doctor for many times but a cause had not been diagnosed yet.  My theory is that potentially she was exposed to pain meds during this process and that combined with a night on the town may have caused her to either intentionally or accidentally commit suicide via jumping off the balcony of her apartment.  That's the best theory  can come up with right now but at least I don't have to wonder about a murderer being free of his crimes at this point.

Some states' DMV website allow you to search all vehicles on the road, so if you're in one of those states, you could check how many black S-Class vehicles, in that year range, in your county, are still on the road.  I also feel like this robbery was extremely targeted.  They didn't drive by slowly and turn at the last second (unless you didn't include that clip), they walked to the side of the house first (side least visible from the direction they were coming from), before grabbing the bright yellow Minion-themed Amazon box, and when they left, they went back to where they came from, instead of just continuing the original direction.

The Mercedes-Benz W220 was a series of flagship sedans which constituted the Mercedes-Benz S-Class during the early to mid-2000s. Development for the W220 S-Class started in 1992,  with the final design, helmed by Steve Mattin being approved in 1994 and frozen for production in the first half of 1995.  The completed prototypes were presented in June 1998. The W220 started production in August 13, 1998, and the C215 CL-Class coupés started production in 1999. The W220 was a replacement for the earlier W140 S-Class after the 1998 model year. Compared to its predecessor, the W220 had somewhat smaller exterior dimensions but offered more interior space, particularly in the long-wheelbase versions (although the trunk is smaller than on its W140 predecessor). Production of the W220 totalled 485,000 units, slightly more than the production totals from the W140. Production ended in 2006 when the W220 was replaced by the W221 S-Class and the C215 was replaced in 2006 by the C216 CL-Class.  In many European countries, the diesel S320 CDI version became the most popular model, making it the first S-Class in which a diesel engine achieved broad appeal.

RBI,3bqy3l,TreeOct0pus,0,Thu Jul 2 01:34:27 2015 UTC,I share an office with someone. I left my computer  unlocked once.. he said I shouldn't leave it unlocked or my boss would get mad at me. But I doubt he would care. I just met the guy. To me it would be like why would he do it. It's a new work environment for me and I haven't disclosed my relationship to my office mate.
RBI,3bqy3l,gurgle528,2,Thu Jul 2 01:44:59 2015 UTC,"I share an office with someone. I left my computer  unlocked once.. he said I shouldn't leave it unlocked or my boss would get mad at me.   I have to admit, that throws a bit of a red flag up to me, but I'm probably being oversuspicious. I was wondering if the pics were only on the One Drive, or were they in emails, phones, etc.? Again, since it's hard to tell where the photos were accessed it would be very difficult to find the stalker.   Still, it's much more likely that they it was physical access to one of your our your girlfriend's devices, rather than an online ""hacker"" wannabe. And it's fairly likely that person uses Reddit.  Bets of luck, I was a victim of online stalking and harassment, and I know how much it sucks."
RBI,3bqy3l,TreeOct0pus,2,Thu Jul 2 02:12:57 2015 UTC,"I just can't imagine someone I work with, on good terms and hardly know would even bother doing this. But now I'm starting to wonder. I'm just really paranoid.  Everything was backed up was on one drive. We have sent stuff via imsg and email, and links before. So I don't know exactly what s/he has. I feel like It's someone who knows us very well..or her most likely, and got access somehow. I don't know if anyone with that skill would waste it on something so petty.  Last reply for the night. Sleep time."
RBI,3bqy3l,gurgle528,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"Ok, sleep well.  Since you seem to be a private person with a small circle of friends, I wouldn't be 100% sure it's someone you know in real life or has a real motive for you to break up. Unfortunately there's a lot of people out there now that get their kicks out of harassing people online just to get a reaction and knowing they are making someone uncomfortable, shocked, whatever. Basically of passive-masochism via online anonymity. There's a subreddit, creepypms- and many of the people who post there have have no idea why they are getting harassed, or who's doing it. Personally, I'd keep looking, but never respond to them anymore.  Best of luck."
RBI,3bqy3l,DarkyPoo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:06:00 2015 UTC,"I decided not to respond to them anymore. Just keep record of the e-mails. I was thinking that it could be someone from the past. But I haven't burned anyone badly to want them to come back to me, and frankly it's been years. I tend to keep my personal and gaming lives separate. With work I haven't been able to talk to my gaming buds in a while/as often anyways. Most of them don't have my e-mails. This person may as well just be messing with me to get off to it as you said. There's always the ""why me"" question though."

RBI,3bqy3l,Cobra45,3,Thu Jul 9 07:13:58 2015 UTC,"I agree with this, because something seems weird to me.  OP said that the target was likely their SO.  If this stalker was someone they both know and wanted to get at the girlfriend, why not email the girlfriend directly? Maybe this is someone from reddit (or elsewhere online) who only knows OP and tried to dig into their life for whatever reason, then discovered the pictures and the girlfriend? But then (s)he only had OP's contact info."
RBI,3bqy3l,Cobra45,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:24:59 2015 UTC,"I missed this comment. I mean if this person got into my e-mail(s) or whatever they would have my SO's info as well. But yes what you said is a very much a possibility. I refuse to strike anyone out completely. So perhaps someone online or reddit, but they wouldn't know anyone to get into my e-mails so easily or have physical access. This situation is perplexing."

Our social lives are small with work and school. I do believe this person knows us both. I don't know how they would know even if we gave into his/her demand to ""break up"" unless they are stalking us. We got rid of all our social media accounts."
RBI,3bqy3l,usernameicanremember,16,Wed Jul 1 13:58:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm.  People like this usually aren't careful. There might be contextual clues in their writing as to what corner of your social circle they belong to. The fact that they're emailing you on Sunday and overnight suggests they likely have a job with normal hours and are doing this from home. They haven't given you a way to contact them to tell them if you broke up, which suggests they feel close enough to you that they would find out without you telling them. Anyone listed as part of the ""everyone you know"" is another clue.  Unfortunately, new stricter revenge porn statutes won't come into effect until November. However, you might be able to find help invoking older laws or laws concerning cyberbullying. I am not a lawyer or legal expert, this is just a suggestion."

Maybe even ""it's not like you can hurt us"".... then let him come back and say ""maybe I will hurt you"" then you get the police involved."
RBI,3bqy3l,The_dev0,11,Wed Jul 1 13:53:02 2015 UTC,I have only replied to two e-mails before. But he or she doesn't acknowledge my replies. I don't think they look at the e-mail service again. But for example when I got the e-mails over night when I was sleeping. The e-mail would have expired and they wouldn't even see it.

I recently started talking more to a classmate of mine and talked a bit more after class hours. We are both networking security majors (the irony). He's the smartest guy I know that would be able to pull something off like that. And he browses reddit too which is why I was hesitant to post earlier before. Another guy I used to be close with for years lives in Cali but we are no longer friends and is also into network security.  My SO doesn't have a lot of bright friends around her.

Personally, I'd laugh it off and mock the stalker as much as possible in order to make then expose themselves - anyone who thinks that they will be able to break you up with childish threats of displaying normal human behaviour can't be that sharp anyway.  I also find it hard to believe that  someone would risk prosecution for no personal benefit - what do they want besides you breaking up (Really? Is this high school?) And how will they know they have achieved success? Are you going to put an ad in the paper advertising your relationships demise?  The whole thing sounds as stupid as hell.

If this person got access to an e-mail of mine with contacts that he could send it to friends, family, professors and anyone I really came in contact with via e-mail.  The pictures/videos are really exposing but I guess not everyone has the guts to not die from embarrassment/shame from being exposed. I don't know where else he or she plans to upload it.

I am not sure what you could do from there unfortunately short of file a harassment complaint, which might be difficult from here since the police seem less than cooperative.  You can get the IP address via your Microsoft account as well, assuming they did not connect via proxy or VPN. To find it, go to outlook.com or onedrive.com and log in. From there, click your name in the upper right hand corner and select account settings.  In account settings, select Security and Privacy, and under there go to Recent Activity. You can see a log of recent sign-in attempts, and get the relevant IP addresses.  Once you have that though, you can at least determine the city of the attacker by punching in the IP address at this website: http://www.infosniper.net/index.php  While it can't get you the name of the attacker, it should at least point you in the right direction.

RBI,3bbcdi,cryptenigma,9,Sat Jun 27 23:55:37 2015 UTC,"I hope you are already looking for better pro legal advice.   Meanwhile,  I was bored ... and also pro-labor. So... It seems mostly, you can object and complain all you want, but the main recourse is to allow them to hurt you (blab about results,  fire you, otherwise do something bad).. and then you can go back after them or sue.     I wouldn't want my job back if these folks were real jerks anyhow.   Nolo says Indiana is pretty free with employee testing.   Only Federal employees are really protected;  but if the test is done in a way that is discriminatory (can't pick on anyone already in a treatment program,  or just choose certain groups of folks based on sex/age/religion, etc)  .. or if the test is embarassing/unprofessional - having someone watch.. you might have some recourse.   TestCountry repeats some of the above, but adds stipulations about employees that are engaged in certain safety-sensitive jobs.   Work in mines and as School Bus drivers are examples. No exceptions are specifically discussed for prescription drugs.    AlwaysTestClean  *I suspect they may not be very reliable, but they don't get very specific.      They reiterate that Indiana law is very open.. certain folks must be tested, but anyone can be.   They say that having a test administered by 'unqualified persons' could mean trouble for the employer.   However, they don't elaborate, and I don't see any rules that explain what 'qualified' means. Also, they say (but don't support) that Indiana has ruled drug tests are not a medical exam.    If this is true,  it removes some protections.  (1) The employer must pay for all required medical exams. (2) The protection of information under HIPAA.  If a drug test is not a medical exam, the results might not require your consent to release under HIPAA (you might have a case with Feds if you don't consent and want to sue).. and you could be required to pay for your own test.      I'm not a lawyer (IANAL).. but I'd suggest gathering all the info you can about the employer and the test itself. Your most likely path to a resolution is going to court - but this usually means a lot of hard feelings, lost wages, and unwanted press.    Additionally, it can be expensive, even if you find a good lawyer willing to take the case free (pro bono).     If something bad happens,  the employer will look bad later if..   - they don't have a comprehensive policy about drug testing, which is in an employee handbook, book of rules,  or at least on a poster / public memo somewhere.   - the drug test comes up positive, and they don't try to confirm the test.    With a professional test, this would mean a quick test in the office,  then sending part of the sample out to a registered lab for confirmation.    In your case, it could just mean asking you to see a doctor/lab for a certified test to confirm the positive.   Cheaper tests get more false positives.    [WebMD[(http://www.webmd.com/news/20100528/drug-tests-often-trigger-false-positives)     If they don't follow good procedures - especially at least the instructions on the box - they could be violating your rights.   The people administering should be washing hands, perhaps wearing gloves.   They should explain the test to the test subject, and not interfere.    People get a 'shy bladder'.. if they decide it is taking too long,  the test should be thrown away, and a new one opened when urine is available.    And so on..   There are lots of foods, OTC drugs, and prescriptions that are not made of illegal drugs - but might trigger a positive in some tests.     I can confirm that poppy seeds can trigger a positive for opiates .. but a confirmation test can discern the difference.  Certain herbal remedies, teas, even cough preparations can trigger positives for various drugs.     If the test doesn't ask you for a complete list of possible foods/drugs before they collect urine, they could be making a mistake that will look poorly on them.      I don't see any way that you(your family member) can legally refuse and not expect to get fired.    You can make sure your urine is as clean as practical,  and protect yourself with knowledge.    If the worst happens - and they come up with a false positive, be prepared to fight or at least find a better job.   /r/askHR  /r/legaladvice"
RBI,3bbcdi,MiceElfAgain,6,Sat Jun 27 20:00:00 2015 UTC,"There might be some rules, depending on the circumstances of the drug test, and what the results are used for. Since they gave the option to complete the test in a month, what is the big deal? I've been at lots of jobs with mandatory testing.   Of course, they were also union jobs.     The best way to protect yourself (or friend) is to find out what they're testing for, and get an independent test done by your own doctor / lab within a day or so.   If the company is using a cheap test, it may be unreliable.    Provide them if you wish, with your own medical test results. Or, take your chances with their test, and if a bad result, then go get professionally tested.

RBI,3bbcdi,EyeHamKnotYew,9,Sat Jun 27 21:16:36 2015 UTC,You can be terminated for wearing red shoes. They can say they THOUGHT she was high and fire her unless she had an employment contract or was in a union. Tell me where the wrongful termination comes from?
RBI,3bbcdi,gmz_88,4,Sat Jun 27 21:44:10 2015 UTC,"It would not meet the legal definition of wrongful termination to fire somebody over suspected drug use.  In most jurisdictions an employer can fire an employee for any reason and at any time. Likewise, an employee can quit at any time for any reason. The only reasons that would be illegal to fire somebody is if because they are a member of a protected class or for retribution over whistleblowing.   Common misconception."
RBI,3bbcdi,mdax8414,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:19:59 2015 UTC,"You're hired ""at will"".  They can make up some other reason for firing you and lie about you ever having taken the test."

Just because you do an arguably manly job doesn't mean you don't get to be all ""I had to walk 8 miles to school in the snow everyday on me."" I don't care what your frontier justice bullshit says, the law is the law and if you're going to make someone very uncomfortable illegally.

RBI,3bbcdi,neovngr,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:26:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, the law is the law and if you want to understand why /u/jeepdave is right and you're wrong, look into the term at-will-employment.  You will see what he's trying to get across to you, and why the tests he's referring to are practical for weeding out those who would fail it even if you turn around and fire them for another reason immediately thereafter.  That happens in the real world, I've seen it many times and have never ever heard of it leading to a wrongful termination suit, and genuinely baffled at how you think a wrongful termination suit would come of this.  It'd be one thing if it were 'surprise sexuality-preference testing day', that would open the door to wrongful termination claims; drug testing would not (drug users are not a protected class, so in an employment-at-will scenario, drug testing won't be treading anywhere near legal boundaries)"
RBI,3bbcdi,sherlocksammy,0,Sun Jun 28 03:06:33 2015 UTC,"Obviously you guys are not reading the OP. The test is not given in a professional way, making the test taker uncomfortable. The test taker is saying they have no problem being tested, but do not like the fact that two/three people are watching him/her. This isn't a situation where you can tell someone to man up and take it, because at that point it becomes sexual something."

RBI,3bbcdi,dGaOmDn,11,Sat Jun 27 18:28:03 2015 UTC,Employers have the right to drug test employees.  Also Indiana is a right to work state and the employer can fire her for any reason.  I'm surprised they didn't when she refused the drug test.
RBI,3bbcdi,Ramady,22,Sun Jun 28 00:18:35 2015 UTC,"That's not what right to work means. Right to work is a set of laws that places restrictions on unions. You're looking for ""at will."""

Document everything. Institution of changes to drug testing policies (including the addition of randoms) typically require a month's notice before they begin.  Soapbox time:  Saliva tests are cheaper, faster, more accurate (fewer false positives), less invasive, require little to no training to administer legally, and typically don't require lab confirmation for a positive.   The only reason UA's are still the norm is that Testing Labs sell programs with them as the ""best"" option to employers, when really they're just the most expensive packages (aside from hair tests, which always use a lab and take too long for employers to want them, even though any positive UA also has to go to a lab) and employers take it upon themselves to go with the storebought tests to ""save money"".   There's no law requiring employers to use a specific kind of test, at most they're required to maintain a ""drug-free workplace"" and saliva tests would accomplish that. Really all the UA does is discriminate against occasional marijuana users while letting users of harder drugs or abusers of alcohol off the hook."

This is my honest advice since I worked/work in careers where drug testing at random is a possibility.  IF she's not doing drugs and is worried about losing her job, have her get drug tested by an authorized lab to prove she doesn't do drugs, then just play ball with the company and do as they say and be done with it. Then probably look for another job.  honestly, it isn't exactly illegal to drug test employees. Virtually all jobs I've had, had to do some sort of test on me.  good luck."

You can check by looking at the property records of the house.  You will be able to make sure the foreclosure was at a tax auction. Just google County Name Property Records.  They're almost certainly online, although you might have to pay a few bucks to access them.  Look at the amount of the lien, then the amount of the sale.  The difference is yours.  Look up unclaimed property but if it was a recent sale, it might not be there yet.  Call the tax office to ask the procedure.  Things may become complicated if you and your siblings are underage.

After a certain number of years (depending on the State) the new lien holder can file for foreclosures and take possession of the property.  On certain properties (ones that have no mortgage I.E. ""fully paid off""), for a very small investment, like less than $10K someone could end up owning a property worth hundreds of thousands.  This rarely works out - but the Tax Lien holder has very little risk and will ALWAYS at least get their original investment back + usually some interest.  You can read about it here."

RBI,3avl0l,PancakesForLunch,3,Wed Jun 24 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"The subpoena will specifically state what reddit is required to give them.

RBI,3avl0l,spurgeonryan,3,Wed Jun 24 14:27:15 2015 UTC,"Yep. It wasn't archived. Also I think the purpose of the subpoena is to show the link between his ISP or mobile phone IP and the account, although he could just say someone borrowed his phone or computer I suppose."
RBI,3avl0l,zimm3rmann,2,Wed Jun 24 15:09:29 2015 UTC,Subpoena? Why? Just click on the person's posts?
RBI,3avl0l,spurgeonryan,7,Wed Jun 24 04:45:47 2015 UTC,He deleted the incriminating posts and also the police/courts need to be able to prove he was the one who made the threats on reddit through IP address records as far as I know.
RBI,3avl0l,HydroThorium,4,Wed Jun 24 05:27:25 2015 UTC,You still can't tie an IP to an individual person.
RBI,3avl0l,WYLD_STALLYNS,4,Wed Jun 24 10:15:07 2015 UTC,That is true. Plus there's the possibility that the defendant used something to mask his IP from what I understand. That's why I'm looking for anything similar to read about.

RBI,3avl0l,poppinwheelies,6,Tue Jun 23 21:30:19 2015 UTC,By who?
RBI,3avl0l,poppinwheelies,-23,Tue Jun 23 21:33:35 2015 UTC,"Your lawyer. They can't just compel reddit, a private company that's a third party to the ongoing litigation/court battle, to hand over user information."
RBI,3avl0l,zimm3rmann,12,Tue Jun 23 21:55:27 2015 UTC,"If it's a criminal investigation they can. And no company would refuse. The only security is companies that don't keep records at all, because then they have nothing to hand over."
RBI,3avl0l,poppinwheelies,-8,Tue Jun 23 22:02:01 2015 UTC,"Its not a criminal investigation if OP, the victim or plaintiff has hired a lawyer that serves as the cases main litigator.   That role would be a da/prosecutor if it was criminal and he would be the one securing the subpoena, not his private lawyer.  He sure made it seem like his personal/private attorney was the one seeking the subpoena."
RBI,3avl0l,zimm3rmann,9,Tue Jun 23 22:53:20 2015 UTC,The detective called me back and said she was going to issue a subpoena for the defendant's reddit records.   Detective. Not attorney. The detective (a woman) is issuing the subpoena with the help of the prosecuting DA.   The defendant committed a crime against me. I reported the crime to the police. The detective called me several days after I filed the police report and the detective is writing up a subpoena for the defendants reddit records because they contain evidence pertaining to the crime.   I am surprised they are writing up a subpeona and want to know if anyone has any information or experience with subpeonas of internet records.  This is all new to me.
RBI,3avl0l,poppinwheelies,2,Tue Jun 23 23:21:16 2015 UTC,"I have had to subpoena records from businesses many times. You'd be surprised at how often it happens. Some large corporations have staff dedicated solely to receiving subpoenas i.e. telephone companies, Facebook, etc."
RBI,3avl0l,zimm3rmann,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:42:11 2015 UTC,Really? Do you have any insight as to what happens as a result of subpoenas for internet records? Is it different for corporate concerns than for criminal charges?
RBI,3avl0l,DeleteWhenGilded,3,Wed Jun 24 03:51:17 2015 UTC,"I would assume it's similar. They (in this case, The Prosecutor's Office) would subpoena the records and Reddit would then supply them with a transcript of every post, comment, and (likely) PM. I'm not sure if these records would then become a matter of the court record (public record) or not. That would depend on the prosecutor or the court.  Criminal cases can take a long time to prosecute and even longer before it goes to trial (if it ever does). Hope that answers your question!"
RBI,3avl0l,5iveby5ive,2,Wed Jun 24 03:58:15 2015 UTC,"That is really helpful, thanks. Do you know of any cases I could read about where internet records were used as evidence?"
RBI,3avl0l,poppinwheelies,0,Wed Jun 24 05:30:04 2015 UTC,Really curious as to how someone committed a crime against you over Reddit.
RBI,3avl0l,Erilaz,3,Wed Jun 24 10:16:40 2015 UTC,A death threat would certainly do it.
RBI,3avl0l,poppinwheelies,0,Wed Jun 24 14:18:48 2015 UTC,I personally wouldn't consider a death threat to be very credible if I didn't know anything about the person. I had handfuls of people threaten to kill me over Xbox years ago. Didn't pursue it because I didn't feel it to be a credible threat.
RBI,3avl0l,poppinwheelies,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:21:12 2015 UTC,"Totally agree. It would have to be pretty credible and enough to rightfully frighten you for your safety. 99% of Internet ""death threats"" are laughable."
RBI,3avl0l,5iveby5ive,2,Wed Jun 24 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"I will follow up with details once the court case is over. It might be awhile. I can't find any articles on the internet about anything similar. It seems like most cases are related to copyright infringement, which doesn't really apply to my situation."
RBI,3avl0l,buschdogg,0,Wed Jun 24 13:19:11 2015 UTC,"Can you tell us in general what kind of crime it was? Like slander/libel, hacking, fraud, identity theft, etc?"
RBI,3avl0l,5iveby5ive,3,Wed Jun 24 13:55:26 2015 UTC,Sure. The crime itself was a physical attack. The reddit portion is evidence of the defendant admitting to the crime and making additional threats.
RBI,3avl0l,buschdogg,5,Wed Jun 24 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"He didn't, it sounded like a criminal case with personal representation in tow."
RBI,3avl0l,poppinwheelies,15,Tue Jun 23 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"Of course not. My lawyer has nothing to do with the subpoena. The detective and prosecuting DA are writing it up. I'm not suing anyone, it is a criminal case."

RBI,3arf3a,hg57,2,Tue Jun 23 03:12:41 2015 UTC,Another avenue you might take is the DNA tests on Ancestry.com. It'll match you up with family based on your DNA and you might find some family members on his side if you aren't able to find him directly.   My family has been doing them and we found out that my grandfather's dad isn't who we thought it was so we've been trying to track down that information. Kinda hard when everyone has passed away tho.   Good luck!

The final line appears to say 'Love Jim' or 'Love John,' followed by II or perhaps 'Jr' or something else very short that would make those couple of short symmetrical lines when it's blurry.  This looks very much like a thumbnail to me.  It makes me wonder if the original exists somewhere on your relative's computer but someone downloaded the wrong thing at some point. It would not scan at that resolution.  ETA: Very sorry for your friend's loss. I hope your friend gets closure.

Ideally you note the serial numbers, get the videos, call the police the moment the stuff is stolen, follow the guy with an ongoing 911 call and then when they arrest him and view your video they would have the probable cause to search him and find the matching serial numbers.   Then in your victim impact statement make sure to state the amount you are sure you lost.  Also notify the gym so that he is banned and then you don't have to encounter him regularly.  Also go to the real police if possible as the campus police tend to be cover-it-up as their first mission."

RBI,386t7p,captnkurt,9,Tue Jun 2 11:31:42 2015 UTC,"If it is being done for financial motivations, it's a long con. Think months and years rather than weeks. Your romance (or friendship) with the fake person will progress until you feel very close to them, then one of two things will happen: They will want to move the relationship forward, but some financial hardship will be the way (plane ticket, visa cost, etc.), which they won't ask you to remedy, but will be humbled and grateful when you do so, or some great tragedy will befall them and leave them destitute and desperate, which again, they won't ask you to help with, but instead will give you a heart wrenching play by play of their life crashing and burning. While they are doing this to you, they will most likely be in various stages of pulling this same con on other people, using other profiles. This can be a very profitable business for an accomplished con artist.  The other scenario is that they are doing this purely for psychological reasons, and enjoy having a fake relationship where they can be someone different than who they really are. Sometimes these people will extort a little money as well,  but their main focus is the thrill of the game, and they are not professional con artists. These are the type of people that are the focus of the 'Catfish' show.   Either way, you are best off ignoring them or shutting them down.  Edit: clarity  TL;DR: It's a long con scam"

Chiming in to say that while I think it's probably a financial scam, there are also people who create fake profiles to get more information on others. I'm an educator and have seen it with students. The motive seems to vary between someone having a crush on someone and wanting more contact with the person without outing themselves, and downright nosiness.   This is way scarier to me than some kind of con. With a con, there's nothing personal, but if someone I knew in real life tried something like this, I'd be a little freaked out."

That'd make it some sort of con artist.  It might be someone trying to gather information about you.  It's statistically more likely that the account is there to quietly promote a business indirectly.  That link to the review on the Cottages of Baton Rogue would be the most likely thing.  Go look at that page.  They're desperate for promotion.  They're all 'wannabe-internets' with their memes and their bright colours trying to lure people over there.  Do you belong to an enormous facebook group?  Have you belonged to large facebook groups for the years that this has been happening?  Are you involved in any college/university stuff that's visible on your facebook account?  Edit: the 1 star review left for that business?  I found it.  The business replied by saying they had no record of someone with her name staying with them.  The list of one star reviews is very long, with no details given.  Months later the reviews are all five stars.  I wonder if this is a tit-for-tat marketing battle.  Either way, the account that friended you is not a real person.  They don't want to scam you, they just need that active account so they can do facebook junk with it.  I know, I do it too."

They're fake users, created worldwide, and employees of sorts for companies that sell Facebook likes. Having thousands of likes for your business is valuable, and there are illegitimate ways to get those numbers.  Facebook is very good at determining which users are real and which aren't, and my guess is the primary grading mechanisms they have are to look at the user's network of friends. If they're all friends with each other, forming a self-connected network with limited connection to real, external people, they are eventually spotted as fake and the whole group is deleted.  My guess is these people have adapted to connect with real people so they don't stick out so painfully to the cleanup scripts."

RBI,381fyn,Samwambam,4,Mon Jun 1 18:10:59 2015 UTC,"If he was charged, then he would have been out on bail until his court date unless he's considered a danger to the public or the police didn't think he would turn up to court.   One of my brothers was on remand for 6 months for 'threats to kill' and also ABH amd a few other things but he was unstable and would have been an obvious threat to the public. I would imagine a general fight in the bar wouldn't have being seen in the same light, unless it was less fighting and more assault.  Incourts is a good way to see when they went to trial, if they applied for bail ect.. But they won't tell you what for.  We do have remand centres but my brother was put into a cat A prison. I think it could depend on location, not totally sure."

RBI,381fyn,double2,3,Mon Jun 1 18:07:19 2015 UTC,"Also worth noting that the prisoner can be placed in a jail ANYWHERE in the UK, so it's unlikely he's in or around Lancaster. Jails are categorised as A-D. For assault / GBH / ABH (which it sounds like he commited), he would be in a B or C prison (probably dependent on any previous convictions and behaviour)."
RBI,381fyn,studavis,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:28:40 2015 UTC,Good to know that he is likely in B or C. That will help me narrow it down.
RBI,381fyn,studavis,2,Mon Jun 1 18:11:16 2015 UTC,"The chances of him being in prison rather than fined and deported for such a crime is pretty low.  Edit: sorry, don't know why I assumed he wasn't a native brit. Either way, prison seems pretty unlikely for the offence."
RBI,381fyn,manyshaped,1 point,Mon Jun 1 11:42:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I know, right? A drunken brawl should not end with a 4 year sentence. Something doesn't add up."
RBI,381fyn,iiamiami,3,Mon Jun 1 18:11:39 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily, if he was sentenced for ABH or GBH (quite possible in a drunken brawl), that is treated much more seriously than simple assault or wounding. There's a lot of factors to be decided before the CPS will put him up for prosecution - they only put forward cases they have a reasonable expectation of success and that includes under which offence he is tried."
RBI,381fyn,iiamiami,2,Mon Jun 1 19:17:33 2015 UTC,"And he was on probation for a prior fight when he was arrested for the brawl in question. That might add substantial jail time, right?"
RBI,381fyn,trubleshanks,4,Mon Jun 1 19:46:26 2015 UTC,Almost certainly. Breaking probation normally means an automatic jail sentence if convicted of a second offence.
RBI,381fyn,GnomertEFC,2,Mon Jun 1 19:48:20 2015 UTC,It is possible he never went to jail - for a bar brawl and/or threatening behaviour if there wasn't a weapon involved he may have just got community service.  Court transcripts are really hard to get - they aren't normally published. It might be worth having a look to see if there is a local newspaper with a website as a lot of these will run articles on local convictions.
RBI,381fyn,t90fan,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:14:49 2015 UTC,I know... the whole story seems odd to me that he would go to jail for 4 years.

The voices are often created by speech synthesis and are transmitted in a wide variety of languages. The voices are usually female, although sometimes men's or children's voices are used. Some voices are synthesized and created by machines; however, some stations used to have live readers.  Many numbers stations went off the air due to the end of the Cold War in 1989, but many still operate and some have even continued operations but changed schedules and operators.

It broadcasts a short, monotonous  buzz tone (help·info), repeating at a rate of approximately 25 tones per minute, for 24 hours per day.  On very rare occasions, the buzzer signal is interrupted and a voice transmission in Russian takes place.  The first reports were made of a station on this frequency in 1982.  Its origins have been traced to Russia, and although several theories with varying degrees of plausibility exist, its actual purpose has never been officially confirmed and remains a source of speculation.

It wasn't exactly scary, just weird that someone would go through the effort to make this and send it out to multiple people he'd never had contact with, some of them getting multiple copies.

He is a pathological lier so talking to him directly hasn't worked. He squirms out of every corner you put him in and it only provokes the hostility.

He is dating my family member and she is very attached to him and we are trying to as loving as possible show her that what she believes to be true about him is actually false. We have more proof than what we know to do with. He has her in his grasp and isn't letting go.   He actually told us this once, his ex girlfriend left him and moved out of the country to get away from him and he flew to go find her.... He didn't though but what kind of person is the psychotic that they would do something like that... And he used that as an example of how much he loved her.  My cousin just doesn't see it."
RBI,36tpla,fearlo,6,Fri May 22 03:44:28 2015 UTC,"Well, if your cousin wants to be with him, there's not much you can do about it assuming she's a legal adult.

This one trips most fakers, what was your battle buddies name?  I know for me I'm only had a battle buddy in basic training in the Army I have a marine friend who had one too.  As for big companies google some company info find out what's where and askn specifics about his day to day act like your interested in what hen has to say and keep giving compliments about how cool the job is, interject random shit to keep him talking. Ie: he makes gummy bears... Say, I love the red ones I heard they are made completely separate for the other ones.         I've got a brother who's a pathological liar so I've had some practice with him.  I can try and give you more tips about questions if you want to give more deets about what he does."
RBI,36tpla,vulpe_vulpes,8,Fri May 22 02:10:03 2015 UTC,Yes please. We've caught him in several lies already. We know for a fact he was not military. We've talked with a commander from a non-specific marine base and he had people look in to it and he got us in to contact with a provost marshal and he told us without a shadow of a doubt that this guy was not nor has he ever been in the marines.

You have to be careful not be confrontational or your going to push your family member away.    The sad part it he'll continue to lie and manipulate her behind your back and she's going to start making excuses about how it wasn't a lie.

It won't be long until he begins to have medical emergencies, a death in the family or investment expenses that he will come to her for. If he is that kind of guy, there's no telling how many women he has done that to.

Are you sure you have the right name of this guy? His Facebook name might be bogus, but If you got a glimpse of this guy's real name from an ID Or something you can call the companies he said he worked for pretending to be a recruiter and ask if you would re hire this individual. Look up laws regarding references but in my state that's all they're allowed to ask. Once they reveal he doesn't work there, boom! You got him. If you want to call him out record it. Say hey I got a buddy who works at ""x company"" and denies you working there. If he says he does ask him salary, companies core values, and maybe some more specific info like who the Vice President of the company is or some other shit that's super specific to the company.  Tell me about the lies you caught him in? If you guys don't know where he's getting his money from and he's this much of a douche it could be from welfare, illegal means or his parents.  I say welfare cause people on it are usually insecure and lie about their income to cover up their shame. Could be the source of hostility and secrecy.  It could be illegal (drug trafficking) which would explain his very illegal behavior...  Or his parents got money and shower him in it. That's why it's important to follow this fella. Start notating his habits and routine, if he breaks routine find out why. Take photos of the people he interacts with. Take a good look at their face and try to notate their facial features, eye color, height, skin color and hair color. Go on this assholes Facebook and look for those individuals on his friends list or people following him on Twitter or Instagram. Snoop on them and see what those people are about. If they got events that they're going to that they post on Facebook event pages, be there, stalk the event in silence. Stick to the shadows and make small interactions with random people.  Create a web and notate what each individual person's relationship is to the liar. Also just browse his friends and see if you can find an abundance of military guys.... If there's very few friends in the military ID be worried.  I used to be an informant. I worked for a private group that worked on behalf of the IRS. We had all the toys and did some fucked up shit and abused our powers. I regret everything but if I can use my knowledge to help honest people I'll be glad to offer you advice.  I'm able to extract loan documents, bank info... I was apart of a ""network"". We shared info.

He for sure isn't military I have had friends look in to it and it has been confirmed false.  I need help with the less than easy information.

I apologize if it came across that way but that's not what my goal is. I'm just writing out the options here. It's a sensitive scenario due to what he has said.  My investigating turned up that he was not military nor has he ever been affiliated with the military as a contractor. There are many other details as well of what he has done.

Given the information available, I suspect you are likely the ongoing target of a remotely installed software intrusion. There are commercially available programs  which allow infiltration of systems via key loggers and other monitoring functions, to include things like webcams. Many of them are undetectable by regularly available anti-malware software. This would account for any activity after changing passwords, etc.  The complete reset of the phone/device/computer MAY rid the system of the software, but such software can be disseminated via photos, links, and other methods, meaning you could be targeted again.  I would recommend doing a hard reset of all computer/devices/phones, changing all emails, and scrubbing associates to your social media accounts. Thereafter, you would need monitor your online activity to ensure this software (if this is the case) is not reinstalled.    EDIT: Forgot a word. Apologies."

RBI,352y1u,Miroudias,1 point,Fri May 8 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"No problem! I do lots of ancestry research including DNA testing, so I can give you some more specific tips:  If you are male, I think you should get a Y-DNA test from ftdna.com. If you can afford it I think you should also get a DNA test through ancestry.com. If you are female I guess I would recommend ancestry over FTDNA because more people seem to use ancestry.  After your results come back, you can download your raw file and then I would recommend you upload it to the website GEDmatch.com. GEDmatch is a free website that is very cool. They allow uploads from ancestry, FTDNA, and 23andMe. Because of that and because it's free, you'll end up with a lot more potential matches as well as some advanced utilities that allow you to do some more in-depth comparisons. If you donate any amount to the website (remember, it's free and it's run by a guy who does this in his spare time) then you get access to a few additional utilities. I've donated and I don't really understand those features yet, but they seem very interesting and like they could be helpful for situations like yours.  I would just say that you should tread carefully with this - Recently I asked my moms aunt to give me her DNA to help me with ancestry. I ended up discovering that my great aunt probably has a different father than my grandmother and that she probably has a half brother. She never knew any of this and I didn't handle this information as delicately as I could have and I think she's very hurt by it. So while you know what you're getting into, just be aware that the person on the other end may be receiving some really shocking news that they were not expecting."

RBI,34vnkx,vegasmacguy,3,Tue May 5 15:33:09 2015 UTC,"most modern listening devices use gsm cellphones that sit in an innocuous device. The listening party has to dial a phone number that automatically answers and allows them to listen. As someone else mentioned this device would need power to last more than a couple days. Look for power strips,  small black boxes plugged into a USB cable, or any other device that you don't remember installing.   The small black boxes can be hidden inside of other objects as well, such as the base of a lamp. So look for things that have an extra cable going to them that doesn't make sense.   Another thing to do that's fairly easy is to take off your outlet covers and light switch covers. The ones easiest to access and out in the open are going to be the most likely to have been tampered with. Open them up and see if there is any device wired in. Be careful though since sockets and lights have a lot of power going to them and touching or probing around behind one can get you shocked. If the screws are painted then sometimes you can see the ones that have been removed by looking where the paint may have been scuffed on the heads.   Keep in mind, cameras can be hidden in anything as well, but some of the more common places are in alarm clocks, clothing hooks, smoke detectors and light switches. Scrutinize anything that is mounted to a wall or sitting on a desk that you didn't put there yourself.   Even if you did put it there, take  a closer look since it's easy to open most devices and place a device inside."
RBI,34vnkx,vegasmacguy,1 point,Tue May 5 16:31:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  I did some googling and found out that listening can be done via a ""corrupted"" SIM card placed in a GSM Cellphone. Thus, I have two questions:  1) When the listening party dials the number and your phone automatically responds, do you actually see a call taking place on the phone's display?  2) Does the SIM card really need to be ""tampered with"" in the first place? I mean, does the listening party have a chance to listen on you by only knowing your phone number and without having given you their own SIM card?"
RBI,34vnkx,vegasmacguy,1 point,Sat May 9 06:19:25 2015 UTC,"1) When the listening party dials the number and your phone automatically responds, do you actually see a call taking place on the phone's display?   Generally speaking for this type of hack, you won't see the incoming or outgoing call.    2) Does the SIM card really need to be ""tampered with"" in the first place? I mean, does the listening party have a chance to listen on you by only knowing your phone number and without having given you their own SIM card?   While it can be done directly on the SIM card - by far, the easiest way is to access to your phone for a few minutes or even access your Google/Apple accounts. There is plenty of software that will install on the phone and give them not only the ability to listen, but see all text messages, your browser history, remotely watch through your phone's camera, etc..    The SIM hack can be done but requires things like a gsm modem, specialized software to retrieve and crack your SIM's encrypted signature, software to craft and send altered commands/messages to your phone. This can be done remotely, but they still need to be fairly close or have high level access to a cellular network for it to work.  If you're concerned about your phone being hacked, what you'd want to look for is:  Signs of something running in the background   Excessive battery drain Excessive data usage Your phone heating up when it's sitting idle   Signs of intercepted signals   Calls failing the first time around Text messages taking excessively long to transmit or receive Rapid changes in signal strength or data connection when you're not moving   Unfortunately all of those issues can also be attributed to unstable cell networks, buggy apps or cheap phones."

Check previous video for similar clothing the same day, and for a group of similar figured for a week or so.

I'd consider that a fairly high end set-up when compared to the general population, seeing as us over at /r/ECR are most likely going to fall into that category of the above example for the overall industry, since 80% of the subreddit is made up of exactly those types of setups, but I'd say the industry as a whole we probably account for 20% of these types of setups.

It's hard to accept in a small business where you might feel like your employees are your 'friends' or 'like family', but a lot of times the feeling is not mutual.  My father owned several small businesses when I was growing up and it always hit him hard when an employee he thought really liked him was caught stealing. We had one guy who even lived with us for a short time when he and his wife broke up who was stealing merchandise. It was really hard for my dad to accept. Even when he once accidentally intercepted a call to the guy from a 'customer' who wanted to arrange a time to meet after the store was closed to pick up a bunch of stuff for ridiculously low prices, even then my dad still had trouble accepting there wasn't some misunderstanding.  My point is, don't assume that you know your parents' employees and don't assume that because your parents have been kind to them or loaned them money before, whatever, that they would have loyalty to the shop.

(If she did, that would be odd all by itself.)  In order to charge a long stay at Ritz, plane tickets, as well as an LA hotel stay, the purchaser would need to either physically present the credit card or use an online travel company (Expedia, etc.)  Online travel companies require the following information: full credit card number, expiration date, and the 3-digit CVV code from the back of the card (4-digit on the front for AmEx). If all of this information doesn't match exactly, the charge will not be approved. They also require the billing address, and while there's more flexibility here, generally at least the zip code needs to match.  It's not terribly hard to imagine he could have sussed out the billing zip and father's name during the four months of courtship, but how did he get all of the account information?  Sorry for saying so, but the facts as presented do, at least in my mind, introduce the unpleasant possibility that your sister may have more culpability than she is admitting.  ETA: In another comment you say your father canceled the other charges at LAX. Did your father go to the airport with your sister when she went to meet this guy? And it all went down while the three of them were at the airport? I'm getting confused about the sequence of events here."

Hmmm, somethin' stinks in here.]   she claims to have handed the card to the server   If true, then we know that this isn't how the account was breached.   we live in az     So why did your father go to LAX to cancel the charges?     I honestly don't know if he did it or her     Not sure what you mean by this.     I don't think she would do that     Perhaps she didn't. You know her far better than any of us. I'm just saying the facts as presented here strongly implicate her.    Anyway, has she talked with this guy? Asked him what's up? I mean, let's assume for a moment he's not a total moron. Why would he steal your father's credit card info to purchase a trip he intended to take with your sister?

RBI,34bf2b,darthV8R,5,Thu Apr 30 07:44:52 2015 UTC,Correct! We've figured out that it was a Bluetooth headset charger. It was the only cord I saw coming from underneath her bed. I've still gotta search my mothers room tomorrow.
RBI,34bf2b,bollykat,5,Thu Apr 30 08:22:40 2015 UTC,Do you have a laptop with a camera on it? Maybe she's accessing that remotely.
RBI,34bf2b,alientity,1 point,Fri May 1 02:16:38 2015 UTC,"Thinking the same thing—also I'd expect at least one camera, given the description of what's going on."
RBI,34bf2b,alientity,45,Thu Apr 30 07:54:16 2015 UTC,Now you're thinking inside the box!  ...I'll show myself out.
RBI,34bf2b,alientity,51,Wed Apr 29 22:19:15 2015 UTC,"in order for her to monitor audio and of video,  she needs remote access.  There are only a few options:    cloud enabled device,  such as DropCam direct access to an IP enabled camera/microphone, and port forwarding/VPN access remote access to a PC/laptop  which is equipped with a webcam or connected to a video/audio input   So what I would suggest:    change wireless network password;  this will knock unauthorized wireless devices offline trace every network jack,  find out what's really plugged in cover all webcams with a piece of tape or paper change passwords in router,  PCs,  etc   Keep in mind that maybe she's using a spy gadget (cameras can be hidden in pens, books, boxes, pillows, etc.), so you really need to think out of the box.  Last but not least, the device needs power.  Since you are talking about months, it's obviously not solar powered, so battery is  not an option.  Check all outlets, verify where each cable goes (and if it goes to a power strip, 'audit' that power strip as well)."
RBI,34bf2b,alientity,10,Wed Apr 29 20:53:02 2015 UTC,"She's not that tech savy, so I would say those suggestions might not apply to her. She doesn't know much about computers. At least not to do that much. There is a laptop in her room that has been unplugged and closed on her desk since she has left, so I'm assuming it's dead, and has been dead. The thing that gets me is she knew the exact location of the chair once it was removed from her room."
RBI,34bf2b,bollykat,19,Wed Apr 29 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"Well she might have gotten help from a good friend, and in this case, she's too far away for a simple technical solution, so something is up.  Log in to your router, look at the list of 'attached devices' (sometimes also called 'LAN devices'.  If you know she is monitoring, shut the internet down for a few hours.  If she's low tech, maybe she's using a neighbor, or even an inside job, but shutting down the internet will tell you that.  This is definitely a fun 'quest'."
RBI,34bf2b,wrayjustin,13,Wed Apr 29 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"I'm going to check my network here in a few. I've already unplugged everything that was in her room (lamps, printer, etc.)  It's only my mother and I here, and after what my mother went through early this morning with her, I highly doubt an inside job was possible. We were thinking a friend of hers could of came in, but my mother sleeps across the hall from her room with her door open, and I'm up all night until 6AM. Plus we have loud dogs, so someone breaking in would of been noticed right away.  Definitely fun, but god she's psychotic haha."
RBI,34bf2b,wrayjustin,5,Wed Apr 29 21:04:42 2015 UTC,"Yea that's pretty bad.  I'd offer to come help figure this out, but I doubt you are even in the same state.  I'd also love to see a pic of the chair exactly as it was, as it will help figure out viewing angles, etc."
RBI,34bf2b,ducking_shot,5,Wed Apr 29 21:09:25 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately since her finding out, I did put the chair back into her room. Just to save my mother the grief.  I'm from Pennsylvania though haha"
RBI,34bf2b,VernonMaxwell,6,Wed Apr 29 21:17:15 2015 UTC,"What type internet connection do you have?  Type of router?  She might be using a pinhole camera, or have a full size web camera hidden in a box/book, with a tiny hole for the lens (a method I've used myself).  BUT changing the wireless password and accounting for each physical network connection would account for that, plus it would show up in the attached/connected devices table on your router web interface.  If you can take high res pics of the room, we could definitely give them a look and see if anything stands out."

This is not indicative of an emergency.  A person may still healthfully decide that facebook is a waste of time and suspend their account in order to focus on the real world.  Or there could be a million of personal reasons.    You seem to be dwelling on a moment from long ago, and to be angstful to reconnect with somebody.  It leaves the impression that you are lonely.

For one thing, he himself didn't mention the money idea first (I think). Yet I agree that this being his first post is strange (implying he created the account for this sole purpose, which is strange, as these posts tend to be more 'in the spur of the moment I decided to say this' kind of stories).  Basically, I have no way of telling if his claims are true or false, and we have no post history to go on. Maybe he just wants to be seen as a good guy. In any case, he's not currently harming anyone. However, should he actually follow through on the group-funding idea, he'll need to provide plenty of evidence; it's at that point at which someone should really grill him for proof.  In the meantime, the best anyone can do is just keep a tab on it; like I say, it's too early and harmless to justify accusations of scamming."

RBI,33ofa6,mindfulmu,7,Fri Apr 24 05:03:10 2015 UTC,"They are liable because of the T&C's of AMEX protects the cardholder, and always charges the merchant, I guess thats what they said.

I would imagine that someone would be investigating further into the stolen card as well, that can't be the only purchase that was made illegally with the stolen AMEX, and even if it was the only purchase, it's still quite significant in size I would imagine AMEX would want to investigate that a bit further at least?"

To find out their names try to see in which names deliveries are made at the building. If you know the names of other legitimate tenants, then you should be able to figure out which names they use in the scam business. Those won't necessarily be their right names, but getting them could maybe lead you to other victims of their scams.  Another option is to act like a delivery person with a package that has a damaged label where the name got torn off, but the address is right. Tell them that you are almost sure you can remember the name if they (the scam business'es receptionist, for example) can just tell you who works there. It shouldn't be too difficult to scan and edit some sort of shipping label (just not from a company that has easily recognizable uniforms).  Another option is to stick around and get all the license plates for those who work in the building and see if that can give you any info - heck, sometimes people leave addressed mail plainly visible in their cars.  Dumpster diving - get the mail and paperwork they toss out. Don't sort it in their parking lot, simply buy a tarp or painter's plastic to line your trunk and toss a bunch of their garbage in there to go through it somewhere more private. This may not even be illegal - just remember that if they are shady types, they may resort to violence faster than other people would, if they see you empty their dumpster.  Good Luck!"

These are the kind of things that stick with kids at this age because this is when they're supposed to be learning how to interact with the world, cause and effect.

That's definitely a 4th gen Chevy C or K (don't think it's 4WD, so it would be C, K is 4WD), with an extended cab.  I also think that's an aftermarket dual exhaust setup (stock goes to the side), and a customized paint job (it's very close to OEM, but can't find an example of this specific configuration).  If you want to be sure, post this in a chevy / truck subreddit, or on the chevy truck forums (there are some really large ones).  This is a rare configuration, so it shouldn't be hard to find.  That said, I see what looks like paint damage on the hood/cab, or maybe it's a shitty paint job/cover/wrap, so they can (or already have) change the color of the vehicle once they have left the scene.  There is also the badge on the extended cab door, which seems to be in the wrong spot (put back in the wrong spot after paint job?), unless it was moved for certain trim levels.  They must have been waiting for someone to enter/exit, as they snuck in using someone else's access (surprised the door stayed open long enough).  edit: this is one of the worst CCTV setups I've seen.  Everything is washed out, and too far away.  A license plate cam near the gate would have been useful/cheap too.

A guy got his laptop stolen from his house, but had one of those 'cloud services' installed.  Eventually (laptop didn't go online right away), he managed to figure out the public IP address the laptop was using.  Now normally, I agree, this can't be of much help, especially without a warrant/physical address, but in this case, the laptop was at a computer repair/pawn shop, which happened to have a CCTV system exposed to the internet (so just entering that IP in a web browser revealed the cameras).  The cameras, and the IP's hostname, allowed him to figure out where this business was located, call the authorities, and watch (real time) as the cops recover the hardware.  IIRC, the laptop was dropped off to reset the password, and obviously the business owners were not the brightest.  I don't remember if the person that dropped it off was the actual perpetrator, or a 'victim' who bought a used laptop off of craigslist."

This is assuming that you have a state mandated child support agreement in place and that the state is managing the child support payments.  If you have a private agreement between the two of you that the state is not intermediary then you're on your own for enforcement.  If the states have no record of her then she might not be.

Usually when people can't be found it's because they aren't working or are working under the table. Most of the search functions are automated now, but unless she owes you more than $10,000 in arrears, federal databases aren't usually checked.  One thing you can do is ask them to do a mail forwarding check at her last known address. They send an inquiry to the postmaster, who will provide the new address if she left one. If you know what state she's in, you can ask your case worker to contact that state for assistance. Be polite but persistent, document all of your interactions with the support agency so if (when) you have to escalate to a supervisor, you can calmly tell him/her everything that you've done to get your case moving.  Good luck. I regularly told custodial parents that we would get their money even if it was by deduction from Social Security retirement payments."

Now maybe when they do a search it does search all household members names, but maybe the search is only by the HoH only. If it's the latter then that might explain why they haven't been able to find her, perhaps the father is listed as the HoH."

RBI,32upgo,WestonP,1 point,Fri Apr 17 02:30:21 2015 UTC,I don't think it's a J because Oregon license plates don't cross their Js at the top. If the officer seems willing I may run 985 EST and 589 EST. I don't want to give him so many that he feels like it's a dead end and won't run any more.

I would have guessed that the last letter is a 'J' at first, but if you look at Oregon's plate font, the J does not have the line across the top that we see in some of the pictures, so it has to be a 'T' or an 'I', but it doesn't look like the ""ESI"" sequence is in use.

You should be able to search the assessor's records online with just the street address, and that will bring up all the details on the property, including the name of the trust and the mailing address related to the trust (could be the trustee, or could be the lawyer).

RBI,326cw9,SwimmingNaked,8,Sat Apr 11 00:35:25 2015 UTC,"Correct, you need a lawyer, not RBI. In fact, your father needed a lawyer to draw up the contract, and I'll bet he didn't do that, did he?"
RBI,326cw9,NEHOG,4,Sat Apr 11 00:57:44 2015 UTC,"As sad as this is, taking people on good faith may be a problem here. If its not a legal contract you may be screwed, but yet, you need a lawyer."
RBI,326cw9,WillHo01,1 point,Sat Apr 11 01:31:34 2015 UTC,As mentioned above - my dad has a lawyer. I´m just not confident that lawsuit will lead anywhere without the right evidences.  To make it clear: there are thousands of mailbox-companies in luxembourg being founded every year. They don´t get founded by single persons. There are bigger service-companies in luxembourg that do this for single persons - just like that guy.  I do think that this is organised fraud - depending upon the intention of the actual owner either towards all honest tax payers or towards honest businessmen like my dad.  I also do think that making the truth about these companies public is a good thing for the public.  So if there´s a hacker group able to get these information from the companies I would name - I think this would be a good deed for not only me!  So isn´t this a case for RBI?
RBI,326cw9,NEHOG,1 point,Sat Apr 11 09:29:57 2015 UTC,"He did go to a lawyer (notary) that helped him draw up the contract. The contract itself is not THAT bad. Yet that notary obviously, just as my dad, was not clever enough to see the risks in that luxembourg-company-construction. Speaking for my dad, the only thing he knew that Ebay is a luxembourg-based company, so the whole idea of making business with such a company could not be totally untrustworthy."
RBI,326cw9,mindfulmu,3,Sat Apr 11 09:16:16 2015 UTC,"First, I'm in the USA, and the rules are totally different much of the time.    In the US, a notary is not a lawyer.  In the US, your dad would file a lien for moneys owed, which would at a minimum lock the property and prevent transfer (sale) without the lien being satisfied.  See the lawyer NOW, not later. The lawyer will then tell you what evidence is needed. Don't chase all over creation chasing rainbows--get what the lawyer says you need which likely won't be what you are looking for.  I feel very sorry for your father, but talk to your lawyer first before throwing good money after bad.  Where a company is based doesn't imply anything other than that location is an easy place to create a company. In the US, it is the state of Delaware which is the favored place to make your company--but this means nothing about how good the company is.  I suspect that your father got poor (or no) legal advise going into this. However, not knowing the laws and customs where you are seriously handicaps my ability to evaluate this problem.  (International) business disputes are common.    Disclaimer: I used to teach law and ethics, and can tell you that with my advise and a few Pounds, you can buy coffee and perhaps a light breakfast--not much else. I'm unqualified to give you the kind of advise you need."
RBI,326cw9,SpaceGeneralAmerica,1 point,Sat Apr 11 11:55:23 2015 UTC,"In germany, a lawyer can also be a notary. Similar here: my dad´s lawyer did sth similar - difference is: first: that guy made that company owe him money, before everything started (so that if anyone later wants money from that company he gets served first), second: that company (secretly controlled by that guy) claims now, that our claims are irrelevant, as that guy never was allowed to act in the name of that company We will see him on monday, and I will speak to him. The first hearing is soon. ok / 5. ok I completely agree an feel really bad for not having been there, giving advice, but hey, I can´t make it unhappen that´s why international law is quite a good thing to study! :-)   Thanks for your comments!"

RBI,32259l,t3hcoolness,11,Sat Apr 11 00:57:55 2015 UTC,"Looks like the plate is following the AAA1234 format?  http://www.15q.net/us5/wa11.jpg  Obviously, this is all my opinion, and I could be wrong, but:  If that's the case, then the last 2 characters are 77.  I also think the character preceding those 2 digits is the number 5, so the best I can come up with is:    position p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7    candidates AAA1111 B - - 2,3,8,9,0 5 7 7   AAA1111 excluded A1 T1 F1 I,O,Q - - - -   candidates no pattern B S,G,R,O,P,Q,G,D,S I,J 2,3,8,9,0 5 7 7     (1) ATF combination is not allowed   I added some gridlines to the image, to get an idea of the letter positioning.  I didn't account for the plate distortion yet, but I can do that tomorrow.  http://i.imgur.com/8eLr1Hg.png  The truck is a 2006 Woodland Green Chevy Silverado Work Truck (2003-2006 generation, but design features narrow it down pretty well), possibly with the extended cab option.  Will update the post later, but the cops should be able to seriously narrow down the scope using this data.  edit: I've seen some WA license plates with a different scheme, while still having 7 characters, so I'm not so sure we can figure this out without spending a lot more time in photoshop.  So for now, I consider the last 3 mostly accurate, but find a police offers on good day, and you should be able to get somewhere.  I can try to spend more serious time on it this weekend, just need to let me know it's still needed by then.  License plates checked without any hits:  No Hits   BLJ0577 BLJ2577 BLJ3577 BLJ9577 BLJ0577   No Hits   BSJ0577 BSJ2577 BSJ3577 BSJ8577 BSJ9577   No Hits   BPJ0577 BPJ2577 BPJ3577 BPJ8577 BPJ9577   No Hits   BRJ0577 BRJ2577 BRJ3577 BRJ8577 BRJ9577   No Hits   BOJ0577 BOJ2577 BOJ3577 BOJ8577 BOJ9577   No Hits   BQJ0577 BQJ2577 BQJ3577 BQJ8577 BQJ9577   No Hits   BDJ0577 BDJ2577 BDJ3577 BDJ8577 BDJ9577   No Hits   BGJ0577 BGJ2577 BGJ3577 BGJ8577 BGJ9577   Will continue tomorrow."

RBI,32259l,alientity,3,Fri Apr 10 00:51:00 2015 UTC,Are the license plates still starting with the letter A?  Or what letter are we up to now?  It would allow us to narrow it down some more.

RBI,32259l,alientity,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:20:42 2015 UTC,Trucks can have the B leas and I've also seen it lead with a C in some cases.  But it is more than likely a B in this case.
RBI,32259l,Nerosquito,3,Fri Apr 10 06:13:10 2015 UTC,"Yep. From washington state here, he's pretty dead on with the candidates. I believe the 3rd character to be a J since there are no other letters on our plates that have that shape on the top right, and the second character to be a L for the same reason, just reversed. I agree with the rest. So that potentially gives us  BLJ[]577  [] being 2,3,8,9 or 0  With this information and the year/make/model of the truck you've got your dude."
RBI,32259l,alientity,2,Fri Apr 10 02:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not understanding where the L is coming from.  It looks like a C/G/S to me.  I added a helper graphic to my OP, will post a nicer version tomorrow (in a hurry)."
RBI,32259l,dGaOmDn,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:32:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the enhanced graphic helps. Definitely not L. It looked like a sharp edge, now it appears rounded with that graphic. The offset of the top of the 3rd letter being on the right (J) gives even more credence to it being a letter with a rounded top. O uses the same dye as 0 as well. So it could be C, G, O, S. It doesnt appear to be a letter with a flat top and rounded edge, but it could potentially be B, D or P."
RBI,32259l,alientity,2,Fri Apr 10 02:43:51 2015 UTC,"I've been staring at this too long, plus I have a few other things to take care of, but will resume tomorrow.  Love these kind of puzzles tho.  If we have to, we could straighten the plate on that truck, size it properly, so we could try the whole virtual alphabet :)    The make/model is pretty unique, hopefully that can get them going."
RBI,32259l,nameBrandon,3,Fri Apr 10 02:55:05 2015 UTC,"AAA1234 is only the correct format for a passenger car. For a ""truck"" it will be A12345A, B12345B, or C12345C depending on when they received their license plates. It can also end in a number or have two letters such as AB12345"

RBI,32259l,jeepdave,1 point,Fri Apr 10 02:17:18 2015 UTC,There is a possibility that it's BXXX777 because the image is cut off and you can't see the sides.  Edit: just saw the zoomed in version and it's most likely a 5.

RBI,320k5n,GodRaine,10,Thu Apr 9 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"Thank you for posting the original video like this, it's very appreciated!  I'll update my post soon.  To save some time, the 2003+ GMC Savana (I think this is the Long Wheelbase variant?) van in question appears in the video around:    File Time    G5827E4_15_20150407_173220.avi 2:31   G5827E4_15_20150407_174220.avi not visible   G5827E4_15_20150407_174720.avi not visible   G5827E4_15_20150407_175720.avi 3:15   G5827E4_15_20150407_180220.avi not visible    The van also has a defective driver's side DRL.  The roof rack also seems to have a shield for the 6' ladder, not something I see on a regular basis.  I also think this is the 3500 edition because of the badge on the door (not shown on the regular/2500 models afaik).  Doesn't seem to have much bulky cargo (you can clearly see the Nissan Altima parked in the back, through the rear windows), no cargo separation wall, etc., so I don't think he is a plumber.  I really think this is the plate:   AJ 3M254   Other options:   AJ 3MZ54   Note: the BMW is a 1995-2000 E39 I think (no angel eyes, but plain DRLs make me think it's a 2000)."
RBI,320k5n,alientity,5,Thu Apr 9 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"AJ 3M254 seems like a good bet. I was considering that the Z was a 2 as were many others; my thoughts were that the 2's on our plates are distinctively curved at the top whereas the top of that character appears straight, leading me to believe it was a Z. Either way, we now have four possibilities:   AJ 3M254  AJ 3MZ54 AJ 3K254 AJ 3KZ54   Now that I have at least confirmed most of the characters with you guys, I'm confident that we can give this info to the police and they can work with it further.   I really appreciate your help, /u/alientity. Thank you so much!"

RBI,320k5n,alientity,5,Thu Apr 9 17:26:24 2015 UTC,"I agree. The driver of the white van seems level when he arrives, and baked out of his brain when he leaves. Most of the people that I have shown this video to in my office have commented that to get that out of whack, that fast, must have required some very strong stuff. :P I have no idea whether drugs / alcohol were factually involved at all, but it's not hard to infer such a conclusion when looking at the incident."
RBI,320k5n,SickFinga,2,Thu Apr 9 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"The broken DRL will helpfully confirm if it's the right van.  It's obvious this guy is some sort of contractor (painter or satellite dish installer maybe), so I would drive around and see if he is doing any local work (why else pick that parking spot).  He doesn't seem to have much bulky cargo in the back, so I don't think he is a plumber.  At 3:17 in the 4th video, the van acts like it drove over something, is there a curb, or did he hit someone else?  I'm wondering if he gently tapped that Ryder box truck as well."
RBI,320k5n,DeepNorth,2,Thu Apr 9 17:40:58 2015 UTC,"I was checking very carefully to determine if the van hit the Ryder truck, but I wasn't able to conclude if it had. I do see what you mean about the van appearing to drive over something at 3:17. There was a dumpster back there because there's a construction crew renovating the corner unit of the building, turning it into a daycare; I'm unsure whether there was debris hanging around the dumpster that the van could have driven over.   We checked with the construction crew downstairs yesterday; two of the guys we talked to said that they did not know who that van belonged to and that they didn't talk to the driver, but they did see him pull in."

RBI,31yunc,metamorphosis,3,Thu Apr 9 06:53:53 2015 UTC,"most likely the case. It is a bot that simulates the behavior of real accounts, in order to trick the security measures.

Also called the Silverado by some folks, but didn't have that name officially until 1999 iirc, and it looks like this is the long bed version.  The 'square' wheel wells, large signal indicator lens on the front fender, grill and tail design make me fairly confident.  The only thing that's confusing me is the missing Silverado badge on the fenders, but maybe it wasn't installed on the early models, part of a trim level (I believe Silverado was a trim level at the time), or it was removed due to a paint job/debadging job.   A C/K owner/expert should be able to provide more details.  Because of the missing Silverado logo, and age, it should be easy to find if you could somehow get a large crowd to look out for this vehicle (maybe post a Facebook ad targeting your area?)  http://cimg.carsforsale.com/579309/26343C31-35F8-4434-8F64-09E79CF112A6_1.jpg  But please, upload original photos to a host which doesn't compress them, since it can hide crucial detail.

Presumably, the primary goal is to make the harassment stop. Identifying the harasser is not necessarily the most effective way to do this.  Do report it to police. If it is something that is if concern to them, they can track it down (and if it's not yet of concern to them, it's still good to have the previous report if it does escalate to that level).  Talk to your father's cell phone provider. Again, if it's of concern to them (e.g. The harasser is breaking the terms of his provider), then they can track him down and get it dealt with. And if not, they may be able to block texts from that number from reaching your father.  Finally, if it's a smart phone, there's probably a way to set up your father's phone so that texts from this number are instantly deleted without notifications."

She got 3 or 4 of these messages before I had had enough.   I just rang the number and got a woman who had no idea what I was on about. On a hunch I asked her if she had any kids that were allowed to play with her phone and she then said something like, 'I'll look into this' or 'I'll sort this out' and my mum never got one of those messages again.  How the kid got my mum's number or why he called it so many times, leaving these messages I don't know, but sometimes kids do weird things.  If you're really scared, call the police.

There is no moving of the body from the scene until the coroner gets there and does an investigation to issue a cause of death.  They usually don't release the cause of death until they have notified the next of kin.  Unless the body is in a precarious place, or in immediate danger of being damaged, nobody touches the body until the coroner gets there.  Every body goes to the morgue and then it is released to the family.  If no one claims the body, it stays there.

That would pretty much eliminate anyone dying in a hospital, yes?  That's fine if they release the body to the funeral home, that's what happens when you are in the hospital and you die.

I'm sure a decent amount of the people arrested would stand by the party line but I wonder how many others have even just a little of the information they're looking for and are (even if just subconsciously) desperately hoping for a way out that they just can't find or accomplish on their own. They'd be Scientology's weakness- devoted enough to have access to information but not devoted enough to spend years in prison for protecting the organization from the law.

A lot of them operate internationally, and they're all over the place, mostly preying upon the 55+ crowd.   The best way to make these guys pay is to reduce their profits. Get them on the phone and waste as much of their time as you can. The more people that do that, the less profitable their ""business"" model becomes.   They basically operate on the assumption that for every 10 people, one will be gullible enough to buy into their garbage, so the faster they can get through the 9 who won't fall for it, the more gullible folks they can find.

I suppose she is planning on guilt trip the new owners to give the dog back cause why?  Really classy how she started off the post saying she was a marine, which has nothing to do with anything.  It seems clear the dog was too much responsibility in the first place.  She gave the dog away after it imprinted on her, and now the second guy who gave the dog away is a jackass?  Perhaps some thought should have been given before she gave away a dog she had committed to raising.   The best place for any dog is with its original owner, no matter what the situation. Her condescending rhetoric sounds like she is still the same selfish person who gave the dog up in the first place.  I hope for the sake of the new owners she isn't able to find them and pull her whiny manipulative routine on them in person."

Well maybe this woman should have had a bit more common sense than to give her beloved dog to a ""jackass"".

It debuted as a concept car at the North American International Auto Show in January 2005. The production model of the Aura was shown at the 2006 New York Auto Show in April, with production commencing in North America in the summer of 2006 for the 2007 model year. The Aura replaced the Saturn L-Series, which was discontinued after the 2005 model year.  Although Saturn had never intended to use the Aura name for the production vehicle, the name ended up sticking as a result of the popularity of the concept.

RBI,2zxkxf,brkpoint,31,Sun Mar 22 19:38:55 2015 UTC,"A few things:  Your Paypal transaction should have exposed the name and address of the recipient of payment.  Have you checked to see if that is a real person?  Have you provided those details to the Chicago PD?  I would also file a report with the FBI, who has jurisdiction over interstate cybercrime, and may be interested in a case that involves ~125 victims.  If the individual named is a real and identifiable person, I would also consider filing a small claims court case against them for simple damages.  If the management company was truly hacked, it will be their responsibility to convince the judge of that.    Secondly, I would advise you never to use an untrusted system (Craigslist) to conduct this type of transaction.  You should use a system with mechanisms built in to ensure fairness for all parties to the transaction, such as AirBnB, or some similar platform.  Craigslist takes a largely laissez faire approach to transactional fraud-- providing information on buyer protection and the ability to flag listings.  Sites that verify seller and buyer identification and force reputational consequences for bad transactions go a long way toward weeding out scammers.  Lastly, if you're so inclined, I would be glad to do some digging on this.  If you PM me the details, I will check a few sources and see if that generates any useful information."

RBI,2zxkxf,russianpotato,18,Sun Mar 22 23:31:56 2015 UTC,"No it is the other way around.  If you purchase an intangible item the seller is not protected.

I just dealt with a case like this about 1 year ago.   Here it says it right on their website.  It clearly states the seller is NOT protected, so you should win as soon as you file a complaint.  ""Why doesn't Seller Protection cover deliveries made in person, or intangible goods (such as digital goods or services)?  One of the most important requirements for coverage under Seller Protection is proof of shipment or delivery. Since deliveries made in person and sales of intangible goods do not have verifiable shipping documentation, we cannot currently extend protection for these types of transactions.""  https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/security/seller-protection-faq"

RBI,2zxkxf,russianpotato,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:22:43 2015 UTC,Well then how come you get charged back (by paypal) selling things like bitcoin...? Riddle me that former paypal employee.  Also if you do a chargeback with your credit card via paypal won't paypal just put your balance in the red?
RBI,2zxkxf,aftiggerintel,2,Sun Mar 29 03:10:13 2015 UTC,Not necessarily for putting balance in the red on PayPal. That is done only if the chargeback is fully found to be fraudulent. IE most cases we saw where balance was taken to the red were people saying item never delivered however seller provides tracking to customer's door which was also provided to their credit card company who made the decision to accept the tracking or not. PayPal wasn't going to take funds from the seller when they have proof something was delivered to the customer. Now if it was a claim where customer ordered x and received a picture of x then it is a different story. So many factors that go on in a single case where not all of them are nearly as cut and dry as you'd think.      Bitcoin came along after I worked there but would fall into intangible items even if it is currency so neither buyer or seller would have any protection. That's why it is recommended for those types of virtual currencies to use a clearing house or crypto exchange.
RBI,2zxkxf,russianpotato,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:03:25 2015 UTC,"Well I've been charged back by PayPal customers, through PayPal. Along with thousands of others while selling intangible items, so clearly you can win a case when buying something that doesn't have protection!I think they just claim their accounts were hacked and that they didn't make the charge.    As far as the account going into the red I was saying if you told your card to pull the charge you made through PayPal I am pretty sure paypal will just debit your account for the missing funds and if you don't have enough you'll be negative."

RBI,2zlkdx,molotavcocktail,2,Thu Mar 19 20:24:47 2015 UTC,"sure, I recommend it because I once asked for help finding someone on RBI and didn't get much response.

RBI,2zkwm0,toucher,7,Thu Mar 19 13:01:17 2015 UTC,"If it's been turned off it's almost certainly been stolen, unless you know that the battery was low and it could have just depleted on it's own. A lockscreen won't stop anyone with Google abilities from wiping the device and flashing a fresh ROM, allowing them to use it like normal. You should have called the service provider and marked the phone as stolen. They will blacklist the IMEI (the phone's ""identification number"") on their network, preventing it from connecting. This would hinder, but not eliminate, the thiefs ability to sell the phone. He would probably then be more willing to return the phone for a small monetary reward. Good luck."

I did call ATT, who recommended waiting about a day and monitoring it to see if it comes back up on the net; currently, no calls, no activity and no connection to the towers.   Of course you're right, it could have been wiped and sold already. And if that's the plan of whoever has it, I want nothing more than to at least frustrate frustrate their efforts. Of course I'd rather get the phone back if I can!  I also need to start checking craigslist; I didn't do that yet."
RBI,2zkwm0,alientity,1 point,Thu Mar 19 13:42:48 2015 UTC,"If it's an older phone, maybe Plan B (linked in sidebar) might still work.  You could check craigslist for phones listed for sale since the theft, but unless it's a unique phone and/or pictures are included, that's probably a long shot.

From that, one can deduce that it wasn't freshly taken out of its packaging when given to him. Just a thought.   A commenter in one of those threads claimed to have several of those pins from ""Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum"".

I don't know where they were going it was a night where I was experimenting with some things. So my mind wasn't focused on it at the time.   When I arrived at home at around 6PM on Feb 28th it was just me and my other roommate. (I have two roommates total) Around 8:30PM (Around the time I started my 'experiment') I got sort of a frantic call saying I need to run a course or something along those lines. It turned up to be a search for his car keys. Now this was strange since his car wasn't at the house, but his keys were. Dunno how that happened. Anyways, he seemed worried, but they were right on the counter.   Moving on 9PM he comes home with 3 of our mutual friends, two wearing the pins, the other was not. Apparently they had gone and did this earlier in the day. He was acting weird about it saying he got ""accepted"" Anyways, I wasn't thinking much about it as I was starting to get distracted, he got his keys, and then left, saying they were going to a party or something.  Fast Forward, I end up chilling with my roommate(No Pin) the entire night and at about 4AM he asks me where our other roommate was(with pin) We were both under the influence so it was kind of weird, and this brought up the pin thing again.   About an hour later he comes home, seemingly sober. So it's 5AM, no bars were open, obviously, and he didn't seem drunk. So this was weird, but then again, I was under the influence. He came home, and pretty much immediately got pissed off over 3 beers we drank. This was strange, especially since I knew he had more in his room. He ruined the mood, me and my other roommate both felt shitty after. We went to bed, and I didn't get another chance to see this pin till this previous Saturday. We are all 25-27.

A new-age, Scientology sort of cult is just as (or slightly more) likely than a sex one, in my opinion. This would explain the atom/star symbol on the eye of the badge. Has your friend ever expressed interest in space or religion? Perhaps you should attempt to casually start a conversation on religion and spirituality, and be perceptive to what says or holds back. I think that this explanation suits the facts (as we know them) better than a sex cult.  As for the chariot thing, that passage is meant to be describing God's chariot, as seen in a vision by Ezekiel. Fun thought: some people attempt to use this passage as evidence for an ancient alien visitation. That's what got me on this train of thought to begin with. However, I think it more likely that someone (whom you pissed off with an angry comment at some point) is just trying to screw with you.  Also: I PM'd the person who claimed to have 3 of these from MMMM. I asked for her to take a pic of the badges to prove she had them and put this matter to rest. She hasn't replied, and it's been 2 days.  So what do you think of the space cult hypothesis? It still sounds to have an element of fantasy to it, I know, but it seems to fit your story decently. Worth speaking to him about it and, based on how the conversation goes, maybe even following him?  I'd like to hear your thoughts."
RBI,2z9t5m,areragra,1 point,Thu Mar 19 00:10:39 2015 UTC,That actually sounds way more possible. He is extremely spiritual and always have shown interest in space. Ever since he was a kid. He plans on going to space one day. Like he's really smart in fields of all religion and all aspects of space and has even taken classes on it.

I had a woman steal my identity and my stuff I knew who did it, had all the evidence needed to charge her, they didn't charge her because the DA felt it was not a strong enough case to convince a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.   It sucks but the police are literally the only ones who can do anything about a crime. This subreddit has absolutely zero authority to investigate/prosecute crimes.

RBI,2z2whw,mindfulmu,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:35:03 2015 UTC,"Oh how I wish it was that simple.   I am being tested (and awaiting results that have been delayed)but would save a lot of time and money if we knew what defects she had. My testing is very broad & varied genes & exons that could be related to this cancer, and still may miss something.  To test for a single known location of a mutation is so much easier, cheaper and faster.  Apparently there are a bunch of areas to look at even within the MEN subtypes- mutations (although most are known to be in a few spots), substitutions, etc. and its expensive.  If I had proof which mutation she had this testing would be covered by insurance instantly as well given the 100% penetrance.   She had other problems all diagnosed at once which may have been related to the same mutations. Anaplastic thyroid cancer is one of the fastest, deadliest cancers known to man. I am talking about 3.5 weeks from diagnosis to death with my mother.  Blink an eye and she was gone.  Once I have my results- If positive- to test my kids will be much cheaper and covered (if not free through some research programs given its rarity). I am anticipating it to be positive in me, and have been preparing for that. My greatest worry is my daughters and granddaughter... And she is what made me finally get tested- at age 18 mos she had a growth removed which can be related to these genes... scared the hell out of me when I read that kids as young as 3 with this have been found to already have thyroid cancer.  Interestingly, in reading the research about this defect, its theorized President Lincoln had this defect and passed on to his two sons who died of thyroid cancer very young."

I am the breadwinner, the health insurance, his caregiver, his advocate, his reason to keep fighting...  Wasn't bad enough for him to be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his bones, liver, lymph and lungs last year at age 47 (with no risk factors or family history).   It doesn't seem possible.   My best hope is that this isn't cancer, just a coincidence with the nodule, and I get my thyroid out with no complications and none of my rugrats inherited this."
RBI,2z2whw,mydogismarley,2,Sun Mar 15 06:33:57 2015 UTC,Well if she was tested couldn't you find her medical records to see which lab she was referred too? I'd assume back then you'd need to be referred by someone.
RBI,2z2whw,mydogismarley,0,Sun Mar 15 07:58:54 2015 UTC,"Tried that. The local records were purged many years ago and the doc is long retired now. I tried every place she was- hospital that did surgery, the docs office and the hospital she had 10 days of radiation at. Nothing..... I know the local hospital only keeps records 10 years from last visit which is more than the law requires.  Even called a few places that I was told was probably doing this testing back then, but they were not in business then and had no idea who was.   I have even pulled research that was done back then on these mutations, but nearly every one is from another country.   I was about to totally give up when I woke up from having a dream of her doc telling us he would put the specific type of cancer on her death cert for us and sure enough when I got the copy it was there! If only he had put the exact gene mutation as well that would have been even better lol!"

It may have been this.   I am hoping my tests are finally back Monday as well, but having her results would be confirmation and certainty they aren't missing something.   I am a bit worried now as ALL the other gene tests are back and negative except the RET still isn't resulted. Makes me think they are running a confirmation and also looking closer at all the exons.... I was told this one would be done before the others.....

Not Hopkins or Mayo or others you would expect, and a western or Midwestern lab.

RBI,2z2whw,mydogismarley,2,Sun Mar 15 09:51:58 2015 UTC,At least you can recall that is was a smaller university somewhere in the Mid-West ... that rules out a lot of time you'd spend otherwise.  You may also find that some labs specialized in doctor referrals while others concentrated on tests for law enforcement. Cast a wide net; then start to eliminate.

Also, if you've connected to a regional cable-internet providers WiFi (here in the states, ISPs now have some of their consumer equipment broadcast two SSIDs, the private one for the consumer and a public one for other subscribers of that ISP to use) they may have your MAC address on file. Reach out to their department, too. There's also a slight possibility it is on file with HP if you still have the service code.  Laptops (and also applies to phones) here at university are stolen all the time. A thorough log of students MAC addresses associated with their are kept. When reported to police, it's a simple matter of flagging the ID, and MAC addresses of the devices, and if they pop up again on / near the network, their position can generally be identified.

With or without #2, if going to the local law enforcement doesn't work, you may want to right a cogent, respectful compelling letter to your state attorney general--make sure you clearly and simply lay out the evidence for foul play or why further investigation is needed.

A lot of tow companies are downright predatory, sometimes to the extent of being criminal, however they're often only doing the bidding of the property owner (who may be the one that's actually liable).  For example, if it's in Phoenix, check out section 36-144: http://www.codepublishing.com/az/phoenix/html/Phoenix36/Phoenix36144.html (see 'B' in particular)"

RBI,2ybdxp,WestonP,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:12:04 2015 UTC,"If that parking rule wasn't posted, and you were parked in a unreserved or guest spot, then I really don't think they can tow you. But, again, it depends on what the laws of your area actually say.  I'd expect that the police might say this is a civil matter (a favorite excuse even when it's not entirely true), but you can still file formal complaints with the city or state, take it to small claims court, etc. Make life hell for these scammers."
RBI,2ybdxp,chainsawmissus,1 point,Sun Mar 8 07:18:48 2015 UTC,The most likely place to find an answer is in your lease.  Check the parking clauses.  You may have agreed to never back into a space when you signed your lease.  This will over-ride local towing laws.  If there is such a clause or your sticker was damaged or expired you have nothing.  Expect no sympathy or cooperation from the towing guy.  You are not his client.   If there is no 'back-in' clause in the lease have your most educated and well-spoken relative call in and claim to be your representative and explain the lease.  EDIT: Just noticed you were a guest. How do you know you were towed for backing in?  The sign says 'No unauthorized vehicles'.  The apartment manager probably just doesn't allow guest parking in the private lot and your friend who lives there is a dick for not warning you.

The hiker did not trust pass and go up the stairs. By the looks of the photographs, he didn't even make it to the stairs. The hiker went up the Moanalua way. I'm not a local so I don't really know any of the name of the ridges, all I can do is try my best to explain to others where we went and where it was that we heard him. We started the hike on on a trail about 20 feet from the Kulana'ahane trail. We had hiked about three hours up. We were yelling to each other to make sure the others were okay because we were so far apart. The wind died down for just a half a second and we hear a scream ""help me!"" It shook my up so bad that I had to sit down to even call 911. My friends were about 50 yards in front of me and little did I know, they were also calling 911. All 5 of us heard it at the same time. If we were going straight at the trail, the voice was coming from the left. It was coming from down below. It did not seem as if it was echoing nor did it seem very far away. The scary thing is is that after about an hour,once the rescuers were there, my friend and I were bound and determined to get to the top of the stairs so we decided to continue one, and the other three stayed where they were. As we were continuing at the ridge we could hear the firemen/rescuers down below whistling and calling for him. Again, the wind died just a tad and we heard ""I'm down here!""  My friend and I both stopped in our tracks and started screaming for him. It was not the rescuers. The voice was different than The calls from the rescuers. I immediately called 911 again. We stayed up there for about another hour without moving to try and listen for him again. The wind was so bad and the clouds are starting to roll in so it was hard to hear anything.   My friend and I that heard the last cry, are heading up the ridge tomorrow the same way that we went Monday. It's hard to explain where the location was that we heard it, as well as where the voice was coming from. So in an effort to find him were going back tomorrow when I get off of work at 730am.

RBI,2xcyyi,ravistay,1 point,Fri Feb 27 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"My first thoughts as well.  Its probably related to someone breaking in to steal his prescription, and the DEA agent was probably doing some face value analysis of the neighbors to see if anyone had visible signs of opiod abuse."

RBI,2xcyyi,rivalarrival,7,Sat Feb 28 02:22:26 2015 UTC,"here's my theory:  The elderly are often on a shit ton of prescription meds for various reasons.  If they have anything like fibromyalgia or arthritis (which is common in older people) they could be on various pain meds that are controlled.  An 85 year old man is an easy target to get robbed especially if he lives alone.  A druggie that knows it's an old guy could easily break in, steal medications, and sell them somewhere else.  This is where the DEA comes in - they want to stop whoever stole drugs and is reselling them on the street.  This is just my best guess, though.  I'd call up your local PD and ask about the agent that was on your door because there's another chance (unlikely, though) that someone was posing as a DEA agent trying to get information as to if you knew that your neighbor was on any kind of drugs.  Was he asking you anything like this?"

RBI,2x8wui,ChandlerMc,4,Fri Feb 27 13:09:00 2015 UTC,"Maybe obvious question but worth asking: did you look for security cameras in the area where dog was stolen? Even if no cams were aimed at car, maybe the punks walked the dog up the block or to a waiting car with readable license plates. Since you know the approx time of abduction, you can be specific when asking for copies. A pic of the car or the perps can be plastered around the area and online/ craigslist/ Longbeach subreddit. The high reward amount is good too since it's possible someone close to the scumbags will want/need the money more than they need that particular dog. I sincerely hope you find the handsome fella.   Edit: thru the magic of Google StreetView I found a camera at 1445 Cherry (looks like a hair salon). It's about 100 ft up the street but it points across Cherry kinda towards the mechanics shop. Maybe they walked w the dog in view of that camera (if it's working)... Just trying to do my part from all the way in VA."

Note that each moon diagram with six letters (all but the 3 o'clock and 6 o'clock have 6, the others have 5 and 4, respectively) contain M and N opposite each other at the dark/light intersections, and O and P opposite each other, at a shifted position.

Ronald Mackey of the Dumfries Police Department said that the video appears to be real but that police have confirmed that the victim was not killed, since he was interviewed after the fact.   later in the article   Chuck Feldbush, a retired Prince William police detective, was working a uniformed patrol beat in the Dumfries area in 1984 and said he knew Blythe and the victim. Feldbush, who could not remember the victim's name, said the man was a vagrant who lived in the woods near the dojo. The man occasionally was the target of a nuisance call, someone who would sometimes try to take food off people's plates at the Pizza Hut or steal just to get caught so he could spend some time in jail, where he would be guaranteed a roof and meals.  Feldbush saw the man in the days after the incident and noticed him limping.  ""You could tell he had been beaten severely,"" Feldbush said. ""He wasn't very cooperative and didn't want to pursue charges.""  Although police had heard that there was a video of the incident, it did not turn up until years later, sometime in the 1990s. Feldbush said that if the video had surfaced in 1984, he certainly would have pursued it ""as far as I could take it.""  ""There was some egregious behavior on that video,"" Feldbush said, adding that he saw it for the first time in recent days. ""And it has caused a fervor because of what people have been saying about it. You have an African American male beaten into the ground and he's allegedly murdered and the police did nothing. That's as far from the truth as you can imagine. They've weaved quite a tale here."""

This explains why it was swept under the carpet 25 years ago. Law enforcement shows no interest in persecuting this matter further, so it appears vigilante justice might be served. Note how his home is very close to a highway. Very easy to get away.  Some say this incident happened well after 1984: “Bobby Blythe was not transferred to the location of the assault until 1991 and he mentions getting an email in the video so it was 1991 or later.” There may be a point – the video may have been edited to make any statue of limitations apply.  An investigation has been initiated!  Update: Sources in the medical- and law enforcement community tell us that indeed, the victim must have died.

I still have more things to post but haven't because it started taking up a lot of time and work and life got in the way. Plus I like to vet information first before I put it out there. The first post I created is probably a good jumping off point for information that people might want to dig though. I will tell you this though... while that started off as Post A my feelings are it's now Post Z. Meaning it has all the starting hooks to find information but I'm starting to believe there is a lot more to it and while my initial thoughts are still on the same path I'm not sure of the conclusion. When I posted that I posted the limited information I had at the time. Does that make sense?

Here is my takeaway:  -Milo is RoP.  He and another guy Shade were running the job board.    -They are also probably acting as escrow or the cash pipeline as they are taking a cut that seems to happen before the contractors get their cut.  -I don't see anything that points directly to contract killing a target in the job board.  -I do see the requirement for a job that a contractor be bondable, which is a legal / insurance thing.  Or it might be used for a different meaning, but if not these jobs would probably be legit.  -I am pretty sure ""No UK w/w"" means no wanted or warrant status in the United Kingdom.  Not sure if this just means less hassle for illegal ops or if that indicates a legal job.  -The idea of sequester for pay on refusal really piqued my interest, especially because the duration of sequester was usually much shorter than the duration of the contract.  I really feel like there is something to be inferred from this but I just cant quite get it.  -They seem to have some kind of medical insurance scheme.  This could indicate that these are legit jobs.  Overall, I think this is probably a grey market for mercenary work, mostly private security.  Even if all jobs are completely legal, I could understand the need for secrecy, as I imagine people tend to carry grudges when you work these kinds of jobs, and I seriously doubt these people are paying taxes to boot."

In ROP's comment history, he makes a comment about being on both sides of Guerilla warfare. There are also references that he was involved in assasinations. That leads me to think special operations since those are the guys dealing with guerilla warfare. Also, 2-6 said ""I did'nt no so many people could like him that did'nt sling a gun with him."" This leads me to think its possible they served together in the military, especially because of the whole trained killer notion. Angel2-6, on fark, makes references to being involved in US wars.

Some jobs might be legit, others more murky.  RoP/Milo acts as a broker.  He sounds like he as worked as a merc all over the globe in the past.  I would guess he had connections with the major players in Intelligence and would act as a procurer for hired guns on occasion in addition to running a private security firm.  Maybe he did wet work, but I would imagine that it was at the behest of some governmental agency somewhere (CIA/Mossad).  One of the job posting mentions ""DP"" which, unless he was running a porn studio, probably stands for ""Diplomatic Protection"".  He clearly states that they have no work in the M/E ( Middle East).  The fact that they are looking for ""s or sbs"" experience would be Seal or Special Boat Service guys.  Probably anti- piracy contracts on ships.  Look, there are bad guys out there.

If you aren't home and the dog is outside they are known to open your gate and lead them to a van. Dog fighters want larger dogs. Puppies don't make good bait dogs. I would suggest asking around for any unusual solicitors. There is usually a pattern in a neighborhood with solicitation. For us, we get door to door steaks, ADT security and a lawn service. I would be suspect of any one off solicitor who doesn't have cards and a clear sales pitch. Any information you can gather will help with determining the next steps. I also recommend contacting a local pit bull rescue and ask about where the dog fighting hot spots are. They know because they are usually on the scene when police are involved with a raid to help with the dogs."

You would need a huge population boom practically overnight, and a history of attacks that were unsuccessful, and to explain why they were going in to yards as opposed to going after prey closer to their comfort zone, and why there wasn't blood/remains on the scene that would indicate a coy kill, and and and..."
RBI,2tw9xf,habitualbastard,-1,Wed Jan 28 16:30:54 2015 UTC,"I was half joking but you're wrong .

But from the scarce info out there, it doesn't seem to indicate bloody scene, noise, etc. (I know coyotes make quite a bit of noise and I imagine dogs would bark once it picked up coyote scent...?) I believe at least one, for sure was fenced in the backyard with owners home. I am trying to go through other ways to get more details.   I am sad to realize that in searching for past suspected dog-nappings, there were a few pretty disturbing discoveries in those cases. But that was in Canada, I believe. Mannitoba? Anyhow, I wondered what was ultimately identified as the culprit in those cases, but not too much to work with.   Here's a question, too. Would people who have been charged and sentenced for animal cruelty be in some kind of system for the public to know? Not to hunt ppl down, but to explore where those individuals live in reference to the Wise County areas. Just as a start?    Thanks."
RBI,2tw9xf,skottdam,1 point,Wed Jan 28 07:42:02 2015 UTC,It's a doggone mystery.  But you would think the sheriff would have looked for that already.

RBI,2tw9xf,sinenox,-1,Wed Jan 28 15:41:56 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking it isn't human theft simply because of the number is to large,for fighting dogs you want a specific breed at a certain weight and these type of dogs are not always easy to approach,unless you drug them which would be too much hassle and would leave the culprit exposed for too long. A big cat can hop a fence and drag a dog out so quick,coupled with the fact that it's winter and they want the easy meal"
RBI,2tw9xf,skottdam,2,Wed Jan 28 15:55:05 2015 UTC,"No way. First they're solitary hunters and they don't take that often, so you'd be looking at a huge puma population suddenly arriving in the area, that no one has seen, that's going in to fenced yards instead of taking easier prey, and leaving no blood or other signs at the scene.   It's definitely humans, and they're either taking them as bait dogs (unlikely given the breeds) or for resale on the market. There have been rashes of selective-breed (Great Dane, etc) thefts in the past in California and elsewhere. Nothing else explains the high numbers.   Edited to add: If you want to see similar, google ""rash of dognappings"". It sounds like a joke but sadly it isn't."

RBI,2tu75y,UltimateTurtleLover,12,Tue Jan 27 13:39:59 2015 UTC,So the story is my BRAND NEW car was vandalized by some little hell child and this was his or her shoe print. I'm pretty sure it was a kid because there's a few new kids around the block and there all horribly behaved and crazy. The shoe print looks to be like a size 8 or so. They ran up the back dented in the trunk ran on the roof and scratched it like crazy but didn't dent it in too bad because I have a sunroof for some extra bracing but I think it was a decently light kid too and then they jumped on my hood and crushed it in. And the best part is my car is silver so the new hood and trunk won't match unless the whole damn car is repainted! That's why I need to find what kind of shoe track this is. And yes I've contacted the police and they said your on your own obviously and its a little too late to install cameras and I'm not trying to magically solve it by finding the shoe but I've talked to every parent and they deny it of course so if I get a better idea of what kind of shoe it is and I see the neighbor kid walking down the road with them on I know who to go after.

What is the likelihood that she started the game and got upset when it got out of hand and told her parents she was being bullied?  Is it possible that the arguments on the phone that led to the voicemails were the father of the twins defending his children because Knudson's daughter started a game with them about it?  Should he have lost his job over what appears to be drunk voicemails after an argument?  In any case, I think this is a pretty clear case of the internet vigilantism plowing forward uncontrolled before the whole story came out.  Bradley Knudson 5 hours ago  I would like to thank everyone for their support. I just found out our daughter did not take this issue as seriously as Wendy and I. The n word is something I was taught at a very young age was not appropriate. You hear nowadays a lot of songs by People of all color use this word. You also see videos that they use this word. I have never liked it I've always thought it was inappropriate that they used it. I have now found out that my daughter during the WCCO interview decide...d to use Snapchat and send people videos of her thinking that this was a game and it was funny and she actually uses the N-word twice. Regardless of your skin color I and my wife do not tolerate this word our daughter is going to be reprimanded in an appropriate manner. I am extremely saddened and disappointed because of this video she has discredited the message that we wanted to convey. I hope that this does not stop our efforts to highlight the issues that still remain regarding bully and the effects it has on children. It is still truly an epidemic and social media has allowed us to bully individuals 24 hours a day seven days a week no matter where that person lives. Wendy and I are still dedicated to highlighting this issue and help educate our young people on the effects of bullying and how to deal with bullying.

If you or anyone else calls and asks about the case, this is how the conversation will go down:    Q: What's this about?  A: I'm trying to deliver a court summons.  Q: Yeah but what kind of court summons?  A: It's my job to deliver them, not read them. Are you related to him/her? Where do you live? Is she/he living at 123 Rainbow Road, Apt. Q still? Where does he/she work?   If you don't accept service at home, they will try to serve you at work and may even have a PI tail you so you can be served on the street.  Or, if you're not worth the time, they'll give up. But if you've gotten in any crashes / defaulted on any debt in the past 2 years, they'll probably try until they get it right.  BTW, if it is about you, and they try to serve you and can't, a lot of states allow them to publish in a newspaper of general circulation for a few months before proceeding ""in rem"" (legalese for: against your property). They'll get a default judgment and (again, states differ but usually they can) go after almost any property that you're not paying a mortgage/note on.  Also, if you avoid service, courts can force you to cover the costs of service.  It's a better idea to contact a lawyer, and ask them to search for recently filed cases naming you as a party near them if you want to know what it's about before you accept.

We could hear and talk to this third party but not the person we called, but the person we called could hear us both... REALLY FREAKY...   We finally figured out that a neighbor down the block would get us when he picked up the phone and that is who we were talking to. Somehow the lines got crossed...

Party line systems were widely used to provide telephone service, starting with the first commercial switchboards in 1878.  A majority of Bell System subscribers in the mid-20th century in the United States and Canada were serviced by party lines, which carried a billing discount over individual service; during wartime shortages, these were often the only available lines. British users similarly benefited from the party line discount. Farmers in rural Australia used party lines, where a single line spanned miles from the nearest town to one property and on to the next.

Since it's a non moving(vandalism) incident your rates are unlikely to increase and if they do it'll be like $20 a month.

RBI,2slgr6,RalphNLD,0,Mon Jan 19 05:36:28 2015 UTC,"No but I could think of a small number of scenarios where you could actually enhance an image, but those are rarely the case in situations like this. Examples would be: blurred images, images with twirls in them (a pedofile spreading child porn once twirld his profile picture; didn't take long before they simply twirled it in the opposite direction and ended up with a perfectly fine portrait), stills from interlaced videos and so on. But 9 out of 10 times images posted here are heavily compressed JPEGs form a dashcam or security cam. Of course when someone has a RAW image that could be 'enhanced' as well, but that's self explanatory."

RBI,2slgr6,Phreephorm,1 point,Fri Jan 16 17:30:24 2015 UTC,"Problem is video resolution doesn't compared to a photo resolution. 1080p is 1080x1920 pixels which is roughly 2mp. Photo cameras now are like 12mp average lol which gives you a lot more detail and size (Also depends on the sensor, lens and even lighting for detail and sharpness). RalphNLD, any positive editing of an image, video or photo, can be considered enhancing it lol i was just references the CSI or any crime movie/show cliche about enhancing a video resolution... You can not create resolution that does not exist. There are programs that allow you to create pixels to create a larger image. For example, if I take a photo but it can only print up to 8x10 before it looses quality, I can create pixels to make it larger BUT only by a little. The computer generates these pixels so you can develop what is called artifacts.. Which is not pleasant looking"

By the way, 1920 was after WWI so he could have very well served or been drafted right before the war ended since it went from 1914-1918 with the US only joining the war after the RMS Lusitania was sunk in 1915 with 128 Americans among the dead. President Wilson demanded an end to warfare on passenger ships which Germany complied with, however, Wilson did  warn Germany that the US wouldn't tolerate unrestricted sub warfare. The US entered WWI in 1917 after Germany resumed unrestricted U-Boat operations. You'll pretty much find a draft card for any and all able bodied individuals from 1917-1918 but that doesn't mean a single one was ever called to serve since the war was so short for US involvement.       It is very common to lose people between censuses if they move out of state or even as little as another county over.

A lot of people seem to have been involved in this, and someone will brag.   Also, regarding the picture on imgur, since you are concerned about retaliation, consider moving it to your Google Drive with the videos to lessen the chance that one of those criminals will stumble upon it and recognize the area."

RBI,2rvxmn,HelloPage,3,Tue Jan 20 02:00:18 2015 UTC,"My notes are too long to fit into one reply, so after I will split them into two. After you read this message, see my next reply.  Thanks! .....  Some basic observations: 1) This seems like organized crime.  2) In the video, I observed flashes of light at key points.  I lean toward suspecting the criminals of using light to communicate with one another.    At lot happens in the video, so I will use the time code to record my observations. Then, perhaps, coordinated events might stand out better.  I’m basing this on the First Angle, which is in color, and is labeled camera three:  Begin Observation: 10:18 p.m. Dark out and nearly everyone is wearing dark clothes, it appears.    You mentioned that you don’t want to reveal much about the location, which is probably a wise decision for the time being.  Just keep in mind that different locations attract different kinds of activity, so what is suspicious for one location could be ordinary for other locations. Context is everything.   At the start, two light-colored cars are in the parking lot. The closer one is backing up and pulling out, turning right. The further one has its headlights on but is in a parking space not moving. You’ve called that one a white car.  22.18.47 The car that turned right is leaving the screen just as someone is walking into the picture from that same spot. This person crosses the street and then walks on the sidewalk in the direction of your door. I lose track of this person at 22.19.34. To back up, when that same person was crossing the street, someone in the white parked car was getting out.   Regarding that person above who walked into the picture, I am unable to tell if this person briefly interacted with the person or people in the white parked car when he passed it.  22.19.02 White parked car turns its headlights off. This is just before the black car pulled into the parking lot. Those two events seem related. When the person got out of the white car, I watched the tape several times and I couldn’t be sure if I saw a second person with the car. That may have been the darkness of the interior contrasting with the white exterior. Also, a light appeared briefly in the back of the car, perhaps a trunk light (see 22:19:14).  The black car parked in the same lot but not near the white car. Neither car is parked near the better of the two cameras, and the light-colored car is parked just off screen of the camera you refer to as Angle two (the black and white camera with the wide-angle lens).   The person in the white car walks to the black car, and I think only one person got out of the black car (See next paragraph; I reexamine this and decide on three people). So the two people, one from each car, walk together for a moment. Then at  22.20.05 they split up. The person who headed right seems to meet another person at 22.20.11. I don’t know where this third person came from; he or she could have been parallel parked. The person who headed left seems to be white or if not white than not very dark or wearing a light colored hat. This person is also wearing light-colored shoes, running shoes, perhaps.  This person walks to a place on the sidewalk at 22.20.22, and this is the general location I will refer to as The Spot.  A few seconds earlier, at 22.20.11, I think maybe this person lifted an arm as if to wave to someone else. I made a mental note that the second video, which is shorter, begins a few seconds after this, so I checked it to see if I can see interaction. I can’t, so I return to the first video. After the waive, or whatever it was, the person walked a few more steps in the direction he/she waved, then turned around (22.20.25) to rejoin the other two people, and the three of them appear to rush around for a few seconds.  To back up a few seconds, I would later see someone holding a flashlight, and I so I’m looking for the first sign of that. Maybe at 22.20.16 one of two together shines a flashlight against a surface. I can’t be sure. The light could be coming from an off screen car.  22.20.06. Whereas I could count only two people the first few times I watched this, at this very spot I notice what could be a third person with them separating from the right (my right). This could account for the third person who appears in a few seconds. I backed up the video, and at 22.19.41 and 22.19.42 I can see what appears to be three heads against the darker interior of the car. As they walk, I have a hard time seeing the third person then I barely notice the third person separate.  22.20.24 I see you, OP, come out of your door, barely. As you said, the sign blocks you from view for a moment, and then as you appear on the sidewalk, someone walks by you, and I can't distinguish you from the others after this. When I watch the movement by your door for three seconds beginning with 22.20.31, I can make out four people. Soon, two will move left and one will move right, and I incorporate those movements into my comments below. The person who moved right has a flashlight.  When you exited the door, a shift in activity occurred soon after, which was a scramble then a general shift in movement away from your door. Movement picked up speed.  First I will comment about the movement toward the right of your door (my right), and then I’ll comment about the left side.  As I mentioned above, I can’t distinguish you from the others, but counting-wise I am short by one person and I think someone is out of view in your door area.  The Right Side  Observation 1, The Street Crossers:  At 22.20.42, two people appear at the top of the screen under the 2 in the 20. They cross the street and just before leaving the camera view, they pause at 22.21.08 and then appear to walk off camera at 22.21.14.  I do not know if they are related. Their appearance at 22.20.42 coincides with the person in observation 2 below shining the flashlight.  Observation 2: Here, I am watching the person who has the flashlight. You can notice the flashlight at 22.20.42, which is the same time stamp as above when I noticed two additional people further to the right. I see the flashlight person walk a few steps and I lose the light but I see someone’s movement under the 1 in the date stamp (22.20.55 to 22.20.59). Then, at 22.21.00 this person appears to shine the flashlight onto a surface, and after that another activity shift occurs.  When you read “The Left Side” below, I mention the light again (and I wrote that part first, so you’ll notice that I first question whether the light comes from a car), but I now believe it came from the flashlight.  See Part II"
RBI,2rvxmn,HelloPage,3,Tue Jan 20 01:54:25 2015 UTC,"Part II  The Left Side  This part of the observation begins around the time you exited your door (22.20.24): At that same time, 22.20.25, a car is waiting to turn right. It is waiting for a person to cross. By 22.20.33 the car turns and the walking person begins to appear on screen. Once this person finishes crossing the street, he waits in The Spot. As this person waits, the group of three mentioned earlier split up. Two of them turn around and walk past the guy standing in The Spot, but they don’t pass The Spot at exactly at the same time. The Spot Person appears to have interaction with the first person, after which the first person picked up speed and crossed the street, jaywalking. Then the second person passes the standing guy at The Spot (22.20.49), and at the moment The Spot’s standing guy  walks slightly right. He stays still for approximately 10 seconds. At 22.21.02, I see what I think is a head move against the light of your door, and the person who had been standing still near The Spot now begins moving (22.21.03) toward the person who passed your door. Coinciding with this (actually, two seconds prior), at 22.21.01 and 22.21.02, a light flashes against a surface just under the 4 in the date stamp. At first I think it’s a car light, but the next vehicle that drives by doesn’t create the same light, so I am making a note to watch that spot as more vehicles drive by. I already know that someone has a flashlight and I wonder if these people are signaling each other with light. (At this point, I watched this Flashlight Person more closely and wrote my observation above under ‘The Right Side”).  Another shift in movement occurs, beginning either with the light flash or the movement by your door (so, at 22.21.01 or 22.21.02), and now the overall movement is toward your door (or that general area of the screen). The tone of the movement shifts also, and by that I mean someone observing would notice odd behavior. At 22.21.12, someone runs onto the screen from the right. This person has white or light shoes. This person runs between two cars and then begins walking. This person crosses the street and disappears from view. (note: check other video). I will call this person Weird Runner.  Meanwhile, the person who had been standing at The Spot is still walking toward the Flashlight Person.    22.21.15 Flash Light Person is standing under the 2 and the 0 in the 2013 date stamp. In a few seconds, this person moves as others approach this general area.   22.21.20 The person who walked from The Spot now crosses under the 4 in the date stamp.   22.21.20 to 22.21.25: Under the date stamp, three people move around. I think this is the Flashlight Person and the person who walked from The Spot.  As for the third person, it could be either the head that appeared by your door at 22.21.02 (but in that case, I never saw that person relocate, so I lean toward thinking it was not this person), or else the third person could be the person from earlier in the time code (22.18.47) who crossed the street while the person in the white car was getting out of his/her car. I lean toward that but make a mental note to review the video looking just for that. Also, I may not have located all the people involved, so it could be yet another person. While these three people are together, I can’t tell if they switch positions. As this is happening, Weird Runner moved off screen.  The three people separate – one stays to the right with the flashlight and two walk left toward your door. They could have switched jobs, I can’t tell.   22.21.31 Of the above two people, one stopped near your door and the other kept walking, coming to a stop at The Spot. The person at The Spot stood there for a while. Meanwhile, the person near your door was not visible. Meanwhile, I still have not located the person whose head I saw near your door at 22.21.02.  22.21.38 Maybe I can see two heads moving in front of your door. This is in addition to the person who is walking to The Spot.  22.21.46 The person walking to The Spot arrives. THEN: 22.21.46 Flashlight Person shines the flashlight against a surface. Over the next few seconds, someone from the Flashlight spot walks all the way to the person at The Spot. At 22.22.07, the walking person nears the end of the building and then passes the building. The person seems to pause at 22.22.10 for a couple of seconds, and then another person appears from the right (note: maybe this is more clear on the other video), coming out of the blur at 22.22.13 and then moving back into the blur.  I stared at that blurry spot, ignoring the rest of the screen. Nothing more can be seen in this corner for the rest of the video. *** I checked the other video and the time code jumps from 22.22.14 to 22.22.57.  For a while, I don’t notice any movement. No cars drive by. I wonder if these people have blocked the road.   22.22.57 The person at The Spot who has been standing still moves right. At this same time, the first car in a while drives by. The person from The Spot walks to your door area and seems to stop there just as the video ends. I did not see any flashlight activity just prior to the 22.22.57 movement.  Rewatched and found this: Notice the van-like vehicle parked to the side of the white car. It seems to be in a parking lot across a street to the right of the white car. Anyway, at 22.19.18 as people are getting out of the black car, a light flashes in this van-like vehicle.  The light doesn’t repeat from traffic headlights. This is the same spot where later in the video the two people who crossed the street paused. I don’t know if it’s a van, btw.  End of observation. See below for more notes.  Thoughts I had as I went along, and some guesses:  This is timed perfectly. They knew exactly the minute you would appear.  I wonder if they dressed in similar clothes to confuse you as to who is who. Both cars parked in a way to allow them to see your house.  The white car parked by backing into the space. This would allow for observation and for a quicker exit. Also, use what you know about the case to consider why the trunk was seemingly opened and closed. Not knowing any of the context, I can't make smart guesses, but in some contexts, weapons could be a possibility. Or, if people are coordinating efforts, it could be a signal to someone else. The car lights turning off could have been a signal. Someone later has a flashlight, and that is another way to signal people. Could the flashlight have come from the trunk? Once the people mix together, I can't keep the people straight.  The Spot: Use what you know about the crime and location to consider if this spot could be a central communication spot. Is it easily visible? Is it a good lookout?   Regarding my own bias, when I looked at this, you had already told me you had been a crime victim relating to someone in the video, and the multiple people had been involved, so I looked at this trying to see who appears to be interacting. I do not know if the crime happens while the video is running. I can't make out a crime, but there are points when the activity seems to shift toward your door and away from your door, and at times activity speeds up and slows down. I am guessing the crime happened just in front of your door. I lost track of a person there. That’s not a question for you; it’s just part of my observation, and you don’t need to tell us.  The left side of the building (my left) is another spot that’s difficult to track, especially since the one video that shows that spot loses time in the time code (jumps forward at places).   The spot you referred to as your door appears to be a bright rectangle with some still, dark shapes on it. Just to the left of that door (so, my left as I am looking at the screen), is a dark line/figure. It stays in that spot throughout the video, mostly still, but sometimes the moves very slightly. I don't know if this is a person or an object, but I make a mental note of it. 22.18.47 to 22.18.52 is an example.  At 22.21.06, that car with its lights on – I can’t tell if it’s just waiting to turn, which it did, or if the driver had interaction with the flashlight person.   In the black and white video, I can see the person with the flashlight at 22.20.40 and for the next few seconds, but then the video jumps again and skips some time.  I am trying to search for information about criminals using light to communicate, just out of curiosity. If anyone finds creditable info, please post.   Editing Disclosures: I did this in several sittings, sometimes typing as I went along and sometimes in reflection, and naturally my tenses shifted. I’m not going to worry about cleaning that up.  Finally, if it seems like I accidentally reversed left and right or reversed numbers, ask me. I tried not to, but I know my common errors. I do know right from left, so if that happened, I’ll just fix it and update.  I’m not going to sit on this until it’s all polished and pretty, but I don’t want to add to confusion either. :)  OP -- Good luck to you. I hope you are in a situation where you can get far, far away from these people. Edited to insert spaces between the lines.  Edited to add: See my edits in the reply below.  I'm reaching max character count."
RBI,2rvxmn,HelloPage,2,Tue Jan 20 01:56:22 2015 UTC,"Edits to add to the above posts: At 22.22.22, I see something (a light?, movement?) in what I'm calling the van, and no traffic or headlights were around. Also, upon rewatching, this ""van"" seemed to have a lot of light activity near the beginning of the video. From 22.19.00 to 22.19.14 when the white car showed that trunk light (or whatever it was), the ""van"" has a lot of light movement. At a spot on the 22.19.15 mark, the person from the white car seems to have a flashlight, and I wonder if some of the van's lights could have been a reflection from this flashlight. But then the ""van"" has light action again at 22.19.47 through 22.19.49, which I cannot explain away as a reflection. The lights I mentioned as coming from the van at 22.19.18 (in the above section titled ""Rewatched and found this"") could have been caused by the black car's breaks. I think I had noted that time code and but then intended to actually use a later time code when I wrote ""Rewatched and found this."" ...  Jumping around a bit to the person on the right-hand section of the sidewalk with the flashlight  around the 22.21.00 mark and for the next few seconds, I cannot tell if the light shining on the is coming from the car or the flashlight.  My conclusion for now is that some of the light movement in the video is obviously traffic, but other light movement seems to be intentionally caused by the people.  I'm sure the police gave you resources.  If you need more, here are two:  http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/stalking-resource-center,  and  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.magick.moderated/iw2JROOShrY . This last one touches on the topic of group stalking, and after googling that topic a bit, I would suggest sticking with really mainstream help sources if you look into this concept or you risk getting sucked into ""helpful"" resources that have more of an extremist-sounding edge."
RBI,2rvxmn,HelloPage,3,Tue Jan 20 08:09:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply. That is a very detailed response. I will comment on what you wrote and point out a few other things.  “This seems like organized crime.” Yes, I completely agree, it was very well conspired, coordinated, and organized.  22.18.47. The first car leaving is a taxi, with a light on top. “this person at 22.19.34” has nothing to do with the assault event, and didn’t interact with anyone, but it’s useful to notice this person because of the obvious contrast between a coincidental person who happened to be around, and the obvious other people who are clearly involved. It’s also worth noting that there aren’t a lot of people in this neighbourhood walking around. These video cameras were on a restaurant / bar. The bar was obviously closed this night (even at 10:18 to 10:23pm), and therefore no one was around. A car parked with its headlights on (meaning it might be running and ready to leave at a moment’s notice) in an empty parking lot of a closed business, is suspicious. It had no legitimate reason to be there. Same thing with the black vehicle which arrived later.  You referred to “the black car”. This is actually a black Acura MDX SUV. I previously asked about this in this thread in r/Cars.  Only one person got out of the white car. The light at the back of the car was just due to the driver locking it, I believe. Only one person got out of the black SUV.  “The person who headed right seems to meet another person at 22.20.11. I don’t know where this third person came from.” You’re right about this third person, who “seems” to appear out of nowhere. I thought at first this was a shadow, but there’s no light source that would cause a shadow there. Do you want to take another look and see if you can tell where he came from, or do you want me to spoil the surprise for you? :) It’s kind of amazing when you realize where he came from.  “The person who headed left”, I believe, was wearing a white hoodie, which makes him distinguishable in the video. Bonus points for seeing the “light-colored shoes”.  “I can’t distinguish you from the others”. I am one of the two moving left (“two will move left and one will move right”). I am the one furthest left, moving the fastest, then being followed by the figure with the white hoodie. He starts running after me at 22:20:52.  I think “The Street Crossers” are uninvolved (although they do seem to walk quickly after the guy shines his flashlight, as you noticed), but that’s a useful observation to compare the uninvolved with the involved.  ""someone’s movement under the 1 in the date stamp"". This is the same figure with the flashlight.  “The Spot Person appears to have interaction with the first person, after which the first person picked up speed and crossed the street, jaywalking.” There was no interaction, but “The Spot Person” did react as I (“the first person”) walked by him. I didn’t notice this person that night, only after I watched the video. The fact he reacts as I walk by him indicates he was involved in this event.  “the second person passes the standing guy at The Spot (22.20.49), and at the moment The Spot’s standing guy walks slightly right.” This also shows that “The Spot’s standing guy” was clearly involved (“the second person” is the attacker with the white hoodie, who attacked me offscreen).  “at 22.21.01 and 22.21.02, a light flashes against a surface just under the 4 in the date stamp”. This is just a reflection (on one of the building’s windows) of the lights of car that you noticed at that time. You can see the same reflecting at 22:20:15 and 22:21:25, for example.  “At 22.21.12, someone runs onto the screen from the right.” I know you meant “the left” here. This was the attacker, with the white hoodie and white shoes, who started running after me at 22:20:52 and who left the left side of the image at 22:20:56.  “Under the date stamp, three people move around.” You are right that two of those are “the Flashlight Person and the person who walked from The Spot”. I’m pretty sure the third one is uninvolved in this event, just based on watching the other two.  “The person at The Spot stood there for a while. Meanwhile, the person near your door was not visible.” I’m pretty sure “the person near your door” is that third uninvolved person, and just went inside the building.  “another person appears from the right [...] coming out of the blur at 22.22.13”. The other person (you meant ""appears from the left"") is me. I was trying to get help from that man who stopped there. He refused to get off his phone. I then walked back into “the blur” and this man followed me.  “the van-like vehicle parked to the side of the white car. It seems to be in a parking lot across a street to the right of the white car”. I’m quite certain only the white car and the black SUV are involved in this event.  “This is timed perfectly. They knew exactly the minute you would appear. I wonder if they dressed in similar clothes to confuse you as to who is who. Both cars parked in a way to allow them to see your house.” I totally agree with “timed perfectly. They knew exactly the minute you would appear” and “Both cars parked in a way to allow them to see your house.” I am certain the attacker in the white car was watching and could see when the light in my window in the building went off. I wouldn’t be surprised if he was watching with binoculars. I am also certain he then called the SUV driver to the scene. I think your point about “dressed in similar clothes” is too difficult for me to tell.  “The white car parked by backing into the space. This would allow for observation and for a quicker exit.” I agree completely. However, I don’t think “the trunk was seemingly opened and closed”. The attacker didn’t use any weapons.  “I do not know if the crime happens while the video is running.” The attack happened (barely) offscreen to the left between 22:20:56 and 22:21:12. As you noticed, the figure at “The Spot” started moving away during this time at 22:21:04. “I am guessing the crime happened just in front of your door.” I can understand this mistake, since it’s very vague and ambiguous, and the attack was offscreen.  “At 22.21.06, that car with its lights on – I can’t tell if it’s just waiting to turn”. I’m sure it was just waiting to turn, with the oncoming cars.  “this ‘van’ seemed to have a lot of light activity”. I’m pretty sure the lighting in this area is just reflection from vehicles in the area, some direct and some indirect. From “22.19.47 through 22.19.49”, you can see headlights at the left of the screen which look like they are from a vehicle exiting this parking lot offscreen and then turning left. I think you’re seeing those lights reflected around the right of the screen.  You mention that ""the time code (jumps forward at places)"" in the second video. That's true. It skips in three places. The video was edited. I asked about this in this thread in r/VideoEditing.  I appreciate the time you took to look at this. The only things which I would still be interested in hearing your comments about would be: A second look at where you think the figure seems to appear out of nowhere at 22:20:18 came from; and is there anything notable about the figure who gets out of the black SUV at 22:19:39? Where does this figure go?"
RBI,2rvxmn,HelloPage,1 point,Tue Jan 20 20:05:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Yes, I now see that what I thought was the white car's trunk opening and closing is probably the interior light flashing as the door locks.  I'm glad fewer people were involved than it seemed in my observation. And good that you found my left/right switches!  I would guess that the Suddenly Appearing Person came from a car, but the person's exit from the vehicle was cut from the video.  The time code is off for this video too. There is an obvious blip at 22.18.52 and a blur at 22.20.00. I set my timer as the video started, and after a short while my timer was several seconds ahead.  I think maybe a blur filter has been applied in spots, but I would have to review other closed system videos to get a better idea of quality.   Regarding  notable qualities about the person getting out of the car:  - The video skips microseconds at points. - At 22.19.38, the video shifts/skips/overlaps or something. - The attacker might have opened the car door. I'm not clear, but I lean toward that. This person could have come from the back seat.  I wonder if more people are in the car.  The person is slow to get out, and the slowness could be caused by the Attacker talking with others.  - The attacker seems alpha, maybe helping this person from the car. Getting this person out of the car seems like a production.  - 22.19.50 the Attacker takes a bigger than usual step or bends his knees slightly as if to hoist something, but I don't see anything hoisted.  This person appears shorter than the attacker. Maybe the big production with getting out of the car was this person stepping down from the high-off-the-ground SUV.  - They appeared to be carrying something, but that perspective changed without them setting anything down. Then I wonder if they were holding hands. Not sure. 22.19.53 is where I wondered that.  As for your question about where the black SUV person went: The skips in the black and white video prevent me from tracking individuals well from that angle.  For the First Angle, in color, at 22.20.47, while the attacker is chasing you, someone is in your door area and someone else is heading the other way with a flashlight. This person could be either of the two.   If this is a critical part, I can download the video and watch it zoomed in and slowed down. Let me know. Otherwise, I wouldn't typically automatically download someone else's video.  Someone in one of the forensics subreddits might be able to add thoughts to the video editing.   When you get justice eventually, be sure to update here!"
RBI,2rvxmn,HelloPage,1 point,Wed Jan 21 03:37:04 2015 UTC,"About the “Suddenly Appearing Person” and “where the black SUV person went”, I’d be interested in seeing if you can determine specifically where the first one came from, and where the second one goes. I know those answers, but I wanted to see if you could tell by watching, especially since you were looking really closely for details.  I’ll give a hint: if you look at the B&W second angle video, you will find the answers to those questions. I guarantee if you use the VLC player and rotate the image so that the sidewalk is horizontal, you will see what I’m talking about. Even though the first two minutes of the second angle are missing, if you look closely you can tell these figures’ positions. So if you have a bit more time, could you download the videos and take a look?  “The attacker might have opened the car door.” I agree, this is correct.  “I wonder if more people are in the car.” No, there is only one person from each of the white car and the black SUV.  “This person appears shorter than the attacker.” I appreciate that you made this observation, because I think most people wouldn’t notice this, which I agree with.  “They appeared to be carrying something”. To be specific, it looks to me like the SUV driver is carrying a noticeable white object.  “I wonder if they were holding hands.” That’s an interesting observation.  Would you say that these details make it more likely that the SUV driver was female?"
RBI,2rvxmn,HelloPage,1 point,Wed Jan 21 07:03:44 2015 UTC,"If I had to place a bet one way or the other, I would say the person from the black SUV is female. The white object this person had in the car is probably what I thought was another head. Anyway, I would guess this person is female because she takes a more stereotypical female role. She may have confronted you in the doorway, but then she gets out of the way and has a male fight for her. Also, if the object she has was the flashlight, she handed it to the Attacker, and let him hand it to the third person who walked away with it shining on the ground.  Everything is distorted because of the wide angle lens. If there are stairs exiting your door, it appears as a flat white surface. Something is in the door way, and sometimes people are behind it so that I can see just their heads. Sometimes they move in front of the surface, and I can see the full figure.This might be the billboard you mentioned.  In the colored First Angle, I can see the 'Appeared From Nowhere"" Person at 22.20.17. This person stands on one side of the doorway exit area, my left side. From the black and white Second Angle, I see that he comes from your building. I think the building must have multiple doors, because he comes from an area further to the left (my left) than you did. I cannot see the actual doors. I think the doors are glass.  Meanwhile, the other person, the Possible Female from the SUV, stands on the other side of the doorway or stairs or general exit area. They are in this position at 22.20.22.  At 22.20.24, when you exited your door, the Possible Female moved in your direction. This person goes into your building, and I can see this person's head moving in some frames up until 22.20.44. This person seems to stay in your building.   I hope that helps!"

You can narrow it down to city.  Or in a big city, maybe a part of the city.  The only entity who has enough up-to-date info to link that IP address to a physical address is the ISP.

RBI,2roa1w,Hungryforeats,16,Wed Jan 7 22:01:45 2015 UTC,"Hunt a baited field. Have her put up a post on Facebook with a link to a self-hosted site. Maybe even put some interesting but false information on said site--make it interesting enough and the unknown person will be likely to click. You'll be able to see the IP addresses that accessed the site.   Also, is there any pattern to the dates and times the photos were taken? For example, if the unknown party sends a photo of her that was taken on a Wednesday morning several times in a row, you'd be able to tell that A) he/she isn't doing anything else on Wednesday mornings, and B) if you keep your eyes open on Wednesday mornings, you might spot somebody or something interesting.   You mention that the unknown party has some very specific information. Work backwards, and figure out who all has access to the information. Make a list. Don't exclude anybody. If you can get it to a relatively short list, plant some unique false details with the people on the list, and see if any of those details show up in a message--from there, you can either figure out who it is or where your leak is.   Don't discuss any countermeasures you may take with anybody--not family, not friends. If it's one of them, you're tipping your hand. Keep in mind, there is a possibility that it could be one of the family members or friends who claims to have received some of the abusive messages. Also, keep in mind that if your response is too abrupt or severe, the unknown party might realize you're trying to figure out who it is. That might cause him or her to go away temporarily, but it won't solve the underlying problem. Outwardly maintain business as usual.   Finally, if you are in a place where it's legal, get a gun. Otherwise, get some other defensive weapon--pepper spray, stun gun, big fucking stick, something. Always have it at home, and if it's legal, have her carry it with her when she's out. Obviously, get some training in the safe use of whatever you get.   This seems overly cloak and dagger, but without help from the police or Facebook, you're kind of on your own."

While your taxes may pay the cops salaries, you are not paying them to treat FB like a dog with a bone. That job is relegated to Lawyers who are being paid for that exact purpose.  The techie crap you are looking for from FB is the IP address of the accounts she has been messaged from. There should be a pattern there. Have someone who knows IP techspeak trace the IP to a subnet. This will be tied to a domain being administered by an internet provider.  NOTE: Be fully prepared for the level of harassment that includes spy pics to either be using some sort of IP mask like a VPN or TOR or just some bogus anonymizer. But something else you need to be aware of is... they could be using free wifi from damned near anywhere and you not find a pattern, a subnet mask, an administered domain or anything.  To next thing to consider, which I am sure you have racked your brains over already, is suspects. Suspects come in all shapes and sizes. Old flames, exes, crushes, and psycho friends of friends, clerks she encounters regularly, customers of hers she deals with, and as fucked up as it is to say this... some fucking kid in the neighborhood who knows just enough to terrorize her with pictures he makes when she isn't looking and details he learns from just watching out his window at her day to day activities. These kids are horrible because they get off on the power trip without a conscience   Also think about the girlfriend that just got dumped by the guy she used to date.

There is too many possibilities to narrow down for why they would do this, unless you can find more clues or even a new lead. Think about when it started, before it started, and what was different between the two times. Also think about, or list, the messages. Details. Not the details that give away identities, keep that secret, but anything not identifying could point rbi in the direction of a motive, and could lead to us interpreting a clue that gives you the answer.

This could be a new or old development, but you and your partner could try to think of things that may have happened around the time the harassment started. Even if it's something that's seemingly trivial, it may not be to the harasser.  Something you and or your partner could try with Facebook is instead of using your full real name, use a shortened one or have one or the other a fun word. For example, Jane Doe might be Wildchild Jane. Take/use a new picture to use with that account, as reverse image searching is definitely well within Google's reach.  I took a few courses in criminal psychology, but am by no means an expert.   Some common things in stalking:   Jealousy of varying degrees and types A need for control over others If romantically-related, they could equate love with possession and ownership Many (though not all) suffer from personality disorders, or at least have the traits of one or more   If you're wondering just how someone can do this, the online world provides the abuser with a sense of anonymity and a place to get rid of aggression with fewer perceived consequences.

In 1995, an unidentified young man, presumed to be a hitchhiker, was killed in a car accident that also took the life of the driver. The unidentified young man had no identification on him. He was wearing a Grateful Dead shirt and a note addressed to Jason was found near his body. Therefore he has been referred to as both Grateful Doe and Jason Doe.  The case has remained pretty cold for almost twenty years. However, recently redditor /u/greymetal posted an image on imgur asking for help identifying Grateful Doe.  An imgur user replied that he lost contact with a young man named Jason around that same time. Jason was a Grateful Dead fan and the photos provided by the imgur user bear a striking resemblance to Grateful Doe.  Unfortunately, the imgur user could not remember Jason's last name. Right now, we are looking for anyone who might be able to identify Jason so that we can establish whether or not he is Grateful Doe.

When I finally got my copies sent I made over three dozen, and I kept one anchored at the nearest VA office I happened to have close-by as soon as I got it; they told me then (2005) that their office will always have a copy if I needed it that badly; they made it seem like it's still a hell of red-tape and hurdles, but nowhere near what I'd have to do if I needed them to get my originals out of the 'vault' (which they told me at discharge almost always takes the minimum 6 month window to retrieve)."

RBI,2qq4gz,rag3kage,11,Mon Dec 29 17:19:57 2014 UTC,"Update: They are using tracking dogs right now to see if they can find anything. The police think he is still in the area.   Background (since many people seem curious): I met Ken over the summer and we started to hang out, he told me he was single but that he was more into open relationships and that he lets his partner(s) know if he is interested in anyone else. I thought nothing would really come of our relationship because I was moving to Chicago for graduate school, then he decided to start visiting me shortly after I moved there (about every other week), aside from that we Skyped every day, played video games, ect.  I knew he had bad experiences from when he was in the Air Force (he was special operations), but he told me he had come to term with the things he had to do. He had told me that prior to our dating/hanging out he was in a bad place, and that in his last relationship (while he was in the Air Force) it didn't help at all, he was really unhappy. However, at the same time he told me I helped make him feel like a better person, and that seemed to be true according to his friends. Only one time have I seen him break down over it, and it was at a Halloween party where he got fairly intoxicated.   Before Thanksgiving I noticed that the quality of our relationship seemed to be declining, I would ask him if anything was bothering him, and he would usually say he just wasn't feeling himself or that things were fine. I would ask him if he wanted to talk about it, and the answer was always no, so I didn't push. Other times I would ask him if he was interested in someone else or if he wanted to see someone else, and he would always say I would tell you if something like that were going on (he's extremely open about talking about this subject so I figured he was telling the truth).   Fast forward to winter break: he picked me up from Chicago, and I stayed the week before Christmas at his place. While I was there, things seemed fine, we talked normally, played a shit ton of Kerbal Space Program, there was only one thing that I noticed different, this girl A kept popping up, I just would notice her name a lot either on his computer on Skype or when he would respond to text messages. I asked him who she was, he said she was an ex-girlfriend, and for a moment was slightly defensive in saying that he always talked to his exes (which I knew was true so it didn't make much sense for him to be defensive). Later while using his laptop I noticed a tab for engagement rings (I knew that he had this computer for a while and he mentioned that this last girlfriend liked to save a lot of tabs), so I just inquired if they had thought about getting engaged at some point, and he said he didn't know why those would be on there. I am only bringing this up because since he's actually married to A, he passed two opportunities to tell me.   The following weekend, I was invited up to his place. We were to go to a class reunion bar crawl type of thing and I met them up at the first bar. I had been up there the previous weekend and his response to me was the same, he was really elated to see me. He greeted me with hugs and kisses, and his attention pretty much stayed on me for a while. Things seemed like they were perfectly fine. We moved to the next bar right down the street (the Hotel where he went missing from). He had made a comment to one of his friends about getting odd looks because of his outfit (vest over a button down and a bow tie, not something people usually wear up there) on the way over to the Hotel. When we all got there, he was rather chatty with some of the other guys with his best friend. At some point he did choose to stop drinking and I thought he could use a breather so I asked him to come outside with me. We went outside of the bar, we kissed, he seemed happy to be with me, and then we walked down the street just a few doors down and that's when he switched moods. We were outside of a bank and he started telling me about how it would be going into financial ruin, and it didn't make much since why he would suddenly get like this. I was trying to get him to tell me the point and he didn't seem to have one. I tried to get him to come back in the bar with me, but he didn't want to, so I went to grab his best friend to see if he could talk to him. In the time it took for his best friend to go outside (he went out immediately), Ken was gone. I was told he wasn't there, so I went out looking for him. We've been looking for him ever since. Needless to say, I feel a tremendous amount of guilt about this, I shouldn't have left him alone.  During the first night of searching, his best friend told me we should check out his wife's (ex girlfriend A) place. This was the first time I had heard of her. When best friend and all the other people that were in our group found out that I was in the dark, they told me that he had ended things a while ago but was still in the process of trying to get a divorce (it was messy apparently). According to A, they were working things out. So I am not sure where the truth lies. I don't know how much this has to do with what has happened. It is possible that things were too much for him to handle so he had to get away, but I don't see this as being something he would kill himself over. However, I am uncertain of how much he was actually struggling with his experiences in the Air Force.   At this point, the only thing I care about is finding him safely, that is the only priority in my mind. I really hope something is found today that can lead us to his whereabouts."

The town is pretty small, and I'm certain he knows a lot of people that live close by. As far as buses go I don't know where they would be located or if they even run through there. I believe there is a train station in Pontiac, MI, Bay City, MI and Flint, MI which would probably be the closest places. I'm not familiar with the area, but there are parks and lots and lots of woods around.  There has been a 10 mile radial search with hundreds of people through a professional search and rescue team from his last known location, and so far literally nothing has been found, not by a dog or a person.

When he went missing he was talking to me outside of the Hotel Bar in Otisville, MI, he seemed to be in an odd mood and got on a weird tangent about a bank, I couldn't get him to come inside so I went to grab his friend that was inside, he was gone within 2-5 minutes. He was visiting his family for the holiday break, he is between semesters right now. Everyone we can get in contact with in the area has been notified since he grew up in the Millington area.   He could be under some stress right now and just needed to escape everything. I just found out that he is dealing with getting out of a convenience marriage from when he was in the Air Force (I didn't know about this until the night he went missing), and that it was been difficult. This could easily have a lot to do with it. I honestly don't think that he would do harm to himself, he's too logical and cares too much about his mom to do something like that."

I'm wondering if it reflects what he's going through, i.e. if it's in the last week or so.  Is he impulsive? Apart from the bar, would any other establishments be open in the area around that time?   The holidays are a stressful time of year for a lot of people. You said he's between semesters; does mean he just finished exams?  Also, from personal experience, no one is ""too logical"" for the unthinkable to happen. Mental illnesses are invisible- it's hard to tell just from looking at someone if they suffer from one."

The fact that I might decide to take myself out one day is terrifying.  edit: That said, I'm 'too logical' to purposely do significant damage to myself.

Each state is different as to if the baby's mother (assuming unmarried since you didn't say wife/exwife) has sole legal custody or not. Most are leaning towards if you're on the birth certificate then legal is 50/50 with one parent being the custodial (residential) address. This doesn't mean the one with residential has the right to take the child and hide them. That is where parental kidnapping comes into play.

There's not going to be any new evidence found in relation to this, and there is such little evidence to go on.  The only chance of reddit finding his identity is someone going ""Oh god, Nick!

Both are possible, technically, but one is expensive.   Without permission requires a lot of pretty expensive equipment and a lot of pretty specific training. The sort of folks who invest in that kind of gear are the sort of folks who go to MIT, learned Morse for fun, and have antennas with loads of wires in boxes in their garage.   Basically cell phones are little radios. And cell phone towers are radio repeater towers. You'd need to be someone who has a spectrum analyzer and possibly a packet analyzer - I know there are programs that can be run on a laptop to do those chores, but you still need an antenna you can move around, and you'd need the cell phone to be on and sending data, and I have no idea if modern cell phone signals are encrypted in any way or not so I don't know how easy it would be to get a unique ID off the phone. I know the towers do it - but they're supposed to.   With permission is a lot easier. You put an app on the phone and then you go to a laptop, sign into the app, and tell it to find your phone. The phone does its GPS thing and sends the data to the app, which displays it for you on your computer. Works as long as the phone is powered on."

RBI,2qjogt,Reno-Dakota,1 point,Sun Dec 28 06:47:53 2014 UTC,"It's not the sensitivity of the spec any that's the issue, it's the gain on the antennas. Cell tower antennas aren't massive and cell phones give off what, 500mW? You can track that, but I was thinking in terms of needing to be close. I wasn't thinking in terms of setting up stationary monitoring locations - Very few private individuals would be able to set up the necessary number of stationary receivers of sufficient sensitivity to track a cell phone through even a small portion of a city. Never mind leaving the city. But a basic rig would fit in a van and if you were near enough, you could follow the signal based on srelative strength. You're still talking stupid expensive and time consuming. Like, one guy driving, one calling out directions. They would likely not be inconspicuous either since you'd need a couple antennas and... You know what? Fuck it, it's doomed to failure anyways given rf propagation through anyplace with metal is crazy confusing."
RBI,2qjogt,bookwench,6,Sun Dec 28 17:00:50 2014 UTC,"Yes, it's a real thing, and this is part of the E-911 system. No, normal people can't do it. You're going to have to be either a cell provider, someone with access to cell tower data, or have a significant amount of equipment and know-how.  Triangulation itself is easy... You just need to have 3 or more receiver sites at different locations, each of which can calculate an expected distance of the transmitter (ie the cell phone) based on its signal strength. You then mark those sites on a map and draw a circle around each one, the radius of which is the receiver site's calculated distance from the transmitter... Where those 3 circles cross is your transmitter's location.   That's the textbook ideal case, but it's still very possible to interpret a location even if you can't exactly calculate the distances from the signal strengths, or if you only have one receiver but it's sufficiently mobile (which may even be a benefit, but is complicated if the transmitter is moving). Heck, even with just two receiver sites, you can potentially narrow it down to two possible locations.  The real difficulty in the case of a cell phone is that it's much more tricky to isolate just one individual phone's intermittent transmissions from all of the traffic, unless you're the one who owns the cell tower or otherwise has access to its data. Definitely possible for law enforcement, or a 3-letter government agency, but it's probably easier for them to just query the phone's GPS chip at that point anyway."
RBI,2qjogt,WestonP,2,Tue Dec 30 01:27:28 2014 UTC,It is a real thing but requires highly technical data and logs from cell tower equipment. Such data and logs are far from being privy to the public.

I just watched the mentioned presentation given in Hamburg this evening, it should be online shortly for you to watch.  The gist of the problem is that the backbone (SS7) of the phone network does not do any authentication or encryption.  I did a quick search online for any tools and stuff I could play with for myself, but was unable to find it. I'll give it a week, after a few workshops in Hamburg this weekend, then it should be easier to find.

Historical societies in the area might have documentation of colorful events like this as an example of the desperation seen during the turbulent years within the Great Depression - even Universities within the state that teach a state history specific course might use it as an example of how people took matters into their own hands for it.     Newspaper Archive - if I remember correctly, this one allows you to search front pages for free. I had a subscription at one time and used it for both Genealogy and my degree - covers pretty much a wide spread range of years. Search both regional and local papers. Library of Congress Chronicling America project - currently from 1836-1922 but they are adding more years as the project expands. It might give you a starting point to find your grandfather if he made news in the area before the incident. Kinda to confirm it was in fact in the Rockwall, TX area.

The picture is of a ribbon which could be issued with a medal or in place of one. During WWI, many American military personnel were also allowed to wear medals, decorations, and awards presented by foreign governments.       Big Wikipedia listing of most awards and decs allowed for US Armed Forces. It does include obsolete items too so not quite sure where it falls but the ribbon itself is new enough to come wrapped in plastic or was able to be purchased when they were plastic wrapped.

This is what you should do: From your dads birth certificate you can find her DOB (or at least it should be on there, along with where she was born) using that information you can order her birth certificate, it will probably cost about $20. You can do the same for her death certificate, they can search multiple years since you aren't sure of the year. Her birth certificate will tell you the names of her parents, which should really help your genealogy search. As for a picture, year books will probably be your best bet, although there may also be one in a local newspaper from when she graduated, got married, and/or from her obituary."

Don't get me wrong, your friend's friend or whatever came up with a great idea, and its awesome it worked. But average police lack the skills and time to put something like that together.  In the end, the cops helped your buddy out and even dropped the laptop off to him.  Why didn't your friend go to the house himself to get the laptop?  Why did he feel the need to call the police for that? Cause it sounds like the police did at least some of the leg work, and went above and beyond to bring it to your friend.  Usually someone has to set up an appointment with an evidence custodian and come to the department to get property back.  The cops also could have kept the laptop as evidence of the crime.

I posted with a piss poor client app and could not find any easy to add info to the pics.  The Jeep is actually my father's and the  keying happened a while ago, shortly after he bought it. Both of us were stumped as to the symbol.     I am of the mind that it was not some random incident or meaningless symbol due to the fact that the jeep was not readily available at the time of the keying.  To get to his house, one would have to drive into the middle of no man's land where nothing else is close and then to get to the jeep, one would have to take a long driveway. Nothing that could be spotted driving by so an individual would have to already know the house location and where the jeep was.     The next place my mind went was motivation.  After a few discussions amongst the family, no one had any enemies or had been in any kind of altercations. They are a sweet group of people and kind on all fronts. Go out of their way to make sure everyone is okay and avoid arguments when peaceful solutions are possible.

Tell them to do it right away and upload it to youtube or any well-known video place.  Not still pictures. Not a 6-second clip. Not indoors. You need a full 60-second video showing the dog and the main street (which should probably have snow on it in PA) and recognizable stores.  If they are legit, you'll get a video right back.

It doesn't need to be repaired it need to be rebuilt.    That being said as the top reply here mentions get a lawyer and look at the lease.  That is correct.  Landlord/Tenant laws are very local.  What is legal in one area can be completely illegal in another.  Some laws are set at the state level, some at the county and some at the town/city.  A lawyer will know if there is anything in the law that would help.  The other piece to consider is the lease.  Most standard leases in the US contain a habitability clause.  This requires that the place you are renting be livable.  If the place becomes unlivable then the lease gets voided.  If this place really needs to be torn down then it is unlivable.  These habitability clauses are there to protect both the tenant and the landlord.  The landlord can't keep charging you rent saying ""Pay me, you got a lease"".  the tenant can walk away and use the money they had for rent on another rental.  Since they had a professional state that this is what is required then they have the proof needed regarding habitability and , thus, their next course of action is open.  Now I am going to be very frank here.  Your friend sounds a bit off.  All your friend needs to do is go rent another place.  No one is forcing him/her to be homeless or live out of their car.  Their lease is null.  The money they used to pay the landlord with the mold house can now be used to pay a new landlord for a new place.     Pay for our damaged stuff,   That's exactly what renter's insurance is for.  If the landlord is culpable the insurance company will go after him/her with the fury of a thousand suns.  If the landlord isn't then they will still pay for the damaged items (unless they think the tenant has somehow caused the problem)."

This leaves the onus of contacting you upon him. If he does not call, do not reach out to him. He likely has his reasons for not replying.   Do not call him. Do not find out where he lives and go there. Do not assume that he wants a relationship, or even if he does, that his family wants a relationship with you.   He did not sit in stasis for the past 36 years, he's got a life, and those people who he knows are going to be more important to him than you, a stranger.  I was contacted by my birth mother's family and informed that my birth father did not know i existed. Someone eventually told him. It took 3 years for someone in his family to reach out to me... and even then it's been very very distant, and I've only really talked to a half sister, and not him. I respect that.   My birth mother's family wants nothing to do with me, after THEY contacted ME! I have not heard from them in 5 years. This is because my half brother's wife hates me because she hates people who are adopted. Also, I'm ""too rich"" and ""too educated"". (no, I don't know what any of that means)  Basically what I'm saying is that people who know their parents sometimes forget that it's OK to not know.

RBI,2ng2t3,tjen,3,Sun Dec 7 22:42:27 2014 UTC,"Step 1 is to look at the inscriptions (other than the name) in the ring. It will most likely have a stamp indicating the specific jeweler who made it, as well as other details.   Depending on the contents of the stamp you may be able to narrow it down to a country, otherwise you may have to do some serious googling for different countries where you think it may be from's jeweler registers.   Here is a list of assayers' office stamps by country:   http://www.gold-traders.co.uk/hallmarks/  Not all countries use them though.   If you are able to identify the jeweler who made it by the stamp, then you can go on and contact them, tell them you have found a ring they made, for a wedding on that date, and if they have any records of who bought it, could they please contact those people and forward your contact details to them, as you have found their ring.   The name Jessica, the International date ordering, and that it was found in playa del carmen makes me think it's probably a UK ring, lol, but that's just a wildly stereotyping guess."

RBI,2ngled,copper_rainbows,2,Wed Nov 26 07:57:30 2014 UTC,"I was going to suggest you file a police report which you did. When I take reports, I am amazed at the number of people that do not have the serial numbers of their expensive items. If you do, make sure you provide them to the PD. A lot of our stolen items end up in local pawn shops and it gets tough when a victim sees his item, that looks like thousands of others, in a display case and he does not know the serial number.   Also, as more as a preventive for other readers, things that do not have a serial number and are unique you can take photos of. This is a tremendous help with the investigation of stolen material. One more preventive tip: lock your vehicles at all times and keep everything in them out of sight. A lot of out MV B&E'rs just walk down a street pulling on car door handles till they get the ones that are open. If they get a locked one that looks to have bags or backpack in them, they'll smash the window."

So might not be anything more than reused maps, although I'm no expert and this is probable the most boring theory here so I kinda hope I'm wrong...  Is there any more torn parts you can maybe look at? like torn corners and edges of the covers, do you see any ink there?

It definitely fits the subject matter though because Martinsburg, WV was basically the civil wars bitch.   The city was honestly set up to do really well before the war but the same location that made the town thrive pre-war made it get shit on during the war.   Fun Fact: Martinsburg changed hands 37 times and was burned to ground on more than one occassion.   You can still visit the old B&O roundhouse that the confederates loved to burn so much. It is being restored currently.   I can't tell from the borders but West Virginia gained Independence from Virginia mid-1862 officially (in the states eyes), in 1866 in the US govts eyes and Mid 1861 in spirit. That may help you narrow the time range down. Many people don't know West Virginia split to side with the union."

RBI,2ndums,Dharma_Lion,2,Tue Nov 25 16:51:01 2014 UTC,"I think this is it. Someone suggested that it was a map misaligned from the inside covers, but you said there was nothing on the covers. My guess is there should have been, and it got applied inside out, which is why you only see it on the covers (only way to confirm this would be to deconstruct the book, which I don't recommend), or it was a map recycled, which I am guessing is less likely.   Less of an investigation, more of a deduction, but that's my thoughts, Watson."

RBI,2mt6wu,CineSuppa,11,Thu Nov 20 00:41:01 2014 UTC,"This sucks man, I really hope you get your stuff back! It looked to me like they knew where to go. They went straight to the room on the left side in the video and it seemed like they weren't that interested in the other rooms of your house.  BTW, at 20:58 the guy looks straight in to the camera, if he's local someone will probably recognise him. How did they get in? Did they break a window?"
RBI,2mt6wu,einTier,8,Wed Nov 19 23:09:57 2014 UTC,"No, my stepmom went out for groceries and was gone for about an hour and a half, so she left the garage door unlocked (usually locked).   The left side of the video is where the hallway is to all of the bedrooms (there are 3), so they went there to scope out looking for valuables. We don't really have jewelry in the living room area (where the camera is located).  Hopefully someone will recognize him, yeah!! One of the news stations called me and said they will run the video, and possibly come by to interview me, so fingers tightly closed. I'm a girl and my mother's jewelry was all the jewelry I had :("

RBI,2mt6wu,CHClClCl,3,Thu Nov 20 01:17:00 2014 UTC,"Yeah holy mackerel. Give that original frame (darker one) and this to a specialist and I guarantee they can pull that guy's face up more.  Also, go to that spot in the house with a tape measure. Stick one end under your foot and stick it up as far as you can reach. Take one hand and move it to the 5-foot mark, and raise your finger by every 6 inches every couple seconds. Take that video and you can overlay it with this one to get his approximate height, if the camera hasn't moved."
RBI,2mt6wu,mikarm,4,Thu Nov 20 18:28:23 2014 UTC,"I'll be honest, that's really suspicious.    They came coincidentally when your stepmother was gone for a relatively small window of time and just happened to leave a door unlocked.  They also knew exactly where to go to get the ""good shit"".     They're not pros.  Pros are going to wear gloves, if anything, not try to handle everything by pulling their hoodie over their hands.  They'll probably also know that recoverable fingerprints don't happen that often and police departments aren't CSI and aren't going to spend the effort to match any recovered prints to anything.   They didn't go for any of the electronics.   They aren't rushing, they aren't pulling everything out and dumping it on the floor just to see what might be worth anything.  Jewelry really isn't as fencible as you'd think.  You don't get much for it and about the only place you can unload it is the pawn shop.  Cameras, gaming consoles, tools (oh God, tools), bicycles, that's the shit you really want to grab.    I'm not saying your stepmother set this up, but I will say these guys have been in your house before this day."
RBI,2mt6wu,friendinquotes,6,Thu Nov 20 01:23:07 2014 UTC,I highly doubt the stepmother is involved but I do think its possible they've been in the home before. it wonder if OP has had any repair men by recently? I also think someone has been casing the home for at least a week or two.
RBI,2mt6wu,huck_,4,Thu Nov 20 02:16:35 2014 UTC,"We've spoken to the neighbors and they mentioned that they've had people come by several times ringing their doorbells, so I do think they've been watching the house for a while, and knew the cars that were there that came and left, and went for it when they saw that both of the cars were gone. We haven't had repairs or gardeners or anything like that recently."
RBI,2mt6wu,EstellaH,3,Thu Nov 20 16:29:01 2014 UTC,"I would be tempted to agree, but we've had the dropcam for a while and this is the first time we detected activity when no one was home. Also, my stepmom is an art tutor and has art lessons very frequently in the home, so it's very rarely empty.   On the left where they go off camera is a hallway that connects to all of the bedrooms, so they just went there. They pulled EVERYTHING out and dumped it on the floor in the bedrooms. I didnt even know we had that much stuff! Why they didn't go for the electronics (we have a lot of expensive and high-tech stuff around the house), or rummage through the living room is beyond me"
RBI,2mt6wu,leera07,1 point,Thu Nov 20 16:27:12 2014 UTC,"Electronics usually have serial numbers that may or may not be registered with your insurance company.  The fact that they avoided it leads me to believe they're planning to pawn what they stole.  The police will say ""oh yeah we're checking the pawn stores"" but... check yourself.  Give them a call and let them know ""yeah, just call me if you come by any of it I'll even be willing to buy it from you."""
RBI,2mt6wu,Offthepoint,1 point,Thu Nov 20 18:28:18 2014 UTC,"I'll even be willing to buy it from you.""   Purely out of curiosity, do you really have to buy your stolen stuff back, or is this just lip service so that they might actually bother to call you?"
RBI,2mt6wu,EyeHamKnotYew,2,Fri Nov 21 12:40:06 2014 UTC,"In my experience, yes you have to buy it back.  The owner of the pawn shop will be a complete dickwad.  If Fred stole your necklace and brought it to Gary's pawn store, Gary should try to verify that Fred had legitimate possession of it.  Then Gary has to pay Fred for the necklace.  So if you're going in and saying ""yeah Fred stole my necklace, give it to me!""  You're accusing Gary of not doing his job right, and trying to get something from him for free.  Plus Gary probably also doesn't believe you."
RBI,2mt6wu,ab2005,1 point,Fri Nov 21 13:45:58 2014 UTC,"If it is a stolen item then the pawn shop is out whatever money they bought it for. If you can prove it is yours by serial number, some identifying mark, or a really good description of the jewelry then the police will recover it. They will also charge the person who pawned it with a second degree felony for every stolen item they pawned. Then the pawn shop can attempt to get restitution for the item from the person convicted of the crime but that hardly ever works out.  I've had people buy back an item their son or family member pawned but that is rare and obviously the preferred method for the pawn shop. They could have gone to the police and filed a report and got the item back free but then the person who pawned it gets that felony so sometimes they prefer to just buy it back.  That's why any good pawn shop is going to be song lots of questions about things they buy. I've had guys come in with pink iPods registered with a girls name and I turned them away. Some shops don't care though and will take the risk if they can get it cheap enough. If I saw some guys like this video come in with some nice jewelry I would be giving them the third degree."

Create an official record documenting the steps you've taken to try and resolve your situation, and let the law work for you. Worst case, you have the might of the legal system behind you.

RBI,2lufhu,dr0n33,3,Mon Nov 10 09:23:31 2014 UTC,I noticed that. It could have also been extracted from the 480p stream which could explain why I haven't been able to see a frame perfect match.
RBI,2lufhu,BeExtraordinary,6,Mon Nov 10 09:26:46 2014 UTC,It's definitely 1:38-1:39. The reason you can't see a frame perfect match is because she cropped it.
RBI,2lufhu,TaedW,7,Mon Nov 10 10:16:28 2014 UTC,I also agree.  The key bit to watch for is the tiny circle that is created and only present for about a second.  It would be sweet petty revenge to take the uncropped screenshot from that video (which has the other woman's name and so on) and paste to her Facebook wall and write something sweet and compassionate about her baby in heaven.
RBI,2lufhu,aftiggerintel,2,Mon Nov 10 17:03:23 2014 UTC,"Got it at 1:39. It's nearly identical and yes, the frame has been cropped so it blanks out the name and such.

Honestly I think letting the police handle this is the best course of action. The evidence is fantastic. All they have to do is put out an APB to look for the truck and they should find it pretty quickly. These are not smart criminals in any way, shape, or form. Police could also use the very clear images of the guy to see if anyone in the department recognizes him. Seems like they've done this a number of times before.

RBI,2lik2f,SubliminalHint,3,Sat Nov 8 03:33:25 2014 UTC,"Where does the road at the end of the driveway lead? Is that silver van a vehicle owned by a close neighbor? The truck pulls out behind that van a little while after it passes. If the van owners parked up ahead (like in their driveway) they might have noticed the truck go by as they were getting out. Or maybe the truck pulled up behind them at a stop sign or light. Just a thought.  The guy that went into the house looks to be ~50 years old to me, with that almond brown hair/mustache color. I'd think you could get a good estimate of his height by comparing the individual video frames of him on the steps with the height of that column. Not gonna help you find the truck but it could be helpful for a conviction or something.  That's an amazingly clear video for a home defense security system. I have to imagine there are other cameras in the system? Have you gotten any other good videos of the guy inside the house or the truck pulling around the backside of the house? Or even more of a front view of it pulling into the driveway from that side street? I'd imagine if you did you'd have posted them here already, but it's worth asking.  I agree with everyone else regarding the truck, look at all the online forums, ad placing websites, etc. Luckily that's a distinct vehicle.  On a funny note, was he trying to steal that little pumpkin or was it just sitting on that step? I really wanted him to pick that thing up and bring it with him. Sorry that this happened to you, people are pricks!  EDIT Shit sorry I didn't see the google drive folder before I asked about other cameras.

RBI,2l515s,Drsryan,2,Wed Nov 12 04:35:30 2014 UTC,"Two thoughts:  1. 31 states don't require a front license plate, so that leaves 19 states to sort through.  Georgia is one of those states that doesn't require a front license plate, so you could be on the right track, that is assuming he was compliant in the first place. 2. You said he rear-ended you, and you both went to a parking lot Have you gone back to the original site of the wreck to look for evidence? Also, there might be cameras at that intersection or in the parking lot where you went that could help."

But if more information gets this out there, I'll disclose additional details.  I was also very close to him. I'm the last one who had communication with him, via Skype, the night after he left. The call was very concerning as he said he either could come back and go to jail, or kill himself. He had always had a tendency for lying, possibly pathological, but on this call, he was honest in a completely raw way. Came clean about a lot of things. And his emotional state was honest. I knew when he lied and this was a scared man, who had been running from this for months. Who realized there were consequences to actions and he couldn't run forever. He said he had no money, I knew he had no job, and have looked into any other way he could have gotten money.  All he had was his car, which hadn't been paid on for at least two months, and a Sony Xperia tablet he used by hopping on wifi, outside a store to call me that night. The police have tried to determine if he could have sold it  and haven't found anything.   I want him found for a variety of reasons. He left behind a huge mess, I want to make sure he's ok, and also that this case is resolved.   I'll answerer whatever questions I feel comfortable with and can legally since it's still an open case."

RBI,2konqm,TinyDancer24,5,Wed Oct 29 15:52:47 2014 UTC,"First step in these is to realize the imprint is a reverse of the plate, so mirror the image right to left.  Step 2: the format of the plate serial number will help eliminate possibilities.  In CA typical plates are #LLL### as in 1ABC123.  Step 3: search a database of plates with suspected plates to see it matches the description.  Carfax for example lets you search for vehicle history by plate.  They will tell you a year make and model without purchasing anything, or some redditors have access to better databases or carfax subscriptions.  Step 4: Provide information to the police and be patient."
RBI,2konqm,itsnotmebob,3,Wed Oct 29 16:34:42 2014 UTC,"Thank you for the help! I didn't even think to look at carfax, maybe I can give that a shot once the license plate is sorted out.  I've tried to figure out what it is, and my guess thus far is (right to left): #MNA#8#. I have no idea if I'm even close to correct or if that would even be enough information to look something up, so I hope someone out there has a better eye than I do!"
RBI,2konqm,itsnotmebob,3,Wed Oct 29 16:41:39 2014 UTC,"Edit: Remember this is only GUESSING here  To start I would say 5MKH182, which carfax matches to a ford suv (I can't check color without an account)  **here's my breakdown of characters*  1st:5, generally unidentifiable, but flat top leads me to believe 5  2nd: M, possibly W, symmetry and middle line  3rd: K, two distinct angles matching california's unique K letter shape  4th: H, parallel edges  5th: 1, fairly clear  6th: 8, fairly clear  7th: 2, maybe a 9, based on marking only in lower left corner."
RBI,2konqm,Gengar11,2,Wed Oct 29 17:16:59 2014 UTC,"Thank you for your help and for the breakdown! Certainly seems like a possibility. I'm thinking about taking some more pictures, possibly of the first and last numbers to see if that might help! And maybe just set up a carfax account or send this information to the police to see if they get any matches."
RBI,2konqm,BackOff_ImAScientist,1 point,Wed Oct 29 18:10:14 2014 UTC,Here I edited the photo a bit; not sure if it will help but you seem to have better eyes then me.
RBI,2konqm,WestonP,6,Wed Oct 29 22:53:01 2014 UTC,One of the imprints definitely looks like batman.  But I think one of the numbers is an 8.
RBI,2konqm,TaedW,2,Wed Oct 29 16:45:45 2014 UTC,"Ahaha. You know, I've been having a pretty crappy few days even prior to this, so thanks for that. And yes, one questionable letter/number down!"
RBI,2konqm,TaedW,4,Wed Oct 29 16:51:20 2014 UTC,"First, I would suggest using a piece of paper and a pencil over the area to try to capture the impression of it, then flip that horizontally, and see what you come up with for the plate. That's likely to yield a few more clues than we would be able to see in a picture. Good job at taking pictures at multiple angles, though... that is definitely a good idea to help capture any three-dimensional details.  The first and the last digits are especially unclear, but here's what I see...  6 M K A 1 8 ?  The '6' first digit is sort of an educated guess that appears to fit the imprint.  The 'K' imprint looked close to an 'N' or an 'X', but looking more closely at the details, I would believe it to be a 'K'.  I don't have a solid feeling for the last digit, but if it's a California plate (which the sequence appears to be), it should be a number. Searching the possible plate numbers on CarFax, 6MKA180 appears to be a Ford Escape, 6MKA182 looks like a Ford Expedition, and 6MKA186 shows a Chevy Tahoe. Based on the description, '2' would seem to be the winner, but that actually does not feel like a match to me, at least with the CA plate font... It looks like there's a rounded shape near the middle left, so I'd most suspect a '6', but it's hard to tell. It looks like one or both vehicles may have moved or shifted during the contact, so there's sort of a smearing effect that might have added a few bad clues."
RBI,2konqm,WestonP,3,Wed Oct 29 17:04:52 2014 UTC,"The CarFax method is good.  I had used the DMV Smog History which used to / sometimes gives the locations of the smog testers, so you can then get an idea of where the car ""lives""."
RBI,2konqm,RichardKeester,3,Thu Oct 30 00:31:17 2014 UTC,"Actually, if you create a free account at MyCarFax.com, which is different from regular paid CarFax, you can get some of the CarFax info after adding it to your car list.  For purposes such as these, you can get the service history (at shops that report it).  Using that info, you can get an idea where the car ""lives"" to see if it's possibly the one you're looking for.  For example, for the Ford Expedition above:   12/16/2006        Bob Wondries Ford (Alhambra, CA) Vehicle serviced"
RBI,2konqm,humakavulaaaa,2,Thu Oct 30 00:44:42 2014 UTC,"Great suggestion! I'm only afraid of making it more illegible than it already is, so maybe I'll take a couple more good shots of it and then give that a go! Also, thank you for your help and for checking it out on carfax as well! I'm thinking about maybe setting up an account to get some more information on the possible cars and maybe sending it to the police."
RBI,2konqm,kowboy42,3,Wed Oct 29 18:12:18 2014 UTC,No need for an account... You can enter the plate in right on their website and it will tell you the year/make/model for free. Pretty handy for this kind of stuff.

Here is the Google Map overhead showing the Pharma and the location of the apartments: http://i.imgur.com/aigvrqe.jpg  Here is a ground level view verifying this is the exact spot from the photograph: http://i.imgur.com/1vqEUFN.jpg  The name of the condominiums is Edgeley in the Village. I have outlined where I believe the photograph was likely captured from: http://i.imgur.com/C9m125N.jpg  There is a small park at the rear of the condos that could be where the stairs and bench pictures originated from. Also, based on some research of the area it appears to be a rough neighborhood.  Here are some reference links:  http://wikimapia.org/13552942/Edgeley-in-the-Village  http://www.emporis.com/building/edgeley-in-the-village-toronto-canada  http://www.tobuilt.ca/php/tobuildings_more.php?search_fd3=865  We were not able to discern if the interior images could be linked to the same location.

(My apologies if you are actually one of the others and already know about this.)    Also, based on the information on the Ancestry thread, there's an article in here about him being an accomplice to a hold-up slaying in 1941 (apparently supplied the guns to the two other boys who committed the hold-up): http://newspaperarchive.com/us/california/berkeley/berkeley-daily-gazette/1941/08-06/page-7"
RBI,2jspyu,sadmarmoset,3,Mon Oct 20 17:46:06 2014 UTC,"That would be me. It was some time after that that I got in contact with Warren's niece, and learned she too was looking for him, and had hit a dead end.  I recently have been back in touch with her, after taking a break for a bit, and there's still been no new info.  The info regarding the slaying is about him. I found several articles, from throughout the US, about that case. It was a pretty big deal at the time! I even found an article with a picture of his parents and brother, and a picture of him as a teen -- none of which I had seen before. (Edit: He was the getaway driver for the robbery, and claimed he didn't know what was going down when he took his friends to the store... whether you believe that or not).  But, for the life of me, I can't figure out if he's alive and out there somewhere, or if he passed away at some point.  It is quite possible (based on the little my mom knew of him) that he may have been involved in some other crime(s) as an adult. But I don't believe he would still be locked up."

RBI,2jspyu,aftiggerintel,3,Mon Oct 20 18:14:09 2014 UTC,"Based on age, military service would be in WW2 so if he's alive then there might be a record that way. I know many WW2/Korea Vets use the VA as their only source of medical care. If the one near his last location(s) doesn't help then you could try the VSO for the county you last know he lived in to help with it."
RBI,2jspyu,aftiggerintel,2,Mon Oct 20 18:59:11 2014 UTC,"As far as alive or dead, he isn't showing up on an Obit search or findagrave so there's a chance he's still alive."
RBI,2jspyu,sadmarmoset,2,Mon Oct 20 19:05:13 2014 UTC,"Please excuse my ignorance, but how might I go about checking with local VA hospitals? I believe he was enlisted in the Army in October of 1945 (so, technically after WWII ended). The paperwork I found online said it was a ""one year enlistment"". Would that qualify for VA benefits?"
RBI,2jspyu,aftiggerintel,3,Mon Oct 20 19:08:54 2014 UTC,"It would for medical. My father served 18 months and receives all of his medical from the VA. My grandfather was in 8 months during WW2 and received all his care from the local VA.       Best way to go about it is to call their operator and ask the specific procedures for that administration. The procedures for say Puget Sound VA is different than Eastern Nebraska-Western Iowa, etc. I called the operator at the local VA hospital near his last location and asked about finding my father when he went missing. They found him in their nursing home section but only after we (sister and I) pushed them for finding out where he was at. He called us disoriented and talking about medical treatment so it made our job easier. If a veteran has a claim or any sort of benefit then he would be in the system. I've seen many administrations ask you write a letter to him with your contact info then place that into a sealed envelop. In an outer envelop you can explain to the VA who you are and why you are trying to contact along with any information you have on him (include service number). They'll be able to forward the letter onward to him.        If the local VA is unable to help, contact the local vet groups like VFW and American Legion. Sometimes they will have him on the rolls or know someone who knows him.       Even the VSO (veteran service organization) will possibly be able to help. They are county funded so not necessarily connected to one another but might have info if he came into their office and received their help."
RBI,2jspyu,ShamelessFox,2,Tue Oct 21 01:31:53 2014 UTC,"I believe he would be eligible, as per here:  http://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apply/veterans.asp  However, that doesn't necessarily mean he ever utilized his benefits.   I did a rotation in school at the VA (I'm in health care), and they have one of the best and most complete electronic health care record systems I've ever seen. The whole system is linked up, so you shouldn't have to check at multiple VA sites.  I don't know how much information they'll be allowed to give you because of health care privacy laws, but it sounds like it's worth a try."
RBI,2jspyu,puhleez420,1 point,Mon Oct 20 21:10:12 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't call it one of the best. Especially when you get erroneous notes in your medical records that pertain to other patients (ones not even seen at the same clinic) - happened last week so not an old issue either. It isn't linked either in the sense that your full record is opened. They can, however, pull the remote profile to see which VA something would need sent to for them to forward it onward. Letters for contact are normally sent to the Regional Office rather than medical center but I have seen them help when trying to find someone."

Is your mother still alive? Still married to him? It may screw up his relationship with your mom, if she is still alive and married to him.  The usual way to pull a birth certificate is to have the child's name and date of birth, usually city/state or at least the county/state, and the name of at least one of the parents. The request must usually come from someone legally entitled to the record. I don't know the law in Florida so I don't know if you would be able to request it."

If she's a minor, then it will result in a divorce, considering my mom and step-dad met when I was 4, and have been married for 25 years.  I would assume there is unpaid child support.   Yes my mother is still alive and still married to him. It will definitely fuck up the relationship no matter what.   Without any information as to a name, birth year, exact location in FL, I think you're right, I only have his information.   Last, he's kinda sketchy dude anyway. After Vietnam he couldn't get work anywhere so he worked for the ""Bilotti's"" doing exactly what I don't know, but he's told me ""I've done things I'm not proud of"" and ""I collected money."" ""I don't drop names."" ""Some people call me Pauly the Carpenter.""   When we lived in Staten Island, he had tons of sketchy friends. I should add that he's Sicilian."

I can't make up my mind if this should be upvoted or downvoted.  As long as Tori is campaigning for the indictment of innocent persons, I feel people should be aware of the facts.  Is there a way to ""sign"" the petition and warn others that it is, with all due respect, delusional?"
RBI,2i4yua,Techwood111,14,Fri Oct 3 08:53:21 2014 UTC,At the very least she should be trying to make the case that her daughter was so traumatized by the stalking that it lead her to suicide.

But non the less after almost 2 years of not giving us any documents or things we requested we were finally able to get the evidence that her body was MOVED POSTMORTEM (after she was already dead) and bodies can not do that on their own.  She was redressed (we have that evidence as well) and posed.  There is also much more evidence of an intruder and a murder.

RBI,2i4yua,sinenox,15,Sat Oct 4 06:51:34 2014 UTC,"Toni is at it again. No surprise. My sympathy over the loss of Morgan is real. The disgust I feel over blaming innocent people is huge.  From the moment her good friend the psychic told her Morgan was murdered, she has been off the rails. It was Jennifer the psychic who told her the ""stalker"" was hiding on the roof, barefoot in the winter, in Colorado. Jennifer feeds Toni's paranoia. Toni also claims big named psychics have also said Morgan was murdered. Yet when contacted, they deny knowing her or giving her a reading.   Toni claims everything in her blog is the truth. The truth according to Toni and Jennifer is more like it. I have a few questions...   Toni, why do you delete comments on the blog that ask legitimate questions or that disagree with you? I'm not talking about nasty comments, I'm asking about legitimate questions. Why did you sanitize Morgan's social media accounts? Many pictures of Morgan with friends, that showed Morgan as a normal kid having fun with friends were removed. Why? Why haven't you mentioned Morgan's current boyfriend, who worked with Steve, spent the night sleeping on the couch, yet heard nothing? In the past you said Morgan's room often looked like a tornado went through it, yet after she died you said her room was ransacked? Rewriting history? Why don't you admit that both you and Steve write under your name on the blog? Do you think people are too dumb to notice the different writing styles? When you and Steve were with your son for sports, Morgan suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning. Yet when your son stayed in that very room, he nor any other family member of the household did. The blame was placed on incorrect ductwork, yet Morgan was the only one affected. Doesn't that seem odd to you? Morgan loved you and Steve very much. Due to the difference in age between her and the older kids, the three of you were three peas in a pod. You went overboard and were a helicopter parent, both before and after Morgan's death. Keeping that in mind, if you really thought there was a stalker, why was there not one camera focused on the center of the supposed stalking, that being Morgan's room? The Sheriff's office put up one and it caught nothing. How do you explain that? Oh yeah, Jennifer the psycho user explained that, he was on the roof with a telescoping rod! This amazing stalker is a genius! He is literally the invisible man!"

There is some very interesting discussion going on here regarding your daughter's case that I am not sure if you are aware of:  Websleuths Crime Sleuthing Community Part 1  Websleuths Crime Sleuthing Community Part 2  I have not read these posts (I sifted through a few of the 100 or so pages of responses) but they appear to be a very dedicated and respectful community of amateur internet sleuths who may be worth engaging.
RBI,2i4yua,sadmarmoset,28,Fri Oct 3 00:21:18 2014 UTC,"She's likely already aware of Websleuths, insofar as they've completely disagreed with her.  I agree that they are a generally dedicated and respectful community - I post there often.  There's actually no evidence that her daughter was stalked or murdered. There seems to be much more evidence that Mrs. Ingram has some serious problems.  I'm very sorry for her that her daughter died, but she has slandered some people who are likely completely innocent.  It appears that Morgan chose to end her own life, and that is a very sad thing that I don't wish on anyone. However, I find Mrs. Ingram's actions before and after her daughter's death to be pretty deplorable. There's pretty good summary here:    http://truthformorgan.tumblr.com/"

They've accused my business of theft and fraud, claimed my daughter was pregnant at 11, claimed I impersonated cops and doctors, all because I posted a link to the autopsy, police reports, and tox screen.  She falsified evidence and took it to the police, claiming I was calling and harassing her.

Websleuths actually closed the public threads about Morgan after realizing that something was not quite right with Toni Ingram's response to her death.  Because there was no evidence of a crime, the threads were closed, and only reopened after the Dr. Phil show was aired. There is an additional thread in their ""Parking Lot"" forum which is accessible to members only.   When someone posted Toni's blog initially, the posters on the forum took it at face value and spent a whole lot of time investigating the details and trying to find additional evidence for the family in an effort to support them.  It became very apparent when the police, autopsy, and toxicology reports were made available that Toni Ingram was refusing to face facts.

RBI,2i4yua,ArcadeGoon,8,Sat Oct 4 05:14:08 2014 UTC,"I've read about this story on your blog and other sites like others on this thread have. I just don't see why a stalker would break into your house and force your daughter to take pills she had in her room (how would he even know they were there?) instead of beating, strangling, or stabbing her which would be much easier methods of murder.   And why was this person not caught on your security cameras when he entered the house? Why didn't you hear sounds of a struggle and your daughter screaming coming from her room when you claim that on previous occasions you could hear buttons being pressed on the front door keypad (a murder would certainly be louder than some beeping)? Surely your daughter would start screaming and fighting if someone broke into her room rather than just silently agree to take some pills, right? It just doesn't make sense.   I think if we piece together what you said, that Morgan was having a fight with that boyfriend of hers and broke up with him and was really upset, that she came home and mouthed off to you and then went into her room and shut the door, she likely made an emotional and impulsive decision to take the pills and end her life. I feel bad for her and you her family members, but it's a more likely explanation than a guy broke in and made her take the pills, right?"

Because I read the news and I have spoken to some of these parents.  Do not ever think that your child is safe from a predator that wants them, you can try your best but you can not always save them.  I would never have thought that when raising my 3 children, but now I know this to be true and it is an ugly truth that most people do not want to believe.

Toni also threw aspersions on this same man as a possible suspect in this latest ""stalking"", even naming him on her libelous blog for a time.

She had been stalked and terrorized. She had been diagnosed as a 14 year old with a condition called hyperalgesia, (increased sensitivity to pain), this condition would cause her to experience extreme pain whenever she tensed up, or was under stress. She could help herself to feel better by employing yoga, meditation, relaxation techniques, music, etc. into her lifestyle, which she did. Keeping stress out of her life was very important. She was finally very fit and happy for the last 2 years of her life until the stalker came and took it all away. This is a felony stalking case and we believe it should also be a murder case. She was exhausted from the loud bangs against her window in the middle of the night, she was stressed out because she had to always be on guard, carry pepper spray, call the Sheriff's when he appeared in the dark to scare her, or follow her. She lost weight over this 4 month period that she was stalked, had dark circles under her eyes, she was pale and wiped out. She couldn't continue her daily regimant of ballet twice a day. We believe her chronic stress from the stalker killed her. We have heard that oxidized stress over time can do horrible things to a body, and that you CAN be scared or frightened to death.  http://web.archive.org/web/20121008011553/http://community.discovery.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/655100142/m/79419008011  .... how it's evolved from there..."

I could see that, maybe some strange guy was after her. But her death looks like a self inflicted drug overdose on what are essentially sedatives (amyltriptaline, nortriptyline, and cyclobenzaprine).   It's too hard for me to believe that anyone would show up and force someone to take 30+ pills, especially without any evidence of a struggle. Why wouldn't they kill her using a physical method? Pills could be puked back up, and if it failed to kill her, she could identify the perpetrator later. Seems too risky.   Pills are something someone chooses for suicide because it's viewed as relatively painless. The idea is that they'll just fall asleep and never wake up. But a guy intent on killing someone would likely not put too much consideration into the ease of their victim's death.

It is usually used in conjunction with an inert gas like helium or nitrogen, which prevents the panic, sense of suffocation and struggling during unconsciousness (the hypercapnic alarm response) usually caused by the deprivation of oxygen in the presence of carbon dioxide. This method also makes the direct cause of death difficult to trace if the bag and gas canister are removed before the death is reported.

How long was he planning on returning? When were the parents informed of his plan? How close was he to graduating school? That would definitely factor into any plans to leave the country. Furthermore, did he intend on the move to Saudi Arabia to be a permanent one?  I am so sorry as this must be a terribly trying time for you."
RBI,2h1qfv,funkalunatic,5,Mon Sep 22 05:15:38 2014 UTC,"The possibilities you mention seem the most likely.  1) Craigslist scammers and robberies are common. Hopefully the police are investigating this angle.  2) Partial westernization and unwillingness to return to non-Western regimes is common among people from the Middle East who come here for school. Even if the family is well-heeled, they may want to stay in the US. It seems unlikely that contact would just be dropped altogether though, but there could be things like depression or other mental issues playing a role as well.  I might add:  3) Mugging or drug deal gone wrong or something else conventional. The LA area isn't exactly devoid of violent crime."

What kind of music does the scammer like, and does the Facebook profile like the same thing? Do they make the same spelling errors? Even if it's circumstantial, there are a lot of little things that would increase your confidence in your identification.  You've probably already aggressively Googled the name you found on Facebook, but also reverse image search all photos on the Facebook and all photos you were sent by the scammer (was this a romance or investment type of scam?) and look at the metadata to see if they were automatically tagged with GPS coordinates that might be helpful.  There's probably not much you can legally do unless you can somehow trick them into confessing or giving you more evidence, and even then I am not a lawyer so I don't really know.

RBI,2gmq52,usedforsecrets,7,Thu Sep 18 04:56:32 2014 UTC,"First, since the crime took place on the internet (voip phone), it's taken place across state lines, which makes it a federal matter. Contact your local FBI office.   The FBI has regular contact with level3 (level3 is a huge business-facing isp), and can contact level3 to grab the call records which should match the number up with a specific customer of level3. Level3 will then hand their records off to the FBI, and the FBI will contact that customer to determine that sub-customer's identity.  It could go another layer deeper after that, or it could lead you to the person who owns the account.  Unfortunately, it's possible that the person threatening you connected via a proxy somewhere else in the world, a country that might not extradite such records to the united states. Though, this is a little bit rare.  I'd recommend you take the following precautions:  Get yourself & your girlfriend some mace, and a knife. A gun would also help if you're comfortable with that.  Get some surveillance equipment in and around your house, and start keeping track of cars you are used to seeing on your block."

Your and our girlfriend also need to start operating with a higher level of awareness.  Don't be paranoid, but start taking note of people you see, what cars are parked nearby, things like that.  She should consider getting a new number and only giving it out to people she trusts, and give them instructions on to give out her new number.  She should also consider doing the same thing with social media accounts.  More often than not, cases like this turn out to be a friend messing with the victim.  In cases where it's not, it could be an ex, an acquaintance, co-worker, classmate, old friend, who knows.  The hard part in investigating these cases is trying to track the number.   Warrants can take weeks or even months to see results.  Even then there are ways people can send texts and emails that are untraceable.  Which means it often leads to a dead end.  Even if the warrants do lead to a specific account, you then have to locate the device and figure out who was using it.  It's much easier if you have a list of suspects to talk to."
RBI,2gmq52,thehighercritic,11,Wed Sep 17 06:32:59 2014 UTC,"I would recommend one other thing with the new number. Sign up for Google voice. Have it setup so all her calls as the Google Voice number show up.

RBI,2gmq52,craftman2010,7,Wed Sep 17 16:38:42 2014 UTC,"I already know what my superiors would say.  We often suggest that people   obtain their CPL (you can apply at the front counter), or learn how to defend themselves.  Im not suggesting that OP and his GF become vigilantes and start hunting people.  They do, however, need to be aware of their surroundings, and they should at least try prepare to defend themselves if necessary.  You every try dialing 9-1-1 when someone is assaulting you? it's not so easy.  And when you do get through, you have to relay information to dispatch, they have to dispatch it officers, then it takes time for a police response.  Obviously if OP discovers the identity of the stalker they should call the investigating officer, in the event of an emergency they should call 9-1-1.  But in a life or death situation they should try to defend themselves, not allow themselves to be victims."

Searching in the areas surrounding areas of the station  Talking to janitors at the train station  Writing a desperate public FB post with a Rome address for them to mail my things  talking to locals and people in that area.   Where do you live?  It makes no sense that you can do these things if you're an American living in America, who was just about to get on a plane presumably back to America from Italy.  You say in another comment that you have negatives, I didn't realize photographers even used film cameras anymore, since Digital has surpassed the quality/cost on professional cameras.  Unless I'm mistaken of course.  You can call me a skeptic all you like, but your story has a few holes in it and it points me that way.  Even with the pictures that have been posted to kickstarter.

Whatever you do, do NOT boot the system, if you already have, shut it down. Every byte written to that hard drive will make it more difficult to recover data.  To answer your original question, take an image of that drive using Acronis TrueImage (using sector copy method!), Ghost or one of the free solutions like dd, CloneZilla, just in case.  To recover deleted files, mount the drive as a second drive, using an external dock, or boot the original system with a recovery CD/DVD so the original drive isn't touched.  There are several free tools which let you recover deleted files, such as Recuva and 'Restore', both compatible with 64bit Windows.

I came out of this store literally less than five minutes after entering, only to find that a car hit my own vehicle while backing out (turned the wheel too far to the right while reversing, hitting the passenger side of my car).  The store has security camera footage of the parking lot, but cannot release it to me.  They will provide a description tomorrow of the offending vehicle, though, but said their camera resolution is historically too poor to make out any license plates.    As I was away for less than five minutes, and the paint scraped onto my car from the other vehicle is white, I'm reasonably sure that it was the white vehicle seen in this video from when I pulled into the parking lot.  Also, that parking space next to me was empty upon leaving, and I find it hard to believe that anyone else would have parked there and then left in that amount of time.  Is there any hope of determining the make and model of this car?  And is my video angle too poor to determine the license plate?  Any help or advice would be much appreciated.

But I'm guessing only the cops can get that video.  3) The white SUV is a Mercedes GLK class SUV (thinking 2010-2012 350 model based on the wheels), but I'm on my phone right now, so will try to confirm that later.  4) License plate is impossible to figure out, just not enough data from what I've seen so far."
RBI,2g85yd,jeepdave,1 point,Fri Sep 12 19:42:01 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the input.  I'm not super-worried about privacy, but didn't want to make the location plainly obvious since reddit has been known to go on witch-hunts over seemingly minor things.  What precautions would you take in the future if someone wanted to ensure location privacy?  Yeah, I figured the license plate is a bust.  It seems clearer on the video file directly from the camera, compared to the youtube link... not sure if that's me going cross-eyed or something else.  It's a Texas license plate, if that helps.  One of the black and white 2014 ones, I think, but can't tell for sure."
RBI,2g85yd,alientity,3,Fri Sep 12 19:57:26 2014 UTC,"YouTube will definitely lower quality, if you can upload the original video, that would be very helpful (be careful with saving the clip, as that also could lead to loss of quality).   Best shot is to upload the entire 1-5 minute dash cam segment to Dropbox or a similar service, shouldn't be a big file, just make sure there aren't any privacy issues if you are recording the audio.  As for your privacy question, you would have had to mask an area in the video, and that process could affect quality, so you didn't have much choice. I only mentioned it because of the throw away."

Someone has come forward as a witness and given me a name asking only for their anonymity to be left intact. I'm very disappointed that this has happened, and I am offering this student a chance to drop the phone off, or leave it behind in our next session anonymously.

RBI,2fzb84,Parasamgate,3,Wed Sep 10 23:32:18 2014 UTC,"This happens all the time at the university I work at.  Have you connected to the college's wifi before?  Assuming the college has an ""enterprise class"" wifi system, the network/wifi folks should have a record of your device's MAC address based on your username (assuming it's not a free-for-all wifi system).  Ask them if they can set up an alert and/or track the device's MAC address if it tries to access the college wifi system.   If the device comes online an alert should be generated (we use email and SMS) and they can go to the general area (eg: physics access point 1).  Once they get the general area, they can use software tools to lock onto the MAC address and get within a couple of feet of the device based on its wifi signal-strength if it's on and active.  If they cannot track the device and the thief is using it for wifi access on campus, the network/wifi folks may be able to see what username is accessing the wifi for that mac address.  If the person uses the wifi on campus it should come up with his/her username.   With this information, the network folks can ask the Dean of students or PD call them in or just go visit them personally via the class schedule associated with the username.  Most enterprise-class wifi systems have tracking capability and the necessary tools to troubleshoot issues ont he wifi system.  However a lot of this depends on your administrator's level of knowledge and logs keeping practices.  Good luck!"

RBI,2fzb84,SourMilk,3,Wed Sep 10 17:11:44 2014 UTC,"Do you think addressing the stolen phone in a direct manner via the Professor will just scare off the thief into not returning it whatsoever? The phone is currently bricked by my service provider. No information can be salvaged from it and it cannot be used whatsoever.   The only thing I can imagine the thief do at this point is to sell it for parts.  However, that being said I was wondering if I can use some kind of mental trick or something to force the thief into giving it back to me so that I can unlock it. I think addressing the fact that a phone was ""stolen"" will scare the thief.

(Or they may know from experience that nothing can be done.)  If they make that judgement call, just accept it, say you understand, and it'll look good to them.  If you argue or beg them to address it you will look childish, so don't be that way and you'll leave a good impression on the prof.  Or they may be super helpful, and have an ingenious speech to make the thief afraid for his or her very future for a few months even if the phone is never seen again.

RBI,2fzb84,kvazar,2,Wed Sep 10 13:11:37 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I'm 99% sure the phone is gone for good.  The thief snagged a phone right out from under someone's nose without them noticing.  He has probably done this several times before.  They'll see right through a global ""Someone In This Room Is A Thief"" speech, and know that nobody has any idea who it is.  If there are video cameras in the lecture hall, that's something and the prof may point out who to talk to about seeing the tapes.  Prof also may want to deliver a warning, telling people there's been an unfortunate incident and to keep watch over their stuff because it isn't safe.  So, still worth asking.  Also worth considering, the thief may not even be in that class.  That may have been the only day they'll be in that room that term.

There's also ones for bodily injury by under, or un-insured, drivers.  Here's a bit from wiki. Defining an uninsured motorist for the purpose of an uninsured motorist clauseEdit  There are three types of uninsured motorists defined under the uninsured motorist clause:  1) Individuals who do not have liability coverage for the vehicle he or she is operating. In most states, it is a crime to be uninsured in this manner. 2) When an individual flees the scene of an accident without leaving sufficient information to identify him or herself, the individual is considered uninsured for the purposes of an uninsured motorist provision. Note, however, that a positive ID of the license plates in a hit and run accident will often be considered by insurance companies sufficient information to identify the negligent Hit and run driver. Such identification will often lead to the denial of an uninsured motorist claim, as insurance companies will often litigate the claim, bringing in the registered owner of the vehicle with matching plates, even when that person denies involvement in the accident. Property damage by an unidentified hit and run will be covered by collision insurance in several states, including:[2] California Colorado Georgia Illinois Ohio A stolen vehicle is uninsured from the time it has been stolen. A person who has been injured by a stolen vehicle may qualify for an uninsured claim."

RBI,2fuzr9,kilamumster,2,Wed Sep 10 14:53:32 2014 UTC,"I'm not an expert but I've had to research my family's extensive, tangled lines. Here's where I'd start:   Do you know your dad's grandparents' last name?  Does your grandmother have the same name as they did when she got married? You'll need the license for her and your grandfather's marriage. If you know the town and date, you can contact them (or the county records office) for a copy. If her married name is on the license, you can pursue that lead. Look at your dad's original birth certificate. they may have indicated what pregnancy and what birth this was, e.g., 3rd pregnancy, 2nd live birth, or whatever. This info may not be on a certified copy, and it may be difficult or impossible to get a copy of an original (but you can try!). Edit: /r/whatisthisthing is a pretty active sub that can help you identify photograph locations or buildings, uniforms, etc.   If your grandmother was stationed at Farragut, Idaho it might tighten the timeline, according to this blog:   Both the Naval Training Station and the Hospital were decommissioned on 15 June 1946. In October, the Farragut College and Technical Institute opened its doors and utilized most of the Training Station’s buildings. This educational enterprise mainly served veterans learning new civilian skills. By 1949, these educational needs had been met, and the facility closed in May, leaving the structures once more empty.    Do a search on variations of your grandmother's name, birth name, hometown and name, etc. You might get a hit on a blog, or sadly, an obituary of the possible first husband. Hopefully not of the child.   When I was searching, I had to remember that some people do not want to be found. And I might not like what I found.   btw, Remind your dad that he's got YOU. You sound awesome. Good luck in your search!"

It is very unlikely that this man is alive, since I'd imagine he'd be almost 100 at this point, so I am not concerned about this, and I don't believe my father is either.

May not have known that he did anything wrong, they drive around and look for old appliances left out or anything metal really.  Not saying he had a right to come on your property."
RBI,2fm3ft,TeamDisrespect,3,Sat Sep 6 04:55:24 2014 UTC,I leave anything metal in the alley behind my shop for the scrapers. Saves me a trip to the recycler.
RBI,2fm3ft,simbean,2,Sun Sep 7 01:56:20 2014 UTC,Definitely an older Ford F150. I would guess early 90s. I'll try to come back with specifics.

In this case though, the dryer was placed in a hard to reach spot behind my trailer. If another car was parked in the carport they would've been unable to get to it, so to me this makes it an intentional and obvious theft.   The item the guy picked up and left on the trailer is an unused padlock I had sitting there."

RBI,2fkmqq,drsuperfly,25,Fri Sep 5 22:07:31 2014 UTC,"I think it's supposed to say ""Vial"".  There's a tag ""vialgraffiti"" on Instagram that has several similar.  Mostly uploaded by the account ""midwestrydersentertainment"", which also just happens to have a cropped version of the image OP posted.  Interesting.  Similarities:   Same angle with the bricks. Right edge of the 'L' lines up with apartment window on the building behind the car. 'V' lines up on tire where vandal sprayed over the wheel well. White / Silver sedan behind truck's windshield: all features line up between photos.   I.E., same photo.  Uploaded to Instagram half an hour ago.  The blurb on the account:   This is My Life in My City TCMN Trespassing For Art Urban Explorer I left my swag somewhere where you can follow it #followme   So, who's Midwest Ryderz Entertainment?  Reposting photos of other peoples' graffiti for likes and followers, or the ""artist"" themselves?  Edit: I think it's unlikely they're the tagger, but the hashtags on the photos might lead somewhere.  Edit:  Also has a second angle of the 'LMB Vial BUMR' graffiti posted by drsuperfly.  Edit2 : Another one."
RBI,2fkmqq,squirrelpotpie,6,Sat Sep 6 00:42:22 2014 UTC,This is probably the best bit of information to find the vandal.
RBI,2fkmqq,SubwaySteve,2,Sat Sep 6 01:28:14 2014 UTC,"The Instagram accounts you posted feature dozens of other artists too, they are generic local graffiti posters.  Had you checked a few hours earlier you probably would have found the same account I did, but I sent them a screenshot of the twitter post and the account was quickly deleted.  I know /r/RBI will feel a certain type of way about that, but I've read enough reddit cut their hands off graffiti rants to know we're not on the same team here."
RBI,2fkmqq,squirrelpotpie,3,Sat Sep 6 01:31:35 2014 UTC,"You make a good point.  So how does one determine if this is the guy doing the graffiti or someone that just posts other people's graffiti?  The guy posted on his site ""This is My Life in My City TCMN Trespassing For Art Urban Explorer I left my swag somewhere where you can follow it""  Is he saying the graffiti is his swag?  It could mean a number of different things."
RBI,2fkmqq,fnordfnordfnordfnord,3,Sat Sep 6 02:40:23 2014 UTC,"I didn't think it was likely the same person.  I seemed to be getting somewhere with the hashtags, and I do know graffiti artists who post it.  They aren't the ones deserving of the air quotes though, they're people doing it legitimately by commission, in cooperation with the property owners.  Fun fact, the idiots who go around spraying tags illegally screw things up for these legit people too.  Everybody assumes spraypaint on walls is vandalism done to be a punk, so the legit murals get lumped in the same boat and cleaned up, covered or re-sprayed.  People don't realize the property owner paid hundreds of dollars for it.  Friend was involved in one where a TV show wanted graffiti for a commercial spot, and painted over a thousand-dollar commission that took seven people all day to make.  They just assumed the property owner had been vandalized by surprisingly classy taggers."
RBI,2fkmqq,doejohndoe1,0,Sat Sep 6 08:50:29 2014 UTC,"And you would have gotten a lot further with the hashtags if a certain account hadn't been tipped off and subsequently deleted hours before you started.

I've been painting for a decade or so, there's nothing you can tell me about it."

RBI,2f63n1,bigbadjesus,21,Mon Sep 1 16:04:05 2014 UTC,"I hate to break it to you, but police really don't care all that much about stolen phones.  Even if you give them exact GPS coordinates, names and addresses, they won't do anything about it most of the time."
RBI,2f63n1,Interrnet,2,Mon Sep 1 17:16:42 2014 UTC,"Very true, but its best not to interfere until the cops get involved. If they do nothing I say go for it and fuck around with this scumfuck."
RBI,2f63n1,drkhead,1 point,Tue Sep 2 01:34:58 2014 UTC,"Honestly, when I lived in NYC, license plates got stolen once, all 4 tires on my car got slashed another time, both times the NYPD essentially tried to convince me not to file any paperwork."
RBI,2f63n1,n3rv,0,Tue Sep 2 11:39:53 2014 UTC,"Tell them he's a terrorist, to phone owners everywhere! Then again they might just drone him from space, then how you gonna get that phone back!?"
RBI,2f63n1,thetinguy,0,Tue Sep 2 03:24:03 2014 UTC,"No, you can only erase an iPhone through Find My iPhone."

RBI,2f63n1,MrJens,1 point,Tue Sep 2 12:32:37 2014 UTC,Honestly it would be great fun and I'm sure I could get him to admit to stealing it within a matter of minutes but I am far too tired to do so.
RBI,2f63n1,cortexstack,6,Tue Sep 2 15:49:32 2014 UTC,That homework was assigned to OP.  Sorry for the confusion.
RBI,2f63n1,MrJens,1 point,Mon Sep 1 14:58:36 2014 UTC,"Makes sense, I'd be up for it anyway if it was morning :P"
RBI,2f63n1,squirrelpotpie,1 point,Mon Sep 1 15:00:28 2014 UTC,"This sub is not for hiring Reddit armies to harass people.  Everyone but OP needs to stay the fuck out of any disputes brought up in here.  To do anything else would only cause harm to anything going on.  For example, getting OP charged with cyberstalking and harassment of a minor would be decidedly less than helpful.  Give information and assistance, without doxxing, only."

RBI,2f63n1,anonymousmouse2,3,Tue Sep 2 08:06:02 2014 UTC,"You've got a name, a face, and a location. Time to talk to the police! Idk about NYC cops but when my wife's phone was stolen in SF they were extremely helpful.   Keep monitoring your photo stream, make sure to change your passwords on email, etc."
RBI,2f63n1,manunderboard,2,Thu Sep 4 04:52:55 2014 UTC,It's Harlem... a stolen phone is the least of the police's concerns.
RBI,2f63n1,thelotusknyte,3,Tue Sep 2 00:38:40 2014 UTC,I think there's a phone locator service with iPhones....
RBI,2f63n1,lil_jimmy_norton,5,Thu Sep 4 04:56:02 2014 UTC,I doubt it's extremely useful in NYC where a given location can be a multi story apartment building.
RBI,2f63n1,thelotusknyte,4,Mon Sep 1 16:36:34 2014 UTC,"True, but people gotta go outside some time."
RBI,2f63n1,lil_jimmy_norton,3,Mon Sep 1 16:38:42 2014 UTC,What is this outside you speak of?

RBI,2f63n1,thelotusknyte,1 point,Tue Sep 2 00:49:51 2014 UTC,Unfortunately Find my iphone was turned off since the phone was updated last time..
RBI,2f63n1,squirrelpotpie,1 point,Tue Sep 2 03:24:35 2014 UTC,Hmmm. Can you install apps on your phone remotely from your computer like on Android phones? And isn't there a way to turn on find my iPhone remotely for cases like yours?
RBI,2f63n1,thetinguy,2,Mon Sep 1 16:39:29 2014 UTC,I don't think there's a way of locating it remotely if Find my iphone is turned off. I printed the screenshots and will go file a report now. Then wondering if I should ask the landlord if they know who it could be or who the person could be related to in the building?
RBI,2f63n1,twostrokeripper761,1 point,Mon Sep 1 16:45:32 2014 UTC,Police and emergency workers have more tools for phone location than phone owners do.  Never hurts to ask.
RBI,2f63n1,M3mph1s,1 point,Mon Sep 1 17:30:44 2014 UTC,Go to the police first maybe even a close by precinct to the location. Sometimes cops will remember the faces of the local fuck ups.
RBI,2f63n1,Divotus,3,Tue Sep 2 08:10:03 2014 UTC,"I'd print a hundred flyers with his picture that states, ""know this guy? These pictures were taken with a stolen device, guard your property"" and then I'd post them all over that building. Fuck that punk"
RBI,2f63n1,M3mph1s,3,Mon Sep 1 21:45:07 2014 UTC,"You mentioned tracking it. With the FB profile/pics and a name, you should be able to find exactly where he is. Knock on the door with a well written, professional-letterhead looking 'document' requesting the immoderate relinquishment of the phone. Don't overstep into impersonating or anything. The idea is deliver it by hand, tell them that this means give it back now or I'll proceed to the police. They look at a fancy lawyer-ey document, and decide it's not worth the trouble over a phone. Hopefully they'll be in shock that you even found them, and want to get rid of you. Make it clear if they return it, you'll wipe it and not involve the police, it's not a bad deal."
RBI,2f63n1,UglierThanMoe,15,Tue Sep 2 01:34:22 2014 UTC,I dont think you've ever been to Harlem.
RBI,2f63n1,Nagaempress,3,Mon Sep 1 22:48:59 2014 UTC,Fair enough. OPs local slipped my mind.
RBI,2f63n1,Balabol,6,Tue Sep 2 03:24:09 2014 UTC,"That's worth a try. But for sanity's sake, DON'T GO ALONE. Take a friend or two with you."
RBI,2f63n1,anonxo,1 point,Tue Sep 2 03:28:38 2014 UTC,Theft is theft and if the phone is worth over 500.00 its a felony. call the cops and then Update!
RBI,2f6hhb,z6joker9,8,Mon Sep 1 16:39:45 2014 UTC,Possibly Anita Joy Logan 1967-1984? I'm going to PM you the whitepages result that I found via Ancestry to that for potential parents' names.
RBI,2f6hhb,aftiggerintel,3,Mon Sep 1 18:26:12 2014 UTC,Try posting this in the Genealogy reddit. Those people can dig up all kinds of info.
RBI,2f6hhb,3006MA,0,Sat Sep 6 14:25:41 2014 UTC,Have you tried asking the police?  I've heard they sometimes get involved when there's a theft.
RBI,2f6hhb,whyamisosoftinthemid,2,Mon Sep 1 17:11:41 2014 UTC,"We haven't, but not sure which department we'd want to contact (since we're not sure of the city/county it was taken) or even if they would care about something from 15+ years ago that probably wasn't filed."
RBI,2f6hhb,whyamisosoftinthemid,3,Mon Sep 1 17:35:04 2014 UTC,Just call the non-emergency number at your local PD and ask.  The worst that can happen is that you make no progress.
RBI,2f0teh,socalitguy,24,Sat Aug 30 18:20:44 2014 UTC,I'd print up a few thousand copies and distribute them throughout the neighborhood. Those shoes should be pretty recognizable.
RBI,2f0teh,rivalarrival,5,Sat Aug 30 18:52:23 2014 UTC,"yeah, I was thinking of canvassing the neighborhood asking about this guy..."
RBI,2f0teh,sd4473,3,Sun Aug 31 03:34:19 2014 UTC,I think the black belt should be emphasized upon when searching for this crook.
RBI,2f0teh,sparrklez,21,Sat Aug 30 23:18:10 2014 UTC,"Postal clerk here, if this happened with parcels from the post office, definitely contact the postal inspectors as well. Send them these pics too!  https://postalinspectors.uspis.gov/investigations/MailFraud/fraudschemes/mailtheft/MailTheft.aspx"
RBI,2f0teh,GreatBabu,7,Sat Aug 30 22:08:35 2014 UTC,Postal service doesn't fuck around.   I'd order something USPS just to set this thief up.
RBI,2f0teh,sparrklez,11,Sat Aug 30 23:26:25 2014 UTC,Oh yeah. Usps definitely jumps on stuff that is reported stolen. One of the things they are good for
RBI,2f0teh,blindmelonade,6,Sat Aug 30 23:41:54 2014 UTC,Came here to say this as well. My supervisor is always on the phone with the inspectors because of missing packages and such. They'll interview the carriers and go from there.
RBI,2f0teh,Jewllz,10,Sat Aug 30 23:59:37 2014 UTC,Wow that is just so bold. He may in fact live near by and if he sees the mail or courier truck pull up he goes and helps himself a bit later.
RBI,2f0teh,creepn1,3,Sat Aug 30 22:03:03 2014 UTC,postal employee stopped by around 1:30pm... this guy came about an hour and a half later our neighbor has lived there for many years and knows tons of te neighborhood people personally. he said he's never seen this guy...
RBI,2f0teh,MadLintElf,11,Sun Aug 31 03:33:50 2014 UTC,Sounds like a good time to place that large order of africanized honey bees.
RBI,2f0teh,Decoy77,4,Sun Aug 31 12:54:06 2014 UTC,"I like, actually love how you think.  Then post the video on /r/JusticePorn ."
RBI,2f0teh,rivalarrival,3,Sun Aug 31 18:05:37 2014 UTC,"I hope he gets caught.  I had to get a PO box for my package deliveries after a package got stolen.  Peace of mind, even if it is a bit inconvenient."
RBI,2f0teh,Decoy77,2,Sun Aug 31 00:32:22 2014 UTC,"Get a UPS or other commercial box. USPS post office boxes can only receive USPS deliveries, and you have to deal with all the bulk-rate advertisements. UPS stores will notify you by email whenever you get a package, sign for deliveries, etc. They're much easier to work with than the post office."
RBI,2f0teh,Nate1n22,2,Mon Sep 1 20:25:41 2014 UTC,"Good to know about UPS. My local PO lets you use a street address with your PO box number and the unit number as a workaround for companies that won't accept a PO box as an address when ordering online.  However, I find using the address delays me getting the package.  Also, USPS has ""real mail"" email notifications but it could be just a piece of junk mail there, they don't differentiate."
RBI,2f0teh,nellirn,10,Mon Sep 1 20:34:47 2014 UTC,Put a fake box out there with some sort of GPS tracking in it.  Follow him and kick his ass.
RBI,2f0teh,piss_n_boots,1 point,Sun Aug 31 15:40:38 2014 UTC,"First, print this entire thread and place it inside the box with the tracking device. Just for giggles."
RBI,2f0teh,warren2650,3,Mon Sep 8 17:26:43 2014 UTC,What camera did you set up? No doubt he took those to a car -- if you intend to stung him maybe you can setup a second camera facing the street in hopes of capturing details of his vehicle?
RBI,2f0teh,warren2650,1 point,Fri Sep 5 06:51:51 2014 UTC,"Make yourself a package that looks like it was delivered by UPS.  Inside, put a cell phone with the GPS on it.  Then, when he takes it home and opens the package you'll get all the tracking information you need.  Call the police, show them the photos, the address etc and have him arrested. Unfortunately, after this you're going to have to move because he's going to fuck with you forever."
RBI,2f0teh,puhleez420,1 point,Mon Sep 8 13:30:25 2014 UTC,Also get yourself a locking delivery box.

RBI,2f0teh,muzz3256,1 point,Thu Nov 13 22:09:38 2014 UTC,"Observations:   28.08. was a Thursday therefore he probably doesn't work 9-5. Good outfit/hair, probably in contact with people at work. Right hand is not tanned (Probably glove.)   Theories:    Looks like he either works a job in the office and is gardening as a hobby or its actually his job. He uses a glove on his right hand but not his left. The way he 'regrabs' (lift up instead of slide down) the packet makes me think he is handling boxes like this moreoften.   Questions:   Do you use only one glove at golf? Is he left handed? When does a Gardener work?"
