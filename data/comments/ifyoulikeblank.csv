ifyoulikeblank,3e0v47,GreatWhiteToyShark,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:46:46 2015 UTC,"As u/Amital45 said, pretty much any Coen Brothers movie has some similarities in style to True Grit. In addition to Miller's Crossing, the other two that most remind me of True Grit are No Country For Old Men and Blood Simple, though both are set in the present.  You would also probably like The Assassination of Jesse James By the Coward Robert Ford, another newer western with a great dynamic between the two main characters. And your description of the settings makes me think you might like Terrence Malick. His films don't have the same kind of dialogue, but the idea of the characters being small compared to their world is strongly present. Check out Days of Heaven or The New World.  I think the most similar work I've encountered to True Grit, though, is the novel The Sisters Brothers. It's also a dark comedy western, and the language and sense of humor are a lot like those in True Grit."

Maine rapper who raps about the everyday things of the average guy. Give ""We Smoked it All 2"" and ""The Audacity!"" a shot.  HaHa-Yo. They are super frat but they are a good listen for a party jam or two. Check out ""Hey."" I reccommend Sundress and I play Lacrosse.  G-Eazy. I've only listened to ""These Things Happen"" and it's a smooth listen. He's got a lot of great features on it.  Chris Webby. He's known for his references to video games and other 90s stuff. Check out ""Webster's Laboratory"". That's his best work IMO.  Curren$y is another hard worker. He's constantly putting stuff out and it never fails to be great. Check out any of the Pilot Talks.  Also if you really like Bino's recent work then check out Yelawolf's Love Story. It's a mix of hip hop, country, blues and rock. It's a lot like Bino's recent stuff with the heavy emotions and story."

Watch it!  I've just started Rectify and it seems to be in the same vein. The main complaint it gets is that it's too ""slow"" for some people, but that's what I like about it - the focus is on character development rather than nonstop action.  The Wire and The Americans are both great shows, but the focus is on crime-solving/espionage, which sounds like it's not quite what you're looking for if you want more of a ""people living life in the modern world"" show."
ifyoulikeblank,3dw65p,AlbrechtEinstein,8,Mon Jul 20 03:49:39 2015 UTC,The focus of the Wire is not crime-solving at all.  It's incredibly in depth and character/environment based.

ifyoulikeblank,3dsrqf,Tukajo,4,Sun Jul 19 02:39:43 2015 UTC,"The name given to the jazz/classical crossover music that you're referring to is third stream which might be worth reading up on it if you have the time. Listed by artist/album/song:  *Dave Brubeck Quartet - Bernstein Plays Brubeck Plays Bernstein - Dialogues for Jazz Combo and Orchestra (Allegro). The album is split into 2 parts with the first half being the Dialogues for Jazz Combo and Orchestra (4 movements) and the second half being arrangements of songs from the musicals West Side Story and Wonderful Town. It also features the New York Philharmonic.  *Dave Brubeck Quartet - Time Changes - Elementals. This song fits your request and at 16 minutes long, it's plenty to be getting on with on its own. The rest of the album is cool jazz which might not be what you're after.  *Jacques Loussier Trio - Vivaldi: The Four Seasons - No. 1 in E major, RV 269 ""La primavera"". The Trio is known for this kind of music and is most notable for reworking Bach on several albums such as The Bach Book. They have also reworked Handel, Ravel and Satie."

I was a huge fan of Fringe, and 12 Monkeys is the only sci-fi show I've seen since Fringe ended that I thought was nearly as good.  I've also been watching Wayward Pines on Fox.  It's nothing special, but it's sort of similar to the stuff you mentioned.  I haven't read the books, so I couldn't tell you how it compares to those.  For comics, you might like Locke & Key.  It's got sort of a creepy horror vibe to it.  I hadn't heard of American Elsewhere until now, but it sounds sort of interesting.  I may have to check that one out."
