GoldenSun,3crn5s,Thetanor,3,Fri Jul 10 05:38:46 2015 UTC,"So, the Miiverse Art Academy community was severely lacking in Golden Sun content, so I decided to make an effort and draw some Golden Sun things.  I started with drawing Isaac and based this off the familiar official artwork that I think everyone here has probably seen. What do you think?  I'll probably be sticking to recreating characters from official artwork, as its nice to have a reference pic to look at. But when I've gathered some confidence I might try to make something more original.  Who would you like to see next? (Personally, I'm thinking of taking a shot at Saturos)"
GoldenSun,3crn5s,Jadonson,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:43:14 2015 UTC,"Adding onto it, how about some Djinni? It would be interesting to see all of them in color."
GoldenSun,3crn5s,Jadonson,2,Fri Jul 10 06:15:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a great idea, I should definitely do the Djinns as well!  One good thing about them is that I can also make them all fit in a single image and don't have to turn them sideways... :P"
GoldenSun,3crn5s,Jadonson,2,Fri Jul 10 09:25:55 2015 UTC,"And here's my first go at Djinns. Not going to make a new post of it, since really it's just a Mars Djinni making friends with a tomato... :P"

I got the game myself just the other day, and felt it was obligatory to post my tomato too, but I felt like it needed something special to stand out.

Serious: there's so little Golden Sun artwork that anything would be fantastic. Specifically, the lighthouses/Sol Sanctum and other architectures are beautiful. Character-wise, I think the most interest designs are adult Isaac, Sveta, and Karis. You guys already mentioned djinn, but the summons are great too."
GoldenSun,3crn5s,cloudnixus,2,Fri Jul 10 11:45:49 2015 UTC,"Haha :D  Adult Isaac is definitely on the list for upcoming characters, I really like his design :) And the architecture/locations is a great suggestion!  I'm hoping to one day be skilled enough to tackle more complicated  things like summons. And my dream would be that I could draw some of the memorable scenes of the games as original artworks.  But that's still way beyond me... Honestly, I was very impressed how well I managed to draw Isaac from reference, so more complex stuff is still ways off. You'll probably have to stand my official artwork recreations for a while still.  But one has to start somewhere :D"

Also, Camelot created 3D models of all the characters and enemies in the first two games, and then took screenshots of those models to use as sprites in-game.  Those assets are obviously unavailable, so all we have is a model from SSBB.  We will probably get some more models in DLC."

GoldenSun,3bqu08,zonine,3,Wed Jul 1 19:50:58 2015 UTC,...and they were destroyed because they are opposing elements? /iunno
GoldenSun,3bqu08,orangebomber,2,Thu Jul 2 05:52:19 2015 UTC,To be fair gameplay-wise Venus and Jupiter are the most fleshed out and the most non-descript. Mars is just fire and Mercury is just water and ice but Venus and Jupiter can be whatever they want and not just earth and wind. The elemental rivalries are the most apparent among these two as well.
GoldenSun,3bqu08,Ferdi265,2,Sun Jul 5 02:53:20 2015 UTC,"Also, the Venus and Jupiter clans are completely absent.  Mars has the Proxians, Mercury has multiple, the Lemurians and the water clan in Imil.  We never actually meet the Jupiter clan (the Anemos) are mentioned, but we never see much of them.  The absolute nonexistence of a Venus clan is even more mysterious.  And the fact that we only see Mars and Venus adepts around Mt. Aleph, which is supposed to be the center of alchemy as a whole, and not the center of Elements that are represented by warm colors, is also a bit strange.  I hope that the next game will answer some of these questions; especially the Question of the nonexistant Venus clan. Maybe a prequel? ""Seal alchemy in the lighthouses before it destroys us?"""

GoldenSun,3bfzzi,isaac3000,6,Sun Jun 28 22:04:56 2015 UTC,"What's preventing the game from having 12/16 playable characters, as in 3 or 4 teams?  If I am not mistaken the RPGs Camelot was making before Golden Sun were known for having lots of playable characters with varying importance depending on how they fit the story.  What I'm trying to say is, the set of characters doesn't have to be so fixed, precise and predictable.  What if any previously featured character could join your party at some point, or then leave at some point if it fits the story (without having to think if the teams are planned thoroughly etc)...or heck imagine if you got to a point where you could choose which of 2 same-element adepts joins your team and which goes do some other errand instead etc.  But anyway, if it did boil down to having 3 or 4 teams, I'd expect: -team from DD (returning at some point) -new typical team (kids of Felix' team) -4 new ""distant"" story-related characters (proxian, Takeru, Ahri..) -the secondary team from DD (or these showing up as NPCs if 3 teams)"
GoldenSun,3bfzzi,SaiphCharon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"In all honesty I kind of want there to be some options available to the player in regards to the storyline. A lot of the times in GS, whenever they ask the player something and the player can respond in a couple ways, it has zero impact on the story, or one prevents the story from advancing; essentially forcing the player to choose the other option.   I want things to get intense. Make this into a full out RPG with a lot of characters, different NPCs who can be ally or enemy. Choices you make could potentially kill your teammates for good.  I know it might not be in true Camelot style, but I think that it could make for a strong finish for the series."
GoldenSun,3bfzzi,Alsenis,2,Mon Jun 29 01:23:33 2015 UTC,"I hope they take the idea from TLA and allow you to bring the party from the first installment into your group. In this case, have a party of 8 like DD, then bring in the rest from DD who aren't in the party. So essentially having a lot of characters, like SaiphonCharon said.   Although, perhaps a smaller party would be best, considering I didn't even use Reif and Himi(?) in DD."
GoldenSun,3bfzzi,Chocobose,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:15:21 2015 UTC,"I think the main party will include at least one child of TLA's team (Felix and Sheba's child?), and Riefs sister. I'd also like to have playable light and dark adepts. Other than that don't care much about the rest of the team. Maybe possibly have the jupiter adept be someone from anemos, and have the ability to go there"

GoldenSun,3b32nw,drupido,3,Thu Jun 25 17:19:50 2015 UTC,Whats wrong with sword users inherently? They all play very differently (except for the Marths)
GoldenSun,3b32nw,BloodChicken,8,Thu Jun 25 21:47:14 2015 UTC,"At first when supporting Isaac, we had to deal with people thinking he is just a sword user. Some most probably think this.  Now, to simplify when I have to explain, I just say he's an earthbender."
GoldenSun,3b32nw,_Falgor_,3,Fri Jun 26 01:26:13 2015 UTC,Perfect description.
GoldenSun,3b32nw,BloodChicken,3,Fri Jun 26 01:50:43 2015 UTC,"Trust me I know, i even designed a moveset way back when he was a rumor for brawl. He could (and would) be an awesome character and my main most likely. Perception in non-fans of golden sun would be he is just a sword user though... That's what worries me most."
GoldenSun,3b32nw,drupido,3,Fri Jun 26 02:28:05 2015 UTC,That's why we're here to explain the truth! ;) I also tried to make a moveset for him recently and he would without a shadow of a doubt be my main.
GoldenSun,3b32nw,_Falgor_,6,Fri Jun 26 02:31:59 2015 UTC,Let's keep supporting our favorite Adept until October! Right now a lot of people have the feeling Isaac is the next #Smashified character. It'll help! :)  The Sun will rise again!
GoldenSun,3b32nw,_Falgor_,3,Fri Jun 26 01:27:50 2015 UTC,"I voted for him in the ballot! I'd main the shit out of him. So far, Shulk's been my main."

But he can trade that 'psynergy' to do more less powerful moves. That way it'll kind of feel like playing golden sun when playing him."

GoldenSun,3b32nw,Thetanor,2,Sat Jun 27 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"I'm reluctant to get my hopes up too much, but yes, I think that we've got a decent chance that Isaac gets in as DLC.   He's not an AT, but Golden Sun as a series is still present as two songs. In most unofficial ballots I've seen, Isaac seems to be in the top 5, sometimes even in top 3, and at the very least in top 10. He'd be mechanically rather unique, even if some people think he's overshadowed by Swordsies and Robin. Golden Sun is after all one of the most critically acclaimed GBA games, and one of the few prominent RPGs on Nintendo platforms. Personally, I'd say the most prominent one with no current Smash reps.  [EDIT: Although fiercely contested by the Bravely series (Default and the upcoming Second for the 3DS), which is probably more on the surface as of now. However, Golden Sun has ""seniority"" between them. Besides a Bravely rep would be somewhat unlikely considering that it is a Square Enix property.] Both GBA games are available on Wii U VC, so the series has already got some presence on Nintendo's current platforms. Adding Isaac as a fighter could only increase their sales, possibly revitalizing interest in the series. (Not saying that it has really died that much. Even Dark Dawn being a little lackluster sold some 700k copies. However, it's been almost five years and a little boost would be nice anyway.) Also, since DS games are currently coming to VC, Nintendo could have all three GS games available on the same platform! Talk about synergy! ( No pun intended ;) )   All in all, the odds seem to be in Isaac's favour. Let's hope for the best."
GoldenSun,3b32nw,IAMhippo12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:35:33 2015 UTC,"Great post! I agree with all of your points, which is why I believe Isaac is pretty much a given at this point. Plus, Sakurai said he wants to make the fans happy, and the fans want Isaac. It's kind of a no-brainer.  The only way I could see him not being included is if Sakurai couldn't come up with a unique moveset for him, which would be ridiculous considering how much potential Isaac has."
GoldenSun,3b32nw,mcreeves,2,Thu Jul 2 14:56:38 2015 UTC,Holy crap! I would buy smash 4 for Isaac. Another suggestion i saw was that the different costumes would be felix and matthew.
GoldenSun,3b32nw,_Falgor_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:01:46 2015 UTC,"Calling it now, his final smash will be Meggido"
GoldenSun,3b32nw,Aceofspade159,2,Fri Jun 26 01:20:41 2015 UTC,"Haha, Isaac could have a dozen of Final Smashes. x) I'd bet his FS would be Judgment.  Edit: My reasoning is that a Final Smash is supposed to be the most impressive and powerful move of a character, and since Judgment is pretty much that (When staying in the Venus element at least) when other moves/Psynergy are spammable... Also, it's difficult to bring something more awesome than Judgment, arguably."
GoldenSun,3b32nw,Kalustar,3,Fri Jun 26 01:24:28 2015 UTC,Ragnarok would look pretty cool
GoldenSun,3b32nw,BloodChicken,3,Fri Jun 26 02:22:13 2015 UTC,That should be his b move
GoldenSun,3b32nw,IAMhippo12,3,Fri Jun 26 08:14:48 2015 UTC,Odyssey would look better. Odyssey for FS!
GoldenSun,3b32nw,Thetanor,3,Fri Jun 26 08:55:43 2015 UTC,"I think his FS should be that he slowly flies upward as all the djinns swirling around him, and then summons judgement to blow everyblody off the stage.  Here's hoping! fingers crossed"
GoldenSun,3b32nw,_Falgor_,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:58:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like Odyssey might be a better fit for his FS mechanically. Here's how it could work:   Two psynergy swords come in diagonally from up and down, locking any opponent(s) standing in front of Isaac in place and dealing decent damage. A giant sword zooms across the stage, launching any opponents that get hit with great force (think Ganon's FS). Anyone locked down by the initial swords is surely hit, other players may attempt to dodge or just move out of the way.   Not saying that Judgment wouldn't be totally awesome, I just think that Odyssey is mechanically more viable."
GoldenSun,3b32nw,Thetanor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:55:42 2015 UTC,"The problem with Odyssey is that the move personally makes me think more of Felix than Isaac. Not that it's technically a problem but well... It would then be quite strange for him to have both Ragnarok and Odyssey in his moveset.  Imo, Judgment would work like Cpt. Falcon or Megaman's FS: You'd have to touch one or more opponent with it, and if you manage to do it, it launches the cutscene just like in the game. Judgment fires his blast, yada yada, everyone dies, Isaac wins. x)  Anyway like you said, it would only be a small disappointment if his FS wasn't Judgment. The only thing I need is to have Isaac playable. ;)"
GoldenSun,3b32nw,IAMhippo12,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"True, Odyssey is probably a little more Felix-y. Though I don't think that having Isaac use both Ragnarok as a special and Odyssey as his FS would be a problem, since Ike already has both Aether as his up-B and Great Aether as his FS.  As for Judgment, you are right, it could definitely be made a FS à la Cpt. Falcon/Megaman/Shulk, though personally I don't really like that style of ""cinematic"" Final Smashes as much. EDIT: Though imagine that Isaac's FS would be chosen from among a bunch of different high level summons: usually it's Judgment but sometimes it'd be something different, say, another level 4 summon or one of the special ""mega summons"" from TLA. I'd totally dig that, too!  But yeah, I don't really mind that much what Isaac's FS or moveset would be. He has some great options and I'm sure that Sakurai and the team can really make something great out of those. As long as we get a Golden Sun main protagonist as a Smash rep, be it Isaac, Matthew or even Felix, I'd be one happy fanboy :)"
GoldenSun,3b32nw,Thetanor,1 point,Fri Jul 3 11:46:44 2015 UTC,You mean like Link's FS but plus two more swords?
GoldenSun,3b32nw,IAMhippo12,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:59:31 2015 UTC,"No, I mean quite literally this.  Just imagine that the Minos Warrior is an opposing fighter, and the area around is the stage."
GoldenSun,3b32nw,Thetanor,1 point,Sun Jul 5 08:42:47 2015 UTC,"That helps a lot. I haven't played in a while. That psynergy is definitely dramatic enough, although it would act like Link's Final Smash. Right?"
GoldenSun,3b32nw,IAMhippo12,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:13:55 2015 UTC,"Yea, in that the initial two swords would pin one (or more) opponent down like the triforce does.  But how I imagine it, the final huge sword would just move across the stage, able to hit other fighters on the way as it strikes the opponent pinned down.  EDIT: Edited for clarity"
GoldenSun,3b32nw,BarbieEffect,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:48:54 2015 UTC,That would be pretty sweet.
GoldenSun,3b32nw,_Falgor_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:56:15 2015 UTC,"But Golden Sun has less representation in Smash 4 than in Brawl. Isaac is no longer an Assist Trophy, but he gets one extra song on Palutena's Temple. It's only something i read on an old thread a couple of months ago, but it said there's also less Golden Sun stickers.  Unless Isaac was taken out in order to be put in as an extra character, in which case everything i wrote is useless..."
GoldenSun,3ayzri,Coaltergeist,3,Wed Jun 24 17:08:22 2015 UTC,"The lack of that distinct buzzing noise typical in 8-bit music is kind of uncanny since we're all so used it, but the quality is undeniable. In particular, the bass sounds much better now because you can actually hear it! In all the other versions I've listened to, it's covered up by the distortion/buzzing/static.  Some comments on individual tracks:   In Sol Sanctum there seems to be more reverb in the other version. This is most noticeable if you listen to the snares in the background. Your mix sounds a bit dry overall, but I'm not sure if that's just mp3 compression artifacts or an actual difference in mixing. IIRC sharp attacks like drums tend to be smeared out under mp3 compression. In the other version of Vale at 0:28, the synth stands out a bit more from the background. But maybe the buzzing is just covering up the bass?   It's hard to tell what is ""correct"" here since technically your mixes are the ""originals"", and they should be different from what's already out there. On the other hand, the composer probably took into account how it would sound on a tiny GBA speaker, so it wasn't meant to sound like this anyways.  Also, this might not matter but do you know what the ""correct"" sample rate native to GBA is? I've seen 8000 Hz to 65536 Hz to all sorts of other weird numbers, but pretty sure 44.1 kHz is not native, meaning you would have to resample."
GoldenSun,3ayzri,minares,2,Wed Jun 24 20:03:23 2015 UTC,"Ooookay I'm gonna take a shot in the dark with regards to sample rate; because I'm not playing this music out of the GBA speakers, I don't think that it matters. I'm exporting them as .wav files, which means that I'm trying to make them at the highest possible quality and therefore the highest possible rate. Due to the way I extracted the audio to ""rerecord"" the songs, the larger rate SHOULDN'T matter. Once again this is all a shot in the dark, I could be wrong.  As for the two songs, thanks for the input! Gonna try to fix both of those problems."

This one is too... soft in its picture. It's hard to express. Also the deep synth noises from 0:38 to 0:47 may be a bit too overwhelming, they sound weird. Still great, but I miss this feeling of being in a sacred, forbidden, oppressing lighthouse. Maybe more accent on the drums's resonance..? I don't exactly know. Again, still great.  Sol Sanctum : Not much to say, it's the same but a lot cleaner. Great work.  Vale : Great."

I think Camelot could put an end to the storyline quite well if they really put time into the game, as well as added new battle mechanics.   In short, it can be done. Camelot just needs the write incentive. Only way to do it is to show them we want another one."

It completely destroyed any sense of exploration that the previous games thrived off of."
GoldenSun,3atw31,Coaltergeist,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:20:34 2015 UTC,"Like I said, they made some changes and they didn't all pay off. It has better storytelling than GS1 and 2, albeit there is too much dialogue. And just because there are PONRs doesn't mean it isn't a GS game.  Yeah, it isn't as good as GS2. That's a given. If you take a good, hard look at GS1, you might be persuaded into thinking that DD is better in the gameplay department than the original, but it also came out nearly 10 years later. Overall it is a damn fine (and FUN) RPG, well-deserving of the 8/10s (good/great) that it got."
GoldenSun,3atw31,Animedingo,-1,Wed Jun 24 15:31:06 2015 UTC,"7/10 at the most, it was way less fun Imho than the original golden sun. Frankly I liked the original gs more than lost age  Dark dawns biggest crime was losing the tone of golden sun game. Aside from tgw combat system, I can barely call it golden sun. It was an enormous disappointment.   Lets not forget about its atrociously poorly paced team system. Instead of giving you 2 teams of 4. They slowly gave you one party member at a time, I never even bothered with half the characters because the last 3 were given to me in such a rush that I had an established team already. And its not like they were return characters like the original gs team, they were pretty much all new ones"

You talk like if DD was a piece of crap just because, even if the GBA games were obviously excellent, you overestimate them too much. Dark Dawn was fine. Golden Sun isn't like the Bible, it's not good to the point it's something sacred and ""omg you must not do something less good or else we'll all die"".  And even worse, you're just being a fun killer for the ones desperate to see at least the end of the story, and actively working to build hype for the game.  Yes, I'm pissed by people saying they don't want GS4. You have no idea.  Edit: Just try to imagine me saying I hope the series (tv, games or whatever you want) you like the most is cancelled because I think the last season/game/etc. was not as good as the first.

Also I was around level 27-29 when I beat the game. In TLA you'll be around that level when you meet up with Isaac and his crew give or take a couple levels.

GoldenSun,3afmup,Coaltergeist,3,Fri Jun 19 19:12:46 2015 UTC,"wow. extracting procedurally generated audio sounds like a real bitch, but it sounds like you did a terrific job of it! I can see why you would need virtual instruments. (btw, the two files you uploaded look identical to me: MD5 - 4379659A8D111E2B68EF9D297CBB963E. Mistake? or maybe that track was a bad example?)  Haha, and it looks like I'm just as perfectionist as you, because I'd be itching with anything less than a lossless rip. Soooo looking forward to this, but take your time and make it good! :D"
GoldenSun,3afmup,minares,3,Fri Jun 19 23:38:17 2015 UTC,"Are you referring to the 2 dropbox files? I assure you that the synths are different (in ways I'll get to next week), but if you can't tell the difference, then that makes my job easier. Assuming you think it sounds similar/identical to the original, that is :)  As for extracting the MIDIs themselves, if not for this annoying but necessary synth debacle, I would have had the project done like 2 months ago. Running the Music Riper honestly takes like 2 minutes if you know your way around command prompt, a bit more if you aren't on Windows. Maybe after this big undertaking I'll post a short tutorial, so you can use it with other games, eh?  EDIT: Maybe a better example would be An Adept's Home?  ""Bad"" Synth  ""Good"" Synth"
GoldenSun,3afmup,minares,3,Sat Jun 20 00:10:22 2015 UTC,"No, I mean the two files of ""Fusion Dragon"" are identical, bit for bit exactly the same.

GoldenSun,3a226m,Chocobose,14,Tue Jun 16 16:55:18 2015 UTC,"The best chance we've got is for Isaac to rate high enough on the character poll that he gets put into Smash Bros. This will both signify a persisting interest in the series, AND kickstart new recognition of the game for anyone that plays SSB. Kinda like why they made him an assist trophy in the first place, but with more power behind it because fighters get more face time."
GoldenSun,3a226m,td260,6,Tue Jun 16 17:49:33 2015 UTC,"I guess. But we already got Roy and Ryu, and as far as Twitter has been saying, nobody wanted Ryu. So it seems Nintendo doesn't care all that much."
GoldenSun,3a226m,RaIshtar,11,Tue Jun 16 18:24:32 2015 UTC,The Smash ballot is still open and will only close in October. THEN we'll have characters from it.
GoldenSun,3a226m,td260,8,Tue Jun 16 19:57:19 2015 UTC,"The difference is that Roy and Ryu were not part of the character ballot. The character ballot finishes in October, and only after that point can we think about Isaac returning. Until then, any and all DLC characters will be ones that Nintendo came up with on their own."
GoldenSun,3a226m,Animedingo,1 point,Tue Jun 16 20:59:30 2015 UTC,"This was just the first release of voted smash dlc characters.   They wanted to accomplish two things, one, show that they're willing to bring back old characters, and that they don't have to be Nintendo characters. Roy and Ryu accomplished this, and their names sound similar, so there's that. As far as their popularity...Hard to say. It's possible the bar for whether or not a character gets their attention is very low, and that they just choose themselves who comes out when. Basically what I'm saying is, the character's popularity does not determine when it comes out. Isaac could have more popularity than Ryu for Smash, but it was better for Ryu to come out before Isaac.   I suspect the next wave of DLC characters, Isaac or not, will be two new characters entirely, no returning ones. The best thing we can do, honestly, buy the DLC characters. Show them that we're willing to buy these new characters so they're encouraged to do more.   I wasn't really interested in Ryu, but I bought him to encourage the voting system, and I actually really like playing as him. His combo moves work really well in the Smash format."

GoldenSun,3a226m,td260,3,Tue Jun 16 22:08:26 2015 UTC,"Ideally, Isaac would get into smash and Camelot uses the popularity to launch a new game that wraps everything up. This isn't the most realistic viewpoint, but it's the optimistic one I choose to take."
GoldenSun,3a226m,Dracobolt,2,Wed Jun 17 01:32:43 2015 UTC,Yeah... Isaac in Smash and a game that ties up DD's loose ends. And maybe in the future they can confine their stories to single game installments so that less will ride on the success of a first part. And single-game stories also are more fulfilling for players and so people will like them more.
GoldenSun,3a226m,td260,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:00:07 2015 UTC,"Honestly the problem with Dark Dawn was that it was doomed from the ideological conception- they tried to make it into both a sequel capitalizing on the success of the first two games, (i.e. Isaac&Co with their children) while trying to expand/retcon the original lore of the world. This ends up with a bit of a train wreck where Camelot, (who usually rely heavily on their worldbuilding) built a world that was interesting, and chronologically impossible; having massive civilizations rise up in a short period of time, etc. The retcon they did regarding the ancient civilizations I don't really mind that much, (though my memory of Dark Dawn is beginning to fade a bit) but the part that drove me up a wall is that all of this was found, inhabited and expanded within 30 years.     Dark Dawn would have been a much better title as a spiritual successor, ""in the world of Weyard"" instead of being a 30 year time skip. Granted, it would not have solved the difficulty issues, nor the pacing/PONR problems and the lack of characterization, but it would have allowed us once again to immerse ourselves into a world that we want to learn more about instead of trying to cope with the conflicting timeframes. These issues would have been fixed with a bit more polish, but I feel as though they sacrificed a lot of the development time to trying to figure out what direction the story was going in."
GoldenSun,3a226m,_Falgor_,2,Wed Jun 17 05:04:14 2015 UTC,"Just an interesting point someone made someday: The new cities are maybe not ""new"". In the GBA games, we explore an entire world, and there's still less than 100 places. It's not much, isn't it?  The explanation is simple: There was more cities and places, but we never visited them because it wasn't useful to the story. Add to this the fact that Weyard is also changing because of the return of Alchemy, and boom, it's perfectly logical."
GoldenSun,3a226m,td260,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:52:54 2015 UTC,Except for the fact that a fair number of the cities straight up said that they were built within the past 30 years.  Like how Belinsk talked about how the ruins were unearthed during the Golden Sun Event and they built the city on top of them.     Or how in 30 years enough people became beastmen that they formed 2-3 warring nations with cities and governments.
GoldenSun,3a226m,_Falgor_,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:00:47 2015 UTC,"The cities are not exactly meant to be very big, though. And in a world where Psynergy exists, a lot of things are possible. Seeking the absolute logic in a video game, well... That's not the point, I think."
GoldenSun,3a226m,Wbalmung,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"With an event as significant as the Golden Sun rising, that could definitely kick some politics into action. Cities that previously might not care about anyone else would find themselves more willing to fight with more psynergy."

That still doesn't mean it was perfect. I still hold it in a special place though. No one thought we were going to get a continuation after TLA."

GoldenSun,3a226m,lancol,3,Tue Jun 16 21:19:30 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree. DD wasn't really as bad as everyone was giving it credit for.

Maybe it wasn't the best, but it definitely wasn't worse than NO golden sun game in its place.  I don't hear people saying they pretend it doesn't exist like Matrix 3 or Star Wars Christmas Special, just that it wasn't as great as they hoped."
GoldenSun,3a226m,_Falgor_,6,Thu Jun 18 02:49:12 2015 UTC,"Well given that Camelot makes the mario tennis games, I'd say it's still a no go for Golden Sun yet again."

I'm looking forward to the full release!  In your previous post you said it was ""90% done"". Is it actually that close?"
GoldenSun,39bw91,NickNack4EvahBra,3,Thu Jun 11 01:15:32 2015 UTC,"That was a rough estimate. There are approximately 90 tracks from both games (no bonus tracks), and I also included the time that I spent making the artwork and the album itself. I don't know for sure, but I'd estimate that there are about 15 songs left to finalize. Keep in mind that it took a while to do what I've already done, but I'm decently confident I'll have it done before July."

GoldenSun,398l4k,PokerusVGMusic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 18:11:46 2015 UTC,"I could compare this to saturos02's covers of the songs.  The fusion dragon section is amazing with the electric guitar. The doom dragon lead isn't loud enough and it isn't as good as the detuned PWM synth that saturos02 used, I feel. The extra chords in between the songs were excellent, and the intro to doom dragon was amazing. The repetition of that one chord during doom dragon was unneccesary and detracted from the song I feel, however. The base was dead perfect the entire time, and that's what I see people failing when they attempt it. Good job. I've noticed that alot of the songs in your album have similar problems, Godlike intros, Amazing base tracks, and fair to pretty bad leads simply because the wrong instrument for the job is used. One of the best lead jobs you did was with Dreadbeard's hidden path. The lead was 9/10 the entire time, simply because you missed/took out alot of the cooler notes. The Formina Sage is by far my favorite track in your album, even though for a fairly large part of the song it fails at the lead.  9/10"

If you're using Lachesis' Rule on Mia consider Feathered Robe and Leda's Bracelet, especially if you look into classes, this works well if you swap most of ivan and mia's Djinn to put them both in seer class, for stats, 2 wish's, 2 impacts, strong offensive jupiter psynergy etc. Both would have leda's and feathered robes.

The classes in the front were set up to optimize physical attack power, while also giving Piers Pure Wish. Equipment was also set up to optimize unleash rate. One person has the 99% unleash rate setup, while the others in front also have that, but minus the Valkyrie Mail (because there is only one).  I did this mainly to deal with Doom Dragon after he djinn stormed both halves of my party. I actually found Doom Dragon to be harder than Dullahan, because summon rushes will take Dully out pretty quickly, while they don't work as well against Doom. This is because summon damage scales with the targets HP, but Doom's HP is split into three parts, so summons only scale to about a third of Doom's HP."

GoldenSun,37ve7v,redditbutblueit,7,Sat May 30 18:45:57 2015 UTC,"I think you're just personally experiencing this burn out. Your interests might be changing or your older self has realized that it doesn't really enjoy the Golden Sun formula. And that's perfectly fine! While I think that Dark Dawn is not as good as the first two games, it still had enough of that GS feel to keep me hooked through the entire game, twice. But that's just me-- I really enjoy the turn-based battle style of games like GS, Pokemon, and Final Fantasy.   As for why Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest don't ""peeter out"", they actually do-- that's why new gameplay mechanics are consistently implemented in subsequent games. Final Fantasy XIII and XV are extremely different from the originals, in an attempt to give the series longevity. Dark Dawn is more of the same, so if you enjoy the battle system of the first two games, you'll enjoy DD as well. I think the biggest thing that makes DD a chore is the end-game, which hits a huge slow point with little story development, which is just a game-design flaw.  EDIT: Also, don't underestimate the power of nostalgia when it comes to the games we enjoy. We could literally be playing a horrible game, but if it brings back memories of good times, we will continue to enjoy those games, even if they are poorly designed."
GoldenSun,37ve7v,AgentLym,8,Sat May 30 22:33:00 2015 UTC,"Camelot is a little team. Producing a RPG takes a long time, and it's not the only series they have to produce, since they have to work on the Mario Tennis/Golf, which also takes some time.  The fact that the two GBA games were so close is because they were made as one game. They had to split it because it was too huge for one cartridge. Then they worked a little bit more on The Lost Age, but since it was the same console, it was easier. Also the team was not as little back then.  Finally, Dark Dawn did sell well. Not as well as the GBA games, for various reasons: Not enough support from Nintendo, the RPG genre being less popular now, the 7 years gap between the games, even if not that huge, also played a role. Finally, it's easier to appreciate good things with child's eyes. :/"

GoldenSun,360cpv,_Falgor_,5,Fri May 15 00:51:55 2015 UTC,"So, I already knew about the first game of the series and the concept was really original, so when I saw a trailer for the new game, I watched it.  I was then surprised to see what I thought could be a reference to the pipes puzzles in Mercury Lighthouse in the first Golden Sun. Someone else in the comments had the same idea.  What do you think?"
GoldenSun,360cpv,Hyro22,4,Fri May 15 00:54:28 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are other games with similar pipe puzzles but GS is definitely what I think of first.

GoldenSun,360cpv,EnderOS,2,Fri May 15 14:09:59 2015 UTC,"Sadly I just like the concept, I never had the opportunity to actually play it. :( Though I remember reading a few reviews of the game, pointing some flaws, and the game is really short.

GoldenSun,360cpv,kuhmuh,2,Fri May 15 18:10:02 2015 UTC,"I played the first game. It's very short but I loved it. It has some flaws however, but it didn't bother me too much. The first half of the game is more about graphical enhancements while the second half is about different games. It's just a bit weird to play several types of RPGs in one game. Overall I would advise you to play it."

Summon rushing didn't work for me the first 5 times so I gave up on that. Summon damage is nerfed in this mod if you didn't already know. I forget what my djinn set up was but I had at least two revive adapts in each party. My strategy was to wing it without summon rushing and it took me 3 tries. I'd tell you the exact djinn setup if I didn't just restart and save over my pre dullahan slot by mistake when starting up hard mode this week.   Like the original though, you are pretty much screwed if you get bad djinn storm luck."

GoldenSun,35xcf2,XxLTxX,1 point,Fri May 15 06:23:55 2015 UTC,"Try using physical classes like Samurai, perhaps?

GoldenSun,35ss25,ExecutiveDave,3,Wed May 13 05:08:30 2015 UTC,"There's already a lot of theory behind how to best set up your djinni to get the best stats/psynergy possible, but any combinations that have at least 2 pure mages out of the 8 and 2 master/ronin are bound to be fairly strong.    I think the more relevant question is how you set up your usage of flash/shade/granite and potentially other useful djinni like kite, ground, luff (or rime, same effect), breeze, etc. such that your classes don't get screwed over.  In this sense, dual elemental classes are often more practical than tri-elementals even if they have lower overall stats and are missing one tree of psynergy."
GoldenSun,35ss25,synapsii,2,Wed May 13 08:23:03 2015 UTC,"I love class-building in GS; just one of the many fantastic RPG themes that these games nearly perfected. I like your setups.

Also 2 Ronin+1 master is stupid damage."

GoldenSun,35g1ow,_Falgor_,10,Sun May 10 00:21:32 2015 UTC,"I like the article until it came up with a mock moveset for Isaac. Whenever people do this I think they overcomplicate it and try to reference everything they can but the goal should be a unique and interesting moveset first, and references second Not every tilt and smash and air needs to be a psynergy or specific reference, I can't think of a single character in Smash that has this.  imo, tilts and airs don't need to be more than various sword attacks. Maybe following the movements of some unleashes but not necessary. Specials should definitely be psynergy like Gaia and Ragnarok (abilities that are commonly associated with Isaac and not random things such as items) and grab should be the iconic psynergy-hand. Throw in a Djinn of some kind (maybe Granite for a downB or Flint for a dash-attack) and you have a well-rounded, interesting character who represents the Golden Sun series without being bogged down by it.  But Matthew being an alt-costume for Isaac is a must."
GoldenSun,35g1ow,BloodChicken,6,Sun May 10 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"I think Felix would work better as an alt costume, kind of like Olimar and Alph, and would be a heads up to Lost Age fans, which IMO was the best GS game"
GoldenSun,35g1ow,crovansci,6,Sun May 10 18:34:41 2015 UTC,"Imo, it's the go-to link when you want to explain why Isaac is a no-brainer for Smash. Of course, since it's so complete, it's also pretty long, but if someone's actually interested, it's ideal."

GoldenSun,3572he,RigbyThePower,3,Thu May 7 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Combat will be split into multiple Zones, enemies and allies are put into random zones at the start of the fight.  Units take turns from highest AGI to lowest (With the exception of Priority moves)  And a turn consists of a Movement Phase, then an Action Phase.  The Movement Phase allows you to move from your zone to an adjacent zone, however, if the unit is outnumbered by enemies in their current zone, they must skip their Movement Phase because they are ""Locked"".  The Action Phase is the typical, attack an enemy in your zone, cast Psynergy, Djinn, Summons.  The majority of these only affect your current zone.  I'll know more after our first session but I'm expecting combat to be a very involved process, with party-wide strategies."

GoldenSun,353xzn,Floowey,4,Wed May 6 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"Alright, this is just my idea, but I hope it makes sense.  When someone in your party learns psynergy through an item, I always thought of it as a ""cheat"" to help them out. Take, for example, douse; most of the water adepts in the first 2 games could learn douse naturally, but you could facilitate ANY Adept's dousing abilities with the drop. Same with frost (at least for Piers) IIRC. My thoughts are that super high-level psynergy like hover and warp (not teleport, they are different abilities mind you) would be theoretically obtainable normally, but Alex is a much more skilled (and older) Adept that has been confirmed (at least in the Japanese version) to have received direct training from Mia's father.  That's the only explanation I have besides ""He learned it from his time in Prox,"" but there's no credence to that theory."
GoldenSun,353xzn,Coaltergeist,3,Wed May 6 22:26:00 2015 UTC,"Don't forget Alex knew about (SPOILERS) the golden sun being able to grant him power to basically make him as powerful as the wise one. So he already knows somethings about psynergy that pretty much nobody else does. If I remember, the proxians aren't aware of his motives questioning him at some point in the game, while Kraden relied on a hunch he doubted himself."
GoldenSun,353xzn,AfroAlchemist,2,Thu May 7 02:02:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he must have learned some hidden secret from his father or worked it out himself. He's probably pretty gosh-darned powerful; it's always implied he would kick your party's ass. He must be pretty knowledgeable on the subject of Alchemy, so it makes sense."

GoldenSun,34r7it,Megadarth,17,Sun May 3 21:24:44 2015 UTC,"Dark Dawn was okay, the only problem I had with it was that it ended. More seriously, the game felt like a 20 hour side quest to the main plot, and ended with the main plot exactly where you left it when you tapered off into that side quest."
GoldenSun,34r7it,Jinketsu,6,Mon May 4 00:47:13 2015 UTC,"I would have finished making the game. I wouldnt have ended it with a freaking ""The End?""  I would have explored the Dark Adepts and how they differ from regular adepts, how they came to be and what their purpose is aside from being evil.  I would have had Isaac hunting Alex.  I would have had Felix in the game at all.  I would have included all of Weyard. You cant shrink the sorld in a sequel."
GoldenSun,34r7it,BloodChicken,5,Mon May 4 01:12:47 2015 UTC,Agree. One of the best parts of TLA was roaming the world at the end. Dark Dawn felt like there was no point in exploring or doing anything once the plot was over.
GoldenSun,34r7it,Sauron-Octopus-Lord,3,Mon May 4 01:32:04 2015 UTC,"What would you have done differently.    Made it a release game for the DS or 3DS. IMO, there are a lot of flaws with Dark Dawn, but none so big as when the game was released. It was put out near the end of the DS's life, when the market for games like it was already over-saturated and piracy was rampant. Even if the game was perfect, it would have struggled to sell well.  I'm quite of the opinion, that if DD had remained exactly as-is but had been a release DS title, it would incredibly successful. Or for that matter, increase the graphics and have it a release 3DS game. It would be awesome to say ""here's a new console and a new Golden Sun game on it"".  My other criticisms would be, being too easy in some parts (random encounters did 1 damage). And not being able to travel back to places you've been before. But these, IMO are minor quirks, compared to the release of it (if was on the shelves barely 3 months before the 3DS came out)."

Maybe it's because I've played the first two so much, or maybe it's not, but the enemies in the game were too easy to bet. I never had to use summons or djinn in my first play through."
GoldenSun,34r7it,scshunt,1 point,Sun May 3 21:39:51 2015 UTC,"I dunno; both my playthroughs I found the shadow beasts to be reasonably scary.

GoldenSun,34r7it,Andr007,2,Sun May 3 22:36:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that the difficulty was comparable. I think the shadow beasts were the level the regular enemies should have been. I didn't hate DD, but it was no where near in the same league as the first two. It seemed to just rehash some of the ideas from the first and didn't seem to be as immense as the originals."

GoldenSun,343grd,TerantQ,8,Tue Apr 28 01:00:46 2015 UTC,There is one reason why it has to be Isaac: The fact that everyone's already voted/voting for him. Isaac is consistently near the top of these types of polls. Trying to switch which character the Golden Sun community votes for this late in the game would only split our votes.
GoldenSun,343grd,radios_appear,13,Tue Apr 28 01:44:41 2015 UTC,"Well, Matthew reminds people of a game that shouldn't have been made.  Don't get me wrong, everybody wanted another Golden Sun game. But if Camelot wasn't going to give it their best effort, any fan would have been happier for the series to simply be dead. Dark Dawn was a very, very poor showing compared to the games that preceded it.  Isaac is the face of the franchise at its best. For better or worse, Matthew is the face of the franchise at its worst. I like Matthew; he's a good kid, but he has no place in Smash Bros."
GoldenSun,343grd,_Falgor_,5,Tue Apr 28 00:40:27 2015 UTC,He does have a place in Smash Bros: As Isaac's alt costume. Which would be a pretty good place.
GoldenSun,343grd,_Falgor_,8,Tue Apr 28 01:13:30 2015 UTC,Do people really think of Dark Dawn that poorly? I loved it.
GoldenSun,343grd,RaIshtar,8,Tue Apr 28 01:00:41 2015 UTC,"Imo, people tend to exaggerate the bad aspects of Dark Dawn. Of course the GBA games were almost perfect, so when you compare them, it's a little bit hard for DD. But it's still one of the best games of the DS. If the story was wrapped up, people would probably be much less harsh.  Though, Isaac's chances are still far better than Matthew's: A lot more people know him from his Brawl's removed AT (Even if they're almost identical) and due to him being in the three games. The first one being the one the most people played, the majority of the support is for him.  And since we need to agree on one character to increase our chances to see one character, everyone should vote for Isaac."
GoldenSun,343grd,princekamoro,12,Tue Apr 28 01:12:14 2015 UTC,It's simple to me.   Dark Dawn is a great game. Dark Dawn is not a great Golden Sun game.
GoldenSun,343grd,TerantQ,8,Tue Apr 28 01:15:13 2015 UTC,"My only problem with it was that the game locks you out of parts of the world forever, including djinn that you might have missed. And although it's good, it doesn't quite meet the standard set by the first two games."
GoldenSun,343grd,scarecr0w141,3,Tue Apr 28 01:26:07 2015 UTC,"I didn't like how much they messed with the world. It felt like an entirely different fantasy universe to me. Waaaaay too many changes to have reasonably happened in 30 years. Maybe if it was set in an entirely different era I'd have liked it, but it felt a bit like they threw out the legacy of the first two games to me."

I voted for Isaac not because I hate Dark Dawn, I loved all three game to bits (except for Sveta) but:  1) because of how stiff the competition for the character slot is. That is why golden sun fans should focus on voting one character for now.  2) Isaac is the most well known  character in the franchise. Tying to the above, the votes should be focused on Isaac only. Many people didn't know what Golden Sun is, but they might know Isaac. 3) Matthew and Felix could be alternates for Isaac(because they played exactly alike) 4) So that his removal as an assist trophy would not be in vain."

GoldenSun,332szi,MetalMollusk,11,Sat Apr 18 23:53:15 2015 UTC,"I think the tilted basic attacks should not be utilizing Psynergy the way you described them. They seem more suited for special attacks while the basic attacks should use his sword since Isaac is traditionally used as a warrior/fighter in the game rather than a caster.  I like the running dash attack.  Personally, I think Isaac's final smash would be Odyssey rather than Judgment. Odyssey and Ragnarok are more representative of Isaac/Felix since they are the main characters of the first two games. If it were to be a summon, I think Eclipse would have been the better choice because, in my experience, Eclipse is more popular than Judgment is.   I always envisioned Isaac's final smash going like this: When Isaac is close to someone, he kicks them forward triggering the animation. The animation would be similar to Dark Dawn's animation. The target would be suspended in the air while 4 swords impale them. During this, Isaac launches into the air and slams down with the final sword.  I always imagined Isaac's specials would be based off his active Djinn wwhich could be cycled with B:   Side Special:   Venus Djinn, casting Gaia forward and up diagonally starting from the ground forward. Enemies hit with the beginning of the animation take more damage while those hit further away are hit with fewer rocks, thereby taking less damage.  Mars Djinn: Isaac casts Blast psynergy a short distance in front of him. This can be charged to increase the blast radius. However, charging it to the maximum also puts Isaac in the blast zone and can hurt teammates. This side special has the shortest range of the four specials.   Jupiter Djinn: Isaac casts Astral Blast. The stars don't do much damage, but can knock opponents away. Of the four side specials, Astral blast has the longest range.  Mercury Djinn: Isaac casts Cutting Edge. The edge grows in size and strength as it flies forward. Does moderate damage.  Down Special:   Venus Djinn: Isaac casts a version of Quake. The longer he charges, the stronger the cast eventually become Quake Sphere. This Psynergy does more damage to enemies closer to Isaac and does less damage the farther they are away from Isaac.  Mars Djinn: Isaac counters similar to Marth and Ike. I couldn't think of anything else to fill this spot. Jupiter Djinn: Isaac casts Psy Drain. Instead of absorbing an energy projectile however, Isaac can redirect it in a direction of his choice.  Mercury Djinn: Isaac casts Froth as a swirling ball in front of him hitting enemies within the ball and dealing damage.   Up Special:   Venus Djinn: If Isaac is on the ground, he slams his sword into the ground and makes the ground around him erupt, propelling him upwards. If he's airborne, Isaac jumps up swinging his sword into the air dealing the most damage of the four up specials. Mars Djinn: Isaac jumps into the air dealing no damage initially. Before reaching maximum height, Isaac can hit B again to cast Planet Diver to slam forward into the ground. If Isaac hits someone on the way, he bounces off of them and is free to move around again but cannot use Up-B again till he is hit or lands.  Jupiter Djinn: Isaac uses a gust of wind to launch himself, dealing no damage, but it covers the most distance. This can also make him move in any direction (similar to how Fox/Falco can control their directions). Mercury Djinn: Isaac uses a geyser to jump only straight upwards dealing moderate damage, but has the most area of effect from his starting point.     Other Benefits: While having a Venus Djinn active, Isaac has average combat stats. With a Mars Djinn, Isaac's attacks are slow, but can deal burn damage. With Jupiter Djinn, Isaac's attacks are weak, but fast. With a Mercury Djinn, Isaac attacks slightly slower, but are the strongest. Also Isaac's sword glows different colors based on the Djinn (yellow/gold, red, light purple, and blue)."
GoldenSun,332szi,Alsenis,4,Sun Apr 19 03:40:08 2015 UTC,"Wow, your take on Isaac's potential set is really interesting. I like the idea that he almost seems like a completely different character based on what Djinn he has active. It's kind of like Shulk in a way except his specials also change, giving the moveset more depth. Really nice work on this, and thanks for the criticism. :)"
GoldenSun,332szi,EnderOS,3,Sun Apr 19 04:36:37 2015 UTC,"I really like your take on it, very interesting. However... no Move? I think Isaac really needs this Move move. Maybe Down Special with Mars Djinn, since (IMO) a counter attack isn't that good if you can't use it at anytime? And it would make sense because (I think) move is marked as a Mars psynergy in the games."

GoldenSun,332szi,BloodChicken,2,Mon Apr 20 01:43:30 2015 UTC,"That's pretty similar to the concept I've been developing, actually.   Fsmash : Unleash : Flint/Bane/Echo.   Similar to Peach's Fsmash, you rotate between the three Djinnis. Flint is a decently fast, mostly damaging strike carrying you forward slightly, Bane is fast but lackluster in both damage and launch power, although it applies a damage over time, and Echo is slow but excellent at KOing. The Djinnis all have a 10 second cooldown, meaning spamming the Fsmash to rotate through will make you end up using a non enhanced one.  Usmash : Thorn.   Brambles quickly rise from the ground, striking enemies close to and above Isaac.  Dsmash : Quake.   Pillars of earth rise from the ground on both sides of Isaac.  Ntrl. B : Ragnarok.   A giant sword appears and slashes enemies before Isaac, charge for a wider sword/longer reach.  Side B : Move > Force/Scoop/Pound.  A Dancing Blade-like combo. Hitting Side B for the first time will use Move, creating a giant hand moving forward and hitting enemies. Hitting UpB, DownB or SideB again after Move will use Scoop, Pound or Force, respectively.   Scoop : Basically an uppercut-slap. Good combo potential as it throws the enemies almost vertically and without much power. Force : The hand punches the enemy straight away from Isaac with great strength. Great zoning tool/KO attempt. Pound : Depending on the enemy's positioning when hit by Move, will either bury him (sweetspot) or just eject him away with decent damage.   Up B : Growth.   Isaac launches vines diagonally, lashing at enemies and allowing for tether recovery.  Down B : Unleash : Granite.   An earthen barrier rejecting projectiles and enemies appears before Isaac and briefly moves forward. Loses its repelling ability if used in quick succession and just stops projectiles and enemies in their tracks. (Again, Djinn refresh timer, maybe 5 sec ?)  Grab : Catch.  Compensates for its range with a greater endlag.  -Random ideas for rest of the moveset-  Jab combo : Horizontal slash > Upwards slash > Clay Spire coming diagonally from above Isaac.  Dair : Unleash : Ground : Isaac creates three gravity balls under him with a swipe of the hand, ejecting enemies away. Meteor sweetspot right under him, on the middle ball."
GoldenSun,332szi,MylesMad,2,Sun Apr 19 05:47:22 2015 UTC,"The best part is we have three completely unique move sets in this topic, and all three are completely separate from each other, yet all three would work perfectly. :)"
GoldenSun,32twpm,Megadarth,8,Thu Apr 16 18:01:48 2015 UTC,"We can speculate on a lot of things about this game, but what you say makes sense to me.  In fact, because we know Anemos was so advanced, I'm tempted to say that he may have been their police force.  I can imagine a civilization that has enough power to lift off into the sky, has their roads lined with these as statues.  Primarily functioning as way posts for those looking for directions or information, but springing to necessary action when called to duty.  Ironic how they became the moon, but left behind the power of the sun."

GoldenSun,32qy9g,radios_appear,3,Thu Apr 16 16:30:06 2015 UTC,"Oh really? Huh. The rom I have (for the rebalance hacks) was 16MB, which was what I was going off of."
GoldenSun,32qy9g,NickNack4EvahBra,6,Thu Apr 16 17:01:29 2015 UTC,Also when the Wise One gives Isaac his quest that could be like Moses and the ten commandments on Mount Sinai. Isaac is an Abrahamic faith Proper too. Sheba was a place mentioned in the Torah and Quran.  We can probably go on for a while :)
GoldenSun,32qy9g,ifrit1100,3,Thu Apr 16 09:15:02 2015 UTC,"Aleph is linked to Alpha, and Mt. Alpha is the french name for Mt. Aleph, so that makes perfect sense."
GoldenSun,32j5ri,dyn4styw4rrior,9,Tue Apr 14 05:19:42 2015 UTC,"There could be a few reasons for that, as you can tell before he is sucked down into the earth he learns the limits of his power because the wise one took some of the power and gave it to Isaac. It could probably be possibly because the wise one was also suppressing the power of psynergy at Mt. Aleph, this can be sort of proven at how weak the people of Vale are in the use of their psynergy (them not being able to stop a boulder and Garret struggling at using 'move'). Only after Isaac and Garret leave Vale, powers begin to grow at a very alarming rate after defeating so many enemies; however it can be argued that defeating the enemies forced them to use offensive psynergy and gaining melee experience as well forcing them to push themselves to their limits... But it would also make sense because their powers kicked in and saved them when they were attacked by Tret's curse, where again in Vale it did not.  Also, Mt. Aleph is where alchemy was essentially sealed, so they probably uses psynergy to seal it, so when it was broken, it could have created psynergy vacuums (reference to dark dawn) that sapped him of his power.  My other theory would be that vale has both fire and earth adepts. They say after you light the Jupiter lighthouse that because that and the mercury lighthouse are both lit, the whole of Weyard will begin to slowly freeze because both of those elements attributes are to cool. So having an area occupied by psynergy users whose attributes are to ""heat"" causes Alex to lose power, and disallowing him to use his current full power.  Alternatively, because he hurried quickly to Vale to reach the Golden Sun in time, caused him to exhaust his power.  Heres a tl;dr:   Psynergy is being sealed, causing all users to be weak. Vale is fire and earth territory, making Alex weak. Alex used a lot of power to get to the Golden Sun, making him weak."
GoldenSun,32j5ri,MrCata,5,Tue Apr 14 07:07:10 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the reasonable explanation was him teleporting from Prox all the way to vale with his psynergy, which drained him. But he knew there was absolutely no way he'd miss the Golden Sun, so he just started climbing.  Also it would be reasonable that the Wise One would be suppressing his Psynergy. He knew who alex was and knew his heart. Of course he wouldn't want him to get to the Golden Sun.   I don't think the people of Vale are have their Psynergy suppressed, but I think an Adept's levels of mastery varies greatly.   Consider that pretty much everyone born in Vale are Adepts due to their close proximity to mount Aleph, but then other Adepts in the whole of Weyard are a very rare occurrence. These adepts range in their mastery of Psynergy as well. Not everyone is a warrior, and they even mention in the opening scene during the storms in Vale that a lot of people are already Tapped out. Holding back the MASSIVE boulder took 4 people, all of which seemed to be priests and then just regular townsfolk. For all we know, they only ever used psynergy to get by in the day to day.  Garet practicing ""move"" was most likely due to him being 14 at the time. He was a young guy, who hadn't really had much training. Then, we look what happens when the characters get out of the town, and suddenly go from playing around with moving stone pillars, to fighting for their lives. This hones their psynergy usage, and widens their understanding.  Djinn help immensely as well. They help bridge the gaps that haven't been filled by experience. Each adept does what they can to increase their abilities, but what happens when you suddenly have a huge increase in your element type? You start making leaps and bounds in that element. As far as I can tell, the Djinni are living manifestations of their element type; embodiments of Venus, Jupiter, Mars and Mercury.   This is why IMO that the heroes are so weak at Vale and then exponentially stronger elsewhere."

So it can be assumed that he can feel where they are at anyway.  But he could have also checked thier locations via the mars star, and then moved the power to it as a plan C in case isaac did not stop the igniting of the lighthouses, or if the wise one was not able to stop them by intervening with a proxy.   I mean he is the ""Wise One""... He could have seen several different outcomes. What do you think?"
GoldenSun,32j5ri,MrCata,2,Wed Apr 15 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"Sorry it's taken me so long to get back, I just googled 'Golden Sun script' for that.  I personally think that the Wise One was just checking the location of the other stars by looking into the one.  I don't frankly feel like Isaac was more powerful than anyone else necessarily.  Everyone heard stories about him, such as the pirates talking about him defeating Deadbeard, and would have imagined up powerful warriors, but I equate the power difference there being due to the fact that Isaac and Co. were all adepts.  Sure they beat Saturos and Menardi, but that was two on four and while Saturos and Menardi were both powerful Mars adepts, Isaac and Co. had the combine might of all the elements on their sides.  Same applies to the second game with Felix and Co.  By the time DD rolls around, even though adepts are now much more common, the warriors of vale are so much more powerful by that point because of their experience.  Also, I'm not sure how I feel about this, but being exposed to the aries of all the lighthouses might have permanently augmented their powers as well, but that's unclear."

This said, if you have no intention of ever buying or emulating golden sun the lost age, get Earthbound. This is just because the two golden sun games are meant to be a pair. Earthbound is decent, and kind of funny. But imo the story doesn't compare to Golden sun at all.  Have fun :)"
GoldenSun,32gves,tinytim0,8,Mon Apr 13 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"African tribes in gondowan. Not really Australian culture but osenia is 100% Australian continent, just look at airs rock.   Izumo is pretty much japanese since the name of the characters are literally mythical figures in Japanese history.   An extension of this line of thinking would say that Hesperia and atteka  are north and south America.  Moapa and his village take on the role of native Americans and can't really say much for atteka.  Indra is without a doubt India.   Apojii islands = Fiji islands.   Tolbi is most likely Rome because of colosso and the karagol sea being pretty much the Mediterranean Sea.   There are igloo like structures in prox but I wouldn't classify prox as being Eskimo/Inuit culturally.   Edit: Thinking about Atteka and the town of Contingo and the ruins there kind of reminds me of the Incan Nazca lines."
GoldenSun,32gves,MrSnackage,2,Mon Apr 13 18:33:35 2015 UTC,"Had a brain fart and couldn't figure out what Colosso had to do with Rome.  Took me a minute.  Now I have another question, because we can be pretty sure there was essentially one culture before Alchemy was cut off, do we know how and how fast the cultures degenerated into what they are?"
GoldenSun,32gves,MrSnackage,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"We can only guess how long it took for each place to have their distinct cultures. Let's use Lunpa's map and the current (GS2) map as examples. In ~100 years the landmass changed that much. Barring any catastrophic events I would say that, from when the ruins in dark dawn were made to gs1, it took anywhere between 20,000-XX,XXX years. Yeah it's a huge range but I doubt it took more than 100,000 years since the erection of those monoliths to have them hidden by nature and forgotten by the people."
GoldenSun,32gves,ChainedProfessional,5,Tue Apr 14 20:25:49 2015 UTC,"Lemuria was of course the lost island of Atlantis. (And maybe Greece? They had senators or something, seems familiar)  Don't know if we had a Russia but maybe Prox is Russia."
GoldenSun,32gves,ChainedProfessional,2,Mon Apr 13 22:09:30 2015 UTC,"I hadn't made the connection to Prox and proto Russia.  Who was up there?  The Scythians?  I'll do some research.  Also, I need to look this up too, but I was under the impression that Atlantians originally came from Lemuria, and that in Greek mythology, they then proceeded from Atlantians.  Probably wrong though."
GoldenSun,32gves,TerantQ,2,Mon Apr 13 22:13:30 2015 UTC,"Could be, I don't know much about Atlantis.  I'm also wondering what some of the places in GS1 were. It seems like in GS2 they really pumped up the cultural influence.  Xian was in the first game, right? Clearly the token Chinese town."
GoldenSun,32gves,orangebomber,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:20:06 2015 UTC,"Aye, but the fact that they added several more along the coast in dark dawn leads me to believe that they are a more predominant culture in that part of the continent."
GoldenSun,32gves,Viteh,4,Mon Apr 13 22:36:30 2015 UTC,"Eh, Dark Dawn Weyard has totally different cultural influences than the Weyard of the first two games. It might as well be a different world."
GoldenSun,32gves,TerantQ,2,Mon Apr 13 22:48:36 2015 UTC,Different? Not really.  They decided to focus more on Angara (like GS1) and the upper Eastern Sea (like GS2) in Dark Dawn. They added more Chinese influences in Angara though instead of just Xian.
GoldenSun,32gves,wetterdew,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:20:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that things are a lot different, but if we are excepting it as canon, then we have to take the cultures therein as existing throughout GS 1 and 2 and we simply not interacting with them.  I personally feel like we can get a little better of an idea of where everything is and how it interacts with each other by using both all the games together."
GoldenSun,32gves,autowikibot,5,Mon Apr 13 22:54:54 2015 UTC,Hesperia was clearly North America. The people with the Shaman Rod were inspired by Native American Indians. While Atteka seemed to be influenced by Central American and South American cultures.
GoldenSun,32gves,Bakitus,4,Mon Apr 13 21:31:55 2015 UTC,"Expanding on what others have said:  Xian is China.  Kalay I'm not totally sure about but I'm gonna go with Istanbul.  Tolbi is Rome.  Lalivero is Alexandria, Egypt.  Daila is Delhi.  Madra is Madras."
GoldenSun,32gves,Bakitus,2,Mon Apr 13 22:59:28 2015 UTC,I feel like Lalivero has to be based on Lalibela in Ethiopia.  Its location is more like Alexandria's though.  I think it's a combination of Lalibela and Alexandria.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lalibela
GoldenSun,32gves,Bakitus,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:48:08 2015 UTC,"Lalibela:       Lalibela is a town in northern Ethiopia famous for monolithic rock-cut churches. Lalibela is one of Ethiopia's holiest cities, second only to Aksum, and a center of pilgrimage. Unlike Aksum, the population of Lalibela is almost completely Ethiopian Orthodox Christian. Ethiopia is one of the earliest nations to adopt Christianity in the first half of the fourth century, and its historical roots date to the time of the Apostles.  The layout and names of the major buildings in Lalibela are widely accepted, especially by local clergy, to be a symbolic representation of Jerusalem.  This has led some experts to date the current church forms to the years following the capture of Jerusalem in 1187 by Muslim leader, Saladin.   Lalibela is located in the Semien Wollo Zone of the Amhara ethnic division (or kilil), at roughly 2,500 meters above sea level. It is the main town in Lasta woreda, which was formerly part of Bugna woreda.

GoldenSun,32gves,Ferdi265,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:48:45 2015 UTC,"Perfect, I like this, I've looked up some things about the continents and such but it's vague.  Thanks for making those connections specifically."
GoldenSun,32gves,Bakitus,5,Mon Apr 13 23:21:59 2015 UTC,"I'm working on a big list of all the locations and their inspirations, and will post it here when I'm through, possibly in chunks.  Edit: List complete!  The entire world of Weyard was based on Earth geography and culture, with nearly every place in Weyard having an equivalent on Earth. Many have been mentioned already, but here I'll try to be as comprehensive as possible. Places are listed by continent first, and then by the order visited (in general, it gets a little non-linear after you get your ship). I've only focused on locations in the first two games only, nothing from Dark Dawn yet, though many of those places also do have similar real-world inspirations. If there may be anything that I have missed, please let me know so I can add onto the list! I love the amount of thought that clearly went into the locations of Weyard, combining history and geography with a great story and a fun game!  ANGARA  Angara - This continent corresponds to Eurasia, and takes its name from an alternate name for the Siberia Craton, an ancient piece of continental rock that now resides in central Russia. This is in turn named for the Angara River, also in central Russia.  Vale - The starting town, being in western Angara, obviously has the usual European fantasy style to it, though it is not explicitly based on any one place. The word ""vale"" refers to a type of valley, such as the one the town sits in.  Mt. Aleph - This mountain, seeing as it is the beginning of the plot of the games, is aptly named after the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, Aleph.  Vault - Similar to Vale, this town has no specific inspiration other than medieval Europe, but the name refers to the small, enclosed layout of the village, also evident in its original Japanese name, ""Coop-up Village.""  Lunpa - Another town without much direct inspiration, but still is mostly European in style, given its location so close to Vale and Vault. Coincidentally, there is a 2008 book called City of Thieves that is set in Saint Petersburg, Russia, which roughly corresponds geographically with Lunpa.  Goma Range - This dividing mountain range is very similar to the Ural Mountains, a range in Russia that is often used as part of a natural boundary between Europe and Asia.  Bilibin - Named almost directly from the town of Bilibino in northeast Russia, though the ruler, Lord McCoy, looks and sounds like he'd be more at home in Scotland.  Kolima - Near Bilibino sits the Kolyma River in the region of Kolyma.  Imil - Sitting in the extreme northwest of Angara, this town and the frozen region surrounding it represent Scandinavia. The name ""Imil"" is actually a mistranslation of ""Ymir"", a being form Norse mythology.  Fuchin Temple - This little temple is home to a group who poses striking similarities to Buddhist Monks, with the temple itself inspired by the real Shaolin Monastery, or the legendary Southern Shaolin Monastery in Fujian Province in China.  Mogall Forest - As revealed by Laurel and Tret in Kolima, this thick forest was previously a vast treeless prairie, not unlike the Mongolian Steppe of Central Asia.  Xian - Weyard's equivalent to China, this town was named directly after the city of Xi'an, one of the oldest and largest cities in China, and one of the major cities on the eastern end of the Silk Road.  Altin - Located deep in a thick knot of mountains, this mining town in central Angara seems to be named after the Altai Mountains, a name that means ""Gold Mountains"". It could also refer to the Altyn-Tagh, another mountain range just south of the Altai.  Lama Temple - This temple is inspired by the Yonghe Temple, also sometimes known as ""Lama Temple."" The name is also possibly a reference to its location on the edge of the Lamakan Desert.  Lamakan Desert - This hot and dry desert spotted with cool oases in the middle of the Silk Road is named for the Taklamakan Desert, another hot and dry desert spotted with cool oases in the middle of the Silk Road.  Kalay - Near the western end of the Silk Road, this prosperous seaside city is at a crossroads between Angara to the north and Gondowan to the south, making it very similar to Constantinople sitting between Europe, Asia and Africa.  Karagol Sea - Though it doesn't quite divide Angara and Gondowan (a river further south is the true border), this sea is equivalent to the Mediterranean Sea between Europe and Africa.  Crossbone Isle - This hidden island with a haunted pirate ship deep below the surface is named after the skull-and-crossbones symbol on Jolly Roger flags used by pirate ships.  Tolbi - A large, powerful city with a strong army ruled by a single man, subjugating far-off lands, and holding gladiator battles in an immense Colosseum? That's got to be Rome! ""Tolbi"" is a corruption of the Trevi Fountain in Rome, a large ornate fountain that people throw coins into for good luck, just like Tolbi Spring.  Altmiller Cave - This small cavern with strange ancient ruins is inspired by the Cave of Altamira in Spain, the first cave where cave paintings were discovered.  Champa - This town is named for the historical region in Vietnam and Cambodia known as Champa, once a prosperous seafaring kingdom.  Ankhol Ruins - This ancient temple is directly inspired by the Hindu/Buddhist temple of Angkor Wat, situated in the capital of the old Khmer Empire in modern-day Cambodia.  Loho - This mining town, home to a race of apparent dwarves, is on the far western edge of Angara, similar to the regions of Cornwall and Devon in the southwest of England, where mining has long been an important of the local economy. (Thanks to /u/Hyro22 for this one.)"
GoldenSun,32gves,Bakitus,3,Tue Apr 14 21:58:05 2015 UTC,"OSENIA and EASTERN SEA  Osenia - This is the stand-in for Australia. It is named for the larger region Oceania which includes Australia and the many Pacific Islands.  Mikasalla - This is one of the few towns that I have no idea what it is supposed to represent, other than agriculture in Western Australia. Geographically, it is closest to Perth and the Wheatbelt but even that feels like a stretch.  Yampi Desert - Deserts cover large regions of Australia, so Yampi plus the desert surrounding Air's Rock both represent the many deserts of Australia. Specifically, the Yampi seems to correspond closest with the Great Sandy Desert or the Tanami Desert. (Thanks /u/Hyro22)  Garoh - The town of werewolves likely draws its name from the French word for werewolf, Loup-Garou, pronounced Loo gah-ROO.  Air's Rock - A clever pun, this references Uluru/Ayers Rock, a sacred sandstone rock formation in central Australia. Visually, the overworld icon of all four elemental rocks is based on Uluru.  Alhafra - This town in the north of Osenia is named for the Arafura Sea that lies to the north of Australia and south of Indonesia.  Yallam - In the east of Osenia, this town could be named for the Ellam region between Adelaide and Melbourne, or could be named for the Yarra River in Melbourne.  Taopo Swamp - As /u/Hyro22 said, this may be a reference to the Arafura Swamp in the Northern Territory of Australia, or it may be a reference to any of the other swamps of eastern Australia.   Balloo Range - Only mentioned a few places in dialogue, this is the range that separates Yallam and Taopo from the rest of Osenia. It is referring to the Great Dividing Range and named after one portion of it, the Blue Mountains  Islands of the Great Eastern Sea - The various little islands in the Eastern Sea don't represent anywhere specific, just the Pacific Islands in general.  Apojii Islands - These are equivalent to the Galápagos Islands. The connection is stronger in the Japanese name for the Islands, Garapas, as revealed in a translation error when mind-reading the girl running Item Shop here. There may also be a pun at work here, with the word apogee referring to the point in an elliptical orbit when the orbiting body is furthest away from the body being orbited, referring to the great distance one must travel to reach the Apojii Islands.  Aqua Rock - This rock is inspired by Easter Island. Much of the island was formed by an extinct volcano, Terevaka, which also contains a lake inside one of its craters. Also on the island are the famous Moai statues, a feature that has been copied all four elemental rocks.  Izumo - Obviously Weyard's version of Japan. The name comes from an old town, province, and shrine all called Izumo.  Gaia Rock - Due to its placement, this rock is likely meant to be a stand-in for Mount Fuji, the largest and most famous of Japan's mountains, and a dormant volcano.  Treasure Isle - This island full of pirate treasure is named after what is arguably the most famous pirate story, Treasure Island.  Tundaria - This represents Antarctica, with its shape coming from the appearance the continent has on certain map projections. The name is a reference to the tundra biome.  Lemuria - This ancient and hidden city is a combination of three different ""lost continent"" myths: Atlantis for culture and technology, Lemuria for the name, and Mu for the location in the Pacific Ocean/Great Eastern Sea."
GoldenSun,32gves,Hyro22,3,Wed Apr 15 19:35:05 2015 UTC,"WESTERN CONTINENTS  Atteka - This continent is the equivalent of South America, though the name may be a combination of the Aztec people of Central America and the Attica region of Greece, since the Anemos are a reference to the ancient Greek wind gods.  Contigo - The only settlement visited on Atteka, the name is actually the Spanish phrase con tigo, meaning ""with you,"" referencing the reunion of Felix's and Isaac's groups into a single travelling party. Incidentally, in the Spanish translation of the game, the town name uses German instead, becoming Mitdir.  Hesperia - This continent's name has been historically been used by the Greeks to refer to lands west of them, such as Italy or the Iberian Peninsula, with the word deriving from the Greek God of the Evening Star, Hesperus and his daughters the Hesperides. Being the westernmost continent, it is fitting that this analogue to North America is given a name that means ""western land.""  Hesperia Settlement - This little camp appears to have been made in a region resembling the American Southwest, possibly the Grand Canyon.  Shaman Village - With geography also resembling the American Southwest, this village represents the Native Americans, complete with feathers in the hair, Pueblo buildings, and Tipi tents. A shaman or a medicine man is a traditional healer in many Native American cultures.  Kalt Island - This frozen island in the far north is likely a representative for Iceland, though the name may also refer to the Celtic people, now located mainly in the western parts of Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and Brittany. Kalt also means ""cold"" in both German and Icelandic (Thanks to /u/Ferdi265)  Northern Reaches and Prox - This region is the in-game equivalent to the Arctic, a mix of snow-covered land and pack ice. The village's name may reference its close proximity with the great Rift that is threatening to swallow it and the entire world up."
GoldenSun,32gves,Matthew_Terra,2,Wed Apr 15 19:35:57 2015 UTC,"I wish I could express my thanks to you for this, but nothing seems quite adequate.  This will surely help many people understand the game much better if they read it."

GoldenSun,32gu51,tinytim0,14,Mon Apr 13 18:13:42 2015 UTC,"I never got the hang of the class system.  Swapping Djinn around made everyone weaker, and then their Psynergy would disappear when I unleashed the Djinn. This was a disaster if I tried to do anything with Mia and she lost Ply.  I beat both games with the vanilla Djinn layout, and I only switched them to use Growth on those little plants."
GoldenSun,32gu51,ChainedProfessional,3,Mon Apr 13 22:36:37 2015 UTC,"I would say this is mostly only true in GS1.  In TLA you get a LOT more djinni to play around with and a huge amount of super strong psynergy become acessible (one of the better-known examples being the ninja class series' Annihilation, a single target move that scales off your attack stat rather than having a base damage).    Mono-element classes are actually generally the weakest in terms of stats (IIRC mars djinn-only has the lowest average stats in the game).  With dual-element and tri-element classes, you get access to a much bigger variety of psynergy that can cover any elemental weaknesses along with the ability to put certain buffing psynergy on characters that normally don't get them.  For example, with 4 jupiter and 3 venus djinni, Mia can have both pure wish AND revive, which would only be on Isaac/Felix if you played mono-element.  An example of great stat increases would be Isaac/Felix having 190% HP, 150% attack, and 150% agility with a set of 9 venus djinni, but 200% HP, 170% attack, and 190% agility when they have 5 jupiter and 4 mars equipped.  If anything, the class system is one of the things that really makes Golden Sun stand out as unique in the realm of RPGs.  There's a whole lot of customization you can play around with, though again, it's much easier to do in TLA where you have more than double the djinn count available."
GoldenSun,32gu51,synapsii,3,Tue Apr 14 02:04:22 2015 UTC,"Personally I never bothered with the mixed classes until I collected every djinn just because it caused less of a headache. Once I got all the djinn I just used guides to fool around and make my team.   I started major fights after that by summon rushing the first turn and sometimes into the second. From there, the djinn just make my team stronger while they take damage."
GoldenSun,32gu51,Alsenis,1 point,Tue Apr 14 01:30:04 2015 UTC,"I tried to keep up summoning throughout any given fight, for some reason my team would run out of Psynergy so fast that it wasn't viable for attacking.  I would sometimes do the ""Isaac and Garet attack with unleashing swords while Ivan casts Plasma and Mia heals"" but even then Ivan would usually run out after a while."
GoldenSun,32gu51,ChainedProfessional,1 point,Tue Apr 14 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"In the first game, if it was a boss and took a while, I would granite and flash with Isaac and Garet, Sword with Ivan and Mia, and heal with Mia when necessary."
GoldenSun,32gu51,ManWithYourPlan,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:20:32 2015 UTC,I think you have to have a minimum of like 6-7 djinn on everyone before you can take steps towards other classes
GoldenSun,32gu51,Hyro22,1 point,Thu Apr 16 15:23:45 2015 UTC,"Always made the vanilla layout easier to use, do you have any suggestions for solutions to this?"
GoldenSun,32gu51,NickNack4EvahBra,7,Mon Apr 13 23:48:24 2015 UTC,"I didn't like how you could not visit the map from GS1 in GS2. While I fully understand the reasons why this was done, I think it would have been cool to have more cut scenes / conversations with the old NPC's. It would also be cool to see what effects the lit lighthouses would have on them as well. Maybe one or two optional bosses like that lion + dragon + snake tail unused enemy. Fushin falls cave could open up a large dungeon if you put one of those useless fungus items on it."
GoldenSun,32gu51,TerantQ,3,Mon Apr 13 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"I always liked the idea of expanded dungeons and optional bosses, maybe for extra story or exposition or a nifty item.  Also, I'd like to see an expanded GS game that's completely open world.  Alas, that dream may never be."
GoldenSun,32gu51,TerantQ,3,Mon Apr 13 23:47:45 2015 UTC,"If you angle the boat just right at a certain spot near Loho, you can actually hop off onto Angara near where Tolbi was, and reexplore the TBS' world map. The only overworld icons that show up are Vale, Lalivero, and one other one I can't remember (maybe it was Imil), and stepping onto the icons does nothing. Still a fun thing to try.  What bothers me as far as missing cut scenes is the lack of a conversation if you go back to Lemuria after getting Isaac's group. They made a huge deal out of them getting there in the last quarter of TBS, and yet they have nothing to say if you take them."
GoldenSun,32gu51,pack_fan31,5,Wed Apr 15 05:01:21 2015 UTC,"I think GS needs swarm enemies. One of the best ways to make combat more interesting would be to allow encounters of up to 15 or 20 monsters.  As it is, you're generally a party of 4 that can only be attacked by up to 5 enemies at a time, and they're never 5 of the stronger monsters. With an 8 person party, you always outnumber your enemies, and barring bosses your individual party members also always outmatch those enemies one-on-one.  Swarms could add a bit of toughness and variety to random encounters without changing the actual balance at all and also give mages more of a defined role by making AoE psynergy important."
GoldenSun,32gu51,pack_fan31,3,Mon Apr 13 23:45:01 2015 UTC,"I've been playing through the Fallen Star hack.  It greatly increases difficulty, and I frankly enjoy it much more.  Very professionally done too, and now I actually have to weigh my battles.  I've always kind of wished that we could have all 8 party members fighting at once too though, the whole combat system could use a bit of a revamp."
GoldenSun,32gu51,pack_fan31,1 point,Mon Apr 13 23:52:44 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks! Talking about balance hacks with my friend is actually what led to the idea of swarms."

GoldenSun,32gu51,WoollyHats,2,Fri Apr 17 13:35:42 2015 UTC,"What I did was on my iPhone I went to this website It's the official website for GBA4iOS and then I went to download, and that was how I got it on my phone.  You might have to spoof it and change the date setting to backwards a day in order to get it to work, but make sure you change it back.  Then you click on the search at the top to enter your homepage (which you can change in settings, I think by default it's set to google.)  You can now search for roms, and download them directly from the internet.    If you want a patched rom like I did, I had to get on my computer and patch it, then put it in dropbox.  Then from the search function in the app, I navigated to my dropbox and downloaded it from there."
GoldenSun,32gu51,orangebomber,1 point,Fri Apr 17 17:36:27 2015 UTC,Golden Sun should adopt the same system as Megaman Battle Network for the boss rematches: After defeating a boss for the first time they can be encountered somewhere else and be fought with higher hp and attack as well as better moves. After that fight they can be random encounters with even higher difficulty. They can also drop good rewards upon defeat (as long as it's not rng drops-i hate those)

Isaac has the best chance because he's the most recognized character in the series. Felix has maybe, 4 lines in all 3 games? The best we could hope for is an alternate skin for Isaac that is Felix."
GoldenSun,31sip7,Animedingo,10,Tue Apr 7 21:00:08 2015 UTC,"Regardless of how I phrased it, I want to see a Golden Sun character win. Isaac has the best chance. It's just how things are.

GoldenSun,31sip7,TerantQ,9,Tue Apr 7 21:04:42 2015 UTC,"Agreed 100%. Isaac is consistently near the top of these polls. No one else is ""on the ballot"" so to speak."
GoldenSun,31sip7,Alsenis,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:33:53 2015 UTC,I think the closest we'll get to Felix is an alternate skin of Isaac dressed AS Felix. Not much beyond that

GoldenSun,31sip7,TerantQ,5,Wed Apr 8 01:32:14 2015 UTC,For sure!
GoldenSun,31sip7,zonine,6,Wed Apr 8 04:15:37 2015 UTC,"Well said. I, too, would have preferred Felix, but Isaac must carry the torch."

GoldenSun,31sip7,_krakatoa_,1 point,Wed Apr 8 07:36:52 2015 UTC,"Well, Matthew is pretty reasonable,  because he's the most recent main character.  Though,  I would still prefer Isaac over Matthew."

I would love Jenna or Felix to make it, but I voted Isaac for the same reason. The move set of any of the characters would be great though! I was thinking something like using a sword (or axe) for neutral A and (some?) air attacks, and psynergy/djinn could make up the rest of his smash and special moves. Judgment would probably work for his final smash."

I think one of the issues with implementing it on a large game like Skyrim is that you basically have to write double the dialogue and do a bunch more programming for each NPC, and large games have A LOT of NPCs."
GoldenSun,31kjy4,NickNack4EvahBra,3,Mon Apr 6 16:09:23 2015 UTC,"I think that's why you don't get Mind Read in Dark Dawn until like halfway through (or Spirit Sense, I believe it was).

GoldenSun,31hzkh,Coaltergeist,7,Sun Apr 5 06:38:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely worth a short.   Honestly having the support of the characters developer doesn't mean that much to me because frankly being in smash is one of the best forms of advertisement you can get. I really can't think of any consequences of being included other than great publicity, exposure, and renewed sales for the series.  I would still be happy to see it though, as it would give some validation to the idea that Isaacs inclusion could lead to GS4 :)"

GoldenSun,31hzkh,_Falgor_,3,Sun Apr 5 14:50:46 2015 UTC,"I do so I can tell you it says to send ""Opinions and Thoughts"" to webmasterX@camelot.co.jp, but that seems to be just regarding the website.  It also however, says at the bottom in small print to ""send any enquiries regarding a game's content's to the customer inquiry counter of the companies involved"". I imagine in this case it would be Camelot, and so you would probably use the following address underneath:  株式会社キャメロット 〒160-0022 東京都新宿区新宿 1-28-11 小杉ビル3F  This translates to:  Camelot PLC  〒160-0022  Tokyo City, Shinjyuku Ward, Shinjyuku  1-28-11  Kosugi Building 3F  However, I imagine such enquiries would be more serious in tone (and also handwritten in Japanese) and thus not really appropriate. I would therefore say the webmaster address might be the better deal. I would once again however imagine you will have to write it in Japanese. If someone gave me an email to write I could try translating it for them, but I imagine just one email isn't going to do much good."

GoldenSun,31d2ve,_Falgor_,5,Fri Apr 3 22:49:18 2015 UTC,"Okay so I post this because I really fear something: Since Phil Spencer has made a statement about how he would be okay to let Banjo-Kazooie enter Smash, that may change a lot of things.  Shantae and Shovel Knights teams also showed their support for their characters. I'm not sure that Nintendo is going to take all of this into account, because their sites states that the people voting should vote for Nintendo characters. But still, between trolls and this, it may be more difficult than we thought.  We need motivation, we need to show a LOT of support to Isaac. I suppose that the smaller the hashtag is, the simpler it is to spread it. #Isaac4Smash seems to be the best choice, in that case.  One battle at a time, after he's in, we can start fighting for Golden Sun 4.  The Golden Sun community lets out a howl! THE SUN WILL RISE AGAIN!"
GoldenSun,31d2ve,kakirono,4,Fri Apr 3 22:57:43 2015 UTC,"People are so quick to vote on a favorite character that they always seem to miss the big picture. The problem is that everyone considers what character X can do for Smash, not the other way around.  Sure, someone like Waluigi, Ganon, Sceptile, Bandana can all have incredibly diverse movesets and gimmicks that the roster hasn't seen, hell I've seen amazing movesets for characters like Chrom made by the Smash community that could put the roster's most unique characters to shame.   But including these characters will hardly impact their respective franchises. Although any character is a welcome addition in my book, we already have satisfactory representation of big series such as Pokemon, Mario, Zelda, KI, FE, etc.  Additionally, Golden Sun is a franchise that has already proven itself to be one of the most critically acclaimed RPGs of its time. Newer IPs such as Splatoon have yet to prove itself, while other recent IPs weren't as well-received contrary to what the hype suggested before their release (Wonderful 101, Codename STEAM).  So what's the point? Adding someone from Golden Sun, a series that has already proved its worth, will not only expand the roster in terms of gameplay, franchise representation, and diversity, but it will finally push Camelot to conclude the Golden Sun series and develop, what seems to be, its final game (For now)."

GoldenSun,317xlk,RivetSpawn,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:28:35 2015 UTC,"Well, imagine the message sent to Camelot if he gets into Smash 4, and then the amiibos all sell out instantly. :P"
GoldenSun,317xlk,Coaltergeist,5,Fri Apr 3 06:27:15 2015 UTC,"Lol, lets just hope we can get him in in the first place"
GoldenSun,317xlk,AgentLym,4,Thu Apr 2 19:17:12 2015 UTC,"That's true. But more importantly, he'd be in Smash 4.:)"
GoldenSun,317xlk,GiantKJB,3,Thu Apr 2 23:33:06 2015 UTC,That would be AWESOME!!
GoldenSun,317xlk,Viteh,3,Thu Apr 2 23:36:34 2015 UTC,I'd die for an Isaac amiibo. I'd probably buy one to play with and one to just display.
GoldenSun,317xlk,SonicLink125,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:21:14 2015 UTC,All my want!!! Just hope he won't be an exclusive.
GoldenSun,317xlk,Insilencio,1 point,Fri Apr 3 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"Wow, I didn't even consider this! Awesome!"
GoldenSun,317xlk,ManWithYourPlan,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:48:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, the Amiibo thing hasn't interested me that much. I've mained Marth and loved him since SSBM. I probably wouldn't buy a marth Amiibo.  I would buy an Isaac one instantly"
GoldenSun,317jbm,Coaltergeist,8,Thu Apr 2 16:47:20 2015 UTC,"Now that Nintendo has a poll for future smash characters, I think there's a good chance we'll see Isaac in Smash 4. I'm hoping that will urge Camelot to make a GS4, but it all really depends on how Isaac (or any other GS character in Smash) is received.  They need to be good fighters and really well-liked to spur new interest in the games since the fan base for GS has likely not increased all that much since Dark Dawn."
GoldenSun,317jbm,Alsenis,2,Thu Apr 2 17:14:28 2015 UTC,"Pit kind of sucked in Brawl. Little Mac wasnt even a playable character lol. My point is, the fan response to putting Isaac in should be enough to grab their attention, regardless if he is even a ""good"" fighter"
GoldenSun,317jbm,Alsenis,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:21:02 2015 UTC,"Pit may not have been that great, but he was still rather popular and easy to play and be decent with. Regardless, as long as they make Isaac a very likable character, then I think GS will get the attention it needs for a new game."
GoldenSun,314cy3,Viteh,23,Wed Apr 1 22:29:17 2015 UTC,"We need to get MASSIVE votes from all the Golden Sun fans all around the world. If he doesn't make it in the game after this, he'll never do."
GoldenSun,314cy3,_Falgor_,14,Wed Apr 1 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"The fact that they want to know your gender suggests that they are taking that demographic into account when making decisions.  Based on the sudden spike of playable female characters in SSB4, I think that they are looking for characters who appeal to more than just male gamers.  Therefore, if you are a woman, I think Isaac could especially use your vote.  Show them that Isaac is a character who both genders would enjoy playing as!"
GoldenSun,314cy3,wetterdew,2,Wed Apr 1 23:40:04 2015 UTC,"Female: check Voted for Isaac: check  I really really want him to win, it would be so awesome. His B moves could be Djinn and his final smash could be ragnarok (that was my favorite spell, and what's cooler than hurling a giant sword at someone?) or gaia, that seems pretty iconic for him."
GoldenSun,314cy3,ugathanki,3,Thu Apr 2 17:21:36 2015 UTC,"Even if you're not a woman, mark on the form that you're female. We've probably got plenty of male support for Isaac coming from /r/smashbros, but I'm sure Nintendo will notice if tons of female fans vote for one sexy man character in particular! :D"
GoldenSun,314cy3,Insilencio,9,Thu Apr 2 06:11:57 2015 UTC,"This is huge, and I'm actually really hopeful it works out. Look at ProjectM: Isaac was the most voted for addition out of all the possible options (or at least one of them; I can't seem to access the old poll page). This can definitely happen, guys!"
GoldenSun,314cy3,fractalJester,10,Wed Apr 1 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"Isaac wasn't removed as an Assist Trophy without a reason, he'd be the first magic-knight on the roster from a well-received and under-represented series (It baffles me that we don't even have a trophy for him).  He's easily one of the most unique sword-wielding characters (If you can ever consider him as one, since his arsenal heavily consists of Psynergy and various summons) that Nintendo has at their disposal. Furthermore, his addition can finally push Camelot to finish up the series and give us the fourth installment.  I have faith in Sakurai's decisions."
GoldenSun,314cy3,kakirono,2,Thu Apr 2 02:25:10 2015 UTC,"A button sword attacks, with weapon unleashes for smashes and/or directional A attacks. B button Earth psynergy attacks (Ragnarok for side, Grand Gaia for up, Spire for down, Move or Growth for just B). And judgement for final smash."
GoldenSun,314cy3,Hyro22,3,Thu Apr 2 05:36:44 2015 UTC,"The one problem I see with using his psyenrgy for special attacks, is that all of them are very grandious, they're big, slow, and powerful. Like I could see spire or growth, but Ragnarok is huge and slow, as is grand gaia.   One option I could see is more use of the utility psyenergy, like using the ghostly hand for grabbing, throwing, punching, etc."
GoldenSun,314cy3,Animedingo,2,Fri Apr 3 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"I agree fully with this and actually went pretty in depth in my submission. Catch psynergy would be used for the grab button (with a similar speed/range to link/samus) then a small move animation (much smaller than Isaac's trophy) in the direction of the throw. Spire would be a quick close range attack. Grand gaia would be a larger range attack; high damage/knock back (think luigi's phantom uppercut range and power) if you are on top of the enemy and on the ground, then an AOE attack that does smaller damage/knock back the further away from Isaac the enemy is. Ragnarok would be a ranged attack with timing similar to falcon punch with a similar cool down. Higher damage/knock back closer to the point of the sword with less damage if the enemy is closer to the hilt.  Edit: I really wish the submission wasn't limited to 500 characters or I would have mapped out every little detail, This is something I've been thinking about way too much."
GoldenSun,314cy3,Hyro22,2,Fri Apr 3 04:33:03 2015 UTC,Heck yes. Judgement for final smash would be wicked amazing.
GoldenSun,314cy3,Sensei_Wally,7,Fri Apr 3 01:43:46 2015 UTC,I came here to post the same thing.  I already voted for him!  GO ISAAC!
GoldenSun,314cy3,wetterdew,6,Wed Apr 1 22:55:41 2015 UTC,So this isn't an April fool's? I'm so happy right now

GoldenSun,314cy3,FeniksTO,8,Wed Apr 1 23:19:40 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah! We need Isaac!
GoldenSun,314cy3,KisukeUraharaHat,7,Wed Apr 1 23:20:21 2015 UTC,"I'll be voting for him as soon as I figure out what I want to say. Golden Sun was a huge part of my childhood, I want to get it just right."
GoldenSun,314cy3,Dizzard,4,Wed Apr 1 23:36:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly what I'll do. Between the hundreds of troll answers they will probably get, the well written ones will be even more important. And we're a clever community.  Also, I would like to say that we're not sure on how things will turn if you vote multiple times, so I'd say don't risk it. Quality > Quantity.  It seems obvious that they already have ideas for characters but want to get more clues to choose between them. And Isaac must be among them."
GoldenSun,314cy3,_Falgor_,4,Thu Apr 2 00:52:43 2015 UTC,"Just made this gigantic post with a bunch of reasons compiled as to why to vote for him, not that it'll do any good posting it in the Golden Sun sub since everyone here all already know what a sexy beast he is and why you should vote for him. But still  http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/314h39/sakurai_on_twitter_new_smashbros_fighters_are_on/cpyqf91  Might inspire a few people with some reasons to add to the 500 characters to why he should be in which was one of the main points, plus it goes over the obvious logic that we all have to vote for Isaac even if there's another GS character who'd be cooler.  Replying to you guys in particular since you didn't know exactly how to word it lol hopefully it gives some reasons, surprisingly I haven't even voted yet. Need to make the best use out of all 500 characters as possible...we must believe in Nintendo, when we unite the Golden Sun fanbase is truly unmatched <3"
GoldenSun,314cy3,najex,2,Thu Apr 2 10:13:05 2015 UTC,I hope mine was quality enough.. I talked about how well-regarded the series is and how Isaac's myriad abilities and weapons/armour choices would allow for a very flexible fighter with a range of unique combat abilties

Damn, an official way of showing that GS is important to us! Who would have thought this would happen?"
GoldenSun,314cy3,SaiphCharon,6,Thu Apr 2 00:53:09 2015 UTC,Fuck yeah. Just voted. Pls based Sakurai. Pls.

GoldenSun,314pdi,ManWithYourPlan,2,Thu Apr 2 14:28:19 2015 UTC,"The problem with Felix, is that despite being a playable character for more time than Isaac, he never really had any character development. Both he and Isaac were blank when you played as them, but Isaac had a personality in Lost Age. The only personality we saw of Felix was briefly at the beginning. And he was completely absent in Dark Dawn"
GoldenSun,314pdi,Animedingo,1 point,Fri Apr 3 02:30:31 2015 UTC,"Considering Isaac, Felix, and Matthew all pretty much have the same movesets, why not just make them different skins or models for he same one?"
GoldenSun,314pdi,tinytim0,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:14:26 2015 UTC,Honestly I believe that Felix would suit Smash Better with his Sand Psyenergy as special Recovery but they could give it to Isaac much like how they gave Ness PK starstorm.

Then you can choose whether you want to transfer a Gold, Silver or Bronze password. The password you see, has to be put in your Lost Age File (as long as Isaac isn't a playable yet, but I recommend you to input it right away since there are some valuable items you can get before Isaac joins).  Since its an Emulator, maybe you can link your games? If you open GS and TLA in 2 different windows, maybe someone can verify this if it works or not, in order not to put manually the password..."

One of those classic JRPG 'playful child knows something but won't tell parents to avoid getting in trouble' kinda things. Like with the Jupiter Djinni in the Temple of the Sea God.  I think accessing ancient or previous civilization routes into towns was actually a large part of Golden Sun's gameplay and really drove forward how the people of Weyard went about their lives with no idea what was under their feet, so to speak.

Deathbeard I fought early, so the same as everyone else. As for the final boss, I can hit him for 400-600 a hit (if memory serves me correctly), and it only takes a few minutes at most.

GoldenSun,2yq3mc,radios_appear,1 point,Thu Mar 12 04:13:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I'd almost like to see them abandon the current story. Starting fresh either in the distant future, or far before the first games would be ideal for me. If it was in the past, we could see the story of the creation of the elemental stars, the world with alchemy, when the stars are handed over to Vale and put into watch by the Wise One, etc. If it was in the distant future, we could look back on whatever it is Alex eventually does, and start a fresh, non-convoluted story. I'm personally not a fan of the light / dark adepts, in any way shape or form I can see them introducing them."

GoldenSun,2yq3mc,kurosaur,1 point,Mon Mar 23 17:32:56 2015 UTC,"I agree. Dark Dawn was left on a cliffhanger, it doesn't make sense to start fresh since Matthew just looks and points at a massive vortex and a spaceship looking thing at the end. However since it ended at an 8 person party, a new game is also justified. I'd like to think some people missing in action that are mentioned in the story could be potential new party members like Susa's and Kushinada's son who could be an Earth Adept and and Nowell. Also if they could not nerf the monsters so much, that'd be great."

GoldenSun,2xpumn,EpicJupiter09,2,Wed Mar 4 14:26:37 2015 UTC,What?! Play it! It's not a bad game at all. Just remember your point of no return locations and grab all the djinn/items before you reach them.
GoldenSun,2xpumn,Hyro22,1 point,Thu Mar 5 17:27:41 2015 UTC,"It bought it and the guide when it came out, but I'm just worried hat it wont be like the originals. I expect a certain amount of change when it comes to sequels, but I can't bring myself to open it. Does the story stay true to the GS universe or was it a sequel just made for profit?  Edit: Fat thumb mistake because of my mobile."
GoldenSun,2xpumn,EpicJupiter09,3,Thu Mar 5 21:43:39 2015 UTC,"Without spoiling anything, it basically ends with a lot of unresolved plot points. That will probably get resolved if/when they make a sequel. It still feels like golden sun if that's what your asking. It's easier than the earlier games (Both puzzles and battles if you are the kind of person who loves to grind). Personally I loved the game except for those damn PONRs. It's met with a lot of negativity simply because golden sun fans were expecting the second coming of Jesus. It's far from perfect but honestly, if you like golden sun you will like this game hands down."

They would've been searching the ocean first to find the island (IdeJima?) and that could've taken awhile. It would explain why they didn't have to use grind, because by the time they got there Felix has already removed it.   Now as far as gathering treasure during this time I have no clue why they don't gain any levels or items. Haha. Oh well :3"

GoldenSun,2wlkbs,isaac3000,2,Tue Feb 24 07:32:29 2015 UTC,"My personal thought on this: Saturos at that point had access to level 3 Psynergies whereas Garet had access to level 2. So, all his level 3 ones got removed, thats why Garet was unaffected! Of course if you take your time to make Garet learn Flare Storm, he can still use it, but at that point of the game, he cant. I like to think it that way, it still doesnt make completely sense, since Garet wasnt a skilled Mars Adept, so one would assume the pure essence of Mercury Psynergy would make him incappable of casting any Mars Psynergy...well...I dont know..   2.I always thought it was funny that Kraden hid this fact BUT I like to tie Garoh with Belinsk, let me explain, in Garoh there is an old man saying he heard of people outside Osenia turning to other animals (does this remind you of something?). The civilization of Belinsk was extinct by the time of Lost Age, but the Ruins were there (they were there we just didnt visit them XD), so Kraden might have read about the Alchemy Dynamo beneath Belinsk's ruins, and wanted to keep it a secret no matter what (because we all know what it does), so he acted as if he didnt know about Were people...any thoughts?  3.Gameplay, story wise Isaac is stronger than Felix and Co. Agatio and Karst confirmed it, they barely won against Isaac and Ivan!"

GoldenSun,2wlkbs,isaac3000,2,Tue Mar 24 12:19:06 2015 UTC,"No. 3 Avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid rest in cabin of ship rinse and repeat the question you should really be asking is where is Isaac and his groups ship??? It was not docked anywhere on the island so where the hell did they make port?  Did it crash and sink so they had to swim the rest of the way????  Why do they still have the orb for the ship if to drive the ship it needs to be placed in the generator inside the ship!?  Also my thoughts on how they got back to vale at the end of 2, did they use the flying ship to go over the mountains or did they dock at Vault and hike all the way over them >_>  No. 2 Kradens a historian on Weyard and alchemy who's old, I'd be surprised if their was much he didn't know especially serving a man like Babi for so long.  Hell the stories Babi could tell would probably have been great from his journey with Lunpa to Lemuria.  No. 1 Saturos and Menardi my thoughts are more along the lines of simple game logic this is simply difficulty progression and we had to come up with a reason for some of the stuff we did in game.  The venus lighthouse I think it's relation between fire and earth is Magma it contains both earth and fire so the link might not be total bull.  The dragon thing my guess is you need a shit tonne of psyenergy and need to be willing to sacrifice your own life to do it.  In the second game the dragon wasn't as big of a deal as you know the wise one..."
GoldenSun,2wlkbs,Archer0000,2,Thu Mar 12 11:39:32 2015 UTC,"I like your points about the ship issues. Both are right... They shouldn't have the Black Crystal in their inventory and their ship should appear somewhere!  It is possible that they used Avoid to escape random battles, but with Isaac and co. in the mid to late 20's (a normal level range for a standard playthrough), the monsters would eventually be too strong for Avoid to work. Who knows what they were thinking..."

GoldenSun,2wlkbs,XxLTxX,1 point,Wed Mar 18 09:14:11 2015 UTC,"I honestly thought Saturos and Menardi were trying to scare them off and pretend to be evil because they didn't want Isaac and co. to be involved as they were just children.  When Kraden seemed so knowledgeable about werewolves, I suspected he was a werewolf. Turns out it's because he studied a lot about them. It honestly made me kind of disappointed.  Yeah, it doesn't make sense at all. Maybe they ran from every single battle."

GoldenSun,2ut1o4,Animedingo,8,Wed Feb 4 22:47:00 2015 UTC,Kraden is not the only one effected.  It is specifically stated at the beginning of the game that all the Warrior's of Vale that were either on the mountain or at the lighthouses had the aging process slowed down.
GoldenSun,2ut1o4,belac889,2,Thu Feb 5 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"Right...But Kraden looks exactly the same, while Isaac and Garet, look 40. And if they were aging normally, they should look close to 40."
GoldenSun,2ut1o4,MrSnackage,9,Thu Feb 5 00:20:00 2015 UTC,Because there is a lot of change from going to 47 from 17. I thought that Isaac only looked like he aged 10 years and grew a beard.   Kraden was already old and won't change much appearance wise his organs are what changed the most.   You first start to show signs of aging on the outside and then your insides change more as you grow older.

GoldenSun,2uczbt,ant900,6,Sun Feb 1 01:04:39 2015 UTC,"Camelot still appears to be alive, though whether or not they're working on a new Golden sun game is debatable.   One one hand, They didn't make a third entry of the Golden Sun series until 8 years after the Lost Age, and it's been 4 years since Dark Dawn. While Dark Dawn got decent reviews (79 on meta critic) in general it didn't stand out as the fantastic RPG that the first 2 Golden Sun games were accepted as. Many people felt it was stale in comparison, and I personally felt that it lacked the feeling of exploration that the first 2 has, and it was incredibly linear.   On the other hand, they did end Dark Dawn on a cliff hanger, they wouldn't have done that unless they were planning on a fourth game...Or they couldn't think of a better way to end it so they left it open ended.   That being said, there is very strong evidence that we won't be receiving another Golden Sun title. The company is clearly still breathing, and 4 years is a long time to wait to put out a sequel. I don't know how long it took them to make Dark Dawn, I would guess they started a few years after the lost age had ended and the DS had taken off, but I also suspect that if Golden Sun 4 was in development, they would have been working on it while Dark Dawn was being released.   Basically what I'm trying to say is, if an established company like Camelot was working on another Golden Sun game, it would have come out by now. Now I completely how I'm wrong. If they're taking extra time to make the game great, fantastic. But the fact that we haven't heard ANYTHING does not bode well."
GoldenSun,2uczbt,Animedingo,6,Sun Feb 1 06:54:09 2015 UTC,"Well, Camelot had said that they consider the series quite special. Thus, they wont rush the title and take their time making it. Granted this was before Dark Dawn, but I imagine the sentient must be still there."
GoldenSun,2uczbt,KazyX,8,Sun Feb 1 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"Golden Sun was oddly special. I'm not a huge fan of JRPGS like dragon quest, or final fantasy, but Golden Sun was...unique. I loved how you could use Psynergy in the field to solve puzzles and discover secrets. I loved how you had to explore the world in order to find out what to do, or talk to towns people to learn about rumors.   Dark Dawn honestly felt like too much. It rushed you into an 8 member party, it didn't let you really explore the entire world, only in sections (not to mention if you miss a djinn you're just fucked) and the psynergy in the field didn't really feel...natural. It felt forced and situational. Of course it was situational in the first golden sun games, but like, remember the part where you had to place your friends in the crowd to help isaac cheat? That was fucking awesome, you had so much choice and freedom to do it how you wanted. There was nothing like that in dark dawn my knowledge/memory."
GoldenSun,2uczbt,Animedingo,5,Sun Feb 1 07:03:55 2015 UTC,"Well, Camelot had said that they consider the series quite special.   Baffled at how they feel this way and then... Dark Dawn :|"
GoldenSun,2uczbt,zonine,4,Sun Feb 1 09:28:10 2015 UTC,"They work on many other games, such as mario tennis and mario golf. They are very much alive, just not necessarily working on a golden sun game."
GoldenSun,2u6fmj,Coaltergeist,3,Fri Jan 30 07:57:52 2015 UTC,At least someone acknowledges Isaac's potential!!!
GoldenSun,2u6fmj,isaac3000,5,Sun Feb 1 00:46:42 2015 UTC,"If anything I'd actually prefer Isaac in PM than in Smash4.  I'm not particularly impressed with how Nintendo has handled the movesets for the new characters and, obviously, melee mechanics make everything more fun :)"
GoldenSun,2u6fmj,synapsii,4,Fri Jan 30 21:03:06 2015 UTC,I'd rather him be in Sm4sh for him to gain more recognition. Give him the Pit treatment from Brawl maybe

GoldenSun,2r7ekd,CheckmateChuck,5,Sat Jan 3 14:37:34 2015 UTC,Thanks for posting and keeping us up to date. (Is it just me or has golden sun been getting more popular again?)
GoldenSun,2r7ekd,tinytim0,5,Sun Jan 4 01:03:05 2015 UTC,"Apparently so. It seems this all started with Isaac's growing popularity as a possible newcomer for Smash 4 over the past year. A lot of people rediscovered their love for the series and this can only be a good thing.  Keep in mind, this is merely a simple Smash Bros.-nerd's point of view. The fact that Isaac is both a confirmed newcomer in Super Smash Flash, which will even be shown at Apex 15 in the end of January, and topped each and every one of the ""Who do you want as a newcomer""-popularity polls for Project M, which if you don't know is an extremely popular hack to make Brawl feel different competitively, didn't hurt the reinvigorated love for Golden Sun either.  Also, Benjamin does a fantastic job with those arrangements. I felt obligated to at least try and do everything I can to make more people see them."
GoldenSun,2r7ekd,tinytim0,1 point,Sun Jan 4 06:57:20 2015 UTC,"Woah, woah, woah.  Isaac was confirmed?"
GoldenSun,2r7ekd,_Falgor_,3,Sun Jan 4 09:00:49 2015 UTC,"In Smash Flash 2, yes. He even had his very own Newcomer-trailer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEALEiiYtjI (I haven't found a video with just the trailer, but hey, this gotta make do.)  In terms of the actual Smash, people are still rooting for him over at Smashboards. DLC is a very real possibility and Isaac is one of the fan favourites, being topped only by King K. Rool in terms of hits and answers in his support thread."
GoldenSun,2r6yol,_Falgor_,6,Sat Jan 3 09:53:25 2015 UTC,"When I saw this on 9gag, I thought that people here could be interested. The post gathered more than 10000 points (upvotes), and the comments show that a lot of people still love the series.  I tried to speak about #GoldenSunday, so if by any chance you're on 9gag, maybe try to help my comment being seen there? My username is ""falgor"" too. As you can see, we are not alone, and we need to gather."
GoldenSun,2r6yol,NZTau,3,Sat Jan 3 09:58:18 2015 UTC,"That's weird, I made this thread on reddit not too long ago, same picture & everything haha.  9gag aye, totally ripped me off haha. Ah well, more exposure is always good."
GoldenSun,2r18o3,belfrybandit,10,Thu Jan 1 20:50:19 2015 UTC,"There are no permanently ""missable"" Djinn in GS1 or TLA. There are in Dark Dawn, however.   In regards to GS1 and the Djinn in Mogall Forest, I'm not sure if you can backtrack through the forest, but after you cross the Karagoll Sea on the Tolbi-bound ship, there is a cave that allows you to reach Kalay. From there you can walk your way back to Fuchin Temple and get the Force Orb (which is also useful in TLA)."
GoldenSun,2r18o3,Alsenis,-9,Thu Jan 1 21:11:15 2015 UTC,is that even an answer? He want to know how he can get back to the falls and get the Psynergy needed to shove the log in the fighting school and you scramble on about Djinns.   And you can ignore that for now and continue the story. There comes a point where the bridge between Kalay and Vault is fixed and you can around again and get everything you want.
GoldenSun,2r18o3,MrChocodemon,6,Thu Jan 1 23:01:53 2015 UTC,He asked if there's any way to backtrack through Mogall Forest because he missed a Djinn and I replied that I don't know of any surefire way to do so. I then said that he can later return to the area to get anything he missed which is essentially what you said.
GoldenSun,2r18o3,Alsenis,8,Thu Jan 1 23:40:38 2015 UTC,"sorry, missread something there -.- my fault"
GoldenSun,2r18o3,MrChocodemon,2,Fri Jan 2 02:23:10 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, you can get past Xian without Force; that's actually how I did it in my first playthrough. You get what's possibly (IMO) one of the funniest scenes in the first game when you do so."

GoldenSun,2r18o3,Miva26,1 point,Tue Jan 6 12:29:30 2015 UTC,Sorry is a bit late on this thread but I can confirm you can back track and retrieve Quartz but only by playing through to Kalay. I retreated out and walked back to Kalay rather than exiting the forest a second time. There is no way to back track through the forest once you exit it the first time (a log you push into the river to jump at the end gets reset so you can't go back)

On one hand, there's nothing wrong with that, and curvy, well endowed women do deserve a spot in modern media, however if I had to take a guess, based on that thin waist, that this was intended as fan service"

GoldenSun,2qq5fi,subpubescenthair,5,Mon Dec 29 17:28:13 2014 UTC,"The Legend of Heros series is a traditional JRPG with more character development like GS.  It definitely starts off slower though, but once it gets into it the story really takes off.  It also has a somewhat unique fighting style."

GoldenSun,2qq5fi,Gamecubeboy,5,Mon Dec 29 21:44:00 2014 UTC,"Can you describe what exactly about the Golden Sun games that you liked so much? (I understand if it's everything, but specificity always helps.)   Personally, something I miss from the series that I'm just not finding in some other games was the puzzle elements. Even though in Golden Sun they were little more than gates, I thought it was nicely done to work the game's magical abilities into environmental puzzles.  Because many JRPGs have similar elements, being able to pick out what you're really looking for is important to finding something you like.  If you're really desperate, you can always check out /r/JRPG."
GoldenSun,2qq5fi,PhatBoiRL,2,Mon Dec 29 19:58:00 2014 UTC,"Well for me the best aspects of GS was the story and the psynergy powers. While I enjoyed the Djinn and the other secrets (honestly, its the only game where i actually wanted to collect everything), its the story and the way psynergy was used outside of the battles. Granted, everything was awesome about it, but I tried to narrow it down."

GoldenSun,2qq5fi,jack0191,1 point,Tue Dec 30 04:27:00 2014 UTC,"There's Glory of Hercales on the DS.  It was a really fun experience, but it has a gimmick with casting magic.  When you cast, you can choose auto or manual casting.  If you do auto, the spell does 100% damage, but if you do manual, you get a short mini-game type thing where you can increase the damage.  Here's an example.  Each element is a different game, so there's a good variety.  I don't hate this gimmick, but it does make battles longer."

They're not too similar but both follow the same format in a number of ways. 8 man party where you pick 4. Turn based battles. Standard JRPG features really.
GoldenSun,2qq5fi,Hyro22,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:25:07 2014 UTC,"Sounds interesting, hows the storyline, and is it open world?"
GoldenSun,2qq5fi,Wooollyhats,1 point,Mon Dec 29 23:31:36 2014 UTC,Storyline is ok. Kid is born into a mysterious Dragon clan (can turn into a Dragon in battles) and does the standard return peace to the land thing. Less dialogue heavy than GS but I enjoyed it okay. It's the same as GS in the world sense. Vast world map and then cities and forests dungeons etc that you can enter. Just keep a guide bookmarked because I guarantee you'll at some point have no idea where to go next and it will save you time!
GoldenSun,2qo4hl,kyzabro,2,Mon Dec 29 01:57:28 2014 UTC,Just an update. I found that Redbubble has a few shirts/prints/stickers for sale but not a huge range and not exactly super-interesting designs but it's there nevertheless.
GoldenSun,2qo4hl,zonine,1 point,Mon Dec 29 02:52:17 2014 UTC,Thanks for that. I hadn't even heard of redbubble. Some of the shirts are pretty good.

GoldenSun,2qo4hl,OctopodesoftheSea,1 point,Mon Dec 29 13:02:48 2014 UTC,"Redbubble for shirts. I got one from there; the printing, etc. was good quality.

GoldenSun,2qcd1o,Azynterrus,1 point,Thu Dec 25 07:58:43 2014 UTC,"Good work! I don't normally care for arrangements of video game music because they usually stray from the original style too much, but you did a good job of making this sound like a straightforward, higher-quality version of the same track, as if it could be used in a remake."
GoldenSun,2qcd1o,Nyuha,1 point,Thu Dec 25 09:28:23 2014 UTC,"Thank you!  I always try to stay as faithful as I can to the original whenever I do an arrangement of any kind.  I find it disrespectful to the original anytime someone takes way too many liberties and strays too far from the original idea.  I was tempted to call this a remaster, but decided against it because the original still sounded way better, in my opinion."
GoldenSun,2qc5oi,-Fender-,4,Thu Dec 25 03:58:56 2014 UTC,I think the great part about Golden Sun is that you can make whatever kind of party you want and it will work.
GoldenSun,2qc5oi,MaxLemon,2,Thu Dec 25 04:06:44 2014 UTC,"I agree. And in Hard Mode, there are fights that were actually difficult enough to encourage me to think tactics through in a way slightly deeper than ""Hit with Sword, Heal with Healer, Loop"". Or, later on, ""Use fodder Isaac party to unleash all summons in first two turns, let them die, then Hit with Sword, Heal with Healer, Loop"".  That was over a decade ago. When I play, I use a bit more tactics now. But I do enjoy building an overpowered party. Hence this post."
GoldenSun,2qc5oi,SustainedNotes,2,Thu Dec 25 04:13:13 2014 UTC,"Improved Build  ___________________________________________________________  ___________________________________________________________  Felix: Chaos Lord (2Ve, 7Ma)  Isaac: Master (4Ma, 5Ju)  Jenna: Ronin      (5Ve, 4Ju)  Sheba: Wizard    (7Me, 2Ju)  Garet: Master   (4Ve, 5Ju)  Piers: Oracle      (7Ve, 2Me)  Mia: Guru       (7Ma, 2Me)  Ivan: Wizard     (7Me, 2Ju)  ___________________________________________________________  Felix  Sol Blade [99% Unleash Rate]  Mythril Helm  Riot Gloves  Valkyrie Mail  Mythril Shirt  Hyper Boots  Isaac  Excalibur [94% Unleash Rate]  Mythril Helm  Riot Gloves  Mythril Clothes  Mythril Shirt  Hyper Boots  Jenna  Tisiphone Edge [97% Unleash Rate]  Demon Circlet  Riot Gloves  Mythril Clothes  Mythril Shirt  Hyper Boots  Cleric's Ring  Sheba  Lachesis' Rule [40% Unleash Rate]  Psychic Circlet  Leda's Bracelet  Iris Robe  Golden Shirt  Dragon Boots/Golden Boots  Garet  Excalibur [94% Unleash Rate]  Mythril Helm  Riot Gloves  Mythril Clothes  Mythril Shirt  Hyper Boots  Piers  Excalibur [94%/82% Unleash Rate].(varies based on helm)  Mythril Helm / Crown of Glory  Riot Gloves  Mythril Clothes  Mythril Shirt / Running Shirt  Hyper Boots  Mia  Lachesis' Rule [40% Unleash Rate]  Psychic Circlet  Clear Bracelet  Mysterious Robe  Mythril Shirt  Dragon Boots/Golden Boots  Ivan  Tisiphone Edge [35% Unleash Rate]  Psychic Circlet  Leda's Bracelet  Feathered Robe  Mythril Shirt  Dragon Boots  ___________________________________________________________  Main differences are that the new build doesn't use class-changing items, that Jenna isn't the main healer anymore (she is now rather fairly equal in melee strength to Garet, so I'm using her out of personal preference), and that Piers is no longer a main attacker. (He's now a backup Healer/Reviver, but one that still has strong melee strength.) Since I no longer have a Necromage, I have no more use for the Darksword, which allows me to use a Demon Circlet on Jenna. Sheba is also now my party's main healer, with Mia and Ivan as backups.   Furthermore, this class distribution is much less vulnerable to skills such as djinnfest. In my old one, if Isaac with a tomegathericon (or either of my other characters with class-changing items) were to be hit with such a skill and had all of his djinn on recovery, he might be stuck in his base class for a ridiculously large amount of turns, if the djinn of one element recover after the other two. The classes I chose here are better suited to survive such situations.  And well, that's mostly it. After spending quite a few hours trying to find better djinn distributions, and then looking for guides about what other people had considered optimal, I chose this one. Then I went to compare it to the one that /u/ExecutiveDave had previously suggested, and realized that it was the exact same one. So... props to him for that. As before, the items are what I personally consider to be the optimal options. Depending on the fight, one might want to switch the Hyper Boots to pairs of Dragon Boots, if the boss you're fighting uses a lot of elemental attacks.   A way to improve the gear would be to use the Trial Road glitch and duplicate your Guardian Ring to give one to everyone (except Jenna, if she's already using the Cleric's Ring). That glitch can also be used to duplicate your Dragon Boots, Hyper Boots, Golden Boots, Golden Ring, Spirit Ring, Leda's Bracelet, Feathered Robes, Mythril Shirt, Running Shirt, Clear Bracelet, Lucky Medals, Game Tickets, Potions, Mist Potions, Psy Crystals, Water of Lifes, etc. However, it can't be used on the Trident and stat-boosting items, and Mythril Silver, Dark Matter, Orihalcon, Riot Gloves, Golden Shirt, Sol Blade, Tisiphone Edge, Lachesis' Rule, Cleric's Ring, Valkyrie Mail, Mysterious Robe and Iris Robe aren't available before Trial Road, and therefore can't be duplicated.  Well, that's about it. Hope this helps someone else, and it was a pleasure to share with you guys."

GoldenSun,2qc5oi,ExecutiveDave,2,Thu Dec 25 20:42:54 2014 UTC,"I'll assume that this is an honest question. All you need to do is beat the game once, then make a new game. You'll get two options; the first is Easy Mode (which, if I recall, is just taking your clear data and making a new game using characters with the same stats and levels (so you could max every stat by making many, many new games in this mode and using the stat-boosting items)), and the second is Hard Mode (which appears if you say ""no"" to playing in Easy Mode).  In Hard Mode, you start again from level 1, and enemies are stronger. Dullahan in this mode is actually a challenge. If you've never tried it, I strongly suggest it. This is one of the features I liked most from TLA and which I found to be sorely lacking in DD."
GoldenSun,2qc5oi,ExecutiveDave,1 point,Thu Dec 25 21:05:16 2014 UTC,"I have an optimized one imo, where I placed 2 limiters on myself.  No 2 jobs can be the same and no duplicate weapon/armors between the entire cast."

GoldenSun,2q4doc,ApostleCorp,7,Tue Dec 23 22:49:48 2014 UTC,"From a gameplay standpoint, I want to be able to go back and catch Djinni I missed. /eye DD  I want to see Felix and find out what he's been up to, and to a lesser extent, Jenna and Sheba.   If there's going to be a cast of eight characters, the game needs to be long enough to accomplish decent character building (GS 1 and 2 took two games to develop eight characters, DD took one and IMO fell short on that front).  I want to find out more about Alex, how he went down the path he's chosen, what his motives actually are, and how he gained/discovered the knowledge that he has.  Most of all, I want 4 to complement 3 in such a way that all the iffy world building that was done in Dark Dawn makes sense and fits together as beautifully as games 1 and 2 did.  Lastly, I'm hoping we'll find out about Sheba's origins, and if the Tupparang city/ship is Anemos.  =D"
GoldenSun,2q4doc,zonine,4,Tue Dec 23 01:08:15 2014 UTC,"This right here hits most of my wants. Being locked off from half of the map, then having a full 8 people shoved into your party in a few short hours kind of ruined it for me.  The only thing Zonine missed for me is difficulty levels. The Lost Age at least had hard mode after you beat it (which was amazing). Dark Dawn was way too easy, and I was really hoping for a chance to replay it without beating every enemy with a few basic attacks. Too bad I never had that option.  As for plot, I'm not too picky. Plot was one of the few things Dark Dawn did absolutely right, though the first two were still better. I wouldn't mind seeing more on what happened when the lighthouses were first built, if they could make story about all the psynergy being locked away in the first place. That might be interesting."
GoldenSun,2q4doc,Moonpaw,1 point,Tue Dec 23 02:10:51 2014 UTC,"On top of having more difficulty in the fights (which should have been corrected with a hard mode that was honestly hard), I also want to get puzzles that are actually hard. Even if I have to spend 30 minutes in a single room without making any progress whatsoever, because I'm busting my brain trying to figure this out. And of course, that would mean not having your characters exposing exactly what is inside a room and how to solve it every single time it seems like there might be the slightest difficulty. That, and these long, unskippable dialogues where literally no information that wasn't obvious is exposed also ruined GS3 for me."

Wait, that's actually the story of GS and TLA"

GoldenSun,2q4doc,Wind123,5,Tue Dec 23 19:42:26 2014 UTC,"Graphically, I want to go back to GS 1/2. I know DD had it in places, and those menus were beautiful, but the overworld and town maps just looks awful. If they're going to do 3D again, do it on a device where the graphics won't look so pixelated. I also want more complicated puzzles. DD felt like they were dumbed down by a lot, and I can't recall any that felt they actually gave me a challenge.  There's so many reasons I go back and play the first two games over and over again. Dark Dawn I only played once. ONCE. I should probably give it another shot, but playing 1, 2, then 3... the last one is most certainly the weakest."
GoldenSun,2q4doc,SmokingMarmoset,3,Tue Dec 23 02:59:24 2014 UTC,"A plot that involves the characters in a more personal way would be nice. 1 and 2 were great, not just because of the world we were introduced to, but because each of the characters had a clear goal to achieve that then dragged them into the events of the world. I think 3 really failed in this area. We played as the characters we did for no other reason then 'oh look, they're related to x from the previous game. How cool'. Even the reason for their adventure began in a really weak setting, each character felt forced into the plot which really made it hard for me to get invested in the outcome of the game. For 4, I'd really like them to go back to what made the characters of 1 and 2 so memorable.  Making the game a lot more challenging would be nice too. I found the last to be far too easy"

GoldenSun,2q4doc,zonine,3,Tue Dec 23 01:27:23 2014 UTC,"I'd rather see a more intractable environment. Golden sun 1 and 2 had a LOT of stuff you could access by using different types of psynergy. Dark Dawn just didn't have that same feel. I mean it did have field psynergy, but it was almost all entirely used for puzzles and not exploration.   Like, in the first golden sun game, there was a djinn you could only get by bumping into a woman carrying a jar of water, and make her spill it in the right spot, so you can freeze it and you can hop across it.   Or the Donpa mission (I forget this name, but that guy holding Ivan's not dad), it was completely optional, it was entirely go get a Djinn, but you could only access it if you got the cloak orb, and went all the way back to it. It was these kinds of field things, side missions and otherwise not plot driven exploration that I really loved about the old games"
GoldenSun,2q4doc,Animedingo,2,Tue Dec 23 03:37:12 2014 UTC,"New spells and summons. Dark Dawn took a lot from the first two games and offered nothing new in terms of combat. New types of Psynergy in combat and new summons would go a long way to making combat more unique. Summons involving three types of djinn would make tri-elemental classes a lot more interesting.   Plot expansion and better character development. I'm sure we're gonna see more of the vortexes, but I don't want the plot to deviate the way Dark Dawn did. As for character development, Matthew, Kari's, Tyrell, and Rief had decent back story as well as Amiti, but the others felt kinda rushed. Also it'd be cool to have a Tuaparang soldier have a change of heart and join Matthew to defeat his own clan for the greater good.   I want to see more of what the original 8 heroes are up to. Felix and Piers mostly. It would be cool to see Lemuria in danger and having to help Piers save the city and possibly see him become the new leader of the Lemurians.   The Tuaparang. I want them to have an army threaten the world requiring other cities to unite and make their own army. It'd be cool to have Lemurians leave their city and unite with the outside world to defeat the Tuaparang. Maybe even infiltrate the home of the Tuaparang."

A lot of questions were left unanswered, like the nature of the Psynergy Vortexes, who the Tuaparang actually are and how Alex/Arcanus sealed an alliance with them.  Gameplay-wise, I would like to see more puzzles and the difficulty raised. It would also be cool if Camelot worked on the second half of the party you obtain (Himi, etc), because the characters lack depth, in my opinion."

I borrowed it from a friend in middle school after he had finished it. It was my introduction to the RPG genre (besides pokemon), and quickly became my favorite game of all time.   That friend happened to be from Japan and was able to buy a copy of TLA during his vacation. This was before I had internet access so I would bug him every day for spoilers. I remember him complaining about how he was ""stuck on a huge maze-like wind rock that had no boss just to get stupid reveal"" and about ""the impossible dragon boss that kept healing"" and the ""Hard wizard guy with lots of balls."""

Compared to every other game I had ever played it seemed vast. I was hooked when I saw the sailing. I got TLA as soon as it was released in my home country, then TBS and a strategy guide for my birthday that year."
GoldenSun,2q0ovd,Wind123,3,Mon Dec 22 11:45:54 2014 UTC,"I had never played a video game until I was 13. One day my father came back from a conference with an sp that he had won somehow. So the black and silver gameboy sp was my first system. The next day my neighbor brough over a video game for the sp for me to have; Golden Sun. He tried to explain to me what it was, (somehow he was under the impression that Kraden betrayed everyone in the end of the game lol), which I didn't follow very well so I started playing it myself. Loved it instantly.  TLDR: Golden Sun was my first and is still my favorite Video Game."
GoldenSun,2q0ovd,Raballer,3,Mon Dec 22 23:36:13 2014 UTC,"I started off on Dark Dawn a few years ago, when it first came out. It looked really cool and unique, and I enjoyed it semi-thoroughly (Except for the points of no return, which sucked balls).  It was actually only a month or two ago that I remembered the game. I had just discovered a really nice gba emulator for my phone, and was looking for more games to add to my collection. I remembered when I was playing DD, and I wanted to play the original games to get the full experience DD referred to. It was already a little spoiled, since DD has a lot of lore that details the main events, but I was still unprepared for the upcoming experience.  I finished the original game in a week or two, totaling 37 hours or so. Right now I'm playing through TLA, with about 21 hours of playtime. I've tried recommending it to everyone I can, since it's SO FRIGGIN GOOD. Now that we're on our winter break, many a sleepless night have been split between TLA and binge watching The Legend of Korra.  I just love everything about it; the game design, the story, the puzzles, the way it subtly teaches you how to play, the clear effort put into it... I feel like a kid again just running through this. If I had another 60-70 hours of my life to throw at these two games alone I'd do it in a heartbeat.  My only regret is that I am now entrenched into another agonizing half-life-3-esque wait for the fourth game. But it's still worth every minute."

GoldenSun,2q0ovd,BlueVelvet90,1 point,Sun Apr 26 06:20:19 2015 UTC,"For a long time, starting in the late 90s, I was subscribed to Nintendo Power magazine (sadly discontinued now). When the Gameboy Advance released in 2001, there was an offshoot of of NP called Nintendo Power Advance dedicated to GBA news and player's guides that NP subscribers got for free (I think there were only 2 or 3 issues). The very first issue of NPA came out just prior to the release of the GBA and featured an article on an upcoming game called Golden Sun that demonstrated the processing power of the GBA. Being a fan of old school JRPGs, I was blown away by the screenshots published in that magazine. I was amazed that a handheld console could look as good if not better than the Super Nintendo. I followed Golden Sun news as closely as I could with the internet still in its adolescence, and I grabbed a copy right around launch day. I have been a fan ever since. I sort of forgot about the series for a while, but I found a copy of Dark Dawn for cheap a little while ago, and started playing through the first two games again so I could finally get through the DS game that I never got the chance to play. I finished the first two and finally started in on Dark Dawn, and I am hooked again.

Ivan: Kikuichimonji and Swift sword, Lucky cap, Spirit armlet, Feathered robe, Hyper boots, Mythril shirt.  Mia: Blessed mace, Mythril circlet, virtuous armlet, Feathered robe, Quick boots, Running shirt.  alternatively swap isaac and Garets djinn in the same way and give Garet the Wicked mace."
GoldenSun,2np9v8,hcnye,3,Fri Nov 28 21:43:26 2014 UTC,"Ok, while this answer may or may not be super helpful, know that you can beat the game running straight mono-elemental classes (all djinn as the same element as the character.)   That being said, it's a lot of fun to play around with people's classes once you have the djinn to do such a thing. There ways to ""optimize"" djinn distribution for stats, but know that it is by no means necessary to do such a thing in order to complete the game and you won't really be penalized too roughly for it, within reason of course (no healer, or some such)."

A Character class is a gameplay-based method many RPGs use to arbitrate the capabilities of playable characters. In Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age, character classes serve just this purpose, dictating enhancements to characters' base statistics and what arrangements and elements of Psynergy they may use. Unlike many RPGs, such as Final Fantasy, characters in Golden Sun games do not specifically select classes to pursue and develop abilities in; Classes are merely ""settings"" that can be instantly changed anytime based on what their level of skill in a particular element is.

GoldenSun,2n5ywj,Tall-Guy,3,Sun Nov 23 13:49:42 2014 UTC,"The only ""point of no return"" in the game is after you defeat the final boss atop Venus Lighthouse. If you don't do that, you can literally complete the game up to that one boss fight, turn around and go anywhere you want.   The game does not auto save. You can fight Deadbeard as long as you have all the necessary Psynergy to complete Crossbone Isle.   Try to be close to level 30. At that point Deadbeard is relatively manageable.   Up to you how you use your boosters. Just make sure you allocate the stats appropriately. Garet is naturally bulkier than the rest and hits pretty hard, but lacks a lot of PP with just Fire Djinn. Switch up your party's Djinn and decide which class you want on each fighter and then assign the stat boosts. Don't give a weak physical attacker Attack boosts if they're just gonna be casting the entire time though.   As for healers, unless you're comfortable with everyone having unique classes by switching up the Djinn, keep Mia as a healer with all Water Djinn.   After Crossbone Isle, I doubt you'll be much higher than 30ish unless you grinded really hard earlier. Its fine to keep them at that level. When you transfer them, Felix's party will be around that same level more or less so its not like Isaac's crew will be OP in TLA."
GoldenSun,2n5ywj,Alsenis,2,Sun Nov 23 19:35:56 2014 UTC,"First, there isn't really a point of no return. You can get back.  Second, yes you can save, defeat deadbeard, and reload (but I really wouldn't worry about being overleveled).  Use the stat items on whoever you want, it rarely matters a whole lot. Check gamefaqs if you're wondering if there's something you might have missed in an area. Really, don't worry too much about missing things other than djinn (you can get some decent stuff via monster drops and lucky medals, but by the time you'd get it back in TLA it's not so amazing anymore).  Level 30 isn't overleveled, really (I usually finish in the 25-27 range, but I also like casting avoid and don't grind)."

GoldenSun,2n5ywj,Irish-king,1 point,Mon Nov 24 01:27:15 2014 UTC,"A tactic I use on deadbeard, the boss in crossbone is to alternately use issac and garet to cast granite and flash, Ivan cast luff, and use Mia to do all the offensive work like djinn and summons, with the odd healing now and then. Luff seals his psynergy which forces him to attack. It does take some time to beat him but I done this at a really low level, mid 20's I think."

Also, I understand that you want to wait to open-source this until you are confident with your game architecture. However, it might be useful to release (parts of) your architecture and ask for feedback to those developers who might be willing to contribute. Not only might this speed up the process, but it might also avoid you from forgetting to support certain aspects in the game that you might not have thought of. Even should you not like the feedback you get you can still decide to ignore it; In the end it's you who makes the decisions, so you don't need to fear that people will contribute hacky code or that it doesn't keep future changes into account. I feel like other people in this thread share this thought, but of course we can't force you if you don't want to ;)  Anyway, thought I had to share my opinion - sorry for the long post :p"

GoldenSun,2mvhva,themrfarquad,2,Sat Dec 13 02:23:51 2014 UTC,"As someone who is currently creating an ARPG engine from the ground up I would like first of all to congratulate you on the work you have done so far, if it weren't for the lack of NPC's and character displayed on screen I might have thought this the original. Second I would like to enquire as to how you chose to implement layering.  For 2D games the original GBA titles were very aware of the third dimension and I have to admit struggling to implement a similar looking system in my engine. Currently I am using discrete layers but I am thinking of changing this so that all objects and tiles are fully aware of their 3D positions. Like I said above, I'm curious about how you have tackled this issue and any insights into your methodology would be greatly appreciated."
GoldenSun,2mvhva,Xephiroso,1 point,Sat Dec 13 03:05:54 2014 UTC,"I generally create layers that follow this description and are drawn in this order:   Base layer, drawn before all sprites Before layer, drawn before all sprites and after base layer (could have multiple before layers) Priorities layer, drawn after doing a sort of all prioritized items by layer level (what collision level they are on) and bottom y-coordinate.   Priorities layer includes portions of the map that need to be drawn in a specific order depending on where sprites are (i.e. the bridge, since you can be under or on it). This is where my layer level value comes into play.  After layer, drawn after all sprites and priorities (could have multiple after layers)"

GoldenSun,2mvhva,Lockhart665,2,Sat Dec 13 04:40:14 2014 UTC,"Keep up the good work, and good luck! When you get to a point where you need help, please post on here! I don't know anything about coding or software, but I'd like to help out how I can.  I share your feelings on Dark Dawn somewhat. It wasn't bad, but it was definitely a letdown. They went up to 8 characters too fast, and it was way too easy. Seriously, I spent most of the game just using the regular attacks to get through, and the boss battles ended depressingly fast. I'm pretty sure I only ever had one person get downed in the entire playthrough? Could have used a hard mode, like in TLA."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Poppythehero,20,Sat Nov 15 20:41:51 2014 UTC,"I never saw the game as a bad game. Alone, the game is actually pretty decent in my opinion. However, as someone who played the first two games religiously, Dark Dawn was kind of a let down.   The storyline started off pretty cool. You have the introduction of Psynergy Vortexes which are clearly a huge threat. Then you go off to find a way to stop them much like Isaac did to stop Saturos and Menardi. We have Blados and Chalice to be our villainous duo along with a mysterious Mercury Adept. Not entirely original there (it was very obvious who it was). Then the story veers off to stop the Tuaparang and we completely forget about the vortexes unt the very end of the game.   Now look at the gameplay. Very similar to the previous games which I loved. However, very little was added apart from visual effects. Then look at the summons; I was very annoyed that only ONE summon was added. The game wasn't released until 2010; in that time, I would have hoped that Camelot would have given us a few cool new summons (I wasn't expecting like 10, but 4 new summons would have been great).   If you look at the game on its own and picture it as the first of its kind (or first GS game for someone), the game definitely has its merits apart from being a little easy (a hard difficulty would be nice). However, a lot of the fan base has already played the first two games and have  much higher standards which Dark Dawn just simply could not meet."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Alsenis,10,Sat Nov 15 21:45:13 2014 UTC,"Points of no return were stupid because there was no real reason for them, other than to fuck those over who played the series before, because there weren't points of no return.  Game felt super short. After you get the ship, it seems like you have to do one or two things, get the umbra gear, and then the game was like over.  The game was also way too easy. Golden Sun 1 and 2 were easy I guess, but not THAT easy.  There were also a lack of places to explore. In Golden Sun 1 and 2 if you wanted those extra summons, you had to go out of your way to find them, which was cool. Even the Djinns required some hunting.  In this game, the Djinn and the Tablets were in obvious spots.  Haven't played the game in a while, but that's just off the top of my head. I'm sure I can think of more complaints if I tried.  Edit: Typos"
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Chronotakular,8,Sat Nov 15 20:51:38 2014 UTC,"Don't forget shoving 8 NEW characters into one game, as opposed to the first two, which introduced 4 each.  Himi shows up late as some kind of deus ex machina person after you get the Third Eye from Warrior's Hill."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,radios_appear,1 point,Sun Nov 16 00:15:58 2014 UTC,"True, but that didn't strike me as badly, because Golden Sun 2 had 8 characters, but I guess we knew both parties pretty well by the time we started the second game."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Chronotakular,5,Sun Nov 16 04:22:34 2014 UTC,"They gave us a full game to learn one group, and an equivalently long time to learn a second group.

GoldenSun,2meoh0,AManHasSpoken,5,Sun Nov 16 17:04:37 2014 UTC,"I think Chronotakular and Alsenis sum it up well. I don't think Dark Dawn is a bad game; I had a lot of fun with it. But it doesn't compare well to the first two. The plot seemed to forget about psynergy vortexes until the very end, the combat and puzzles were by and large too easy, and the points of no return were just frustrating for a game that rewards you for collecting all the djinn."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Novusuna,3,Sat Nov 15 22:09:43 2014 UTC,"It is the worse of the three, but you need to keep in mind how good GS1&2 is."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,TheGamedawg,2,Sat Nov 15 23:07:43 2014 UTC,"I thought it was ok. Like Chronotakular said, I thought it was really easy. It was especially easy to grind all of your characters up to level 100 (which I did) in the area just before fighting the final boss (Chaos Chimera), which I thought ruined the challenge a little bit. That also wrecked the challenge of fighting the optional bosses Trolls, Dullahan, Star Magician, and Ancient Demon. I was also upset that they didn't have vs mode between DSs.  Overall the game didn't meet any of my expectations, but I'm just glad we got another Golden Sun game."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Nokel,2,Sat Nov 15 21:32:16 2014 UTC,"OK I see GG:DD is like breath of fire 5 were it failed to live up to the lofty goals its predecessors set for it. I get what your saying GGDD was to linear, the plot could have been more thought out, the game is to short, and all that but it's not a bad game.  Either way i still think the game still holds up though the characters are good and the presentation great for the DS. The battle system's Great too. (i guess they had the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" mentality) .I'm only half way through the original golden sun and a haven't even started the lost age but this series seems like a good time and i appreciate your answers.

GoldenSun,2meoh0,OctopodesoftheSea,2,Sun Nov 16 00:17:54 2014 UTC,"I didn't think it was terrible, but for me it didn't match up to the first two. It had the weaknesses of the first two - for example, there was a lot of really talky exposition - plus some more.  -The plot felt kind of all over the place. We're getting a feather, now we're doing something else, oh wait, there are these vortexes popping up everywhere but nvm, let's talk for five hours about something unrelated...  -I think the expansion of the party to eight Adepts so quickly really didn't give everyone a chance for proper character development. It felt pretty crowded, and kind of redundant.   -For me, one of the biggest issues was it didn't have the same feel as the first two. The world changed so dramatically in 30 years, there was so much new stuff everywhere, and to me at least it didn't really feel connected to the old world. All these kingdoms we'd never heard of just kind of popped up overnight, all this new technology, etc.  Unlike others, I didn't much mind the points of no return, but I didn't think the rest of it was as good as the other games."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Dracobolt,2,Sun Nov 16 00:19:09 2014 UTC,"It's a decent game, but it's not a Golden Sun game. It's like bad fanfic game of Golden Sun. For people who really liked the lore of the first two games, it was aggravating because it trampled a lot of that."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,MrCata,2,Sun Nov 16 06:40:14 2014 UTC,"I think it may be just me, but weyard didnt seem as vast as the first two games. In golden sun most of the towns seemed so different, but similar compared to which region you were in, and all of them had their own traditions to them.   In LA when you started hopping from continent to continent and island to island, there were different cultures and people acted vastly different from each other, and what really got me was the Mars lighthouse village (cant remember the name) was exactly how I sort of imagined it would be when I got to know a little about saturos and menardi.  DD to me seemed that when traveling around all the towns looked way too different to me, and the NPCs all had the same personality, like almost everyone was generic.  Also furryville made me angry because it almost seemed like the story behind it was made up on the spot.  One thing I did like about DD was how the story started, they went on a journey that seemed simple enough to do. Not like an epic journey but like a coming of age sort of thing to fix the mistake Tyrell made."

GoldenSun,2meoh0,ProperlyBasic,1 point,Sun Nov 16 00:46:00 2014 UTC,"On its own it was a decent game. However, compared to the first two it doesn't develop combat, make puzzles easier, has poor character development, bad dialogue (why do all 8 characters need to react vocally to everything?), and a confusing story.   You might say that I shouldn't compare it to the first game, but how could I not with all the blatant references, identical mechanics, etc all pointing to the first games (either for legitimacy or nostalgia)?"
GoldenSun,2meoh0,synapsii,1 point,Sun Nov 16 03:19:59 2014 UTC,"DD was a step back from GS1/2 in too many ways that its small innovations couldn't make up for it.  As a standalone, it's not a bad game.  It's not a good GS game."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,tinytim0,1 point,Sun Nov 16 07:37:10 2014 UTC,"I thought it was really good, my only pet leaves are pretty much the ones everyone else has.   It's too easy. Points of no return. Too many characters too fast. The story seems to take a weird side turn for no reason.  (The least the could have done was add a couple more vortices throughout the last 3/4 of the game.)   And my own personal one.   The over world looked, in my opinion, horrendous.  But in contrast, I absolutely loved how all the cities/towns/dungeons looked when you got to explore (Except how obvious it was what objects could be interacted with, I mean, in the first two it wasn't that obvious).   But those are pretty much it."
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Wooollyhats,1 point,Mon Dec 8 08:49:57 2014 UTC,"It was quite good honestly. The key thing here though, is that we're comparing it to golden sun, not some other game. Dark dawn was 'pretty good!', whereas its predecessors were 'phenomenal!', so it's judged a lot harder.  The points of no return were what completely turned me off of the game, personally. It had no replayability - I typically went djinn hunting after beating the game, and being unable to do so in dark dawn pissed me off"
GoldenSun,2meoh0,Coaltergeist,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"I felt that it suffered from Chrono Chross Syndrome; too many characters, not enough development. I also didn't really like how pretty much the entire game was a sidequest. I never understood why they added places like Passaj which theoretically were in the first game but were never shown. Also, Points of no Return can suck many sets of dicks. Little changes like the retconning of bits of lore and locations, as well as half of the map being off limits bothered me too. All in all, the game is still very nostalgic for me, seeing as it delivers that Golden Sun formula of gameplay better than ever. Overall I see it as a decent game and a great RPG, just not the sequel the series deserved."

GoldenSun,2m8krv,Alsenis,5,Fri Nov 14 01:02:43 2014 UTC,There are now two GS songs in the game. In Brawl they put one GS song and made Isaac an assist trophy. Clearly this means that two songs will give us Isaac as a playable character.

If there was something to unlock, they most probably would have unlocked it already.  To me, it's the biggest sign of all. Why bother to include a new Golden Sun track to cut the most important representation of the series? It's a sign that Isaac is probably considered for DLC, at the very least.

They would concern things such as giving Sean and Ouranos a larger role, perhaps as recurring characters, in order to not make them sound out of place when they vouch for you, or making the pirates in Alhafra do something after setting off for their new pirate leader, Isaac. Perhaps I might go so far as to add cities or ruins not present in either game but that existed in DD as optional places to visit, or add references to the plot of DD in order to bring the third game into a more cohesive whole.  And I'd frankly like to make Taopo Swamp deeper, I didn't really like the top part, but after you get a ways down, then it just keeps going and going, and then you get a Star dust at the end.  It was one of those moments to me where I felt like I wasn't following a set story, and something awesome happened.  Also, most of the golden sun cast could use a little more character development.  These are just a few of my ideas though."
GoldenSun,2lr6s1,tinytim0,1 point,Mon Dec 8 09:59:17 2014 UTC,"This sounds very interesting! Hopefully after finals, I can try and teach myself how to start working on the game. I may not be that great in terms of story, but I'd like to be able to learn the software side of it."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,_Falgor_,10,Sat Nov 8 05:04:59 2014 UTC,"The Battle Scene / Final Boss theme from The Lost Age is still one of the songs on the Norfair stage.  Edit/Note: If you don't want to look all the video, look at 2:24.  On a side note, there's still no trace of Isaac in the Wii U version:   Some Canadians received the game earlier from Nintendo, of course with some limitations on what they can say about the game, but they can talk about Assist Trophies. However if Isaac's still a hidden AT, they probably don't have unlocked him already.  If he were to be missing again, it would pretty surely mean he's planned as DLC. If he's still an AT, there would still be hope for Matthew, but it would be less likely."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,Animedingo,5,Sat Nov 8 05:10:57 2014 UTC,"Considering the poor reviews for dark dawn, and the fact that there's no sign of a golden sun game in sight, I don't think isaac as a character, let a lone mathew is in the future."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,ProperlyBasic,3,Sat Nov 8 07:29:42 2014 UTC,"Definitely not Matthew, but Golden Sun is on the Wii U virtual console. It's a stretch, I know, but I haven't given up hope yet. Mewtwo as DLC opened up a world of possibilities."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,Animedingo,4,Sat Nov 8 18:06:36 2014 UTC,"Everyone says Dark Dawn is bad, but it's not. It wasn't as good as the GBA games, but it wasn't a bad game. And I think that if Camelot were to make GS4, they would handle it better because they have a lot of feedback available on Internet.  If ONE mild game is enough to cut the possibility of being playable in Smash Bros, I don't think the roster would be that big. Or even if it would have any character.  Isaac deserves a place (and he deserves a place since at least Brawl), if he's still not in the game now that DLC are a thing, I'll stay on my opinion that Sakurai has its favorites."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,Animedingo,1 point,Sat Nov 8 22:43:06 2014 UTC,"It's not JUST that Dark Dawn wasn't the best golden sun game. It's the lack of news for Golden Sun. The only new golden sun ANYTHING we've had in the last year, was Golden sun GBA coming to wiiU. Thats it.   Dark Dawn came out almost 4 years ago! and it was 7 years between lost age and dark dawn, frankly I'm surprised we got dark dawn at all. The reason why we're not going to get any new Golden sun content in Smash, aside from maybe a regular trophy, or at the very most an assist trophy, is because nobody is making new golden sun anything."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,radios_appear,1 point,Sat Nov 8 23:09:40 2014 UTC,"It is logical. Camelot is not a big studio, so they can't make a video game really fast. And they have to make Mario spin-offs.  But you seem to know what they're going to do very well, do you personally know them or what? I don't think you know anything more than us, so it's just assumptions.  And Golden Sun 4 put aside, it's not Camelot who's in charge, it's Sakurai. He is the main reason we still have nothing new for Golden Sun in Smash 4, since he takes the decisions."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,Animedingo,-1,Sat Nov 8 23:47:17 2014 UTC,"We may have an equal amount of knowledge about camelot's plans, but I have evidence. it's like arguing christianity vs atheism. Obviously there's more evidence for something NOT happening then there is for something that only has assumptions"
GoldenSun,2lnf26,Animedingo,1 point,Sun Nov 9 00:01:30 2014 UTC,"Evidence? Go on, show us where you saw that no Golden Sun game will ever be made again.  The lack of evidence in any sense doesn't mean what you think is right. Remember before the announcement of Dark Dawn? We had no evidence either. Yet, Dark Dawn exists.  Edit: Still waiting for an answer, but I guess I've made my point. We don't need no pessimism."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,Raballer,1 point,Sun Nov 9 00:06:33 2014 UTC,"I would agree. It's a fever dream to expect a new game now, after the poor reception to the last one.   It's just something that happens. If you can't make a game that gets the masses excited about your product, some other company and IP will try and get the job done."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,Rikuthemaster,1 point,Sun Nov 9 21:20:21 2014 UTC,"You got it the wrong way, Dark Dawn got out after Brawl.  And like I said, if one average game was enough to stop a series, the video game industry would already be dead.  Our community is WAY too grim (And it's really ironic for the community of a game with ""Sun"" in its name to be so gloomy). If we keep staying so silent, for sure the series will end. We'd need to show Camelot and Nintendo that we're still here and waiting."
GoldenSun,2lnf26,kakirono,0,Sun Nov 9 21:36:33 2014 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with being realistic about the fate of this series. It had a great couple of games, and one decent return, and it would not be the end of the world to not have another title.   Also it's not really irony, Golden Sun actually has a somewhat dark atmosphere, or rather not really a cheerful one, so there's real no association between the fan base being ""grim"" and the word sun being in the title"
GoldenSun,2lhtp5,jacoblovejordan,4,Thu Nov 6 18:04:27 2014 UTC,Our next step is pretty much wait another 5 years until another Golden Sun is made and hopefully it will be amazing.

GoldenSun,2lhtp5,EpicJupiter09,2,Tue Nov 11 09:45:48 2014 UTC,"Go for it. Who knows, you might love it. And if you don't then that's okay too. It's a fun game even if it wasn't as great as the gba two."
GoldenSun,2ldphd,NeroFerk,3,Wed Nov 5 16:50:03 2014 UTC,"It's been years since I played golden sun, but if I remember correctly, you do only get one chance with many djinn and there's a good chance you'll miss a few"
GoldenSun,2ldphd,the_Makeshift,2,Thu Nov 6 06:20:48 2014 UTC,I think the DS version is the only one that has Djinn you can't get later in the game.   In de original and The Lost Age you can go back and get them all at any point.
GoldenSun,2ldphd,Novusuna,1 point,Thu Nov 6 10:45:53 2014 UTC,"This is correct, and it's one of my biggest gripes with Dark Dawn, despite not hating it as much as some people on the sub do.  As for OP, any unique item you drop or sell can be bought back from a store. (As you've already discovered) Very handy with the limited inventory."
GoldenSun,2kvdh2,acat493,15,Fri Oct 31 10:04:47 2014 UTC,"Personally I never ran from a fight in GS, it's important to grind for boss fights so you're making life easier on yourself"
GoldenSun,2kvdh2,calum93,7,Fri Oct 31 13:27:00 2014 UTC,"Garet can make a great tank, and his summons are pretty awesome. Alot of his fire spells and some of hire fire djinni can boost defense in the party as well. Think of it this way.  Isaac: Damage dealer DPS. Garet: Buffing tank. Ivan: Spellcaster DPS. Mia: Buffing healer.  Obviously the best thing about Golden sun is that you can mix up characters a bit, but if you want to play them in their basics that's how it is."
GoldenSun,2kvdh2,muffinsformen,6,Fri Oct 31 10:18:48 2014 UTC,So my decision to put a lot of armour on Garet was good? YES!
GoldenSun,2kvdh2,Oddyesy,4,Fri Oct 31 10:20:46 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you're good. Later on he's a pretty good Samurai. On fleeing: It's just the RNG, you must just be unlucky. There's a way to manipulate the RNG in this game, but it's hardly worth it just to get first try flees."
GoldenSun,2kvdh2,kurosaur,7,Fri Oct 31 11:08:08 2014 UTC,DON'T flee. Fleeing from random encounters will practically guarantee that you'll have to grind random encounters later in the game for levels for hard boss fights.
GoldenSun,2kvdh2,MuckYu,6,Fri Oct 31 14:39:48 2014 UTC,"The Bilibin/Imil/Kolima portion of the game is the only part of the game where I had to level-grind, but that's because I usually like to beat half of the Mercury Lighthouse first, so I have Mia for Kolima Forest (she has some dialogue programmed for there, even though you're supposed to go there before Imil).  If you're taking the random encounters each time they come, you'll be in good shape for when your first couple of boss fights turn up.  Garet's primary purpose is to put out a lot of physical damage early on in the game. As a fire-type warrior adept, he has really good attack and defense, but his psynergy is drained pretty quickly since he has a pretty small PP pool.  Conserve Garet's psynergy for heavier-duty targets, and have him do standard attacks on weaker monsters. At the moment, you should have his first Djinni, Forge, from the Goma Cave. Forge is a buff Djinni, providing everyone in the party with a temporary boost in attack power. Later you'll get Fever and others. Most of GS1's fire Djinn are attack Djinn, but your ace in the hole late in the game will be Flash, which is a defense buff Djinni that blocks 90% of incoming damage for the turn it is used, and it always takes priority, so using it will always protect your party.  While you still have only Isaac, Garet, and Ivan, your general strategy for more difficult fights will generally have Isaac using Cure to heal, Garet using his Djinn(i) and attacking, and Ivan using his psynergy. Though to take the healing burden off of Isaac (so you don't run him out of PP too quickly), distribute herbs and other medicinal items throughout the party.  Once you get Mia, Isaac and Garet will both take a damage role. Isaac's Ragnarok and Garet's Heat Wave attacks do a lot of damage against single targets. Use Ivan and Mia for multi-target attacks and use Mia for healing.  Use Djinn liberally. Once you have a large enough pool of them, you can fight with them almost exclusively. Be sure to take advantage of summoning and use summons multiple times in the same fight if you can, since using a summon of one type will boost the power of the next one used of that same type by the same character.  EDIT: Do note that this is only if you give the characters the djinn type they're aligned to. You can mix and match to change their roles and stats."
GoldenSun,2kvdh2,ffgamefan,5,Fri Oct 31 21:20:32 2014 UTC,"Dude, that is ridiculously helpful, thanks ^_^"
GoldenSun,2kvdh2,kurosaur,1 point,Fri Oct 31 21:28:20 2014 UTC,There is one spell you can cast on yourself on the map that stops monsters from attacking you for a while. Similar to 'repel'(?) In Pokemon. Unfortunately I forgot the name but maybe someone else remembers it.
GoldenSun,2kncz3,jumpkid32,13,Wed Oct 29 05:09:11 2014 UTC,"Nope.  They need to finish 4, and they need to make it not-shit. They actually introduced some very interesting concepts in Dark Dawn (Light/Dark adepts, serious treatment of death, revisitation of old areas, Psynergy vortexs, new cultures, an active geo-political sphere) that they simply need to enflesh and give backstory.  Golden Sun and TLA were the results of a long (by industry standards at the time) development process. I would expect a similar development time if Camelot ever hopes of making GS4.  Right now, just hope Isaac is DLC for Smash Bros to drive hype for GS4. If that opportunity passes, this series is dead."
GoldenSun,2kncz3,radios_appear,1 point,Wed Oct 29 05:51:49 2014 UTC,"Well, I do think they should finish off Dark Dawn kinda ended on a cliff hanger there. Yeah I was disappointed with it, tbh the whole point of the game was to get a feather! seriously lmao...i really expected more, but as you get in it's not too bad! didn't like the addition of all those ancient races was annoying especially Sveta, I was just so annoyed!  I'd actually like to see what happened to Felix, he is my favourite character, hope he got with Sheba. Don't know how either Garet or Ivan reproduced! unlucky women XD"

GoldenSun,2kmugs,_Falgor_,3,Wed Oct 29 23:18:07 2014 UTC,"Just an idea: Use the wood of the trees of the region.  For example, near Imil, the trees are pines, so you could use pine wood? It would make sense and it gives you the opportunity to use different types of wood."

GoldenSun,2jziey,revyb,8,Wed Oct 22 20:54:23 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I don't think they should have made Dark Dawn. After TLA the story was over. DD is totally unrelated. Also, it just doesn't have the same feel as the first two."
GoldenSun,2jziey,walkeritout,3,Wed Oct 22 16:46:30 2014 UTC,"I believe they chose a fresh story because Camelot mainly wanted to target a new audience.  Also, making a sequel is much easier than creating a new IP.  Just having the name ""Golden Sun"" roped all the old fans in, while Camelot tried to rake in more people.  Seeing the sales, I'm sure they realized Golden Sun will stay predominantly a niche fan base.  Their business venture with Dark Dawn was a complete flop.  The game didn't haul in new people and it left the current fan base much more to be desired.  The current status at Camelot is probably focusing on titles that will surely make a profit, or finish what they started, but ultimately lose money.  That is, if they even have Golden Sun in their sights anymore."

In the other hand, I never found saturos and menardi evil, I would definitely like seeing that part of the story unfold. Alex can take part, as a deceiver of sorts...

GoldenSun,2ip0vk,Nero29gt,1 point,Thu Oct 9 13:17:36 2014 UTC,Whats that red dot East and a tad South of Tundaria Tower?
GoldenSun,2ip0vk,ffgamefan,2,Wed Oct 22 18:52:01 2014 UTC,"Not positive, but perhaps shallow water with treasure in it if my memory is right. There is also one East of Treasure Isle, South-East of Lemuria, North of SW Attaka and North of Shaman Village"
GoldenSun,2ip0vk,Nero29gt,2,Wed Oct 22 20:04:14 2014 UTC,"Isn't it ""shown"" in the in game map?"
GoldenSun,2ip0vk,MrSnackage,5,Thu Oct 9 07:25:32 2014 UTC,No it's not because it's hidden in the fog
GoldenSun,2ip0vk,Floowey,1 point,Thu Oct 9 09:00:09 2014 UTC,"Yup, it's in the fog. I want to know where exactly though, argh."
GoldenSun,2ip0vk,MrSnackage,0,Thu Oct 9 10:33:39 2014 UTC,"That's what I meant by ""shown""."
GoldenSun,2imawj,SeanOgMiSPARTAN,3,Wed Oct 8 01:42:52 2014 UTC,"You did good isolating Vale. And the size of the map made me think that damn, Warriors of Vale must have had legs of steel at the end of their quest !  I don't know if there's a way to make the pathways less uniform using different types of blocks while still keeping them good-looking. Maybe using sand, coarse dirt...? But my best guess would be stained clay."
GoldenSun,2imawj,_Falgor_,5,Wed Oct 8 02:11:47 2014 UTC,"they really shoud've had horses come to think of it.  Sadly stained clay has yet to be added to the xbox version, dirt would be (infected) by the blocks around it like grass or mycelium and while sand may look ok - being affected by gravity means it takes alot longer to lay it. I'll keep playing around with the idea of weathering the path in places and may come back to using sand if it continues to look too uniform. Cheers for the feedback"
GoldenSun,2imawj,_Falgor_,2,Wed Oct 8 02:19:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah right, it was logical since they used horses to pull caravans. I wonder why they didn't... Lack of time maybe ?  Hey at least now that Microsoft own Minecraft, maybe you're going to have more updates to catch up the PC version ?  Cheers for your awesome work !"
GoldenSun,2imawj,myactualnameisloris,4,Wed Oct 8 02:47:16 2014 UTC,"Great shit man. I'm the guy from twitch last week, nice to see consistent updates.   Star room looked great and the incremental elevations on the world map is a clever touch. Keep up the good work."
GoldenSun,2imawj,humanarnold,3,Thu Oct 9 01:04:18 2014 UTC,Cheers dude - il make an update every monday if i can / tuesday at latest to keep everyone informed and if any improvements can be made its easier to go back to something i was building yesterday rather than a month ago so weekly updates will keep coming
GoldenSun,2imawj,Hyro22,1 point,Thu Oct 9 02:08:09 2014 UTC,"Only just struck me on the part 4 video - you're really planning on making the entirety of Weyard, aren't you? I can't quite get my head around how big of a project this will end up being, especially if you're going to be as much of a perfectionist throughout. Great stuff so far, really enjoying seeing it unfold. And looking forward to you taking on some of the big structures, like the lighthouses & the Tret Tree"
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,Brodellsky,8,Sat Oct 4 03:21:42 2014 UTC,This won't change a thing but I actually protest by not buying the game until we get Isaac in DLC.
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,_Falgor_,9,Sat Oct 4 03:57:34 2014 UTC,You have stronger willpower than I.
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,_Falgor_,2,Sat Oct 4 04:32:45 2014 UTC,Very few people can know what it is to have only ONE character on his wishlist and he's not there... That explains why I won't buy this game.
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,UncleMilo,7,Sat Oct 4 19:36:49 2014 UTC,I feel like we're up there with the Ridley and K. Rool guys - jilted for two games now. It hurts.
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,nemec,7,Sat Oct 4 16:02:58 2014 UTC,Except for the fact that there is no other character representation for the GS franchise in Smash...
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,xxHikari,4,Sun Oct 5 01:10:02 2014 UTC,Man I've wanted him in forever.
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,InfernalDante,3,Sat Oct 4 15:54:47 2014 UTC,"We still don't know 100% that Isaac won't be in the game.  I have a feeling (as do other people) that we will get DLC or extra characters at some point, whether in the 3DS version, Wii U version, or both.  The fact that there are 4 unused character spots (the bottom two rows are out of line, if you line them up then there's enough room for 4 more characters).  The main rumor for the 4 DLC characters doesn't include Isaac, but I'm not giving up hope.  I was a little discouraged when we got Robin though, as he plays a lot like how I expected Isaac to play."
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,_Falgor_,3,Sun Oct 5 02:01:05 2014 UTC,I really hope you're right. That total absence of Golden Sun in the 3DS version is like a middle finger directly to us Golden Sun fans. It's heart-breaking.
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,UncleMilo,2,Sun Oct 5 02:10:35 2014 UTC,"Are there not even any trophies?  Sigh I was really hoping there was at least an Isaac trophy like in Brawl.  For shame, Sakurai.  For shame."
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,InfernalDante,2,Sun Oct 5 06:10:05 2014 UTC,"Robin is worrisome, but I remember back when they were developing Brawl they did a poll of Japanese Smash fans for who they wanted to see in the next game. Isaac was in the top 10 I believe - and at least half of the others have since made it into either Brawl or 4. I still hold onto that for hope."
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,_Falgor_,2,Sun Oct 5 03:09:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like you always see Isaac on the ""Most wanted Smash character"" list.  The only other character that I think has as many people hopeful would be Ridley, but all I want is Isaac.  If he were in the game, I still can't figure out what I would want his moves to be.  Would every move be some form of psyenergy, then his final smash be one of the summons?"
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,bubby963,2,Sun Oct 5 14:57:38 2014 UTC,"Actually the most asked are Ridley, King K.Rool and of course Mewtwo. In those three, the japanese don't really give a damn about Ridley. Sakurai said some things about Ridley and Mewtwo, didn't talk about K.Rool.  Isaac is a strange case. Technically there's really nothing against him: Still relevant with Dark Dawn, he is one of the really few characters who could have like a hundred original movesets and playstyles (not even overestimating), so he could even have twice as much custom moves as Palutena. He is still popular and is always present and in a good position in popularity polls, and he represents a series that never had a playable character.  The only thing I can see against him is that they're not sure if a Golden Sun 4 will ever happen."
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,_Falgor_,3,Sun Oct 5 18:20:21 2014 UTC,I want more than an assist trophy dangit! I can't understand how Lucas and Ness from the mother series are in there (granted they are brilliant games) but Golden Sun isn't. This is especially considering that Mother 3 - the game with Lucas in - was never even released outside of Japan.
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,bubby963,3,Sat Oct 4 19:18:35 2014 UTC,"/!\ Spoiler /!\ To be fair, Lucas isn't in Smash anymore."
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,_Falgor_,1 point,Sat Oct 4 19:37:44 2014 UTC,Didn't know that! Was in it for a long time though. It's just weird that characters from games like that got in but Golden Sun - which was quite popular - didn't.
GoldenSun,2i8yuy,CropUpAnywhere,3,Sat Oct 4 19:50:27 2014 UTC,"I think that they tried to include characters for the Japanese audience and some for the occidental audience. Ness and Lucas were probably aimed to please the japanese mainly.  Bad luck for Golden Sun fans, it's Little Mac that catched the promotion for the occidental side. We can say the same thing about Ridley, Japan really don't give a damn about Metroid."
GoldenSun,2howwm,SeanOgMiSPARTAN,6,Sun Sep 28 12:06:18 2014 UTC,A project iv'e started in an attempt to recreate the world of Weyard - Updates are released every Monday. Two updates already available. Would appreciate peoples opinions and ideas on how to proceed with the map etc. Cheers
GoldenSun,2howwm,BloodChicken,3,Sun Sep 28 12:11:30 2014 UTC,"Gonna dive right in after watching the first video:  Firstly, the music was a bit loud and I had trouble hearing you initially. Definitely want to make that more background music if you keep using it because it interfered with your narration.  On that note, I loved the narration! Apart from having a kickass accent it was clear and understandable (which is a big plus considering... a lot of the other youtubers out there) I loved how succinct you were on all your points and you had a lot of similar mindsets to how I would approach making a golden sun themed place so I loved your explanations for why you used certain things and why you didn't.  I have subscribed, encourage others to (because it was awesome) and I'm excited to see how far you take this!"
GoldenSun,2howwm,Bane43,2,Sun Sep 28 13:18:23 2014 UTC,Cheers for the feedback BloodChicken - i really appreciate it. Will continue to improve on the videos as much as i can. Have to admit i'm surprised anyone could understand the accent - We Irish can be a little too fast-paced in our speech but taking that into consideration i will continue saying 'bootan' as much as possible. Will post the next update at some stage tommorow. Savvy
GoldenSun,2howwm,Bane43,2,Sun Sep 28 17:29:03 2014 UTC,Episode 3 won't play
GoldenSun,2howwm,_Falgor_,2,Tue Sep 30 12:24:05 2014 UTC,processing at the moment should be ready in 5 minutes
GoldenSun,2howwm,BloodChicken,1 point,Tue Sep 30 14:04:57 2014 UTC,Just checked it out and I have to say that I'm really impressed with both your ambition and your patience for taking on what must be a really time consuming task. It's obviously a labor of love for you.  Couple of issues though: 1) It's a bit dark. I could not see the red stone circuitry that you used for the portal as you have no torches in there. Also a bit hard to see things at nighttime. 2) Pause the recording when your waiting for the world to render or to fast forward to daytime. 3) You need to put more buttons in the map so we can hear you say 'bootan' some more.   IMO of course
GoldenSun,2howwm,_Falgor_,1 point,Tue Sep 30 18:17:23 2014 UTC,"Thanks dude or dudette as the case may be. Will take all you've said into consideration to improve the videos. As for the redstone circuitry - my mate kevin will be posting guides on how to make the more complicated systems and i will link them when they're finished, Cheers for the feedback and i'll do my best to add more 'bootans'"
GoldenSun,2howwm,humanarnold,1 point,Tue Sep 30 18:39:12 2014 UTC,"I'm really looking forward to see the Elemental Stars Chamber, your work is amazing.  Thank you very much to give Weyard the love it deserves."
GoldenSun,2howwm,humanarnold,1 point,Wed Oct 1 03:34:02 2014 UTC,Second Video:  Music was much better volume-wise! And also the world looks great... I think you have a good sense of how to mitigate the limitations that minecraft provides (i.e using Quartz pillars instead of statues)  I love the button puzzle for Sol Sanctum. Honestly don't have any idea on anything to improve or change so... keep doing what you're doing!  I'll keep watching as long as you keep saying 'bootan' :)
GoldenSun,2gx1rz,banana_slap,4,Sat Sep 20 02:13:54 2014 UTC,"I found this guide helpful for RNG in TLA. It isn't the full explanation, but it does give enough info to get what you want: RNG.  It also has a nice little list of items that are good to get. The other poster has way better thorough links, but I found this one handy, too. :)"
GoldenSun,2gx1rz,totheworms,2,Sat Sep 20 05:35:43 2014 UTC,"Awesome, thanks."

GoldenSun,2gr7l4,Miva26,4,Thu Sep 18 12:27:52 2014 UTC,We've completed our first game of Weyard style risk. And the second season is open. There are only 4 slots left so sign up and join in asap.
GoldenSun,2gmicb,SkyberrySymphony,3,Wed Sep 17 02:56:25 2014 UTC,I like your Page One piece the best.  What DAW did you use?
GoldenSun,2gmicb,synapsii,3,Wed Sep 17 05:19:39 2014 UTC,Thank you! I used FL Studio for sequencing and Audacity for recording and mixing :)
GoldenSun,2gmicb,Teollisuus,3,Wed Sep 17 15:13:43 2014 UTC,"INSANE! I've been a huge fan of Golden Sun since it came out, and these are so, so good. Don't be discouraged - keep it going!!! You're making Golden Sun fans proud. =)"
GoldenSun,2gmicb,MinkoAk,2,Wed Sep 17 22:54:36 2014 UTC,"Wow, keep them coming !"
GoldenSun,2gmicb,AngelOfSol,2,Wed Sep 17 12:08:16 2014 UTC,This is amazing.

GoldenSun,2gfj1h,banana_slap,23,Mon Sep 15 04:27:36 2014 UTC,"I did once a while back, he keeps on asking and asking similar questions ,   until finally the volcano erupts and you die and game over"
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,TeaLiger,9,Mon Sep 15 04:53:38 2014 UTC,Glad I wasn't the only one.
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,MingusDew691,15,Mon Sep 15 04:55:12 2014 UTC,Fastest way to beat the game.
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,MingusDew691,3,Mon Sep 15 05:15:32 2014 UTC,In a sense yes. But then you'd get to miss out on the fun of having to go through multiple places multiple times to get everything.
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,rmphys,5,Mon Sep 15 05:18:27 2014 UTC,There's so much fun to be missed! Easily my favorite RPG series.
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,MinkoAk,1 point,Mon Sep 15 06:11:43 2014 UTC,I love and hate this game for the sole purpose of everything being hidden.
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,TravlerBlue,3,Mon Sep 15 06:15:22 2014 UTC,"Finish, but not beat."
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,TravlerBlue,7,Tue Sep 16 00:45:49 2014 UTC,You can pick yes ? TIL...
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,Eliwood_of_Pherae,8,Mon Sep 15 12:07:37 2014 UTC,"I did once, just to see what would happen. It's the only actual game over you can get and then it basically says, ""Now go back and pick the right choice, or don't play anymore."""
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,TravlerBlue,2,Mon Sep 15 07:44:40 2014 UTC,Probably one of my favorite parts of the game. Guilt tripping you into saving the world after dooming it.
GoldenSun,2gfj1h,Arrlan,2,Mon Sep 15 07:53:55 2014 UTC,"Yea, it's cool, but at the same time: it doesn't actually let you make the full choice. I think it would've been better if they had you go back to the Start Screen and completely restart (if you didn't save) or send you back to the last save point."
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,LegendofDragoon,13,Fri Sep 12 01:54:15 2014 UTC,I blame Dark Dawn.
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,synapsii,6,Fri Sep 12 06:56:02 2014 UTC,Never give up hope. Maybe he'll be in DLC.
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,jacoblovejordan,2,Fri Sep 12 15:29:11 2014 UTC,Hmm they're saying that the Wii U version will unlock a couple more characters... who knows
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,MikeCam,1 point,Fri Sep 12 11:29:26 2014 UTC,"No, both the 3ds and Wiiu versions have the same characters."
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,Demonfire94,2,Sat Sep 13 18:13:45 2014 UTC,"He's saying that connecting a 3ds to a WiiU version might unlock some characters for both, not only for the WiiU."
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,subpubescenthair,2,Wed Sep 17 07:39:41 2014 UTC,I was still hoping.
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,Eliwood_of_Pherae,2,Fri Sep 12 12:39:09 2014 UTC,"The fire emblem character Robin uses spell tomes, it's close but it just isn't right. Just like the red bird skin for duck hunt being close to Banjo-Kazooie."
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,CropUpAnywhere,1 point,Fri Sep 12 21:40:45 2014 UTC,I was actually thinking Isaac would make a nice robin clone  Spire for Elwind Ragnarok for Arcfire Force or Earthquake for Thunder/Elthunder/Arcthunder/Thoron Growth for Nosferatu
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,bakodude,1 point,Fri Sep 12 21:44:16 2014 UTC,Can he have sol blade and his final be Megiddo:)
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,EnderOS,4,Mon Sep 15 23:35:31 2014 UTC,"I always wondered. If Isaac was in SSB, would his final smash be Meggido, Odyssey, or Iris?"
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,bakodude,2,Sat Sep 27 19:35:02 2014 UTC,This became a tough decision
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,Brodellsky,1 point,Sat Sep 27 22:44:15 2014 UTC,Why is Camelot referenced in the credits?
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,Arrlan,3,Fri Sep 12 02:52:10 2014 UTC,Nobody knows. Could be for Waluigi AT
GoldenSun,2g5uoe,Ferdi265,1 point,Fri Sep 12 02:55:59 2014 UTC,Sad thing is Isaac would be such a good SSB character. Sword Fighter like Roy or Marth just with Earth psyenergy moves. His epic move could be a summon or somthing.
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Nikuya,10,Wed Sep 3 08:49:16 2014 UTC,Probably the ply statue like you. I had the same issue but resolved it rather quickly. They really leave you in the dark there
GoldenSun,2fcal8,xxHikari,11,Wed Sep 3 15:18:41 2014 UTC,There is a cut scene where Mia uses Ply on the entrance as a hint.
GoldenSun,2fcal8,NetTrap,7,Wed Sep 3 16:34:57 2014 UTC,The first game; The start of the game is very slow. It takes a lot of time before you can actually leave Vale.
GoldenSun,2fcal8,JetTractor,7,Wed Sep 3 15:49:29 2014 UTC,"Golden Sun was one of the first games I'd ever played, so when I couldn't get out of Vale I was really confused. I thought that Nut hanging on a tree was a Mars Djinni and the GBA just had shitty graphics."
GoldenSun,2fcal8,The_Whole_World,7,Fri Sep 5 01:30:55 2014 UTC,The 'point of no return' in DD. Ugh
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Derp1121,4,Thu Sep 4 04:58:01 2014 UTC,That conversation in lemuria. Takes like 10 minutes
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Niquey,4,Wed Sep 3 20:51:10 2014 UTC,I would say mapping out the random repeating rooms in that cave on the way to that one dragon. I didn't have fun drawing it out and the while thing was really tedious.
GoldenSun,2fcal8,dahakaDAHK,2,Wed Sep 3 12:05:29 2014 UTC,I already had pen and paper ready when I discovered there was an easier way using the plants...
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Niquey,1 point,Wed Sep 3 15:22:09 2014 UTC,What's the easier way? I've replayed it three times since and always used a guide since then.
GoldenSun,2fcal8,aPoliteCanadian,3,Wed Sep 3 16:04:05 2014 UTC,"You talking about those rooms with the plants in the middle?  Use growth on them and they turn into an arrow showing the right direction to go.  May you have to use reveal as well?  I can't remember exactly, it's been a while, but I remember growth making arrows."
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Niquey,8,Wed Sep 3 16:57:09 2014 UTC,Oh. My. God.
GoldenSun,2fcal8,humanarnold,1 point,Wed Sep 3 18:35:52 2014 UTC,"Yeah, you just trade a Venus and a Mars Djinn between Isaac and Garet :)"
GoldenSun,2fcal8,AverNL,1 point,Wed Sep 3 19:10:05 2014 UTC,"Just growth. Points the way. Makes getting to the serpent really easy, but if you haven't done all the Dancing Doll and mirror stuff beforehand, they fight is nearly impossible to win."
GoldenSun,2fcal8,aPoliteCanadian,4,Sat Sep 6 15:31:32 2014 UTC,Finding out how to get past those flows to reach Poseidon & Lemuria. Took me ages XD
GoldenSun,2fcal8,AverNL,2,Wed Sep 3 15:19:51 2014 UTC,"Oh yea, I discovered it completely by chance, though there are the children in that one village that sing you the way through, but its annoying the first time :D"
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Fuminplatypus,2,Wed Sep 3 15:37:42 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I made the connection between the kids and the sea of time pretty quick, but for some reason tried to memorize the sequence.  After a while I realized that pen and paper existed :/  it was kind of annoying that that sequence played on auto though so I had to watch it a couple of times to write it all down."
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Coostabo,2,Wed Sep 3 16:59:50 2014 UTC,"I had discovered it by coincidence too! Was at the flows, had no idea how to pass them, so out of boredom, I started sailing circles around the volcano-thing... when the flows disappeared, I was so relieved XD"
GoldenSun,2fcal8,gamefanatic,2,Wed Sep 3 17:17:52 2014 UTC,"I was just thinking about this the other day. The amount of detail and discovering available in Golden Sun was just amazing.  ""Can't get through the Sea of Time?"" ""Oh, well there is a children's song off on an island somewhere with tree stumps, and if you watch the kids it'll show you how to pass."" Too good."
GoldenSun,2fcal8,hypersoda,3,Tue Sep 23 16:12:23 2014 UTC,The hour-long tutorial with Isaac and Garet in Dark Dawn is the reason why I get put off whenever I try to replay that game again.  Oh yeah and the ply statue as well.
GoldenSun,2fcal8,AndrewPH,3,Sat Sep 6 10:20:17 2014 UTC,"Definitely the the numerous points of no return in Golden Sun DD. As a completionist, whenever I realised I'd missed a Djinn or Summon, I instantly restarted my game entirely. Had to do this about 4 times before i finished the game proper."
GoldenSun,2fcal8,MotherlyBear,3,Sun Sep 7 19:51:52 2014 UTC,"Reading out a gold password to my best friend.  Over the phone.  Also, in Gaia Rock (I believe) Ankohl Ruins there's this one spot where you fall down, only to land directly in front of a door.

GoldenSun,2fcal8,kaeleymel,1 point,Sat Sep 6 15:28:54 2014 UTC,"I am currently replaying GS and in the Mogall forest, it reminded me of my first play through of GS I for some odd reason did not think to equip Force. I spent hours of trail and error doing down random paths until I found my way out.  Second play through I equipped Force and was like 'Why did I not do this the first time? It is so much easier to navigate now that I am using force!'"
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Arrlan,1 point,Sat Sep 6 15:28:44 2014 UTC,"I did exactly the same thing. You can actually skip getting Force, so I just went ahead exploring and completely forgot about the trials you take for the Force crystal :P"
GoldenSun,2fcal8,Kyhron,1 point,Wed Sep 3 12:25:21 2014 UTC,That reminds me during my first play though that due to not figuring out that I could use 'move' to get through the Kolima barricade that I ended up going to Imil first and doing the Mercury Lighthouse. I tried several times to defeat Saturos but failed due to being under leveled so I spent a few hours grinding to get my level up and finally beat Saturos.  I realized on my next play through I was suppose to go to Kolima Forest then Imil and then back to Kolima Forest and I wouldn't have to grind. The benefit of doing Imil first is that you can do Kolima Forest in one hit so it wasn't too bad.  First play through as well I never noticed I had catch beads so I never equipped them haha.
GoldenSun,2fcal8,MinkoAk,1 point,Wed Sep 3 15:36:41 2014 UTC,"Haha, I also went to Imil first, but as I was stuck on the Ply statue I had loads of time to level up, got to Saturos being way more powerful than I should have been, and then destroyed Trent :P"
GoldenSun,2fcal8,XxLTxX,1 point,Thu Sep 4 09:51:23 2014 UTC,From memory I ended up over grinding to level 15 or 20 and easily defeating Saturos and very easily defeating Tret.

GoldenSun,2f2292,humanarnold,6,Sun Aug 31 03:18:41 2014 UTC,Skies of Arcadia: Legends and The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky
GoldenSun,2f2292,Dracobolt,2,Sun Aug 31 04:53:05 2014 UTC,"I've heard of Skies of Arcadia before, it's a PC game, right? I'll add it to the list to check out, I think I remember an AVGN episode raving about it."
GoldenSun,2f2292,Dracobolt,2,Fri Sep 5 13:14:07 2014 UTC,"It was Dreamcast, and they did a port to Gamecube with additional content. The graphics are a bit dated, and the encounter rate is crazy high, but it's really worth looking into."
GoldenSun,2f2292,HSBLESSPLZ,2,Fri Sep 5 14:03:09 2014 UTC,Skies of Arcadia is one of the best games I've ever played.
GoldenSun,2f2292,BlizzardFenrir,6,Sat Dec 13 00:23:46 2014 UTC,Secret of Mana A.k.a Seiken Densetsu 3
GoldenSun,2f2292,HSBLESSPLZ,4,Sun Aug 31 05:08:39 2014 UTC,"Secret of Mana is Seiken Densetsu 2. Seiken Densetsu 3 is a different game that was never released in the west, but has an unofficial translation patch.  Both are equally amazing games.  SD3 in particular is cool because you pick 3 characters out of 6 at the start, and all three of those characters' stories are woven together to create the main storyline. You get to see different parts of the world, and fight different final bosses, depending on which characters you picked."
GoldenSun,2f2292,OurManlyPeace,3,Sun Aug 31 10:59:54 2014 UTC,Thanks. I sorta got confused as to which one it was. i'm definitely talking about SD3 where the stories interweave. I remember now that i played an English Patched Version as it was never released outside of Japan.
GoldenSun,2f2292,xxHikari,5,Sun Aug 31 11:39:53 2014 UTC,"If you are open to trying final fantasy games, I would hiiiighly recommend final fantasy tactics advanced, its for GBA, I've sunk a couple hundred hours into various playthroughs of that game. If you enjoy RPGs you should absolutely love that game."
GoldenSun,2f2292,BlizzardFenrir,4,Sun Aug 31 13:17:55 2014 UTC,Most Tales of games are excellent.
GoldenSun,2f2292,xxHikari,3,Sun Aug 31 09:22:18 2014 UTC,"The main composer for the Tales Of series, Motoi Sakuraba, also composed the Golden Sun soundtrack, so that's another plus!  Tales of Phantasia is the first game in the series, and it's great but hasn't aged all that well. The best version by far is the PS1 rerelease, which is a bit more modern. It's only in Japanese, but there's multiple translation patches available. I prefer the Phantasian Productions translation because it also updates a few gameplay things (such as give you a ring that gives you more control freedom in battle right at the start, instead of having to find it halfway through the game)."
GoldenSun,2f2292,ProperlyBasic,3,Sun Aug 31 11:07:40 2014 UTC,He also does Star Ocean music right? And no problem because I can speak Japanese!
GoldenSun,2f2292,ProperlyBasic,3,Mon Sep 1 03:50:16 2014 UTC,"I recommend final fantasy 4 and 6 (2 and 3 by US numbering). They are by Square, who also did Chrono Trrigger, but they have a different feel. They are my favorites of the series and are probably your best bet of being the most like Golden Sun. The FF4 remake for the DS is excellent. If you want strategy, I loved Tactics Ogre: Knight of Lodis for the GBA; final fantasy tactics advance was fun for me, but didn't hit the level of Tactics Ogre or Golden Sun.  In terms of newer games, Fire Emblem awakening is great (strategy based game), Dust an Elysian Tale is a good game, though not an RPG in the same sense as Golden Sun. Zelda is always great. I loved Skyward Sword, have grown to love Twilight Princess, Ocarina of Time is a classic, and A Link Between Worlds is good too. Windwaker HD is also good.  I've not played, but have heard good things about Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, which is now on Steam."
GoldenSun,2f2292,Archer0000,1 point,Sun Aug 31 22:38:37 2014 UTC,"Are there any continuity issues that would come from starting off with FF4? I was just thinking it would be easiest for me, as I have a DS.    I've not played Fire Emblem, but I have played games that are supposed to be Fire Emblem clones, like Lord of the Ring: THe Third Age for GBA, and enjoyed that. I also like Advance Wars a lot, which I've heard is also similar in principle to Fire Emblem."
GoldenSun,2f2292,RaptorMeezus,2,Fri Sep 5 13:19:01 2014 UTC,"The final fantasies aren't true sequels of each other. So you can start with any of them without having played prior ones (games like X-2 being the exception).  Fire emblem is a lot like advance wars with a top down strategy, certain weapons that are stronger against others, etc."
GoldenSun,2f2292,Espurr_therapist,2,Sun Sep 7 20:14:05 2014 UTC,"Each game is set in their own universe the roman numerals defining each universe as it's own only ones with sequels/spinoffs/prequels were 7, 10 and 13."
GoldenSun,2f2292,calebhall,3,Mon Jan 12 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"The Golden Sun series is tied for first(collectively) in my top three RPGs list, the other one being Final Fantasy 6(3). The other two are Chrono Trigger and probably Final Fantasy 4(2). I'm kinda bummed you don't like Chrono Trigger, as it really is an amazing game. And if you're playing it on DS, there are ways to make it even easier to navigate the menus and change the way battles flow so it fits you better, but whatever, that's not what this is about. It's so hard to come up with games that are similar to GS because there really just aren't that many. However, I do have a couple of games that might float your boat. I've recently started playing Terranigma, and it's pretty fun so far. There's also Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsue 3, as has been mentioned already. There's also the Lufia series, Breath of Fire, there's also a translated version of Final Fantasy 5 you can play on an SNES emulator, and that one is really good. You could also play The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, if you haven't already played that, since that is arguably one of the best in the series. Man, there are just so many good RPGs out there, but still, Golden Sun is so friggin' amazing, I really wish they would make a fourth one already."
GoldenSun,2f2292,Brodellsky,2,Wed Sep 17 10:03:02 2014 UTC,"Tales of Symphonia for GC/PS2 might be a good choice. It has a really deep story and it has a good amount of talking; other good choices would be FFVI or FFIV for SNES.  Chrono Trigger is a retro game now; it can have it's flaws comparing it to more modern games. But it was a gem at it's time. I hope you give it a second chance later, I didn't like Earthbound the first three times I played it, but once I played it through I loved it"
GoldenSun,2f2292,Himrik,1 point,Sun Aug 31 04:29:26 2014 UTC,"Thanks for this. I'll need to look at an emulator, as I don't have access to these consoles right now.    I've sunk about 10 hours of gameplay into CT now, so I think I'll see it through. But unfortunately, it's not been enjoyable for me so far. Maybe I'm not the right audience for it, though I thought I would be. It feels like I get the things in the game/moments in the plot that are supposed to be impressive and to make an impact on you, but the actual experience just doesn't feel right."
GoldenSun,2f2292,Robot_Legs,2,Fri Sep 5 13:16:54 2014 UTC,I loved shining force on the sega genesis. There are many to that series that you can get on an emulator or on steam
GoldenSun,2f2292,kaizenkaos,2,Sun Aug 31 05:33:21 2014 UTC,"Not quite the same, but maybe Dark Souls?  Same composer for that game as GS, and Sakaruba also did the Tales of series, which may be worth checking out."
GoldenSun,2ewufw,plzdontgivemeherpes,6,Fri Aug 29 12:12:55 2014 UTC,"Did this not long ago. It should only take a couple of seconds when done right. I thought mine had stalled too, turns out that really getting the connection jammed in is very important. If the wire is a little bit lose, or of the connector isn't in all the way, it won't work.    I don't mind using the code, but if I remember right, there are some story elements that only carry over if you use the cable, so I've always preferred it."
GoldenSun,2ewufw,humanarnold,4,Fri Aug 29 12:21:21 2014 UTC,As long as you pick the big code you get all of the story side quests opened up.
GoldenSun,2ewufw,MasterRiven,2,Fri Aug 29 17:32:23 2014 UTC,"While this is true, that huge code with letters that can easily be confused are annoying to type in.  That being said, I love doing it to transfer hacked inventories."
GoldenSun,2ewufw,Chronotakular,1 point,Fri Aug 29 18:19:46 2014 UTC,"Thanks, didn't know that. Transfer cable is the way to go though. I'm lucky enough to have 2 GBAs. Bout an original one when it first came out, but that thing is an abomination due to the lack of a backlit screen. Picked up an SP many years later for change on ebay, thankfully the cable works between the two different gameboys"
GoldenSun,2ewufw,humanarnold,2,Sun Aug 31 02:59:08 2014 UTC,"Every code transfers all story elements, but the cable transfers your characters with their equipment equipped and all the Djinn set in the way you set them in the first Game instead of randomly.  With the codes Isaac and Ivan fight Karst & Agatio weaponless, makes for a ""funny"" fight.  Edit : At least, every code transfers all story elements is based on the wiki."

GoldenSun,2ea2bf,ProperlyBasic,5,Fri Aug 22 15:04:00 2014 UTC,"I finished my Wii u playthrough and am waiting for TLA to be released there.

GoldenSun,2eaiyx,ProperlyBasic,4,Fri Aug 22 17:01:03 2014 UTC,"I have the GS/TLA any% records (3h24m/5h53m both real time) as well as the second best time in GS 100%. Most people run the games allowing save and quit which allows both games to be heavily based around RNG manipulation. If you're serious about competing for records for the S&Q categories then starting with GS to get a feel for the RNG manipulation is essential as TLA is significantly more complicated. To give you a feel for the power of RNG manipulation, the TLA speed run defeats the Serpent between level 19-21 without turning on any lights -- http://www.twitch.tv/tl_plexa/c/3013666  A less commonly run category are the no S&Q categories (or ""single segment""). This eliminates any RNG manipulation, but also significantly cuts down the number of skips and use of data-recall to sanctum warp places. With that said, this category plays out the game more as intended so clever team strategies, class choices and boss strategies need to be used. To give you an idea of the time difference between no S&Q and S&Q, GS1 any% with S&Q takes 3:24 to complete, without S&Q the record is about 5:1X.   So to answer your question, it depends on how you feel about RNG abuse :)"
GoldenSun,2eaiyx,TLPlexa,1 point,Fri Aug 22 18:21:14 2014 UTC,"Thanks, that is quite informative and helpful. I've done some of the manipulation for things like getting the K-sword. I'll have to check out your runs."
GoldenSun,2eaiyx,TLPlexa,1 point,Fri Aug 22 18:42:24 2014 UTC,"Yeah up until very recently (i.e. last year) the only kind of RNG manipulation known was for manipulating drops from enemies. Golden Sun (incl. TLA) have two random number seeds; which we call the battle random number and general random number. Manipulating drops is all about manipulating the battle random number. Generally speaking, the speedruns are more interested in manipulating the general random number which controls everything from NPC movement through to forging in TLA to whether or not you can run from a fight. We learned that using psynergy in the overworld and entering in attacks and then cancelling them (""attack cancelling"") manipulates the GRN, and when done right allows you to flee every battle without fail.   I've been heavily into running this series for over a year and there's still so much to be found with the games. It really is just a giant puzzle which we keep on developing faster solutions for. You may also be interested in Baal Nocturno's run of Golden Sun 100% at ESA which also includes killing Deadbeard (normally excluded in 100%) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvhrfc4_PBQ Baal has the third fastest time which is in the low 4:20's"
GoldenSun,2eaiyx,IsaacAccount,2,Fri Aug 22 19:07:20 2014 UTC,"I had a record in GS1 for a while.  I didn't lose any appreciation for the game because of it. But your milage may very. If you get frustrated, it may make you hate the game. You have to be very patient or emulating to enjoy speed running the GS series."
GoldenSun,2e8yci,TLPlexa,1 point,Fri Aug 22 04:14:32 2014 UTC,"Really late reply and probably not the most helpful but the reason VC games were running at 50HZ is because PAL games were uploaded to the Virtual Console, but PAL and NTSC GBA games both run at 60fps because unlike older TV's which have the different framerates that made older games running at 50Hz necessary back in the day, the GBA had it's own screen and therefore could run at 60Hz both sides of the Atlantic.  TLDR: 60Hz because there are no 50Hz versions of GBA games"

GoldenSun,2dfc42,humanarnold,3,Wed Aug 13 10:35:54 2014 UTC,IIRC monsters have 50% more hp on hard mode. No other difference.
GoldenSun,2dfc42,RivetSpawn,4,Wed Aug 13 12:51:50 2014 UTC,"Hard mode is purely just a challenge with no additional reward.  They will get + 25% attack and defense stats on top of the hp Xenolith mentioned.  Enemys spawning mid battle won't have increased stats, and finally a couple of mad bosses won't have quite that much of a stat boost due to them hitting the cap before it reaches 150% hp for example."

GoldenSun,2dbmv1,Mylaur,7,Tue Aug 12 10:06:24 2014 UTC,How did you find out about Golden Sun in 2014 and what made you want to play it?
GoldenSun,2dbmv1,Huegalo,13,Tue Aug 12 18:13:45 2014 UTC,I'm jealous that he gets to play through these games for the first time.
GoldenSun,2dbmv1,NetTrap,5,Tue Aug 12 20:53:53 2014 UTC,"On /r/smashbros, I have seen plenty of threads and posts talking about Isaac and Golden Sun, and how it is amazing and he deserves to be in the game.  I didn't know anything about Golden Sun.  One day someone posted a possible moveset of Isaac , where he was drawn. I thought he looked cool and original.  Then one day again, I saw another thread (on another forum) praising Golden Sun, and the op posted his favorite music from Golden Sun. Because I was curious, I clicked on the link and had a blast. Since I like games where music is excellent, I decided to give Golden Sun a shot even though I don't play much rpg.  Then I discovered it is a gba game and thought that I missed all the awesome gba games like Golden Sun, and I should play them all. At the moment I got Golden Sun and all of the Fire Emblem gba (that I have already finished).  That battle music is golden.  tl;dr : I discovered Golden Sun because of /r/smashbros and a music."
GoldenSun,2dbmv1,Marabio,2,Wed Aug 13 08:58:08 2014 UTC,"Congrats on finding this game. It's extremely philosophical and high brow. You're going to find a lot of dirty jokes and impressive dialog, especially in Golden Sun 2.   Golden sun the lost age gives you so many rewards for completing difficult-ish puzzles. It's amazing. By the time you finish the game and transfer all of your djinn, you'll feel greatly satisfied.   There are also a lot of zelda like elements in this game."
GoldenSun,2dbmv1,kurosaur,7,Wed Aug 13 14:13:40 2014 UTC,"Don't worry, where you're at in the game right now, you can still go back and collect Corona.  But there is a certain point where you can not go back to other points in the game, and having as many Djinni as possible when facing bosses, etc. is vital, because they raise your overall stats a lot.  If you remember how to get through all of the places you've been previous, it won't be too long of a trip back. If it were me, I'd go back and get it for sure!"
GoldenSun,2dbmv1,LucidicShadow,7,Tue Aug 12 10:23:53 2014 UTC,"The first two Golden Sun games only have temporary points of no return. Up until you engage in the final cutscene/boss sequence, you can still walk all the way from the Venus Lighthouse back to Vale if you forgot something.  Dark Dawn is another story, though. There are three points of no return in that game."
GoldenSun,2dbmv1,kurosaur,5,Wed Aug 13 00:12:13 2014 UTC,Dark dawn really annoyed me with that

GoldenSun,2d98qp,Floowey,1 point,Mon Aug 11 19:21:33 2014 UTC,"Sure: It's set on Weyard and the stories occur in place of the events of the original game. The longest running group are at Kolima and hope to stop the lighthouses from being lit. Another group is about to start in Sol Sanctum and will want to light them.  Those two groups are full, but we have two others about to begin: a group of Villains (we haven't decided what they want to do yet) and some Sailors who will start in Alhafra and explore the Eastern Seas. If you wanted to explore anywhere else then you can start a new group. It's a very open role-play, without many rules."
GoldenSun,2d98qp,The7thNomad,1 point,Mon Aug 11 19:31:44 2014 UTC,Is this like a tabletop RP? Or are you guys just telling stories to each other? (Nothing wrong with either)
GoldenSun,2d98qp,The7thNomad,1 point,Tue Aug 12 02:53:05 2014 UTC,"Just telling stories. We have another RP that is more like tabletop (though it's nothing to do with Golden sun), but it's full. We also run a few of tactical games some based on golden sun, some not. There is a list here: http://s7.zetaboards.com/GoldenSunrise/topic/9133105/1/"
GoldenSun,2d5oac,WerdsWerth,2,Sun Aug 10 16:50:48 2014 UTC,"Well, Dark Dawn had some flaws and there wasn't much of the fan base left after 10 years to boot, which means less people bought the game. They won't make a sequel for a game that there is no demand for.   On a personal note, I had some major quarrels with the game such as no backtracking allowed, and other problems with the dialogue and plot. Unfortunately the game did pretty much everything else right but then again, so did the original games and more.   It's a damn shame. I'm just waiting for a new Advance Wars to come out at this point, because the 4 Advance Wars games were all excellent and I think Interactive said they would make another."
GoldenSun,2d5oac,The_Whole_World,2,Mon Aug 11 04:46:53 2014 UTC,I purchased Dark Dawn. I even pre ordered it. The store I preordered it from didn't receive their copies for a week after launch. I must have been the only person who bought it.

GoldenSun,2c4127,batdrumman,1 point,Tue Aug 5 15:13:29 2014 UTC,It's hard? The doors are numbered. But I'm pretty sure the longest dungeon would be the one in dark Dawn. It's either in the treasure Island or the volcano? It's the dungeon with the maze that has like 50+ rooms that look similar. If you do it without a walkthrough you're going to spend a bunch of time trying to get all the items.
GoldenSun,2c4127,MrSnackage,1 point,Wed Jul 30 04:47:34 2014 UTC,"I don't know how hard it really is, but I DO know that Air's Rock is pretty massive. It is definitely one of the largest Dungeons in the game. And unlike most large dungeons (ex. The Lighthouses) it is both a single thematically unified area and brief of story segments, which certainly make it seem even larger."

GoldenSun,2avsfk,PhatBoiRL,1 point,Wed Jul 16 21:31:44 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't want to play Matthew as main character again, but your idea is something along the lines of my jumbled points in mind.  You play as Felix's kid, mirroring GS and TLA, and later in the game, Felix's kid & co. meets up with Matthew & co. as a plot device, and will exposition the shit out of the group and player.  Maybe most people won't like this idea, just because it mirrors the first two games too much, but it's just my own ideal.  Felix's kid would be traveling with Piers through the western side of Weyward, and he would be playable in the beginning, much like Issac and Garet were.  But then he would become gravely injured, making him unable to battle, so he would become the ""Krendan"" of the group.  I would also want more diversity in the party.  Maybe someone from Garoh, or even Prox.  For the next part, I apologize for any inconsistencies with the actual lore and story, because it's been years since I've played.  Perhaps the vortexes are a form of advance psynergy.  I forget the name of the city, but the one from TLA near the Jupiter lighthouse, that split off from Weyward and is floating up high.  They would be the ones planting these vortexes all over Weyward.  I think of the city as elitists or people who think they are above all species on Weyward.  Being away from the world has warped their culture and now they're playing Gods.  Seeing that Weyward is dying, they start planting these vortexes to prevent the suffering with a hastened world's end, a moral reversal from the lighting of the lighthouses.  And now, the introduction of dark psynergy and the eventual discovery of light.  From here on, it's free game.  Light and dark can be pure psynergy, or made via combinations with the existing elements.  The existence of light and dark djinn are also questionable.  This is my two cents.  At this point, it's all just fanfic.  Hopefully Camelot decides to make DD2.  Or more Mario sport games, since that's all they're doing right now."
GoldenSun,2avsfk,PhatBoiRL,1 point,Wed Jul 16 21:31:19 2014 UTC,"There is one vital flaw with this. If Felix's kid (assuming he got luck, he seemed like the lone wolf type) joined up with Matthew and his party, there would be 10-12 people. There would have to be an imbalance of djinn if Felix's kid, or Felix himself joined. No disrespect to you, but the whole mirror thing of the first two kinda struck me as kinda... Um... Yeah."

If I recall correctly, everyone except the initial three, Matthew, Tyrell, and Karis, have gone to do their own thing once the Dark Dawn arc finished.  So including Felix's kid, we just need four more characters, perhaps children from the other heroes.  Also, with the advent of dark psynergy, and possible light, we might be seeing new adapt elements and djinns.  Perhaps one more party member for light and dark as minimum, so we would be seeing 10-12, if this is a possibility.  Like you said, having more members creates balancing problems, but keep in mind that this will also make new possibilities, with more classes and psynergies.  This reminded me of one revelation I had while playing DD.  They showcased all the weapons and the strongest summons from TLA, so to stop the series from getting stale in DD2, they would have to create even stronger weapons, ridiculously awesome weapon unleashes, and more summons.  Even adding four 5 stock summons per element would be a nice addition. Finding out how they would one up the Sol Blade, Catastrophe, and Iris would be a sight to see.  They need to be creative and add more things.  Most people complained about DD being too easy, but I personally felt that the amount of staleness and ""keeping the series safe"" was the main down side.  Looks like a went on a random tangent and completely forgot about why I initially replied to your comment."

GoldenSun,29iok7,Ozwien,11,Mon Jun 30 23:57:37 2014 UTC,"Dark dawn is easily the worst of the three games and also the easiest by comparison. If you did enjoy some of the gameplay aspects such as the combat and puzzle solving it's essentially the same (the dungeons are better in the first two imo). As for linearity, TLA is pretty open, at one point there are 5 dungeons that you need to complete that you can do in almost any order.  The way I put it is that dark dawn is basically just trying to be the first two games but doesn't do it well."
GoldenSun,29iok7,Spewis,2,Tue Jul 1 00:14:35 2014 UTC,"The trident part! I always tried going to the ""more difficult"" one first but that ended up making the next ones way easier after you over level. Ahh who am I kidding, I over leveled the entire game in each new zone."
GoldenSun,29iok7,Arrlan,7,Mon Jul 14 22:37:17 2014 UTC,"Dark Dawn PALES in comparison to the original two, in both story complexity and quality of gameplay."

GoldenSun,29iok7,synapsii,6,Tue Jul 1 04:38:56 2014 UTC,"Just as pretty much anybody says here, dark dawn is the worst/easiest/most linear of the three games. The first two have a much better (and a much more finished) story (which you btw can look up in dark dawn). Also they have both no points of no return, there are sidequests and the characters are not half-heartedly forced into your party. Even if there is few characterization/character development, the characters are much better made than in dd. And during the long dialogues they do not react as much as in dark dawn.  First gs starts pretty slowly, so be patient when starting it. The second one is a bit faster and less linear, but the first one is still not as linear as the third one."
GoldenSun,29iok7,leon95,5,Tue Jul 1 07:35:23 2014 UTC,"The first two are my favorite games ever, countless hours poured into them with no regrets."
GoldenSun,29iok7,ExecutiveDave,4,Tue Jul 1 12:49:24 2014 UTC,"I find that I enjoy the first two a lot more. They're more challenging, and less linear - especially The Lost Age; much of that game doesn't really have a set order to it, and there are side-quests you can do. There's a lot of exploration involved, and for me that was fun. I think the combat is harder in those two, as well, although I'm not much of a number-cruncher so I can't give you statistics!"
GoldenSun,29iok7,OctopodesoftheSea,3,Tue Jul 1 00:24:27 2014 UTC,I recommend playing the first before the second. Seeing as the second takes off right after the first ended.
GoldenSun,29iok7,JennaIsMe,2,Tue Jul 1 18:44:55 2014 UTC,"Agreed. Just in case OP doesn't know, Golden Sun was originally being developed as one game for the Nintendo 64, but they split it into two games (Golden Sun and Golden Sun: The Lost Age) when development shifted to Game Boy Advance. The Lost Age is more than a sequel-- it's the entire second half of a game."

GoldenSun,29iok7,The_Whole_World,1 point,Tue Jul 1 21:34:45 2014 UTC,"I didnt dislike DD, it had a lot of unanswered questions however but I wouldnt say its the ""worst""  It reminded me of when I first played GS. It didnt WOW me until I played TLA and seeing the whole story play out. I would as far as saying i didnt appreciate GS until i played both of them back to back.  Which is how I think DD is.  Now, should they have made DD? No. There is a lot they could have done story wise before DD came into play and it was made worse with the pandering they added to it which made it easy and spawned a bunch of useless characters.  But overall you cant compare. GS and TLA is a complete story. DD isnt, its just like the initial GS (IMO) which always felt incomplete by itself."

GoldenSun,29iok7,chick_repellent,1 point,Sun Jul 13 18:23:56 2014 UTC,"Dark Dawn is pretty bad compared to the first one and horrible compared to The Lost Age. For starters, the first two in the series are much more connected and have a deeper plot.  Secondly, even though the psyenergy usage in the first two is more limited (distance wise), I feel like they're overall used more creatively in the puzzles. In general the first two have longer dungeons, a better storyline, better puzzles, and better bosses. Lastly, music. The music in Dark Dawn made me sick. GS and TLA had a soundtrack that I would  listen to outside of gameplay. DD had very few area specialized songs, and that hurt it for me :P purely opinion though."
GoldenSun,29iok7,magicalbiscuits,-4,Mon Jul 28 04:11:49 2014 UTC,"Why would you play Dark Dawn first!?  And more expensive?  Well that's true, assuming you don't know what an emulator is.

GoldenSun,2973mt,batdrumman,1 point,Wed Jul 2 13:30:26 2014 UTC,A good chunk of the old locations are actually on the map in inaccessible locations without using cheats of course.

GoldenSun,28sksv,muffinsformen,9,Sun Jun 22 14:08:04 2014 UTC,"I want them to pick up where DD left off, but I want them to feel free to make it its own game. The majority of my problems with DD have to do with the developers feeling the need to replicate things from the the original two just to replicate them instead of seeing what made those aspects of the first two games great. Like:     Emphasis on children and parents, and generally making characters reappear just to have the reappear, instead of being meaningfully connected to a strong narrative. Making crossbone isle reappear and be 10x easier. Forcing mechanics like the 8 character battle system from TLA, but in the context of one game it meant that only 5 of those characters were meaningful in any way. Other general nostalgia being forced. Perfect example is the Sol Blade. How did it get from Isaac/Felix's hands to the place in DD? Why did it even need to come back?   What I want is:     A narrative that stands or falls on its own merit. Using previous characters and shrouding it in ""mystery"" doesn't produce a compelling narrative. The mystery in TLA was so good only because it was part 2 of the narrative already established in GS. Good character development. What is the motivation of the heroes and villains? How to the heroes grow? Difficult puzzles Involving Alex. He was my favorite character in the original 2 and they set it up so well for him and Isaac to clash. Now that they reintroduced him in DD, that already established storyline and motive for Alex can be used. If they kept that simple and built from there it would be great. DD introduced so many new things unrelated to that plot arc and so many old things just for nostalgia, that it drowned what could have been great."
GoldenSun,28sksv,ProperlyBasic,5,Mon Jun 23 03:00:13 2014 UTC,Because DD flopped so badly there is almost no chance we will ever see another golden sun game. I really hope I'm wrong though.
GoldenSun,28sksv,Huegalo,7,Sun Jun 22 20:42:20 2014 UTC,There was a comment from Camelot about a GS4 saying if they got enough support they'd consider it. Not to mention with GS coming to WiiU virtual console and them making a new Camelot RPG it may drum up the support needed.
GoldenSun,28sksv,Lukar115,5,Sun Jun 22 21:27:24 2014 UTC,"I re-bought Golden Sun on the Virtual Console apecifically so I could support the series, and so that once its Club Nintendo survey is ready, I can say that I will give them my whole wallet if they make Golden Sun 4. T_T"
GoldenSun,28sksv,Lukar115,3,Wed Jul 2 18:57:33 2014 UTC,I hope they get the message! Are they exactly the same as the GBA versions or are there slight differences?
GoldenSun,28sksv,Lukar115,2,Wed Jul 2 20:22:32 2014 UTC,"The games? Yeah, they're the same. TLA isn't on Wii U at the moment, but GS is just an emulated version of the original, with a few extras that're available for other GBA games on Wii U (Save states, mappable controls, full copies of the original manual/maps, etc.).  I think the only change in the game is the removal of multiplayer stuff, since GBA VC games don't have multiplayer support."
GoldenSun,28sksv,Nicktheduck,2,Wed Jul 2 20:37:19 2014 UTC,"Ah ok that sounds reasonable, I hope when TLA is released they have a better system than the passwords for transferring over data."

I like to think that the enemies would be the tuaparang because we know so little about them.   Another idea could be maybe Alex learned to harness the golden sun to almost its full extent and was able to time travel back in time. Isaac with part of the golden sun takes the whole tla crew back in time to stop Alex from what he's up to. During the travel the two parties get mixed up (Isaac, jenna, piers Ivan in team 1, felix, garet, sheba, and mia in team 2). They can't get together because of some physical obstacle so you switch teams at certain checkpoints along the game."
GoldenSun,28sksv,Talooka,1 point,Sun Jun 22 16:11:28 2014 UTC,"The switching teams thing sounds interesting, would it be done frequently or infrequently? If it's done frequently it might get a bit tedious to follow the plot at times, however if it's done infrequently you'll find yourself annoyed over one teams lack of power over the other and lack of good items. Or maybe it'll just make it more interesting... who knows."
GoldenSun,28sksv,Renverse,2,Sun Jun 22 16:42:10 2014 UTC,"Therein lies the problem, it would have to be a delicate balance or you could switch manually like in gta v. I think maybe the manual switch would be better."
GoldenSun,28sksv,blackteadrinker,1 point,Sun Jun 22 16:46:00 2014 UTC,"Although then if young gamers did get into the game they'd likely invest all their time in one party (Reaching as far as possible with them) making them really powerful and discovering a lot of story (with gaping holes of information that would infuriate them) and then have to revert to an incredibly weak party in comparison. That might deter some younger people (which we would need to make the game succesful, even if it's not aimed with them as a target audience. I know I loved the GS games when I was but a child)."
GoldenSun,28sksv,yalue,2,Sun Jun 22 16:51:46 2014 UTC,"Okay, going back in time allows them to learn new/different psynergy. Ivan and sheba learn how to communicate telepathically from any distance. Cut scenes occur when one team needs an item and another adept has the power to warp reality in small amounts so small items can be transferred from one team to another? You can still switch wherever you want but you can't progress the story until you get the required item."

I didn't like how Camelot changed Weyard, so that would be a safe bet to get more Golden Sun and not taint our memories of the old games. So even though DD happened, maybe we could just have new characters and a new world and forget about DD. A prequel would also be damn cool though."
GoldenSun,28sksv,ExecutiveDave,4,Mon Jun 23 10:09:28 2014 UTC,"Did you ever play Final Fantasy 3? It has a moment where you take a flying ship off the edge of the ""overworld"" for the first part of the game, which turns out to be a small flying island over a much larger overworld. I wouldn't really recommend FFIII in general, but that moment was awesome.  So, it's been done in other games, but something even remotely similar would have been a great fit for a sequel to TLA."
GoldenSun,28sksv,Arrlan,2,Mon Jun 23 13:59:18 2014 UTC,I always assumed that Weyard was in fact flat and that Gaia falls were always a part of it. The void you see up in the frozen north and the shrinking of continents was what they were trying to avoid. However it could make sense that the expanding of Gaia Falls hid some areas of Weyard from us.
GoldenSun,28fnni,chubbyninja1,9,Wed Jun 18 04:43:44 2014 UTC,"I'v been trying to think of a way to express my viewpoint, and I think you've hit the nail on the head.

There's a lot of new stuff everywhere - I would argue, too much new stuff - and a lot of it doesn't really tie in to the stuff we're already familiar with."
GoldenSun,28fnni,OctopodesoftheSea,5,Wed Jun 18 09:50:56 2014 UTC,"To add to what you guys said, I think GSDD is changed and kept the wrong things. Its supposed to be a sequel, and yet they gave us an entirely new world and hardly kept any continuity from the previous one. And since it's a sequel the gameplay should be fresh, but instead we got the same old psynergies, items, and mechanics. It almost feels like I'm playing a bad clone instead of a sequel."
GoldenSun,28fnni,harveycabaguio,5,Wed Jun 18 22:30:22 2014 UTC,I don't like how it ended with all of the loose ends and I have yet to hear about a fourth to tie everything up.
GoldenSun,28fnni,Derp1121,7,Thu Jun 19 03:48:28 2014 UTC,"That is the real kicker for me, why make a sequel to the originals only to leave us with a cliff hanger and no promise to finish the story they have now started. If they are not going to make the 4th, they never should have made the 3rd."

GoldenSun,28fnni,fractalJester,1 point,Wed Jun 18 14:42:43 2014 UTC,"Exactly my issue, and honestly the only issue that frustrates me. I can accept that it was easier and arguably more young-oriented, because it was on a new system, meaning this was an attempt to lure in more younglings to start a possible franchise boost (see: Pokemon X/Y's difficulty compared to pretty much every predecessor).  But a story that felt that incomplete? Yeah, you stopped the Eclipse but you end up going back and whoop the main plot element from the very beginning is still a thing.  It was clearly leaving things open for a sequel... but unless I've missed some important news, the most we've gotten on that front is ""eh, if enough people ask for it."" And that's just bullocks.  EDIT: How do blackbox spoiler"
GoldenSun,28fnni,shmuklidooha,2,Wed Jun 18 06:39:51 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that's one thing that really annoyed me. The bosses were really easy! for all of them except Dullahan and the final boss, all you need to do is give them one round of your best summons and that's it."

Isaac, Garret and djinns helping you in the first area.   Way to many reactions.   The map on the upper screen showing you which way would lead you to the finish-line or to chests.  It was a bit too unrelated from the first games.  Eoleo and Himi seemed forced in there without backstory to get eight adepts.   Loose ends.   Maybe more that I can't think of just now.

'Cause I hold the first two books quite dear, but especially well-written they were not. Writing-wise DD was about on par with its predecessors. What killed it for fans, I think was how the sequel basically ignored a lot of what had been set up in the past two games. Me, I thought the puzzles and battles were quite fun in DD, no problems there, but the story and worldbuilding not only hadn't improved in quality in the years since the first two games were released, but they had nothing to do with the story we had let into our hearts back in the day."
GoldenSun,28fnni,Implacable_Porifera,3,Sat Jun 21 16:53:34 2014 UTC,"Obviously this comes down to opinion, however, in the first two games each character is introduced slowly. We are given their purpose for joining , as well as their back story. We don't get more than. 4 party members in the first game so the four we foo meet can be given the screen time they need to become loveable . The second game follows suit, giving us tons of time to learn about the new cast before meeting up with the old guys. Every character has a valid reason for tagging along woth the group that. Wasn't just ""let's save the world!"". It was ""I need help to save my master from lonpa"" or ""help me save my village"". In DD everyone is introduced so suddenly and without real relatable purpose that even though I beat that game, I can't tell you a single playable characters name in it."
GoldenSun,28fnni,Dracobolt,2,Thu Jun 19 03:44:54 2014 UTC,"While you're mostly spot on about the writing, there is one way in which DD is much worse than the first two.  Everyone reacts to everything all the god damn time.  In the first two this didn't happen as much and when it did it was less noticeable because it meant three or four people talking rather than eight.  Plus, no one has been able to replace the awesomeness of Saturos and Menardi.  One of the original's strengths was the fact that they were actually kind of menacing.  Also I thought the beast people were stupid.  Garo was cooler.  mic drop"
GoldenSun,28fnni,Implacable_Porifera,3,Thu Jun 19 05:24:31 2014 UTC,"Everyone reacts to everything all the god damn time.   I will not deny this. That Awkward Zombie comic is completely accurate. That was super annoying. The original game had a lot of repetitive conversations, but there at least wasn't quite so much reacting, true.  Also agreed on Saturos and Menardi. They were jerks, but they made for great villains, noble intentions or not. And Garoh was pretty cool. The Belinsk beast people look like they got lost on their way to animal crossing, except Sveta, the only one who looks more humanoid than beast, probably because her sex appeal needed to be straightforward without any confusing bestiality. Although Garoh and Belinsk is just another example of Camelot reinventing the wheel in DD. They already had beast people affected by Psynergy! Why not give us more of the established werewolves? Heck, tie it into the whole lunar thing and Anemos and just generally explore stuff they already introduced?"

I mean, the whole reason you go on the adventure in the first place is because some kid crashes a plane and you need to get a feather for the plane to work again. Not exactly the stuff of an ""epic adventure."" The first part of the game basically plays out like an extremely bloated fetch quest with totally unlikable characters, and the game unfortunately does not get better when the actual plot starts to materialize."

GoldenSun,26ehsx,epsilon526,4,Sat May 24 21:28:12 2014 UTC,"Since your Isaac is set up as a Necromage, I assume you'll be using Psynergy a lot, since Call Dullahan is such a beautiful skill. Might be a good idea to give the Cookies to Isaac.  Mints should go to the slowest of the bunch, Power Bread and Hard Nuts for the one with the lowest HP/Defense (your Healer, probably).  Luck is a bit more tricky. You only gain immunity from all statuses if you have 40+ Luck, and that's pretty hard to get on a single character.  Also, if you have the time, get a Psychic Circlet to replace that Crown of Glory on Mia."
GoldenSun,26ehsx,CakesXD,1 point,Sun May 25 03:41:53 2014 UTC,Thanks for the advice! I'll be doing that.
GoldenSun,26ehsx,JetTractor,1 point,Mon May 26 22:42:02 2014 UTC,"I did this once in Golden Sun and it seemed to work okay:  Give everything to Mia. Or at least all the defense / HP / speed boosting items.  If you do that, your main healer can now heal damaged party member before a monster can finish them off, and they'll be harder to kill, so it's less likely that their death will cripple your party.  Then give her a few Water of Lifes in case Isaac dies.  But I always use the standard Djinn setup and try to keep Psynergy to a minimum."
GoldenSun,26ehsx,RivetSpawn,1 point,Sat May 31 23:21:41 2014 UTC,"Unless it's vital to the survival of an adept such as hp and defense on Ivan, you're generally best off playing to peoples strengths due to the multiplying nature of the class system.  The 130% modifier for luck on your Angel will make any lucky peppers work harder for you on her, as opposed to say 90% on master. Also Mia has naturally high luck it shouldn't be too hard to max it with the help of some gear, a couple of lucky peppers on a low multiplier will be unnoticeable compared to the solid strategy of rendering your status healer immune to those things.  Id be temped to try and pickup more crown of glorys or psychic circlets for your mages then cookies can be to taste.. again your spellcasters will get the most increase from the cookie, but it can be nice to boost the adepts with miserably low pools.  Mints usually want to go to the slower adepts, if ivan already has the highest agility, chances are he will gain the most stat from the item but raising it higher will be useless anyway.  Apples would work much harder for you on Master than on a Necromage etc.. In the end it really is all just to taste but maxing luck is a solid thing!"

Now the hardest boss for me recently would have to be the Sentinel (no Psynergy means no Plume Edge :(  ).

Needless to say, that battle was just as hard as fighting brock in pokemon yellow version with only pikachu lol I had nooooooooo idea what I got myself into. As for the hardest boss when I finally learned to train my team? I'd say Star Magician as well. Healing himself was so dumb. Took me at least 3 or 4 tries."

On my first playthrough, I didn't even notice that I have to climb the mountain to beat it. So I instantly ran into that beast without any lights on... This was really frustrating. Also I remembered running into poseidon without trident...  But Star Magician, IMO, wasn't as hard to beat as everybody says. He has no djinn storm and therefore I can beat him easily. (I did run into him with no knowledge of him being really strong so he did obliterate me a few times, though). When beating him on my second or third playthrough, I even tried to let him alive as long as possible in order to farm exp xD  Dullahan was really hard for me, since that's the only boss I have never beat without a summon rush :/  So, for me it's the freaking serpent.

GoldenSun,21cfh3,Bob-Kyle,2,Tue Mar 25 22:50:28 2014 UTC,"This is awesome man, I'd love to try and help in some way but I know very little about minecraft and its capabilities and limitations. never had a comp powerful enough to play it (but I do own it!)  But as a budding game designer, if you're making a minecraft version of Golden Sun here would be my suggestions:  Firstly, is the 'main character' going to be an all encompassing adept? i.e have access to all four elements or will there be a way to change in between them? (Or in the long run, maybe let 4 people play at once, one as each adept so that you literally work together to solve puzzles.) For the purposes of these ideas I'll assume that you are one character who can switch between the 4 elements at will.  With combat, have it be intuitive to the types of mobs that you can put in minecarft. There won't be the turn-based system so I would have maybe 3 different types of ""Combat"" psynergy like an attack, a support and a defensive move for each element.  Secondly, maybe in combat have your character 'locked' into the adept that they were at the time. This will create meaningful strategic choices for the player and forces them to finish combat before continuing with puzzles. And have the 'run' option just be if you can make it a certain distance from the mob then it disappears.  Venus: Move (Maybe have it just be a big Knockback effect? moreso than the 'field' use of 1 block'), Cure (self explanatory) and some sort of attacking psynergy like Growth (Use reeds/sugarcane for visual?) that actually does damage? Ragnarok if it can be done but i doubt it.  Mercury: Frost (Freeze enemy in place for a couple of seconds but have attacks do no damage to it), Ply (see Cure), Deluge (A bunch of water blocks fall on it from above? maybe you can rig it to do damage as well)  Mars: Burst (Some sort of TNT explosion that does damage), Lava shower (... use lava), Guard (Ups defense, gives armor)  Jupiter: Plasma (There's already lightning in minecraft, shouldn't be too hard)  Impact (Raises attack), Whirlwind (Not quite sure how to implement)  for all of these I'd imagine just have a slight delay from buttonpress to use so that they don't completely outclass fighting with just weapons. This will need playtesting to balance right.  I'd love to help more if I can so chuck me a pm if you want to talk more about this."
GoldenSun,21cfh3,BloodChicken,1 point,Wed Mar 26 10:20:24 2014 UTC,The reason I had move/frost/whirlwind/burst in there as combat psynergy is that you should be able to just change the effect of what happens when it's used on mobs as opposed to blocks so it might be easier and more streamlined in the long run to just have the one item applicable to both scenarios.
GoldenSun,21cfh3,BloodChicken,1 point,Wed Mar 26 10:22:02 2014 UTC,"First: Thank you for the detailed post! This is the sort of discussion I am looking for! Second: My plan for Psynergy alotment is ""One Player, One Element"".    (I was unsure about making this mod due to people not being able to work together... then I saw Twitch Plays Pokemon, and realized: if ~50000 people can work play a game and beat it, certainly 4 people can work tegether)   Third: Combat is not a priority right now. I want to have a good framework in place before I start on combat.   (Also, I have no plans of trying to implement combat in any way similar to GS... Note: this might not apply to boss battles..... food for thought :P)   Fourth: I might hear cries of ""Blasphemy"" after I say this, but, if the elemental affinity of a Psynergy is tenuous.... lets just say I have no qualms changing the affinity.   (I 'gotta share the love when it comes to elements and their Psynergy. ie. Jupiter and Venus have TONS of Mainline utility Psynergy; Mars only has a few.)   Fifth: I saw what you said about Ragnarok, and this is what I have to say:   ""Ragnarok will be EASY to make"" :P  (FYI, Mainline is a name I have given Psynergy that are well used in GS)"
GoldenSun,21cfh3,BloodChicken,1 point,Wed Mar 26 19:22:21 2014 UTC,Ragnarok will be 12 kinds of excellent <3 It's probably my favourite psynergy :)  and I'm glad you liked the post! I love talking about this kind of thing and combining it with a passion like Golden sun and it's just a brew for success and fun if nothing else.  And yeah I totally understand the need to broaden the elements. Growth easily falls under Mars as well since you always need venus/mars together to get it anyways. And since it's all about the sunlighty type stuff it's more than fair.  Totally understand about combat being on the backburner. I was originally going to have a second part of that post about other things but I felt it was horrendously long enough and the rest could be dealt via message. I don't know how open you'd be to the idea of it but this discussion might be easier on a forum? It's really easy to set them up and I'm pretty experienced with them but it'd be a lot easier if we keep up this back and forth (and anyone else who wants to discuss it more) to be able to read through past ideas and separate things into topics  And while making this post I actually went and did that:  http://gs4minecraft.freeforums.net/  So.... it's there if you wanna use it :) Will be easier to catalogue/share thoughts that way.

GoldenSun,21cfh3,merrily_caroling,1 point,Sat Apr 5 22:13:09 2014 UTC,"for starters, it would help to state in which aspects it looks like ars magica, because the way i understand ars magica is that you do research, unlock magic ""building blocks"" and then create spells with those parts.  this mod lets pick pick an element, locks you to it, immediately gives you field psynergy and attack psynergy.  in my eyes the only similarity is magic.  of course if you dont think so, its important to say why you dont think so."

If you are talking about Psynergy being tied to the use of items, then yes, unfortunately that is true.  I would love to have it all done from a Gui/seperate item bar at the bottom, but that would require a ton of packets (as I have yet to figure out an efficient way of making a more generic packet to contain all of that info) (it would also use up a ton of space from player data, which is sorta a no-no for forge modders :/)  @UnusualDisturbance: You think I'm just going to give you Psynergy! :P"

Hover- maybe a legend if zelda deal like the hover boots, activate and be able to walk over empty spaces for a short period, I can think of a bunch of times this would've come in handy.  Douse, parch, freeze - when you say ""special"" water, do you mean a new water block?  Cuz that seems extremely inconvenient. Retreat - Another LoZ idea. If you've played, basically Farores wind, activate retreat when you get to the entrance of a cave/dungeon/anything really, then use again to return to the entrance. Teleport - this is in a lot of mods, so I think just go with an enderpearl type deal. Cloak/Reveal - I think implementing the cloak onto blocks would make reveal much cooler and more strategic. Cloaking the entrance to your base and using reveal to find it.  Let me know what you think ;)"

As back up, it cited sales numbers for 1 and 2 as opposed to 3.   That being true, it would make sense that, in the lead up to announcing a new game (at e3 this year perhaps?), they would release the first two on virtual console to try and build some hype/remind people it exists."

As someone who has known the series since the beginning (GS was the first game I picked up with my GBA), and was absolutely hyped to hear that DD was a thing, I think that there is still a lot of desire for the new game from fans old and new.  And with the release of the GBA games on the WiiU, it may be likely that they are gearing up for a new release...?  On the topic of the IGN article, I just checked it, and it says it was a Wii title.  Granted, this may just be to throw suspicion off, or it may be that they had planned to make a game for the original Wii, or maybe even that they just forgot to add the U to make it WiiU.

He's not super hard if you've played the game a lot but since most people probably just used the base classes and didn't put much thought into strategy guides put a much higher level recommendation.  Also, they might be like me and get lost a lot which leads to being overleveled (even when I have a map I manage to get lost in dungeons in every rpg ever)."
GoldenSun,1zgjgz,Implacable_Porifera,3,Mon Mar 3 20:21:50 2014 UTC,"With the best items, all the Djinn, and sufficient supplies, Deadbeard could be battled with your characters from level 24-28."

GoldenSun,1zgjgz,DuBistKomisch,1 point,Tue Mar 4 02:48:39 2014 UTC,I think I might've done a summon rush once when I was about level 21-23 or something (but that doesn't really count). I think I was 25-28 when I did it 'properly'.
GoldenSun,1zgjgz,Coostabo,1 point,Tue Mar 4 14:44:06 2014 UTC,Generally those recommendations are for people who don't have all the djinns. If you have them all you can take him on at quite a low level either by summon rushing or the flash/granite tactic (both of which have already been mentioned). I generally don't use those methods (aside from summon rushing when fighting Duhallan) because they are boring. Assuming you aren't using them I'd say mid-to  -high 20's.
GoldenSun,1zgjgz,SeakingParade,1 point,Wed Mar 5 02:11:24 2014 UTC,High 20's for me (I think Garret was lv29 when I did).  Super easy if you know the game inside and out.
GoldenSun,1zgjgz,Chocobose,1 point,Tue Apr 15 17:46:37 2014 UTC,"Late to this party, but I just finished crossbone isle today actually. I had Isaac at 28 and everyone else at 27. I used flash and granite on alternating turns and used djinn with Mia and Ivan then used lvl4 summons. It took a while but it was fairly easy that way.  What I'm confused about is, I have all of these cursed items but one cleric ring, which I gave to Garrett for Muramasa and demon mail. Should i sell the rest of the cursed equipment since you only get one Cleric ring?"
GoldenSun,1zgjgz,muffinsformen,1 point,Tue May 6 18:08:44 2014 UTC,26 on each character spamming flash as much as possible. I foolishly attempted to do it while Ivan was wearing a cursed item as well that made him not do anything most of the time. However I managed it.

It was published by Sony in Japan, Working Designs in North America, and Psygnosis in Europe. It won great critical acclaim for its bizarre story and smooth game mechanics. The game's protagonist is a young man named Alundra, who learns that he has the power to enter people's dreams. He is shipwrecked near the village of Inoa and proceeds to try to help the locals, who have been suffering from a terrible curse. The narrative becomes gradually darker and more twisted as the game progresses. There is an emphasis on puzzle solving.     Picture  image source | about | /u/Melzas can reply with 'delete'.

GoldenSun,1vm1vh,Gamecubeboy,1 point,Mon Jan 20 12:14:46 2014 UTC,I added Golden Sun to my collection because visually it reminded me of Chrono Trigger.  And on a superficial level the combat is similar too.  There also simple puzzles in each game

GoldenSun,1vm1vh,Magikarpster,3,Tue Jan 21 09:55:23 2014 UTC,the mario games are almost nothing like golden sun and not anywhere near the same quality
GoldenSun,1vm1vh,VitorCarvalho,-2,Thu Jan 23 08:21:13 2014 UTC,"How are they ""almost nothing like golden sun""? They are RPGs, that are heavily focus on getting skills to help you solve puzzles in the game world and they both have backtracking elements...  The main differences between them are their themes and their battle systems (which in Mario & Luigi is more like action timed puzzles, and in Golden Sun is standard turn based).  About the quality remark..that's your opinion, a lot of people would say otherwise. I don't see where's the discrepancy in quality, that you imply to exist, between both titles."
GoldenSun,1vm1vh,SolluxCaptor2,1 point,Tue Jan 28 05:52:16 2014 UTC,"The Golden Sun games are far richer in terms of replay value and overall rpg elements, mostly due to the fact that characters can so easily switch classes and whatnot with the Djinni. I've played superstar saga, and the Mario rpgs are more like an attempt to map existing characters onto a generic rpg plot, rather than an attempt at anything innovative."
GoldenSun,1vm1vh,VitorCarvalho,0,Fri Mar 28 14:48:25 2014 UTC,"Sure, there are a ton of differences between both games, but those differences don't counter their similarities. Like it or not, they are similar games. RPGs with huge focus on skill based puzzle solving, exploring and backtracking.  I don't really think replay value is a strong point for Golden Sun (or most linear RPGs for that matter), the puzzles are the same, you already now how to solve them the second time you play, the story also doesn't change. And you're not tied to the classes you choose, you can try them all in one playthrough.  Sure the Mario kinda feels off in a RPG, but you're wrong in saying they don't attempt to innovate, their RPG mechanics stand out from most RPGs, the mixture of turn based and action battles for example.  I don't believe there's that big of a difference in quality between both games, they are both pretty good games."
GoldenSun,1vm1vh,SolluxCaptor2,1 point,Mon Mar 31 08:02:34 2014 UTC,"I was referring to the bonus bosses when discussing GS's replayability. Sorry, but Golden Sun is just a better game. Nobody is going to remember Mario and Luigi RPGs unless they're brought up in conversation, whereas GS is widely considered to be one of the best GBA games of all time."
GoldenSun,1vm1vh,VitorCarvalho,1 point,Mon Mar 31 16:28:50 2014 UTC,"Nowhere did you mentioned the bosses though, and I don't think the secret bosses help that much on the replayability department.       Sorry, but Golden Sun is just a better game.   That's your opinion. Not a fact.  Here's some perspective, Golden Sun is my favorite game of all time, I really like it, the game says something to me, everytime I hear its music I fell saudade from traveling through Weyard!  But that doesn't mean I'm blinded by it.  I don't really care that much for the Mario RPG games, but to say they lack quality compared to Golden Sun is not true. The fact that both me and you like Golden Sun more than Mario RPG doesn't make it better game, they are both great games, we just like one more than the other.  Furthermore, Floowey just asked for similar games to Golden Sun, and Mario & Luigi RPG games are it.       Nobody is going to remember Mario and Luigi RPGs unless they're brought up in conversation, whereas GS is widely considered to be one of the best GBA games of all time.   Maybe not you or the people in the circles you live in, but tons of people believe Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga to be one of the best GBA games of all time. To believe that only the game you like will be regarded as the best by everyone is just narrow minded.  Edit: Made a quick search on google for ""best gba game"", the first five links were:   IGN Top 25 GBA Games; GamesRadar Best GBA Games; Wikipedias' list of best selling GBA games; Coolrom's Top 50 GBA downloads; UK Official Nintendo Magazine's Top 10 Best GBA Games;   And, somewhat to my surprise, in none of the lists is Golden Sun ahead of Superstar Saga. So, yeah, I don't think people are going to have trouble remembering it."

GoldenSun,1rz6lu,sysyphys,7,Tue Dec 3 06:26:33 2013 UTC,"I have mixed feelings about petitioning for a Golden Sun 4. If what is said is correct about Camelot making a new GS if they have enough fan support, then I think there is really something inherently wrong with that. The end of TLA, in its own right, pretty much demanded its own sequel--that sequel didn't come until years later, when much of GS's fan base had moved on from the series. And what we got was something which I wouldn't call an adequate sequel at all--dragged out storyline, loads of filler, hardly any character development, and yet another cliffhanger. When the developers of a game leave the words ""the end?"" at the end of a game, it should be their obligation to finish what they started, regardless if there is large fan support or not. If they didn't think the game would sell very well, they could have at least dropped the question mark and left it as ""the end"".  Now, I'm not completely against a sequel to DD--it just has to be done right, by having a proper story line, interesting characters, etc. (I have no doubt that the music will remain excellent.) Most of all, though, this game needs to have closure--every story element needs to be answered by the end of the game. DD was horribly open-ended and many things in the game are left unexplained fully. I would hate to see such a thing in a fourth installment to the series.  As for graphics, I don't really care if they do 3D or 2D, but whichever one they pick, they should do it well. Camelot is fairly experienced in 2D graphics, so that would probably be the sensible direction to go with."
GoldenSun,1rz6lu,TeaLiger,3,Tue Dec 3 21:46:48 2013 UTC,"Exactly, DD had the name but not the soul of Golden Sun"
GoldenSun,1rz6lu,sysyphys,2,Wed Dec 4 01:30:23 2013 UTC,"I agree. DD was a massive disappointment for me because it didn't really introduce anything new besides a different layout. What really bother me though is that it went unresolved and has that tummy-angering cliffhanger. I just hope for a fourth one so that it resolves the story, kind of like how TLA did with the original.    TLA was like a bigger, better version of the original and I hope that GS 4 will be somewhat the same as DD. I really want to sail the entire map like I did in TLA. Also, DD left out so many warriors of Vale :("
GoldenSun,1rz6lu,wixie1016,2,Wed Dec 4 02:24:02 2013 UTC,"Also, DD left out so many warriors of Vale :(   Yes, this was rather disappointing. If would love to see the full cast from the original games. What would be even better is if said characters are actually playable. You know, just bump a few unimportant characters from DD and replace them with adepts from the original games for the respective element."

GoldenSun,1rmkc7,FarNorth22,5,Thu Nov 28 04:58:52 2013 UTC,"Djinn have three purposes:  1) Make a character stronger 2) Be used in a summon 3) An ability (such as to damage an enemy, create a shield etc), which is unique to each Djinn.  The more Djinn you have Set to one character, the more powerful that character will become. In addition to gaining stat bonuses, having more Djinn set on a character will cause them to change class (think Pokemon and evolving, but temporary), which makes the character even more powerful and can give them new/different moves.   The more Djinn you have on Standby, the more powerful summons you can perform. Summons are the most powerful moves in the game, and should be your go-to moves in boss battles. However, a Djinn that's on standby won't confer any bonuses to a character or change their class.   After a summon is used, the Djinn used in the summon are in Recovery, which means they can neither be summoned nor provide stat bonuses. They will then return to Set mode.  If a Djinn is Set, and your character ""uses"" it (to damage an enemy, restore their health etc) for their turn, then the Djinn will change to standby. On the one hand, this leaves the Djinn ready to be summoned; on the other hand, it will most likely weaken your character (by removing the stat bonuses the Djinn was giving them while it was ""Set""). So in tougher battles, it's important to maintain a balance between being able to use powerful summons (having Djinn on Standby) and not weakening your characters too much (having Djinn on Set).  Generally, I like to keep it simple and put Djinn of an element with the Adept of that element - Earth with Earth etc - and will for the most part just have Djinn Set and then use their abilities as required, then use a summon now and again to return my used (remember, using a Djinn puts them into Standby) Djinn to Set. The exception to this is boss battles, where I'll go into the battle with most of my Djinn on Standby - allowing me to release a flurry of powerful summons right out of the gate. That's just the way I play it though; you might find you have a different style : )  Hope that helps!"
GoldenSun,1rmkc7,SirPterodactyl,3,Thu Nov 28 06:16:07 2013 UTC,You sir are awesome. That makes much more sense now. Is there any djinn combos I should be aware of that are good? Or should I just experiment?
GoldenSun,1rmkc7,SirPterodactyl,1 point,Thu Nov 28 06:26:19 2013 UTC,"Do you mean combos as in Summons? Or combos as in different combinations of different elemental Djinn assigned to a certain character?  For the former (summons), there are loads of awesome combo summons which utilise 2 different elements of Djinn. My personal favourite is Eclipse (3 air 2 water, I think; it's been a while lol) but all of them are good. The more Djinn used in a summon, the more damage you'll do. Isis, which is the most powerful (9 fire/4 water? Or the other way round?) both does massive damage and heals your party - but it can take a lot of time to build up enough Djinn to Standby.  If terms of  Djinn combinations changing characters into special classes, I never really did this - I just stuck Djinn to Adepts of the same element to keep it simple. I wasn't very adventurous lol. But there are lots of good combinations out there; maybe see the Golden Sun wiki page for an exhaustive list, or just experiment moving Djinn around from person to person and see what you can make."
GoldenSun,1rmkc7,rockinjewfro9,3,Thu Nov 28 06:54:22 2013 UTC,I did the same as SirPterodactyl with keeping djinn on characters of the same element and putting all my djinn on standby before a boss fight. One tip I would give is if you do put all your djinn on standby before a boss battle the order you set them will be the order they come back in the battle. So you can put the djinn that will be most useful in battle on standby first so that you don't have to wait several turns to be able to use them
GoldenSun,1rmkc7,SirPterodactyl,1 point,Thu Nov 28 18:15:56 2013 UTC,"This all the way. I forgot to mention that Djinn only ""Recover"" one at a time; so the order you put them in Standby is incredibly important."

You'll have more than enough of this stuff by the time Isaac's group joins, and by that point in the game you'll have good healing Psynergy anyway. Don't bring the Hermes Water, it's completely useless in GSII. Don't bring Game Tickets or Lucky Medals, as again, you'll get plenty of these in GSII.  Focus on getting as many artifact weapons as possible. Buy back all of the ones you've sold to the shops. You're missing some of my favourite weapons - the Mystery Blade (Crossbone Isle) and Assassins Blade (Tolbi Fountain)."

GoldenSun,1r0sfn,macka7,4,Wed Nov 20 03:08:50 2013 UTC,Use the Hermes water as a potion and then sell the bottle.  You have all the top tier stuff - now it's just about filling out your inventory with artifact weapons you can't get in GSII...which is pretty much all of them.

I agree with macka7's suggestion, and further emphasize carrying around unique artifacts. Like, I see you have at least 3 Kikuichimonji. There's really no need for that in that they'll be outclassed anyway and just take up space. Go for maximum breadth of items, literally only those things unique to GS.  Edit: Nuts2Face is totally right. Lure Cap is a priority."
GoldenSun,1r0sfn,Sensei_Wally,2,Wed Nov 20 15:52:02 2013 UTC,"Make sure to get the cleric's ring. That way, one of your players can use the Darksword, the most powerful sword in the game.

GoldenSun,1odxry,Cadvan88,4,Mon Oct 14 12:39:18 2013 UTC,"I really like the sounds. In particular when you talk to people and you hesr squeaking. Also, the music is sometimes wow. Like Tundaria Tower or Venus Lighthouse. I love listening to a couple. Venus Lighthouse is probably the most epic from the game."
GoldenSun,1odxry,ifrit1100,1 point,Mon Oct 14 01:58:44 2013 UTC,I love the sounds too. The sound when you press A at a menu in the GBA games was my text message alert sound for a while.
GoldenSun,1odxry,punspinner,7,Fri Oct 18 14:02:13 2013 UTC,"how absolutely badass the djinn moves are, and how every time you attack or do something it seems extremely epic."
GoldenSun,1odxry,sufjan_stevens,3,Mon Oct 14 06:03:05 2013 UTC,"I have only played TLA (I'm so sorry, I could never get my hands on Golden Sun for some reason), so my experience is not the same as yours. However, I played TLA several times, and the aspect of the game I like most is the desperation. As the story progresses, we really see Weyward begin to crumble at our hand, and we're not sure if we can fix it - it's unclear if we're even making the right choices for the good of the world.   As the plot unfolds, we see the broader implications to our actions and begin to understand how all the people and actions are intertwined, and our quest becomes more important. Boss battles matter more. The inclusion of the elemental rocks (air's rock, magma rock,  etc) show that our characters are doing everything they can to increase their elemental power with the new spells each respective adept acquires from their respective rock.  By the time I reached Prox, there was actually a heavy, hopeless feeling in my chest, because the citizens of the hometown whose warriors we had been fighting for our entire quest are on their knees begging us to help them. The battle to the aerie of Mars Lighthouse, ending in a fight against our own parents, was the ultimate blow, and I think that the game flawlessly built up to such an epic conclusion.  Furthermore, the huge amount of side quests such as finding all djinn and fighting the multiple super bosses that granted new summons made the game new and playable for scores of hours."
GoldenSun,1odxry,DrSterling,2,Thu Oct 17 02:57:14 2013 UTC,"If you could, maybe emulate it? It's not my favorite method but it works. The first one felt a lot more personal and I loved it more for that."

GoldenSun,1odxry,FlingNoodles,2,Sun Oct 20 19:30:50 2013 UTC,Definitely the music! The storyline is pretty amazing as well.
GoldenSun,1odxry,Andr007,1 point,Tue Dec 24 16:08:12 2013 UTC,"I liked that I purchased the original GS without any previous knowledge of the game. It was probably the most pleasant surprise I've ever had in video gaming. The style, artwork, music, gameplay, and epic-ness of the game just blew me away. When the original group got on the ship at the end, I could feel it was going to end. When TLA came out, it brought a sense of closure to the original storyline.   I do wish that they'd make a new game in the style of the first two."
GoldenSun,1odxry,n-Star,1 point,Tue Oct 22 01:26:43 2013 UTC,"The commercial for this game was incredible first of all. Blew my 12 year old mind. Probably the first major rpg I played when I was younger. the summon sequences were incredible. 7 years later, I bought a new copy of it because I love this game so much. Frankly it is the battle system in my later / current years that makes me love it. Just the fun and challenge of strategically trying to set up a certain kind of battle flow was enough for me in my later years to go back in play it. Battles would tell a story, a race to a climax as you tried to summon Judgement, then for the next few turns, do what you had with the classes left available as your djin returned to you before you could strike again and again. Never played another game with this kind of rush."
GoldenSun,1odxry,mctastee88,1 point,Fri Nov 1 18:51:26 2013 UTC,"Mostly the music and environment. Everything about the two just fit. Also, they did a really good job of making the game feel like an adventure, while the game was still essentially go from point A to point B there were a lot of little things you could do here and there along the way.  Another thing, as synapsii said, is the battle system. Honestly, I think the golden sun series (minus dark dawn) is probably the greatest RPG series of all time."
GoldenSun,1odxry,batdrumman,1 point,Fri Nov 8 06:25:23 2013 UTC,Talking to stoves. There is always some funny random crap that is used as text.

GoldenSun,1o8gjy,twelveovertwo,12,Fri Oct 11 17:46:20 2013 UTC,"Everyone is negative because it is truly the worst of the series. The plot is just not the same level of epic journey as the previous ones and isn't focused either. Then there's the ending...  Anyway that's irrelevant for you. Just know that there ARE points of no return so follow a djinn guide to make sure you don't miss any (just another reason why this game isn't as good).  You really should play the first two after though, they are superior in almost every way and will make the plot of this game more interesting."
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,Ruwn,10,Fri Oct 11 18:40:54 2013 UTC,"To be fair, though; the first two were among the greatest games on their system. It's gonna be hard to live up to that no matter what."
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,AManHasSpoken,1 point,Fri Oct 11 21:30:26 2013 UTC,In the first two games there were points of no return as far as Djinn's if I remember right?
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,muffinsformen,7,Fri Oct 11 23:40:30 2013 UTC,Nope you were able to backtrack (and in some cases had to for certain djinn) through both gba games completely
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,MasterRiven,2,Fri Oct 11 23:43:06 2013 UTC,"Oh fair point, I must have linked my laziness with inability then xD"
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,muffinsformen,9,Sat Oct 12 00:22:11 2013 UTC,"Just going to say I support your decision of playing dark dawn first. Reasons being that while it is the worst game of the series I think standalone it would've been counted as a great game. You're lucky because you can play that game and enjoy it and then play the other two and enjoy them more, while for the rest of us we played the others, loved them and then felt disappointed."
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,muffinsformen,6,Fri Oct 11 23:39:15 2013 UTC,That's a good point.
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,e1337ist,4,Sat Oct 12 00:07:02 2013 UTC,"Basically, the negative comments are because this game is the weakest in the series.  It isn't that it's a bad game; it just has to compete with 2 of what many consider to be the best games in the genre (at the very, 2 of the best games in the genre for that system).  Despite it being a sequel, you won't have too much spoiled/ be too confused by playing DD first."
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,Implacable_Porifera,2,Sat Oct 12 00:18:04 2013 UTC,Yes. Play Golden Sun and Golden Sun The Lost Age First.
GoldenSun,1o8gjy,e1337ist,5,Fri Oct 11 18:30:13 2013 UTC,No he should complete this first so he can actually enjoy this game xD

I have all Djinn and events from the first game (no high level chars though) and I think I have all the TLA djinn so far as well (been a while since I last played this game).

GoldenSun,1o78sj,CenturiousUbiquitous,7,Fri Oct 11 05:13:57 2013 UTC,"Everything. Bit of a cop-out, but they introduced so much new lore in Dark Dawn of which very little got any extensive explanation.  If I had to choose one thing, it'd be the Psynergy Vortexes. They're so mysterious, and I was intrigued by them right from the first Dark Dawn trailer. But they were never really explained in game, and I really want to know more about them and where they come from."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,Icaden,2,Fri Oct 11 06:14:40 2013 UTC,"Judging by the ending, they will be the centerpiece of the eventual sequel."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,AManHasSpoken,3,Fri Oct 11 10:24:02 2013 UTC,"That's my hope, should that sequel ever come."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,Icaden,1 point,Fri Oct 11 14:52:39 2013 UTC,"To add to everything, all the weapons, summons, and secret bosses.  Now if they make (which I hope they do) a sequel, they have to one-up the Sol Blade, Iris, and Dullahan.  Makes me ponder on how Camelot will approach that."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,PhatBoiRL,8,Fri Oct 11 08:55:55 2013 UTC,I'm surprised we didn't see anything about Anemos. A city on the moon?
GoldenSun,1o78sj,AManHasSpoken,7,Fri Oct 11 10:25:13 2013 UTC,"1) I hated how all these amazing machines were hidden and now pop up conveniently. The cities that were previously buried are now horizontal and mostly perfect... the machines aren't damaged... it's as if this is a different Weyard! I dislike how they use the continental shift as a way to make new stuff like Luna Tower pop up. Also great wall? Are you telling me the release of psynergy perfectly made the Apollo Lens, Luna tower, AND both alchemy machines appear on land perfectly?    2) Coldsnap. Wtf. No need for it. Keep to Frost.  3) There seems to be a big chunk of new history like the Jenei. You telling me no one heard of them before? Suddenly all this old lore has appeared that no one knew of before.  I think they should have focused on the Ankohl civilisation. That and Lemuria we know are quite ancient.  What about ANEMOS? No need to create fake civilisations for DD! It would have been cool if many ruins and stuff appeared after TLA and people would dig there to find treasure. This might be illegal in some areas. Perhaps someone unlocks some old Anemos or Ankohl tech which causes the vortexs to appear. At least we would be more familiar with the world. It wouldn't be like they're pulling a story out of their asses."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,ifrit1100,3,Fri Oct 11 15:20:43 2013 UTC,"Yeah... I really thought they would come up with some history for Venus and Jupiter clans by using Ankohl and Anemos since the first two games were mostly about Mars and Mercury clans (Prox, Imil and Lemuria).  I actually like the concept behind the Jenei and Exathi but I think it was way too early to introduce them to the game and I'm sure it could've been executed differently. They should've finished the clans of the four basic elements first and then introduced us to Jenei and Exathi later on. And maybe rewrite it so that the Exathi had built the lighthouses instead of some weird alchemy machines and lenses."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,Coostabo,1 point,Fri Oct 11 17:28:20 2013 UTC,Sigh Camelot... It would be cool if for Jupiter we saw that whirlwind babe as an adult! Recruit her + Eoleo + Himi's brother. Himi's power is so lame as a story element. Divine messages from whom? Her power was like a dues ex machina. I wonder if they'll explain it in the next game as perhaps the Wise One communicating.
GoldenSun,1o78sj,ifrit1100,1 point,Fri Oct 11 17:41:53 2013 UTC,"I didn't take it as all the new places popping out of nowhere, but rather that for the old cast these places weren't as accessible or they simply didn't get the chance to explore them on their path.  The giant Isaac walking across the miniature Weyard is just for practical purposes xD The characters wouldn't have actually checked out every single bit of Angara on their journey."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,SaiphCharon,2,Sat Dec 14 23:38:53 2013 UTC,"I really wish they didn't include so many main characters... the GBA games fleshed out four (well three because hans/felix don't talk) per game, but eight? I dunno, something just didn't brush the right way about that."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,shmuklidooha,2,Fri Oct 11 09:44:23 2013 UTC,"I like how they followed up on the conversation back in Lemuria and made some changes to the map. I'd love to see how Gondowan, Indra, Osenia and whatever lies in Western Sea looks like now.  On the other hand I think that while it was nice to see some new towns and cities, some of them seemed a bit out of place. Ayuthay seemed way too old considering the fact that it had only been built 30-something years ago. They didn't mention big cities like Tolbi either so I wonder what happened to that (or maybe they did mention it and I just don't remember... It's been a while).  Oh and The Wise One. I wonder he's been up to with all those statues scattered around everywhere."
GoldenSun,1o78sj,Coostabo,1 point,Fri Oct 11 15:05:31 2013 UTC,"I personally was interested in finding out more about the troubles Border Town were facing, even if it was relatively small. Was kinda hoping to see the resolution to that lockdown, but was a bit disappointed when it got locked from the rest of the game.  I do agree with many of the complaints, such as, where in the world did all threw new ancient civilizations come from and why didn't I hear of them before. It's not really a small addition, but it's still frustrating.  Glad to see so many fans interested in a conversation here."

GoldenSun,1nurg1,Eliwood_of_Pherae,3,Sun Oct 6 18:12:23 2013 UTC,"Assuming I'm thinking of the correct forest, it's supposed to be impossible to make it through the forest without the Force Orb, as the Orb is required to clear pathes through. I don't know how you managed it.   Regardless, no, you cannot backtrack through the forest. However once you reach a certain point in the game, the bridge from Vale to Kalay is repaired, and you can backtrack to the beginning parts of the game.  NEdit: Just looked it up. It's possible to get through the forest without it (although very time consuming, that's insanity). You don't really NEED Force for most of the game. You can go back and get it later, however."
GoldenSun,1nurg1,Carthiah,2,Sun Oct 6 18:43:36 2013 UTC,"Oh. And no, it's not impossible, you just walk through."
GoldenSun,1nurg1,Carthiah,2,Sun Oct 6 18:45:03 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I originally thought that the game would impede your progress until you used Force correctly on the stumps. Then I looked it up. Just go back and get the Orb(And all the other goodies in the cave) later."

It doesn't do anything in battle and there's only 1 other point where you need it to advance the plot, but if you don't have the force orb then the game will account for this and let you progress normally."

However i found that Chrono trigger was a very good game and a little similar, check it out"
GoldenSun,1lx5bg,Melzas,3,Sun Sep 8 03:12:36 2013 UTC,"I'll check it out, thanks :)"
GoldenSun,1lx5bg,Dracobolt,3,Sun Sep 8 08:00:46 2013 UTC,"Skies of Arcadia: Legends, to me, has a lot of the same feelings attached to it. There is a sense of wonder and discovery as you explore the world and its ruins. I enjoy the magic and combat systems, even if they're only similar in that they're turn-based JRPG combat. I think Skies pulls waaaay ahead of GS in terms of characters and writing, but I think the two come out about equal in terms of plot and worldbuilding. The music is quite good, and the graphics hold up pretty well - er, that is, they're definitely dated, but they're not painful to look at, and they capture the necessary aesthetic."

GoldenSun,1lx5bg,SaiphCharon,4,Sun Sep 8 08:00:07 2013 UTC,"I'm playing Mario & Luigi Dream Team right now, which its a kind of similar game in the sense that you have to get abilities/items to solve puzzles and advance throughout the game. There also the element of backtracking, once you get a new ability you can go back to places where you've been before and reach new places which you previously couldn't. You can also equip different weapons and gear (which all look the same but do different stuff).  The element I would say is most differentiating is provably the combat, in the Mario & Luigi games the combat is more active. It's still turn-based, but in your turn you have o press the right button at the right time to execute the attack in the perfect way, and on the enemies' turn you have to try to dodge or counter their attack by again pressing the right button at the right time. This also makes the battle more like puzzle solving, cause you have to read your enemies (they always hint what they're about to do via animations) to be able to dodge them and to know how to attack them.  A game that is kinda similar but without the RPG elements (character customization, turn based battles) is The Legend of Zelda. This one is a no brainer. Golden Sun is basically 2D Zelda + RPG Elements. I would recommend A Link to the Past and Minish Cap which are provably the most similar, but feel free to check the rest of them out.  Going completely outside of the realm of top-down RPG style of game, you can try out Castlevania and Metroid. Both these series are well known for their backtracking. Gaining abilities and items that allow you to progress into the game. Going back a few rooms everytime you have some new ability to find out there was a new path or some new item in a place you previously could not reach. Having a puzzle in front of you and having to figure out what ability you need to use to solve it. This are some of the elements that made Golden Sun the game it is! Some Castlevania games even have RPG elements like leveling up, gear and weapons. I would recommend Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance,  Super Metroid,  Metroid Fusion and Metroid Zero Mission, but again, fell free to look up other games in the series.  Here's a List:   Mario & Luigi Super Star Saga GBA  Mario & Luigi Bowser's Inside Story DS  Mario & Luigi Dream Team 3DS  The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past SNES/GBA  The Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap GBA  Castlevania: Symphony of the Night PS1/XBOX360/PSN  Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow GBA  Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance GBA  Super Metroid SNES  Metroid Fusion GBA  Metroid Zero Mission GBA"

GoldenSun,1kr636,Renverse,9,Tue Aug 20 19:47:48 2013 UTC,This bit is curious because it seems to suggest that there is another side to the rift. Camelot could have used this plot point to create new lands in Weyard rather than doing what they did in GS: DD.
GoldenSun,1kr636,SmokingMarmoset,7,Tue Aug 20 19:49:10 2013 UTC,I still feel DD was more of a side story (and a poor one) than sequel to the original games. :/ I think they lost their initial vision for the series when they created it after so many years.
GoldenSun,1kr636,AManHasSpoken,6,Tue Aug 20 22:56:54 2013 UTC,"It doesn't really feel like a sequel, yeah. What with all of the ancient civilizations that suddenly appeared, they should've just set it in the distant past with an entirely new cast if they wanted to tell that story."
GoldenSun,1kr636,DjFrostixa,4,Wed Aug 21 07:47:00 2013 UTC,"Mmm yeah I agree. I didn't mind GS:DD... but I wish they'd release a fresh GS sequel/prequel/another land on 3DS with high-res 2d sprites, and head back to their roots."
GoldenSun,1kr636,BlinksTale,2,Wed Aug 21 03:15:42 2013 UTC,3d sprites even? :D
GoldenSun,1kr636,DjFrostixa,2,Wed Aug 21 07:42:22 2013 UTC,"Haha, sure! As long as it's sprite based because I feel as if every time they go 3D they begin to lose the little details that make a game good. Hand-drawn art backgrounds mixed with 2.5D sprites (illusion of 3d models). Than you are good to go!"
GoldenSun,1kr636,BlinksTale,2,Wed Aug 21 18:26:23 2013 UTC,"GS has the huge advantage of all camera movements being on a flat plane, so we'll never look up or down on the team in battle. You could definitely make twice as many sprites for this if you also never changed zoom, and make the characters have a pop on the 3DS because of it. I would love to see that, I've never seen 3D sprites before, but it would be just as easy to do as the 2D sprites."
GoldenSun,1kr636,DjFrostixa,1 point,Wed Aug 21 18:54:06 2013 UTC,"Yeah a little pop using 3D would be awesome! Yeah for sure man.

GoldenSun,1kea3h,pointsforeffort,6,Thu Aug 15 03:18:54 2013 UTC,"Red/white/yellow djinn colours are indicative of their mode (set, standby, recovery).   Sounds from your other posts here that you've got an action replay'ed version of the game. If you just met piers in Kibombo and you've completed the dungeon then I believe your next objective is to go to piers' ship, but that might be difficult with an altered game. You might just want to start your save file over."
GoldenSun,1kea3h,Carthiah,2,Thu Aug 15 05:29:56 2013 UTC,"I agree. Just start over. Chances are you don't remember the other parts that well anyway, so just start fresh. Experience it as a whole again."
GoldenSun,1kea3h,xxHikari,5,Thu Aug 15 21:15:36 2013 UTC,"All I can tell you unfortunately is that red names just mean they are in Standby mode, iirc."
GoldenSun,1kea3h,Zenrot,3,Thu Aug 15 04:15:42 2013 UTC,"Okay let's see what I can help with.    Some Djinn are red because they have been put on standby. You can select those Djinn to set them or use them in battle to summon. If you have all 8 party members, you should have the boat. Go to the world map and press R to see the map. The boat will be highlighted I don't know how you got this far with Lvl. 14 characters but kudos. Your next destination is either Magma Rock, the town of Loho, or the town of Prox to the North. Do you have Blaze as a Psynergy? If not go to Magma Rock and get it as well as the Magma Ball. If you do have those, go to Loho. If there is no cannon in Loho, head north. I'm not entirely sure why you do not have Spring and Shade. My guess would be that you do, but have them equipped to your party in the back row (unless you already checked there) My advice, if you want to continue this file, is to do some grinding to level Felix, Jenna, Sheba, and Piers. Also talk to people. It sometimes helps you to figure where you are going. The wiki is a good resource for more general info you might be looking for   Hope this helps. If you have any other questions or need clarification specifically on my number 4, feel free to ask."
GoldenSun,1kea3h,Kamina_joe,1 point,Thu Aug 15 04:16:11 2013 UTC,"Thank you so much! Just checked the map. The farthest location west on my map is Gondowan Cliffs, the furthest north is Shrine of the Sea God. Do the dot colors on the map mean anything? The Shrine is blue and so is Air's Rock. I don't have any of the locations on the map that you listed. There's also no boat. Maybe I used action replay a long time ago and didn't know? I don't have blaze or magma ball. And I doubled checked my Djinn, no shade or spring."
GoldenSun,1kea3h,Kamina_joe,3,Thu Aug 15 04:36:54 2013 UTC,"Oh wow you are correct in assuming you used an Action Replay as that would be the only way to get all those characters so early in the game. It would also explain the lack of Spring and Shade. It would be very difficult to tell what exactly your next goal is, but you are fairly early in the game. I would recommend maybe just starting over, or if you don't want to do that, just exploring the different points on the map until you figure out what to do next.  The blue dots, if I remember correctly, signify a temple or dungeon of some type."
GoldenSun,1kea3h,CakesXD,2,Thu Aug 15 04:47:06 2013 UTC,"I'm definitely going to assume an Action Replay was involved. The levels of the party have an enormous difference that shouldn't be that big.  Also he said Piers was still in jail, yet he is in his party, haha."

I guess that's why Dark Dawn's soundtrack made me feel so disappointed: it wasn't just completely forgettable and contained so few songs (and Mountain Roc Rising is probably one of the worst songs ever in the history of games), but after coming from the majesty of GS and TLA was just a massive kick in the teeth.   Sakuraba's soundtracks are either freaking fantastic (Baten Kaitos, Golden Sun, Eternal Sonata) or pleasant but unremarkable, generic RPG soundtracks except for the occasional standout song (the majority of the Tales and Star Ocean games).  This was one of the latter."

I believe they're talking about Rolemaster  Oh, and to the OP, consider implementing itemized psyenergy, like how the original games use douse/frost/catch/etc etc. That could be one way to tie character progression to finite growth, while still using the source lore."

In Dark Dawn everyone talked as if it were the olden Shakespearean days while in Golden Sun and Golden Sun TLA the way they talked was more modern. That really messed with the flow of things for me because it became pretty apparant that the new writers weren't really paying attention to the first two games. The game felt like it was written by strangers to the game. Like Camelot said ""Oh crap, we need some writers for this new game that's in demand. Can you guys do it?"" ""Sure, what's the game like?"" ""Well, there isn't much technology and everyone is in little villages blah blah blah but they have super powers, here are the characters."" ""Oh, so like the olden days? Cool."""
GoldenSun,1gxx78,wjdqhdms123,2,Mon Jun 24 09:59:44 2013 UTC,what were some hints that garet liked mia?
GoldenSun,1gxx78,Talooka,1 point,Wed Jul 3 03:10:13 2013 UTC,"I can't think of any off the top of my head as I haven't played the game in a couple of years. I'll try to find some around google and I'll come back and edit this post.  However, I do remember them hinting at it in the game. In the first Golden Sun they made made it seem like Garet liked Jenna, always fretting about her and such, and he was kind of annoyed by Mia. But in Golden Sun: The Lost Age things changed after we reunite with the heroes. Early in TLA it's shown that Jenna likes Isaac and Felix likes Sheba. When they reunite with the heroes from the first GS it looks like Garet and Mia are a lot closer now and there are too many coincidences between Garet and Mia (if I recall correctly). I think there's also a scene in Golden Sun 1 or 2 where you go back to vale and someone in Garet's family calls Mia cute or something or somehow references Garet's interest in Mia. God dangit. I can't remember. I'll go look now."

GoldenSun,1gxx78,AndrewPH,3,Mon Jun 24 19:15:12 2013 UTC,"It had points of no return, and those alone sortof killed it for me. The ability to go back to any point in the game, with few exceptions (collosso comes to mind) made 100%ing the game incredibly satisfying and not frustrating."
GoldenSun,1gxx78,Talooka,0,Tue Jul 16 05:35:52 2013 UTC,"Nah, it was really the writing that killed it for me. It didn't feel like it was going in the right direction on the timeline."
GoldenSun,1gxx78,tuzion,0,Mon Jun 24 23:56:59 2013 UTC,"Oh yeah, writing was awful, but the first two weren't exactly great. We were just the right age for it back then."
GoldenSun,1gxx78,Talooka,1 point,Mon Jun 24 23:58:08 2013 UTC,"It's not the childish factor in Dark Dawn that really upset me its that it seems less mature (by not letting the characters end up together even though they strongly hinted at it in the earlier series [Isaac x Jenna; Garet x Mia; Felix x Sheba]) when they SHOULD have grown with their audience in the first place, and the way that everyone spoke in the second one, their tone of speaking, it was too ancient, and didn't really flow since the previous games had a more modern way of speaking, except for Alex and Mia, but eventually (in TLA) mia spoke modernly too!   Sigh  Sorry for the ramble.."
GoldenSun,1gxx78,xxHikari,5,Tue Jun 25 08:44:01 2013 UTC,"Come into these games with an open mind-no preconceived notions of what a game ""should be"". They are what defined wonderful RPGs to me, and they can do that for you possibly. Play it like you were a child. Trust me."
GoldenSun,1gxx78,xxHikari,3,Mon Jun 24 04:11:36 2013 UTC,I'll admit that at first I thought the game felt like a really generic RPG. But the Djinn system is really unique and it's interesting how puzzle-based the dungeons and areas are. I've been playing Oracle of Seasons a lot lately and it feels kind of similar in that regard. So I'm warming up to it a lot.  also mind reading is cool. psynergy is cool. more RPGs should let you use your magic out of battle it's a way underused mechanic.
GoldenSun,1gxx78,raginmund,3,Mon Jun 24 14:43:06 2013 UTC,"Agreed man, and yeah the puzzles were my favorite part. I really love the log-rolling puzzle in Kohlima forest etc etc. The music is absolute gold, too."
GoldenSun,1gxx78,IsaacIvan,5,Mon Jun 24 22:04:23 2013 UTC,The music. You will remember the music.
GoldenSun,1gxx78,iammrblaze,2,Mon Jun 24 20:27:51 2013 UTC,"I agree. Even through the considerable limitations of the GBA, the music was incredible. I've remixed some pieces and I keep them on my iPod."

GoldenSun,1g9dto,pogeymanz,4,Thu Jun 13 10:39:00 2013 UTC,"For djinni, it's personal preference and there's not much more to say past that. Make sure you have enough healers and pay attention to stats like hp and pp when moving djinn around, since (at least as early in the game as you are) many of the hybrid-ized elemental classes won't have the particular psynergy they need to be most effective and some of their base stats are weak.  In short, djinn set-ups are personal preference to a point. As long as you pack enough power to defeat enemies, heal, and have utility psynergy (like whirlwind), you can play any set-up. The hybrid classes get more interesting at later levels, so be sure to play around with it further in the game.  As for Garet, he's slow as all hell, but he's pretty tanky. I ended up dumping all the cursed gear i had on him late in the game, since his slow speed means in most battles he won't have the chance to hurt himself. There's an item you can get late in the game to remove the effects of curses on weapons AND ARMOR, so stick with normal gear until then and ignore his abysmal speed and pp pool.   Edit: Cleric's ring removes effects of curse on weapons AND ARMOR, which I had forgotten to add. Note that you can't remove the gear with Cleric's Ring on, just as you couldn't with it off. You just don't freeze or self-damage in battle due to curse effects."
GoldenSun,1g9dto,radios_appear,3,Thu Jun 13 13:25:19 2013 UTC,What would we do without the cleric's ring?
GoldenSun,1g9dto,Androidconundrum,2,Thu Jun 13 18:55:43 2013 UTC,"Paladin/ninja/samurai are all pretty good IIRC.  Barbarians have pretty high attack.  In general it doesn't matter what classes you use for GS1 as there isn't anything you can't kill fairly easily (even without summon rushing).  I guess the same is true in the other games as well, though Dullahan will be obnoxious."
GoldenSun,1g9dto,Implacable_Porifera,1 point,Fri Jun 14 01:30:40 2013 UTC,"In the first GS I dont think there is any classes better than the base classes due to the fact that you can only get 7 of each type of djinni (as opposed to 9). If you really want to mix things up, i found it fun simply to give all fire to isaac, earth to garet, water to ivan, wind to mia. I believe you dont get any AoE healing that way though. As i said before though, besides the base classes most classes have really bad scaling until the highest rank(9 djinni needed) this makes you weaker. IF you want to be the strongest you can be then stick to the main classes. I personally only change classes to make the game harder (this only applies to the first game, TLA has better classes) And yes, early game garet does suck as he has balanced stats besides his agility which is low. He was meant to be a tank. I only really found him useful for the hardest boss fights as he never dies. You can get equips to make him a fast damage dealer later on if you want. They arent too hard to get. Have fun :D"
GoldenSun,1g9dto,UltimaSkillz,2,Thu Jun 13 13:21:55 2013 UTC,"Agree.  The lack of djinni in GS1 severely limits how strong your impure classes can be.  You'll just be sacrificing a lot of stats for some pretty shitty new psynergy if you trade djinni.  Giving away venus djinni from Isaac generally means you're missing out on revive, and trading away mercury djinni makes you lose ply/wish if i remember correctly.  Though I believe you can get garet to be pretty fast with some combination of mars/mercury.  And yeah, if his speed really matters that much just give him some ninja items from the tolbi fountain thing."
GoldenSun,1g9dto,synapsii,2,Thu Jun 13 14:18:14 2013 UTC,"Well, that's disappointing. The reason I was excited about playing this game again was so that I can mix and match classes. (I love Final Fantasy Tactics, FF5, even Pokemon, for that reason).  I guess I'll just try to enjoy the game play for this one and then continue with TLA."
GoldenSun,1g9dto,CakesXD,1 point,Thu Jun 13 14:21:15 2013 UTC,"Garet really doesn't shine at all in his natural element, unfortunately. He's really slow, so get those Agility-boosting items for him and he'll be fine.  Throughout the game, I'd usually keep everyone with their respective elements, but by the end of GS1, I had this set-up.  Issac: 3 Mars, 4 Jupiter (Ninja)  Garet: 4 Venus, 3 Jupiter (Samurai)  Ivan: 3 Venus, 4 Mercury (White Mage)  Mia: 3 Mercury, 4 Mars (Ascetic)  Mia will be a little weak, but this set-up works fine if you need two AoE healers."
GoldenSun,1g9dto,CakesXD,2,Thu Jun 13 20:48:24 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking that Samurai and Ninja look like pretty good classes. Too bad that before you get those classes, keeping the natural elements seems like the best overall strategy.  How are the Medium and Ranger classes for Mia and Ivan?"
GoldenSun,1fzf8j,CropUpAnywhere,6,Sun Jun 9 15:14:08 2013 UTC,"I think there would be a much better chance if GS:DD wasn't such a flop.  Sure it'd definitely work, but there really just isn't a big enough fanbase.  If anything, I'd guess it'd be Matthew."
GoldenSun,1fzf8j,synapsii,6,Mon Jun 10 14:19:14 2013 UTC,"I think there's a real possibility of it happening. Isaac is a fairly well requested character, he was an Assist Trophy in Brawl (so they already have a model to build off).  But also, the fact that it's on the 3DS as well as the Wii U might mean they might want to get some more handheld reps in there.  There's also the fact that with the Wii U getting GBA games on it's VC, it could potentially get Golden Sun, and Isaac in Smash would be a great way to promote that."
GoldenSun,1fzf8j,Nitrogen467,3,Mon Jun 24 08:19:42 2013 UTC,Felix would be so bad ass.
GoldenSun,1fzf8j,felixnigh7,4,Tue Jun 18 05:53:00 2013 UTC,"I'd say its about a 0.0000000001% chance.  But don't get me wrong, I'd love it"
GoldenSun,1fzf8j,sufjan_stevens,8,Mon Jun 10 13:34:52 2013 UTC,"Well Isaac did appear as an assist trophy in Brawl so maybe not so out there. Plus, the characters would actually be quite suitable to Smash Bros. fighting style. As CropUpAnywhere mentioned, Psynergy moves for the 4 special attacks. They could wield their weapons similar to Link and the Fire Emblem characters for standard attacks. For a final smash, well take your pick as to what summon it should be, personally I would take Judgement."

GoldenSun,1fbj0e,MenardiOfProx,12,Thu May 30 05:16:31 2013 UTC,"I hope they do, and include the option to send over our Lost Ages save games.  Then i woke up"
GoldenSun,1fbj0e,sufjan_stevens,4,Thu May 30 08:30:30 2013 UTC,"Provably. The series has a cult following, so we'll provably see a sequel someday.  But Camelot Software Planning were working on Mario Tennis Open, and are now working on the soon to be released Mario Golf: World Tour. So that provably means they are not working on it right now...then again, I have no idea about the internal structure of Camelot, they may well have more than one team working on more than one project.  This article from GoNintendo might interest you though.  Camelot says request another Golden Sun if you want one to happen   A big reason for us making RPGs comes from the requests from all the people who have enjoyed our RPGs in the past. Perhaps if there are enough Nintendo users asking for another game in the Golden Sun series, then this will naturally lead to the development of such a game."
GoldenSun,1fbj0e,VitorCarvalho,2,Thu May 30 07:35:56 2013 UTC,I don't think having a cult following is necessarily a large factor in sequels.
GoldenSun,1fbj0e,PikKirby,3,Fri May 31 03:36:58 2013 UTC,"Having a cult following means that there is a group of people which are really invested into something and are likely to buy whatever new stuff comes out in regards to that something. In Golden Sun's case, despite the cult following being a small group of people, it's a group of people which is pretty much guaranteed to buy a new game if one were to come out.  And Guarantee sales should have a lot of weight in the decision of making a sequel. You can see that by them asking people to ask for the game if they want to see it happen. They want to know this cult following is still alive, they want to know we're here to buy the game."
GoldenSun,1fbj0e,VitorCarvalho,5,Fri May 31 06:51:54 2013 UTC,"Going to be honest and say I hope so but I hope its different to the 3rd game. I don't know why but that game has just never captivated me, I've tried playing it a few times but can't really get into it.

GoldenSun,1fbj0e,muffinsformen,5,Thu May 30 11:29:05 2013 UTC,"Dark dawn is pretty much just, ""Hey! You guys remember the first two games?"". It's enjoyable but not as good as the gba titles."

GoldenSun,1fbj0e,muffinsformen,3,Thu May 30 15:26:53 2013 UTC,"These are some of the many problems I had with it, what I especially hated though was the summation of the previous two games near the beginning, it kind of seemed a little insulting to the previous two games to so belittle the actual story..."

GoldenSun,1fbj0e,Brodellsky,6,Thu May 30 17:59:46 2013 UTC,I would rather see Golden Sun and The Lost Age combined into the one complete game they were intended to be (but couldn't because of limitations on the GBA) and remade for the 3DS.    The very thought of that sends chills down my spine.  Remember when they announced Dark Dawn at E3 straight outta fucking nowhere?  Imagine if this year's E3 did that again.
GoldenSun,1fbj0e,PresidentRaggy,5,Tue Jun 4 20:30:48 2013 UTC,"Man, I really hope so. I hope it doesn't take so damn long, though. They lost some of their audience, and probably some of their own recollection of the plot..."
GoldenSun,1fbj0e,Coostabo,4,Thu May 30 14:35:31 2013 UTC,I hope so. As for the quality of the game I'm honestly not hoping for too much though. I just want them to end it once and for all. That cliffhanger is very frustrating...

GoldenSun,183jy7,Kamina_joe,7,Fri Feb 8 06:01:19 2013 UTC,"If Mia has no usable psynergy outside of battle, you may have a djinn on her that is changing her class. Check that first and then try using Ply as others have said."
GoldenSun,183jy7,Nihlux,5,Fri Feb 8 03:51:49 2013 UTC,"Right, I'm not sure if you mean the small statue at the end of the lighthouse or when you're activating the water rings but anyway, you need to use ply on them.  Face the statue , Go to Psynergy, Go to Mia, Hover over Ply, Press A,  Now that should work. If it doesn't work,  Face the statue, Go to Psynergy, Go to Mia, Press L, Press A over Ply, Press B twice, Then press L  And that should cast the psynergy over the statue hitting the trigger. Here's some youtube links that show you how to get through the...  First statue, Last statue."

GoldenSun,17sc6x,BlinkDaggerOP,3,Sun Feb 3 02:39:10 2013 UTC,"I think they just took it and turned it into a kid's game, making the story incredibly linear, puzzles extremely easy, and even boss fights a joke.  I never once had a character even come CLOSE to fainting in GSDD.  Where are the obnoxious but rewarding puzzles?  Where are the WTF boss battles?  Also, the fact that you could permanently miss some Djinn / Summons pissed me off to no end."
GoldenSun,17sc6x,synapsii,7,Sun Feb 3 03:57:01 2013 UTC,"While I did enjoy Dark Dawn, I agree that it was not to the same caliber as the original games. Perhaps it was because I am older now, but Dark Dawn did not have the wonder I experienced as 12 year old playing Goldensun for the first time. I believe an issue with Dark Dawn was how linear it was; and the consistent roadblocks preventing exploration of earlier areas of the game. Miss a Djinn? Too bad. I also agree with your points regarding the story and emotions. Finally, my biggest gripe with DD was simply that it felt like the entire game was leading up to something that never happened, leaving us with a cliffhanger and no promise that any questions will ever be answered."

GoldenSun,17sc6x,GoodGrades,1 point,Wed Feb 27 05:27:33 2013 UTC,"No, it's not about age. I played the original two Golden Sun games somewhat recently and they were still great. They are timeless adventures. Dark Dawn is just a terrible game."
GoldenSun,17sc6x,UnlimitedMind42,2,Sun Jul 28 06:39:54 2013 UTC,"To be honest, Dark Dawn was so awful I didn't even finish it. The entire thing felt like a tutorial, I thought maybe the new psynergy mechanics might be interesting, but it felt like every time you used it, it told you how to do it and still did half of it for you. It was turned into a game for toddlers, with no challenge and way too clear of a way to solve every puzzle. I cried on the inside at how bad my favorite game series had become."
GoldenSun,17sc6x,Hodou,2,Wed Feb 20 00:44:51 2013 UTC,"""The biggest problem with Dark Dawn is, plan and simply, that is has no heart.""  I'm not disagreeing with you, but I have a general rule that whenever I find myself saying this about a game, I take a big step back and take time to consider if I'm just being nostalgic. ""Heart"" is not a very well-defined quality for a game to have, and oftentimes for me it simply means I have fond memories of it.  And sometimes it's true that one game is better than the other. I felt this way about Tales of Symphonia vs. The Abyss, and on examination Symphonia actually had a lot more depth to its party setup and more interesting combat IMO so I felt the preference was justified. But oftentimes, it's just nostalgia talking.  At least that's my two cents. I haven't played Dark Dawn at all."
GoldenSun,17sc6x,Implacable_Porifera,0,Mon Jun 24 01:11:27 2013 UTC,I upvoted you
GoldenSun,17sc6x,snappypants,2,Sat Jul 27 23:17:02 2013 UTC,"One of my biggest gripes was the dialogue.  It was never GS's strong suit (apart from a few choice quotes), but DD took it to low; every time something happens, ever. single. character. talks.  The original suffered from this occasionally, but wasn't nearly as bad because it contained, at most, 4 people.  In TLA it doesn't even happen that much (barring some of the more important events, and then the words are more than variations on ""yes"", ""oh no"", ""@!#&"").  I also really don't like the points of no return, being able to go back was something I enjoyed about the first two.  I guess you could call the split between games a PONR, but they at least had ways for you to get some of the djinn you might have missed.  I was ok with them having dark (and presumably light as well) adepts, but I really hope that their motivation ends up being something other than ""herp derp, I'm evil"".  I really wish they'd only given us 4 party members in DD and introduced the rest in a part II.  It feels like we know nothing about any of the characters because they get so little screen time (poor Himi is just shoe-horned in at the end), and most of them feel like they're just there for their ""special"" psynergy(oh hey, I just used all 3 ""there""s in one sentence).  Overall, it just felt mediocre.  Some of the level designs were nice, i guess.  EDIT: holy necroposting, batman (i thought it said 5 days ago)"

GoldenSun,16vggv,Shackled_Form,3,Sat Jan 19 12:42:52 2013 UTC,"It's a totally different world, for sure. You see just enough of the old characters and a few old parts of the map for it to feel familiar, but it's almost a new universe. Style of fighting and Psynergy are essentially the same. There aren't many plot lines that tie in.  All that said, I enjoyed playing it. It made me remember how much fun I had with the first two games, and I loved being in Weyard again! Some parts felt rushed, some characters not flushed out. It's not a perfect sequel, and it's a bit easy. But it's Golden Sun, and I'm glad I bought it."
GoldenSun,16vggv,PresidentRaggy,2,Mon Feb 4 05:28:44 2013 UTC,I think that many DD players had set their expectations too high when it came out and therefore many (such as myself) were really disappointed with the game. After throwing it away in rage for half a year I picked it up again some time ago and I must admit that the game isn't too bad. It's definitely worth playing if you're an old fan. Just keep in mind that it is not GS or GS:TLA.

GoldenSun,12tfj8,PneumothoraxSC2,3,Thu Nov 8 16:41:57 2012 UTC,"Rather than limiting yourself, how about switching things up a bit? As far as the game allows, give every character the ""wrong"" element of Djinns. Fire adepts go all Wind, Earth gets Water, and so on. Could be fun."

GoldenSun,12rpjm,crooks4hire,1 point,Wed Nov 7 15:24:50 2012 UTC,They keychains are pretty sturdy and made by some kind of thick polymer. The edges can be sharp though but most likely because they were just cut and then shipped to me

GoldenSun,10z6w2,ChadGarion25,1 point,Fri Oct 5 19:24:52 2012 UTC,Agreed. I enjoyed the game but it was much easier than the previous two. Dark Dawn required little training and you could essentially playthrough it easily without getting stuck anywhere.  The first two caused you to rack your brain to figure out a problem that was in your way and if you went somewhere without adequately training you would be in for a bad time.
GoldenSun,10vu80,ChadGarion25,6,Wed Oct 3 17:15:44 2012 UTC,Wow.  Just wow.
GoldenSun,10vu80,Weebos,4,Wed Oct 3 18:54:28 2012 UTC,"I know right!?! My siblings and I will occasionally look up Video Game OST from our childhood on YouTube and play it for the other siblings to guess. I guessed Golden Sun, so I lost that round thanks to Camelot and their inspiring tracks."
GoldenSun,10vu80,PneumothoraxSC2,4,Wed Oct 3 19:04:00 2012 UTC,"Wow. I've played Mario Tennis so much, but I've never even thought of making this connection. You sir, are on the ball."
GoldenSun,10vu80,Dracobolt,6,Wed Oct 3 20:36:41 2012 UTC,"If I were to blindfold you and put this music on, telling you that it was an unused sound track from a canceled Golden Sun 64 prequel, you might just believe it was true."
GoldenSun,10u0nt,Athene_Wins,6,Tue Oct 2 19:57:49 2012 UTC,"From what I've heard there is nothing currently in development, however the developers will consider another sequel if there is considerable demand for one."
GoldenSun,10u0nt,Spewis,2,Tue Oct 2 22:36:08 2012 UTC,Thanks. Not sure if I even trust them with a 4th. The 3rd one sucked
GoldenSun,10u0nt,PneumothoraxSC2,5,Tue Oct 2 22:59:33 2012 UTC,"+1, puzzles weren't challenging, game was short, little-to-no replayability factor. Also seemed aimed at younger audience with regards to the 'childishness' of dialogue. Would like to have a 4th, but they'd need to completely change it from the 3rd."
GoldenSun,10u0nt,ChuchuCannon,3,Wed Oct 3 01:19:15 2012 UTC,"I think the problem is they went backwards. The games should've grown with the players. I dunno about everyone else, but i was pretty young when i played golden sun. Maybe 12-ish. And it was a pretty good kid's game, for someone who spent most of his childhood playing nes games.   But when dark dawn came out it was STILL just that: a kids game. It should've gone the Legend of Korra route and had more mature things for their (now) more mature audience"
GoldenSun,10u0nt,totalanonymity,2,Mon Oct 29 06:14:06 2012 UTC,"You know, I was pretty young myself when it came out (around the same age, too) and it actually felt like a bit more mature than the audience I would have been in (albeit not much, but a bit more involved and with depth). Having grown up some more now, DD felt very childish and seemed to represent what most of Nintendo seems to target these days with their DS/3DS games. But, I replayed the series before DD's release and they didn't feel quite as much of a kid's game. DD definitely felt like one. Maybe I'm just still head over heels in love with GS and TLA."
GoldenSun,10u0nt,UnlimitedMind42,1 point,Wed Nov 7 22:14:02 2012 UTC,They should remake the third and pretend the original third never even happened. AND make it for the GBA.
GoldenSun,10u0nt,snappypants,6,Wed Feb 20 00:49:25 2013 UTC,"I wouldn't say it sucked, the combat and UI was great, and the artwork was good. The story though... well... =\  Still kept me playing non-stop 'till I beat it though!"
GoldenSun,10u0nt,Ruwn,5,Wed Oct 3 02:08:58 2012 UTC,Quality of dialog also took a hit. The target audience grew up but the characters became younger.... why...
GoldenSun,10u0nt,metaclypse,1 point,Wed Oct 3 03:07:44 2012 UTC,"Maybe they figured, that not everyone who played the previous parts will actially buy the game, so they'd make the characters appeal to a younger audience. As far as I know, Dark Dawn did not sell as good as its predecessors, so it seems they would be right with their assumption. That is, by the way, also the main reason why I personally don't think that they will make a 4th Golden Sun."
GoldenSun,10u0nt,Ruwn,1 point,Wed Oct 3 19:39:20 2012 UTC,"Yeah but now they've got a few new fans and a lot of jaded older fans. I too doubt we'll ever see a 4th. If the game had done well at least critically, we'd have some hope."
GoldenSun,10u0nt,UnlimitedMind42,1 point,Wed Oct 3 19:58:48 2012 UTC,It didn't sell as well as the original two because of how awful it was. The now older audience of the first two are even less likely to buy the toddler oriented third.
GoldenSun,10u0nt,Lukar115,3,Wed Feb 20 00:52:56 2013 UTC,"The djinn ui was pretty sweet, ill give them that"
GoldenSun,10u0nt,AlchemicLight,1 point,Wed Oct 3 02:16:20 2012 UTC,"I don't think it sucked, per say, it was just... samey. There wasn't really anything in the game that wasn't done [better] in the previous games. The game looked great, but it was way too easy, the story was a bit of a joke (I still laugh when I think back and remember that it was essentially one big sidequest), and it didn't really bring anything new to the table.  I believe that Camelot can make a great fourth game if they just don't half-ass it. They should add in multiple difficulty settings, new ways to interact with the environment, new battle features, etc."

GoldenSun,10g0yy,SomberChaos,1 point,Tue Sep 25 14:56:19 2012 UTC,I would love a whole set. One of the small additions they made in Dark Dawn that I really liked was giving each unique Djinn a different appearance. you can make them magnetic and stick them to a player like that one image in the instruction booklet.

I feel like it could be submitted to Nintendo/Camelot to light their fire with regards to a fourth game to tie up the loose ends from Dark Dawn.
GoldenSun,z13n2,AlchemicLight,2,Sat Sep 8 14:40:19 2012 UTC,"Pretty sure Camelot already has a questionnaire, i remember doing one on their official website sometime ago, so hopefully it's still there."

GoldenSun,yxfcj,GohnGalt,2,Mon Aug 27 22:35:40 2012 UTC,"I'm not that smart of a gamer, unfortunately. D: I didn't strategize my weapon and equipment assignments mostly because I could handle all the battles with little problem. I set the djinn to the character of their own element and gave the equipment I could to everyone. My favorite characters were a priority."
GoldenSun,yxfcj,patsydragon,2,Tue Aug 28 03:45:20 2012 UTC,"I remember in Lost age, there was a way to guarantee getting rare drops, which basically broke the game.  The other thing that broke Lost Age for me was equpping FElix with the Sol blade, then giving him the rigth combo of Armor so that Meggido unleased 90% of the time... With the power of a summon every turn basically, the doom dragon was a cinch. I beat him without having ot revive anyone or use summons. Just spammed attack and Wish. (This was at around level 50 for my main party).  As for everyone else, My main pretty much got most of the action, so they were always much much much stronger than my backup, by about 6-7 levels. Also, Jenna was a much worse healer than Mia.  As for items, I kinda maxed everyone's stats through armor out, at least without the use of traded items and the such... I felt super unhappy when I never got to challenge Dulhallan in my main game."
GoldenSun,yxfcj,chimpfunkz,2,Fri Aug 31 06:24:33 2012 UTC,The best part of the second game for me is the additional classes and psynergies to play around with when getting bored.
GoldenSun,yxfcj,chimpfunkz,2,Sat Sep 1 20:58:32 2012 UTC,"Yeah. I love some of the new psyenergies like call dulhallan, but being able to have the sol blade unleash pretty much every turn is really OP..."

GoldenSun,yxfcj,Samoman21,1 point,Mon Jan 21 23:55:26 2013 UTC,"Mia can get Pure Wish, which has a base heal of 400. Cool Aura, which has a base heal of 200. Therefore, Mia is much more effective than Jenna for healing."
GoldenSun,yxfcj,chimpfunkz,0,Tue Jan 22 01:02:09 2013 UTC,what level does Mia get pure wish?
GoldenSun,yxfcj,Samoman21,2,Tue Jan 22 01:51:30 2013 UTC,"46? Something in the high 40's. However this is for a straight mercury build.  I'm pretty sure there are ways to give her Pure wish at a lower level, but I really don't know off the top of my head."

GoldenSun,yw42v,jediassassin37,1 point,Mon Aug 27 21:42:38 2012 UTC,It's kind of funny because in GS3 Garet references how Isaac was a great leader.

GoldenSun,yqqzc,radios_appear,2,Mon Aug 27 05:35:19 2012 UTC,"I read it as more as an insight into the thought processes of the members of the team and less as a story.   Skimming through it again and remembering parts, the author did a great job with interactions of characters during the non-action travel sequences that wouldn't be included in the game. Or an maintaining exercises in stock moral decisions that the characters would face, from their perspective in-universe (i.e. the consequences associated with mind-reading, or exactly what it means to have as much power as they do)."
GoldenSun,yqqzc,Dracobolt,4,Mon Aug 27 12:27:43 2012 UTC,"LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY FANFICTION  ... Ahem. Yes, well, I'm going to be immodest and suggest my own works to start. You can find most of them here, and my special project, which recently won a Best Fanfic award at the Temple of Kraden, is here. That one is a meaty, in-progress epic that gets better as it goes, so stick with it until at least the second post if you're interested.  Now that I'm done promoting my own works, I'll second The Angel and the Slayer, and recommend the works of Joker's Specter as well. He's especially good at funny fics and making cracky concepts work. Dantaron's a good writer as well."

Although it is easier to pirate a DS game now than it was to pirate GBA games way back then (this might not be correct, but since the internet was less prevalent, fewer people would have been buying flashcarts).  Certainly I don't think it would have made 600,000-1,100,000 copies worth of difference.  Indeed, it would be hard to argue that it made much of an impact at all.  I'll try to find some numbers on how many have pirated it (a look at a few popular torrent sites should give a very rough estimate of at least how popular it was.  EDIT: from what I can see, it wasn't very popular.  Any given torrent for it seems to have very few downloaders (TPB only shows current seeders, not total downloads :frustration:).  I wouldn't even know where to start looking to find direct downloads of it (fat chance we'll ever get to know how many times it went on megaupload)"

With Dark Dawn, we got a bunch of new questions, nothing on the future of the series, and I still care way more about the characters from TLA than Dark Dawn."
GoldenSun,xakk4,Ruwn,3,Mon Jul 30 16:55:30 2012 UTC,"It seemed as though Dark Dawn was made to market to some of the younger crowd that was now enjoying the Nintendo handhelds. Golden Sun and The Lost Age seemed a bit more like they made it simply because they wanted to, drawing whatever audience would like it, and also adding some darker themes throughout. It would have been nice if they had implemented that in Dark Dawn, but it seemed a bit dumbed down, for lack of a better phrase. I felt there was some hand-holding going on; the puzzles were easier, the grinding was easier, the bosses were easier.   I remember dying so much in The Lost Age. In Dark Dawn? No, not really. Maybe a couple times due to user error, but not because it was so difficult. I'd kill for some new content. But, definitely pay homage to the GBA versions.  Let's hope we don't have to wait as long for a Dark Dawn sequel (or prequel to the whole series or whatever spin-off story they decide on) as we did for a game after The Lost Age. That wait was unbearable."
GoldenSun,xakk4,totalanonymity,4,Mon Aug 6 03:16:19 2012 UTC,"What has kept other GS communities active has been fandom content, not just gameplay stuff. Do we allow things like fic posts here?"
GoldenSun,xakk4,Dracobolt,3,Sun Jul 29 04:39:14 2012 UTC,"Yes indeed we do. All golden sun content that is arguably a contribution to the community is welcome, as far as I am concerned"
GoldenSun,xakk4,snappypants,2,Sun Jul 29 05:16:09 2012 UTC,"Fiction, artwork, direct links to forum threads, anything is welcome as long as its loosely related to the series!"
GoldenSun,xakk4,Ajile,3,Sun Jul 29 05:35:39 2012 UTC,"The subreddit is most likely inactive due to lack of content. The last game came out over a year, there has been no news of the next, and there us very little fan content. It's stagnant."
GoldenSun,xakk4,Ajile,4,Sat Jul 28 17:00:07 2012 UTC,"That's true. Perhaps we should find a way to generate content then. Starman.net is still popular, and the last mother game came out years ago. Perhaps we should take a tip from them?"
GoldenSun,xakk4,Dwemer23,3,Sat Jul 28 23:06:56 2012 UTC,"Golden Sun never got as large of a following as Mother, so it'd be hard to emulate something like that. The best thing I could see being done is just trying to create a stronger community. Hold discussion posts, get people involved while still keeping it within the frame of the topic."
GoldenSun,xakk4,snappypants,5,Sun Jul 29 05:41:38 2012 UTC,"That's a good point. I suppose we'll have to compensate somehow for the lack of a fanbase somehow (or at least, lack of a large one)"
GoldenSun,xakk4,Dwemer23,3,Sun Jul 29 08:41:38 2012 UTC,"This is perhaps a silly request, but would it be possible for you to add the four Djinn types as flair for this subreddit? I see their icons already at the bottom of each page here, but I feel it would give some character to the posters here and make the place look more official and community RP-oriented, etc. which seems appropriate for fans of this RPG."
GoldenSun,xakk4,snappypants,3,Sun Jul 29 06:55:59 2012 UTC,"Ooh that's an excellent idea! I'll add the flair as soon as I get back to my computer, so probably tomorrow morning :)"

GoldenSun,xa2ea,Ruwn,9,Sat Jan 19 20:09:44 2013 UTC,"If we're being perfectly honest, it was crap compared to the first two. I just hope they don't wait another 7 years for a sequel, as by that time the target audience will have moved on. Actually, my biggest fear is that this is already the case and we will never get resolution."
GoldenSun,xa2ea,yalue,3,Sat Jul 28 04:18:45 2012 UTC,I thought the game was actually very good right up until the world was plunged into the shadow... up until there it had a good mix of a main quest coupled with interesting and fun side quests that the characters seemingly fell into to get items to progress further.  Once the world became plunged in shadow the story just rushed to the end...
GoldenSun,xa2ea,ChuchuCannon,3,Mon Jul 30 08:35:20 2012 UTC,Ugh.  I hope they de-canonize it and make a completely different sequel.
GoldenSun,xa2ea,Jigglypuffisabro,2,Thu Aug 9 15:18:08 2012 UTC,"Well, if the cancellation of Megaman Legends 3 has proven anything, then it's that fans just have to show their support. We won't get much explanation at all if a fourth game isn't made! xP"
GoldenSun,wlt51,Spewis,3,Sun Jul 15 19:54:47 2012 UTC,The events that count in the transfer include all the ones you listed (except the drowning tree) and also the fight with deadbeard.    Also make sure you have at least 6/7 of all types of djinn in the first game to unlock the secret dungeon at the end of TLA that requires you to have all 72 djinn (TLA allows you to pick up one djinn of each element from the previous game that you might have missed).  You can also update your file any time before jupiter lighthouse.
GoldenSun,wlt51,Spewis,3,Thu Jul 26 07:44:22 2012 UTC,"Alright thanks. I wish I'd known about the update feature. I had everything complete except for talking to the mayor of Vault, and I had made it in to Madra for the first time. After hearing about the golden boots, I hopped onto the first game, ran all the way from venus lighthouse back to Vault to talk to the mayor and fought the final boss again. I then restarted The Lost Age, and to be honest, it was totally worth it."

GoldenSun,uwjiw,NeverScoop,2,Mon Jun 11 21:46:36 2012 UTC,After what they did with dark dawn I honestly want the sun to stay set. I am perfectly fine with forgetting about dark dawn and replaying the first two over and over again. Being a fan is one thing but you have to admit when the series has taken a turn.
GoldenSun,uwjiw,safechain,2,Fri Aug 10 13:48:21 2012 UTC,I'm sorry but did people actually like Dark Dawn?  I play Golden sun 1 and 2 over and over as they are brilliant but Dark Dawn?

GoldenSun,ndifj,AntiBellum,2,Fri Dec 23 12:30:52 2011 UTC,"I was wondering this the other day as well. In addition to these other arguments, I can't see the Golden Sun team passing up the opportunity to use the 3D in puzzle-creation, as well as more in-depth and cool looking environments."

GoldenSun,h0pz8,InvisiblePants,2,Sat Apr 30 07:27:02 2011 UTC,"I found the game quite enjoyable. It is the first physical game I purchased in a long time (Spent way too much time playing Heroes of Newerth and League of legends) and I definitely think it was worth it. I agre it wasn't perfect though, I expected the story to go more in-depth after getting the feather and it was kind of disappointing to be left in a cliffhanger once again, but this time on a console that is most likely near the end of its cycle. Although with E3 around the corner we can only hope for some announcement."
GoldenSun,h0pz8,AzorMX,1 point,Sun Jun 5 19:46:30 2011 UTC,"Here's what I'll be expecting from the sequel.  All in my opinion.  Less moon-like running.  I wasn't really feeling the run.  Final Fantasy III and Nostalgia's running looked better.  Re-do the item menu.  Being able to see all the items a character is holding on the top screen is fine, but I didn't like the one-at-a-time scrolling at the bottom screen.  More difficult puzzles.  Perhaps bringing back all the old puzzle solving psynergies and adding some more will also help.  Slower leveling.  Way too fast!  I also maxed out their levels with the help of the Tua Warriors in the last area.  The leveling speed in the GBA versions were the right way to go.  Stronger weapons.  They already showed the Sol Blade and Excalibur, so they have to best those now.  I'd like to see them outdo Megiddo.  More summons.  Just a handful would be fine.  Maybe adding four more summons where you need five of the same element.  Having someone from Tuaparang join the group.  Add some more variety to the group, you know?  Sveta was a unique addition to the group.  BATTLE ARENA.  I want to endlessly fight monsters that slowly get stronger and battle with my friends.  Maybe have 4v4 or 8v8 battles instead of 3v3.  Anyway, these are the stuff I felt they dropped the ball on or stuff they have to compensate for for showing in this game."
GoldenSun,h0pz8,PhatBoiRL,1 point,Sat Apr 30 08:15:28 2011 UTC,"I agree with most of your comments. The game was way too easy. I was hoping it'd be more like The Lost Age, but it ended up being more like the much more generic first game."
GoldenSun,h0pz8,chilemaniac,1 point,Sat Apr 30 22:23:44 2011 UTC,I agree on the story being lackluster and the puzzles simple.  Another point I remember as being annoying was item management and equipping.   and every fight could be won by repeatedly hitting the A button.   That's true for all golden sun titles to some extent.
GoldenSun,h0pz8,thlrnb,1 point,Wed May 25 18:30:25 2011 UTC,"Honestly, it was pretty disappointing. as soon as I saw Ace's picture in the guide (I like getting the guides for the wonderful art; the puzzles in this were so easy I could solve them blindfolded) I knew it was Alex. there was no subtlety whatsoever.  the plot is okay, but it only makes some of the characters important. and I was upset that they shoved all 8 party members into the same game instead of balancing them out like in the originals.  It's more than a little obvious that Weyward is turning into Earth. all of the locations correspond to real life locations. they even have the Great Wall of China for crying out loud.   MOST IMPORTANTLY what I realized is that they were marketing this to the wrong demographic. they marketed to kids who probably weren't even born when the original games came out. they SHOULD have marketed to older teens and adults who had played and enjoyed the first games. they simplified it rather than making it more challenging. they were trying to make new fans rather than trying to please the old loyal fans; us. and that makes me sad."

GoldenSun,eisz2,theksepyro,2,Tue Dec 14 07:00:18 2010 UTC,"Yeah, that was a bad idea to have areas you can't travel back to.  I got bored and made everyone lv. 99 already.  I tried doing a Matthew solo on the final boss, but his retribution attack always gets me.  Is there an armor that prevents one-hit K.O's?"
GoldenSun,eisz2,snappypants,2,Tue Dec 14 08:35:53 2010 UTC,"I thought it was OK.   I heard the developers describe the first two games as the prequels to this story, so I figured that it would turn out to be a series with a cliff-hanger.  I have no idea how they will do the sequel though, I don't think I've seen a DS game that can be hot-swapped like that to transfer save game data.  When one of the npc's mentioned that Himi had a dream of Issac being in trouble I thought the game would at least go that far. Maybe the Tuaparang attacked the Sanctum so Issac set off to defend it, and Dark Dawn 2 will start off as the kids returning home to that vortex in their village and their parents nowhere to be found.  Cant wait!  (Djinn is the plural by the way, no need to put an 's' after it :P)"
GoldenSun,eisz2,snappypants,1 point,Thu Dec 9 16:48:28 2010 UTC,"Rant alert!  Sorry.  :/  If Dark Dawn 2 starts out with Matthew, then I'd be a little sad because him along with Tyrell and Karis will be low levels again and lose all the items they had in their previous journey.  If the save file after beating the game is a transferable file, then it's not possible for Matthew to be the main character in the sequel, or else Matthew and co. will be far to powerful in the beginning.  Maybe I'm just thinking way too hard about this, but a way for a sequel to work is how it was in The Lost Age: new main characters.  If that's the case, then the main character would have to be a character that was introduced in Dark Dawn who's an adept, but didn't join Matthew.  The people that come to mind who are possible main characters are Issac or Nowell (Reif's sister).  Only these two come to mind.  There's also a chance that Camelot will just introduce a new main character, which I wouldn't appreciate,  imo.  Sorry about the pessimistic ranting.  I never rant unless I care about it, so I guess this is a good thing?  Also, thanks for the heads up about the djinn thing!"
GoldenSun,eisz2,snappypants,3,Thu Dec 9 19:08:33 2010 UTC,"Nowell could be a new main character I suppose, but they would have to get rid of Piers somehow.   They could easily let you play your save game and continue playing as Matthew by just having him start as a lvl 50 character. All my characters were 44 - 49 when I completed the game, and I think the maximum level is like 54.   No Save Game: Start with 7/9 Djinn each and continue on from lvl 50 with a default set of gear to upgrade. Save Game: Import save character data, maybe reset character level to 50, if the cap is higher than 54. Keep all acquired Djinn and items.   There is no reason that it couldn't continue on from where it left off."
GoldenSun,eisz2,Zerfetzte,1 point,Thu Dec 9 19:30:37 2010 UTC,"You brought up a good a point about Piers.  I also beat the game at lv 44, but my Matthew is now 73 (those tua warriors before the final boss give out hecka exp!)  I guess Camelot would also have to make weapons more powerful and epic than the Sol Blade and Excalibur as well.  I'm questioning this too much.  It makes me expect more and I'll get disappointed in the end.  I'll just go ahead and stop.  Thanks got hearing me out, snappypants."
GoldenSun,eisz2,Zerfetzte,2,Fri Dec 10 02:10:39 2010 UTC,"Oh, I didn't realise that they let you level that much!  I guess they could end up throwing us another curve ball and making us play Matthew and the others' kids (that could even be why they mentioned that Nowell fell in love with Piers, for a grandkid).  Hopefully now that they have they have their 3D-DS-RPG engine built they will have a new one ready for us in a year or so. /wishful thinking"

GoldenSun,eisz2,ReaverXai,2,Fri Dec 10 17:21:23 2010 UTC,"Defeated this just last night, actually. I was a little disappointed. I always want more detail although that was mitigated by the obvious sequel hook. I really want to know where Felix is and what he's doing (I do note that someone in Yamata talks about how he could have children by now), see more of the world, and, oh, I really wanted a 'I am your father!' scene with Amiti, although I suppose a  'he is your father' scene would be more likely. And just more information about the world and the Umbra Clan in general.  Part two could start somewhere else entirely and move towards Mount Aleph where Matthew and party join, similar to Lost Age. As for characters... There are three characters still from the first two games who potentially could have children, plus Nowell. The Lost Age characters kind of got the short end of the stick in this one, which is too bad, because I liked them a lot.  I liked the game overall. I just wanted more. I'm sure Camelot will release a sequel... eventually.   Also, is there a love interest between Matthew and Sveta???  I don't think so, and I really hope not, but I'm sure someone ships it. Or, knowing this fandom, a lot of people do.  Oh, also, ETA: I was looking forward to having Matthew and Sveta sacrificing themselves  I  really thought the game would end with Matthew sacrificing himself for Weyard. Camelot got me there."

I've seen a few reviews whining about that.  It doesn't bother me at all to do some reading when I'm not doing puzzles. Then again, I also like visual novels, so maybe I'm not a good judge.   (Well, except all the dialogue before fighting the Doom Dragon. That stops being quite as likeable when you lose a few times and have to go back through the scene)."
GoldenSun,edjd7,Zerfetzte,1 point,Tue Nov 30 00:06:30 2010 UTC,"I loved the longer dialog in the first two games too, especially the intro to the first game, it felt like forever, but the first time I played through it I loved it.  The dialog in Dark Dawn doesn't feel as epic though, there is a LOT of repetition, and a lot of the time you don't have a clue what context your expressed emotion will be taken as. Maybe I'm just not the target audience for the dialog anymore :P /old"
GoldenSun,edjd7,Kavvybop,2,Tue Nov 30 15:43:46 2010 UTC,"I've been playing almost all day yesterday, and have made it just past the clouds (not going to get any more detailed than that). I've found that the UI is much more visually appealing, however the menus can get really confusing. I'm used to the menus from GS and TLA, which is why I still find it hard to navigate. I also find it kind of a pain to go through my items and psynergy because you can only see 3 at a time (with it always focusing on one). It's the same with the equiping. I hardly know who has one because it's so linear.  I also find that the story is super-linear (at least for now). You can't explore because everything is divided. ""Oh the bad guy just blocked the cave now I have to go south, there goes any chance I get at getting back any djinn I may have missed..."" I really dislike how the game is progressing so far in terms of accessibility, and I'm hoping by the end of the game I'll still be able to visit the first few towns I've visited. Also, missable djinni... really?? Not cool. I'm now forced to use a guide if I want them all  Otherwise though, everything about this game is just amazing. I'm liking how the game progresses in terms of storyline, the characters are great (although Tyrell is kind if getting on my nerves), the graphics are just stunning (although I feel everything's too big). Fights are very pleasant to take part in (although when you constantly press ""A"" to fight enemies that zoom gets a little anoying). Overall I'm liking the game since I just adore Golden Sun, and considering I'm still only at the beginning I'm quite excited to see where things go.  EDIT: I just realized that for every ""I like..."" I added an ""(although...)"". I guess my review sounded worse than I meant it to. To clarify, I'm really enjoying this game at the moment."

GoldenSun,edjd7,Sareos,1 point,Tue Nov 30 18:19:44 2010 UTC,"I was just posting this from the top of my head (without the game in front of me), so I realize some things may be a bit off. Like I said my review sounded a lot more critical than I meant it to. The things I've mentioned aren't as bad as it sounded (except for the missable content, however as I'm only 9-10 hours in I'm hoping to see that I can revisit previous towns and reobtain any djinni I missed)."
GoldenSun,edjd7,notoriousRK9,2,Tue Nov 30 21:41:20 2010 UTC,"RE: Summons.  I love the redesign to Boreas. I'll have to agree about many of them not being very impressive, though, but I think something like that is more a matter of personal taste than anything else.  The game does have a much darker tone than the previous ones, too, but it seems the plot goes on so many tangents. And all of the new terms for ancient civilizations and such that weren't used before is a little overwhelming initially.  I could say more, but I haven't finished the story yet. All in all, I'm not disappointed with the game as a whole, but there have been a few disappointments, such as the lower difficulty level.  And while I'm thinking about it, for as much as the people seem to worship Piers, why don't you encounter him again?"
GoldenSun,edjd7,Zerfetzte,1 point,Sun Dec 5 02:05:48 2010 UTC,"i actually like the split screen summons, it provides for further eye candy and the graphics are already pretty nice  also the backgrounds are awesome  PS did anybody else have a WTF moment to the first new Psynergy and what you primarily use it on?"
GoldenSun,ecpgd,snappypants,1 point,Sun Nov 28 02:59:44 2010 UTC,"The main purpose of the very First commercial that came out for GoldenSun was to show Alchemy and how it was changing things.   Dead man watching the opera that's somehow alive. Gargoyle on the wall coming to life. Violins in the Opera changing to bows with fire arrows. Glass from the Crystal Dragon changing to White Flower Pedals once it touched the ground. Woman's dress changed from Red to White.   EDIT:  Also, apparently it was relating to some things in the game according to the wikia for GoldenSun http://goldensun.wikia.com/wiki/Commercials"

GoldenSun,ebsbm,snappypants,2,Thu Nov 25 21:37:41 2010 UTC,It's neat that each one will have their own appearance in DD. 3 more days. I am dying in anticipation.
GoldenSun,eb408,ReaverXai,4,Wed Nov 24 14:34:16 2010 UTC,I just walked half an hour in the rain from my campus to the nearest Gamestop. They told me they won't get it until Wednesday. Same story with all the other shops in the area.

GoldenSun,eb408,Zerfetzte,2,Mon Nov 29 21:42:23 2010 UTC,"I did this exact same thing, except on a bike before class. At least they told me they should have it tomorrow.   If didn't have a preorder I'd see if I could get it somewhere else."
GoldenSun,eb408,snappypants,1 point,Tue Nov 30 00:02:58 2010 UTC,"That sucks =\  There is a Rom of it on torrent sites if you are desperate to play, but it would suck to start over if you get a real cartridge!"
GoldenSun,eb408,snappypants,3,Mon Nov 29 21:44:59 2010 UTC,Tell me about it! Not too long of a wait left.   After about 6 years it seems like it'll only be a few minutes until it's released.
GoldenSun,eb408,sticksman,3,Wed Nov 24 15:34:33 2010 UTC,All 4 of us.
GoldenSun,eb408,bonestalkers,3,Wed Nov 24 18:27:23 2010 UTC,I resent that!  There are at least 8 of us!
GoldenSun,eb408,Zerfetzte,2,Mon Nov 29 15:23:36 2010 UTC,"Aw hell yes. I keep seeing commercials on TV for it. I pre-ordered as soon as I could. I'm gonna cream my panties, I'm so excited. :3"
GoldenSun,eam3n,snappypants,1 point,Tue Nov 23 17:21:31 2010 UTC,I'm just hoping that it has a plot that wasn't shoehorned in.
