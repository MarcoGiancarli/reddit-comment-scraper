wildhockey,3dy5md,MinnieFan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:58:38 2015 UTC,Cheapest he is coming in at is 945K. That's the minimum he can get.
wildhockey,3dy5md,jrmehle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:25:28 2015 UTC,Im okay with that
wildhockey,3dy5md,MinnieFan,3,Tue Jul 21 04:55:41 2015 UTC,I still hope we get Cullen. That'd shift Fontaine to RW4 and Coyle to RW3. Send down Folin and we have about 1.4 million in space depending on Haula's arbitration. That will accrue to more than enough for a deadline addition combined with savings from long-term injuries. And if Backstrom can be LTIR we are more than set.
wildhockey,3dy5md,DaRealHankHill,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:26:55 2015 UTC,The issue with that is the bonus's as Russo stated could put them over the cap. Not a good thing to have. Not to mention it could severely hinder callups along the way too.
wildhockey,3dy5md,bigt252002,3,Mon Jul 20 23:38:32 2015 UTC,"Bonuses certainly would be an issue, but adding Cullen for 1 million would only cost us 100k more than Graovac. And callups likely wouldn't be that big of an issue because of the way the cap is calculated. And if a player they are called up for is out long term we recover cap anyways."
wildhockey,3dy5md,DaRealHankHill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:02:15 2015 UTC,"Even if we don't get Cullen (or anyone else), I just don't see Fontaine keeping that 3rd line RW spot. Even if he has a crazy good camp he might start there but I think he eventually settles in as the 4th line RW. The 3rd line center spot is Graovac's to lose IMO, basically if he's ready, the job is his and Coyle shifts back to wing, and if not Coyle stays at 3C and Graovac goes to Iowa for another year. However, I really think if Graovac doesn't make the team, Schroeder will, and he's not a 4th line player, so if Schroeder is up, that shifts Fontaine to the 4th line. Essentially I think our 2nd and 3rd lines will be either:  Zucker-Koivu-Coyle  Vanek-Graovac-Nino  or:  Zucker-Koivu-Nino  Vanek-Coyle-Schroeder"
wildhockey,3dy5md,dakralter,3,Mon Jul 20 23:55:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sold on Schroeder, but we'll definitely see what Fletcher's plan is depending on what he does with Cullen, Boyes, and Semin still out there and contracts being dirt cheap right now."

wildhockey,3dy5md,Piffles,4,Tue Jul 21 19:14:20 2015 UTC,That was the luckiest Wild team. They weren't all that great but we're extremely lucky to even get to the WCF.

wildhockey,3dy5md,Goon_on_the_Moon,-3,Mon Jul 20 21:14:26 2015 UTC,Ah okay thanks. I'm just wishing we could get rid of him for someone else if he isn't going to produce.
wildhockey,3dy5md,Goon_on_the_Moon,2,Mon Jul 20 21:28:51 2015 UTC,"I, too, used to question whether or not he was worth the money, especially when I see him hanging around in the neutral zone and not making crisp passes all the time. But you should probably check your facts before you say that he isn't producing for the team. I'd start by taking a look at this chart, which is conveniently located on the Wild's home page."
wildhockey,3dy5md,chucktestlacoil,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"True, he was quite valuable when it came to contributing to goals in the regular season, and I actually always liked how he took chances with his passes, which made for unique scoring chances.   But come playoff time he really just got outplayed and his slowness was taken advantage of. He may get a decent amount of points, but he always makes it much easier for the opponent to score (He was -7 +/- in the playoffs which was 2nd worst on the team).  I'm interested to see how this year goes again but I don't think he can play a positive role in the playoffs for the Wild. I would like to see him play fewer less minutes so he isn't so tired at least."

wildhockey,3dmu45,MNEvenflow,3,Fri Jul 17 19:51:44 2015 UTC,"Yea that Bergenheim trade stings a bit. I liked the idea of adding him for depth for the playoff run, but the fact that it took a 3rd to get him and then we went and got Stewart too just made that a bad trade. A 5th or even a 4th for Bergenheim would've been fine, but a 3rd was too steep of a price."
wildhockey,3dmu45,dakralter,3,Sat Jul 18 00:18:55 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not too broken up about it. The chances that a 3rd round pick will make it to the NHL are better than a 4th or 5th round pick, however the percentages drop off dramatically after the 1st round and 2nd round."

wildhockey,3djozk,Stillnotathrowaway,7,Thu Jul 16 20:36:53 2015 UTC,https://www.random.org/lists/   Minnesota Wild  St Louis Blues  Nashville Predators  Chicago Blackhawks  Winnipeg Jets  Dallas Stars  Colorado Avalanche   I'm sure putting these names into that page will give me a better and more accurate result than any result I could predict.
wildhockey,3djozk,Project_Independence,8,Fri Jul 17 06:39:03 2015 UTC,"Hate to say it, but until someone shuts them down in the playoffs, the Hawks come into the season number one. I know they've lost Saad, Sharp, and Oduya, but they got decent returns on their trades and still have some big-time playmakers. They've won three cups in the last six years, they're playoff-built and playoff-tested, and I'm not just saying all these good things because I live in Chicago and don't want to get mugged on my way home from work.  Dallas will be interesting to watch, I don't know how good I'd feel about committing so much money to two different goaltenders but Kari Lehtonen has always struck me as a very average goalie so I guess it was necessary. They've added a ton of pieces both at forward and on the blue line. For them it will be about chemistry; they could shoot right out of the gates but my guess is it will be a slow start. They should make the playoffs, however, based on who they've added.  St. Louis loses Oshie through the trade and I don't know how the roster will react to one more year of Hitchcock. However, you simply can't overlook the acquisition of KYLE BRODZIAK. St. Louis is still a really dangerous team and if Elliott/Allen aren't total sieves in the playoffs, they will be a tough out.  Colorado's playoff berth last year is going to look more and more like an aberration. I don't really know/understand the overall vision of how this team is being built but I do enjoy watching Patrick Roy throw temper tantrums so at least there's that. Varlamov will steal some games from them and our games with them are always heated, usually physical, and usually close.  Nashville still has Pekka Rinne, he will keep them in a lot of games this season as long as he stays healthy. They didn't add any major pieces so the offense will still continue to be an issue. Honestly I don't know too much about what they've done so I could just be talking out of my ass, but if you have Rinne between the pipes, at least you won't be terrible.  Winnipeg is exactly the opposite - a young, up-and-coming team with some good skill up front but unreliable goaltending. Hutchinson has yet to play a full season in the league and Pavelec is the kind of guy that can put up back-to-back shutouts only to let in 6 goals the next game. I think they still sneak into the playoffs this year.  That finally brings us to the Wild...I won't go into a ton of detail since it's our sub but 2015 is all about the growth of our youngsters and taking the next step. We have playoff experience now (three years in a row after a long drought). Dubnyk will regress a bit but he's built for our brand of hockey. We just need Kuemper to not be a head case on the nights Dubnyk takes off (which will probably be few and far between). There's no reason to believe we won't make a serious run this year as long as we stay healthy, get good goaltending, and the locker room atmosphere holds (we've almost made it a year without kicking walls, and almost six months without having a coach go ballistic on camera!)  All in all, we play in arguably the toughest division in hockey and I'm predicting both Wild Card spots coming out of the Central.  TL;DR Central Predictions:  1) Blackhawks  2) Wild  3) Blues  4) Stars (WC1)  5) Jets (WC2)  6) Nashville  7) Colorado"
wildhockey,3djozk,Robtangle,3,Thu Jul 16 21:01:33 2015 UTC,I think they need to get Kuemper some ice time and they will. The main reason Dubs never had any games off is due to the fact it was all must win territory.
wildhockey,3djozk,imgonnaquit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:40:00 2015 UTC,"Even though they lost Sharp, Oduya, and Saad, they turned right around and got Panarin, Dano, Tikhonov, and Anisimov. I feel like Panarin is going to be really really good. Led St. Petersburg in scoring and he started in the KHL at 17..."
wildhockey,3djozk,thunderbirds-53,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:16:09 2015 UTC,On the one hand Chicago has survived cap dumps before. On the other hand if they stumble tremendously this year no one will be surprised.  Dallas is one of the really interesting stories. They did an awesome job last year in the offseason and were very front heavy. They improved their goaltending and added some defense. At the beginning of last year they were highly ranked but underperformed. this year. They look stronger... again.  If the wild had stable goaltending for the entire regular season last year who knows where we would have finished. Seeing how we are largely the same team I'm fairly confident we'll be better next year from our own growth. I think the wild card for us is how much change happens to take the thunder dome up a notch. Yikes.
wildhockey,3djozk,Upscalebobcat28,3,Thu Jul 16 22:45:10 2015 UTC,"As for the whole division I really don't have a guess, but I do think that the Predators will be slipping out of the playoff picture this coming season though. No stats to back this up, just based on the eye test, I think they overachieved this year, and they're on Pekka Rinne injury(happens a lot) away from being bottom of the central"
wildhockey,3djozk,_BeerAndCheese_,3,Thu Jul 16 20:48:13 2015 UTC,"Boy this division could honestly roll any kind of way. I truly believe literally anyone could win this division or come in last place. Case in point: Colorado won it two seasons ago (considered a weak team), and Nashville won it last season (considered the weakest team) while Colorado finished last. It's going to be another huge brawl where anyone can get into the playoffs from start to finish, but let's start with those two.  Nashville I think is going to get much the same treatment as they did last pre-season; overlooked, despite being the division champs, and it's not hard to see why really. Youngster Forsberg, newcomer Neal, and vet Ribeiro were the de facto leaders of a surprisingly high-powered offense, but can that trend continue? There's no reason to expect a backslide, but damn it's hard to envision them to continue to be that good or better. And outside that you just don't have anything that really scares you on offense. On the flipside, their notoriously studly defense is even study-er. Josi, Weber, Jones, backstopped by Rinne, along with a lot of 2-way players, dayum that is a stingy D. They started to trend downward hard at season's end, which a lot of people are going to remember. I think they are in.  Colorado is also an oft-dismissed team, and just lost ROR, but as I pointed out in the main hockey sub - Colorado may have finished last, but they did so with 90 points, above nine other teams. Considering that was 90 points in the ThunderDome, I think it's safe to say the Avs were better than about half the other teams in the league. Still though, nothing here convinces me they will improve much, if at all, and I think this is my nearest to a sure pick still for last, but they'll be in the mix the entire way.  Dallas were the most prolific scorers behind TB last season (who made it all the way to the finals) - with the Beguinn duo getting another year of seasoning, and the acquisition of Sharp, I just can't see them being anything other than the number ones in goals this year. And can you really score the most goals in the league and miss the playoffs? I don't think their D could be any worse from last year, plus they also snatched Oduya. The rest of their defense is pretty wholly unproven and young - Stars fans swear up and down they are better and they've improved by subtractions, but we'll see. That being said, their goaltending will at least be a little better, and they likely won't be the fourth worst in the league in goals against (barely above the three that were actively trying to lose games). With all this considered, I actually don't think it will be possible for them to miss.  While everyone talks about the Jets trending upward, I honestly think last season was their peak. Don't get me wrong, they are still a good, ridiculously physical smash-and-grab team, but seriously like every single person on their team had a career high year. I just don't think it happens again, particularly Pavelec. Does anyone think that guy is truly a .920 SV% goalie? No way. I'm penciling them in as a miss, contending closely with the Avs for last (which still won't be far behind everyone else). I can see this team getting frustrated with losses and refs cracking down on them with penalties.  The Blues I think we'll see the same ole' song and dance that we see from them every single year. Regular season monster, likely a fart in the post-season. They lost Oshie, who I think is over-rated by most fans outside of the Blues (who love to scapegoat him, it seems). I don't think the loss of him was a big deal, he started to feel like an odd-man out there; clearly a skilled player who just can't get it together enough to consistently crack the top-line in favor of the Blues other strong players. Tarasenko will be a freak of nature. I think their grip on the Central as a for-sure top 3 team will definitely be loosened, but they will still make the playoffs.  Interestingly I see Chicago as the most wild-cardy team in the Central; yes, the near dynasty that just won it's third Cup in six years feels to me like the team most likely to finish either at the top or at the bottom. I think we'll see a similar season from them as we saw after they won the Cup in 09/10 - the difference is though, that while they still made the playoffs the following two years with a strong team (to lose in the first round both times), they did it in a division (and conference) that isn't anywhere near as good as it is today. A minor step back in this division right now could cause a team to slide waaaay back in standings while only losing a few extra points. It's gonna be that tight. Obviously they are still a ridiculous team, but they still need to shed some salary (I think?), and no question they already lost some big-name players. For fun I'm going to be bold, and say the Blackhawk's absolutely ridiculous luck with injuries runs out and a key player (or two) goes down for significant time, and they barely miss.  And finally, the home team. Will the Wild be closer to the beginning half of the season, or the latter? I think you can safely bet that our play will lie somewhere in the middle. Suter will improve over last year's personal struggles; Vanek will continue his improvement and I would not be surprised to see get up near to 30 goals; Pommers career worst shot percentage bounces back and contributes some extra points. The team as a whole has players vying for just about every position in the line-up, which is the best kind problem to have, and pretty rare for an NHL team. Pretty much everyone is past the possibility of the dreaded ""sophomoric slump"", and we can't really expect any backslides out of anyone (other than Dumba, whom I will be watching closely). Dubs unfortunately can no way sustain his season play with us last year, unless he is in fact a god in goalie form, but he still will be more than solid enough for us. With all this being considered, I think the Wild are (homer glasses on) closer to a division champ than they are a wild card spot, and so obviously are in.  TL;DR : Blues, Wild, Stars, Predators are in; Avs and Jets are out. Bold prediction is that the Hawks barely miss.  Will be fun to look back on this and see how horribly wrong I am."
wildhockey,3djozk,TheKodachromeMethod,0,Thu Jul 16 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"Hawks - Still the team to beat until proven otherwise. They have lost a lot in the offseason, but that didn't hurt them much last time they had to dump a bunch of players after winning the cup.  Blues - Still built to do well in the regular season, still going to flop in the playoffs. On their way down too, I think they'll have to blow up the team after the season.  Wild - If we can avoid a huge slump things will be looking good. Might even sneak past the Blues. Somewhat contingent on certain guys getting better (cough cough, Granlund & Coyle).  Jets - Definitely trending up.  Preds - I think they're poised for a big step backwards, but I'd also hate to bet against them.  Stars - I don't see how they are any better then last season honestly.  Avs - Yeah they have a lot of talent up front, but what is going on with the rest of that roster? Not good enough. (Now watch them win the damn division).  Edit - Fuck you for downvoting my perfectly cromulent opinion."

They added another starting goalie (Niemi), a top 6 winger (Sharp), and a top 4 d-man (Oduya) without really losing anything.  Seguin and Benn are a year more mature.  I'd be surprised if they missed the playoffs."

wildhockey,3djozk,dowdle651,2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:31 2015 UTC,"Chicago-This is still the Toews, Kane, and Keith show, they'll slump from losing key pieces, but i'll believe in their demise when I see it.   Wild-We have a real shot, but it's contingent on players with potential that have yet to achieve with the Wild. Vanek needs to have a better second season, which I think is possible. Koivu and Pomminville need to stay competitive and not fall of a cliff production wise. Granlund and Coyle need to become who we've been anticipating. Dumba keeps progressing and we'll be fine. Zucker and Nino could truly fuck shit up as our 1-2 punch in youth scoring. If our fourth line can continue to engulf offensive production without Cooke and Brodziak, Haula is a good penalty killer and fast as fuck, hopefully he shows up to camp in shape this year and gains some trust.  I'm curious to see who is the final roster after training camp, but with all these pieces I think we've got a shot. If everything clicks holy shit we'll be a scary team. Just a lot of if. Though this season i'm anticipating/hoping were not screaming into the playoffs. I am hoping this is the year that we are consistent in the regular season.   Saint Louis Blues- Still going to be dirty in the regular season, but we'll see in the post. It's hard to see them changing enough to fix this problem. Their focus on grit and pests was their downfall in the postseason but if when they get down and focus on hockey they are scary, but it looks like were facing the same monster. Personal note, Kyle Brodziak hurts.   Nashville Predators-They have the stuff, and with the playoffs comes more experience, I would expect them to still be in the mix, but doubt they'll be as dominant in the regular season as this year, maybe more of a wildcard, but they do have the talent to repeat so we'll see.   Winnipeg Jets- I think they are just going to get better, I think they're on the way up, maybe they take another step forward, but it's hard to see. On a personal note I love the rivalry brewing here.   Dallas Stars- Tough to call. With the addition of Niemi, Oduya, and Sharp, they could be dirty, or the defensive and goaltending holes could continue. Sharp adds to an already terrifying scoring core in Dallas. With Oduya adding on defense and possibly consistent net minding they could be the team to shake shit up. This all remains to be seen if they can put it all together effectively, but their potential still scares me.   Colorado Avalanche- I'm expecting much of the same. Personally I think Roy and Sakic are wrong for this team, at least from what i've seen. Don't get me wrong Roy had a great first season, and did reinvented the goalie pull, but I really think that'll prove to be an aberration season. If you believe in PDO anyhow. I think they will continue to struggle. That being said they do have talent, and I refuse to count anybody out in this fucking division. Maybe Mackinnon comes out of the sophomore slump and terrifies the whole division, who knows.    TLDR Basically anything could happen, nothing is impossible in this fucking division."

wildhockey,3djozk,sixsixeightsix,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:25:18 2015 UTC,My opinion is: 1. Wild (I really think with Dubnyk in net all Year you have a really good shot to take the Division) 2. Hawks (they're still the Hawks...core will make new players better) 3. Blues Not sure on how the rest will end up.  Honestly the whole division could go many ways.
wildhockey,3djozk,metralo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:38:36 2015 UTC,"Hawks will compete for the cup again, Blues will be #1 or #2 in division, and everything else is a crap shoot. It will be really close. I can see us not even making the playoffs."

wildhockey,3dfkai,IamKEIL,4,Wed Jul 15 22:52:29 2015 UTC,"When I saw the title of the post, that was the first goal that came to mind. Damn, I am excited to see more of Dumba."
wildhockey,3dfkai,Itzuproar,3,Wed Jul 15 23:35:19 2015 UTC,"My favourite was the first one against Ottawa, you could hear that ping. Too bad they botched the call on it, but I guess we weren't too familiar with how strong Dumba's shot was so they thought it was Pommers haha."
wildhockey,3dfkai,AllisGreat,3,Thu Jul 16 02:44:50 2015 UTC,THAT'S MY FAVORITE PLAYER

wildhockey,3dfkai,bminus88,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:34:19 2015 UTC,Hearing them call the PP goals just brought back all my anxiety about our power play.... He better be on the number one unit next year.
wildhockey,3df805,GOGOWILDGO,9,Wed Jul 15 20:18:30 2015 UTC,Yes. The Ducks frighten me. And now they have Stewart.
wildhockey,3df805,DaRealHankHill,4,Wed Jul 15 22:24:18 2015 UTC,I was slightly relieved when we re-signed Ryan Carter for this reason. Much less expensive than Cooke and what we thought Brodzy would cost. Although I still worry about this some too. It'd be nice to have another physical-style player or two out there. Hopefully Gabriel can eventually step into that role for us up here.
wildhockey,3df805,bobby_blue,5,Wed Jul 15 22:44:28 2015 UTC,"Nope. You probably won't either when/If the wild score on the powerplay and when the fourth line wins hockey games for the wild and makes the othe fourth line look silly because they're not as fast. I don't understand why people will miss Stewart when barely one any border battles in the playoffs except for maybe one.  Carter,Scandella, Prosser,Niederreiter, Coyle, I think Folin if given a chance can be physical Presence. I  think they all would stand up for other guys on the team also potentially Graovac to an extent. Just because the wild don't have designated player to be just a phyiscal player doesn't mean they're aren't players on the team capable being a physical presence. It probably makes the wild better by having players that can be both good at playing hockey and a physical presence."
wildhockey,3df805,nth28,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:26:05 2015 UTC,Folin beat the shit out of Richards last year IIRC
wildhockey,3df805,thunderbirds-53,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:18:29 2015 UTC,"I won't go as far as everything you said (I think we will definitely have problems against the Jets first and foremost and then the Ducks), but I am happy we didn't re-sign Stewart. Sure he was good in the stretch at the end of the season, but he was just taking up space during the playoffs. I'm happy that we get to see younger guys step in to that spot. I felt Schroeder definitely deserved a spot.  However, I'm still scared to play the Jets next season. They just absolutely crushed the Wild physically last year. Fucking buff"
wildhockey,3df805,LRonHoward,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:45:27 2015 UTC,I'll worry about is winning the hockey game. With Byfuglien he just did solid check on Granlund that ended badly for Granlund which was kind of flukey. But that's about it.
wildhockey,3df805,nth28,2,Thu Jul 16 12:03:14 2015 UTC,"we've got guys in the system that can throw the body around, and we don't have to spend any cap space on them."
wildhockey,3df805,fastal_12147,2,Thu Jul 16 00:33:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, not scared. Our players aren't going to back down because they aren't known as fighters. Nino and Coyle can work the boards like no other. Scandella is big, and Dumba plays way bigger than his size. Worst comes to worst we got Prosser (lol), shit on him if you want but he plays solid as a 6D and is tough.   Our star players won't back down when things get physical either, Parise is Parise, Zucker is the next Parise, Vanek goes to the front of the net every shift, Koivu... remember that reverse Kronwall hit? Only guys that might be a little soft are Pommers, Granlund, Haula, but I'm not too worried since they're smart enough to not get rocked by clean hits."
wildhockey,3df805,AllisGreat,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:47:57 2015 UTC,"I understand that GMCF, Yeo, and the organization as a whole have tried to really shape our team in a new light since our acquisition of Parise and Suter. We've focused on building our speed and finesse, at times sacrificing elements that were more grit-focused. I think this has made our team better, especially since I believe our identity as a team is that of a scoring/finesse team. Having said that, I'm a little disappointed we did not hold on to some of the players that brought some physicality to the game. Money is tight, but having a physical presence on the ice can really aid your team when it matters most."
wildhockey,3df805,RunnerOfRohan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:46:59 2015 UTC,"Just remember that they have a lot of big bodies in the pipeline now. So while that may not help them this season (although Gabriel could be a big help here), the team will be increasing in average size over the next several years."
wildhockey,3df805,PabloNueve,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:08:25 2015 UTC,"Carter can fight, Scandella is a big dude, Prosser can fight, Coyle and Nino probably can, and Kurtis Gabriel can be a tough guy call up."
wildhockey,3df805,thunderbirds-53,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:14:19 2015 UTC,"Brodz is a tough guy? Ehhhhhhh, I wouldn't really say that. Parise plays a more hard-nosed physical game than Brodzy does. Being phenomenal on the defensive side, or playing on the 3rd/4th line =/= tough. Sure he wasn't a push-over by any means, but he's not a player who stands anyone up or puts anyone on notice. He wasn't even particularly excellent in the boards compared to many of the players on our team.  Stewart is a weird one. There were games where it seemed like he was flying around, skating hard, pinballing off people ala Clutterbuck. But then other games where I'd never notice him whatsoever. Hell there were games that he'd have 3-4 shifts where you notice him in a big way, but then outside that it was like he wasn't even there. His presence would just evaporate. I didn't expect him back next season because he didn't bring enough to the table consistently to hold back potential call-ups (this is the exact reason he's bounced around the league so much, BTW).  But anyway on to my main point. One tough guy does not a tough team make - this is a weird notion that many fans have that I don't get. No, I'm not really concerned with our team being softer because Stewart's 10-12 minutes a game or whatever is gone. You get a tough team by purposefully building for it. You draft big powerful guys, you develop and coach those guys to play hard-nosed hockey, you give those guys lots of ice time. You can't plug two ""tough"" guys into a team on the fourth line and suddenly expect the team to morph into something where they can contend physically with the Jets, the Ducks, the Blues, etc etc. 'Toughness' is a philosophy you build, not something you plug in here and there and play."
wildhockey,3df805,_BeerAndCheese_,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:29:28 2015 UTC,"Coyle is 6'3"" and about 220 and started playing mean last year.  Ryan Carter can stick his nose in there.  Folin is also a big boy and plays big.  Add to the fact that Nate Prosser's #1 skill is pissing off the other team after the whistle and I don't think the Wild are lacking in todays NHL.  the days of the goons and plodders who are there to mix it up are coming to a close.  Finding big guys that can actually play hockey is the real challenge."
wildhockey,3df805,Cepec14,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:41:00 2015 UTC,"We'll be okay with Folin and Prosser....Nino and Coyle would drop gloves, but lets hope they don't."
wildhockey,3df805,GrannnySmith,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"If you remember 3 years back, Stoner was our guy. He got traded to the Ducks. What happened? We improved our core game. Before that, we had Boogy (rip). He got traded. We got over it. There's nothing to worry about. If you look closely, size-size, we are pretty much demanding that new players are at least 6' tall and around 200 lbs. As long as we stay strong on our feet, we aren't going anywhere."
