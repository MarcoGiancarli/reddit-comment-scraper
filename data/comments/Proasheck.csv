Proasheck,3cjrsa,Crazy-Tea-Lady,13,Wed Jul 8 13:32:09 2015 UTC,"Confidence isn't something that you need to get, you create it for yourself (like luck). Right now I'm trying to read this brick of a book by a Danish philosopher for my bachelors and I feel like the dumbest person in the world and that I'll never make it. But I fight through it, slowly but steadily.  Take small steps. Learn a bit about editing to show to you that you can learn and do this. Youtube is filled with tutorials on simple editing and such. This will help you gain more confidence in yourself. It's ok to be bad at things, because it's the first step to be ok at them.  And I know that talking to parents about ones personal life is incredibly hard. You can try to do in increments, talk about whatever is easiest first. The more you talk about stuff with them the easier it gets to be more open.   Good Luck!"

Proasheck,3cjrsa,youtubefactsbot,4,Thu Jul 9 10:11:01 2015 UTC,"For all the cliche, just do it. You sorta have to not think about what could/will happen with trivial things, because there's 99.99% chance it's a fine outcome (even if you don't get what you asked for, it's just a mediocre, average ""no"" or whatever)  but your brain (or at least mine) will almost always focus on the 0.001% that could go wrong, and make it seem that a 10% or maybe even 50% chance. So if you overthink things, they'll end becoming more stressful. Unfortunately because the brain is stupid, trying not to think about things is exactly what makes you think about them sometimes, so I'd recommend you look into confidence and stress relief online, I'm sure there are some great guides.

Proasheck,3cjrsa,DuckBillHatypus,3,Wed Jul 8 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"I can completely understand the lack of confidence and not being able to talk about things. My parents didn't know how much I struggled with depression and anxiety at school until recently (I'm 27) because I just didn't know how to talk about it. I got a big boost when I left school and realised that there is a big world out there and that all the stuff I was worried about didn't really matter that much. There isn't much I can say to help but I can give you 3 pieces of advice I wish I got a lot earlier in life...  1- your still just a baby in the grand scheme of things (I don't mean to offend or patronise you, I only mean don't pressure yourself to have it all figured out so quick)  2-do what feels right to you! Only you know what will make you happy and while others advice should be listened to don't take it as gospel. If you aren't hurting anyone with your choice in hobby/career then go for it  3-and finally.... Don't take life to seriously. Tho is the hardest thing in the world to hear and can be even harder to achieve. I still have problems with depression and anxiety and sometimes it feels like life is really kicking my butt! The only way I get through it is to remind myself that this is all a big cabaret!"

By linking a youtube account (probably best to create a new one specifically for livestreams) to your twitch the export option becomes available on your VOD's, then enter the video title and twitch will handle the processing and uploading so you don't have to deal with it manually, you can upload as one big video or tell twitch to cut it into 15 minute episodes which will be automatically numbered.  I don't know what reasons you have to not put them on youtube but with the export feature time, laziness, hardware, downloading, editing, processing, uploading doesn't have to be one of them.  Your streams are amazing and I'd love to rewatch them all one day."

You know the feeling you sometimes get when you feel like everything you're doing is wrong, and that everything that could go wrong will go wrong? Imagine that, 24/7. A little buzz of tension in your head putting you constantly on edge, a physical response of your body to danger, that should usually happen only in a few chose moments, but that being broken and happening all the time.  That's the best I can do to create an image for someone that doesn't suffer from it. And all of that, and I still feel that my anxiety is still not as bad as what she is going through. So yeah, it's not easy in any form of the word. It's a war with your own body that unfortunately you sometimes just can't win. But I'm pretty sure she's doing her best. Even so that can take time. Sometimes a lot of it. Yes it has been a long time. She's probably more aware of it than anyone else, and it's way more painful to her that she can't do it than to any of her fans waiting for her.   Obviously, all of this is just an opinion from someone that also suffers from anxiety. I may be wrong on many points. But hopefully I can at least help a bit explaining how it may feel to someone for who it is unimaginable. Her videos got me through a lot of very hard times, so if I can give something back, it's the least I can do."
Proasheck,38t2qq,Zangis,-1,Sat Jun 6 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"yes and i didnt say she doest want to continues, its may well be that she just cant and have moved on."
Proasheck,38t2qq,Zangis,3,Sat Jun 6 17:29:51 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that moving on would imply that she no longer wants this to be her main job. And by wanting I don't mean some hope in the back of your head or a dream of something you think you'll never have, but actually doing things to make it happen as well. Apologies if I wasn't clear enough."
Proasheck,38t2qq,majorkurn,10,Sat Jun 6 17:33:16 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the time spent on Nano's Village will help restore her strength at being on Youtube/Twitch, I love watching her videos and miss her content :) But if she'll be happier off youtube/twitch, then so be it :)  I just hope she is still reading our words of encouragement for whatever path she chooses :)"
Proasheck,38t2qq,dontwaitincinerate,7,Sat Jun 6 17:54:58 2015 UTC,"why are so many people being so negative about needing a break? dealing with anxiety (for me, anyway) generally involves a lot of ""oh god, i really wish i could do ~whatever~ right now, i actually really want to do ~whatever~ right now, but the thought of actually doing it is so overwhelming that even thinking about it makes me uncomfortable"".  and like zangis said, she is probably quite aware of it, and if it was me, that would make everything even more overwhelming. at one point in my life, i had to take about a week off of work because the thought of going outside/interacting with people made me feel physically ill. the fact that i called it in so abruptly, forcing my coworkers and boss to scramble to cover my shifts was a terrible feeling. and that's was just working at a movie store that employed like seven or eight people. i can't even imagine how feeling the need to return to 450 000 people would be, especially with some of them essentially chanting ""are we there yet?"" (maybe she isn't thinking about that though, and if she isn't, then great! it's not something that's that important when it puts your mental health at risk.)  alternatively: recovering from mental health issues is no different than recovering from physical health issues. if she had suddenly been affected by some sort of physical illness, and needed to recover, would people still be counting the days since her last video, and assuming that she'll never return?  and y'know, maybe she won't. and that's okay, because at the end of the day everybody needs to do what's best for themselves. if stopping youtube is what's best, then i would wish her the best of luck and all of the happiness.  tldr; recovery takes time, that amount of time varies from person to person, and at the end of the day stable mental health is infinitely more important than pushing out youtube videos.  (also, i find that fact that people are rounding up what are likely considered to be negative things and calling them ""milestones"" to be utterly rude, but that is my own personal opinion. i don't think anybody would like to be reminded that ""oh hey remember that thing that you do that's awesome? well you haven't done it in awhile and that kind of sucks, just saying"".)"
Proasheck,38t2qq,LiquidMedicine,4,Sun Jun 7 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, no matter what Zoey and Fiona decide is best for them, whether it be producing content or not, what is important is that Zoey can overcome the anxiety she's facing now."

Proasheck,37ul58,Geenium_96,3,Sat May 30 17:49:53 2015 UTC,It seems the platypus robe can be gotten by linking a paradox account to your game. Make a paradox account at paradoxplaza.com once made and signed in click 'edit account' at the top of the page then click 'account settings' then link your steam account. Then you should be able to equip the robe in Magicka 2.

I might also have a area if people just want to survive, but I think I'll make it so it's encouraged to work on the tutorials a bit then once you've made some headway in that you can go off in the world.

On any other channel which I go on (and I go on a lot of channels), if they didn't upload anything, there would be outrage. People would be sending tweets and messages to the person constantly demanding to know where videos are, but not here. Here, the community has not only said next to nothing and has only offered support and kind words to Zoey and anyone else having a hard time out there. And I love that. We are all such an amazing and supportive community and I hope that never changes.  I, like everyone who has commented on this before me, also offer help to anyone who may need it."

Proasheck,30ekeo,Mister_Mystery_,6,Fri Mar 27 11:28:40 2015 UTC,"One of the way to get through the ""every noise makes me shiver"" part while making Youtube content could be to do collabs. If you have another person with you on voice chat to ""keep your head in the game"", you should be less likely to hear every cracks in the house.  Even if it's not for content purposes, having another person with you in any shape or form would help you with the difficult step of being alone in an empty house until SuperFiona gets back.  I don't know what is your relationship with Pyrion, but you could ask if you can guest-star in his streams when Fiona isn't with you. His explosive persona and playing Dota should distract you from what could be happening in a horror movie version of your situation.  For the getting outside your house part, just keep on trusting in Fiona. I'm betting she already has a plan to help you with that."

She also mentioned trying to put out more videos in an earlier stream. (Grow Home, Life is Strange, Mushbury, Pokemon, etc)  I think she's been doing these streams lately since they require less effort for more content than videos, since there's no editing nor much planning involved, especially with trying to work around Fiona's work schedule."
Proasheck,2xskhj,Slidejaw,3,Wed Mar 4 01:06:17 2015 UTC,Shes trying to get videos up. Shes mentioned trying to get videos out in one of the streams. I think shes doing these streams right now just to hold us over until she can relses the new videos.

I had to switch to another stream with Jane (One of the Mods of Zoeys chat)  because important stuff was happening in that stream.  Can someone give me a bit of a quick recap of the stream? Anything great i may have missed.?
Proasheck,2xho5i,Nisha_the_lawbringer,5,Sun Mar 1 02:39:14 2015 UTC,"Zoey's The Forest server was hijacked by a couple of people, most notably Ozzymod (Jack) who got pretty emotional about talking to Zoey and Fiona.  Zoey and Fiona acted adorable during The Sims 4. They rented 2 days of vacation and left after a few hours. Zoey was left alone and made Fiona's sim beat an evil sim up, call everyone's mother a llama, and almost skip work. Fiona's sim got a promotion, built a garden, and found a voodoo doll which was then bounded to Zoey. Zoey's sim grabbed a plant sample and played video games.  Deer God was just all kinds of hectic about Zoey and Fiona trying to learn how to video game.  None of this is in order, I realize, but that's the gist."
Proasheck,2xho5i,zowin_,3,Sun Mar 1 04:04:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for the recap.

I would guess that it wouldn't be for a while though because of her moving house, losing her kitty and because those series would require both Fiona and Rythian to be free to record as well. I hope that helped as I am seriously excited to see more as well :)"

Proasheck,2wi5s9,billionsofkeys,11,Fri Feb 20 02:37:04 2015 UTC,Well that and she has recently just gone through a loss and is grieving. So it may take a while. But I am patient and don't mind the wait as long as she starts to feel better.
Proasheck,2wi5s9,AcesulfameZ,11,Fri Feb 20 02:41:16 2015 UTC,"Her and Fiona moved into a new house at the end of last year and they are busy setting everything up and getting a recording space set up. The move took a pretty hard toll on her and the fact she recently lost Ziggy, (Her Cat), she is currently grieving.   She is trying to feel better and still has to set everything up. All we can do is be patient while she goes through all of this.   But look on the bright side, not only do Fiona and Zoey get to be together a lot more now, we will also probably be getting a lot more episodes of FiZone. So everybody wins in the end."
Proasheck,2wi5s9,Nisha_the_lawbringer,6,Fri Feb 20 14:15:24 2015 UTC,"She hasn't changed channels, Zoey and Fiona moved into a new house together at the end of last year, so far I understand Zoey's been too busy settling in, getting a recording space set up etc. along with all the other stressful things that come with moving. She mentioned on her stream the other day that they had recently been recording a new episode of beyond mushbury which I think is coming out soon.   Things might have taken a step back though recently as her cat Ziggy passed away as you might have seen :/ hopefully she's doing okay but it's understandable if she needs some more time to get over that. She will be back soon though :)"

My grandfather passed away earlier last month, and it was the first death I have ever experienced, and I cried so much, and I wasn't even very close to him compared to my mom (who was really... yeah... she wasn't so good). I can only imagine how hard it is to lose a friend that was always there for you, to cuddle in times of sadness. Similarly to Zig, my grandfather passed away peacefully in his sleep (they basically ""unplugged"" him because it was useless to try anything else).    It makes all a little better knowing that maybe they'd just had enough, and it's good to finally see them rest. Remember that all cats go to cat-heaven and play with other cats, and good ol' zig will be there :D   (also, if you don't believe in heaven or are not religious... I'm not talking about heaven... I'm talking about CAT heaven man. It totally exists and is where all cats go)  I hope things get better in the Proasheck house :c"

Recently the Yogs have been changing their skins to version with flux added, including Rythian. This caused a lot of hype but he quickly changed it back. Zoey's skin then changed to this, but it's clear that Zoey is just trying to troll us, or it might be part of her Beyond Mushbury series. Most likely trolling us though."

Proasheck,2sjdqm,Slushieboy99,3,Fri Jan 16 14:26:19 2015 UTC,"Nah, she's totally a golden girl."
Proasheck,2sjdqm,Hpfm2,3,Fri Jan 16 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"Fiona and Zoey playing Divinity: Original Sin on a more ""mature themed"" channel would be gold. Heck, it'd be platinum."
Proasheck,2sjdqm,stevehamner,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:49:47 2015 UTC,"For the mature content, you could have Fiona start a channel and put the mature stuff there. That way the Zoey channel can still be for kids friendly only, and it seems a lot of the wanting to do mature content is so Fiona can be herself anyway."
Proasheck,2sjdqm,viziroth,3,Fri Jan 16 08:38:16 2015 UTC,You should also remember that this is her job and she needs to make money.  (Zoey's channel with monetisation and an audience vs. a hypothetical second channel with neither.)
Proasheck,2sjdqm,Thorondor123,2,Fri Jan 16 14:18:14 2015 UTC,"True, but she can get all that on to Fiona's channel with proper community engagement and seo. The yogscast as a whole has launched a bunch of new channels last year, this wouldn't be much different. Further that, if they can build up the second channel, it could potentially be even greater revenue.   Not saying it's a prefect suggestion, just having it as a suggestion."
Proasheck,2sjdqm,viziroth,2,Fri Jan 16 14:27:00 2015 UTC,I find it that maybe it would be better for her to use conquest as a second channel.
Proasheck,2s2ffw,-Finners-,8,Sun Jan 11 16:00:53 2015 UTC,"50k USD, not pounds. (50k pounds would be more around 75k USD) Still impressive though!"

Proasheck,2qtq6m,AcesulfameZ,5,Tue Dec 30 20:54:46 2014 UTC,You know a stream is amazing when you're on a third rewatching only a day after it's happened
Proasheck,2qrlbq,TheCyberTronn,24,Tue Dec 30 00:51:43 2014 UTC,"I think it's awesome how Fiona told her she didn't have to go on camera when Zoey was too nervous initially. If the chat had tried to pressure her, this might have ended really badly, but Fiona would have been there to defend her which is really really awesome.  Even the chat was overwhelmingly understanding though. There is no doubt now that Zoey did this completely on her own and it's amazing to see how far she's come.  Thank you Zoey for being an inspiration for everyone with social anxiety and everyone in chat, and especially Fiona, for being so amazingly supportive and understanding :)"
Proasheck,2qrlbq,Nilpferdschaf,4,Tue Dec 30 01:42:09 2014 UTC,"Fiona telling her she didn't have to do it was the best course of action for Zoey to go on facecam. She went on because she deeply wanted to. She put the goal reach in and lowered the amount needed, even if she couldn't do it that night she would have showed her cute smile in early 2015 anyway. Because since she met Fiona she's conquering her anxiety.  Hell she went on camera drunk, with chocolate all over her teeth and with her hairs kinda messed up after streaming for hours and wearing a mask. And she still looked amazing. I wouldn't be surprised if she pop-up in a Yogs video in the next month, she's only a few steps away from complete remission."
Proasheck,2qrlbq,La_Truite,13,Wed Dec 31 15:55:42 2014 UTC,Id just like to add to this with a thank you to jane the mod with all those strawpolls!!
Proasheck,2qrlbq,halaparry,6,Tue Dec 30 01:00:18 2014 UTC,I can understand why a stream needs a poll but why would Zoey need a pole.

So proud of zoey, it was hilarious hearing her struggle with swearing and shots, I'm so glad she pulled through to the end though.  I'm especially proud of the community though, I don't think I saw the viewer count top 20k, and yet we were the 3rd highest (?) Total donation count of the month! What was the final total? That was insane.  Amazing stream with amazing people! Good work everyone!"
Proasheck,2qrlbq,Dutch_Wilkerson,9,Tue Dec 30 04:18:28 2014 UTC,"I agree, very brave of both of them, they were both completely awesome :3 That stream was by far my favorite this year (and possibly ever) the girls did a great job and pretty much had me crying of laughter all night long.   And also big thank you to all of the donators, to Ziggy and also to Jane!!  Well done to everyone, this night (and early morning if your gonna get technical) was one that I don't think anyone is going forget for a while!! xx <3"
Proasheck,2qrlbq,KKTheKat7,8,Tue Dec 30 01:07:32 2014 UTC,Best stream all month
Proasheck,2qrlbq,hazza987,8,Tue Dec 30 01:27:02 2014 UTC,"This was a really great night. Not only the a lot of money was given to charity, not only did we get to hear Zoey and Fiona getting drunk and swearing on the stream but we finally got to see both of them on facecam. And despite all the joy it gave to fans, this is perhaps most important thing for Zozo herself, kicking the knob jockey outta her anxiety!  I'd like to point out that this was being led to not by few hours of gathering money and lowering stretch goals for them to meat each other (holy molly, check out the jump in donations after 11pm), but rather by long years of anxiety an small steps toward endgame, as it was nicely put by Zoey.  I'd like it also be a lesson to all of you struggling with anxiety yourself. If the task you want to take scares you, divide it into smaller ones. And even if you are only able to accomplish some of them, don't feel bad about that, try to feel proud that you've done more that you'd do if you've given up in the first place. And remember, accomplishing just 10% of original task means you've decimated it!  And finally, something that my therapist said that really helped me get through rough times and was also mentioned by Fiona when Zoey was about to show herself: ""You don't have to."". Do not pressure yourself into something you want to do. Give yourself a rest and try again when you feel stronger.  So, before I go off on a tangent, three shots, the talk and Carrot for a Cock! Yay Zoey and Fiona! Yay charity!"
Proasheck,2qrlbq,Chmis,10,Tue Dec 30 09:30:37 2014 UTC,It felt a bit weird for the disembodied voices from my computer called Zoey and Fiona to suddenly have faces. Anyway: Great stream girls!
Proasheck,2qrlbq,pretorianlegion,4,Tue Dec 30 18:01:41 2014 UTC,Definitely. Especially with Zoey. My brain took a bit to realize that that's the face the Zozo-voice comes from :O

Proasheck,2qrlbq,Cat_on_plaid,7,Tue Dec 30 04:24:14 2014 UTC,"I cannot begin to explain how proud of Zoey I am! I've been watching her videos since day one, and I've seen how far she's come in such a short period of time. In her early videos, she was nervous enough behind a mic, and today she beat her anxiety and went on camera. That was absolutely incredible and I honesltly feel so proud of her. Well done Zoey, we'll always be here for you! Stay awesome!"
Proasheck,2qrlbq,teatowls,7,Tue Dec 30 04:35:53 2014 UTC,"Those two were amazing last night <3   No one would have been upset if Zoey decided she couldn't come of camera and she did it anyway despite her anxiety, I don't care if we never see her again; she beat her anxiety and that's all that matters."
Proasheck,2qrlbq,Pirikko,6,Tue Dec 30 11:39:37 2014 UTC,What a great stream it was. Haven't had this much fun in a while :) Doing the facecam bit shows how brave she is and really makes me hope and makes me know that I can get over my anxieties.

Proasheck,2qs640,SledgeGameTalker,4,Tue Dec 30 15:23:05 2014 UTC,"I actually showed up to reddit just to see if someone had already looked into this (the comparison of sums and stats, etc.).   I remembered that the first night was over a hundred, so it probably did remain ""unbeaten"" - but being the THIRD biggest, for stream of Zoey and Fiona - that is IMPRESSIVE.   I expected that much - only a few streams had managed to raise sums that were close to that magnitude. Nice to know the exact numbers.   I also do believe that the first HaKiMon stream had at least somewhat larger number of viewers. While I could be wrong (even though I was watching, but my memory is blurry by now) - I think the number was somewhere around 26 000, at least in some parts of the night. While Zoey's stream, on the other hand - had about 10 000 less, even at peak times.   Which makes this even more impressive and admirable. Zoey and Fiona did really awesome on this stream. Without question. :)"

Proasheck,2j06xt,throwawayasheck,6,Sun Oct 12 04:59:38 2014 UTC,"I suffer from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and low level Autism. I've never felt like I could be myself, mostly because I've never known myself as anything other than a scared, helpless child with identity issues. Youtube, Zoey in particular, gave me a sense of normality.   Anyhow, thanks for sharing your story! We all like hearing people's stories, Zoey especially likes to know that she genuinely helps people. <3"
Proasheck,2j06xt,TheDan7933,5,Sun Oct 12 06:37:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your story with us! Also, thanks for making me realize I'm not alone... I thought I was one of the few people with struggles that you also had, with the specific anxieties and the whole thought or ""real men don't cry, right?"". I used to be pretty sure I was a wuss, just bawling my eyes out when I got the chance to. It somehow feels better that other people have what you have, at least you're not alone. I'm also a collection of bipolar and social anxiety, which do NOT mix. Sometimes I feel on top of the world, every other time I want to rip my hair out and punch a hole in the wall then hang myself... Which basically sums up that I kind of like crying as you do, because my eyes are dried out. Besides that, I hope you feel well right now :c if not, I can almost say I know how you feel, friend.  Anyways, thank you for coming on here and sharing your story with us all, I hope Zoey gets a chance to read this so she can see more cases of people she helped out greatly."
Proasheck,2j06xt,pretorianlegion,4,Sun Oct 12 06:08:06 2014 UTC,"You're right. That IS a pretty awesome name. It's really brave of you to write such personal things here on the interwebs, but rest assured: If there is a community where people can write about this stuff it's here.  I too feel that it's problematic how people are always portrayed as having only minor flaws in media. You rarely find someone who has real and deep issues in series or even movies. Sure they have problems, but it seems like their problems can't go too deep, because they have to get over them in the course of the 30 minute episode :/ In stead all characters are just slightly off from being ""normal"" which is an empty and meaningless word as it refers to something that doesn't exist.  I don't have anything with a name. Not that I know of at least. I'm just weird. I lived my teenage years in a state of perpetual emotional numbness. Yes I laughed. Yes I had family and a couple of friends (eventually) that were just as weird as me. But real deep emotions were something I didn't feel really. Until I met this really awesome person. She was weird too. She had perpetual overload of feelings. Sad. Angry. Happy. All in amounts that I didn't know existed and I wont ever feel for myself. But it was because of these things. Things that is ""usually"" considered flaws that we fit together so well. Why we could make each other happy. I became her anchor and she became my conduit for feeling. Suddenly I could be truly sad and truly angry and truly happy. I have never felt so alive. Those were the best years of both of our lives.  I'm not sure I have a point, but it might be this: Fitting into social norms and being like ""everyone else"" (whoever that is) isn't what life is about. It's about finding what's right for you. And accepting what and who you are is the first and hardest step. (sorry for the cornyness) Morale option number 2: The people who really matter won't love you despite your ""flaws"", they will love you because of them. Morale option number 3: Zoey is awesome. And so are you  PS. I like crying too, but I've lost my conduit, so it doesn't happen anymore."

No pressure to go over the top and overkill to impress us. I mean, I think 99% of here really appreciate when she does (which seems to be all the time), but the thing that all of us here love the most is when Zoey is herself. It is a great reminder for us that it is okay for us to be ourselves.   Oh, as an aside, if we call Zoey ""Proasheck"" , can we call Fiona ""coolasheck""? Cause she totes is."

Today I saw Zoey tweeting a link for her new ""you are awesome"" video. I started watching it then decided i should watch the original first. I burst into tears watching it. it is hard to make this 16 year old guy cry, but you did it. I've been bullied, very physically, before, and i've never particularly fit in that well at school. recently I've been struggling with some of my friends as well, and the video just hit home so hard. When you got to the end and starting crying yourself I was crying even more, and i had a huge smile on my face when you said how happy you were for the fans. I then watched the new one and it wasn't sad like the first, I had a smile on my face for a lot when you were talking and at the end you said to smile, I couldn't help it and it was amazing how good a talker you are. I don't know the last time a youtube video made me uncontrollably smile like that. You are honestly very talented at this, and it made me forget my problems. I've decided to start watching your videos now as a result of this. Congrats Zoey, you've gained another well deserved subscriber _^  And as proof it does get better, 6 years later I'm friends with the guy that bullied me and we can joke about it.

Her most popular work is ""Self Help For Your Nerves"", I believe. I've only completely read one of her later books, ""More Help For Your Nerves"", but I truly recommend her works to anyone who has nervous problems. It helped me a lot in understanding my condition and coping with it."

I do not believe it has any impact on the message, the quest, of this game. A lot of the reviews for it are bad; check the Steam-Store-Page (5 reviews -> all bad). This game does not seek to entertain, it is a form of education, and maybe comfort or a wake up call.   Looking from the outside into the Protagonist mindset is somewhat unsettling. I understand most of her feelings, I have been (still am) there, but then being in a position to choose what to do with it, and you know from experience what you have been doing and what you 'could'/'should' be doing. It feels a bit like being smacked in the face with a mirror. In a good way.  Of course everyone is different and your experience may differ.  If you just mean that she shouldn't record it, probably not. Even without the drama, it just wouldn't make a good video."

Come mid-September I'm sure Zoey will be feeling a lot better and will be up to making videos again.  I'd also just like to thank you for being so positive about the matter. Rather than your typical ""Urgh where are the videos? Gonna unsubscribe!"" you seem genuinely excited to see Zoey's new Minecraft series.  Anyway, I hope you understand that Zoey is going through a rough patch at the moment. Depression really does make it harder to do day to day things.

She then mentions that three ""wonderful sirs"" offered to buy the island and look after it for her. We then see that she sold the island to the Tomodachi counterparts of Hatfilms. Then, at the end, after she launches herself into space, she gives her goodbyes and such for the series, we get a little song at the end from the trio about how they now own the island, and it's hinted throughout that they wish to totally control the island and everyone on it."

She lost focus a lot more easily, and was kinda... sad sounding sometimes.  I can't put an exact date on it, but there's definately a point where her system just sort of changes and she becomes much more... confident. It's like someone flipped a light-switch, and Zoey just lit up. I'm almost certain that Zoey's relationship started back then.  Fiona's a stabilizing effect on her... and she's also a really funny person besides."

Hmm.. there was a Princess Sim that TB did a while back and that one is great fun with someone just give suggestions next to you, so that might be a fun Fi Zone stuff.  Hmm.. gosh, I really can't seem to think of a better co-op game than Divinity.  Anyway, obviously those were just suggestions for games if you were considering any of them, but yeah, rather excited to see more cool stuff. I personally don't really mind if there is Minecraft or not, but that's just me."

We have already sca-I mean provided amazing service to everyone else on the server, and we want to help you too. Our amazing CEOs have scoured the land, looking for the best land to buy and sell to any customer, for any reasonable price. Now, we do have a lengthy contract we need you to sign, and perhaps one or two conditions others would find ""unfair"", but if you buy a plot of land now, you will receive a copy of my boss's debut novel ""The Lusty Walrus"", and its sequel, ""To Love Kermit"".

It's really inspirational and just brilliant to see.   This just feels like Zoey is entering a new era for her Youtube channel, and hopefully she feels like she herself is becoming a happier and more-awesome person! (If that was even possible.)  Zoey, as well has had a profound impact on my life despite the fact that I dont actually know her, nor have I ever talked to her directly. She has given me something to look forward to on a weekly basis, produced amazing, incredible, hilarious content that I really really enjoy and she's given me and many many others a great message: ""You are awesome.""   Although the main thing that I will be forever indebted to her for is for giving me courage and strength to be accepting of who I am, and accepting of other people -- no matter what. And I sort of made a bet with myself that if Zoey uploaded a picture of herself despite having crippling social anxiety, something that takes an insane amount of courage, far more than I could ever have, that I would then be able to come out as gay to my friends and family. And whilst I'm not in a place where I can follow through with that... this has helped me insanely towards that goal. So I thank Zoey for that, even if it was only indirectly that she helped me along :)!  TL;DR: Zoey is awesome! Good lookins, and I look forward to see what else she is cookins!"

I can't speak for Zoey but, if I were in her shoes and everyone said ""Good job for putting a picture of you on the internet! yay you! have a golden sticker!"" I'd be the slightest bit annoyed.   No offense, but a majority of you (from what I've seen) just seem to be treating her like a child or using her Social Anxiety for a reason on why she doesn't want to do things.  For example, in the Civ 5 lets play I saw many comments arguing on how she didn't talk and saying shes boring and should be kicked out. Then to no-ones surprise, the white knights came rushing in saying ""oh its because she has social anxiety you knob"".  Have any of you ever thought maybe she doesn't talk because she doesn't want to talk, or doesn't show her face because she doesn't feel the need to or see the reason behind it?  I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just trying to give you a different point of view.

It made for such a perfect conclusion to the battle."
Proasheck,26w21r,THCW,3,Fri May 30 17:44:24 2014 UTC,"I know Zoey likes adding a story to games to make them better, but that couldn't have been better fitting if she scripted the game herself."

I just thought, ""Hey, self, why not know more about Zoey?"". So I subscribed and waited for new videos. This was a few months before her ""You are awesome"" Vlog, and when that did come out I definitely went ""Okay, this person is absolutely amazing."" and started watching the 2Spooky4Zoey week, and what really got me in was the Halloween livestream. Basically I became obsessed and started pestering you nice peeps here at reddit about muffins :D(I mean seriously how much of a fanboy freakout is that, that I had to change every alias I had to have muffins in them).  Basically I subscribed last summer, when I was kinda always doing nothing at home with no working computer and... sniff...

Proasheck,24lfls,ThinWhiteMale,2,Sat May 3 06:11:14 2014 UTC,"More or less the same, though I did see some of the shorter series and one off vids.

Proasheck,24lfls,The_GoatWhisperer,3,Sat May 3 13:49:26 2014 UTC,Euro Truck Simulator 2 got me subscribed

Proasheck,24lfls,Avenged7fold,3,Sat May 3 10:38:35 2014 UTC,"I first acquired an interest for Zoey's videos during her 'Q(U)ANDA' for reaching 250k subs. I have watched her videos intermittently since then.  I can't just sub to someone immediately if I barely knew him/her, you see. I've since from that video got to know her sense of humour and the community that surrounds the channel.  What really made me lock down that subscribe button was 'a message from Zoey'. As I watched that video, I got to know more about Zoey the person rather than Zoey the youtuber.   I have also learnt a little but more about myself when a mysterious band of ninjas started to cut onions around me.  After I have fended the ninjas off with lots of tissues and a night's rest, I thought to myself; ""You know what, Zoey is someone I can get behind."" And since then the big red button has changed to a big white 'unsubscribe' button.  Most youtubers I subscribed to are either my teachers or just a friend cracks jokes and then go out and have a beer with. Zoey is an odd one, as she is a bit of both. She is someone I'd follow to the ends of the earth and back.  EDIT: I suppose I would also have a beer with John or Hank Green, but the last sentence of the original comment still stands."
Proasheck,24lfls,Avenged7fold,2,Sat May 3 17:23:51 2014 UTC,I subbed the first day even before there was a vid on there for reasons of I'd tell you but then I'd have to kill you

We who gather here are different both in shape, size, and many other words which assuredly also begins with an s.

Thus, we strive to  brighten the day of every said lookins in such a good way possible using means of rainbows, free love and other extremely modern means of spreading happiness in the spirit of said YouTuber. Truly, there are few who can compete with this subreddit in the category of niceness.  It is the firmest of my beliefs that this community will continue in the aforementioned spirit as it blossoms and spreads its ideals. For is not the old saying ""the more, the merrier""?

Coincidentally, that is also the time it takes for a baby to become a full-size and almost ready for life person from a tiny little cell. But the voyage does not end here, no, it will continue, just as the child grows.  And thus, I wish to salute every single Good-lookins for the aid in making this community grow and continue to be a place of open-hearted friendship.  /sillyvoice  Is that good enough?"

Proasheck,233d9b,Dolsjb,2,Tue Apr 15 22:05:03 2014 UTC,"Here in Finland they use sheep to maintain meadows, from island meadows at the coast to park meadows near, or even in, towns and cities.   They produce more natural landscape than lawnmowers etc. and are of course relatively silent and clean. And they don't really leave anything behind, other than quickly biodegrading fertiliser :)  And people, especially kids, really like to see sheep in parks."

Proasheck,2313rx,Avenged7fold,2,Tue Apr 15 02:09:54 2014 UTC,"I can give you two answers.     You SHOULD be able to be yourself and attract viewers, but as other said, you may attract them at a much lower rate. I would recommend making videos for yourself instead of your viewers. It would serve two-fold as the quality of them would improve in the spirit of that passion and with less emphasis on whose going to see them, you may find your anxiety diminishing.    Develop your voice. This is also not as simple as I make it out to be. The person anyone is on-camera, is not the same person they are when they are not on camera. Comedians like steven colbert and louis CK, they are not as pithy and quick witted in real life, as I have seen them in private interviews and such. They are just exceptional performers, Louis happens to also be an exceptional writer, and steven has a team for that. But in either case, its a collaborative process of both you (the real you), and the portrayal (the you on screen).     In terms of production, you really cannot accurately 100% gauge how you will come off on screen because you are biased. Ive been there, I hate how I sound, look, and smell. But I cant fix those, because showering is for suckers, but also because I'm me, I spend all my time with me, I'm pretty needy like that. But it also means that I cant accurately gauge how I am seen by others, because they do not spend all their time with me, even though they really should. But the more you plan, or conversely the less you care, the more you can cater your production for your audience. I'm not sure how you will take this (and feel free to take EVERYTHING I say with a grain of salt.), but you can start to view the youtube you as a character, to be developed. Ala Steven Colbert. He develops that character to have a certain swagger, a way of speaking, finer points of detail, etc. But more than this, satire can be a truer way of expressing discontent then other forms of humor, and so I feel like stephen has an exemplary way of evoking his real feelings when he is playing a person unlike himself. Again, oversimplifying/question everything.    But if you look back at early Simon/Lewis, you see uncertainty, some ill-timed words, and if youve ever played video games with a friend, some frustration and anger. But the way they both speak now is drastically different. They developed their voice.  But that was their goal, have fun and make videos with friends. And any reason to perform or to be real on video are completely legitimate reasons to put yourself out there.   The real question is what do YOU want to do with your channel?  The videos are your tool to express yourself, or send a message, or educate.    tl;dr: 2 choices, 1. Keep on keepin on.  2. Fake it til you make it.  and have fun dammit :D    edit: also try teaming up with someone, see if that helps you sort of work into a rhythm. and whats your channel? I'd love to be the 1/day. :D"

At first I felt a bit weird imagining playing a gay character, but then I started wondering how gay people must feel when playing a straight character. I think it would be very enlightening to play a gay character, and I would love to see different reactions to a game that chooses to embark on this journey. I think it is very good to realize that the under representation of gay characters is indeed a problem, it is one I did not realize before."
Proasheck,22uxea,TheHeraldAngel,3,Sat Apr 12 19:08:02 2014 UTC,"Which begs a question, besides what happens in bedroom. What is the real difference between how a straight and a homosexual person acts? Is there really any big difference?"
Proasheck,22uxea,need-original-name,3,Sat Apr 12 20:08:19 2014 UTC,"Indeed a good question, although I don't think this discussion is about the way the character acts, but purely about hes/her orientation and indeed what happens in the bedroom. I agree there would be little difference in the non-romantic aspects of gameplay, but in current games it is not uncommon to have romantic/sexual scenes that are part of the plot and thus required to play the game. Having same sex relations necessary to finish a game has not really happened yet, and that likely will affect the game for a lot of people, in good and bad ways."
Proasheck,22uxea,TheHeraldAngel,2,Sat Apr 12 20:45:59 2014 UTC,"That reminds me of a Game called Rouge Legacy. Being Gay didn't change anything about the gameplay. Only thing it did change is in the ending credit where it showed the gender of his or her lover.  (did change which male or female statue gave you health or mana regen, but since they are always found next to each other, didn't change any gameplay)"
Proasheck,22uxea,need-original-name,2,Mon Apr 14 02:31:11 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I never really understood why being gay was an option in that game, since it changed so very little. Still better than not having the option at all I guess. Games like Fallout and Mass Effect have a similar setup.

Proasheck,21xkn3,FionaRiches,3,Wed Apr 2 10:06:31 2014 UTC,"You shouldn't be afraid to go a little off script and use your words to say your lines. The best actors always make the character their own. As long as the directive line is still there it won't affect the story and make your performance better.  Treat the script as a hint for getting the story from point A to point B. You don't have to say the exact words written on your piece paper.  The feeling I get when I watch this video and the Fizone is that you're stressed by scripted lines. So don't hesitate to change them a bit to make them comfortable for you.  Just go all out on them, that's the Yogscast way. Don't think about what the viewers will think just go with your guts.  And don't bother with youtube comments, most of them are utter troll's garbage (even TotalBiscuit still makes that mistake)."
Proasheck,21xkn3,La_Truite,12,Wed Apr 2 15:14:00 2014 UTC,"Fiona did a very good job with this video and deserves a lot of praise! We tried the unscripted route but it made the video turn into a load of drivel about nothing with no direction, so we tried it with lines for her and it worked out okay! We did try to mix it up a bit and make it looser, but she was nervous, bless her little cottons. Still, considering this is her first time doing something like this she totally nailed it I think, but if we ever do Minecraft in the future I'd like to aim more for the 'just say and do random stuff unscripted' route."
Proasheck,21xkn3,definitelynotzoey,11,Wed Apr 2 19:54:08 2014 UTC,"The fact that she was nervous made her ""read"" the lines. I can hear her stress during the video. Toward the end, she was getting into the character and was getting better at speaking more ""freely"".  Fiona did great nonetheless, and she will get better if she can remember to chill. The feeling I get when I watch when of your duo video is that she fears the reaction of the viewers whereas you seems to don't be bother with it. The fact that she was ""dropped"" into a succesfull channel instead of growing with it might be why she's stressed out.   She just needs time to ease into her new role and she will most likely have it. The unscripted random stuff will help her, she won't have time to think about what the viewers think if she has to react to the action.  Just remind her to be herself before recording a video until you don't have to."

Proasheck,20qx2d,jaredcheeda,5,Wed Mar 19 19:55:09 2014 UTC,"A Review and Critque  It seems like you're complaining about how parts of minecraft are tedious and thus make it boring, so your solution is to make it 100 times more tedius.  Spending episodes trying to just move gravel isn't fucking interesting when the vanilla version allows you to carry dozens of stacks of 64, and has since day one.  And it completely removes it's ability to play well with other mods. Which is the whole point of these series; Tekkit, Site Bee, Hexxit, Moon Quest, etc. These are all mod packs, it's not just a demo of the stuff you can do with one mod, it's about living in a new world, based on the general rules of Minecraft, but with much more things to explore.  Removing the usage of the GUI (of which almost every mod relies) means you can't have other mods involved unless they don't have anything AT ALL to do with the GUI, such as being able to Zoom in Tekkit, or having some type of Minimap, or biomes/mobs related mods. These, by the way, seem to make up a pretty small minority of mods. Any other mod that actually effects play, and not just environment, would need to be especially crafted for your mod. Which is a burden you can feel free to place on others, but I don't think it's going to get an overwhelming level of support.    An Idea, or Proposal  I'm not against removing the GUI, I think that could be interesting, if nothing else, as an experiment in play. But the idea that all of a sudden you need to hand move EVERY... FUCKING... BLOCK (with unique tools), is ridiculous and you deserve to be slapped. So here's my idea of how to handle inventory, without a GUI, purely in the first person view (or 3rd person if you have a craving for F5).  We'll start with chests. Chests will still exist, and take up one or two blocks worth of space, like they do currently. When you open one though, instead of seeing a GUI with the contents, you are instantly teleported to another dimension. You are inside a room where all of the blocks exist, laid out in a grid, like they are in the GUI, except you're able to walk around the grid and pick up and relocate items to the hotbar grid at the front of the room. Maybe even have the hotbar represented on each wall via the usage of item frames. At first I thought another chest in the room should be used to teleport back out to the overworld, but opening a chest carries the representation of ""going deeper"", or ""entering"" something, also you can keep a stack of chests inside other chests, so it could be confusing. So a better option would be  a doorway that leads back out of the chest.  This same concept works for a crafting table. You would have a room with your inventory laid out on the floor and in front of you would be a stage, like on a game show, with 9 slots (the crafting grid). You can pick up the items in the inventor or hotbar off the ground and put them in the upright grid and it will produce your new item. A mini (2x2 grid) version of this would exist in your personal inventory.  Which brings us to the inventory screen. This ""screen"" is much more different than the rest of what I've described above. Unlike the rest of the GUI dimension, you are not in an enclosed room. Instead, you are on a large floating platform. An island. This is your personal, internal space and on this island you can build and decorate whatever you desire. The only limitation is that you can't place objects that hold other objects, such as chests or furnaces. It doubles as a mini home. It could sort of represent your inner self that you travel to when searching your self, in the literal sense, for what you are carrying, but also in the more philosophical sense, as you can build whatever you want on your little personal island. Think more of things like Psychonauts, or the final Moon level on Majora's Mask.  As mentioned above, other items, beyond inventory and crafting require a GUI, like furnaces. These all get their own special rooms in the GUI dimension. Furnaces have unique design that differs from other blocks when you enter them, however all furnaces are identical, the only difference being that they hold the specific items left in that specific furnace.    Pros and Cons of this Proposal  Pros:   Feasibility: Alternate ""dimensions"" has be done by many other mods, so it's clearly possible. Compatibility: Use this alternate GUI Dimension allows for use of other mods, as it only changes the way blocks work that are a part of the default vanilla set. Other mods can still use the regular GUI, so an Coal Coke oven from Railcraft will still have it's normal GUI. However, other mods can opt-in to working with your mod by detecting if it's installed and if so creating their own rooms in the GUI dimension. Interest: With the Inventory Island, it adds interest to game in new ways. Other mod makers could expand from this and create other floating islands with castles, dungeons, temples, etc. that you could branch of from your island to reach. Encouraging you to bridge out and expand your consciousness. Or these other islands may be reached only via finding a connection to them in the overworld, perhaps hidden in dungeons created by another mod, or only available after defeating a Boss mob. In which you enter their psyche and see what their mind is truly like. This could allow for all sorts of storyline and gameplay revelations.   Cons:   It's still cumbersome and slower than regular minecraft. You're basically replacing your cursor with your character. Many will be turned off by this idea, but that's okay, not everyone likes bees either but some people do. This mod would need to be well executed and somewhat popular to justify other mod makers creating add ons to it or accommodating it.     Alright, that's all I got for now."
Proasheck,20qx2d,Avenged7fold,2,Wed Mar 19 23:59:28 2014 UTC,"Yay, feedback! :D   It seems like you're complaining about how parts of minecraft are tedious and thus make it boring, so your solution is to make it 100 times more tedius. (Slight clarification: I think Minecraft gameplay has been done to death, thus the parts that aren't showing off players' creativity are boring.)   I wanted to see how this was received first, but I think I'll look at doing a more finished proposal with some gameplay stories to better communicate what's in my head. It isn't my intention to make moving a bit of dirt some massive undertaking no matter how long you've been playing the game, but since I didn't really elaborate on anything but the small picture I can see how I failed to get that across.   And it completely removes it's ability to play well with other mods. First, I'll admit to having control issues, so a part of me doesn't care: It's my way or the highway, buster! :p   That said, for everyone else's sake I'd do everything I could to have it work nicely anyway: Other mods would just be running ""Vanilla Mode"" while Vanilla Minecraft and whatever is ""Mod Compatible"" would use the new system. Hell, I'll even add a backpack slot for the babbies to store their custom mountains in. :p j/k   Removing the usage of the GUI... I meant this more as a design-philosophy, and even then a flexible one: I wouldn't somehow ""block"" other mods from using the UI, nor did I plan to be ultra hard-line against using the UI if I couldn't come up with something that added to the game. I just think it breaks the ""world-building"" idea when used unnecessarily, and is a bit of a design crutch that cripples mods that could have been really neat if they hadn't used it.   Oh, and thanks for taking the time to write all that! It really helps to know I'm not just doing this for myself. :)"

Proasheck,20i8zm,Victarus,7,Sat Mar 15 21:18:38 2014 UTC,"I agree, Minecraft to me has never been about the game itself, but rather the people playing it and the scenarios they create for themselves if that makes sense. You don't watch Sips and Sjin to see them build the most efficient wind turbine setup and make a quarry for the 20th time, you watch them for the conversations they have about random nonsense while the game acts to drive things forward."
Proasheck,20i8zm,ginkaa,2,Sat Mar 15 23:43:31 2014 UTC,"I definitely agree about Sips (and, honestly, I think Sips & Hat Films has been just as good if not better to watch), but for most groups I think the game is still important, if only because their commentary isn't as constantly strong (Sips' random topics and tangents help him a lot in this department). Having that occasional ""story"" element (and I use that term very loosely) thrown in both helps keep my interest and also enhances their banter, since a lot of the more entertaining discussions tend to be about things that are going on in the game.  Which kind of leads into the problem with Minecraft series: Unless there's some really unique mod element, some story thing going on, or they're just doing ""Lego talk"" while idle, the video is people talking about Minecraft while playing Minecraft, making it a let's play of a game that's been done to death."

Proasheck,205lag,TheCyberTronn,3,Tue Mar 11 19:04:20 2014 UTC,"I guess to give an idea of what I'm looking for, here's a scenario I think would be neat:  Rythian has an isolated castle deep in the desert where dangerous energies have sapped the land of life, but made the area rich in magical power. He mostly relies on magical automatons to do work since villagers refuse to work there. There are also plenty of gems buried deep underground, perfect for rituals and trading.  Zoey shares the same site but her ""home"" is an underground river that's deep enough to be spared from the worst of the magic's effects. She taps into the same magical energy as Rythian to create an underground lair teeming with life, but may one day face trouble if the river's source begins to try up...  Sips & Sjin support themselves as a travelling construction company, with Sjin as the architect and Sips handling the business/negotiation side of things. They also have a modest facility where they continuously swap between different trades — gathering materials one week, providing housing for villagers the next.  Duncan has his lab in an area rich with rare materials needed for advanced machinery — uranium, osmium, etc. When he isn't working with another group, he supports himself by selling and repairing advanced machines."

Proasheck,1zsutq,Staggitarius,3,Fri Mar 7 11:11:19 2014 UTC,"I know we all want to think we can help Zoey's money problems, but I don't think we can. We're the installed viewer base. We're the ones watching her and giving her the (small amount of) money she's currently getting.  Making more money is in Zoey's hands and hers alone. She has to push out content and get more people to subscribe to her. And I'm sure she knows how to get it done."
Proasheck,1zsutq,JamSa,3,Sat Mar 8 02:29:15 2014 UTC,"I went through my computers statistics (or whatever you wanna call it) and mathed for a bit, according to my computer and my math my misclicking ads has earned Zoey alone approve  £2000... I misclick, a LOT, and to make it better, when I exit the website it sent me to in order to play the ad so it can finish or I can skip I click the ad AGAIN, repeat process approx 100 times (I really wish I was over exaggerating that) PER VIDEO"
Proasheck,1zsutq,Avenged7fold,3,Fri Mar 7 12:01:37 2014 UTC,"unfortunately, Youtube has algorithms against click-spamming so your best efforts are probably in vain...  For those interested in an order of magnitude estimation of what Zoey makes from her videos:  Youtube pays per 1000 views (more for clicked ads, but those generally pale in comparison as hardly anyone clicks those). How much you get per 1000 views is called your CPM and it varies widly from a few cents to several dollars. From the numbers I've heard I'd expected a channel like Zoeys (gaming related, part of the yogscast) to get around 4$ CPM, but it could be a lot more or less.  Luckily for us, we can check our estimation a little. Nilsey has recently gone full-time. If we assume he gets the same CPM as Zoey and went full-time when he started making a bit above the median UK income   According to this Nilsey would need about $3 CPM to make 30k (British pounds) a year before taxes. Not too far off from our estimate.  Using this we can estimate Zoeys gross income (ignoring adBlock) to be about $1.6k a month. That being said, we can be off in our estimate of the CPM by a lot, so she could make only $1k or she could make $2.5k just aswell.   I don't live in the UK but judging from the wiki page, this would put Zoey in the position where (after AdBlock) she makes enough to live off of, but not by much. And given the ever declining CPM on youtube and heavilly fluctuating nature of YT income I can understand where she is coming from and urge everyone to turn off AdBlock.   ..Now I feel like a stalker ._.'"

Ultimately the game is the stage for the actor to express oneself. Most people don't watch it for the game, they watch it to see the person or people in the video perform.

Again, I don't mean actual scary-looking masks and costumes. :)  You could do it together with Fiona - do something ""like vlogs"" - both of you fancily dressed in such a way, both with nice fancy carnival masks, probably different - but equally covering.  Not sure if the idea is something you might like, or if that would even help - but anyway, I thought I'd voice the thought I had.  Approached with imagination and thought - this may be a nicely doable thing to implement - it could even be ""themed"" to go along with some occasion or something - although getting equally-awesome-looking, but different costumes, for separate occasions, for two people each time, could be a hassle, so that we'll have to be looked at...  But... Anyway - you might have explored such an idea already - but if it may be something to your liking, maybe it'll inspire something.

I don't know how good they'd be, or how possible they'd be to implement, but I can come up with some things.  Uh. One mushroom will have a special drop from it's blocks (about the same drop rate as apples from oak trees) that when fused with a carrot and fed to a horse, will make a mushroom horse. These mushroom horses are faster and jump higher.  Mushroom armor as some have said.  Mushroom doors, stairs, fences, etc. generic house stuff really.  Rainbow mushroom sword which can only be obtained from the rainbow mushroom (a rarity by itself). The rainbow mushroom would have a 3X3X3 stalk. In the middle of the mushroom will be a block that when broken will give you the sword.  A magical mushroom that will let you build the mushroom staff. When you right click on a block with the mushroom staff, a mushroom will be placed down (excluding the magic mushroom and rainbow mushroom).  I think this may have been suggested, but the ability to build a mushroom portal to mushroom land, this land is populated by stronger mushroom monsters, and has it's own mushroom boss, the mushwither.  Yeah, those ideas enough?"

Proasheck,1ypkmf,adude350,3,Mon Feb 24 11:25:44 2014 UTC,Well one thing to consider is if you hold out til 1.74 mods then Twitch streaming is built in. The 1.72 versions of mods are filtering out now and I don't think there will be much changed between 1.72 and 1.74 so if you hold off til 1.72 you should be able to update to 1.74 without any issue and get the best of both.

If the BlueXephos channel ahd recieved two more strikes (Eg, Form this Way and Screw the Nether), the channel would have been taken down, no ifs or buts. Taking the music down was the best option fir the Yogscast from a business PoV. Reuploading them could only give grounds for companies to claim copyright infringement against Yogscast Ltd.

Forum moderator, forum admin for the semi-official main Ridgearound forum community, server moderator for the semi-official and server admin for the main official Minecraft Ridgearound servers. Solid experience with communities both in various chats and forums. Previous experience as an active member on other forums, including but not limited to GameSpot and Silkroadforums. I'm good at cleaning communities and keeping them clean. I am strict when needed but never too strict; I am fair, I am playful. I invest in the communities I am part of. I enjoy a friendly, open, fun loving but serious when needed- community and this is what I work towards. A fun and safe place. Can be strict but always fair. I believe there are times when rules have to be applied strictly, but there, depending on the set community guidelines and atmosphere, can be times for goofing around. I adapt accordingly and embrace the preset rules. I like to think a mod isn't (just) there to enforce the rules, but to preserve the health of the community. Rules are just part of this ongoing process. I am new to reddit. I have read around every now and then, but never signed up until now, because someone may or may not have made me :33 But it seems like a fun place, and if the community is fun, I will invest heavily into it, and if it becomes a voluntary job, officially or unofficially, even moreso.

Skyrim vanilla has a particular quirk when it comes to height. Specifically, height is a multiplier for a character's damage which is normally not noticable cause players are within a small 0.1 range. If the mod didn't find a workaround to this however, Zoey essentially would have had a completely gimped character that really wouldn't be able to do much cause it was so short if the series continued with it."

However, Fiona Fight Fridays are almost definitely going to happen. Not for a few months while we get set up together, but definitely this year.  Pokémon will always be a thing on my channel, but I won't have more than one Poké-thing at a time. Expect nuzlockes or something once my story is complete.

Proasheck,1uplvd,AcesulfameZ,4,Wed Jan 8 19:43:52 2014 UTC,I love most of the ideas. My only concern is the Minecraft Pokémon.

Proasheck,1uplvd,Asurnasurpal,3,Wed Jan 8 22:50:33 2014 UTC,I would love a Fallout mod playthrough! (Wait is it a playthrough or just showing of differend mods)?

Maybe a playthrough of modded Morrowind or Black Mesa? ...Wait that's even more ideas. (Sorry).

Proasheck,1uplvd,Nanowith,3,Wed Jan 8 15:47:34 2014 UTC,"Along with Pokemon X I would love to see a competitive Pokemon series (where you could also explain some of the finer points in the battles such as how nature's affect attacks, etc). This would be a great one to do alongside Pokemon X because they both have to do with each other and we could get a bit more knowledge on your playthrough of Pokemon X. The third thing I would love to see with those other two would be you drawing! It would be fun and it could almost be a hybrid drawing/vlog type video.  For the second 'grouping' of games it would be great to see Starbound along with the fight games with Fiona. I have to agree with the others about Fallout: New Vegas being a little old but if it makes you happy playing it then I'm sure all of us would enjoy watching it!"
Proasheck,1uplvd,Staggitarius,3,Wed Jan 8 17:21:00 2014 UTC,"I love the idea of FiFridayFight, that sounds brilliant.  The Y nuzlockes/wonderlocks sound like fun, but I wouldn't want them to detract from the main series, so maybe after X is finished?  Personally I reeeeally want Zoey to continue Moddowind, partly 'cus it's one of my favourite games of all time, but my computer's too slow to run it with mods. Plus the first episode was great, so I want more.  Vlogs and drawing sound cool too, I'd watch them."

Proasheck,1uplvd,Thatgamingguy,3,Thu Jan 9 01:00:23 2014 UTC,"Well, I think New Vegas is probably past it's prime. It's already been out for a few years and it wouldn't have the greatest chance for success.   Fight Nights With Fiona, or anything with Fiona would do well. You work well together and people love her.   Unfinished Series' always carry the weight of the past. I would either drop them entirely or finish them before attempting anything else.  Vlogs always do well, especially when they tell something worthwhile.   Anything related to Half-Life usually dose well, but it depends on the mod and content creator.   Story-Based Games are variable, they could make a good series or they could be poop. It depends on the viewers, commentator, and game story.   Only one Pokemon series at a time makes sense.  Ultimately I don't care. I love Zoey no matter what she puts out or how often she puts it out.   Good day! -Puppydudley"

Proasheck,1ud0pa,Enragedlime,1 point,Sat Jan 4 04:27:31 2014 UTC,"The way you can tell is based a lot on the lyrics and instruments, rock and roll tends to be things like drugs and sex and stuff, whereas metal tends to be darker and deeper, also, rock and roll has a happier sound to it and takes a while less to learn how to play on most instrumets, whereas metal is the kind of thing you would spend more time learning, instruments are of more importance in metal than in rock and roll, as the term ""heavy metal"" refers to the fact that they would have more a bit more instrumental (typically metally instruments like drums, and electric guitar/bass) parts. You can also tell by the appearance of the artists normally, sleeve tattoos, dark colours, and basically everything about black veiled brides plus sleeve tattoos point to the fact they would be metal/screemo, where rock and roll artists tend to wear everything but that. Also, win rock and roll, if you where to play one instrument or only sing, it would still sound good, whereas with metal, it wouldn't sound so great (with exception of guitar, as guitar as the part of metal that everything sounds worse without. Therefore has to sound good on its own. And heavy metal guitars tend to be raunchy and louder than that in rock and roll, and solos are more in metal.    Examples, rock and roll: Elvis Presley and many, many (so many) more   Heavy metal: ACDC, Metallica, etc   Death metal: Black veiled brides, Avenged Sevenfold (Shut up my account is a year and a half old), etc"

Proasheck,1tfitd,ChrisCousland,2,Sun Dec 22 19:54:24 2013 UTC,"I'll tell you what I really liked about it, and that was the overall atmosphere. I'll explain: I've been watching Zoey's stuff for the past year or so, and I've enjoyed what I've seen, especially the novelty of having the storylines mixed in with everything. But the stream last night felt different. Since Zoey was just playing games to muck around and have a laugh she seemed ... more relaxed in a way. At least, I thought I could feel a tangible difference between some of her vids where she was maybe a little nervous; and the laid-back manner of the stream. Whether this was down to Fiona being there or whether it was more linked to the fact that she wasn't sticking to a ""script"" (can't think of a better word!) I'm not sure, but I loved it! I was drawn in, and it felt like I was watching 2 people just enjoying themselves because they wanted to rather than doing a stream for charity.  I hope maybe we can have some more laid-back vids from Zoey in the future (I loved the TF2 Final!) and I'll be sure to stick around to see what happens!  TL;DR - Laid-back fun Zoey is cool!"

Zoey makes the best videos, and is going to have the best stream! I absolutely know it! (regardless of how much she works on it)"
Proasheck,1sr5e0,JamSa,11,Thu Dec 12 23:27:04 2013 UTC,"Yeah, we tend to take these things for granted, but it is a lot of work she puts into her videos and I can see how it can be very stressful when a lot of people expect a video from you every single day.  What she maybe doesn't realize is that we would watch and love anything she puts on her channel. Including a full playthrough of Barbie's Dreamhouse Party :P"
Proasheck,1sr5e0,TheDan7933,12,Thu Dec 12 23:42:55 2013 UTC,"Zoey, every time I see you in another video... I love it! Everyone in the yogscast is different and that's just what makes you guys awesome. I saw you in Parv's livestream during Dota 2, you were a great addition and brought the stream some of the magic Proasheck touch that it needed. Your addition in the Blackrock livestream made me literally COUNT DOWN THE DAYS TO THE 21ST, because I CAN NOT wait for your livestream. You and Rythian made me and thousands of other people laugh at some points in the Blackrock livestream (you dirty troll, you). Never worry about ruining anyone elses videos, Zoey. I remember I used to worry about it in some of my cousins videos. Mainly, I was worried that I would ruin it for him (because I'd already done that in a survival island series that we did years ago). In the end, I was just being myself and eventually I didn't worry about what I said or did. You wouldn't be RUINING the video, you'd be making it BETTER because you are AWESOME. Never forget it."
Proasheck,1sr5e0,thijsje656,5,Fri Dec 13 00:04:13 2013 UTC,"Zoey, you would make any serie more awesome! we all love you, and you're amazing! you wouldn't ruin it in any bit. the people from the yogscast as i've seen them are very supportive and nice. so don't worry  lots of love from holland!"
Proasheck,1sr5e0,Puppydudley,3,Fri Dec 13 00:00:58 2013 UTC,"I can see why she'd be fearful. She's so different (In a good way!) to the others, there's a good chance the chemistry to make the video work just wouldn't be there. That's not to say I wouldn't like to see her work with someone, it would certainly help to expand her subscriber base. With that being said, the content she produces and the audience she tries so hard to appeal to, it's probably best if her community stays small."
Proasheck,1sr5e0,Puppydudley,2,Fri Dec 13 14:51:57 2013 UTC,"In their most recent Starbound video, Lewis and Duncan mentioned the possibility of getting other yogs involved and Zoey's name came up. I think with the enthusiasm she showed for the game during the Blackrock stream, it would be a perfect game to play with the other members."
Proasheck,1sr5e0,TheDan7933,2,Fri Dec 13 14:59:05 2013 UTC,"I agree, it would be the perfect outlet for her to get used to coop with other YOGS. With that said, social anxiety is a motherfucker. I know that most of the Yogscast record several episodes in one session, if they planned on doing a series, Zoey would have to be active and vocal on camera for several hours at a time. With social anxiety, that's a bitch even off camera, and that's what she's probably worried about."
Proasheck,1sr5e0,yreg,1 point,Fri Dec 13 15:34:04 2013 UTC,"Exactly. Starbound is a game that allows for perfect levels of creativity, and as Zoey said in this post, as soon as character wipes are a thing of the past we can expect a galaxy spanning mushroom village of (presumably) epic proportions.  I, for one, can't wait. :D Stay positive, everybody, we may just be blowing things out of proportion over here."

Proasheck,1rvd3i,Kalse1229,3,Mon Dec 2 03:00:10 2013 UTC,Nuclear Fallout  If you're saying Sips is the least friendly I might disagree a little. I think Sips is friendly but he's one of those people who like to jokingly make fun of their friends and considering Zoey's anxiety but I'm not sure how bad that is.  Also I wonder what could even be a game they'd both enjoy.

Proasheck,1raux1,Clarewells,2,Sat Nov 23 19:59:50 2013 UTC,"I guess I can see things differently for the purpose of this conversation, Blackrock seems corny, like a soap opera or something, however, a majority of its fanbase is there because it's that way (why do you think so many people like Twilight?). I haven't watched moonquest but I can take your word for it that it's comical and fun. Others won't be as nice as I was as a response to your opinion, but I just pointed out to you, why that is. People just simply love the series, and you can't change that. (If your flare is serious and you are depressed and it's not a joke, just remember: keep on keepin on, but even if you're not depressed, keep on keepin on)"

I feel since this game came out during the holiday season, you'll probably end up with a lot of people getting it for Christmas, and may be in the same situation as me. I'll need to remember to come back to this after I play."
Proasheck,1r8mzo,Meno_Self,1 point,Fri Nov 22 22:00:35 2013 UTC,Don't worry. It's only one episode and it barely covers anything. It's essentially the tutorial dungeon and about a minute of story. It doesn't show anything that wasn't already shown in gameplay trailers.
Proasheck,1r8mzo,definitelynotzoey,7,Fri Nov 22 22:04:51 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I quite like this style I'm discovering where I can just do quick one-off videos of random games, and not particularly go in to it in any great depth, but still give a little taste of it and add my commentary. Hope you all enjoy it too!"
Proasheck,1r8mzo,Meno_Self,2,Fri Nov 22 23:36:30 2013 UTC,I think it's a great style to be honest that would work well with a lot of games (mostly ones that aren't too tutorial heavy and get to the meat of the game fairly quickly).

Now, I'm fairly certain you won't take what I just wrote seriously. It's hard to look at compliments when you're feeling so down and acknowledge them as genuine. Trust me, I know. But I really do mean it. You're a fantastic person who deserves to be happy. We all deserve to be happy.   So take some time. Figure out what it is you need to make yourself happy again. It could be anything! Talking to a counsellor, taking an hour out of your day to do something that you really enjoy, finding a de-stressor (e.g. yoga), anything. Do try and take that first step even though it's difficult, and know that no matter what, there is always someone out there who cares about you (I care! :D). But don't think I'm pressuring you. Work with whatever time frame feels comfortable. I just want you to be happy again.  And yes, I know that it's super easy to dismiss what some random stranger on the internet says. The truth is, I don't have all the answers and I certainly don't have a quick fix for being depressed. It's a hard thing to deal with, and worst of all it's cyclical. Our sadness causes us to be cruel to ourselves, which only serves to make us more upset.  Again, you're a really special person. And I hope that one day soon, you'll realize it too."

I still feel worthless though. :(  I'll never amount to people like Zoey.

You have to be brave to do that. And bravery is awesome!  And don't forget, Zoey was in your position once. If she can overcome her fear, her anxiety, her depression, who's to say that you can't overcome this? No one, that's who. I believe in you.  And most importantly, you're not nothing, you're special. I can't stress this enough. You're not selfish and you're not greedy. Trust me. I've met a lot of selfish and greedy people in my life, and you're nothing like them.  But again, I know that it's really hard to take these kind of comments seriously when you're sad. So if you take anything away from what I've written here, let it be that I know you're super awesome, just like Zoey! <3"

Proasheck,1p1nqv,definitelynotzoey,3,Wed Oct 23 13:48:06 2013 UTC,"Honestly, I would dislike it if Zoey's livestreams, reddit page and youtube channel started having a lot of people. Everyone on the livestream was so nice! So if zoey were to have an explosion of fans; it just wouldn't be the same because of the massive amount of trolls running around. And because of the large amount of people there would be a lack of communication, such as having about 10 thousand people watching the livestream commenting at once or the reddit page being flooded. Does anyone else understand what I'm trying to say here? I like the good lookins community as it is, and it doesn't seem as if trolls are much of an issue right now"
Proasheck,1p1nqv,WellsHG,2,Thu Oct 24 22:07:33 2013 UTC,"Yeah, the issues with a large population comes to mind whenever I find people for the community. But with that being said, it is what Zoey wants & it doesn't seem right to deprive people of their potential friends."

I find it pretty shitty that you posted that amazing video expressing everything I had hoped this community to be, and then have Simon take pop shots at 9-11."
Proasheck,1p1nqv,WellsHG,23,Wed Oct 23 21:02:58 2013 UTC,"I am not Simon, my channel is not BlueXephos. The Yogscast is full of diverse and unique personalities, channels, and senses of humor. Please do not assume what happens on one channel is a reflection of all others."
Proasheck,1p1nqv,JamSa,-18,Thu Oct 24 00:35:47 2013 UTC,"I'm not saying it is a reflection or your channel..quite the contrary I am saying that Simon's comments flies in the face of everything you stand for...and it is a damn shame.  I really really hope that the communities response of everything can be made fun because it can be considered a ""joke"", does not translate into people feeling free to ""joke"" around with you. THAT is my worry in terms of here/you."
Proasheck,1p1nqv,pyro_archvile,6,Thu Oct 24 02:02:47 2013 UTC,"So you go and do the exact same thing I highlighted as the problem? You trolls are too alike. This is what I'm talking about, people like you make people feel insecure and leave worse off than they where originally.    Now to expand on Zoey's comment, she's right, The Yogscast are people which means they're going to differ.   And my third solid point, I never once said anything about the main community or other channels, this post was intended only for Zoey's separate community."
Proasheck,1p1nqv,WellsHG,-12,Thu Oct 24 00:46:15 2013 UTC,"That doesn't even make sense. If you wanted to criticize me for dragging cross channel stuff over..than fine, but I am not ""trolling"".  I am saying that Zoey has done her very best to espouse what you have said..A safe, friendly, community, but when Simon purposefully attempts to ""hurt"" others it takes away from that. Like it or not, by flying under the same ""flag"" as it were they ARE linked.  The reason I brought it up here is because after Zoey made that amazing, and heartfelt video tons of people praised her for it..about her struggles with anxiety, and being gay, and depression. I had apparently falsely thought Zoey's community WAS the Yogcast community..Apparently I was wrong..Apparently the ""Yogcast"" community thinks its the height of comedy to mock the pain of 9-11.  Which BTW..opens the floodgates for the trolls you are ""ranting"" against..You see it is related to this thread because Simon has defacto set an example for how fans should act..what is or isn't off limits..and that includes the trolls that will be commenting on her videos.  Call me a troll or anything else you want..It isn't going to change the fact that if you want a nicer, kinder community maybe belittling people associated with 9-11 isnt a good way to start..and Zoey WILL unfortunately almost certainly pay a price for limits being broken."
Proasheck,1p1nqv,Chimp96,4,Thu Oct 24 01:52:47 2013 UTC,"9/11 was twelve years ago. People from every city, every state, and every country has been making jokes about it for years now. Everybody else can leave it in the past, you should as well. ""A dick has hit the second tower"" that's pretty funny, beside that if we can't recover and laugh at the work of a terrorist and continue to fear them, they've won.  Second: Every member of The Yogscast has their own community in addition to the main community pages. Zoey's community is usually kind and uplifting people. The different fan bases have different behaviors often similar to the community 'leader'.   Third: Zoey wasn't apart of that series, nor has she ever mentioned 9/11. You cannot blame her for something she didn't do."
Proasheck,1p1nqv,WellsHG,-7,Thu Oct 24 02:16:44 2013 UTC,Please read my other response. I am in no way blaming Zoey for anything..I don't even know how you could possibly be construing that from that I have posted..
Proasheck,1p1nqv,Chimp96,7,Thu Oct 24 02:43:56 2013 UTC,"If you're not trying to blame Zoey, then why is this even coming up on her subreddit? Why would you use it to try and get your point across? The joke was funny, very funny. They had not intention of offending those who still considered 9/11 a recent disaster and therefor off limits.   I truly am sorry if you where affected by 9/11, I was too young to remember it."

Reddit alone has many places to go where you can tell your story and receive support from other people who have gone/are going through the same things as you. I'm sure you know that talking about your problems should help a little. Don't know how to start(if it's a problem)? Just start. Don't care about how terrible it is, because people will understand. I'm sure you're thinking something along the lines of, ""What does this asshole think they know about me? Why the hell do they think they can help?"" Well... I don't know. I don't know you personally, I probably never will. I don't even know if what I've written will help you, or if it will simply made you feel worse. I sat here for a half hour debating this. I certainly hope you get some comfort in some stranger taking the time taking a good amount of time writing this in the hope it makes you feel better, but hey this whole ""tender caring"" kind of thing isn't my strong suit. I'm no shrink, I'm just some 16 year old typing at their iPod. I have very little experience in helping people, but I hate seeing sadness. In fact the only person I can say I helped was a guy who was rejected by the girl he liked.

Proasheck,1oljgc,Electro522,2,Wed Oct 16 21:32:43 2013 UTC,"Considering the first Pokémon drawn was a Pikachu, and th second was Krabby, this one could honestly be anything, since it is just a ball.  If you were you going for traditionally shaped Pokémon, I would say Voltorb or Electrode. However, since you are shaping the Pokémon differently, I'm going to go out on a whim, and say Onix."
Proasheck,1oljgc,DuckUmbrella,1 point,Wed Oct 16 23:30:20 2013 UTC,zoey! swap out chou from the first slot and put chou or birdfacé in front so they can train up to be as powerful as chou is!

Proasheck,1ok5cl,Electro522,9,Wed Oct 16 06:55:16 2013 UTC,"While there are many areas of content post-beating the Elite Four, I would probably play until beating the Elite Four. So, still a full 'story' playthrough, but not necessarily showing off absolutely each and every area in the game.  The first couple episodes have been slow, and I don't want non-pokemon fans to lose interest, so by speeding up or cutting grindy wild battles, every episode from now should have a much better pace and flow. I'm thinking it will take approximately 30-40 episodes. A nice full series, without it dragging on and pointlessly spending episodes just battling Pidgeys."

Proasheck,1oj0y6,THCW,1 point,Wed Oct 16 05:28:55 2013 UTC,"Hey Zoey, loving the playthrough so far! I do have a little suggestion for you to make the playthrough better: when you get the Exp. Share, immediately turn it off and don't use it. It's been tweaked in such a way that it makes you ridiculously over-powered to the point where the game serves no challenge whatsoever. My little brother used it and his entire team of six was roughly twenty levels higher than the seventh Gym Leader's team.   It's just a suggestion obviously, and people may disagree with this, but I think it would make the series more interesting and allow you to get the most out of the game if you don't use it."
Proasheck,1oj0y6,definitelynotzoey,3,Tue Oct 15 21:31:40 2013 UTC,"Yeah I knew about this beforehand and I will likely be turning it off, as you suggest, to make each Pokémon feel more unique and special. If the next time you saw Birdfacé was when it was suddenly at level 20 and a Pidgeotto, it would lose all meaning of the bond formed between me and my team. The Exp. Share is great for quick and casual playthroughs, but for one where I actually want to connect to my team and make the audience root for each one individually, I'll most likely be turning it off!"

There are sad things in this world, and I'm prepared to see these things. Though I didn't feel sad myself when Zoey was talking about her past, I sympathised. What made me cry was that she turned it around. She makes thousands happy, and doing that makes her happy. It's important to feel loved, and even if you don't in your current situation, you can at least know you make her happy. It's an incredibly nice feeling mutual happiness, and I want to keep experiencing it. And the nature of it means I want others to feel mutual happiness too no-matter any background.

Proasheck,1o8l4k,Staggitarius,1 point,Sat Oct 12 07:26:47 2013 UTC,"It's not a magic switch where suddenly everything is just rainbows and kittens. It takes effort. A WHOLE lot of effort and fighting and some days are always gonna be bad.   You also need to believe in yourself and to want to be happy again.   You have love yourself again.   Be proud of who you are.  Meaning is not something that is given on its own.   Sometimes you need to give something meaning even when it does not.  You have to ask yourself who you are, what do you want?  Before you even think of committing suicide, think of the people whose lives you have affected. Over the course of your life, it adds up, even if it does not feel like it. You would be deeply missed by those who love you, who would have to cope with your permanent absence after you are gone. You are never alone. There are people who love you. I love you. We would miss you and grieve for you forever.  Channel your feelings onto a medium. Be it a song, a poem or a diary. It will help you understand yourself better. Then, share what you've come up with with someone you trust. Be it a neighbour, a best friend or even /r/Proasheck.  Face your fears. You may be having suicidal thoughts for some time or maybe they've recently snuck up on you. Certain people or events might trigger dark thoughts. It is totally normal to feel sadness from painful experiences. BUT it is not healthy to spiral into a suicidal mindset and believe that death is the only solution to ending this pain.  In fact, the belief that suicide is the only way out, might be linked to something else, like depression. Like a disease at work in your own body, the illness is treatable. Are the anti-depressants really the cause of poor memory? Lifestyle choices like lack of sleep or poor diet would lead to similar symptoms. I once was stranded in the wilderness for 20 days. I slept very little when I was lost and I could barely remember who I was when I got back to civilisation.  Suicidal thoughts aren't treatable. But the illnesses associated with them are. If you really do think that the anti-depressants are the cause of poor memory, seek help from your psychiatrist about how you feel about the medication. If you don't like the psychiatrist you see at first, it's okay to keep looking for one that does genuinely help your situation. There are many methods with counseling. Find out what works best for you.  If you require more assistance, please call any of the numbers in the list from this website: Norwegian Suicide Hotlines  Keep on keeping on, and remember that you are important!"

I've never heard of this Minercfat game but it seems pretty popular...  And Magic diary with those wacky voices...  No matter what we are going to get something good...
