melbourne,3e1h8b,qartas,23,Tue Jul 21 05:55:27 2015 UTC,Myki machines belong on /r/firstworldanarchists
melbourne,3e1h8b,stinx2001,21,Tue Jul 21 06:14:48 2015 UTC,"Is it your EFT receipt?  AFAIK, You can deny the MYKI receipt, but if you EFT over an amount, they are required to print one. Same reason you can't deny the self serve machines at Coles / Woolies over a threshold amount."
melbourne,3e1h8b,Akira675,12,Tue Jul 21 07:10:54 2015 UTC,Suppliers must provide proof of transaction to consumers for goods or services valued at $75 (excluding GST) or more.    They're required to do so for 75 or more.   For transactions at Woolies (not sure about Coles) the system asks if you want a receipt for purchases under 30 (except when a collectables promotion is running) to save paper on low value purchases.   Source: worked in Woolworths supermarket operations
melbourne,3e1h8b,rawrtiger,7,Tue Jul 21 09:03:26 2015 UTC,I've had it for EFT topups as low as $10
melbourne,3e1h8b,SteelOverseer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:55:53 2015 UTC,Agreed. I've had it for low topups too.   From memory if you do want a receipt two pieces of paper appear...It's been a while though.
melbourne,3e1h8b,PLEASE_PM_UR_COCK,10,Tue Jul 21 13:29:59 2015 UTC,My theory is somewhere in the PPP contract for Myki is an amazing sub-clause for a paper supplier.
melbourne,3e1h8b,FreakySpook,2,Tue Jul 21 07:06:29 2015 UTC,Probably something in the ongoing maintenance of the top up machines. Roll of receipt paper = $200 to have someone come out and change (obviously speculation and possible exaggeration). Also when it runs out of paper it probably goes down meaning people can't top up and either sign up for auto top-up or get tickets for getting on the train anyway.
melbourne,3e1h8b,natostrike,4,Tue Jul 21 07:50:13 2015 UTC,"That's why I only use cash, don't trust Myki with any of my data.  Especially after this story."
melbourne,3e1h8b,natostrike,2,Tue Jul 21 07:49:33 2015 UTC,"Cash has its own problems.  If, for whatever reason, the credit doesn't apply to your card and swallows your cash, you'll run into trouble trying to prove you attempted to top with x amount."
melbourne,3e1h8b,razor_cat,2,Tue Jul 21 11:11:29 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is why I always get a receipt. Happened to me. I paid cash. Machine took cash. Machine didn't credit my card."

I called the police and they said dexies won't come up on the test because they're synthetic amphetamine and not street amphetamine. Ritalin has no chance at all of coming up on the test but if you're worried keep a copy of the prescription in your car.

Driving is their livelihood, if they get stuck in traffic for 30mins with no fare, that's 30mins worth of wages gone. Most Uber drivers do it for extra income on the weekends or during uni or work breaks. If they miss a fare, that's few extra dollar not saved, a few beers not bought. As a regular Uber user, I have yet to meet someone who relies on Uber as their main sources of income."

melbourne,3dwzur,Hygienic_Sucrose,4,Mon Jul 20 11:14:43 2015 UTC,Here in Mexico apparently Uber drivers do rely on this job to sustain themselves. Being that they either own the vehicle or just are drivers for some guys who owns and rents his cars. And they say they get good money out of it.
melbourne,3dwzur,Alexiel17,6,Mon Jul 20 14:08:24 2015 UTC,"Most Uber drivers do it for extra income on the weekends or during uni or work breaks. If they miss a fare, that's few extra dollar not saved, a few beers not bought.   I get the thought process here, but understand that to us drivers, that's still uncompensated work for us. Not only that, but every mile we drive and minute we idle costs us gas, maintenance, and capital depreciation, so driving to a fare that cancels or otherwise failing to get a ride puts us in the red, and we need to claw back from that.  Driving for Uber in addition to another job doesn't mean that it isn't ""real money"" to me, nor that it shouldn't be regarded with the same dignity as any other work. Lots of people have a part time second job by necessity. It's what will hopefully keep me from getting evicted this month.  Sending your Uber driver on a wild goose chase for a half hour is like sneaking out of a restaurant without paying the check. It's a punch in the gut that incurs real costs for someone. What does it matter what the money was going to be used for? We don't allow store managers to short employees their pay if they feel that the worker in question doesn't ""really need"" the money. The statement that some types of work aren't ""real jobs"" is insulting, and also self-fulfilling. The perception of certain workers as exploitable feeds on itself and leads to further abuse."

melbourne,3dwzur,TheDmac,6,Mon Jul 20 07:10:02 2015 UTC,How safe is Uber? Never used it before.
melbourne,3dwzur,ultrasargent,23,Mon Jul 20 13:41:23 2015 UTC,There are so many checks and balances that it's incredibly safe.
melbourne,3dwzur,405freeway,45,Mon Jul 20 13:45:02 2015 UTC,"I've been threatened, intimidated, and harassed.. by cab drivers.  I call and complain, and get nothing.  This can never happen with Uber.  There is a user feedback mechanism where you rate the driver after every drive, and if they go below something like a 4.7 out of 5 stars, they get kicked off the platform and can't drive anymore.  If you give a driver 4 out of 5 stars, you'll have Uber contacting you asking what they could have done better, and will likely get a full refund and apology.  Seriously though, Uber is 100% awesome people.  The shitheads get thrown to the curb super quick."
melbourne,3dwzur,px403,10,Mon Jul 20 14:24:12 2015 UTC,How do you know if the driver is safe if it's their first time?
melbourne,3dwzur,latman,11,Mon Jul 20 14:29:35 2015 UTC,"Most new drivers are super paranoid about getting 5 stars for every ride early on to build up their rating, so they're a lot more cautious.  If you're living in an area that has had Uber for over a year or so though, it's pretty unlikely that you'll ride with many first time drivers.  My area just got Uber, so I've had it happen twice in maybe 100+ rides, but they were both awesome.  Maybe they had to fiddle with the app a bit more since it was their first time using it, but they figured it out, and were both really fun to talk to."

melbourne,3dwzur,Shyguy8413,3,Mon Jul 20 15:50:57 2015 UTC,"I visited San Fran back in 2010ish and Uber was just becoming really popular. I thought it was an amazing idea, but didn't fully realise the difference between it and a standard taxi firm.  One night me and my host got a ride downtown. Host was convinced they took an obscure longer route so rated them slightly less than normal. Had Uber calling him within half an hour enquiring what happened and analysing the route taken. Fully refunded and immense apologies were given.  I haven't had a chance to try out Uber here in Leeds in the UK yet, but to be completely honest, they just look like a standard dodgy taxi firm but with the Uber logo slapped on the door. I genuinely can't imagine the same response. If you complain like that here with normal taxis, you get your number black listed and they don't pick up the next time you call."
melbourne,3dwzur,nostalgiamon,4,Mon Jul 20 15:02:51 2015 UTC,"The taxis here are like how you describe they are in Leeds.  I've only done Uber in the US, but I would be really surprised if customer service was less responsive outside of the US, especially in the UK."
melbourne,3dwzur,px403,2,Mon Jul 20 15:07:01 2015 UTC,"Customer service here in the UK as a general rule is pitiful. There's even a car hire company ad going around at the moment with the slogan ""UK car hire, US customer service."" Unless a company goes out of their way to be an upper-market and obviously states that customer service is a big part of their deal (and not even then) customer's are treated like utter shit in the UK, whether that's energy companies, shops etc. The biggest exception to that rule is probably restaurants, but even then they do not have the constant-smile-on-your-face-service of the US.  Standard taxi driver here is either of the U WOT m8 variety, or the foreign guy that suddenly can't speak English when you question why he's charging you an extra couple of quid compared to his meter/the usual rate/other taxi-drivers etc."

melbourne,3dwzur,DanielWulf,22,Mon Jul 20 07:29:13 2015 UTC,it's definitely cheaper. I've been quoted at half the price of a taxi a few times.

melbourne,3dwzur,The_Autumnal_Crash,6,Mon Jul 20 11:30:50 2015 UTC,"Usually, although they have 'surge pricing' every now and then that can jack up the fare massively - this is called out before confirming an order, but is easy to ignore while munted ;)  Case in point: got in a state on Sat night, did the usual trick of ordering an uber. Skipped past the warning without thinking - copped 2.6x the usual fare. (mid twenties became mid seventies)  Would have grabbed a taxi had I realised."
melbourne,3dwzur,5444,20,Mon Jul 20 07:44:03 2015 UTC,"There is a trick to this surge pricing game, you just walk towards to your destination for 5-10 minutes. From what I have figured, surge pricing seems to be based on your location and the demand within that area."
melbourne,3dwzur,mr-snrub-,7,Mon Jul 20 08:13:40 2015 UTC,The surges happen when they're not enough drivers in the area. By bumping up the prices it encourages riders to wait patiently for more drivers to become available and it encourages driver to drive towards busy areas to get paid the surge rates.

melbourne,3dwzur,cameronm,4,Mon Jul 20 14:09:56 2015 UTC,"In theory, those Ubers a 5-10 minute walk away are heading towards the surge zone to try and score a surge passenger. I don't think this'll be more successful than just waiting 10 minutes for drivers to swarm to the area."
melbourne,3dwzur,pressbutton,3,Mon Jul 20 08:57:06 2015 UTC,"Going to need more science before I believe you. The idea is that it incentivesises drivers to wake up and be on call, so maybe by moving you're adjusting the supply/demand for your radius."
melbourne,3dwzur,mr-snrub-,5,Mon Jul 20 10:27:22 2015 UTC,"Next time I log on, I'll show you what the zones look like."
melbourne,3dwzur,Nth-Degree,10,Mon Jul 20 10:36:12 2015 UTC,"Surges are automatic - and based purely on supply/demand in the area you're in. They happen when there are drivers on the road, but they're all busy or not quite in range. It encourages drivers on the peripheral of your zone to head toward you. They rarely last more than 20 minutes (except on Saturday night sometimes when some event is on).  As a guide: Normal Uber price is: $1.10 per km + $0.35 per minute + $2 flagfall.  At those rates, Uber is roughly on par with a Taxi when it hits 1.5x - except on taxi ""peak"" periods (When taxis also bump up their rates). During peak taxi periods, Uber is roughly on par with Taxis at 2.0x  In my experience, hitting the ""Notify me when the surge ends"" button is good enough. I can usually sit in the pub an extra 20 minutes or so. People seem to be getting onto this trick though, so it'll often surge again soon after as everyone was waiting. So, book straight away!  Also, I don't mind paying the surge sometimes - especially when it's 1.something. Still cheaper than a taxi, is still a better service, and the drivers can really use the extra money (these people don't make all that much driving us around).  Finally: The driver can do nothing about the rate. If you ended up drunk-accepting a 3.5x fare and had to pay $50 to get home, this isn't the driver's fault. Don't rate him/her poorly for it. Your ratings can really affect a driver. One of my favourites was taken off the road a couple of weeks ago because his average rating hit 4.5.  Yes - a 4-star rating is like telling Uber that ""if every trip is this bad, this driver should be taken off the road"". Uber is an American company, and they expect 5 stars every trip. You start at 5, and lose points for stuff. I used to give out 4's a fair bit, thinking that 5 stars were for something amazing, but it turns out that isn't how Uber sees things."

melbourne,3dwzur,The_Autumnal_Crash,2,Mon Jul 20 08:25:34 2015 UTC,"I would expect it's location based,  but not really sure - this was the first time that I've experienced it, although I've seen email notifications from them before warning of possible surge pricing due to events and such."
melbourne,3dwzur,walnutpal,2,Mon Jul 20 09:51:38 2015 UTC,"It's based on demand in a certain area at a certain time. Uber copped flack for having some ridiculous surge pricing (something like 4x) for traffic leaving the Sydney CBD during the Sydney Siege.  Edit: surge on rides leaving the city, not because of the amount of traffic on the streets."
melbourne,3dwzur,Shes_the_Cheese,5,Mon Jul 20 11:13:03 2015 UTC,"I catch an uber to Brunswick from Balwyn every Saturday morning. It's $22 for uber x and $38 for a taxi. Same route, same time of day."
melbourne,3dwzur,pskipw,4,Mon Jul 20 08:42:17 2015 UTC,"Going by recent rides, I reckon Uber X is around 25% cheaper than a cab, and Uber Black is maybe 50% more expensive. It varies, though, as others have mentioned re surging."
melbourne,3dwzur,Kairos27,2,Mon Jul 20 08:01:53 2015 UTC,"People keep telling me it's cheaper, but I was taking taxis up until a week ago, and I gotta say, they are not cheaper. In some cases taxis are cheaper. I don't know wtf kind of taxis other people have been taking, but ""uber is cheaper"" is nonsense. And yes, I've been taking Uber X.  The only reason I use Uber now is because their GPS is better. Without fail, every single freaking taxi I've taken from my house attempts to turn right onto a no right turns street near my house; first Uber I get, finds the better route immediately."
melbourne,3dwzur,Nth-Degree,2,Mon Jul 20 13:06:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but Uber is demonstrably cheaper. The rates for a taxi are here and for Uber in Melbourne are here.  Let's say you take a 10km trip that lasts 15 minutes (with 3 minutes of that time travelling under 21km/h).  |             |  Taxi                       |  Uber |Week Day     | $4.2+$16.22+$1.704 = $22.12 | $2+$11+$3.5 = $16.50 |Week Night   | $5.2+$16.80+$1.893 = $23.89 | $2+$11+$3.5 = $16.50 |11pm Saturday| $6.2+$19.86+$2.085 = $28.15 | $2+$11+$3.5 = $16.50   To be fair, at 11pm on a Saturday, you're possibly somewhere that's surging. So, let's apply a 2.0x multiplier to that last rate - Uber is now $33.  So, you're right - sometimes Uber is more expensive. But, only if you accept the 2.0x fare. But even then, if you tally the three trips, you're still $8.16 better off on Uber than you were for the three taxi rides. If however, you waited out the surge, you are $24.66 better off.  Edit: Formatting (tables suck in Reddit)"
melbourne,3dwzur,ceslek,2,Tue Jul 21 04:59:37 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong, but it generally comes out to about $0.80-$1.00 (edit: per mile) if there's little or no traffic."

melbourne,3dwzur,aussieaussie1,3,Mon Jul 20 10:40:55 2015 UTC,I was at Revs last Friday night. Left at 8am and ordered an uber.   He was out the front waiting for a booking.

melbourne,3dwzur,EastCoastKids,2,Mon Jul 20 11:14:15 2015 UTC,How does uber work? Isn't it against most auto insurances policies to use a personal vehicle as a taxi.

melbourne,3e1xsh,testbug0,2,Tue Jul 21 09:41:25 2015 UTC,Exactly. If it was popular on /r/melbourne initially because of myki nobody would get it. Fortunately everyone loves to jerk it over Uber. DAE?
melbourne,3e1xsh,pressbutton,5,Tue Jul 21 10:18:47 2015 UTC,Why would myki be popular outside of Melbourne?

melbourne,3e1xsh,Halfwombat,12,Tue Jul 21 10:54:42 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how it happened. It looked like it was slowing down around 11pm but then it hit front page of r/all and exploded again. I'm guessing the next highest post from r/melbourne never hit front page of r/all? Not that I'm complaining. So much sweet sweet karma.
melbourne,3e1xsh,Sneffy,2,Tue Jul 21 12:12:24 2015 UTC,cause everyone was expecting a sex story ;)
melbourne,3e1xsh,drizzy_chioska,2,Tue Jul 21 09:36:10 2015 UTC,So someone linked it to a bigger sub? You should cash in that karma while the exchange rate is good.
melbourne,3e1xsh,Sneffy,4,Tue Jul 21 09:39:18 2015 UTC,Not so much linked. r/all is just every subreddit on reddit (where the front page is only the default subs)

However, I think this was sort of natural, not a lot of content gets posted between the time Australia goes to bed and Europe wakes up, so Europe ends up waking up to an Australian front page. Combine that with something positive about Uber, and you've got some viral gold.  /r/sweden ends up on /r/all randomly a lot too, sometimes a small sub just gets pushed up."

melbourne,3e0xop,LineNoise,17,Tue Jul 21 02:48:24 2015 UTC,"Would be good to see this officially raised to 100.  From my experience riding it on a motorbike, you either physically can't do the 80km/h in peak periods or you'd get run over if you actually kept to it off peak.  Has to be one of the most widely ignored limits in the state.  Really not comfortable with extending the deed however."
melbourne,3e0xop,Kurayamino,7,Tue Jul 21 02:49:44 2015 UTC,"Yep, when traffic is moving everyone goes 100 on the 80 stretches and 120 in the 100's anyway.  Except in the tunnels, even when traffic is moving and the limit's 80 everyone slows to 60 for some fucking reason. The only time I go 80 through there is when there's no traffic."
melbourne,3e0xop,FreakySpook,3,Tue Jul 21 03:17:16 2015 UTC,"I travel on this stretch frequently during the week at different times.  In peak it definitely needs to be 80 or below, simply because Yarra Bend, Batman & Punt exits jam the left lane and you get a stupid amount of lane changing going on.  Off peak though there is no way it needs to be 80 unless there is an incident, when they last upgraded the road they should have just installed variable speed limits all the way out to Warrigal Road."
melbourne,3e0xop,Kurayamino,3,Tue Jul 21 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"Oh god, the far right lanes slowing down to like 40 because the offramps are all full.  That's what really needs to be done to unfuck that mess, figure out how to get everyone off the fucking offramp."
melbourne,3e0xop,Albatraozz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:44:44 2015 UTC,The one at Burke Rd is a mess as well.  Hopefully the level crossing removal will ease that.
melbourne,3e0xop,shitrosebouquet,5,Tue Jul 21 03:57:31 2015 UTC,It's the same with Eastlink Tunnels going down everybody does 80 km/h. But as soon as you start to go uphill again? Suddenly people can't accelerate any more and everyone ends up doing 60.
melbourne,3e0xop,thenewkumden,10,Tue Jul 21 03:21:50 2015 UTC,Well the engine started making this alarming revving sound so I took my foot off the go-pedal.
melbourne,3e0xop,EarlChop,3,Tue Jul 21 07:25:14 2015 UTC,I'd love to know the science behind why people can't drive through a fucking tunnel. The speed limit could be unmetered and 12 lanes wide but it will always bottleneck to people going 40km/h because tunnel.
melbourne,3e0xop,Rod750,7,Tue Jul 21 04:53:20 2015 UTC,People are so scared of being fined by the cameras in there that they slow right down. It's fucking dangerous because people are fixated on their speedos and not on the road and the other cars.  The way they've engineered people to be more concerned about not being 2kph over the speed limit instead of worrying about the conditions around them has made drivers in Melbourne some of the worst going around.
melbourne,3e0xop,thenewkumden,2,Tue Jul 21 09:49:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's when it's starting the uphill bit that those who are in some sort of stupor start slowing down.  It's like the pulsing of the overhead lights through their windscreen hypnotizes them.  But strangely enough, I notice that people are starting to get thrown by long upward grades.  The slowdown also happens on the upwards half of the westgate bridge.  And what's even stranger is that there is a crest in the road past the weather radar in Sayers road, Laverton, where people crawl over the brow of the hill as if they're expecting a helicopter to have landed on the road.  Then when they've crested the hill they speed back up!  Must be flatlanders.  Teh dangerous hill: watch out for hazards!..:  https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.8547774,144.7568881,20z/data=!3m1!1e3"
melbourne,3e0xop,jdgordon,2,Tue Jul 21 06:18:32 2015 UTC,And don't get me started on the section of the Tulla near Essendon airport. People slow to 80 there for NO GODDAMN REASON.
melbourne,3e0xop,ign1fy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:28:23 2015 UTC,"probably because they still havent realised they increased the speed limit there (what, 3 year ago or something!?)"

melbourne,3e2idz,GuavaSack,3,Tue Jul 21 13:31:01 2015 UTC,Brother did his in Mooroolbark and said it was really easy - straight roads and round abouts mainly. Keep checking all your mirrors during test :)
melbourne,3e2idz,veeface,4,Tue Jul 21 13:57:07 2015 UTC,Do the roundabout triangle a few times if you go there. It's daunting for those unaware of it and Vic roads is basically on that triangle.
melbourne,3e2idz,Hellman109,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, if you do not live in Mooroolbark or have not experienced the triangle roundabout do not do your test there!  Also be very aware of school zones. I did my test at both and much enjoyed Burwood far more."
melbourne,3e2idz,MezjE,3,Tue Jul 21 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"Welp you're gonna be nervous so there's no point trying to ignore it. Just watch mirrors as much as you can. Make sure you make it REALLY FUCKING OBVIOUS when you check mirrors, head check or do anything. Just drive like you would with an instructor and everything will be fine :)"
melbourne,3e2idz,hellions123,4,Tue Jul 21 20:55:52 2015 UTC,Don't be nervous - nerves will make you think more and you don't want that. Head checks are great - be very careful of your speed limit and especially in school zones if in that time - all the best for your test :)
melbourne,3e2idz,HW28,4,Tue Jul 21 14:00:22 2015 UTC,"When you check your mirrors, make sure you actually turn your head a little to make it obvious that you're checking."

Just make sure you indicate for 5 seconds and head check following the parallel park, I think that's something that catches a lot of people"
melbourne,3e2idz,tgeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:45:06 2015 UTC,"Go for Mooroolbark. It's a lot quieter on the road, and it's such an easy drive. Just make sure you go through the roundabouts a few times before you take your test. Good luck!"
melbourne,3e2idz,tvt_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:46 2015 UTC,Just be confident in your ability. If you have done well driving on your learners you should be fine.

melbourne,3e2gyd,sierra-juliet,2,Tue Jul 21 13:59:41 2015 UTC,Urban Spoon is known to be untrustworthy and field fake reviews.
melbourne,3e2gyd,dropbear8mybaby,2,Tue Jul 21 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"Not totally sure why this is being downvoted.  Large review sites are known to have problems with spam and paid, fake reviews. Yelp notably has a court ruling saying they can take money from businesses to manipulate ratings/remove reviews.  It would be nice to have an Amazon style 'was this review helpful'/'most helpful positive review'/'most helpful negative review' system, but I suspect this would just mask the problem - 1 star 'haha just kidding it's amazing' reviews would be the next problem."
melbourne,3e226e,LucidityWaver,3,Tue Jul 21 10:30:51 2015 UTC,"You've left out the most important part, the issues she aimes to have solved. Narcolepsy was one but does she have back pain? Depression? Skin issues? Migraines? Doctors don't know everything about every health problem, that's why most of them will refer you to a specialist if they can't fix the problem after one visit. In my opinion a horrible doctor is someone who you keep going back to time and time again for the same issue. Doesn't matter if your wife likes him/her a lot or if they spend a lot of time with you. If the issue isn't fixed stop wasting your time and money, go to a specialist."
melbourne,3e226e,Sean10111,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:45:05 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry, but excluding specifics was related to privacy rather than accidental. Unfortunately, we've only been referred to one specialist by any doctor in Melbourne -- which was by Dr Boltin for Narcolepsy. That specialist has been fantastic, but it's a hard condition to live with that's also hard to treat at all, let alone effectively. Most of the other issues do not have an official diagnosis or have been misdiagnosed -- every different skin problem is eczema according to some doctors. I'd love for my partner to be referred to a decent dermatologist but it simply hasn't happened, even after asking directly for a referral."
melbourne,3e226e,Sean10111,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:57:35 2015 UTC,"Wow that seems unfair. Have you tried a massive bulk billing medical center? Bundoora/mill park superclinic comes to mind. Bulk billing doctors have twice as many patients as normal doctors so they want to get you out of there as soon as possible, especially at a big clinic. I've never had issues getting a referall if I turn up with a more specialised condition. If they say no book in another appointment the next day and keep going back till they're sick of you."
melbourne,3e226e,SEXPILUS,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:07:00 2015 UTC,"That's kinda how we got started with Dr. Boltin, at a bulk billing medical centre, with appointments at least once a week at first. It got too much while trying to keep on top of centrelink, TAFE and job seeking concerns and, eventually, we accepted that we weren't getting anywhere there. Unfortunately, we also haven't been able to make any other progress through other doctors yet. We really wouldn't mind travelling an hour or more to see a doctor who can help."
melbourne,3e226e,Jade54,3,Tue Jul 21 11:37:30 2015 UTC,"I can't give you a whole lot of detail about how this doctor might suit your particular situation, but I highly recommend Dr Judith Kirwood (St Kilda Rd Medical Centre).  I don't know anything about the clinic or costs, because I used to see Dr Kirwood when she worked at my university's medical clinic.  She is thorough with tests, always gave good referrals when necessary, and persistent when follow up was required. Like, so persistent she would send letters to my house and call me when I needed to hurry up with a test I hadn't done, or make an appointment for follow up. I feel like she is the only GP I've seen who was invested in my health, and wanted to see issues through to the end."

melbourne,3e226e,tiredgrad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:50 2015 UTC,"She just really seemed to cut  to the chase in my opinion, was very clever and decisive about which direction she wanted to go and I also love her manner and personality. I think part of what you want is up to you, for example this practice offers extended consults so I suggest you book one. The kind of visit you want is not standard and you know this ahead of time that it won't be simple so I would book extra time. I would also make sure you have all medical history and prior tests with you so the doctor has all that info available. I would also be 100% honest that you haven't been happy with prior doctors and why."

Not only that, but all the makings are there for more problems in the future.  My friend works as a social worker in the Pakenham ""growth corridor"", where sleazy developers build suburbs with zero park/facilities/amenities and then run off with their millions, while the residents of those areas, some only built a couple of years ago, are already seeing all the youth crime/drug problems associated with life in hopeless suburbia.  Between corrupt, inept and apathetic councils, and greedy, heartless developers, we're in the process of building the ghettoes of the future.  And it could all be avoided if people just weren't so mindlessly greedy."
melbourne,3e1drz,Phallic,0,Tue Jul 21 06:26:32 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but loads of apartments in the area/living in an apartment doesn't make a suburb turn into a ghetto.  The reason a suburb turns into a ghetto is because all the low lifes get squeezed out of all the other suburbs(they are low lifes, don't have jobs, education etc) so they all go to 1 suburb where there is tons of housing commission or very cheap housing.  Every person has ample opportunity to get an education and skill themselves up to get a job. If you choose not to better yourself, then it's your own fault. If you choose to be a low life bogan, then its your own fault.  We will have to accept that there will always be a percentage of the population who are those ""houso"" types and they just have themselves to blame./"

melbourne,3e1drz,rdmarshman,7,Tue Jul 21 06:40:52 2015 UTC,I've spoken to Broadmeadows MP Frank McGuire (great guy) and the situation he paints there is basically ghettoisation. Broadmeadows is a massive outlier in youth unemployment. It's a serious issue that the government needs to address - take away a tenth of the resources from the ten most affluent suburbs and invest it to avoid a mini Detroit on our hands.

melbourne,3e1drz,pongomostest,-2,Tue Jul 21 08:36:24 2015 UTC,"I couldn't find the article but it doesn't matter. I know in my town of Flemington I've watched it change over the last 26 years to become a getto with high density housing and substance abuse issues  of paramount proportions. It's getting worse as the days go by.  Here is one for you and this happened to me. I was at Maccas on Racecourse Road and picking up a burger and looked down to the floor to find a little bag of ice or smack or speed. Not sure what it was but it leads to a question. Was the drugs on the floor a result of someone dropping it from their pocket or was it sold over the counter at Maccas?  Yep, 3031 is not improving."
melbourne,3e1drz,acpower7,2,Tue Jul 21 06:42:11 2015 UTC,"I think you are completely delusional to suggest Flemington is even remotely close to being a 'ghetto'. There are definitely some junkies that live in those highrises (just like any housing commission highrise) but they don't bother anyone and are hardly even seen. I've lived there for a few years and saw no major problems at all, especially these days.  Btw 3031 also incorporates Kensington, which is actually one of the more leafier suburbs in Melbourne."
melbourne,3e1drz,pongomostest,-1,Tue Jul 21 08:51:45 2015 UTC,You don't know what you are talking about i would think you are isolated from the issues. Talk to the guys at the Kens/ Flem community legal center and you probability won't shoot your mouth of as much. Your middle class values are nothing more that patronizing.
melbourne,3e1drz,acpower7,2,Tue Jul 21 12:08:11 2015 UTC,"Lol @ 'middle class values'. I've lived on the housing commission flats in the area for well over a decade, I am in no way 'isolated' from the issues. I know what the area is like first hand. I don't need to ask anyone to get an idea of what it's like, unlike you.   As for the community center, you can ask social workers of any suburb and they'd give you a very gloomy look of the community they serve as they're constantly exposed to the worst of their community 24/7."

melbourne,3e2aup,BRT_420,6,Tue Jul 21 12:17:34 2015 UTC,"You say you want to do business and economics. Both are pretty grounded in maths, so based on that, I'd say you'd probably be best doing at least year 11 general maths particularly because of its focus on data analysis.   In year 10, we were split into two streams of maths classes, one stream was for advanced, more theory based maths (algebra, calculus), while the second stream was more practical maths (trigonometry, matrices, networks, data and statistics) and then in VCE we naturally flowed into Methods and General. Does your school do that now? In year 10 I was in the same position as you. I bit the bullet and am honestly glad I did.   If you do take the plunge, your teachers always want to see you do well and will always be there to help you. Don't be afraid to ask.  Good luck."
melbourne,3e2aup,CaptnCrumble,3,Tue Jul 21 14:04:16 2015 UTC,"Seconding this - I did 'Business' at uni in which Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Statistics and Accounting were all separate semester long subjects. None of them involved particularly complex maths but if I'd been two years out of practice (ie. if I'd quit maths in year 10) it would have been twice as daunting. Do they still have 'veggie maths' in VCE? Sorry, I can't remember the proper name for it :-/ there was methods then general and then one below that was the most basic and was year 11 only? But I think if you did well enough you could move to general for year 12?"

I know history is pretty useless so I'm thinking about a course in biology, politics or business but I'll have no idea where that will leave me. Thanks for the reply"
melbourne,3e2aup,matthras,2,Tue Jul 21 12:46:23 2015 UTC,"OK, maths definitely isn't a must. Do what you're most comfortable with. At most it'll give you a leg up in the long run for business/commerce/economics stuff that includes mathematics which...well I don't think even I could convince you with that reasoning :p  EDIT: I'm only going by UniMelb requirements for the Bachelor of Commerce here, but as per comment below you do indeed need to do maths if you want to do Commerce.   If you still want to do some kind of maths in VCE, consider looking into General/Further Mathematics which covers concepts that may be more approachable rather than (presumably) the calculus/algebra stuff you struggled with. It won't benefit you with regards to university requirements, though. Only Methods + Spesh is relevant."

A lot of schools won't tell you about that loophole and kids often assume that maths is compulsory like English. But if you've got better options it's definitely something that can be replaceable. Besides, any maths prerequisites for uni involve methods, which even if you did take maths, you'd probably do further,,which gets marked down anyway. So follow your instincts and you'll be fine!"

melbourne,3e2aup,itisknown__,2,Tue Jul 21 13:43:55 2015 UTC,"I think its a valuable skill to develop for your life in general. you can still fail year 11 math and not have it effect your atar in a meaningfull way. You also dont have to do it in yr 12. I still think doing gen math at yr 11 level is a solid addition to your general knowledge for the rest of your life and you should give it a real go. Unless you have a learning disability there is no reason you cant do reasonably well at it, so long as you stay on top of your studies and seek help when required.  Consider year 11 math as a challenge in further developing your study habits. You can drop it in year 12 and still carry those study habits with you to yr 12 and uni.  Anyone who claims yr 10 math is enough is wrong imo. life is full of math and the problem solving skills aquired can be applied to everything forever and i dont just mean calculating your change when you pay with a $50 note.  Education shouldnt be all about whats easy or what gives you the quick enter score. Its about developing yourself as a person.   I say do the math."
melbourne,3e2aup,frglion,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:24:41 2015 UTC,"I think you should do maths in year 11. It won't affect your ATAR in any way, and, say you do Arts at uni and find that in the first year you want to study Economics instead, you'll only need to do a one semester 3+4 Maths Methods bridging subject to be accepted into an Economics/commerce degree (plus, of course, maintaining a good GPA).

It's a part of heaps of courses as a prereq but you only have to get 25 on most prereqs. Not doing it may limit your options two years later when choosing courses.

melbourne,3e0yzo,Sean10111,2,Tue Jul 21 03:13:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah got a referral yesterday, have been calling through a big list of people and the cheapest looks to be $180 in East Richmond."
melbourne,3e0yzo,monsterhead,4,Tue Jul 21 03:34:57 2015 UTC,Let me know if you find a cheaper one. $110 for 5 minutes with a dermatologist is still a lot of money. I remember she was 1 hour behind schedule and there were 9 people who got in before me within that hour and the waiting room was still full when I left. She was making more than $1000 an hour from poor students like us.

melbourne,3e1auc,othiSA,5,Tue Jul 21 04:51:56 2015 UTC,"GPs have to liaise with a specialist to be able to prescribe T. It can often be a complex issue and they have to make sure T isn't a bandaid fix, and that they're getting to the bottom of the actual reason you have it in the first place. So it's not so much that they won't prescribe it, it's that they can't. Have you seen an endocrinologist? Unless you're having some really negative side effects from the low T like really low energy (not caused by other health issues) or difficulty conceiving I feel like you're going to have an uphill battle. If I was you, my next step would be getting that endo referral to really work out if this is the best course of action. Can I ask who diagnosed you with low T?"
melbourne,3e1auc,purpleautumnleaf,-1,Tue Jul 21 06:22:49 2015 UTC,what else would i do if no other health issues resulted? i diagnosed myself
melbourne,3e1auc,Heytunk,2,Tue Jul 21 07:57:24 2015 UTC,Well there's your problem. Get a appointment with a endo.    Doctors don't just hand out test like candy.

melbourne,3e1auc,browsingfromwork,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:12:11 2015 UTC,"That's where the GP comes in, it's their job to work out what's going on and to be thorough and cover all bases. Eg, low energy could be chronic fatigue syndrome or low iron, difficulty achieving an erection could be stress related, troubles getting a partner pregnant could be poor sperm motility - they need to put all the pieces of the symptom puzzle together as well as the results of any tests they order.  Look, you might be right (I was right about my low progesterone) but you need to have a chat with a doctor and a bunch of blood tests first before anything else happens. If you're looking for a rec for a good GP who's going to be willing to explore what's going on with you, and get to the bottom of it to get you the right treatment I'm sure people can help you out there."
melbourne,3e1auc,puppythruster,4,Tue Jul 21 08:19:50 2015 UTC,eh? I'm confused. do you want   1) a test to confirm your low testosterone results?   2) a doctor to prescribe you testosterone because of your low results from the test?
melbourne,3e1auc,amysoyka,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:57:39 2015 UTC,"Who diagnosed you with low-T?  You've got two chances of getting a testosterone script. Low-T is a tricky diagnosis and not really a disease state so you'll struggle to get a treatment for it, doubley so if you're under 50 years old."

melbourne,3dxa87,chessc,4,Mon Jul 20 10:02:51 2015 UTC,"There sounds like alot of assumptions in that post, the big one is people paying attention to their surrounds while driving, something that isn't as common as it used to be. :P  That being said there can be reasons for it, the one and only time I had personally done it, was when a tram stopped at a red Tram signal(when I had a green traffic signal) then turned on the hazards and opened the doors when I was within a car length of the tram traveling at 50km per hour.  Luckily nobody jumped off straight away because there is no chance for a tonne of car doing 50km/h to stop in that distance even with perfect reflexes.  Not to mention you seem to assume that someone driving in Melbourne regularly drives around trams, considering the huge swathes of Melbourne without them, the chances of someone forgetting the rules or just not expecting it increases the risk of a near miss.  Your example of the turning lane drivers not stopping is the perfect example of it, if you aren't regularly around trams the first thought to a car stopping in a right hand lane is that they have been stopped by a car trying to turn right, not that there are pedestrians ahead of them trying to cross, so using the left hand lane(assuming it's a combo left turn + straight through) to pass the stopped car is a natural reaction, and since they can't see the pedestrians(due to the stopped car) they would have no idea you are there.  It's a complex issue and they are trying multiple things to fix it, it's just not easy to fix. :P  Edited: Formatting"
melbourne,3dxa87,dilbot2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:04:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks. Yeah i guess I'm assuming people drive around trams more often, forgetting the tram network doesn't cover the majority of the actual city. The left turning lane is actually turning only and there's no way they can't see the tram unless they aren't paying attention... I just needed to get it off my chest because i had a stressful day."
melbourne,3dxa87,dfbowen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:15:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's fine, we all get frustrated at things :P  It's less they can't see the tram and more they can't see pedestrians, most times if I see a bus with hazards on it's out of service or idling, so seeing hazards on a tram may not trigger the ""People are getting off"" in drivers heads, just that it's stopped.  And afaik you can pass a stopped tram, just not one with passengers entering/exiting, a key trick to this, as the difference between a stopped tram, and a stopped tram with exiting/entering passengers is usually just the hazards.  Because lets face it, the only indicator of a tram stop in a significant amount of places is a pole, or a pole and fence(outside of the safety zone stops :p)  Edited: Formatting, again"
melbourne,3dxa87,Hellman109,2,Mon Jul 20 10:54:00 2015 UTC,"You cant pass a stopped tram with it's doors open, but you're allowed to pass one that waiting at traffic lights or whatever.    But like you said, majority of people don't drive anywhere near trams and you don't specifically learn about them for your driver's license. That's like saying everyone in Melbourne knows how to do hook turns, just because they have them in the city. About 90% of my friends who all grew up here have no clue."

When you're driving a car, an ""honest"" mistake, or failing to notice something, or just following your ""natural"" reactions without thinking can kill someone."

melbourne,3dxa87,hillbillypolenta,2,Mon Jul 20 12:36:17 2015 UTC,Makes me wonder why they don't have automatic/driver operated cameras on the trams already (the technology is dirt cheap).   They could snare hundreds of offenders per day and probably substantially reduce future offences.

melbourne,3dxa87,hillbillypolenta,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:24:39 2015 UTC,Fair enough. What does it mean to make a mistake and not be admonished for it? What does it mean if there is a high chance you will be fined for your mistakes?  I think you will make less of them right? The CBD in melbourne is like a free for all at the moment.

melbourne,3dwsr0,Shes_the_Cheese,3,Mon Jul 20 06:31:20 2015 UTC,It's unfair to blame city of Melbourne for this. They do their bit by hiring (rather expensive) traffic management companies; they don't place the signs themselves.
melbourne,3dwsr0,panachetag,2,Mon Jul 20 08:23:48 2015 UTC,"Then they should give them proper instructions of safely placing traffic signs. Of course they are to blame, not directly as an individual but as a organisation, absolutely."
melbourne,3dwsr0,PompeiiGraffiti,2,Mon Jul 20 11:25:02 2015 UTC,"No. The traffic management company has the training to know the correct places to put the traffic signs. The project manager at the council does not. That's the whole reason it's outsourced in the first place. The PM at the council who organized whatever the works are isn't going to come down for every project every day and check if all of the traffic management signs are in the right place, for fuck's sake."
melbourne,3dwsr0,panachetag,2,Mon Jul 20 12:01:19 2015 UTC,"So does this traffic management company have a popular Twitter account and social media team who are somewhat responsive?  I reckon calling the council could actually lead to changes in policy. If it gets popular, they might release a statement about how they are working on it or it was an isolated mistake or whatever, and direct the contractors to improve.  The alternative would be an email to the traffic management company. Which, even if you can find their contact details, would probs to didly squat."
