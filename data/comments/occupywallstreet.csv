Maybe because I'm white, or because I was raised in the woods ... but I still can't believe we're going to see mass internment camps in America. I'm sure there's already a small secret one for black bagged trouble-makers, but not on American soil.

occupywallstreet,3e2ae0,m_bishop,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:21:12 2015 UTC,"There was a civil war that started in the late 70s to early 80s due to growing Buddhist nationalism in the small island nation. Slowly, the Sinhalese Buddhists were taking over everything and marginalizing the other groups, even the Sinhalese Christians. The Buddhist Monks there hold sway over the nation and want to make it an all Buddhist country. They eliminated English as the curriculum standard (in a former English colony) and made their language (Sinhalese) the national language and the curriculum standard. They also noted that if you were a minority there, you would have to get ridiculously high grades to make it college, and if you were Sinhalese the standard was lower (like a reverse affirmative action). You also couldn't get any government jobs unless you spoke and wrote fluent Sinhala. Crazy thing is, the minority Tamils have a history there predating Sinhalese by thousands of years, and until the 1500s-1600s Sinhalese did not have a written alphabet and they borrowed Tamil. The Tamil (mostly Hindus, Catholics and Protestants) were marginalized. There were also riots where Tamils were massacred and tortured and the army that was called out to keep the peace, helped the rioters kill and rape Tamils and other minorities.  The civil war soon began, and  during the end stages, masses of Tamil civilians were taken into huge internment camps, where they were not fed and children disappeared, women raped and families murdered. Many were never repatriated to their homes and ancestral lands. Their lands and property was disbursed to Sinhalese to further take over Tamil ancestral lands (this had been going on for centuries, but accelerated since Sri Lankan independence). They government also used the war on terror to secure arms, and funds and training and other military assistance to defeat the rebels.  There are war crimes investigations ongoing in the UN that has been stifled by China, Russia and other nations who stand to benefit by being friendly with the Sri Lankan government because it is situated in busy international shipping lanes and is close to India. China uses this as a proxy and India, with the help of the west tries to woo the government of Sri Lanka to not let the Chinese further build ports, and station their Navy so close to India.  The people who have suffered and lost so much have never received any justice because of this. Their former president, who is under investigation (for war crimes in the UN) in Sri Lanka for stealing lots of money and other corruption also installed both his brothers and his son into the most powerful government offices.  The government also stands accused of killing minorities and selling their organs in the black market, among other atrocities."

I would love for people who don't share Enlightenment values to separate themselves and leave, so we don't have to fight them at home, where they have easy access to our soft underbelly.  And if we still have to fight them, we can shoot at them out in the desert, instead of within our own cities full of innocent bystanders.  Look, you can't force people to believe anything, outside of brainwashing from childhood.  The most we can do is to do a good job of presenting progressive Enlightenment philosophy / values, in the hopes that these people find the ideas more compelling than the awful stuff that radical Islam is peddling.  But in the many cases that we are going to lose that battle, and make no mistake we are losing that battle, then the best we can hope for is to distance them from ourselves.  Internment camps are a disgusting idea, but it's fair enough to admit that we can't live together, and eject them to places dominated by their belief systems, so they can go live and die with their own kind, as their fate dictates.

occupywallstreet,3e0e5v,1hobo,5,Tue Jul 21 00:08:19 2015 UTC,Just want to point out this measure was approved by committee and has not even gone to the house floor for a vote. While that may be a cause for alarm if you're worried about GMOs it is in no way banned and the title of this post is very misleading.
occupywallstreet,3e0e5v,mfdl,15,Tue Jul 21 10:47:54 2015 UTC,"As another poster suggested all crops humans eat have genetically manipulated at the level of artificial selection for desired traits. We humans have done this over time throughout our human history. However modern genetic engineering is not artificial selection. If someone wanted to in a single year they could engineer fruit to contain high levels of biological toxins like cyanide (used by some plants in seeds to protect against excess eating by animals ).  Needless to say cyanide poison could kill pests but could people too and companies have no reason to do this but what if they were to do it accidentally In the process of engineering resistant plants ?How does this differ from traditional genetic breeding ?  In artificial selection (breeding) we rely on a plants inherent genetic program as part of a fail safe against harm and the second fail safe against harm is that as we genetically select for traits (select big tomatoes) we select against undesirable traits (we don't breed tomato plants that are bitter, possibly containing toxins!). Thus slow successive genetic manipulation is generally recognized as safe and this is part of what is skipped In engineering.   GMO food doesn't follow this process but can still be safe. Despite this you are placing all trust in the crop creators and those creators are not providing information to you about the manipulations done.   As of now this formula is a little too lopsided. Folks really don't have much or anything to fear from GMO crops but people arguably have the right to know when food consumed is the product of a human and thus subject to possible human error.   And one final thought is that these GMO guys pushing silence about GMO is totally the wrong marketing theme. Yeah crop X has BT toxin inside... But if you are disclosing that and then you also engineer in ""healthy"" proteins and or vitamin production (yeah it is hard!) than people just might go wild and love the stuff. You are making food better don't hide it you should own it."
occupywallstreet,3e0e5v,Eldritter,3,Tue Jul 21 01:32:26 2015 UTC,"You make a lot of points but I wanted to clear one thing up:   those creators are not providing information to you about the manipulations done.   This is not the case - every transgenic event has to be registered with the USDA and also tested (its also super expensive to do so).  Each specific technology is also painstakingly documented as well as patented.  The science behind the manipulation is very much publicly available.  For example: here is the patent for bt technology which is used in multiple crops, for example corn for controlling western corn rootworm.  The distinction I think is that a lot of people don't go and look this stuff up or lack the technical ability to read though that kind of literature (or the huge body of literature detailing other aspects of specific transgenic products).   On a completely different aside when I read the title of this article and the name of the subreddit my first thought was ""what does GMO have to do with occupy wallstreet?""  I think its a pretty far stretch to link the two and trying to do so really cheapens, dilutes, and obfuscates the original goal/message of occupy which was (still is? does occupywallstreet exist in any meaningful way still? Serious question) about income inequality."
occupywallstreet,3e0e5v,snipehunt,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:58 2015 UTC,Your point about patented information on GMOs is fine but doesn't address the specific issue about which mods are in a given grocery item at the time of purchase which is what the thread is about.

occupywallstreet,3e0e5v,snipehunt,7,Tue Jul 21 20:36:15 2015 UTC,I don't care about GMOs.  There's no science showing that they are harmful.  I don't think it's an issue worth fighting.

occupywallstreet,3e0e5v,CydeWeys,4,Tue Jul 21 14:26:58 2015 UTC,"Because everything you eat is GMO at some level.  Time scales are the problem most people are butthurt over.

If we had to label every fucking plant we sell, the costs would be insane and for no reason except some fear mongering twats that do not understand science.

I’m a scientist, I don’t speak legalese. Monsanto gets a lot of pain in the public press, but they are the company that interacts the best with public scientists — they have always been on the forefront of pushing public research forward.”"
occupywallstreet,3e0e5v,dtiftw,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:24:27 2015 UTC,"Ya i wish I was making this stuff up.   Yet Monsanto has refused to meet its burden of proof about these claims with evidence. Moreover, it intimidates independent scientists from testing its proprietary products!   Also look what happens when negative results are posted regarding  GMO products:    These questions of risks and safety have festered for years because the big agrichemical companies use their intellectual property rights to deny independent scientists the ability to test genetically engineered crops, or to report their results. Scientific American called these restrictions on free inquiry ""dangerous."" ""In a number of cases,"" the magazine reports, ""experiments that had the implicit go-ahead from the seed company were later blocked from publication because the results were not flattering.""  When scientists do publish studies adverse to the interests of the big agrichemical companies, they are met with vicious attacks on their credibility, their science and even in their personal lives.

Not to mention the NDAs that he made the journalists he published to (not the scientists, as every other study does) sign so he could get maximum publicity from before the scientific community could call him out.

occupywallstreet,3dv5br,Orangutan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:50:53 2015 UTC,"I kindah expect the USS Liberty was basically an incident... But dont want to spend the time backing it up. If that were so, /r/documentaries censoring it is because the commenters and commenting system fails to get at that.  Not to imply that scandalous shit doesnt exist. Or that the response of media and investigation afterwards doesnt say anything. It could be a strong test of the idea of ""worthy and unworthy victims"". These being unworthy, because the press wouldnt want to attract attention to this. However, taking it to this -US marines- seems to go very far, and if it was an accident, so it may well have been reported decently."

occupywallstreet,3dovwl,pateras,2,Sat Jul 18 01:20:28 2015 UTC,Revolt is brewing in the AFT after they idiotically enforced the corporate candidate (Clinton) without gaining consensus from membership - they will now deal with the consequences. Teachers are furious. Teachers are now learning about real democracy - and there's no turning back to McDemocrat or McCapitalism. AFT is doomed. corporate capitalism is swiftly dying.
