electronics,3e14tt,clientsoup,9,Tue Jul 21 03:50:01 2015 UTC,Maybe a bit off-topic but what's your plan with the Coin? Cards with a magnet strip are being phased out from October 1st.  Plastc claim they will add chip functionality in the future but that will never happen. I wanted to buy one to use in Europe but my bank assured me things like Plastc or Coin are never going to happen with chip cards.
electronics,3e14tt,DelusionalX1,4,Tue Jul 21 09:36:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe (and this is just a supposition), that is so because the magnetic stripes have all the data readily exposed. If you get a magstipe card, you can copy all the data needed for transactions. Meanwhile, chip cards do some crypto on the chip and probably have their own key stored on the sillicone. I think that key is not accessible to be read directly (at least now without extensive dissasembly) ergo the card can not be cloned. Anyone here can confirm or infirm my suppositions here?"
electronics,3e14tt,illjustcheckthis,3,Tue Jul 21 10:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the reason. Plastc states they can just copy chip contents though, which seems a bit strange.  I'm not familiar with the de/encryption chain of chip cards. Maybe they have an encrypted key stored which is only decrypted by a licensed terminal. But I don't think that's the case as it would be possible to clone all chip cards without any trouble.  I guess I'll read up on how these cards work."
electronics,3e14tt,DelusionalX1,3,Tue Jul 21 11:52:34 2015 UTC,"That is a blatant lie. EMV isn't the most secure system in the world, but it isn't yet cloneable, and it it's quite likely that it would be illegal for them to sell a device that did it if they had a way. The only way these vendors like plastc and coin are going to be able to do EMV is by contracting with the credit card companies."
electronics,3e14tt,gxti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:12 2015 UTC,"That's what I thought (but was secretly hoping wasn't the case).  Maybe I misinterpreted what they mean by ""card reader"" and maybe they only use that device to copy magstrip cards but they also claim they will enable the chip using a firmware update."
electronics,3e14tt,DelusionalX1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:19:02 2015 UTC,I don't think that's their claim. Their blog seems to claim that they are setting up (or trying to) some system with the banks to allow their card to imitate other cards. I'm not going to hold my breath for that panning out.
electronics,3e14tt,rcxdude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:11 2015 UTC,"But they claim:   When you insert your card into the reader, we will be adhering to PCI standards for storing and encryption when inputting your data onto the Wallet app, as well as transferring your data to your Plastc Card.   So they are saying they will be able to read your EMV cards and copy it's content into their app which will forward it to the Plastc card itself."
electronics,3e14tt,DelusionalX1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:18:03 2015 UTC,"hmmm, it's quite weasel-wordy. Very difficult to actually get a concrete technical explanation out of that. e.g. it's not hard to get a credit card number and name, etc out of the chip, so that could quite easily be the data that they're transferring, not actually the private key data which is needed to actually authorize a transaction using chip and PIN (at least in the normal way - EMV is pretty damn complicated)."
electronics,3e14tt,rcxdude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:05:42 2015 UTC,"Let's just assume they aren't going to meet their ""summer 2015"" deadline and definitely not for the OTA chip-enabling firmware."

They cost nothing but space, so if you have space to spare, they are free.  They may be used for initial programming, segment-by-segemnt production test (like for those mag coils).

electronics,3e40k1,SA2468,2,Tue Jul 21 20:02:27 2015 UTC,I need something much better than an RC servo. I also need it to move farther than an RC servo. Preferably there will be a gear ratio between the arm so that the servo can deal with the weight. That would mean it will need to spin multiple times to make the arm move 180'. So what should I even look for? Is it a giant servo that I need? Or do I need some kinda motor? As mentioned i'm fairly newb about this so i'm not even really sure what to look for for my application.
electronics,3e42dj,EviLRome0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:11:52 2015 UTC,"the little I've looked into it, it seem it needs a logic IC to make it go.  they are likely limiting the ports for cost reasons, both for that IC and for the DC converter total capacity.  you have to plan for the max with these things, and at up to 30W per port that's a lot of power.  of course, you can get the IC and build your own too, CHY100 is one"

However, they produce a LOT of heat, so you'll also need a heatsink.  Modern phones use USB (5V, ~1A)  Wasted Heat = (12V-5V) * 1A = 7 Watts Higher-end Phones = (12V-5V) * 2.1A = 14.7 Watts 5V/12V = ~41% Efficiency, yuck!   It's recommended to use a switching regulator instead, such as the MP2307, which are much more efficient (typically >80%)."

electronics,3dxd7q,ArtistEngineer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think you might be right.  (well spotted!)  My battery pack is 5V output, so I assume it's probably 7.4V 3.7V lipo internally. I'll assume the 12Ah applies to the lipo pack itself and not the USB outlet.  That's 7.4V 3.7V x 12Ah = 42 watt-hours.  The OP's battery is, say, 12V (average) from charged to near-discharged. So that's:  12V x 7Ah = 84 watt-hours.

Most of the stuff I own and use is from old stuff I took apart, especially because back when I started, the internet wasn't a thing.  Anything that has motors is a good choice, because motors are awesome. Fax machines, scanners, printers have strong, precise and expensive stepper motors, the first two have special linear CCD image sensors which are impossible to find (but also hard to use, but you could build a digital camera with enough patience), CD/DVD players have great brushless DC motors and lasers, and you'll find some cool switches and sensors on the way. Speakers have nice magnets, old CRT televisions have tons of varnished wiring and some high voltage stuff, computers have fans, hard drives have very nice magnets and pretty shiny disks.  I would pretty much just go for things with moving parts, because de-soldering resistors is a pain in the ass and you can just buy them anywhere. Of course nowadays moving mechanical parts are a thing of the past, but that doesn't mean you can't find old equipment like cassette, vinyl, VHS players, stereo systems, etc...  I don't recommend actually paying money for these though, just look for old crap around the house or look through rubbish or clearance and you'll find tons of cool stuff that no one needs. People throw out fax machines and printers all the time.  Then once you find some cool stuff and understand what it is, you can go on eBay and get more. It really sucks to have 10 different motors when you need two identical ones to build a robot. But on the other hand it also sucks to have 1000 choices on eBay and have no clue about what you want.

With a DC motor the printer would have no clue where the head is and that's crucial for printing. The paper feeder is usually also controlled by the same stepper motor to save costs - it runs backwards, bangs the print head against the side of the machine, which activates a mechanical switch that puts some gears against the motor and powers the paper feeder. It's ridiculously crap. Though I may be wrong, manufacturers never fail to innovate with how much they can do with almost no valuable parts and software.  Scanners may do away with it, because all they need to do is move the scan head steadily from one end to the other - any motor can do that (though steppers have the advantage of being able to go back and re-scan specific areas quickly if there's a buffer underrun while scanning)."

That said there are a few things I salvage. Well made cases of any size and material - quality stained hardwood or metal chassis haven't really come down in price the same way capacitors have. Also speakers with screw mounts, ignore anything without screw mounts, as they're a pain in the ass to mount. I haven't had much use for them yet, but it's also generally accepted that transformers are worth scavenging. Good audio transformers still aren't cheap, and the web is full of Microwave Oven Tranformer (MOT) projects if you like fire and hate safety.

Super old VCRs are good for electro-mechanical stuff as well. But yea, photocopiers are a 1 stop source for pretty well all the crap you need in a parts box.  Old microwaves have two large magnets, a fan or two, a synchronous motor, and a MOT (microwave oven transformer) that can be useful in some projects.  Old dishwashers and washing machines have mainly 240 volt stuff, but have pumps, solenoid valves, sensors and a few basic control items like relays and SCRs.  Anything modern is gonna be pretty well useless these days, as its all highly integrated stuff, so your best bet is the trash heap.  Broken remote control cars have a few nice bits of kit in them as well, brushless motors and shafts/bearings/joints.  Old servers, like 10 year old at least usually have some nice fans, and power supplies you can rig to provide a 12 volt psu for your workshop. You might also get a bunch of caps and fets if they are easy to remove. The best things though are the fans and heatsinks.  Though by far, the photocopier has always been the beast of parts harvesting. In old photocopiers i have found:  LCD Displays, front panel keypads, switches, backlights, LED matrix buttons, counters, beepers.  Power Supplies, both SMPS and old linear.  High voltage power supplies for corona wires.  Stepper motors of all sizes, both driving linear screws, gears, and toothed belts.

Optical sensors, CCDs, infrared sensors, limit switches, micro switches, rotary switches.  Gearboxes, worm, gear, electrical controller clutches, one way sprag bearings, long tool steel shafts, lots of nylon gears.  Large motherboards hosting a lot of analog driver components, power mosfets, driver chips for brushless DC motors, stepper motors, brushed motors.  Long aluminium and steel tubes, heater elements, quartz linear lamps, temperature sensors, temperature cut offs, 240 relays, EMI filters, safety cut out microswitches.  Large SMPS often with a huge variety of capacitors, diodes, inductors, transistors, regulators.

electronics,3dtyw1,PM_ME_O-SCOPE_SELFIE,11,Sun Jul 19 13:15:26 2015 UTC,Some aplications require Earth wire for safety and some dont depending on design. Depending on the design of the alarm clocks some have transformer directly on the plug to mains and only carry low voltage to the clock. low voltage - even if it gets on the metal case and you touch / lick it / whatever - is not dangerous and wont kill you. at best if it shorts the fuse trips and thats about it.  Some however carry mains to the inside electronics of the clock. those still depend on wether the earth is required or not. if the entire clock is metal then yes it requires earth as any faults that would connect mains to the clock case can kill a person. If the clock is plastic however and any mains faults cannot pose a direct risk to the user then it might not require earth. any faults with shortcircuits inside would trip a fuse. Any connection of mains to case would be harmless as case is plastic and non-conductive.  So yeah basically it depends. Not having earth doesnt mean unsafe.

electronics,3dtyw1,madscientistEE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:42:21 2015 UTC,I've never seen an alarm clock with an earth conductor in its mains wiring.   Almost all alarm clocks have line and neutral going straight into an isolating step down transformer save for mechanical movements which may have a mains operated synchronous motor attached to a gearbox.  The mains frequency is often used as the clock source in electronic clocks. This is coupled to a pin on the clock IC via a safety capacitor (Y2 rated) or taken from the secondary of the step down transformer.

electronics,3dqbtj,Seventytvvo,40,Sat Jul 18 12:27:21 2015 UTC,"I came back to the R&D department from a field trip and found they were working on bad bug for two weeks. There was an old, reliable smart A/D card that was not talking properly to the new main processor board. It was sporadic, and seemingly nonsensical as to when the A/D card  would reply.  They had created two teams to debug it, one team was researching the code of the old A/D board, and one team was researching the code in the new processor board.  I asked ""Has anybody put a scope on this yet?"". They all looked at me with disdain, because they were convinced it was a software bug. I went out and put a scope on it, and found that the communication level on the serial bus was a couple tenths of a volt too low for reliable operation. Somebody had put a series diode in the TX line, and it dropped the logic level down to make it hit-or-miss as to whether it worked or not. When you pumped two or more requests close together to the A/D card, the signal on the other side of the diode got pumped up by a couple tenths of a volt, and it would work.  So rather than change the card of the A/D to take the diode out, we just changed the software to send more pulses in the request to pump the diode. =-} A goofy software fix to compensate for a goofy hardware error made many years previously."

electronics,3dqbtj,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Sun Jul 19 13:21:02 2015 UTC,"The reason we left that hardware bug in there was because we were operating under a penalty contract for the development of this new product, and we were already behind and paying penalties. Once it was discovered that a fast software fix could fix the problem, we plowed forward with the dumbest, but fastest path. That A/D board had been used for about 8 years, and after we finished, somebody went back and looked at the old code of the master processor in that design, and found that they were making 5 quick queries to the card, throwing out any ""bad data"", and taking an average. The ""bad data"" they were throwing out was the lack of response to the first query. It seems the design was flawed from day one, but because of the way they were using it and the filter for bad data, they never realized it. The original designers of that were no longer working at the company, so we had nobody to ask about this.  In the new design we were not requesting bursts of data from the card, and only by chance when requests were close together did we get a reply. The guys going through the software didn't notice that the replies had to do with timing.  I wrote software and designed hardware, but the other guys were mostly software coders, so this hardware bug really threw them for a loop, and they didn't know how to operate a scope.  After two weeks of paying penalties, and bringing development to a halt to chase this bug, I found it in about a half hour. Wow, was everybody relieved. Management was having conniption fits.  And I suppose somebody put a comment deep in the code somewhere, but I bet that in the next redesign that A/D card was upgraded anyway, because it was already a bit old.  That happens a lot in companies that have a lot of old designs and are undergoing R&D, and attempting to re-use old components. The people who designed the old stuff are gone, and the oddities of the design are not known."

Finally we notice that the RTCC only counts when probing the crystal - our advisor helped us figure out that we used the wrong capacitance with our crystal, but the probe's capacitance brought the total capacitance into the right range. Changed out the capacitors, and everything worked great.  Not necessarily a bug, more of a design issue.

It was floating one direction for the temperature/humidity in the factory(China) and floating the other direction in our office in California -- at least for the few units that got shipped to us.

Lots of head scratching later, it was one of the old analog gurus who figured it out. The rotor was not centered in the stator of this particular motor. When idle, the largest part of the current draw was the magnetizing current and since the rotor wasn't centered, it was imbalanced. When under load the largest part of the current draw was the load current, which was pretty well balanced.  The solution was to ignore current imbalances which were present when the total current draw was under 25% of the motor rated current. No harm to the motor since the imbalance was under no load conditions, and no compromising the actual motor protection since under load we were monitoring the imbalance."

My '82 Escort would stall on the way to work, but only when I was 2 miles from home, came to a stop on a slight uphill, and when accelerating from the stop. It stalled there several times and took several minutes before I could restart it. It never stalled any other time.   I had recently done a tuneup with new plugs, wires, rotor, and cap. While checking the timing for the tenth time, I noticed that the timing light flashed twice instead of once per revolution. If I moved the ignition wires apart by an inch the double flash stopped. It turns out that the routing of the new wires was not the same as the original and it was causing enough crosstalk between the parallel wires to cause a misfire. It was strange that it only affected the engine under very specific circumstances. I re-routed plug wires and never had that problem again."

Took it in to the guy, he couldn't find anything wrong, raised the idle.  So now it was idling kind of high most of the time.  At this point I took it to the Toyo dealer, they looked at it and said about 4 of the 20-ish vacuum hoses were in the wrong place.  Never went back to the independent guy."

Eventually found a Signetics app engineer who told me ""you didn't hear this from me, but put your parts in the fridge for an hour before you program them.""  Worked like a charm.  2) One of the old Zilog UARTS  required a double write to one of it's registers for it to work properly.  They didn't document it in the manual/datasheet, you only figured it out by looking at their example code in the appendix.    3) One of the 8086 peripherals ( I think it was a PIO of some sort) had some memory in it that was very sensitive to supply noise.  We had a software engineer that decide it was a good place to stick the status and the associated display codes.  Every once in a while the box would go nuts and display garbage.  After I figured it out, it took a week to convince him that he couldn't ""fix"" it in software and to just stop using the memory in that part.  4) The AD TS101 DSP Linkports needed to be biased a certain way when powering up, or they sometimes try to Linkport boot.  This wasn't well documented early on, leading to intermittent head scratching.  ""Errata: needs extra external bias resistors in addition to the internal ones.""  5) we have had systems before that could have power on their interfaces (similar to hotswap kind of stuff), and so the test department would leave power on the test equipment while cycling power on repetitive testing. But we sometimes found that the interface voltages could bleed through interface chips and power the system just enough to maintain the memory, affecting the test results.  6) We had a very sensitive sensor system that if overexposed to the environment it was measuring would become non-functional for days or weeks and then gradually regain its capability.  I was later tasked with designing a feedback methodology that sensed the exceedance to protect the sensor, but determined that by the time the sensor measured it, it was too late.  Eventually had to add another sensor that protected the highly sensitive one.  These are just a few that were particularly troublesome to figure out (mostly because they were intermittent, give me a hard 100% fail condition any day).  I was the guy they always called in when things didn't work and the designing engineer couldn't figure it out, so there were a lot more that were simple ""designer fucked up"" situations as well."

The trouble alarm came in and cleared and a second alarm indicating a relay out of commanded position was in for GP1 (general purpose relay #1) but again this was also cleared.  If you were to reset the alarm it would immediately come back in. Turns out GP1 was configured to drive the alarm light in the control room. The relay had a bad contact and the contact scanner was picking it up as out of position which generated an alarm which commanded this relay to activate to light the trouble light in the control room but also clearing the relay alarm.

Everything was going fine until I put it in the temperature chamber, where it completely broke down at high temperature.  What actually happened was the high temperature damaged some indicator LEDs on the EV kit, making them act like photodiodes.  The output I was looking at would flatline if there was no light shining on them, so the door of the temperature chamber being on was the real problem.  The solution was to just desolder the indicator LEDs."

I didn't care to do up a microcontroller for it, so found an IR decoder IC which provided a binary output representing the pressed key on the transmitter, and made of a set of 4013s to provide control for them.  The genius bit was making an upgrade for my One ForAll JP1 universal remote (the ones with the 2x3 pin header in the battery compartment) which I was getting quite adept at programming, for the decoder IC do decode, and with that, the data to provide binary outputs to control my 4013s, including capacitors to fudge the timing."

Installing the TRS connector was easier since there were only 3 wires I had to connect (left earphone - green wire, right earphone - red wire, ground - copper wire). I prepared them by burning off the enamel with a lighter.  Since the TRS plug is small and moves a lot, I used a clothes pin to hold it in place. It's saved me from constantly burning my fingers and the rest of my sanity.   I looped the exposed wire through the holes in the contact, helping it stay put. I would gently tug the wire to make sure the solder connected.   I found it useful to actually put the headphones on - when the solder is connecting the wire and conductor, you hear static coming from the earbuds.  The thing is, the sound on my headphones goes in and out - I don't think the solder connection is strong/clean enough.   Question about soldering:  I'm having trouble getting the solder where I want it to go. I've been touching the solder to the iron tip, but the melted solder isn't rolling off.  Have I been doing it wrong? Should I be heating up the actual conductor and then touching the solder to contact point?"

The wires connecting to the jack are the failure point and they take a decent amount of abuse since they're constantly being yanked out and carried in my pockets.

There comes transistors, like P-FET your friend recommended. Transistors switch electronic signals allowing steering electronics signals using smaller ones If using a BJT transistor, you steer base current, which is very small (coming for an Arduino pin), bigger current coming from collector to emmiter. In FETs you steer source voltage using gate voltage. So, if you connect your LED and power supply to transistor, you will able to steer this LED more safe than using bare pins.

electronics,3dln07,patricktlo,2,Fri Jul 17 15:53:28 2015 UTC,"not when the MOSFET is operated as an on/off switch, no.  In fact the reverse is true: people purchase special purpose integrated circuits called ""MOSFET Gate Drivers"" whose purpose is to drive the gate as hard as possibly so it slews as quickly as possible.  The IC that I often use is the Microchip TC4421, because it delivers nine amperes (!) to the gate of the MOSFET.  9 amps and series resistors are mutually exclusive.  Some people use MOSFETs in linear applications such as high power audio amplifiers.  In those applications, a BJT would usually have a ""base stopper"" resistor in series with the base, and the corresponding MOSFET circuit does indeed have a ""gate stopper"" resistor in series with the gate.  These resistors stop parasitic oscillation, hence the name stopper.  The Original Poster is using his MOSFETs as on/off switches (at high speed for pulse width modulation) and therefore needs no gate resistors.  Since the load is relatively tiny, he can use a relatively tiny MOSFET, whose gate the microcontroller can directly drive with no need of a separate gate-driver IC.  On the other hand if he were switching a 25 ampere motor ...."

The speed of the switching (slew rate)?   I also though you would put a series resistor in a switching application to reduce high speed ringing of the FET, I don't remember where I read that though.   Also, wouldn't it be a nice idea to put a resistor between gate and source to ensure the FET is off when there's no voltage at the gate?"
electronics,3dln07,patricktlo,3,Sat Jul 18 02:26:25 2015 UTC,"You can see here how much current the pins of the Arduino can source. To roughly paraphrase: Max 40mA per pin, 100mA per port, 200mA for the whole Arduino. Recommended 20mA per pin. Provided you select your resistors appropriately, it is completely legitimate to supply regular LEDs directly from the Arduino. FETs would be necessary if you wanted to use high power (e.g. 1W) LEDs .   You could use this opportunity to learn about FETs, but at your stage they aren't necessary yet."

But one rgb? Nope. I have the very basic transistors and resistors to change the original circuit to the way that lets the micro controller do its job and tell the other components what to do.  It appears I'm going to need to split power, from the same supply, to the duino and breadboard components. I guess this is one way to learn. Figure out a major piece of the puzzle you need then do testing and basic calculations to determine how to modify the circuit.  I'm guessing if I only want to run a single rgb, then bjt could maybe do it. More than one, then I need beefier components down the line to do the heavy lifting. So to speak."

electronics,3dm2tu,hoonkai,4,Fri Jul 17 11:06:38 2015 UTC,"18650's can range in length from 65mm to 72mm depending on if it has protection and a flat or button top.  They're also heavier, so a bigger stronger spring helps it maintain contact.  I had a 26650 flashlight I used on my bike, and on bumpy sections of the road it would momentarily lose contact, which the driver interpreted as a half click to change modes."
electronics,3dm2tu,atetuna,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:45:25 2015 UTC,"Some cells with protection built in are longer, but only by a couple of mm. I can't tell from the pic how long the spring is.   Also, you can get more current out of a 18650 than a AA so it needs more spring force."
electronics,3dm2tu,whitcwa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:48 2015 UTC,"The spring is 16mm long. How come  greater spring force is needed for higher current? For better contact? But that ultimately depends on the case length, ie the distance between the spring and the pad, right?"
electronics,3dm2tu,whitcwa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:56:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, more force for higher current. Plugging in a 2 pin AC cord takes more force than a 19 pin HDMI cable."
electronics,3dm2tu,whitcwa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:12:09 2015 UTC,"Sure, but what is the rationale here for more spring force? Typical 18650s give like 4A @ 3.7V whilst AAs give like 1A."

electronics,3dguuv,grendel_x86,7,Thu Jul 16 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"I needed one when I was building my Minimoog clone project.  I wanted to preserve the analog signal path but I was replacing the keyboard and left hand controller circuits with digital.  The LHC had a couple of potentiometers in it (pitch bend and mod wheel).  I couldn't find a vactrol that was the right value and didn't cost a mint, so I made one with a photocell, an LED, and heat shrink.  I managed the LED brightness with a PWM signal.  I adjusted the response curve in software to get it just right, and sure enough it worked like a charm.  It felt a little hackish, but then again, it was controlling some 1960s style analog audio circuitry built on 100% discrete components, which in itself was loaded with hackery from the mind of Bob Moog.  Study those schematics man, there's tons of stuff in there where you're like ""What the hell did he do that for?""  I left it all intact, but there are many places where there's completely redundant circuits and sense lines that do absolutely nothing."
electronics,3dguuv,MrSparkle666,4,Thu Jul 16 09:00:42 2015 UTC,"I've heard that the redundant circuits are a form of copy protection. If someone makes a synthesiser and it's got those circuits, then they obviously ripped off Moog.  No confirmation on it, though."
electronics,3dguuv,3DBeerGoggles,2,Thu Jul 16 11:17:00 2015 UTC,"The redundancy can be for failure-prone segments. Moogs stuff is pretty tolerant of failures. It could also be used to deal with component variations (average the outputs).   Looking at his / their stuff, you kinda get the feeling if something looks weird, it's not a mistake, it's a genius solution you don't understand."
electronics,3dguuv,EveryoneIsFondOfOwls,5,Thu Jul 16 14:50:07 2015 UTC,"The best option on the cheap is to DIY. They are essentially just an LDR and LED in an opaque package. Most people use heat shrink tubing. It's dead simple to build, but takes some tweaking and experimenting to get the response dialed in how you want it. What you are paying for in the commercial packages is mostly consistency in response, so that they can be dropped in a design and just work as intended, but similar results can be achieved for a fraction of the cost using DIY methods. It's just only really feasible for one-off designs."
electronics,3dguuv,LyraeSchmyrae,2,Thu Jul 16 11:16:47 2015 UTC,"Just a reminder for people replacing them - some equipment relied on light-bulb coupled circuits, and their associated lighting curve.

Design - Stickvise is small and easy to tuck away when not in use, you can adjust the jaws quickly to pop a PCB into the vise, it is low profile and holds a PCB much closer to the table top.  I have a 328, it's not a terrible tool and I don't want to badmouth them, but Stickvise has double the opening and is 1/5 the size.

In fact even 3d printed jaw plates work great, and that material melts more easily than the nylon.  If you are familiar with Panavise, they use nylon jaws for all of their vises which people solder with all the time.

You'll only need it for like half an hour. If you try to desolder the jack using an iron, it takes a while to get all the solder on all the pins to be hot enough to melt, and by then you might have damaged some surrounding components.   Lead solder is easier to use, and it's not like you'll be eating off your motherboard."
electronics,3dka01,MATlad,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:06:36 2015 UTC,"I think most consumer electronics these days are RoHS (i.e. lead free)--you'll probably need some flux (not acid-based plumbing flux, but electronic flux, preferably no clean or a non-corrosive formulation) to break the surface oxide and get it started.    Unfortunately, you need to be able to pump a lot of power in and maintain your temperature.  RadioShack specials won't do the deal.  A Fry's special would, though (Hakko FX-888, a very decent low-volume temperature-controlled iron).  The aforementioned assumes that the DC jack hasn't just plain failed and yanked clean off the board (without leaving metal bits behind)--you can probably just replace and redo with lead solder if necessary (you should still clean off the old solder so you don't have some tri or quad-metallic mixture).  If you have a Maker Space near you, you might be able to get some help there, along with the necessary equipment."

My suggestion would be to first investigate what needs to be measured and what sensors are available to measure it.

Out of the box, these sensors are inaccurate and inconsistent, but there are methods for calibrating them (I can link a few papers which discuss this topic) which make them a whole lot more useful, and even comparable to professional equipment.

I work for a large compant, and the cost of a few electronic components is immaterial here.  I buy 'em and don't save the receipt.  Anyway, I choose the parts that best fit the design, and free samples makes no difference at all to my decision process.  It seems to me that the smaller companies and design places, and engineers still in school, are where the free samples should be sent.  Also, sensible engineers prefer to use common parts that are well understood by hobbyists, rather than snowflake parts only supported by their manufacturer.  So there's a strong argument for seeding the hobbyist crowd with a bunch of free parts.  If you send me free stuff that I didn't ask for, it goes in the bottom desk drawer, but a hobbyist will take time to use your part and maybe publish what they did with it."

electronics,3dfraq,frankielicious,3,Thu Jul 16 00:45:51 2015 UTC,"Essentially. Atmel has good documentation on the method. If you want n extra bits of resolution, you take 4n extra samples, sum them all, then shift the bits right n times.   Example. I have a 10bit ADC, and I want 13bit resolution. I would sum 64 samples, then bitshift right 3 times."
electronics,3dfraq,dimitrifromparis,2,Thu Jul 16 01:13:11 2015 UTC,"Practically, how valid is that? For example if a digitizer handled all precision beyond it's finest resolution by rounding down, there are inputs where oversampling can't give you any better resolution. (for example an intermediate constant input)"
electronics,3dfraq,kubutulur,2,Thu Jul 16 01:28:04 2015 UTC,"The theory is that the signal you're sampling will have some Gaussian noise. With over sampling, you get the mean of all the samples and the least significant bits won't be the same for every sample. So those extra bits are like a decimal point in base ten math, but now you have it as an integer number.   If you have no noise in your signal, then you will not improve resolution at all.   Check this out."
electronics,3dfraq,nikomo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:42:02 2015 UTC,"The rounding error will accumulate, but you can treat that as a fixed offset.  For example, if it always rounds down, and it should have rounded up in half of the cases, then the error is half the number of averages.  If there isn't enough noise to give you as 50:50 chance, you can add noise (""dithering"") to the signal, ideally something that is neutral after the digital low pass filter (averaging is a low pass, but ideally you'd use something with a better windowing function if you have a dither signal overlaid)."

If you over sample in the presence of zero-mean noise, the measured value with over sampling will always be closer to the actual value than with a single sample. If you observe biased noise, then there is an inherent problem with the system that would need to be isolated."

electronics,3dh3cf,sbarratt,16,Thu Jul 16 05:40:16 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming you're talking about the large number of small SMT components seen on boards around ICs. The majority of these parts are generally capacitors and resistors surrounding parts like processors, FPGAS, memory devices, and other digital ICs.   The 'decoupling' capacitors are there to provide a source of local, low impedance charge storage so that the voltage at the part stays witin tolerance during operation. They are needed because digital parts have signals that switch very fast, and produce sudden, but short in duration, current spikes. A power supply inches away from the part or on a different board cannot supply this current, so without a capacitor there, the voltage at the part would look very noisy and could cause improper operation of the IC. Even though most PCBs have large 'planes' to connect power supplies to components, remember that inductance is primarily dominated by the length of a conductor, and that the impedance of that plane becomes dominated by its inductance at higher frequencies. The plane provides a small amount of capacitance, but digital ICs usually need many small capacitors very near to the part in order to operate reliably. They are very inexpensive (think, $10 per reel of 10000), so if board space is there they are liberally applied. A good design rule is to always have at least one  0.1uF capacitor on each power rail of an IC. A part like a large CPU or FPGA will have many more.   The majority of resistors you see are typically attached to I/O on these digital ICs. Most inputs on parts need to be pulled up (Vcc) or down (Gnd) to a known logic state with a resistor, most commonly, a 10K Ohm. These 'pull-up' or 'pull-down' resistors make sure the input goes to a valid logic level if they stop being driven. The other common use of resistors is to help impedance matching on high speed signals. You will often see small, 10-100 Ohm resistors in series with the signals close to where the signal is being driven from. This helps signal integrity, e.g., reflections, overshoot, monotonicity.   These are just some uses of these parts, but are the most common by volume in my experience."

Jack would take out his wirecutters and snip capacitors off the printed circuit board while an engineer was working.  If the Commodore didn't crash, Jack would exclaim ""See!

And as an added benefit, the LEDs' light will be fairly constant as long as the power source can keep pushing sufficient current through them.  If you arrange your LEDs in a series-parallel array you can rig up a pretty simple (albeit relatively inefficient, at 40-60% depending on supply and LED array voltage differential) constant-current regulator using a NPN transistor, a power MOSFET as the pass device, and a few resistors. (Or, for more even light output, parallel LED strings with separate CC regulators on each.)  Basic example of a simple MOSFET-pass constant-current regulator  If your LEDs are low-current (<100mA) you can pretty easily build a proper regulator with all surface-mount parts and it'll be tiny, or use through-hole parts if you don't mind the extra bulk or are running high current levels (read: pushing an amp or more through a big array or some high-power LEDs)."
electronics,3dgeg1,WebMaka,2,Thu Jul 16 04:14:16 2015 UTC,"All commercial (read: OEM) LED drivers in automotive are done using switch-mode constant-current drivers for the LEDs for this very reason. These devices are a lot higher in efficiency (typically 80%+), but become very complex very quickly when attempting to make your own.  Red/amber LEDs are usually lower voltage thus allowing you to place more of them in a series string before you hit the minimum voltage from your battery (10.5V I think?). This is important, because then you can use the reference design from a simple buck constant current driver like the AL8807 to drive the LEDs (up to 1.2A with heat-sinking I believe). Other constant current switch-mode driver solutions may be much more complicated, but I've used the AL8807 in the past to make simple constant-current, high efficiency LED drivers for a few projects - highly recommend it as it also has a control pin for PWM if required."

electronics,3d9ocd,furyfairy,18,Tue Jul 14 17:18:00 2015 UTC,Moore's law doesn't work in space. Newer chips have smaller features which are more sensitive to cosmic radiation.
electronics,3d9ocd,Icehoot,11,Tue Jul 14 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"Actually, smaller processes lend themselves to better radiation performance for certain classes of effects. Low core voltages, and a silicon-on-insulator construction almost entirely remove the micro latch-up condition.  SEUs though are still very much a concern and have to be mitigated in hardware and/or software."
electronics,3d9ocd,m44v,2,Tue Jul 14 19:17:54 2015 UTC,Low core voltages   Wouldn't that give noise immunity issues?
electronics,3d9ocd,Icehoot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:33:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, for discrete logic chips (like newer 74-series parts in the AUP or AVC families), 1.8V would eat into noise margin. However since we're talking an integrated IC, that is less of a problem -- large ASICs started dropping to 2.5V/1.8V in the late 90s/early 00s, and now 1.0V core voltage is not un-common.  For low-voltage data transmission, differential (LVDS, SSTL, etc) is another option to increase noise margin.  Latch-up is caused by a charged particle depositing enough energy into the part to trigger the parasitic BJT (SCR to be specific) that exists as a side-effect of MOS construction in most applications. Triple-well junction isolation, shallow trench isolation and a few other process techniques can be used to reduce this risk for MSI logic / smaller parts, and SOI being a necessity for high-performance ICs bypasses the issue neatly as the part sits on an insulative substrate."
electronics,3d9ocd,fuzzthegreat,9,Tue Jul 14 20:15:13 2015 UTC,"More than likely the CPU specification and selection happened very early in the overall design process which may have been well before it got funding in 2001.  At the time of design they probably specified a chip that had been well-characterized and known to the programs that had developed the design which may mean a rad-hardened chip that had been in production for a few years at least.  That puts us at a chip that might have been designed for radiation in 95 or 96.   To this day they still launch processors which meet characterization and fault tolerance requirements over raw mhz speed.  The curiosity rover, for instance, launched with a ~100mhz processor called the RAD750"

electronics,3d9ocd,more_amps,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:52:34 2015 UTC,"Generally in space probe/launch vehicle avionics, the initial specifications are drawn up long before the probe is even close to finished. When the Space Shuttle lifted off with Crippen and Young in 1981, it was basically flying the best of late-60's/early-70's avionics tech. Also, radiation-hardened processors have far longer development and qualification timeframes. You also need to factor in the amount of documentation, board-level support and development tools that must be delivered with the processor and flight-qualified.  All that being said, some of the newer space capsules being developed today are getting processors in the > 100 MHz clock speed range. I believe the FCMs (Flight Control Modules) on Orion have clock speeds in the 900 MHz range, and spacecraft that are going to fly LEO missions for Commercial Crew are sometimes dispensing with the need to get radiation-hardened processors, opting instead to fly with redundant sets of radiation-tolerant CPU's that are easier to source (I think the SpaceX Dragon is a good example of such an architecture)."

electronics,3ddrgs,classicsat,0,Wed Jul 15 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"Hmmm, when your amplifier's output waveform is a ±12V sinewave, that delivers (12/sqrt(2))2 / 4 = 18 watts RMS, to the 4 ohm loudspeaker load.  Therefore your 12V LED will remain dark and unlit, until the amplifier output power is 18 watts.  Is that what you want?  18 watts of output is very, very loud.  Maybe you might reconsider and either (a) use lower voltage LEDs, or else (b) drive the LEDs from a gizmo that has its own power supply, so you can light up an LED when the amplifier is only supplying, say, 1 watt to the loudspeaker .... if that's what you want."
electronics,3ddrgs,fatangaboo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:37:37 2015 UTC,"18W is not very loud when you have speakers near 80dB/W/m, and you take into account human hearing response at low frequency (~40dB difference between audibility thresholds of 20Hz and 2kHz)"
electronics,3ddrgs,Stonegray,0,Wed Jul 15 16:16:12 2015 UTC,"How much voltage the LEDs get will depend on the volume level of the amplifier and the input signal  So as long as you don't turn it up too loud the LEDs will be fine, but you'll need to stick an RMS multimeter on the output or something to get an idea of the voltage at first  The other alternative is to make a LED driver that doesn't utilize the output of the amplifier at all, but instead uses the low level input signal and uses a MOSFET to switch the LEDs"
electronics,3ddrgs,wolfcry0,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:16:07 2015 UTC,Be careful your LED driver doesn't accidentally DC-bias the line level signal. This can destroy your amplifier and speakers.
electronics,3ddrgs,Stonegray,0,Wed Jul 15 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"So you have an 800W amplifier, into 4Ω. Ohms law says that that amplifier is capable of nearly 60 volts, which will definitely destroy your LEDs.   It's possible to do this safely by using pairs of LEDs wired and current limited so that they draw equal current when the polarity of the waveform inverts, but it's easier and safer to just pick up a led driver with sound control."

A recent test was done on the EEVBlog forum for robustness and this meter came in second to the Fluke 101. The input protection is top notch, the only thing of note is it is an averaging meter not a TrueRMS meter. At 56 euro's it is well below your budget. You could afford to get TWO, which is not a bad idea because you often need two when doing power measurements. There is also the AM-530 which adds TrueRMS.   Brymen BM257S - a very solid meter and one of the best values in its price range. Robust input protection and solid specs.  EDIT:  Brymen BM829S - This is right at the top of your price range but it adds a lot of features that you might find useful in the future. This meter is loaded with features not found on any other meter in this price range, in particular CAT IV 1kV input protections. It also has AC+DC TrueRMS (you can break an AC+DC signal down into its various parts) and dual display for faster reading of information.   Uni-T UT139C - This is a low budget meter with OK input protections, much better than the chinese UT61E (but not as good as the European UT61E). It has a lot more features than the UT61E  Uni-T UTT33C - This little meter isn't intended to be your only meter but is a cheap low cost meter that is reasonably safe for what it does. Just good to have around for quick sanity checks and things like that. Also good for loaning out when you don't want ot give someone your quality meter (HRC fuses are expensive).  In general, if you are a hobbyist with a very tight budget, the Amprobe AM-510 is one of the best values overall. I have no qualms about recommending it to people as their only meter.

Does it have the same professional near-ubiquity outside of North America that Fluke has here (yes, yes, I know they're a global brand).

Many of Greenlee's meters are actually rebadged Brymen (DM-860A is a rebadged BM869S, DM-860 is a BM859, another one is a rebadged BM257S, etc.). A few other USA companies also rebrand Brymen meters; several Amprobe lines and the Extech MM series come to mind."

electronics,3d8ne3,PedroDaGr8,2,Wed Jul 15 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think they do much designing anymore. Two of their major lines came from companies they acquired. The XR line is Meterman, the HD line is Wavetek. You can kinda call those internal but the designs originated and were sold outside the company and they absorbed them.  Additionally, the AM-5x0 line is Uni-T made (not sure if designed though). The AM-270, AM-140 and AM-160 are made by Brymen and shown strong signs of Brymen design. The rest of the AM-2x0 line is of unknown origin. The pocket compact line looks a bit like APPA."

Also, not buying from China is indeed silly, you'll get the same meter with a 50-70% markup at some European stores. I've seen the UT61-E for around €80 locally.  If you insist on getting a Fluke or similar, keep in mind that for €150 you'll get a very, very basic model. If you want a decent Fluke, Gossen Metrawatt, Keysight, you should think in the range € 300-500 and more.

I see this situation and I design a scope that costs me $2000 to build, which is much better than your scope, and I sell it for $100 000, and some other guy built a $1000 scope he's selling for $50 000.

AFAIK there is no such thing as a 100GHz ADC.   So you could for example take your signal and use a bunch of frequency converters to get a lot of small bandwidth signals (sort of like how you convert radio signal to intermediate frequency in a superheterodyne amplifier), and put each through a separate ADC (which is itself made of many ADCs working in parallel with a little timing shift for each), and then figure out what the original signal was, in software. This is a lot of parts for 100GHz!  So to summarize - a much more complicated circuit that is much harder to design, a far larger number of parts (many produced in low volume and hence more expensive), and the far higher cost of engineering it (as well as the cost of setting up the process for each chip) is spread over far fewer users. Really, you're getting a bargain with some multimillion dollar monster of a scope. (Which is then used to test multibillion dollar communication designs)"

Falling back to the ones that are only a meager $250K, they're used for USB, PCIe, Ethernet, etc. compliance testing; which is where they connect things like new graphic cards in and see if the electrical signals they're sending are good enough that you can stick it in your motherboard's dusty card slot and expect it to work anyway.  They're that expensive because there's just not that many people who need them, and they're super hard to make.

electronics,3d5ag0,drive2fast,3,Mon Jul 13 19:12:32 2015 UTC,"One of the problem is the marketing, they don't make fully featured scopes at low bandwidth, so even if you don't play with more than a few kHz, you can't get deep memory, advanced maths and triggers, bluetooth and stuff like that at a reasonable price, while it's very very cheap to do at low speed. So in the end, if you want features without bandwidth, you also have to pay for the expensive AD converters, the crazy ram architecture and the high end FPGA to do stuff that you could have done in software."

People using GPL for their KiCAD footprints has always been a PITA because users are very confused about what they can do with them (basically anything they like as far as I can tell -- copyleft has not effect that a simpler license wouldn't).   In many situations, copyright does not cover making physical hardware from a drawing. In these situations, your license for the drawing simply can't exert any control over making or selling physical hardware, regardless of the license you use. When copyright does cover making hardware, for instance with IC masks, the GPL handles that case in a useful way.   https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.en.html#GPLHardware"

The laser printer uses carbon-based toner, which is opaque to IR, visible and UV. Depending on the blackness of your print, if you time the UV exposure carefully, you should get away with a single print - but if you want more leeway in your exposure then printing the mask twice and carefully overlaying the two transparencies will give you even greater density. Arrange your mask so that the toner-side of the transparency rests against the UV-sensitive layer, as this will give better-defined edges.  I'm never tried making UV masks with inkjet, but to be honest I can't see it working. I'd have thought all inkjet inks will use dyes rather than pigments (particles) since the pigments would be expected to block the microscopic ink-jets."""

electronics,3d7fmt,RobinUrthos,3,Tue Jul 14 05:26:31 2015 UTC,might be a defect in the application of whatever coats the tip (which makes the solder stick to it)... or maybe the QA process involves practical testing?  it really just looks like solder though. turning it on probably wont hurt whatever return policy there is. if it's solder it's probably totally fine to use.

electronics,3d6v8s,CakeLore,3,Tue Jul 14 00:00:38 2015 UTC,"Is power ultimately the most important factor in these sorts of operations   That depends entirely on the load being driven.  For resistors, it's really simple - P=VI which gives P=V²/R or P=I²R when you substitute ohm's law - see Ohm's wheel  Anything with a linear regulator will take a fairly constant current as voltage increases above its minimum operating point, and simply produce more waste heat to burn off the extra power.  If instead you're feeding a switchmode power supply, they will take more current at lower voltages to keep the input power the same, and conversely less current at higher voltages.  Other parts like diodes (incl. LEDs) have a very sharp cliff where the current goes from near zero to very high with a change of just a few dozen to hundred millivolts near their ""knee"" - you always have to be mindful of externally limiting the current for these, they'll happily burn themselves if allowed to take what they want.  However in your example of a DC motor, there's all sorts of interesting things going on.  The applied voltage pushes a current through the winding resistance, just like a resistor.  This current (usually) causes the motor to turn, but the rotation of the motor makes it act as a generator which opposes the supply voltage - causing effective voltage and thus current to reduce.  At some high speed, the remaining effective supply voltage can only push barely enough current to keep the motor spinning against bearing and air friction and cannot accelerate it any more. It may be simpler to consider the point where the generated voltage exactly equals the supply voltage, and thus the current (and thus torque) is zero.  This is why DC motors tend to take less current/power at higher speeds!  Sometimes you will see a Kv figure (RPM per volt) listed for motors. This figure tells you how much voltage it will produce at a given rotational speed, and you can estimate the maximum no-load speed by multiplying with your supply voltage.  Thus, if you feed it a lower voltage, it will spin at a slower speed (due to its Kv) and have less torque (due to its winding resistance reducing peak current)  Furthermore, inductors (such as the motor's windings) will only change their magnetic field at a rate proportional to applied voltage. This effect also imposes a theoretical voltage-based speed limit whereby the current in the windings simply cannot change fast enough to keep up with the motor's rotation. I'm not sure if this ever comes into play before the Kv-based limit though - possibly motor designers balance them as part of the design process.  All this tells us that motors are probably best driven with constant current if you want heaps of speed without burning them ;)"

electronics,3d6v8s,Linker3000,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:17:52 2015 UTC,Power supplies are generally either constant voltage (CV) or constant current (CC). Most are CV. A CV power supply puts out a constant (or nearly so) voltage no matter what load is connected as long as you don't exceed the current rating.   A CC supply has a voltage limit when it is unloaded (compliance voltage) and can supply a constant current as long as the load is low enough for the voltage to drop below the compliance voltage.   We usually don't use constant power (CP) power supplies because we want to specify the voltage OR the current.  You can't set a power supply to provide 1A at 1V unless a 1ohm resistor is connected to it.

My system will never provide 12v because my battery just won't provide it, and I'm not entirely sure what my actual total amperage requirement will be. I know it shouldn't be more than 15 amps so I'm using that as my basis for the cut off current. At this point I'm thinking a car fuse is probably my best option because they're already intended for a 12v system, easily replaceable, and can be locally sourced.

electronics,3cwvsp,greevous00,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:38:57 2015 UTC,"I never properly diagnosed. I was using LED drivers with integrated shifting logic that buffered the clock signal at each stage which I suspect mashed up the clock signal after a few hundred buffers. This leads to the last couple thousand registers intermittently not showing correct data. In the end, we ""solved"" the problem with better grounding and RG-174 coax for all longish clock and data lines. We still have these flicker issues, but they have gotten rare enough.  If you tried to use a single, long clock line for all shift registers you would get problems with signal propagation delay, trace impedance and loading of whatever line driver you are using by several hundred CMOS inputs.  You can probably reliably cascade thousands of shift registers, but you need to pay serious concern to signal integrity and timing, keep everything close by to reduce ground loops and shield the thing against capacitive coupling (both in and out)."
electronics,3cwvsp,jaseg,6,Sun Jul 12 10:21:08 2015 UTC,"The work is tidy and I'm sure it makes a nicely lit display. I get a lot of satisfaction on segmented displays myself as well.  On your next hand made or PCB display from segmented digits, consider a chip like the max6955.  The 10x shift registers used here may still only be $5 while the one 6955 chip is $16, but you got 80 pins of shift registers there to solder or wire wrap, and I don't see them but presumably there's a pile of current limiting resistors somewhere under the digits or the other side (or are you depending on the shift register to limit current? Maybe the common terminal of each digit has a resistor, but that would make a ""1"" way brighter than a ""W""). Maybe really zero resistors?  At first I thought the shifters were used to make a scanning matrix-wired display, but then here would only need to be 3 total shift registers (16 bits for segment drive, 5 bits for digit drive) but I think you actually have each digit has two dedicated shift registers each driving half the segments of the digit. So you clock out 80 bits and just leave it that way until data changes. How are you current limiting the shift registers output? Your segments of all illuminated on a digit would presumably pull 80-160mA for even 1/2 a digit?  Is the display bright enough when all segments are lit? The 74HC595 can at most source/sink 35mA for the whole chip, so less than 5mA per segment. Most 16 segment displays like you have there can take 20mA continuous current, so you may be only getting 25% of the brightness that display could be doing.  The max6955 can drive up to 40mA per segment, and you can control the brightness of each digit independently via runtime data."
electronics,3cwvsp,scubascratch,4,Sat Jul 11 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"Good tip, thanks.  The displays are common anode, so I have the limit resistor is on there. I'm have yet to put in the data lines to each segment, it sounds like it will probably look better (and be easier to wire!) if I scan across each like you describe."
electronics,3cwvsp,LyraeSchmyrae,6,Sun Jul 12 00:38:31 2015 UTC,"If I understand correctly, you have a single resistor on the common anode limiting current to all segments per digit?  If this is the case, you're going to have a lot of segment brightness issues.   Having multiple segments on at the same time will be relying on the LED voltage drops and IV curves to be perfectly matched with each other, which rarely happens. So you end up with randomly different brightness on each segment and it looks really patchy (some might not even turn on at all)  The second issue is the more segment leds you have on at the same time, the more the current through the single resistor will be split among them. Since each led is going to have a fairly constant voltage drop across it, the resistor will too (supply - drop) and therefore will be sinking a fairly constant current, no matter how many leds are connected to it. So the more leds you have on at the same time, the more the same constant current is split up along different paths. AKA the more segments that are on, the dimmer the display gets.  Sorry if I just misunderstood!"

B) dedicated shifters per digit or scanned display with less shifters  First about point A): you want the resistors on the segments not the common pin.  This will then have one segment lit will be just as bright as all 16 segments. (Also I bet if you look very close at the data sheet of your digits, it bet you will find they say something like ""max segment current: 20mA (10mA D.P.)"" which means you should drive a little less current through the Decimal Point led because it's a smaller die)  On design point B) (dedicated shifts vs. scanning) Scanning is usually preferred, because it's always less total parts which is lower cost and less effort to wire. But 2 important sub points: software driver and brightness duty cycle:  B1) the software to scan with shift registers is not hard but not trivial. It becomes a nested loop: outer loop for each digit, shift in that digit's common bit and all others off, and then another nested inner loop shifting out each of 16 segment bits for that digit's current character. You have to wait with the shift registers in this state to keep that digit illuminated for like 20ms, then turn it off and move to next digit (outer loop). You have to have this whole loop arrangement running all the time, forever because if you stop, or don't call it, the display will be stuck on its last digit or just off (the preferred code blanks the whole display between scans, or else you get bright last digit syndrome). You can do this in easy arduino code, usually you eventually find interrupt driven is best. If the microcontroller has a lot of other work to do, scanning might get in the way. You might wind up wanting to dedicate a small simple controller like an ATTiny to this.  B2) brightness vs duty cycle  In scanned multiplexed displays like this, each digit is only actually turned on for at most 1/(# digits) of the total time.  So a 5 digit display, each digit is switched on 20% of time and off 80% of time (when other digits are on). So each digit, only being on 20%!of the total time, will look DIM. The whole thing will look DIM. What you then do is force 5x the normal current you would usually use. If the digit usually wants 10mA to light up? You use 50mA but you promise promise fingers crossed! That it will only be on for 20% of the time. Super important promise! The LED digit will be totally ok with this and if you look close at that led datasheet it will say something like ""segment current typical: 20mA max"" followed by ""Peak segment current: 200mA (10% duty cycle)"" or something similar. Choose resistors for the peak value. By they way when you write this code and you try and get clever when displaying only a 2 digit number, you still got to dwell time on all 5 digits even the off ones)"

electronics,3cwvsp,LyraeSchmyrae,5,Sat Jul 11 18:22:42 2015 UTC,"POV stands for Persistence Of Vision. It's a way of displaying numerous LEDs by switching between outputs to save yourself pins (and I would think power as well - don't quote me on that). In this case, you would light up the number on display 1 for a time, switch to display 2, light up a number, etc. This is where you start hearing about refresh rates in monitors and what not.  So to answer your question I don't think it would be called a driver so much as an effect."

electronics,3cwvsp,gmarsh23,3,Sat Jul 11 19:00:57 2015 UTC,"You would essentially wire each segment on the first digit to the corresponding segments on the subsequent digits...Then, one (or how ever many it takes) shift register handles which segments are turned on, and you have a second (again, maybe more depending on how many digits you use) that controls which digit is active by switching the VCC and GND of each digit...Then you just loop through them, re-writing the appropriate data for the active digit each time.  The trick being that your eyes can't tell that everything is basically blinking on and off as long as you cycle through fast enough.  If you have seen the LED Cubes, this is how they are able to control  an 8x8x8 cube of LEDs with only 9 shift registers (one for each row of 8 on the X & Y axis and one to cycle through the Z layers).  Without using POV in this way, you would need 64 of them to control all 512 LEDs at the same time...Not to mention, if all the LEDs were actually lit at the same time, the power draw would be incredibly high...  Keep in mind though, this can also mean adding some transistors into the mix if, such as in the case of an LED cube, you have one pin on a shift register providing or sinking too much power...For example, one Z-axis pin of an 8x8x8 led cube may have to power a whole layer (8x8 = 64) worth of LEDs at once, which it would burn it out...Instead, you just use that low power output to trigger a transistor beefy enough to handle it.  Hope I did not ramble too much, over complicate, or over simplify my comment...Basically though, BUILD AN LED CUBE!!! Tons of fun, they look awesome, and you will learn a lot from the wiring and programming of one.  EDIT for more rambling:  If you were using a display that combined multiple digits into one unit, you would likely find that it was built to be use in exactly this way...I know the first time I ordered a 4 digit LED display, I was extremely confused by the fact that it had MANY fewer pins than I was expecting."

electronics,3cwvsp,LyraeSchmyrae,4,Sun Jul 12 03:54:17 2015 UTC,"I think people building displays from shift registers probably don't realize there are newer, easier, more efficient, way less chip count, and way less-wirey (maybe 80% less wires) chips to solve this. They are even prototype friendly DIP chips.  For displays made with digits of 7/8 segment look at MAX7219/7221  It's a few bucks more than a couple shift registers but way less total chips and wires and resistors and transistors. Also a lot more flexible: programmable brightness! Also will drive more current than most shift registers. And it is in DIP form so easily breadboardable. Also only uses two pins for data like the shift register data bus, but you can also do blink, brightness, blanking, and numeric/hex font decode.  For the 16 segment digits used by OP, maxim has a MAX6955 a more advanced version but is also easy, flexible, full ascii character font, and saves many many parts. This 1 chip would replace all ten shift registers in OP pic and make display probably 2-4x brighter.  Also, both the above devices are constant current: every segment has equal current / brightness (except where you decide to dim). The digits don't get brighter or dimmer depending on how many are lit or how many segments / what glyph is shown.  & these devices are highly efficient: 90%+ power is dissipated in the display, not in the resistor-heater-ballast needed in a bright shift reg display.  I don't mean to sound like a maxim rep I'm not, I just built several old displays then found these and haven't looked back once. Some people go ""ugh, $10"" but seriously any project like this is hours or days or weeks of work. An extra $10 is gonna break the bank?  It's cool everyone should do at least one decent display with shift registers but then move on. I mean most people learn to program at first with everything in one big main function.

For youw specific question, you need Ohms law and a little knowledge of how led circuits work. A LED has a voltage drop instead of a resistance, you can find this in the datasheet. You should also know the maximum current.   If you bought the led from a source that doesn't supply datasheets, you should find a similar looking one in the same color.  For example with this we have a voltage drop (aka forward voltage) of 2 V, and a maximum (DC Forward) current of 30 mA. So let's say we use it at 2V, 30 mA, which is the maximum.  The battery gives 9V. The Led ""uses"" 2V, so over the rest of the circuit we should count on 7V. Let's use a resistor for that. We connect the negative pole of the battery to the correct lead of the led, the other lead of the led to the resistor, and the other lead of the resistor to the positive end of the battery.  With Ohms law we know that V = IR, so R = V/I = 7V/30mA = 233 ohm. So anything bigger than that should be fine."
electronics,3cwitn,elsjaako,5,Sat Jul 11 11:30:25 2015 UTC,"Like transistor ""a"" works in circuit ""b"" but not in circuit ""c"".   This is an enormously complicated question, believe it or not.  Transistors are basically ""amplifiers"" in the sense that they take a small input signal and use it to control a larger signal.  However, the manner in how they react to an input current varies greatly.  Some transistors basically act like switches -- if they sense any input current, they turn on.  Some act more like current controlled amplifiers, and the amount of change in the output signal follows the amount of current at the input signal.    There are many classes of transistors for various purposes.  They vary along these lines:  what they're made of (germanium, silicon, gallium arsenide, etc.), how they're structured (BJT, JFET, MOSFET, etc.), whether they're polarized or not (some are, some aren't), power rating, how fast they react to an input signal, intended purpose (switch, amplifier, general purpose, audio, high voltage, etc.), how they're packaged, junction forward voltage, Hfe (also called beta) which is a measurement of their amplification behavior, and so on.  When I'm experimenting with a transistor, since I'm usually working with low power circuits, I often start with a general purpose transistor of the class I'm anticipating using (like a BJT), look at the data sheets  for one that roughly fits the activation current I'm looking for (if I'm doing switching), or has an Hfe that's in the ballpark (if I'm doing amplification).  I choose resistors that get the current to the right levels for the legs of the transistor, or whatever needs to be done to set up the circuit for what I'm trying to accomplish.  Then, when I get the bugs out of the circuit, and it's more or less doing what I want, I start digging into the other characteristics in the datasheets to find one that's optimal for the circuit I'm using (secondary concerns come into play at that point).  Here's a little picture that I've seen used to help people understand basic transistor theory.  This is a picture of a BJT transistor, so it's polarized.  Imagine that there's a little person inside the transistor watching a gauge on the Base leg.  He watches the current arriving at the Base/Emitter junction, and as it goes up, he changes the value of a potentiometer in the Collector/Emitter to allow more current to flow.  Hfe is a measure of how much he reacts to what he sees in the Base/Emitter gauge.  The speed at which he reacts is also a measurable characteristic.  Like all analogies, this one breaks down if you overthink it, but it's handy to get your brain around transistors -- it works quite well as you're reading and learning about them (you can keep relating each new concept back to ""the little person in the transistor"").  Hope that's helpful.  It took me a few weeks to really start to get a feel for how transistors work in practice.  They're what's called ""active"" components (as compared to resistors and capacitors and such, which are called ""passive"" components), and so they take a little study to understand."

electronics,3cwitn,melector,2,Sat Jul 11 16:19:03 2015 UTC,"I think others have answered your specific circuit examples, so I'll address the title question, ""What math do I need to [design] circuits?""  The point of this post is not to scare you away as a beginner, just to make you realise that real circuit design/research requires quite a bit of mathematical study, along with domain-specific theory. If you don't plan on becoming a professional electrical engineer working on cutting edge IC design, power electronics, etc., you may personally never need anything beyond algebra, linear algebra and understanding the concepts of the frequency domain, derivatives and integrals (without necessarily needing to work with them by hand).  Here's what I use in my day-to-day as a grad student investigating and designing transistor circuits, more or less in order of most to least used. Note that in many cases, knowing how to do things by hand isn't very important, but the fact that I've studied mathematical theory and how to apply it to electrical engineering means I can think of a complicated circuit in terms of those maths, even if everything I'm doing is simulation-based.   Algebra and linear algebra. Obvious one: Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, circuit analysis stuff. Pretty much everything I do involves algebra in some form. Complex analysis. Mostly for Laplace domain stuff, but on occasion when I'm working with power stuff (mostly personal projects), I'll use phasors at a fixed frequency. Laplace domain analysis (frequency domain analysis), pole-zero. This is generally considered pure maths, but in this case it's a bit more an EE technique: no need to know the integral definition or being able to solve it, but being able to derive transfer functions of your circuit model to understand why you're seeing a certain behaviour, or to design a certain behaviour into our circuit in the frequency domain, is very important. The core reasoning behind frequency-domain analysis (usually you learn Fourier series, Fourier transform, Laplace transform) is that you want to be able to know how a circuit reacts to different frequencies—if you want to run an amplifier with 10x gain at low frequencies at 100MHz, will it still amplify 10x or is the output actually going to be 0.1x the input (no good!)? What's the maximum frequency it can amplify ""well""? Does it amplify all frequencies below this max in a consistent way, or does the way it amplifies different frequencies change a bit or a lot here and there? Control system theory. A lot of control system theory ends up being Laplace-domain maths, and those core concepts are crucial to understanding the stability of a circuit. An unstable circuit can diverge and just get ""stuck"" at a rail, or start oscillating (generating its own repeating waveform without that being present at the input). Specific control system models (e.g. PID controller, state feedback) aren't as relevant to circuits, although you can implement a controller as an analog or digital circuit. Control system models are relevant if you're designing power supplies/regulators, phase-locked loops, etc. Linearisation. Pretty simple: transistors are linear, therefore we often take linear approximations when we're designing small-signal analog amplifiers. Differential and integral calculus. ""Thinking in calculus"" is more important than knowing analytical calculus by hand—for example, understanding that a non-linear DC gain can be found as the derivative of a DC sweep, instead of just looking at the sweep and thinking ""well, the curve tapers off at the ends"". One major case of using calculus directly is doing noise analyses and trying to find the total noise of a circuit. Another one is to derivative small-signal expressions for a circuit (for example if you need the overall transconductance gm of a circuit, which is defined as g\m = di/dv). Differential equations. I usually prefer doing Laplace and then switching over to time domain if I need to figure out impulse/step responses by hand, but it can be useful to solve a frequency-dependent circuit in the time domain as an ordinary differential equation."

I'm Filipino so bear with my english...  so i have an old bike and wanted to make it into a magnetic stationary bike but the intensity will be audio controlled from ipod/mp3 player so high volume = steep slope and low volume = flat road. i have old crt boards lying around so i thought i could use it in this project. i have basic to novice electronics and I'm a programmer basically.  there is a lever with a magnet attached so when the magnet is near the metal strip its like an uphill ride. I need help making a solenoid or some sort of controller that will process the music and convert it to lever action.  i found a link for a simple solenoid controller: http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2004/ps237/ECE476project/images/solenoid_driver.gif  edit: link
electronics,3cx0zs,RobinUrthos,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:07:28 2015 UTC,"Alright, you can take the analog route or the digital route.  The digital route is to get an Arduino, a hobby servo, a servo horn to mount the rotor to your lever, a 3.5mm headphone connector, and to condition the signal four 10k resistors and a 1 µF capacitor.  It should be fairly trivial to make a program that measures the loudness of the music and adjusts the servo position accordingly.  This is efficient and simple to design.  The analog route is to use an op-amp and diode to make a precision rectifier, low-pass-filter the rectified signal, connect it to the control pin of a 555 timer chip, and connect the timer chip's output to a hobby servo.  This takes some hand-calculation of the parts needed to give the servo the right signals.    EDIT: you could, instead of the servo in both situations, use a solenoid and driver.  Just choose the right resistors/programming to do the right kind of PWM.  By the way, that solenoid driver circuit you linked lacks a back-EMF protection diode."

The important thing is that in most cases you want the protection circuitry in your application as well.  The one notable exception is R/C where batteries never have internal protection and most planes do not add it externally.  The logic here is that it is better to destroy a battery by running it too low than cut the power mid-flight and lose the whole plane.  This is why R/C LiPos are far more prone to catching fire than those used in other applications.

Every RAM upgrade included a grounding strap, so most of them were thrown away in the nearest trash can.  I was working late one night in one of the labs when a police office knocked on the door.  He showed me one of the grounding straps and asked what it was.  I was very surprised at how interested he was.  I mean, I probably must have spent ten minutes here.  He kept giving me these strange looks, and I even had to go so far as to explain the entire MOS production technique.  He gave up eventually, but even at the end I had the impression he didn't believe a word I said.  So I wrote it off as one of those strange things that happens at 2AM and went back to work.  About a half an hour later it dawned on me -- the cop thought this was a fancy roach clip, and I was just a long-haired hippie yanking his chain.  I did, however, snarf a bunch more of those grounding straps out of the trash -- which made for great gifts along with the story."

You have a glancing contact with one pin of D1. It might be ok if that pin is NC, but you should either have a solid connection or none at all.

I am going to address your points one by one   C1/C2 should be significantly closer to Q1/Q3, as they form a switching loop. You certainly don't want U1 to be inside that loop!   C1/C2 I tried to place closer to U1. I will have a look at rearranging things to bring Q1/Q3 closer to them.   You have a glancing contact with one pin of D1. It might be ok if that pin is NC, but you should either have a solid connection or none at all.   This is two diodes in one package so I just assumed the other one was no connection if I'm not using it but I will move that trace.   I'm not sure what target current you're going for, but the footprint for L1 looks a bit small for anything that needs TO-220 mosfets and synchronous switching.   Target current is no more than 2-3A. Potentially 20W. I don't mind using oversize mosfets, but I wasn't too sure which components needed to be power sized and which would see high voltage but little current. The fat traces are my attempt at marking the power path.   Do you think that inductor is okay for 3A?   Q2 should probably have a larger copper pour for heatsinking, and/or thermal vias to a pour on the back of the board.    I didn't even think of this but now I agree; I will try to add a decent copper pour.    U1 has a thermal pad - usually this means that the chip is expected to produce some heat. You should have either a decent size copper pour on top for this, or a number of thermal vias to the groundplane so that U1 is adequately heatsinked.   Same as above. U1 is a switching converter, ~40V @ .5A -> 12V @ ~1.5 A. I will try to add a copper pour on the top layer.   You seem to have a strange mix of surface mount and through-hole parts. I think you could replace most of the passives with surface mount types and reduce your board area significantly.   This was because I wasn't sure which parts needed which sizes, and also when I first started routing this I found through hole made my job a lot easier. Almost everything is grounded through the back plane, so with SMD resistors and caps I would need to add vias to ground everything, right? Might still be a net gain in space. The ICs are only available as surface mount parts. U101 is pretty much the only chip I could find that does MPPT for a solar panel at V_oc > 40V.

Do you think the connectors are appropriately sized for 3A or should they still be larger?  Regarding the capacitors, I just picked the footprint that was default in my tool. Do you think surface mount capacitors would be appropriate here?   As /u/triffid_hunter[1]  already said, the inductor is most likely to small, will get in saturation to soon and may burn down. Check out the inductor LT used, it is intended for 15A and is 20mm by 20mm!   I will double check the ratings on the inductor.   On the other side your diode is way to big. The original design used a B160 1A 60V diode. A diode in a TO-220 package is most likely able to handle more than 10A of current.   This diode is ridiculously oversized because it was given to us by someone who had some spare parts from a project that handled much higher power.    The footprint of R101 should be rotatet 180°, so the extra pads for the 4-wire measurment are on the side to the IC.   This was done late at night and probably after I should have gone to bed. I am not sure if it matters if the polarity is reversed on the sensing inputs on the IC. If so, I can just make another footprint pattern with the leads going the other way.

Use bigger connectros for solar cell, not for current(the pin header support up to 3A), but for convenience. Easier to handle, won't brake that soon, better to manucature.  Throw some thermal vias under U1, the mosfets, diode and inductor.  Try to seperate the ground from the power path from the rest of the circuit and only connect them at the input connector(to avoid current loops).  The protruding pins for your ""4-wire"" measurment als a bit unnecessary, as you should be able to lay the tracks in the same way, without the conflicts and oriantation problems. There is not so much to gain from these. It is different if you have a proper shunt: http://www.vishay.com/resistors-fixed/list/product-30161/"
electronics,3cs10x,cypherpunks,4,Fri Jul 10 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"Everything /u/triffid_hunter said.  It's a good first draft, but it needs a lot of tweaking.  In any switching power supply identify the switching current loops (those paths which have a large dI/dt) and work hard to minimize their area.  In a buck converter like you have, the fast-changing current loop is through the two switches and the input capacitor(s).  Keeping that loop small and low-inductance is pretty much the most important goal of the entire layout, with the primary opposing tension being the need to heat-sink the components.  Begrudge millimeters.  For example, I'd recommend making C2 surface-mount to save a few mm of lead length.  Second in importance is the gate drives lines, BOOST pin, and compensation network (Vc pin) then the output feedback traces.  Here's a Rohm app note which is in chinglish but covers a lot of the subtleties.  Note Fig. 3 describing the deleterious effect of placing the capacitors on the bottom of the board because the inductance of the through-board vias!  Other notes:   I have no idea why you're mixing surface-mount ICs with through-hole passives.  People are normally scared of hand-soldering the IC packages (especially with thermal pads), while 2-pin passives are easy. It's not clear that your high-power traces are wide enough.  Use very fat traces and flood-fill.  In the switching loop that goes double, because inductance is important as well as resistance. I don't know what device U1 is, but if it has a thermal pad, that normally means that it needs a large copper heatsink.  You should have multiple vias within the pad itself making a direct connection to a large area of bottom copper.  Route other traces away to avoid cutting the bottom copper. The switch node (bounded by the two transistors and inductor) also needs low capacitance.  Keep the copper area of this node reasonably small, and (although this is more important in thinner or multi-layer boards) consider cutting away the bottom copper to reduce capacitance."
electronics,3cs10x,duckfighter,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:56:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I did know to be aware of ground loops but by the time I was done with all the vias and bottom traces to get it routed I wasn't sure if partitioning the ground plane any more would have helped. Also the pins on U1 (which is a step down DC-DC converter) didn't really seem to separate, for example, signals on one side and power signals on the other.   I will have a look at that app note today.   I have no idea why you're mixing surface-mount ICs with through-hole passives. People are normally scared of hand-soldering the IC packages (especially with thermal pads), while 2-pin passives are easy.   I used the ICs because they aren't available in through hole, and I used through hole resistors/caps because I thought they might have better power handling, and because they made routing easier. I think I will try again today to do another draft with surface mount passives.   It's not clear that your high-power traces are wide enough. Use very fat traces and flood-fill. In the switching loop that goes double, because inductance is important as well as resistance.   The power traces shouldn't have to handle more than 1.6A average, and when I plugged 2A into a calculator it said .02"" would be okay. Some of those traces are .04.   I don't know what device U1 is, but if it has a thermal pad, that normally means that it needs a large copper heatsink. You should have multiple vias within the pad itself making a direct connection to a large area of bottom copper. Route other traces away to avoid cutting the bottom copper.   Thanks I will do this.   The switch node (bounded by the two transistors and inductor) also needs low capacitance. Keep the copper area of this node reasonably small, and (although this is more important in thinner or multi-layer boards) consider cutting away the bottom copper to reduce capacitance.   Thanks I did not consider that at all. I will try to incorporate it as well.  Appreciate all the info."
electronics,3cs10x,cypherpunks,2,Fri Jul 10 15:32:37 2015 UTC,"I used through hole resistors/caps because I thought they might have better power handling,   Well, they do, no question.  But what components need that ability?  Your switching transistors are already big parts for that reason.  But simple voltage dividers don't need to dissipate 1/4 W.   The power traces shouldn't have to handle more than 1.6A average, and when I plugged 2A into a calculator it said .02"" would be okay. Some of those traces are .04.   With the big TO-220 packages, I assumed higher currents.  Even so, 2A through 0.020""x1 oz copper gives 20°C temperature rise which is tolerable but definitely nothing to be proud of.  And that's just the trace, not counting all the nearby heat-generating components!  0.040"" gives 6.5°C (12°F) temperature rise, which is much better, but there's still nothing to lose and everything to gain from making big honking fat traces.  Also don't forget to consider ground routing!  Whenever you have a non-dedicated plane layer like your bottom layer, just being connected isn't enough; there's the risk that it will force ground currents (which are just as large and important as the corresponding signal currents!) to take labrynthine paths.  For example, consider the bottom-side trace from BATT pin 1 to U101 pin 13.  If you moved it down slightly, the ground fill could flow above it and connect some currently-isolated regions.  (Although in truth, you could move the entire trace to the top layer and not use the bottom at all.)  The bottom-side trace between C8 and D2 doesn't need to be there, and is blocking left-right current flow.  And the long bottom-side trace from the top-right of U1 (pin 16?) to D2 is also blocking a lot.  In addition to post-layout review, one way I address this are to manually route ground traces as a reminder to not break this path, even though it all gets covered with copper fill later.  Sometimes I end up adding some vias and top copper to connect ground on either side of a trace.  Oh!  One thing I forgot: although omitting them is helpful on high-current pins, thermal reliefs around pads and pins that don't need super-high currents make assembly a lot easier."
electronics,3cs10x,cypherpunks,3,Fri Jul 10 17:17:42 2015 UTC,"No mounting-holes - That is always an afterthought for me, and i can see no else mentioned it. It is always important to know how you want to encapsulate the board, and where the mounting-holes have to be. Moving traces and components afterwards is not time spend well."
electronics,3cs10x,cypherpunks,2,Fri Jul 10 20:50:17 2015 UTC,"(Arrgh, fates ate my last reply.  Sorry for the delay.)  Looking at the new SMT layout, the paired current sense lines are very nice.  However, several issues:   The main switching current loop from Q3 to Q1 to C2 and back to Q3 is still too large!  Why is it going through the PANEL connector's ground pin and under L1?  I don't know what chip U1 is and thus the switching frequency, and under 100 kHz you can get away with more, but you have Rset = 49.9K, which is 300 kHz.  At that speed, you really have to watch the layout. ** See the parts placement in the demonstration board at http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/demo-board-manual/dc1619af.pdf.  Note the proximity of Cin3, Cin4, Q1 and Q2. As I mentioned before, Q1 and Q3's gate drive lines are also very important, second only to the main power switching loop.  The current layout's long, high-inductance drive lines (Q1's gate drive has six vias!) will slow the switching speed, increasing losses in the transistors. ** Quoting the LT3845A data sheet for the BG and TG pins: ""Since very fast high currents are driven from this pin, connect it to the gate of the power MOSFET with a short and wide, typically 0.02"" width, PCB trace to minimize inductance."" Also, the gate drives have image currents underneath them; they should not cross ground splits. There's some bizarre criss-cross trace routing on the left side of C7 and the bottom of R2. If D101 is a MELF,consider a different package; MELFs are hard to pick and place because they can roll away. Should Q2 have more of its pins connected? Are you sure C1's package is large enough?  That looks pretty small for 47 uF at 44V. When connecting multiple pins together like U101 pins 5-6-7, it's nice to avoid connecting the pad sides directly like an H.  This tends to look like an erroneous solder bridge to an inspector.  It would suck of someone ""fixed"" it with a pick.  Connecting the ends with a trace slightly outside the row of pads, like an m, tends to work better. Likewise for U1 pins 4 and 5. The cross-under via near U1 pin 9 could be eliminated and the cross-over moved to one of the other two via pars on those traces. Rotating R4 and R109 by 180 degrees would clean up their traces."

Unfortunately due to time constraints I sent off a board I thought was 'good enough' today so hopefully it will still somewhat work with the convoluted gate drive path.  This is what I am having made, however I would still like to hear all the things that are wrong with it.  http://imgur.com/a/EFJ7I  What are the odds that it won't work at all?  edit: I thought L1 was part of the main current loop"
electronics,3cs10x,Geekv2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:51:38 2015 UTC,"I thought L1 was part of the main current loop   It's part of the main current path, but only at DC; you don't have rapidly changing currents through it.  (The whole point of an inductor is that it doesn't permit rapid current changes.)  It's the high dI/dt sections that are layout critical.   What are the odds that it won't work at all?   I'd need to do a complete component review to really answer that; the most likely source of problems is something other than the layout.  However, it's also true that switching converters, common as they are, are tricky and often don't work the first time around.  I'd guesstimate 2/3 chance it'll work, 1/3 it won't.  A lot of problems are reduced by dropping the switching frequency, but whether that's possible depends on the inductor."
electronics,3cs10x,mattmr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"Okay, looking at that layout in detail, I see   Problems fixable at rework:   R6 (part of feedback voltage divider) is not connected to SENSE_OUT_NEG.  This will be fatal until repaired with a jumper wire. Q2 and Q3 pins 2 and 3 not hooked up.  Not fixable but unlikely to be fatal:   No heat-sink copper for Q1, Q2, Q3.  They each want a significant area of exposed copper attached to their drains.  That should be about 0.5x0.5 inches, 4 times the size of the part itself.  See Fig. 6 on p. 3 of Siliconix AN81, available as p. 10 of http://www.vishay.com/docs/68807/si7135dp.pdf High-inductance ground connections for C4, C5, C6.  I don't think the LTC4000-1 PWMs the PMOS, so hopefully they don't have high currents, but there's no point connecting multiple capacitors in parallel directly to the power bus if the other end will be connected to ground with long skinny traces and a single shared via. I don't see the layout advice from the LTC4000-1 data sheet (p. 32) followed:   C101 and C104 are only moderately close The ground connections are not kelvined back to the BATT- connector Okay, the LTC4000-1 and LT3845A are fairly well separated.

Eventually you will need more but basic algebra is enough to start but trig, vectors, matrices and calc are necessary for a good understanding later on. A sprinkling of computer science,  logic and programming really opens up your future with microcontrollers. These are some basics before really jumping in on the electronics itself.   After you have some prereqs done, I would start looking at ohms law and getting comfortable with the units, the concepts,  and how they relate. There is some memorization like resistor values and stuff like that. Then I would start getting familiar with the types of basic components, schemetics symbols and safety. There are a million intros online this should be easy.   Now grab some simple practice circuits and build something. You will have to learn so prototyping skills like soldering and breadboards and such,  but there are a million videos on YouTube to show you that. From here you can get on simple courses and/or let your interest guide you. I can't stress enough though that a breadth of basic knowledge will pay off in the end.

What you need to know about RGB LED strips is that they're powered by 12V and use more current the longer the strip your powering. I metric I use is on the Adafruit website, here. So, if we need 60mA for each 3 inch segment and you want to power 50 feet (damn), then let's do the math.  50 feet is 50*12 = 600 inches  Our estimated current draw for each 3 inch section os 60mA, so 60mA/3inch or 20mA/inch is our scalar.   A rough estimate for the current you're dealing with is 12A (again, damn).  You should look in to using something like this. That little dude will give you all the power you could need. Really you probably only needed a 15A, but the only 15A with any reviews on Amazon was a Supernight brand and also cost 20 bucks, so I thought for 5 bucks more I'd probably just build it like a tank and have confidence in my power supply.

You'll work as some experienced tech's gopher for a while as you learn how to do stuff. There's a time/experience requirement to get a journeyman's certificate. Usually you are talking 2-3 years, depending on you, your mentor, and your field.  This will get you a basic working knowledge of the stuff you are wanting to learn. As you work, some companies will pay for further schooling. The company I am at will pay up to $5000 per year for professional development (college, certifications, licenses, etc).  If you are willing to begin at the bottom, apprenticeships are the way to go with the added benefit of getting paid.

Engineering is not what most other people think it is anymore. Gone are the days of putting on a lab coat, grabbing that soldering iron, mounting parts on a board, using the oscilloscope to test your outputs, signal integrity etc... Only a small portion of the engineering crowd get to do that on a regular basis. In this day and age, you spend much more time in the office writing and checking off requirements, preparing presentations, asking for more money and time, do reliability analysis and attending meetings. Most engineering jobs that are out there are require you to be in front of your computer typing away. Background in electronics only prepare you for a small portion of the job. They want to know if you know the theory, can coherently explain your design to stake holders, can handle long nights tracing requirements, can you document things properly, how do you handle deadlines and being overloaded etc.... Most of that gets checked off during the rigorous engineering training that is called the BSEE and MSEE."

electronics,3cp69a,PascLeRasc,2,Thu Jul 9 22:41:42 2015 UTC,This makes complete sense. I've always known if I want to make it in EE without a degree I better invent something. How do you feel about EET degrees?
electronics,3cp69a,Ron_Jeremy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:05:47 2015 UTC,"Well EET degrees are less common since it probably not much easier than getting a BSEE. However if you end up getting a 4 year BSEET, you can take the Fundamentals Engineering exam. 4 years later you can take the Professional Engineering exam. If you become a PE than the road to being an EE is fully open to you, but you could always just study EE in a state school for almost for free while working as a technican at a company and then get promoted to or find an EE job.   I recommend for you to get a technical certification avalible in your area, like soldering etc..... then get a technican job at a company that offers EE positions as well. While doing that, go to school and get your bachelors in EE. When you come out, you will have a BSEE and 4 years of work experience, you will be a much more likely candidate to get an engineering job than who is fresh out of school.  If you don't want to do any schooling, think it is not possible, or just plain think it is too hard, boring or time consuming, then don't bother trying to be an engineer anyways, you are gonna hate it.   All the fun is on the technician side, all the money and technical management career options are on the engineering side."

For say, if you are an industry expert at board testing and you know everything there is to know about it and want to work in a lab, your wish would be granted  4) Don't sweat it too much since even the most stubborn ( I wanna be in the lab, I don't like meetings and managing money and people!!!) type people secretly wish they made 150k+ with a big house and drove a porsche.

I will note that one of my heroes Jim Williams did not have a degree and worked his way up from being a tech.  That was a generation ago though and it's very very difficult to get your foot in the door without some piece of paper.  I'd say the best way for you to go is to showcase your projects via a blog and ""maker"" type forums. Some big things nowadays started off at the hobbiest project level. Occulus and quad copters come to mind. If you can get up to speed with what's hot now and demonstrate your chops, you might be able to swing an offer of employment via networking this way.

People who demonstrate skill in the field we're hiring for usually hit the ground running much easier than someone with education but no experience in a specific set of technologies we're using (we've hired university professors who've struggled).  Curious if similar holds true in EE. Wether someone with working experience with no degree is prefered over someone fresh out of college, like in software industry?"

I started electronics as a hobby 20 years ago when I was in highschool. After graduating I couldn't afford to get into engineering, but I spent all my free time designing. I ended up getting an electronics technician diploma at the local community college.  After graduating I went into a local manufacturer for an engineering position. He wasn't interested in hiring a non-engineer so I thanked him for his time and pulled out some of my designs and asked him what company he uses to make his proto boards. I left with a job.

Eventually these guys would be some sort of hybrid technician/consultant with the technical skills able to make stuff but with the keen insight necessary to work with the higher ups. These guys were on a mechanical branch but I know in the workshop we had several technicians working in the electronics - building prototypes for client presentations, reverse engineering products to break patents.  If that sounds interesting and you're in the UK, check out HNC's in electronic engineering.  I will say though if you choose the straight electronic degree path, having the hobbyist element on your CV makes a great impact since you have some technical skills already so you can start adding value. This tech consultancy I interned at were keen to hire specialists but would make allowances if the graduate had some solid experience - being a hobbyist was one example."

electronics,3crbsf,uint128_t,3,Fri Jul 10 05:50:27 2015 UTC,"I recommend you attempt to build active lowpass filters, since you're going to have opamps anyway to introduce the necessary offsets and scale factors.  It will give you great satisfaction to perform scaling, offset, and lowpass filtering all at the same time in a single opamp circuit.  Protip: you'll want to use ""Single Supply Opamps"" like the LM358/LM324 for this project -- or else you'll need to provide dual power supplies like +12V and -5V.  Why?  Because the input voltage from PWM goes all the way down to ground.  Standard, non-single-supply opamps (741 et al) shit the bed when their input pin voltages are at the bottom supply rail.  To use a 741 you will need a bottom supply rail voltage at least 3V below ground.  If your system already has this, great!  If not, consider the mighty LM358 and a single +12V supply.  {LM358 can only drive its output pin up to (+Vsupply - 2.5V) and you need Vout=7V}"

The input port on my hardware registers an Open Switch signal as 127 (the highest value possible), and a Closed signal as 00. These values are passed along to software (Midi Translator Pro).  This application allows me to take a 00 message and turn it into a full on/off message on a particular Midi CC. Then, a 127 message can be turned into a full on/off message on a different Midi CC.

I want to send the electrical signal “On"" ONLY from one switch (and with every press of the button), and the electrical “Off” ONLY from the other switch. Which is impossible, right?  If so I’m sorry for wasting your time.  EDIT: Unless...One dual button footswitch I have right now is a momentary switch with a TRS output. (One switch goes to Tip, the other to Ring.)

electronics,3cq0tf,whitcwa,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"I believe a simple and cheap solution to your problem is the use of an SCR, a silicon controlled rectifier. See the wikipedia. It's basically a diode that has a latching gate pin. So, the ""on"" button is normally open and connected from high to the gate. The ""off"" button is normally closed and connected from the cathode to a resistor to ground. The ""output"" of your circuit is the cathode of the SCR, on either side of the off button switch. If you press the on button, high voltage (5? if your operating voltage is higher than that, look at the datasheet for your SCR and use a voltage divider) goes to the gate and current conducts through to the cathode and across the resistor. The voltage of your output will then be high. Press it again and nothing happens, it's been latched in the on position (conducting mode). Press the off button and current will cease, allowing the SCR to return to non conducting mode. After releasing the off button, the output will be pulled to ground by the resistor."

Since i need 6 Switches for +12V, -12V, +5V, -5V, +3.3V, and +5V Standby (it's on even if the fan is off), i used a on-off-on switch.  if the switch is off, the 0.1A fuse is used, if you switch to the 1A fuse the 1A and 0.1A fuse is in parallel, it will properly trap a bit slower since a 1A fuse bit thats ok.  the right terminal goes to banana-plugs."

A friend of mine commutes long distance to work and co-rents a secondary apartment closer to his workplace. I was visiting him the other day and he went into a bedroom (not sure whose bedroom it is) and came out holding it and asking what it was. I took some pics and said I would find out. Since then he told me that it belongs to his female roommate who put it there because she is often alone and ""doesn't feel safe there"".  So, I guess the rationale is that she installs the device so she will know if someone breaks into the apartment?  I advised him to be careful about his roommate."

electronics,3cpj3n,krixen,3,Thu Jul 9 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"So, first things first, make sure that you're bringing chip select low before your SPI interaction to ensure that the IC you're working with knows you're trying to talk with it.  When you're done with the SPI communication, make sure you bring CS high again, because that may be necessary to cause data to be latched into the registers on the IC or the PIC.  Second... make sure that you're following the correct method of SPI signalling... there are four modes that determine on a clock pulse data is read and when data is latched.  Third... make sure you're assembling that first communication correctly.  You have it listed as ""register_address"", but in actuality it's a R/W bit, then a M/S bit, then six address bits.  Finally, yes, you have to drive the clock signal in order to read data back once you've told the chip you're intending to R+S=ADDR, and you drive the clock signal by telling your microcontroller to send out data of some sort. I typically create a constant called ""JUNK"" with a value of 0x00 just so I can easily see in my code when I'm using it.  Read more detail (plus scope captures) here...

electronics,3cpj3n,_dan_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:35:47 2015 UTC,"It's important to bring CS high again, both for your chip and just in general, in order to ""commit"" any changes to the chip on a write function.  The SPI registers in an integrated circuit are (gross simplification) basically shift registers... you shift data in and out of a buffer, but that buffer doesn't get committed to the actual register until the CS pin is brought to Vcc.  I'm hoping by ""I have brought /CS to gnd"" you don't mean, ""I designed a PCB and paid to have it fabricated that has the /CS pin connected directly to ground"" :)  In some cases, CS can be used to wake a chip up too, bringing it into a state where it draws higher current, in which case, leaving it with the CS low would be drawing unessential current from your power supply."
electronics,3cpj3n,_dan_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:58:56 2015 UTC,"The way to power the device is having a '1' in the MSB of the CTRL_REG_1, but I do know that typically if you only have one device it is okay to just keep /CS to ground.  I didn't specifically design this but I am programming/testing it. Do you think this could be a reason I am getting NOTHING when reading the registers?"
electronics,3cpj3n,_dan_,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:24:44 2015 UTC,"If you have to enable the device by writing a bit to CTRL_REG_1, but you never bring CS high, then that's a huge potential problem, because if CS stays low, it will never allow the bit to be latched into the register... ""committed"" to the register.  It will just sit there... and sit there... and sit there... and sit there, without CS going high.  Do you have an oscilloscope?  If you do, my method is usually to trigger on the CS low going signal and verify each of the other channels in turn (if you have a two channel scope) or all of them (if you have a four channels scope).  If you have at two channel, trigger on CS, then verify that you're actually seeing a clock signal.  If the clock signal is valid, then make sure you're seeing your outgoing values on MOSI.  If you're seeing the R/W + M/S + ADDR on MOSI, then check MISO.  I'm not familiar with the PIC library, but there should be some place in there where you specify the polarity and phase of the SPI bus, so make sure that matches what's in the datasheet.  I don't remember the specific mode values off hand, but the datasheet says it works with the falling edge of the clock.  Reading the datasheet, I would say your first interaction with the chip would be to SINGLE WRITE to the CTRL_REG_1 register.  All I think you'll need to do at first is set that PD bit, so you'd send...  1st Byte: 1010 0000 = 0xA0 2nd Byte: 1000 0000 = 0x80"

Electrical: Power - renewable energies and power stations looking at the electromechanical requirements needed to convert one type of energy into useful electrical energy, it sits at the in between of mechanics and electronics since you're still dealing with macro objects and how they interact in the physical world and the electrical energy they create.  Electronics still deal with electrical energy but the focus is more on how it can be used to convey and communicate information. Areas include digital and analogue communication - how devices can send information through varying mediums and the problems faced therein, microelectronics - looking at designing really small integrated circuits like that of your CPU that can process and store information. Microelectronics is a big area actually and also focuses on the design of components that fill the SIL black boxes you see on PCB's, these components can be for power circuits that deal with high powers or very sensitive electronic sensor circuits. The latter circuits that use those components would be designed by an electronic engineer whilst the former would more usually be an electrical engineer since each has more specific knowledge of the what they need each component to do... There are over a 1000 op amp components available for design some for big power circuits and some for sensor circuits. instrumentation which looks at how we measure and ""see"" the world around us and convert that information into electrical information an electronic circuit can use - i.e a microphone or light sensor."

We opened a position for a general electronics person for a small company; it was aimed at a graduate / hobbyist and is pretty much a copy of my current position as I was hitting 70+ hrs per week.  The idea was to get someone with an interest in electronics, and tailor the position to suit them and anything they did would take the strain off me.  This was a position I would have chopped my balls off to get a few years ago. Want to dick about at 3D modelling? Want to design test gear? Build it? Program it? Build equipment worth millions all on your own? You pretty much do whatever you think best benefits the company, and you get many, many toys to play with to do so.  The example I used was that I just bought a reptile nursery off ebay to mod into a temperature cycling chamber for some detectors. Stick a controller on it, bigger peltier, build a test rig for the detectors, sort out some logging and see if it works.  A good few days work, spurred from a hunch. If it works, you increased the quality of the end products, if not, not an issue and you have somewhere to warm sausage rolls or chill drinks until you find another use for it.   I wanted a young person ideally as it's a wide range of experience for someone to use as a stepping stone, or they can settle down and go for the long haul.  We advertised on all the big job sites and a couple of more tech focused ones. Holy shit the applicants...  Couldn't spell their home town, on a typed CV, and it's there in the auto-correct dictionary of the software they used.  Experience: Built a PC.  Experience: Six years of sending email from home.  Experience: Set up a wifi router for a restaurant.  I was hoping for a single person to apply who wasn't completely retarded, and actually had an interest in electronics as a hobby.  After two weeks of being bombarded with idiots, if one person applied that could tell me what an LM555 was, or what a 7805 regualtor did they would have got the job on the spot.  It's personal experience, but there are great jobs out there (I found some to 'borrow' job posting ideas from) but there are either very few applicants that are suitable, or good people are looking in different places.   We eventually found a near ideal candidate after just over a month, and offered the job two days after the interview. Not as much experience as I hoped, but learning super fast and seems to be having a lot of fun too.

A lesson you learn from careers seminars is to spread your bets and not put all your money on big hitters like Babcock (who incidentally aren't purely defence company, they have an enormous civil portfolio), you diversify your risk by applying for a spectrum of small-large. For example Babcock and Maersk would be large contractors, but then there are their supply chain companies which would be a big block of small-medium job hunting opportunities.   Even if you weren't planning on starting work this year it would have been smart to go through the application process anyway, as practice for when you really do need to begin work."

electronics,3cl8bw,shamgar_bn,4,Wed Jul 8 19:53:00 2015 UTC,"I was trying to solve this exact problem a while ago, and haven't yet implemented it. I can get you the circuit in a few hours.  From what I recall, the rotary dial has two 'clock' outputs that pulse out of sync as you rotate the dial. Call them A and B.  If A rises before B, then you're moving one way. If B rises before A, then you're moving the other.   I figured out a way....using flip flops I think....to have it pulse one of two outputs depending on which direction you spin the dial. Connecting each output to original volume buttons is then trivial.   Consider this comment a temporary placeholder and a reminder for me to grab that circuit design.   Edit - here's the circuit. http://imgur.com/1KJJmD8  It was designed for this switch: http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/TSWB3NCB222LFS/CKN10345-ND/2627684  On my diagram, ignore the third switch on the left. The top two switches represent the A and B rotary dial outputs. See page 4 of the data sheet for why it's drawn that way."
electronics,3cl8bw,neanderthalman,2,Wed Jul 8 21:18:18 2015 UTC,"Yes. Rotary encoder. Easiest to implement with simple microcontroller, but you could probably do it with some tricksy logic. Either way, added circuitry would need power to operate."
electronics,3cl8bw,MrSurly,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:08:16 2015 UTC,"So I looked that up, and saw that the rotary encoder spins without limit, defining that as the different from a ""potentiometer."" Now forgive my [VERY] limited knowledge, but I'd actually rather have a limited rotation. Would the potentiometer be the better choice? Also, how do I wire the knob in place of the buttons?"
electronics,3cl8bw,Flath,2,Wed Jul 8 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"In theory you could use a potentiometer, but it would require a lot more steps.  When you see a potentiometer controlling volume  like here it's telling the device ""set the volume to what I'm currently pointed at"", when you see buttons they're telling the device ""move the volume one click up/down from whatever the hell it currently is"" -  the buttons don't actually know or care what the current setting is.  Whatever you go for you've got to find a way of making your input device of choice pretend it's two buttons being pressed, and if it's a potentiometer that would mean comparing the current volume setting to the knob position and deciding if you need to go up or down and by how many clicks. Which means whatever alteration you make would have to include a device to keep track of that, and synchronise it if you turn it off and on.  A rotary encoder, as others have said, would get around a lot of these problems because it doesn't have to care what the current volume setting is. Picture it like a scroll wheel on a computer mouse (which is actually how they work), if you scroll to the bottom of the page you can keep moving the wheel, the page just doesn't go anywhere; or for that matter if you keep pressing volume down when you're already at minimum - so the fact that it's not physically limited isn't a problem.  If you use a rotary encoder it's still not as simple as removing the buttons and soldering a knob in place of them, you'll need a little bit of circuitry that detects what direction the encoder has moved in, and simulates pressing the volume up or down button as needed.  I've rambled on a bit there, but hopefully I've made things a bit clearer for you."

I've seen instances with industrial grade coils where insulation can melt and start arching at 255v so if you've build your circuit for 240v you might want to ensure your using something to insure you've got clean power.

Then piecemeal the components from eBay and AliExpress if you don't mind waiting a month... Generic AVR boards can be had for a fraction of the price as well, which are compatible with the arduino IDE.  I would familiarize yourself with the basic basics, no microcontroller (uC) - lighting an LED through a resistor that you calculated with Ohms law, playing with switches and buttons, figuring out a transistor.  Then apply those to a uC by detecting button and switch states in code (software) and doing things to a few LEDs like lighting it, blinking, fading, etc.  Even outside a uC, play with some 74/40 series logic ICs using just buttons and LEDs.  As a programmer you may find that extending code cause&effect to the physical realm is really just a tiny step.  You just may need to be aware of input&output voltage and current considerations where components and your uC may disagree on how to ""talk"" safely."

If you have the right tools, you can learn a lot more from playing around with arduinos and circuits because you can see what's really happening vs. what your spice software tells you should be happening. Also... pick up a copy of The Art of Electronics, 3rd edition, which was finally released this year."
electronics,3cgom6,TheJBW,4,Tue Jul 7 20:30:24 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. Although would definitely recommend picking up more than one multimeter. Because often times as you're tinkering you want to measure multiple points or multiple things, like current and voltage. Also he may want to double check his readings with multiple meters, in case something goes wrong with the meter.  The gear I would recommend to someone serious about getting into electronics would be (don't need all this to start with, but this is what I would get if I was starting again):    Multimeters: Fluke 87V is my personal favourite. I think it's the best multimeter Fluke makes. Fluke makes more advanced meters, but too many features impact battery life and ergonomics, which is not what I would want in a day to day meter. 87V has the perfect mix of quality, ergonomics, battery life, protection, easy UI imo. And it has all the essential features one would want in a day to day meter. And as a 2nd meter I would pick something cheaper. Perhaps a smaller Fluke or one of the other brands like: Agilent, Gossen, Brymen, Amprobe.. Fluke can be pricey but it's absolutely worth the money. However if the budget is tight, you could go with an Amprobe 510, and a Fluke 101 off ebay for under $100 (for both). Fluke non-contact voltage detector. These are cheap and can save your life. Scope: for the first scope it is impossible to beat the Rigol 1054z. There is no scope on the market that packs the performance and features this little scope does for $399. No brainer. Function generator: Siglent SDG 800 or 1000 series are excellent for the money. SDG 1025 if the budget permits. I give Siglent a slight edge over the Rigol in this department. Soldering station: He can get a genuine Hakko for just under $90. FX-888D although I liked the analog version better, the digital one is not bad. Hot Air rework station: don't see this one being suggested often in the guides, but the hot air rework station is probably my favourite pice of kit in my toolshed. It is just so damn useful. Soldering SMD parts, desoldering parts with lots of pins, heat shrink tubing, bending plastic.. Hot Air rework stations are amazing. I really like the Sparkfun branded one, just over $100, and it's of decent quality. Power supply. I really don't have a good answer to this one. The Rigol 832 is pretty good I hear. But I am a sucker for old power supplies. I have a few HP ones. The important thing is that they can current limit. Because often times this single feature is what saves your components if you're messing around. Standing illuminated magnifier. Also a jewelry magnifiers. Often times you will use it to inspect solder joints, or identify components. Thermal camera (optional): They are ""cheap"" now days. Flir just released their new Flir One, I've been liking it quite a bit. It can be great for detecting failure points.    And then bunch of smaller tools and supplies. Decent screwdrivers.. etc. Soldering paste, solder wire, flux, solder wick, solder vacuum pump, wrapping wire (useful for small pitch bodges and troubleshooting), single strand wire...  Anyways Dave covers it pretty well in his video. It's a bit outdated since it's a couple of years old now, since some of these newer instruments weren't on the market yet, but he covers all the bits: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_PbjbRaO2E"

I included some cheap options, if one goes with cheap options of what I listed.

For further cost cutting instead of a Siglent signal generator he can pickup one of those MH ones off eBay for $80. All the other stuff it makes little sense to skimp on.   Of course he can start without a sig gen, rework station, and buy gradually."
electronics,3cgom6,noiserr,3,Wed Jul 8 05:57:29 2015 UTC,"It's a good deal for what it is, but for someone JUST starting that's a huge investment. Better off starting with a handful of components and a cheapo multimeter and building from there."

electronics,3cgom6,dweeb_plus_plus,2,Wed Jul 8 10:35:43 2015 UTC,"I agree too, but I list all of this now so that it can actually save you money. For instance, I had bought a heat gun for shrink tubing only to later buy a hot air rework station. That's $50 wasted on the heat gun. Since the rework station can do the heat shrink tubing and bunch more.  When it comes to tools the old adage, if you buy cheap you buy twice is often true in electronics. A good DMM will last you decades, makes no sense to skimp on a good brand for something that doesn't get outdated and lasts a long time. When it comes to scopes, that Rigol is just soo good at that price point it's unreal, buying cheaper will actually cost you more money once you realise you could have had a sweet scope for $399.  Buy as you need it. Like don't buy a signal generator if you don't need one. And you will know when you will need one as you get into it.  I am not saying you should go out and buy all that stuff. Start with a multimeter, but it's just there so you can know what's available and what you can work towards.  Multimeter, a breadboard and a power supply is probably all you need to start, along with some components."

electronics,3cgom6,_imjosh,2,Wed Jul 8 15:10:37 2015 UTC,"a good deal of what I was doing was pretty well abstracted - and felt like I was skipping some of the base principles of electrical components   The Arduino abstracts away a lot of the basics as well. Although much less than a Pi. I'm not knocking it. Arduino's are great, but if your goal is understanding hardware at a root level you might just want to learn assembly on an AVR, PIC, or 8051. There's plenty of good resources out there if this is your bag."
electronics,3cgom6,classicsat,2,Tue Jul 7 23:02:43 2015 UTC,"Coming from the electrical side of things, I think it's extremely important to know some electronics basics in order to interface with a microcontroller properly and to get the most out of your inputs and outputs.  Everyone who wants to mess with electronics should have an intuitive understanding of Ohm's Law (V=I*R) and for that you're going to need a reliable voltage source and decently good multi-meter. You can purchase good bench supplies for not too much, or you can build your own out of a an old computer's ATX power supply with little to no electronics knowledge. After that you just need some resistors to begin understanding things like series/parallel circuits or voltage dividers. Maybe get some LEDS to use as indicators and to have your circuit ""do"" something.  The next thing I think is important to understand is transistors. You'll quickly find out that a microcontroller can only control tiny loads all by itself. It'll need some help to do things like turn on/off a motor or a bright DC light. The transistor is one device that can be the interface between a larger load and your microcontroller. In simple terms, a transistor is like a voltage-controlled switch. But of course they can be more complicated then that, they can also be used to amplify analog signals as one simple example. Learn a bit about output stages: your microcontroller will have a low power. You can augment this with different output stages of your own, each will have pros and cons and are good for different applications.  A logical next step from here will be to begin playing with op-amps and other ICs, but I'd encourage you to learn about capacitors first. For this it'd be a good idea to get a function generator and an oscilloscope so you can truly visualize the waveform and understand how a resisotor-capacitor (RC) circuit works. Learn about filters here: a simple circuit can be used to block high frequencis and only allow low frequencies through (low pass filter) such as the frequencies a subwoofer emits. Vice versa a high pass filter can block low frequencies and only allow high ones, like in a tweeter speaker. These are only two very simple examples.  Next you'll want to start playing with some ICs. A 741 op-amp can provide hours of entertainment. A 555 timer can provide hours more. You will definitely need an oscilloscope for this.  Somewhere along the line you'll want to experiment with miscellaneous things, such as relays or even voltage regulators. There are so many things to learn, and it's all fun and enlightening.  So, to answer your question, buying an Arduino (or any other microcontroller) will not lock you in to a product group. Resistors, capacitors, ICs etc are all standardized parts. All they're doing is influencing the ways electrons move through a wire. The electron won't care who made the devices on either end of the wire."

If it checks out as working under load for a long period (stress test it), hot snot, silicone and epoxy the shit out of it into the case. It won't be serviceable if it does break but plenty of the above should ensure that it doesn't break if it's thrown around or bashed.

electronics,3cglv7,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"For extra reliability, solder the jacks and pots to the PCB after they have been mounted into the chassis (or a suitable alignment fixture).

So I could put it into the computer via the microphone input jack.  Then a teeny piece of software measures the frequency of the input signal on the microphone, and converts that back to temperature.  Presto, 24 hour datalogging at 1 datapoint per 15 seconds.  edit- It was the company's computer, not mine, so I needed a way to get data into the machine without opening the case.  The microphone jack seemed like a harmless, IT-department-friendly, way to do this"
electronics,3cgreh,fatangaboo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:07:06 2015 UTC,"Nice idea.  In the olden days when computers used to have printer parallel ports I hacked a temperature doodad on a networked workstation with just a thermistor and a cap.  Charged and discharged the cap through the thermistor with data bit 0 and sensed the level on the cap with PAPER OUT.  The same could be done with a serial port's DTR and CD, I guess.  I epoxyed the thermistor and calibrated the doodad using a glass of icy water, a lightbulb, a chemistry thermometer and patience.  That doodad saved a lot of equipment from a few air conditioning equipment failures.  Edit an hour later: Just thought of something: Why not use a sound card's channel output through a thermistor and feed that to a 10K fixed resistor across the sound card's MIC input?  The two would form a variable voltage divider, like a pot, proportional to temperature.  The software would simply output a regular waveform and sample the microphone input at the same time and measure sound volume.  Should be precise enough with the sound card 16 bit ADC.  Would not need an external power supply."

electronics,3ccjod,bigshum,8,Mon Jul 6 21:44:56 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah I tried adding a description on imgur but I guess it doesn't show up, it just links to the image itself.  Alright, so there are two 1/4"" TS (mono) Jacks at the bottom in either side. One is an input and one is an output. This is for building guitar pedals, so my patch cables hook in to these. One my guitar plugs into the right side and one on the left goes to my amp.  On the top left, there is a TRS (Stereo) jack. I whipped up a cord with a TRS plug on one end and three alligator clips on the other - one for each conductor in the cable. One clip connects to the supply voltage (9v), one connects to the input signal, and one connects to ground.   There is also a blue wire, permenantly attached, coming out of the same side. This connects to the output jack when the DPDT toggle switch I added (can be seen about halfway down, on the left side) is flipped up. When it is flipped down, the output jack is grounded, stopping any sound from going out to the amp. The clip with the supply voltage is also disconnected from V+ when the switch is down.  Finally, I don't like batteries, so I installed a 9v DC jack in the bottom.  Edit: okay, heres the 'why' of the matter. Essentially, I was tired of needing to wire up two TS jacks and and a DC power jack to test pedal circuits. So I added all the features I needed to make this an audio probe as well as a multimeter."

electronics,3ccjod,PermanantFive,8,Wed Jul 8 16:47:43 2015 UTC,"Very cool, but be careful with your 9v adapter.  Most wall warts are actually pretty crappy power supplies and can introduce a lot of noise and possible ground loops to your circuit.  When measuring low level audio signals this can cause all sorts of hard to track down problems.  Bench top multi-meters have expensive isolation and filtering circuits in their internal power supplies to avoid these problems. Your multi-meter is designed to run off of a battery so it doesn't have any isolation and only  minimal filtering.  Batteries provide nice, clean, isolated DC power and for sensitive measurement applications are actually a better choice."
electronics,3ccjod,danosaur,3,Tue Jul 7 02:37:31 2015 UTC,"Came here to say this - batteries are a much preferrable source for power in terms of cleanliness and when accuracy in measurements is paramount to the task at hand. 90% of wall warts nowadays are switch-mode based adapters and this switching happens at very high frequencies which are libel to leak over into certain aspects of the electronics they're supplying power to (remember, every piece of metal in a system is a potential antenna//reception point for EMI), not to mention the standalone fact of shitty raw mains coming through it in the first place.      Case example - We use a bunch of handheld NTI mobile test rigs at work, 'XL2's' and Miniratorr-Pro's... they both come with mains adapters but we steer clear of them whenever we're taking measurements and use the batteries. Even though these units are designed and used to perform and calculate measurements to a Class-1 spec, they are not immune to the dramas involved with powering direct from mains voltages."

electronics,3ccjod,justfarmingdownvotes,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:54:55 2015 UTC,"If you ever have trouble with noise from a bad 9V DC supply you might be able to eliminate or drastically reduce it simply by soldering a film/foil, MKP, or ceramic decoupling cap across the 9V input jack. A common mode choke could also be desirable, depending on the circuit under test, however it will be far harder to squeeze it into the multimeter's case.  EDIT: Of course, a single electrolytic cap is perfect for low power DC stuff. If there are high current transients or bad ripple you should also add a low ESR and ESL capacitor in parallel with the electrolytic (very handy in DIY SMPS projects)."

It's kinda annoying that I'm trying to seek actual, legitimate help for this and people are downvoting the post, making it so less people can offer suggestions. I live in a small town with no makerspaces so I can't use their space. I had to rent out a small space in a school to run the program. I could have contacted one of the makerspaces in the closest large city but then I would need to rent a van or something to truck the kids there because most of these kids don't have parents with cars that drive. And then I'd need to find someone with a chauffeur's license to bus 8 kids to another city. Oh and I tried contracting with Uber, but they aren't able to do child only pickups and because it's a free (to them) program, their parents aren't willing to go with them and drop them off, then come back and pick them up via Uber.   I guess it's a good thing that I have a joy for working with kids because if I didn't, I'd be fucked. I don't have a space to establish a permanent lab, and I doubt many of the parents involved would be interested in dropping their 8-12 year old kids off at a 28 year old male's apartment to ""play with stuff"".

Instead I get a week and a half, and my friend is going through radiation therapy (and is a teacher, therefore he would have had free learning space even in the summer), but because I'm not a teacher, I have to pay to rent the facility.  So far, the only thing I've gotten was Intel to send 2 Galileo's (which I rather not have, due to C++ programming and the amount of time I have to teach) and Intel told me they are rolling out a Educational discount program any time soon, but they couldn't tell me if it'd be tomorrow or in a month.  This is a mess I've taken on, but I need to follow through with it due to the cost for renting the facility, which is non-refundable. I kinda jumped in feet first when offered the opportunity, not realizing that he had a very small amount of materials, certainly not enough for multiple kids to work with.

electronics,3cd1qa,uint128_t,2,Tue Jul 7 09:03:41 2015 UTC,So is it truly magnetostriction if it's a higher pitched random whine?
electronics,3cd1qa,TagSmile,3,Tue Jul 7 00:58:04 2015 UTC,"Well, there are many other sources of audible noise in a SMPS, and the transformer windings could also be badly potted. Chances are it's not random, per se, but a harmonic of the switching frequency (which may vary according the load and/or input)."
electronics,3cd1qa,toinaeraser,2,Tue Jul 7 01:05:32 2015 UTC,"I second the transformer windings.  Discontinuous mode will have a random noise sound (if so, it'll go away when you load it). In continuous mode, you have a single high frequency that changes duty cycle with load. In discontinuous, you can easily get down into the audible spectrum since the pulse spacing/frequency will depend on load. With no/light load, you end up with a very slow discharge of the output, so noise ends up being what triggers a pulse."
electronics,3cd1qa,TagSmile,2,Tue Jul 7 02:24:00 2015 UTC,"Yup! A modern switching power supply like that switches much faster than the line frequency. Also you might hear a lower or higher harmonic of the fundamental frequency.  Capacitors, particularly ceramic ones, suffer from this too, although that's from the piezoelectric effect."

You would start by knowing what supplies you need (12v, 5v, 3.3v, other weird ones) and then knowing what the max current draw on each will be. At this point you need to decide on a configuration and I doubt that a linear supply will work. You will likely need a half bridge switched mode power supply. These are not trivial and in order to design one you will need more than basic EE knowledge.  Can it be done? yes, but I don't think it's worth it if you actually want to play the thing.

electronics,3c9dx6,CakeLore,14,Mon Jul 6 02:58:28 2015 UTC,"This is an electronic ballast.   The large yellow thing is the output choke, and NOT a transformer, despite looking like one. It is a couple to a few mH.  It forms a resonant  series LC tank that builds voltage until the lamp ignites.  A the lamp shorts a parallel capacitor, lowering the resonant frequency and thus the voltage.  This tends to be just a few volts above mains for a CFL.    The black bobbin inductor is probably, as you suspected, a 10mH choke.  This serves as input filtering, and would be a common mode choke in a higher quality circuit.  The green toroid is wound as base drive transformer. Any given winding, despite being just a few turns, is probably in excess of a mH, up to a few mH. It's designed to limit current through the bulb by becoming saturated at that current which stops enough base current from getting to the transistors.  It has ridiculously high permeability (thus, saturates from hardly any current, even with just one turn) and is basically useless except as a low current pulse transformer or a common mode choke.       Really, the only way to identify inductors is actually measuring them.  Ready made inductors are hardly the rule.  The big yellow choke is custom made, and the base transformer is just a toroid core that they probably hand wound at the factory making those bulbs.  There is no datasheet or part number for either.  There is for the core definitely, but not a core arbitrarily wound for an application.       Fortunately, measuring inductance is extremely easy, a very good LC meter can be breadboarded easily and extremely accurate.  I really have no idea why it isn't a standard feature in more multimeters.  Simply create an LC oscillator using a known C and L, then put an unknown L in series with the L of the oscillator, and use a frequency counter to see what this unknown L has changed the oscillator's frequency to.  After that, its trivial to calculate the inductance of the unknown L under test.  This doubles as a C meter as well, only the unknown capacitor is put in parallel with the capacitor in the oscillator (the goal is to add inductance or capacitance to the incircuit capacitor or inductor in the oscillator).      Here is a great write up by Kerry Wong with a simple but very effective LC meter circuit. As you can see, it's trivial to construct one, much easier than you'd think:  http://www.kerrywong.com/2010/10/16/avr-lc-meter-with-frequency-measurement/"

electronics,3c9dx6,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:20:12 2015 UTC,"If there's only two pins then it can only have a single coil, so yes it is an inductor. We can't really see how thick the coil's wire is, so we can't make any guesses about the number of turns or inductance.  The green ferrite core could be easily rewound with the required number of turns, although those small cores are a nightmare if you need to wind 50+ turns by hand."

Having said that, your worst case scenario is permanently crippling the polyfuse on that usb port from shorting it out too much.. All you need to prevent that is judicious application of electrical tape.  USB ports are protected from overcurrent and short circuit, and the current limit is quite low. You won't get any fire out of that.  ps: a bit of heatshrink would be awesome to tidy it all up a bit if you fix the solder joints ;)"

Apply heat and rich the solder on, it shoul wet the wire but not glob, if it globs then flick the iron to remove excess solder and use it to wick off some of the solder  Once you have all the ends tinned apply a very small amount of solder to the iron (wet, not pooled). You should not need the solder again unless the iron starts discolouring, if so, wipe it off and reapply.   Hold one end in one hand and the iron in the other, touch both wires together so that the tinned ends completely overlap but don't overlap with the insulation   Touch the iron on the joint till the solder flows between the wires, remove iron and hold still, the metal will solidify.   Do this for each conductor.   You can make the joints less likely to touch by offsetting the joints, but my preferred method is shrink wrap round each wires and bigger wrap around the whole bundle."
electronics,3cae2n,Irrumatus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"You can make the joints less likely to touch by offsetting the joints   This also reduces the OD of your patch job, because you don't have all the shrink tube or vinyl tape in one spot."

electronics,3c86wr,Hasz,2,Mon Jul 6 10:20:34 2015 UTC,The ELI5 explanation: most of the capacitors (the round cylindrical things) are bulging (note how the tops are curved - they should be perfectly flat) and a couple are leaking (looks like bits of rust on the top). These are all failed components.   The capacitors filter the current from the supply to the motherboard keeping it clean and stable so they are critical for things running smoothly.   The reason is that the manufacturer cheaped out saving a few cents by buying cheap Chinese capacitors instead of higher quality ones that would last.

And I'm really glad to see more awareness of the FX2 and its uses.  It's worth noting that boards that are functionally the same as these are sold on eBay and aliexpress under the title ""24MHz Logic Analyzer"" and are available for $10 - sometimes less. These devices are sold as Saleae product clones - so it's quite unethical to use them with the Saleae software, but if you run sigrok+PulseView you're running a completely different, free/open source software stack, so there is no ethical issue."
electronics,3c688h,blindcomet,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:15:47 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for your work! Yeah, the clones that just replicate the VID:PID bug me...Saleae has put a lot of work into their products and they've got good gear with good software.

electronics,3c688h,blindcomet,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:41:05 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've got a question you might be able to answer. I'm only using 8 of the 16 I/O channels, pulseview polls all 16 though. Is there a way to configure it to only poll 8 (save on USB bandwidth and processing)? And if I add an 8-bit parallel output ADC to the second 8 channels in the future, is there a way to set those up as a single analog input?"
electronics,3c688h,blindcomet,2,Sun Jul 5 16:44:16 2015 UTC,So the fx2lafw driver/firmware supports a whole bunch of devices that have a broadly similar architecture. The only way we can handle the variations between their capabilities is to look them up in a table indexed by the USB PID/VID. In the case of the LCSoft Board this comes up with the default Cypress ID and we say these boards can support wide busses. So a reasonable work-about is to change your board's PID:VID to that of a product that better matches the capabilities your board has I.e. the Saleae Ids

electronics,3c4i9f,siliconcoder,5,Sat Jul 4 22:32:38 2015 UTC,My email is on my github site. I'm sort of a reclusive. If you have any ideas I would be willing to discuss them.   I was thinking about open source the other day and I came to the conclusion that there are  a lot of developers but they are not being directed. I mean there are great developers but the big projects come from many developers working on a single project. If git hub had something like a help wanted section for open source.  So that's my unrelated rant. If you need help with a programming task let me know and I will decide if I can do it or not and get back with you.
electronics,3c4i9f,Isaac_256,6,Sat Jul 4 22:46:42 2015 UTC,"OK, sent you a message.  In regards to open source, most projects, even large popular ones, are just a single developer.  See ""When Free Software Isn't Better"" - Benjamin Mako Hill.  Making it FOSS leverages community help for a project if it reaches a critical mass but most projects, even successful ones, don't reach that point.  On the one hand, it's a benefit because people can experiment and that experimentation is out in the open so that others can pick up and use the same ideas.  On the other, it'd be better to try and  direct all that intellectual capital to something more useful but that's easier said than done and sometimes goes in direct opposition to the nature of a lot of open source projects (i.e. they're being done as a hobby or side project).  There are a few sites that offer either 'help wanted' sections or even bounties for development.  For example, see the GNU: projects needing help page, Bountysource and Gratipay (technically not what was asked for but similar enough to mention).  Sourceforge and GitHub both have some facility for project owners to mark bugs or features as 'help wanted' as well.  My feeling is that the open source community is so rich (technology wise) precisely because people can play around without much fear of it being useful.  In MeowCADs case, because there are so many great projects and libraries that are FOSS, I could just incorporate them in without having to rewrite it.  Leveraging the FOSS community made MeowCAD possible and made my productivity orders of magnitude higher than without it.  Need a geometry library that can do boolean operations?  clipperlib.  Need a library of components and parts?  KiCAD.  Need a nice front end for the website?  Bootstrap.  etc. etc.  I had to write a lot, to be sure, but without those other components it would have taken so much longer.  Also remember that a lot of open source projects aren't trying to solve a business problem."

electronics,3c4i9f,Isaac_256,10,Sat Jul 4 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"Short answer: I like cats and ""MeowCAD"" sounds like ""MeowCat"".  Long answer: I really hated all of the hyper macho names (""Eagle"", ""Altium"", etc.).  They sound like something that should conquer bronze age Europe instead of something that's used to design circuit boards.  I wanted to make it accessible to people who might be intimidated by circuit design so I gravitated towards something 'cute'.  It might be too whimsical or sound unprofessional to some, and that's alright, but  I would rather err on the side of keeping it light than have a name that sounds like yet another energy drink."

Is that what you mean by netlist export?  In browser simulation (in some capacity) is not impossible but requires work.  My opinion is that it's one of those features that people always say they want but never actually use.  If people really want it, I'll implement it, but my feeling is that just being able to make schematics, boards and export to Gerber is going to cover 90%+ use case."

electronics,3c4i9f,dimitrifromparis,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:19:45 2015 UTC,"Competition is fantastic, thank you for putting in so much effort. Kicad seems to be the major FOSS PCB/Schematic CAD out there, but it's looks are like from the early 90's, and the workflow in my opinion is terrible, especially compared to software like Altium.  Kicad is getting work done by CERN people, which is fantastic, specifically auto router improvements such as push and shove. But, it seems no effort is being put into improving the workflow and GUI, much to my dismay. It seems that, while the electronics landscape is slowly evolving (mbed, platformio, Energia, VisualGDB, Upverter), it is met with significant resistance to change, with PCB software seeming to be the slowest to gain a following.  Why originally did you decide to go the route of making your own from scratch instead of either collaborating on Kicad with others or even forking kicad and improving it in terms of learning curve and whatnot?"
electronics,3c4i9f,jerzmacow,6,Sat Jul 4 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"OK, this is going to be a long answer, so sorry.  There are three main reasons why:   KiCAD is great but hard to install KiCAD is a local application whereas there's potentially a market for online EDA There were no good online free and open source EDAs available.   KiCAD is awesome.  I hope that MeowCAD will complement KiCAD and not necessarily be competition.  I'm really looking forward to better autorouting and especially the push and shove router, which looks awesome.  I'm glad that KiCAD is getting a lot of love, both in terms of community support and work done on it through CERN.  In my opinion, the biggest problem KiCAD poses from a hobbyist perspective is installation and UI.  I think it may have gotten better (I haven't checked in a while) but at one point compiling from source to get the newest version of KiCAD required you to have a bazaar login.  Compilation even if you had a login is another hurdle.  Making sure your projects update correctly, weird UI interfaces and graphical glitches all didn't inspire confidence.  I don't mean to bag on KiCAD.  Seriously, I <3 KiCAD but it's pretty clunky to use.  I looked into trying to fix what I thought were some pretty major UI issues but it was clear that it was going to be a lot of work.  Technically it could probably have been done and I might have even been down for it but I knew I would also be fighting the momentum of the other developers and trying to work against workflows that they've gotten used to that aren't very friendly to new developers.  For example, moving to GitHub shouldn't have been a big deal but it was met with a lot of resistance.  That's totally their prerogative.  They're the ones doing the work, they should decide what's best for them but at the same time, it's not very inviting to new developers.  MeowCAD has no installation requirement other than using a compatible browser.  MeowCAD works on Mac, Windows or Linux.  You can use MeowCAD from anywhere you have an internet connection and a compatible browser.  You can share snapshots of your project instantaneously.  You can click a button and get a Gerber output nearly instantaneously.  EDAs are hard no matter what.  I wanted MeowCAD to at least try and push the barrier to entry down a little bit.  MeowCAD couldn't have been developed without KiCAD.  Under the hood, MeowCAD uses all of the KiCAD libraries.  I used the Hershey font pulled from KiCAD.  Without KiCADs libraries, MeowCAD wouldn't have been possible.  There are various points in the pipeline (for export, etc.) where I use a KiCAD file format for intermediate representation.  That wouldn't have been possible without documenting their file formats and forging the way in the first place.  So while MeowCAD was built 'from scratch' it also relies very heavily on a mountain of FOSS software before it, including KiCAD.  If MeowCAD catches on, one by-product is that KiCAD will have a whole new set of schematics, boards and libraries to draw from because there will be a community of electronics designers funneling new content into MeowCAD which can be exported to KiCAD.  I really hope MeowCAD and KiCAD can complement each other.  I am worried that no one will really care that there's ""yet another online EDA"" or that the market is too niche.  What I find really concerning is the proliferation of these closed source online EDAs.  If even some portion of the electronics design community eventually do gravitate towards a web based solution, it would be a very bad position to be in if we were reliant on a closed source provider.  SaaS companies die every day.  Worse, if they're successful, the closed source companies try for an effective monopoly.  I wanted there to at least be a free and open source alternative, so I created MeowCAD."

electronics,3c4umk,TomBatesy,3,Sat Jul 4 20:48:55 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your design requirements; if it just needs to work quickly, your Atmega wired to an LED with a quick bit of code is perfect. If you're trying to make it small, you can use SMDs, which are surface mount components (a quick google will give you some examples), you can also do things like use an ATTiny85 which has a smaller pin out (and fewer features) than say an ATMega328 (the IC in an Arduino Uno). Alternatively, you can design your circuit without a microcontroller, and use say a capacitor, resistor, and transistor combination to make an LED blinking circuit.   As for the PCBs, you can design a PCB and have it made somewhere like OSH Park, but it isn't nearly as cheap as using a breadboard or veroboard/stripboard for small one-off's. You'd need a good reason to use it rather than just the veroboard you were prototyping on to justify the cost."

Get an order and then you fulfill them. You can also go the kickstarter/indegogo route in this day and age. You need to design an enclosure (weatherproof in your case, can survive vibrations etc...) and packaging (be a minimalist), some marketing etc... you don't think it but a lot goes into a product.  I am not as well versed in electronics as I am business but as someone said a PCB is a PCB. PCBs taking up a lot of space I think can be shrunk with respect due to components or area. For components it takes some ingenuity but area wise perhaps consider multiple circuit boards, double sided, packing things closer etc...

Not to downplay this meter as it is a remarkable achievement at this price point. Just saying that it isn't without its reasons."

electronics,3bxuq8,PedroDaGr8,8,Fri Jul 3 04:14:03 2015 UTC,"I know, I followed that thread very closely. My point was to emphasize that by cutting the current measurment, they both freed up board space and cut one of the most expensive protection components (the HRC/HBC fuse). Both of these together would make it significantly easier to design to the quality that this meter brought especially at this price point. More space means easier routing of traces and cutting the fuse frees up BOM money to upgrade other protection components to higher quality.   At this price point, compromises have to be made. Fluke's compromise was to cut the current function and clearly from a safety and durability perspective this was a prudent choice. Other meters with a lesser name might not have that option because people seeing the lack of current measurement ability might just walk on by.  As I said, this isn't to dump on the Fluke, because this meter is a damn good meter. Just explaining how they were able to do what they did and why possibly some other meters couldn't."
electronics,3bxuq8,PedroDaGr8,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:40:38 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with the the point you're making however the meter is also significantly smaller so the room benefit may not be there.
electronics,3bxuq8,PedroDaGr8,2,Fri Jul 3 04:47:27 2015 UTC,"The BOM costs alone are a huge advantage. The HBC fuse is often the second or third most expensive thing on the board (usually the multimeter IC or microcotroller+ADC are the most expensive things on the board). This is money that can be directed into upgraded MOVs, PTCs, diodes, etc. while still maintaining the desired profit margin.  As for board space, even with it being a smaller meter, there is a huge advantage. First, there are fewer traces to route to the main IC. These traces have to both be kept away from each other and still be in the same area. Fewer traces means it is easier to keep them farther away. More importantly, the HBC fuse is typically the largest thing on the board, followed by the 10A current shunt. When you consider that traces which carry the current have to be much wider AND two of the largest items on the board are now gone. This is a HUGE savings in space that even a dramatic reduction in meter size isn't going to use all of.   The fact is, for meters you can choose two (safety, features, price). They went with extreme safety, while cutting features. It clearly worked and they did a damn good job at what they did.  As an aside, the Amprobe AM-510 for me was almost as surprising as the Fluke. It wasn't quite as safe as the Fluke but it still is DAMN safe and has a good amount of features. I think for most people, the Amprobe would be a great first meter/only meter. Truthfully, between it and the Fluke you have some great choices depending on usage needs."
electronics,3bxuq8,Chuckgofer,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah the HRC fuses are expensive especially if you provide two ranges like most meters. In that thread though someone found an internal video or a document from Fluke in which they mention testing all their meters against a 17kv transient. So I don't think it's the case of 101 getting lucky due to lack of features if that's what you're implying.  I have bought and restored quite a few Fluke meters and the construction is always top notch. I agree about the Amprobe 510, I would recommend it for people getting into electronics."

electronics,3bxuq8,dokid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:30:42 2015 UTC,Lets say I don't know electricity from a hole in the wall (heh heh heh).    What's the current function?
electronics,3bxuq8,PedroDaGr8,5,Fri Jul 3 13:34:19 2015 UTC,"Current is the measurement of how much electricity is flowing through a circuit. It is measured in amps (A), common ranges are A, mA and uA. To use the water analogy, if voltage is water pressure; current is the flow rate in gallons per minute or liters per minute (depending on which part of the world you are from).   Current is measured by connecting your meter in series with the circuit under test. Then running the electricity through your meter to the circuit. The electricity flows through a low value resistor called a current shunt and meter measures the voltage drop across the shunt. Ohms law then gives you the current across the shunt, and as a result your circuit. You need these resistances to be as small as possible so that the voltage drop in your meter is minimal but large enough to generate a voltage you can read  Most meters have a shunt of around 10-30milliohms for the 10A range. Short circuiting even low voltages across a resistor of this low value can result in incredibly high current rates (thousands of Amps is possible). Usually only limited by the device supplying the current, but hundreds of amps is still routinely possible even from something as simple as a car battery.   Because, hundreds/thousands of amps are possible, inductive voltage rise can be a real problem in fuses. When the fuse blows, the innate inductance in circuit (from wires, traces, transformers, motors, actual inductors, etc.) tries to maintain the large current, as inductors do. As the circuit breaks, the voltage starts rising very rapidly in an attempt to maintain this current over a breaking connection. In a simple glass fuse, this voltage rise can actually reach a point where the voltage arcs over inside the fuse (a blown fuse fills the chamber with vaporized metal a great conductor). An arc, once established, is really easy to maintain (most arc discharge lamps will establish the arc with 10's of kV but the running voltage once warm is something like 40-80V). Meaning that you basically have a direct short circuit in your meter, a VERY bad thing. Something has to give and usually it is the glass fuse exploding. Sometimes though, it can still keep going and blow up other parts as well. This is the reason that High Rupture Current (HRC) fuses, also called High Breakage Current (HBC) fuses, are necessary. They are a special type of sand filled fuse which is capable of resisting this arc over and as a result are rated for 10's of thousands of A of breaking current. This high rupture current ability also makes these fuses VERY expensive. In most meters, it wouldn't surprise me if the HRC fuse was the second most expensive thing on the board (after the multimeter IC)."
electronics,3bxuq8,dokid,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:26:00 2015 UTC,"awesome reply, thanks!  can you expand on this part though:   Because, hundreds/thousands of amps are possible, inductive voltage rise can be a real problem in fuses. When the fuse blows, the innate inductance in circuit (from wires, traces, transformers, motors, actual inductors, etc.) tries to maintain the large current, as inductors do.     the high current energizes parts around the conductor and ""jumps"" across the blown fuse?"
electronics,3bxuq8,Capn_Crusty,2,Fri Jul 3 21:19:12 2015 UTC,"This is a difficult one to explain and truth be told, I don't entirely understand the physics behind it. I am sure someone can do this better than me (if you can pls do and pls correct anything that I get wrong). Too understand this, you have to understand how inductors work. In its most basic concept, inductors are resistant to change of current flowing through them. So if there is 1mA of current flowing through an inductor it will resist changes in that current by either dropping the voltage or raising the voltage via storing or releasing energy in its magnetic field. This is the inverse of a capacitor which tries to regulate voltage by modifying the amount of current flowing in and out of the capacitor (though i na capacitor the energy is stored as charge between two plates). As an aside, in an ideal device the amount of energy that can be stored would be infinite, in reality it is not. This, combined with other things like DC resistance, means that you will see some variation of the current in a real world inductor (just as you see some variation in voltage in capacitor smoothed ripple). For our intents and purposes though the ideal model will suffice for most of the discussion.  The thing to note is that not only inductors have inductance. Transformers are basically two huge inductors on one body (this is a gross simplification but for this discussion only it works). Similarly, motors often behave as large inductors as well. Inductors are not only limited to things that are comprised of metal and wire. Leads and traces also have small amounts of inductance. At high currents, these small amounts of inductance can actually have appreciable affects.   So where does that leave us. In this case, we will consider a low to medium voltage but ultra high current situation because high voltage situations will happen similarly but with even faster results. We have to look at this on the ultrafast time scale, microseconds or faster. Right before the fuse blows, it has hundreds or thousands of amps flowing through it. This current is backed up by inductances from the various sources previously discussed.  As the fuse beings to blow, the resistance starts to go up: as the wire is partly broken the resistance is going up, which means the voltage has to go up to compensate. This continues to happen until one of three things 1) the energy in the circuit is exhausted and the fuse blows without issue 2)the remaining energy is not unable to reach a high enough voltage before the fuse blows and the fuse blows easily, the remaining energy is released in an slight electromagnetic pulse or 3) the voltage reaches a high enough point to arc across the two sides of the fuse.   The higher the voltage and/or the current and/or inductance the more energy is stored. The more energy that is stored, the more likely it becomes that situation three is possible. The two ways you can fight this in a device are to limit the amount of inductance or to make it harder and harder for the arc to establish. In a multimeter, you don't have the option of limiting the inductances of the devices being tested. So you are left with trying to prevent the arc from forming. This is the role of the HRC fuse, it is a sand filled fuse which disrupts arc formation and makes situation 3 much less likely."

I have run two VC99 meters at 2000 volts continuously. however one of them i had siliconed over the fuse, voltage dividers and current sense resistors.  at that voltage the 10Mohm resistor is dumping well above its 1/4th watt limit.  a sand filled fuse, once its blown, should be able to hold up to 12kv. but at that point we'd be testing a fuse, not the meter."

It's definitely not something you would come across daily, if you're working with low voltage electronics then chances are even slimmer and I agree unlikely.

But my supervisor likes to micromanage,  and he insisted that I wrap the wire around each terminal in addition to feeding through the hole. Consequently I had to use thinner wire, so that I could acutely bend the wire without placing too much sideways force on the terminal.  The maximum continuous current is only going to be 2A anyway. I designed it to have an overkill power rating, so that the resistance value would negligibly change due to warming of the elements throughout each test. Then despite already being overkill, another supervisor insisted that I add 4 more resistors. (Not because of power concerns, but because he wanted a lower resistance value.)"
electronics,3bv1t5,CarbonGod,2,Fri Jul 3 02:27:23 2015 UTC,"This shunt has resistors capable of dissipating a total of 300 watts. It appears to be bolted through to the bottom of a steel or aluminum box.  If you intend to use this at a duty cycle higher than about 10%, I don't think you have adequate heat sinking.  These aren't vishay, but similarly constructed. The vishay datasheet for this class of resistors says this:   Vishay RE resistor wattage ratings are based on mounting to the following heat sink: RE70 and RE75: 5"" x 7"" x 2"" x 0.040"" thick aluminum chassis RE77 and RE80: 7"" x 9"" x 2"" x 0.060"" thick aluminum chassis (RE70 is a 20W resistor, RE77 is 30W)   So each resistor, in order to achieve its full power rating, needs between 118 and 176 square inches of metal to dissipate into.  The box bottom appears to be 6"" x 6"", with 2"" high sides. I assume there will also be a top installed. So total surface area is about 2(6 x 6) + 4(6x2) = 120 sq. inches. Now your metal is clearly thicker than 0.060"", but I do not think it looks like it can take 8x the heat.  300 watts of heat is the amount of energy it takes to raise a mug of water from room temperature to boiling in about 10 minutes. Now you probably weren't intending to use this as an immersion heater, so the heat transfer will not be quite that efficient as it's likely quite a bit of that will be trying to gasify the wood desk it's sitting on, or at least wood burn in a nifty clock face scar."
electronics,3bv1t5,Fencepost,2,Fri Jul 3 03:55:28 2015 UTC,"There are a lot of naysayers criticising the inadequacies of my design. So I'll justify it with some numbers.  The shunt has to cope with a steady state current of at most 2A. The highest transient current it has to deal with is about 4.5A for a few milliseconds. In terms of power, it's definitely good enough.  P = I2 R = 22 * (2/3) = 2.6W demand, to be soaked up by 12 resistors which each are rated for 25W. It's deliberately overkill.  It's overkill not so that it doesn't break from high current, but so that it heats minimally throughout a several second test, thereby keeping the resistance value very constant. Furthermore, I chose to have many resistors so that there's a high thermal inertia, to keep the resistance value constant. I was only going to have 8 resistors, but my manager insisted on 12.  I wanted to use the thickest wire which fits through the holes in the resistor terminals. But my supervisor likes to micromanage, and he insisted that I wrap the wire around each terminal in addition to feeding through the hole. Consequently I had to use thinner wire, so that I could acutely bend the wire without placing too much sideways force on the terminal.  As for the low inductance bit: we normally measure at 250kS/s. I haven't yet measured the inductance or frequency response of the shunts. I was going to just arrange the resistors in a 2 by 6 grid. But then I thought `why not do the circle thing?' The circle design is just an afterthought."

electronics,3by680,sun95,4,Fri Jul 3 03:15:13 2015 UTC,"My guess is whenever you move one servo, the increased current draw is dipping the supply.  This is causing the other pots to report a different voltage.  9V batteries have a quite high output impedance.  You should run the pots off the same 5V regulator as the Arduino.  You can also try a beefier battery or smaller servos."
electronics,3by680,tharold,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:57:16 2015 UTC,This would be my first guess as well.  I would add decoupling capacitors on each servo in addition to using a lower-impedance power supply.

It is however bad practice to have any delays in your main loop though so I would certainly remove that. twitching like you describe may simply due to the fact that you josttle the connections when you move a pot so for a moment you drastically change the Pot's value making the servo twitch.
electronics,3by680,scubascratch,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:25:30 2015 UTC,"Let's see the sketch. Maybe you are resetting the PWM timers on the non-changing axis. How are you deciding which axis to change, do you always set every axis after every pot read, changed value or not?  The pots should absolutely not have their high side at 9v. Thus means the pot when turned to that stop, will send 9v into the atmega analog input pin. This pin is only rated for about 5.5 volts, so 9 is way too much. Your pots need to have the high side at either 5v or 3.3, which is safe and regulated. 3.3 will probably be most stable."

electronics,3bt9jt,Seventytvvo,2,Thu Jul 2 02:27:31 2015 UTC,"GNUCap? You can give it a try, but LTSpice is way better.   LTSpice was also developed with Linux in mind. Not that it run natively, but it supposedly recognises that it's running on wine, and does some things differently to not break. It installs and runs perfect."
electronics,3bt9jt,one_up_hitler,2,Thu Jul 2 10:00:19 2015 UTC,"LT-Spice has been heavily optimized for speed and is often a full order of magnitude faster than the SPICE simulators it was based upon.

electronics,3bt9jt,Seventytvvo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"From what I can figure, they have spent millions of dollars on the development, and they can justify that, since it's part of their plan to sell a billion dollars worth of parts every year. Anybody else with those resources is going to want something in return for such a product.  Open source projects like Linux are also impressive, but those have a really wide user base, so it's practical to get thousands of people in on the development.

It is all based around one hand on the keyboard (for single-key shortcuts) and the mouse strictly for cursor motion.  Once you do this it is amazingly effective.  Of course, it is still absolutely maddening if you regularly switch between two programs which use different hotkeys (like LT-Spice and Eagle) or if you take a break or a few months an need to re-learn the hotkeys.  I'll also point out that I am one of those GUI nuts who believes that all applications should look and act the same but I have to admit that most CAD software written to these GUI design specs tend to fail hard when it comes to intensive usability.  This is why many of those ""ancient"" GUI's have not been ""updated."""

I certainly agree that using a modern GUI does not preclude implementation of a ""power user"" interface, but in practice the power user interface is non-existent.  I have not used Altium but I believe it implements an internal scripting and keybinding model so this leads me to believe it is one of the exceptions.  Of course, this feature does come with a rather severe price tag."
electronics,3bt9jt,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:33:30 2015 UTC,"I understand your point about breaking the interface for the existing userbase.  That's always a hard decision for a developer - but there are times when it's worth it, and I believe they qualify.  Nowadays, Altium runs for about $9k.  Of course, my understanding is that Cadence and Mentor Graphics can run over $20k, and Altium is better than both of them.  So in light of that, it's not nearly as bad.  Besides, as others have stated, Eagle is effectively MS Paint with a Gerber generator.  At least as of the last version I used, you can't even see a list of nets without writing a custom script.  <shudder>  If you're working on a complex, multilayer board, the difference in man hours can easily pay for Altium for a single respin."
electronics,3bt9jt,Capaenni,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:10:16 2015 UTC,"Now you are changing the discussion from one of GUI design to one of selecting the proper tool for the job. ;-)  For the circuits that you can put on an 80x100mm 2-layer board Eagle is a very reasonable solution, and it is very difficult to beat the price.  If that is all you need, it is worthwhile to embrace the interface.  As an aside, I have read of numerous complaints of both Cadence and Mentor which require an insane amount of menu-diving in order to accomplish common tasks which apparently cannot be scripted."
electronics,3bt9jt,FullFrontalNoodly,0,Thu Jul 2 12:33:57 2015 UTC,"Besides, as others have stated, Eagle is effectively MS Paint with a Gerber generator.  That's not even remotely fair.  At least as of the last version I used, you can't even see a list of nets without writing a custom script. <shudder>  Tools->Statistics->Class in the schematic editor gives you a netlist.  (I'm running the 7.3.1 beta, not sure when they added it.)  If you're working on a complex, multilayer board, the difference in man hours can easily pay for Altium for a single respin.  My personal record in EAGLE is 6 layers, 16 schematic pages, 1200 SMT placements, done in 2 man months.  Admittedly, the board editor was getting pretty damn sluggish towards the end.  I don't recommend that people build huge projects in EAGLE, but it is certainly a professional-strength tool that's capable of doing the job."
electronics,3bt9jt,NoahFect,2,Thu Jul 2 20:26:13 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying that people don't pull it off.  But it's extraordinarily awkward and so many tasks that should have direct support in a layout program requires workarounds, hacks, or custom scripts in Eagle, if it can be done at all.  From my experience, the MS Paint analogy seems to be dead on.  Drawing circuits in Eagle is one thing.  Error checking, tracing, and modifying that circuit is another thing entirely.    Even something as simple as moving a drawn object is something that you have to fight with Eagle to get it to do.  Some tasks require using the command line because there's no menu/UI support for it.  There's no built-in method to align/distribute parts.    And from what I recall, you can only group-select objects via a dragged window.  At least for slightly earlier versions, there was no support for Ctrl+clicking/Shift+clicking to add to a selection.  In a complex, densely packed circuit, that makes it a nightmare to properly select items.  Error messages can also be completely incorrect.  (Example:  Open a PCB file.  Add a via from the Draw menu and use the Name tool to change the net to something that already exists (such as GND).  Now try to delete the via.  Maybe the most recent versions have fixed this, but for most of Eagle's history, this would generate an error that would lead a user down the wrong path.)  And at least for the last version I worked with, the libraries were defined such that schematics are forced to be drawn on a grid of 0.1 inches in order to be compatible.  Now, forced to deal with all of these issues, can you still learn to workaround them and spit out a board?  Sure - but you shouldn't be forced to fight your tools the entire way.    I don't consider it a professional grade tool in the least.  And while I know that it has its supporters, I'm not sure I've ever encountered a person who had a working knowledge of Altium who still felt that Eagle was suitable for professional work."

electronics,3bqvkk,thoquz,8,Thu Jul 2 23:17:06 2015 UTC,"Spread some sulfur (ebay) over a piece of clean copper-clad board, leaving some copper uncovered. Heat this on a hotplate, ~120C, in a fume hood. Try to keep the sulfur from catching on fire or running into the uncovered section. This will produce toxic fumes. When the copper turns black, soak up the extra sulfur with a paper towel. Clean the unsulfured portion of the board and solder a wire there. Then get some thick aluminum wire. Cut the aluminum wire into a tiny piece--as long as it is wide. The idea is to get a particle with sharp edges. Then get another clean copper-clad board, solder a wire to it, and bolt it over top so as to compress the aluminum wire into the other board. Not too tight. Make it just tight enough to keep the aluminium from falling out. You may have to add a solder dab to the clean copper board in order to create a raised platform so as to give the aluminum more to press on. You'll have a copper clad - copper(i) sulfide - alumiunum- copper clad sandwich. Your two memristor leads come from the copper clad boards.  Now you have to play with the electrical characteristics. Normally I just set my power supply to about 3V and limit the current to something non-explody. 200mA maybe? The memristor should behave like a bit like a diode. So one direction it'll short completely and in the other direction it'll read open or high resistance. Your yield will suck and that will be extremely frustrating. Probably what will happen is either you'll get open in both directions or short in both directions. If you see a short, you can loosen your bolts or reposition the piece of aluminum. Also try lowering the power supply voltage. If you see open, tighten the bolts or raise the voltage. Sometimes the memristors need breaking in. If your memristor is stubbornly open, try spiking the voltage to 10 or 20V while limiting current. Just don't stick your face too close to the memristor--if it blows, it'll emit a puff of toxic sulfur fumes. It won't kill you, but it's not nice. If you blow the memristor, you've damaged the sulfur layer so just move the aluminum piece to a new spot.  To convince yourself you have a memristor, you'll want to do an I-V plot. You can also hook the memristor up to your power supply. Run it in one direction. Measure the memristor's resistance. Then run it in the other direction and measure its resistance again. The memristor should store its last value for a while. Ideally it's many years, but mine drift a lot. Still, pretty good for the kitchen. Yeah, I mentioned fume hood. But really I did mine in the oven because I'm an impatient idiot. That's probably a bad idea. Be safe.  Anyway, there's many ways to do it. You just need an aluminum-copper(i) sulfide-copper junction. Silver-copper(i) oxide-copper also works, but it's hard to get a robust copper(i) oxide layer. Aluminum is annoying to use because you can't solder to it. There are other chemistries as well, but I haven't found any others that are accessible to ""normal"" people."

Essentially this is all research into new methods of computing that mimics the human brain and would allow for much better machine learning and a completely different form of computing as we currently utilize.

electronics,3bqvkk,confusiondiffusion,2,Wed Jul 1 23:31:44 2015 UTC,"The big idea is to have a real-valued memory. Digital computer memory happens in binary. Memristors have an infinite number of values between 0 and 1. Physical devices don't have infinite precision, but some people think that doesn't matter and that you may be able to compute things which aren't otherwise computable using real numbers even if you can't control them completely. I'm in that boat and I think there are a few others, though I think there's some hesitance to come out and say it for fear of ridicule.  A lot of commercial memristor storage concepts I've seen use memristors to store binary values. This is probably because memristors are much simpler to manufacture than NAND memory, at least in theory. I'm not sure what's holding HP up. They were supposed to have competitive memristor storage on the shelves by now. Maybe they can't compete with NAND yet.  Memristors could be used in lots of other places when it comes to analog circuit design. Imagine if analog circuits could adjust their own trim pots! Opamps could have automatic internal memristor offset nulling. The possibilities are endless."

electronics,3bqvkk,cafedude,7,Wed Jul 1 20:49:30 2015 UTC,Analog FPGAs with memristors would be very cool. It seems like with the (reemergence) of Neural Networks and deep learning something like that could usher in the of age analog computing - and that would be a reemergence as well since analog computing was a thing before digital computing was.
electronics,3bqvkk,Derpdiherp,2,Wed Jul 1 22:06:57 2015 UTC,"Reading the comments here I'm confused. Have I gotten the wrong end of the stick?  I thought the idea of these memristors was something like a transistor but using resistance, so rather than having the states 0-1 you can have a vast amount of states inbetween.   Wouldn't this be useful for fuzzy logic and other applications?  I'm guessing it would be used like an external register for a microprocessor for applications like the above? Or am I mistaken?"
electronics,3bqvkk,Fulcro,3,Wed Jul 1 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"Well, a transistor DOES use resistance, in that it is a variable resistor. Modern memory is capacitive and since the charge has to be sampled and renewed periodically, it's not set at a specific level."

Why the transistor helps I'm unsure, perhaps you are using it as a diode and that blocks some of the back EMF that happens during shutdown, lowering the time to recovery long enough for the psu to kick back in whole the motor is spinning (ie it only sees stall current the first time).   Two things to try:  Try putting a big capacitor in the lead.   Try using a diode to test the back EMF theory."

electronics,3btt6c,pleinairrider,4,Thu Jul 2 02:25:19 2015 UTC,In the USA you can send it in to Hakko for a free inspection usually. And you can buy genuine parts from hakkousa.com.
electronics,3btt6c,jgan96,3,Thu Jul 2 09:55:58 2015 UTC,I'd say the iron was probably at fault. Chinese equipment from ebay is often of poor quality. Sounds like the temp sensor or wiring was faulty. The LED on the base unit is on solid when the iron is heating and flashes when it is at dial temperature. If the temp sensor is faulty then the base station won't shut off the heater and it could possibly melt the handpiece.
electronics,3btt6c,weirdal1968,2,Thu Jul 2 02:56:43 2015 UTC,I'll go ahead and order another iron for this station then. Any vendors you could recommend weirdal1968?
electronics,3btt6c,FullFrontalNoodly,6,Thu Jul 2 03:30:42 2015 UTC,My suggestion is that you purchase a genuine Hakko iron instead of a cheap chinese knockoff.  There is a reason why the knockoffs are so cheap.
electronics,3btt6c,weirdal1968,2,Thu Jul 2 08:08:16 2015 UTC,"What he said. Putting cheap parts on a quality tool is a bad idea. I have a Hakko 470 that gets used almost every day in my workshop and there's no way I would use anything but Hakko parts for its recent rebuild. Should last for another decade...  Your Hakko knockoff iron might have been specifically for a knockoff and not a real 936. The eevblog guy did a teardown of a Chinese Hakko 936 knockoff and the stench of fugly was strong. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GdV7XBae74  Protip - my 936 came out of a dumpster.

The handles look the same, but the elements have differences in the temperature sensing, the elements are known as A1321 (usually hakko and some chinese stations), A1322 (many chinese 936 stations) and A1323 (stainless steel)  See this thread for more: http://www.eevblog.com/forum/reviews/genuine-vs-fake-hakko-936-ceramic-heater-a1321/"

electronics,3btt6c,weirdal1968,3,Thu Jul 2 06:53:21 2015 UTC,"Your station requires a specific type of heating element in the handle.    ""936"" is (because of history) a common moniker for chinese soldering stations, as well as the original Hakko.  There are 2 different ceramic heating elements used with ""936"" stations (and one stainless, but that's not important).  They look identical.  They are incompatible.  Both are used in various ""936"" stations.  The specific heating element you require depends on the ""936"" station.  If you use the wrong one, you may get results like this.  It likely wasn't faulty, just the wrong one."

electronics,3btt6c,triffid_hunter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:37:24 2015 UTC,"From the above link  If I'm not mistaken, the fake heater or most 936 clone are using thermocouple as the sensor, hence the low resistance.  While genuine Hakko uses PTC as sensor, both sensor's circuitries that are sensing the temperature are definitely different, mix used is not recommended since the wrong sensing result will end up bad thermal regulation or even toasting either the element or the driving circuit.  Also as Hakko's specification in the manual, the resistance of heater element (red wires) must be within 2.5 - 3.5 Ohm, while the sensor (blue wires) must within 43 - 58 Ohm. If the resistance is out of these range, the manual recommends to replace the heater.  Short version - knockoffs use a cheap sensor that won't work with real 936s and the iron may burn up."

At any rate, I looked at the cap near IC1 and upon closer inspection it seemed to be a replacement. Original caps are navy blue, this one was a black Rubycon, 63V 10uF, when it should be 16V. I also noticed that both electrolytic caps on the GB board are replacements, but in any case voltage on GB-1 ""kick"" is a steady 0V. I will try to replace as many caps around IC1 as I can with the ones I have on hand, but I'm not hopeful. Thank you very much for your input. I'll check for shorted pins on IC1 as well. I really want to fix this monitor. I got it for peanuts because the picture was a single horizontal line. I fixed that by replacing a single resistor on the board for vertical deflection.

EDIT: the reason I ask is because generally phono stage pre-amps will have a earth screw on the chassis. Just as a heads up, turntable outputs need to go through a dedicated phono stage to bring the signal to line level, before it can be further amplified for speakers or headphones. If you do have a preamp with a phono stage and it doesn't have a ground screw, you can generally use any screw on the chassis. In any event it's unlikely that you'll want to terminate that ground in a TRS jack."

electronics,3bru2w,fuzzydunnlop,4,Wed Jul 1 18:11:50 2015 UTC,"I was going to wire it to a 3.5 mm jack so I could used any device that has an Aux in port   Short answer: that's not going to work, you need a pre-amp.  Long answer:   The aux input (also called 'line in') in audio electronics is designed to accept a line level audio signal, which is generally somewhere around 1 volt. The output of things like cd players, mp3 players, smartphones etc. are line level signals (technically speaking headphone outputs are a little different but they're close enough for explanation purposes).   These signals aren't strong enough to work with speakers, even small ones, which require ~10 or more volts to work. So inside any device using speakers (car stereo, bluetooth speaker, hifi receiver etc.) is an amplifier circuit, which takes the 1 volt signal and amplifies it to the 10 or more volts needed to drive the speakers. Such a circuit is generally referred to as a power amplifier.    Not all devices are capable of producing the line level signal that a power amplifier expects for input, however, and a turntable is one of them (others include microphones, electric guitars). The electrical signal produced from dragging a needle across vinyl is very small, well below a ~1 volt line level signal. So an additional amplifier stage is required to bring that tiny signal from a few millivolts up to ~1 volt, and it is generally referred to as a pre-amplifier.  So the path from record to your ears looks something like  turntable -> phono pre-amplifier -> power amplifier -> speakers  So in order to hook up your turntable to a device with an aux port you're going to need a pre-amp, specifically a phono pre-amp."

The purposes of the equalization are to permit greater recording times, to improve sound quality, and to reduce the groove damage that would otherwise arise during playback.  The RIAA equalization curve was intended to operate as a de facto global industry standard for records since 1954. However, it is almost impossible to say when the change actually took place.   Before then, especially from 1940, each record company applied its own equalization; there were over 100 combinations of turnover and rolloff frequencies in use, the main ones being Columbia-78, Decca-U.S., European (various), Victor-78 (various), Associated, BBC, NAB, Orthacoustic, World, Columbia LP, FFRR-78 and microgroove, and AES.

I see your logic, but I don't think that will work to ground the ground cable to RCA. You are just going to end up damaging that cable and have to have a new one installed on the turntable, which is not a cheap fix.   Even if that did work, the sound level of the record player (~-40 db) is much too quiet to hear. Your normal electronics output a volume of ~-10 - -6 db.   Don't even try and cut any of those cables.

The impedance of the antenna will vary with freq. and then I can measure the ratio compared to a resistor in series with an ADC.   I just need some way of generating frequencies that I can step up. I mentioned the arduino because I want to use it to control some external device to step freq up."

Handling (as in getting them from one point to another) signals at 150MHz is not as trivial to as it might sound. No one bats an eyelash when hearing that WLAN uses carrier frequencys in excess of 5GHz, and processors clock their logic faster than 3 GHz, but even at 150MHz you will have to think about impedance matching, and wires don't have to be that long to have to be considered as transmission lines, especially when doing analog measurements."

electronics,3bmjb2,byroboy,2,Wed Jul 1 01:02:20 2015 UTC,"Mechanical holes are often unplated. Sometimes you want to avoid metal in parts of a circuit. For instance, slots used to isolate high voltages obviously can't have plating. Often around magnetic field or temperature sensitive components you have to control any metal placement carefully. Or the mouse bite problem OP was mentioning.  With these manufacturers it usually doesn't matter that they plate them, it's just annoying that you know even if you actually need it they won't do it. It's also annoying that they just don't follow your instructions. And it kinda looks bad, because you design pads differently when you're planning on using a plated hole, but that's minor."

electronics,3bmjb2,KlokWerkN,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:50:46 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this yesterday and only really came up with two answers;  1) for the smaller 'mouse-bite' holes, once they are plated it increases their strength which makes boards that utilise them a bit harder to snap off.  2) Increased risks of shorts. Some cheaper houses may leave a tiny tiny burr as a result of the plating process. On this design for example there is a mounting hole right next to a large pad designed for mounting a ring terminal. It's fully possible that a short could happen here (although in my case that's a connection to the PE and the mounting hardware would also be connected to the chassis so I think the worst that would happen is a ground loop?). I mostly use nylon mounting hardware so this shouldn't really be an issue for me."
electronics,3bmjb2,DrFegelein,2,Wed Jul 1 07:15:09 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, but what about the mouse bite holes? Those would have been added by the PCB shop, and surely you wouldn't want those plated.

electronics,3bmjb2,noiserr,2,Tue Jun 30 14:59:18 2015 UTC,I thought through-hole plating was something that was commonly seen on all the holes because the through-hole process generally can only be done on the whole board?

electronics,3bmjb2,gmanjake,2,Tue Jun 30 15:10:47 2015 UTC,I think that for non-plated drills a final drill pass would be completed at the same time that routing of tabs and irregular board shapes takes place.

electronics,3br15v,Wolf315,2,Wed Jul 1 13:28:07 2015 UTC,"The battery is a lithium cell right? 3.6 volts in the nominal voltage, the voltage that the cell spends most of its time at during discharge. Lithium cells are 4.2 volts fully charged and 3ish fully discharged (do not discharge lithium cells below 3.3 or 3.4 volts though for safety). So your charger has to be able to supply 4.2 volts to fully charge a nominal 3.6 volt cell.  Your charger is fine, also the power for the battery is probably watt hours or capacity where as the power for the charger is an instantaneous measure.  Also the plug pack you plug in the wall is not actually a charger. It doesnt even know it is attached to a battery. It is just a power supply, it just puts out 4.2 volts at a maximum of 0.6 amps all the time no matter what you plug it into. The actual Charger is inside the camera. A little silicon chip inside controls how much current the battery gets and at what voltage.  Your camera will have a range of voltages it can use. If it is too low the thing just wont be able to turn on and if it is too high your camera will either protect itself and shut down or parts of it will fry. If it is Really high things might even catch fire or explode. In general though probably anything over 4.2 volts will charge your battery, upto probably a safe maximum of 6 volts. But dont take my word for it, best to be safe."
electronics,3br15v,SkinnyFiend,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:47:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I have a follow up question though, I've heard that it's bad when the charger (or the power supply) has a lower milliamps than the battery it's bad for the battery. Not in this case the ""charger"" has 600mAh and the battery 740mAh. Will thise cause any problems?"
electronics,3br15v,SkinnyFiend,2,Wed Jul 1 16:00:00 2015 UTC,"Again these are two different things. The power supply is not measured in mAh, mAh stands for milliAmp hours. 500 mAh means that a battery can supply 500 milliamps for an hour before being empty, an hour is the standary for measuring battery capacity. 500 mAh in this case is 1C. But your battery may be able to supply 2C or even higher, some batteries can do like 5C and more. 2C for a 500 mAh means 1 Amp for half an hour, 3C is 1.5 Amps for 20 minutes and so on (might have messed up the maths there).   The powersupply can supply 0.6 of an Amp at 4.2 volts, this is an instantaneous value. It can supply 600 milliamps till the electrical grid fails. So the power supply is not mAh, just mA as it doesn't run out of juice after an hour.  In this case if you have a lower mA powersupply it just means you have to charge the battery slower. Which is actually safer for the battery but takes longer, and seeing as the battery is designed to be charged at a specific rate you may as well use that. Again even if you have a powersupply that can supply say 1000 milliamps or 1 amp rather than 600 milliamps, the charging chip inside your phone will regulate the current down anyway. If you have a higher power (power in watts = volts x amps) powersupply, the charger only takes what it needs (so long as the voltage isnt so high that it gets melted). If you have a lower power powersupply the charger uses everything it can but could use more to charge the battery faster.   A side note is that if you use say a 3.8 volt supply, then the charger can only charge the cell to 3.8 volts max which may only represent a 60% charge or something. This isnt bad for the battery really, it just means you arent using the full capacity of the battery."

Something like this:   Link   The output current from your controller is set by the size of your pull down resistor (the closest to the micro) to eliminate floating voltages. The output pin of your controller drives the gate of a set of N/P-Channel mosfets. The benefit of Neopixels running on 5V is that we can easily set up a top side driver for each set with one n channel and one p channel mosfet. You don't have to inverse your logic or anything. Decide how many Neopixels you want in each set, then drive the next N-Channel gate with the data out pin of the previous set's last Neopixel. In this way, you can power hundreds of NeoPixels with battery backup devices like snarfy linked, all without practically any current draw from your microcontroller and no necessary max current output for an individual power supply.  The only danger comes when your battery units aren't the same charge. Shouldn't be a huge issue with them being mos driven (they're very isolated), but you might want to do voltage monitoring on each of them.  HOLD UP. STOP.  WAIT. WAIT. Are your neopixels three pin? If so, just connect the + pin to each battery pack, and connect the data pins in series as usual."

Of course, I'd also add, the mosfets should be as quick switching as possible, and the N Channel's don't have to be high current at all, so getting them in high switch speed might be more economical."

This guy's datasheet claims up to 15A output (though I wouldn't go higher than 5), which is  180W! Your project could be run off of that $10 battery and a bunch of automotive 12V to 5V switching adapters, one 12V battery, and your neopixels broken into universes of like 30 to 40.

electronics,3bpamp,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:16:55 2015 UTC,"Bipolar junction transistor:       A bipolar junction transistor (BJT or bipolar transistor) is a type of transistor that relies on the contact of two types of semiconductor for its operation. BJTs can be used as amplifiers, switches, or in oscillators. BJTs can be found either as individual discrete components, or in large numbers as parts of integrated circuits.  Bipolar transistors are so named because their operation involves both electrons and holes. These two kinds of charge carriers are characteristic of the two kinds of doped semiconductor material; electrons are majority charge carriers in n-type semiconductors, whereas holes are majority charge carriers in p-type semiconductors. In contrast, unipolar transistors such as the field-effect transistors have only one kind of charge carrier.  Charge flow in a BJT is due to diffusion of charge carriers across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations. The regions of a BJT are called emitter, collector, and base.  A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped compared to the other two layers, whereas the majority charge carrier concentrations in base and collector layers are about the same. By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charges injected from a high-concentration emitter into the base where there are minority carriers that diffuse toward the collector, and so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.

Now I can sell them for $2000 dollars (which I’m about to sell soon.   There's more profit to be made from businesses though e.g. apartment complexes throw away refrigerators that don't work which there could only be a bad $.50 cent relay in the compressor terminals or a blown thermal fuse.

These are mostly gated with security though so you have to do some socialism and explain your situation to the security or the apartment complex owner/manager. Heck even UPS stores get a lot of things they throw away...I know this from experience. If a UPS item, during shipment, gets damaged, the buyer claims the store and gets his/her money back. The store most likely keeps the ""damaged"" item. That will probably find it easier to throw it in the trash. You can find a lot of cool stuff if you try hard enough.   That's my opinion at least."

I speak from experience here. I even asked why the broken rice grains could not be distributed for free among the workers, and I was told it was “mandatory”! Which that meant to the trash bin!  For containers that don't have security, you just go look and dig what you want. For those that have security, you explain to them that you are just trying to recycle. For those that want their trash taken away for free, you need a truck/trailer...get what you are interested in and throw away their junk that you don't wan in return. Mostly is just a matter of talking to them straight what your intentions are.   When confronted! You always talk to the supervisor and just explain your situation of just salvaging things.

The Datalink line was introduced in 1994 and it was co-developed with Microsoft as a wearable alternative to mainstream PDAs with additional attributes such as water resistance, that PDAs lacked, and easy programmability.  The early models included models 50, 70, 150 and model 150s (small size).  The model numbers indicated the approximate number of phone numbers that could be stored in the watch memory.  These early models were, at the time of their introduction, the only watches to bear the Microsoft logo.   The watches have been certified by NASA for space travel and have been used by astronauts and cosmonauts in space missions. There had been an evolution over the years as to the number and type of entries that can be stored in the various watch models as well as the mode of data transfer between computer and watch. At the time of its introduction the watch was considered high-tech.     Image i - The model 150. The optical sensor is clearly visible at 12 o' clock on the face of the watch.

So this is what I do currently.   Consumables should be in the easiest place to grab them. Filters, blades, grinding discs. Have them on a hook, or in a set of boxes. Stops you going ""nah, I'll just keep using this one"" and getting screwed when the blade slices your thumb open or the disc explodes. Also buy em in bulk. ""Oh, I only need one or two blades"" buy a pack of 100 semi-good quality ones. Saves you trying to make a blunt blade do a good job.   Drivers. Not sure if you're using replaceable bits or just screwdrivers. Good block (take a lump of wood, drill holes in it) is good for keeping them in order (do them TIP UP, so you can see the tip). Glue that into a toolbox, call it good. Bits, I tend to keep in a single good sizes component box (hey, I need a driver bit ... TO THE DRIVER BIT BOX!""). Or I buy them in bulk (posidrive bits, I tend to buy in boxes of 25). Those tend to live on a shelf as I find I don't use driver bits, or I use them for a whole day. No in between.   Toolboxes themselves. You want to move stuff about or just have it static? If its fairly static, just get a tool chest with drawers. Its big but you can get to everything. If you want to move stuff about a lot but be able to get to stuff quick, I'd suggest a good cantilever toolbox. Metal on both. None of this plastic junk that shatters when dropped.

electronics,3bi9y1,Enginner_is_spy,3,Sat Jul 4 05:10:54 2015 UTC,"A crystal radio uses just a diode in the configuration of what is called an ""envelope detector"", and the diode in one stage converts amplitude modulated RF into a voltage that is just the frequency of the modulation, giving an audio frequency wave. They are pretty crude, and you need a very strong signal to properly bias the detector diode. The galena crystal and wire form a crude diode, but a regular high speed diode can be used.  A radio that uses a crystal oscillator is using a two stage (or maybe three) down conversion of the RF and is a method called heterodyning (greek for ""energy mixing"").  Crystal radios were toys for kids to play with, because they were so cheap and simple and safe. I got my first one when Kennedy was in office. The cheap ones were a box of parts that included wire and a crystal and a headset, and you had to wind your own coils and find an old pine board to nail the parts to. It kept kids busy. Once you were able to hear one or two stations in your area, that was a win and then the radio would often end up in the closet. The set was drifty as hell, would sometimes pop and sputter in your ears, and the crystal commonly would lose contact. Very touchy rig.  Some amateur radio adults also would try crystal radio just for the bragging rights of how far they could DX... how far they could pull in a signal. The adults would use proper long wire antennas and it was a technical challenge, but otherwise their regular gear would be heterodyne receivers because they are much more sensitive and stable.  When I got older, we started to see ""transistor radios"", and then it became popular to build a heterodyne transistor version, but they are much more expensive and complex that just the crystal radio, and the transistors were very delicate. But it was a lot cheaper and easier than building a tube heterodyne, which used high voltages and needed a lot of watts."

Developed by early radio researchers Henry H. C. Dunwoody, G. W. Pickard and others, this device was used as the detector in early crystal radios, from about 1906 through the Second World War, and gave this type of radio receiver its name. Crystal radios were the most popular type of radio until the mid 1920s. The cat's whisker detector was the first type of semiconductor diode, and in fact, the first semiconductor electronic device. Cat's whisker detectors are obsolete and are now only used in antique or antique-reproduction radios, and for educational purposes.

In amongst the crackle and sputter, you can sometimes hear a distorted voice or music. These were not practical devices, they were toys for kids. Maybe that kid will become more interested and end up becoming an adult engineer with a radio shack in the back yard. =-}  In the early days, the only competitor to the crystal set was the tube heterodyne receiver, which used so much power that it either had to be plugged into AC, or you had to use expensive stack of lead acid cells to make a high voltage DC battery powered receiver.

I was using a short antenna and tuning to an AM tower about 1.5 miles away, and never tried it with a long antenna and distant stations.    I don't know how the first ones did it in 1910, since you'd have to both tune it and also manipulate the catswhisker (as well as tracking down bad connections, improving your ground, all at the same time.)

For some years I was a college professor and taught a course on RF communications, so I had to explain impedance matching and the behaviors of wave energy.  So my favorite was to tell the class they had to go down to the beach and watch the waves. To understand impedance matching, watch a ""shelf"" area that rapidly transitions from deep water to shallow. watch as the waves come in, and they hit that rapid change in impedance, and the waves build enormously, and some are actually reflected backwards towards the deep, as if there was a wall sticking up and reflecting them. The energy does not want to transfer forward. Then watch a sloping beach, and the waves smoothly transition from deep to the shoreline, with no reflection of the energy.  Also, to understand the action of wave energy interacting with an object, notice that a long wave that hit a pier piling just wraps around the piling, and goes right past it like it wasn't there. A small dimension relative to the wavelength becomes invisible. Now drop a rock near the piling, and notice the high frequency wave bounce off the piling. A wavelength  smaller than the object reflects off of the piling.  You can learn a lot from a trip to the beach. I figured my students were going to the beach anyway, so watching the wave behavior makes them do some studying while they were goofing off. They often came back and told me they had a much better understanding of the requirements of impedance for maximum energy transfer and antenna design theory, from just lying on the beach. =-}  Einstein did a lot of his thinking about relativistic velocities at a park, watching people ride their bikes."

Now imagine three things each tied to a piece of really strong and lightweight string: a feather, an anvil, and a baseball.  And I ask you to hit each of those with the bat.  First you try the feather. You can hit it very well and it gets a big increase in speed, but since the feather doesn't impart enough resistance to your force, the feather doesn't have a lot of energy.  Next you try the anvil. It definitely has a lot of kickback to your bat, but still the resultant energy of the anvil is minuscule because it has too much resistance changing the impact to a change in energy.  Now you try the ball. It has a satisfying hit, and the ball definitely flies with a lot of energy. It has approximately the perfect amount of resistance to your force, and the resulting change in energy is great.  That's kind of how impedance matching works. Think of impedance as the mass of the object, and the innate nature of bat-to-object contact as the source impedance. And the resultant energy transfer is sort of like the power transfer."

You can put the decoupling capacitors wherever you like in the schematic, it's their position on the board that's important, and the layout of the traces that connect them to the chip's pins.  ps: why does your schematic symbol have two ground pins? eagle lets you bind multiple pads to a single schematic pin when you're connecting"

Additionally they are carefully shielded, considering it could easily have relatively strong high frequency signals flying around nearby. The last point I remember is they also have a custom bus (the top, 3rd connector on the backplane (original source)) that allows internally shared clocks, triggers and maybe even some limited switching the parallel port - I guess the parallel port is more for backward compatibility with old instruments and communication systems rather than for an actual parallel port printer :)    Maybe I should stop anthropomorphizing my test equipment.

If you don't need this, don't bother.  That said...  Toner transfer works well -- if you happen to have the proper printer.  The older printers that do a better job are getting harder and harder to find.  Vinyl shelf material is the bomb for transfer.  Don't even bother with anything else.  Forget ferric chloride.  It is expensive, slow, messy, and a PITA to dispose of.  CuCl2 is the way to go.  Drilling holes in FR4 is a real PITA.  HSS bits get dull very quickly.  Carbide bits snap easily in a low-quality drill press.  The dust is toxic.  If you don't want to deal with this, be prepared to search for (and pay for) phenolic board stock.  Also, even with a reasonable drill press and carbide bits, drilling holes just sucks.  There is a lot of technique to making your own boards.  Prepare to spend a lot of time reading and learning before attempting on your own.  If you are not willing to do this, you really just want to have someone else makes the boards for you."

I prefer the epoxy based boards because they drill easy (if it's not a pure SMD board), and can be cut with score and snap easily.   The best two things I did was to stop using an iron and start using a a laminater for heat transfer. The other is using #0000 steel wool instead of acetone. I don't even use acetone anymore because the wool both cleans the copper better, and removes the toner post etch.    I can make a drilled board in under an hour now."

You'll need a vice for full-thickness boards, but thinner boards can be snapped by hand.  You really want to avoid using steel wool on PCBs.  It will leave micro-particles of steel which will rust.  Scotch-brite is much preferred here.  I've got the process down to where it takes no longer to make a PCB than it does a neat and pretty breadboard.

electronics,3bg6s2,1wiseguy,2,Mon Jun 29 16:00:53 2015 UTC,I used to use a ryobi hand drill.   http://m.homedepot.com/p/Ryobi-18-Volt-ONE-Lithium-Ion-Starter-Drill-Kit-P1810/205202601/  I was able to drill lots of holes before I broke a drill bit.  Even though I send my designs to dirtypcbs I still etch my own boards for things like break out boards.  It is a good skill to have.  One thing to keep in mind is the cost of tools.  How much are you going to spend and how many PCBs could you send away to get made for that amount of money.
electronics,3bg6s2,Blueebi,2,Mon Jun 29 00:52:47 2015 UTC,"For a minimal-resource (no computer required) quick-and-dirty one-off project you can begin and finish quickly, you can use a Sharpie laundry (waterproof) pen, a piece of copperclad, a 1mm drill bit and an etchant bath.  This method is only practical for projects with less than a dozen nodes (or components). Because complexity increases geometrically with the number of nodes. So, therefore, does the probability of error.  Total investment: Less than $10.  Less, if you make your own etchant  The result looks like stone-age crap, but in a good way.  Because it actually WORKS, and it is impossible to mistake it for a store-bought kit you merely stuffed-and-soldered to finish."

(Also printed on clear film and photo-resist a couple times)  Then ferric chloride bath with an aquarium bubbler for agitation.  Drilled the holes with a hand held drill -- PITA.  Also used a drill press, that worked better but was kinda scary.  However, the ""easiest"" way is to get someone else to do it.  I used 4pcb.com once for a prototype and they did a good job.  Solder mask, thru-hole plating, component marks, the whole job looked very professional.  Will cost more though.  I think I did 10 2""x3"" boards for about $90 but it was like 10 years ago.

It just became available, it's free, and it's basically the same as Altium Designer, which makes building your PCB a cakewalk. I haven't used Eagle extensively, because someone in my lab got me started with Altium, but a friend of mine had only ever used Eagle...until I showed him what Altium could do. It's worth using just for the push-pull engine, but it also has a massive library of basic parts and a dead simple wizard for building new, more complex parts."
electronics,3bg6s2,cmlaney,4,Mon Jun 29 01:40:48 2015 UTC,"It's a cloud based solution though. Which is meh imo. Besides, your designs not being available offline (which for me, I love working on PCBs on the plane), there is the whole: ""if the product is free, you're the product"" thing. And for the tin hat folks, Altium is a Chinese company now so they may have even less scrupules about misusing your data than an US based company.  PCB designing is a learning curve no matter which software you use. You still have to learn about how to leverage grids to layout footprints and PCBs, you will have to learn about netlists etc.. which you can only do by going trough it.  In my opinion KiCad is the way to go. It is fully open source and it has no restrictions. It's multi platform, and it has a great community. It has gained a lot of traction in the OSH movement and folks like CERN support it.  It has some quirks which can be hard at the beginning, but there are some great tutorials out there, also on youtube. The thing is even with its quirks it is still very enjoyable to use. Most of the problems are really just about setting up your project libraries and such. But the keyboard shortcuts are well thought out and once you get over the hurdles it becomes second nature and pretty easy to use. You just gotta stick with it.  Once you learn it, you're set. You never have to worry about switching because of imposed commercial restrictions. And even if you do decide to switch, you will know everything there is to know about PCB design because KiCad doesn't hide anything away from you.  I bit the bullet and decided to go trough the learning curve and I couldn't be happier now. Just last night at 9pm I thought of this circuit. And by 11:30 I have already submitted it to the PCB house for manufacturing.  https://i.imgur.com/MbAptxg.png  KiCad's file format is awesome too. For instance I scripted one of my FPGA designs so it automatically updated my FPGA constraints file from the way I laid out my board in the KiCad. Something I would have a hard time in a different tool. And if you're ever worked with FPGAs you'll know they have tons of pins and it can be really tedious to keep your pin layout and PCB design in sync.  So do yourself a favor. Don't invest time and effort in learning a restricted tool, which you will either outgrow or it may go away, learn a tool like KiCad and never have to worry about having to learn another PCB design software again."

Also I have tons of breakout boards for SMD ICs.  But for real PCBs I am afraid the PCB house is a no brainer. The biggest problem is how long it takes. OSH park has been really slow for me lately. I submitted a board 2 weeks ago and it still hasn't entered production. Meanwhile Dirty PCBs already shipped theirs. Dirty PCBs are actually faster for me if I pick expensive shipping option.  The quality isn't as good, but at least I actually get to pick the solder mask color."

I'm also assuming, perhaps dangerously, that the sheer luminous flux of this thing keeps OP from operating it too close to his or her face. 2.5kW in a room will make things mighty hot mighty fast and I'd imagine all you would see close to this thing is spots. It is after all a nearly point source of 100k lumens!  I'm also concerned about outright softening of the material due to excessive heat. It turns out these type XBO lamps have a large emission in the 800-900nm range which is concerning. Up to 10% of the output is in this near IR range. (ouch!)   Soft polycarbonate doesn't do so well for shrapnel protection. It would probably do best with a structurally solid metallic reflector and some pretty thick glass in front of the polycarbonate. The socket or lack thereof is another concern as motion of the lamp is probably quite detrimental to arc stability. OP might have sufficient cooling given the bulb temp but the ozone still has to be dealt with depending on the lamp type. (Ozone free variants exist.)  For an idea of what a proper fixture looks like and to get an idea of its safety features, see this lamp installation video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yaAsFyaSss  Anyway...if OP wants a far safer high flux lighting solution for area lighting, I have an idea....  It turns out from a lm/W standpoint, Xenon short arc is rubbish and OP has a far superior solution for general lighting available: Medium Arc HID, Metal Halide in this case. Metal Halide is twice as good in the 1kW+ range. I can get 100k lm easily with a 1kW MH lamp. Shrapnel protection on those is just plate glass in front of the lamp or in the case of protected metal halide, no glass at all! Protected MH has a thick glass sleeve around the inner arc tube.  Also you get very low UVA and UVB and zero UVC due to the external glass envelope which means no skin burns and no ozone to corrode things and seriously irritate your eyes and respiratory tract. Coated MH bulbs put out basically zero UV at all. (the coating is a phosphor that converts the UV into visible light)  I actually light my room with a 100W MH fixture. It's not quite a daylight simulator but it's quite nice. I get all the illumination of a 500W halogen floor lamp without the sweltering heat. It's a totally enclosed fixture with a pulse start ANSI M90 ballast and a grounded chassis. I have experienced one catastrophic lamp failure. The lamp and fixture contained it nicely which is good considering the arc tube glows red hot under several atmospheres in routine operation! It did make quite a pop though!"
electronics,3bbgpt,x65535x,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"One idea i had was to use two layers of plastic with some air between them, kind of like a whipple shield.  Even if the inner layer is penetrated, the shrapnel will be slowed down or made smaller, getting absorbed by the second layer.  Some times i'm really tempted to just test it. But i'll have to wait either for another such lamp or for a high speed camera."
electronics,3bbgpt,loansindi,0,Sat Jun 27 23:55:21 2015 UTC,That would likely give more than adequate protection from both debris and UV if you use polycarbonate. You could have one clear and one diffuse as well if you wanted a lamp of unusual power.  The lamps are shipped in heavy polycarbonate cases. I'm unsure the thickness but its at least a few mm.

If the gestures are tuned right, it should feel like its magically always on when you want it to be.  Those gesture recognition algorithms, though, are also a tradeoff in ensuring its wakes when you want it while minimizing false positives.

If turn to wake gestures are disabled, then double-tap is the only way to turn it on -- so basically zero false wakeups.  That should extend battery life a small amount.   The battery life is completely a function of how often you turn it on and for how long.  If you looked at it only once a day for 5s, then it should last about 15 months.

I'm sure you are aware of how easily an smd component can be broken off of a PCB. I realize that since the case does not have an open case back that pressing a mineral crystal into the case is out of the question (not removable). However, you could use a thin disc of polycarbonate or acrylic.  The PC/acrylic disc could have the same 4 bolt pattern as the pcb drilled into it so that it could be easily mounted and removed for battery changes. In addition to protecting the watch internals it would be much easier to clean."

You should really do this with an isolation transformer or at least a GFCI.  And a suitable fuse in the hot side for fire safety.  First problem, if that's a half-watt resistor, you will hit its rating at sqrt(.5/1000) = 22 mA.  Second problem, even if you shorted that resistor across the line (and it didn't catch fire instantly), you'd be limited to 120 mA.  A difficult thing with getting an amp this way is that you'd need less than about 110 ohms in series with the diode bridge, which at 60 hz is on the order of 24 µF.  Unfortunately it tends to get hard to find a non-polar capacitor of that size and voltage rating."

Add 2 4072 (Dual 4-input OR gates) so in this design with 4 elements (""2"",""0"",""1"",""5"") you could wire each OR gate output to a drive transistor to each element.  First 0-3 decade outputs to 1 of each of the OR inputs. Wire decade output 5 and 7 to each OR's additional input.  Pull the last OR inputs low.  This should give you a pattern of:   2, 0, 1, 5, ----, 2015, ----, 2015, ----, ----   Instead of the 4072s you could use diodes.  Pull down the drive transistor bases. Wire diodes from decade outputs 0-3 to each transistor base 1-for-1.

I'm already using the 555 and 4017 for chasing individual leds, was just wondering how to smoothly transition to a all-leds flash. I was thinking of using a primary counter to distribute the clock signal to the 4017s for the chasing and then to another circuit (haven't thought what though ) for the all-led flashing.   Thanks for the ideas and the schematic, I didn't really understand the OR gate functions but I'll go through it again. I think I have some lying around, definitely have some XOR."

Just get a flux pen or something similar, drench the bridged pins with it, and touch your soldering iron once, briefly, to the solder bridge. It should come apart very nicely.  The soldering iron must be clean for this (wipe off any excess tin off the tip).  Clean the flux afterwards.  Btw, the part that's bridged is not an IC, but an array of 3, 100 ohm resistors, in a single package."

electronics,3axbdz,eddiek85,31,Wed Jun 24 06:34:55 2015 UTC,"First off, voltage is not power.  Voltage is simply pressure, or height.  Only when charges (usually electrons, and measured in coulombs) are moved by a voltage do you get energy transfer. Current (amps) is the number of coulombs of charge per second, and Power (watts) is the rate of energy transfer, ie voltage × current.  .  Connected directly? You blow something up. Electronics are generally not very tolerant of their max voltage being exceeded, and tend to complain by releasing their internal magic smoke which is necessary for them to function.  If you feed it through a linear regulator (eg 7805), the regulator burns off the excess voltage as heat, in proportion to the load current.  Pheat = (Vin - Vout) × I, and Tj = Tambient + Pheat × Rθj-amb.  If Tj exceeds Tj_max (typically 125-175°C) your regulator will shut down or possibly explode.  Rθj-amb depends on the regulator package and any heatsinking you have provided. The TO-220 package (standard for 7805) has an Rθj-amb of 62.5K/W, and thus without a heatsink can safely dissipate only 1-2 watts (depending on Tj_max),  Given Vin=9v, Vout=5v, and Iout=1A, the regulator will dissipate (9-5)×1=4W of heat. A heatsink is definitely necessary.  If you feed it through a switchmode regulator (eg LM2596), it takes less current from the input than it delivers to the output, eg while providing 5V at 1A it may only take 0.65A from the 9v supply.  Note that the input power (V×I) always exceeds the output power (with the difference dissipated as heat in the switcher), they're not free energy devices by any means.  In most cases, a switchmode regulator will dissipate significantly less heat than a linear regulator, but they are also somewhat more complex to design. Self-contained switchmode modules are ubiquitously available online.  Pheat = (Vout×Iout) ÷ efficiency.  Given Vin=9v, Vout=5v, Iout=1A and an 85% efficient switcher, it will dissipate 0.9W of heat. A heatsink may not be necessary, especially as those 0.9 watts will be shared between multiple separate components. The input power is thus 5.9W, and 5.9W ÷ 9V = 0.65A."

electronics,3axbdz,netl,-1,Wed Jun 24 07:43:14 2015 UTC,"The only way you could know you ""have a 5 volt circuit"" is if the elements were all diodes with a combined forward voltage of 5V. The problem with supplying this with 9V is that the current through the circuit would be theoretically near infinate and, as FullFrontalNoodly said, in real life will destroy the circuit very fast. This is because voltage is pressure, like triffid said. A 5V circuit, like a couple LEDs, would leave 4V. What consumes those 5V? Theresistance of the wire connecting the 9V to the circuit. Did you just cringe? I hope so. Diodes don't regulate current, they just step down voltage. So the only thing regulating current would be the wire or trace's resistance, which may be less than 1 milliohm. Ohm's law states I = V/R = 4/0.001 = 4000 amperes. Your 5V circuit is now dissipating 4V * 4000A = 16kilowatts. Off a 9V battery. THIS is why fundamental circuit theory is so important. Little, tiny, cheap components can light fires, man."
electronics,3axbdz,NoReallyItsTrue,-1,Wed Jun 24 21:16:09 2015 UTC,As you know V*I = P which would tell you that as you lower the voltage your current will increase to keep P constant. So if you had 9 volts @ 1 amp that would mean P = 9 so when you lower the voltage the current will go up to keep P equal to 9.  Of course in practice there is some lost to heat during the conversion because no dc to dc converter is 100% efficient.

There's literally no path, in or out, unless your drain goes negative compared to the source, then you'll get body diode, and most likely ESD diode, conduction.  You can't leave inputs floating, since you have an undefined Vgs, which is what controls the FET."
electronics,3atpbm,TagSmile,6,Tue Jun 23 19:42:48 2015 UTC,"Let's bear in mind that I'm working off of memory here from my IC fab course, and I don't deal with ICs on a day-to-day basis.  I still remember at least one lecture on this, stressing why you need to physically prototype everything before handing off a package.  In a perfect world, you would get no current flow.  However, imperfect dies, static charge, the Miller effect (moreso in signals than straight DL), and non-infinite closeoff impedances all result in some interesting behaviour in cascaded circuits.  Can you predict what will happen to the gate if the drain sees a high static charge?  On paper, not much - if the channel hits breakdown, the charge is immediately dissipated through to the source and the channel goes back to pinchoff.  In reality, if it's a cheap or very tight die, that voltage will start to reflect on nearby components through proximity charging well before VD-S breaks down.  In fact, you'll find that VD-S will be pretty much exactly the breakdown voltage, provided you can measure it without dissipating the charge.  A lot of cascaded circuits don't have pulls on their internally-controlled gates to save on power consumption and heat generation (as they assume all pins will have paths through which to dissipate static charge).  This spells disaster when proximity charge starts pulling physically adjacent gates up into the ohmic region, and everything with a path to ground starts heating up.  It's more a concern for IC fab than anything else, but it's always good to keep in mind.  You don't usually know how the die is laid out, and something as innocent as a high-Z output can have disastrous consequences if the IC designer didn't think or care about what would happen if you use the chip in a fashion not prescribed on the sample circuits.  There are definitely some screwy off-brand 7400-series logic chips out there that will go nuts from static charge if you leave any outputs on them in high-Z.  One brand was ""TJ"", some cheap imitation TI stuff that my school decided to buy.  It started out as a purchasing mistake, but they keep using their old stock as a teaching tool.  TL;DR: There's at least one very valid reason to listen to the datasheet if it tells you to pull your unused open-collector outputs."

Thanks for the insight.   listen to the datasheet if it tells you to pull your unused open-collector outputs   Of course! I've just never seen this for something like a standard logic gate.  For the imitation parts, defensively designing for parts outside of the datasheet specs seems like a losing battle, but I suppose ESD would be the worst offender for an imitation part that you wouldn't be able to catch in a production test."

electronics,3atpbm,Lusankya,19,Tue Jun 23 21:07:05 2015 UTC,"The recommended practice is to pull the inputs of unused gates low or high. If they are left floating they can change back and forth and possibly cause EMI or damage to the part.  In this schematic it looks like the designer has inputs of unused gates connected to existing logic signals, and the outputs connected to ground through a resistor.  The best guess I can think of for doing something like this would be to have an easier spot to attach a probe to look at that signal. I don't think this is actually the case for this circuit given the large components all over would be easy to probe."
electronics,3atpbm,buildelectronics,3,Tue Jun 23 14:43:18 2015 UTC,"It feels as if the designer is following company policy instead of good design practices.  In high speed digital designs, there is often a concern about parasitic inductance from outputs.  One way to reduce that possibility is to load match the output - in much the same way you would tune an antenna with a load.  But this isn't a high speed design.  So it feels like the designer is applying a ""rule of thumb"" that he learned in other designs, and that doesn't apply here.  For a brief time, my last employer had a policy of pulling the inputs AND outputs of extra gates high or low through 0805 resistors, and then stuffing or not stuffing with zero ohm resistors.  The idea was that the gates could be jumper wired into the circuit if needed.  This led to a small EE revolt against this stupid directive."

electronics,3atpbm,TagSmile,54,Tue Jun 23 19:49:15 2015 UTC,Maybe the designer quoted a ridiculous price for the circuit and felt he needed to make it look 'complicated' to trick the customer into thinking it was worth the money.

The fact is that if you pulldown those LS00 inputs to a logic low, then you have a steady state logic high output (four of them).  This circuit only makes sense if -5v is actually digital ground.  Then all pulldown's are actually pullup's.  It also is good practice to pullup unused open collector gates (LS06), so that you can actually use them as spares if you need to without having to deadbug a resistor."

I'd rather draw in an RC with an NPO going into a Schmitt-trigger, or an outright LC delay, so I've got a time-lapse I can count on, if I can't gate it to a clock."

electronics,3atpbm,anangusp,2,Wed Jun 24 11:15:34 2015 UTC,This looks like it would only increase the likelihood of a component failure - either a gate going bad or by adding traces & extra unneeded complexity. Daft.

electronics,3atpbm,gmarsh23,3,Tue Jun 23 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"If you've got spare gates and a card has a 1 layer PCB, or a 2 layer PCB with a lot of routing and no convenient ground/VCC trace nearby, I can understand driving unused gates with an adjacent signal. Like on a 7404 inverter for example, typing input pin 9 directly to pin 10 instead of running a trace over to pin 14 or down to pin 7.  And pulldown resistors on logic gate outputs aren't uncommon, it ensures that a valid logic 0 level is present during startup or brownout conditions when there's not enough Vcc present for the gate to pull the output to a good 0 or 1 level. This helps avoid logic metastability, which can cause bad things to happen, potentially leading to very bad things in a critical application. Probably no reason to do it on a logic gate that drives nothing though, other than doing it out of routine.  It's easy to look at a circuit like this and judge it, thinking you can do better. But you never know, the engineer who designed it may have a perfectly good explanation for what they came up with."

I've liberated power mosfets, capacitors, and other components from computer motherboards without fuss, and you know how difficult those can be with an iron :)  I've even had passable success soldering fine pitch ICs by simply laying thin solder along the pins and heating the board from below, just a few bridges to clean up with the iron. Paste is of course massively better for this :P  Another hint: turn the temp down to 100-130°C and try it on hot glue, you'll be amazed at the results you can get!

There's no reference point to measure from, so you cannot say what the voltages are relative to each other.  For everything else, draw a 0V next to every ground symbol.

In diagram b, you have a 12V battery connected between A and B, with the negative terminal connected to B. This produces 12V at A. If the battery was backward (negative terminal at A), then you would subtract its voltage (yes, it's OK to have a negative voltage, they're relative values, not absolutes).

There are different levels of failures and all but catastrophic ones are typically correctable in some way. Corrupt data from a setup time violation (maybe overclocking too much for example) can be fixed by, well, restarting and clearing the data, and not overclocking as much. ECC-memory can fix noise-induced corrupt data (to an extent) across a physically long bus like a SATA cord or PCB trace. Blue screens aren't even always considered catastrophic failures in some regards. Etc.  MTBF is typically, colloquially speaking and in my experience, a stat about failures you have to do some non-built-in repair or replacement to fix - and you, for all intents and purposes, can't fix the silicon on a microprocessor after it's been fabbed (there are ways, but those are in a lab to diagnose specific problems and ruin the chip). About the only thing you can do to fix a damaged chip is to have a fuse designed in that you can blow to physically disconnect that part of the chip from the rest of the working silicon.  Not only that, MTBF doesn't always take into consideration how much can be done between failures, which is sometimes the more useful stat. If a 1 GHz processor and a 4 GHz processor (all else equal about them, including design, architecture, fabrication process, program, etc.) have the same MTBF of x hours, the 4 GHz processor gets ~4x (ideally) work done between failures.  These are all reasons why a ""MTBF"" of ""20 minutes"" on a super computer isn't really that surprising, at least to me."

electronics,3amtn4,fatangaboo,3,Mon Jun 22 15:09:32 2015 UTC,"Looks like 3 things (without getting in to detail):  1) Very long, unshielded, single-ended wire buses.  Theses have a high capacitance and other negative properties which severely limit transmission speed of pure digital signals.  2) Ripple carry adder/subtractor.  Any carry/borrow results of the individual 1-bit adders have to propagate up the whole 16-bit chain, which means 16x gate delay before getting the true result.  Adding carry look-ahead circuitry would cut this down to 1 or 2 gate delays but adds more circuitry.  3)  Non-complimentary gate outputs.  To save on transistors the outputs of each gate uses a pull-up resistor to generate a high and a transistor to generate the low.  So the transition from low to high will take much longer than high to low."

electronics,3aohfo,markus_b,2,Mon Jun 22 05:33:14 2015 UTC,"As others have said, any 12V audio amp will do. 4 Ohm is the standard impedance for speakers. Most car amps go down to 2 Ohm too.  Amazon has a thousands:  http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=car+amplifier  One remark: In audio amplifiers there are lies, damned lies and watts. Lots of them show huge watt-numbers, measured their phantastic marketing department.  A normal 12V amp in a bridge configuration can do about 16W RMS with a 4Ohm speaker. That is why you see all car radios having 4x16W RMS power as standard.   If it has more power it needs an internal power converter to convert the 12V to a higher voltage. This is expensive.  But 16W RMS is quite adequate to listen to music. I use a Toshiba Aurex SB-A10 amplifier at home. It has 2x24W output power. This is plenty for listening at home.  You may want something like this cheapie ($10): http://www.amazon.com/Kinter-Digital-Audio-Power-Amplifier/dp/B007TUSXEY The specs say 2x100W (2x4W RMS) YMMV."
electronics,3aohfo,madscientistEE,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"As stated, car amps are the way to go for 12V but unless 12V operation is essential, I don't recommend 12V amps for home use.  You will need a sizable power supply for 100W output, 12V @ 15-20A or so for class AB, 12V at 10A for class D. This power supply may increase your costs significantly leaving mains voltage operated devices a more attractive option if 12V operation is not essential.  Any 12V high power amp with honest ratings will contain an isolated step up converter because it's impossible to shove 50W into a 4 ohm load with a single 12V supply. This double conversion from mains to 12V and back to another voltage degrades efficiency significantly. (You'll lose at least 20% in the double conversion!)  If 12V operation isn't essential, something like this may be worth purchasing: http://www.parts-express.com/dayton-audio-dta-120-class-t-mini-amplifier-60-wpc--300-3800  Designing amps is tricky business. Layout is of the utmost importance with analog and especially high power analog to get good THD+N performance and stability. There are kits but very few contain the necessary step-up converter. You can get the converters separately but then costs rise and it ends up cheaper to just buy a commercially available mains powered amp."

You got some no-clean flux there, but I still suggest getting an alcohol to clean parts with. Dried up or old flux residue can mess up future soldering/re-soldering if you use too much. And flux can cause shorts too if it's particularly bad. And who doesn't love clean-looking soldering after-the-fact? Also, if you're using standalone flux, I'd advise against pre-fluxed solder just because it adds to the mess. (But pre-fluxed solder is great, just be aware you won't ever be able to re-shape [any] solder without applying more flux again... pre-fluxed solder without some standalone flux is going to be ""did I solder it right the first time? no? Remove solder and start again"" every time. Non-pre-fluxed solder is similar but you apply the flux manually and add as much as you feel is needed) Get a stand of some sort with a magnifying glass. I hate ones with clips for any sizable PCB, I ended up using something like this during Senior Design about this time last year, absolutely amazing grip and 'turnability.' You can use a standalone magnifying glass too. A desk lamp, with bright white light is good. Bright white helped me see PCB components a lot better than any other color IMO. My Senior Design lab had a table-mounted magnifying glass with a lamp on one side of it kind of like this which was super useful. Lets you have the bright light focused on the current part under a magnifying glass without it being in my eyes like a desk lamp might have. Grounding/antistatic wriststrap and grounding/antistatic pad to do work on. You should be working on top of the pad (not you literally, the tools and component(s)), the strap should be connected to the pad (via a snap, kinda like the snap button on some jeans) and to you, and the pad should be connected safely to a ground source."

electronics,3ajako,benders_game,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:24:14 2015 UTC,"Digital Audio Broadcasting:       Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) is a digital radio technology for broadcasting radio stations, used in several countries across Europe and Asia Pacific.  The DAB standard was initiated as a European research project in the 1980s.  The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) launched the very first DAB channel in the world on 1 June 1995 (NRK Klassisk),  and the BBC and SR launched their first DAB digital radio broadcasts in September 1995. DAB receivers have been available in many countries since the end of the 1990s. DAB may offer more radio programmes over a specific spectrum than analogue FM radio. DAB is more robust with regard to noise and multipath fading for mobile listening [citation needed] , since DAB reception quality first degrades rapidly when the signal strength falls below a critical threshold, whereas FM reception quality degrades slowly with the decreasing signal.  Audio quality varies depending on the bitrate used and audio material. Most stations use a bit rate of 128 kbit/s or less with the MP2 audio codec, which requires 160 kbit/s to achieve perceived FM quality. 128 kbit/s gives better dynamic range or signal-to-noise ratio than FM radio, but a more smeared stereo image, and an upper cut-off frequency of 14 kHz, corresponding to 15 kHz of FM radio.  However, ""CD sound quality"" with MP2 is possible ""with 256…192 kbps"".

electronics,3ajako,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:25:09 2015 UTC,"The term ""transistor radio"" appeared when transistors overtook tubes as the amplifying element in radios, and made compact portable radios possible in the '60s and '70s. Transistors were the new-fangled sexy thing and radios were emblazoned with their transistor count the way that mechanical watches had their jewel count inscribed. The most common transistor radios were shirt-pocket sized and received AM radio stations. Larger transistor radios received FM broadcasts as well.  Both AM and FM radio circuits were analog.  Nowadays integrated circuits allow such complexity and speed and are so inexpensive that it is feasible to use digital methods to modulate and demodulate audio, so we are seeing digital radios.   The advantage of digital radios is that they are not subject to the same types of imperfections as AM and FM (static, distortion, and drift). Today the most common digital radios can receive subscription satellite broadcasts like XM, but unlike digital TV broadcasts, we haven't phased out analog radio yet.  Digital radios contain integrated circuits incorporating large numbers of microscopic transistors. Because all radios are transistorized these days, the term transistor radio is rarely used these days."
electronics,3ajako,macbrett,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:01:45 2015 UTC,"Transistors have two modes of operation.  They can act as amplifiers -- varying a large current in proportion with changes in a smaller current -- or the can act as switches -- using a small current signal to turn on or off larger currents.  A normal transistor radio, receives an analog signal modulated on a carrier frequency on their antenna.  The signal is split from the carrier and is amplified by transistors, which drive a speaker.  In digital radio, the signal being transmitted is inherently digital -- a stream of ones and zeros.  A computer with special signal processing capability unpacks the ones and zeros into audio and/or data streams which can be stored, amplified, etc."

electronics,3ak5x0,jaseg,2,Sun Jun 21 02:35:56 2015 UTC,If you want a white light but you want it to have colour in the reflection then probably the easiest way is to use polarization. Put RGB leds in the globe with different polarization on the one you want to see with color in the reflection. Then put a polarizer on  the mirror. Large polarizers can probably be obtained cheaply too due to LCD tvs using them..  If you want to be more expensive then you need to turn the mirror into a large tv by putting an LCD panel over it with just one very large segment. Timing the panel with the LEDS then you can have any colour in the reflection. Whats more you can do it at a few hundred hertz. Unfortunately a custom panel would probably cost you from a few hundred to a few thousand.

Light goes ~1 ft/ns so if you could achieve that each 'ft' of the tunnel would be a different colour. I'm currently looking into this and few ns should be possible.

A slightly cheaper variant is the PAC Pxdx - but make sure to get the appropriate cable for your car/stereo.  You can also go to a junkyard and look for a cd changer for your vehicle, you may be able to take the changer and its adapter and spoof an input into that.    Check the forums for your make and model and read up about options for your stereo, but frankly it's probably cheapest and easiest to just go with a prebuilt solution like that, unless you want to get balls deep into programming and protocol analysis."

Plus another cludgy adapter to make the steering wheel controls work. Other than the lack of Aux input it's a great sounding radio. Lacking a bit of bass at higher volumes but I'm almost never turning it up that high.

That is connected to a custom PCB which I made for another project - that custom circuit board lets me get gps data and has some extra pins in the lower right corner that I'm using to connect to the Fona and some other stuff. I have a simple 5v relay which is normally-closed which when opened will disable the fuel pump. If you pull the battery on the car attempting to reset the computer, it will read from the internal EEprom and cut the fuel pump again when plugged back in. I may convert it to be normally-open later for better security, but right now I'm kind of testing things still so I need to be able to disable it. Ideally the most secure method would be hiding another computer in the engine bay near the fuel pump relay that has a ttl/serial connection to this one and needs to receive a command to turn on/off, but I'm not that worried about it.  I have a second circuit board which is a very simple RC-Time circuit which has a series of cascading transistors (three BJT and a relay for one, a mosfet for the other). Once the RC circuit gets to a certain voltage it swings and turns off the output. This is what's being used to time the shutoff of the cameras and tracker."

electronics,3afbhy,FullFrontalNoodly,27,Fri Jun 19 20:29:38 2015 UTC,"Funny that somebody down voted you. I think this is actually an important distinction.  There's no way that a handful of AA batteries can source enough current to crank a car:  1) AA capacity is listed in mA, whereas a car batteries cranking amperage is several hundred Amps.  2) AA batteries have a much higher internal resistance than a car battery. Even setting aside the capacity isssue, this internal resistance will severely limit current.  He's trickle charging the battery. Of course, that would be an exercise in futility if the car battery weren't nearly charged to begin with.  He does make this point in the video, but kind of skims over it."

A few clarifications on your comments though.  11.75 volts indicates the battery is at about 20% charge capacity.  However, this is very close to the point where some cars won't start.  Most likely he drained the battery just to the point where it wouldn't start the car, and then added just enough of a charge for one good start.  Because the battery was substantially discharged, applying 19V to the battery he was doing a bulk charge -- the very opposite of a trickle charge."

electronics,3afbhy,vuudoodude,2,Sat Jun 20 01:10:38 2015 UTC,Trickle charging does indeed have to do with the rate of charging.  In a trickle charge you are supplying current equal to the self-discharge rate.  For automotive batteries this is typically in the range of 10 -100 mA.

electronics,3afbhy,jaseg,1 point,Sun Jun 21 11:36:00 2015 UTC,"Geez.  It's really not that important of a distinction in this case, but I'll entertain the discussion:  You seem to be bothered by the fact that I chose to use mA instead of mAh, the real issue is that I used the term capacity when what I really meant to say was a bit more akin to current rating.  When you're talking about cranking amps, you're really talking about instantaneous current because you're looking at the peak current required to overcome the inertia of the crank at rest.  If there's anything to take exception to, that's it.  Personally, I'd rather shrug off these sorts of subtleties most of the time because it's not central to the point. What is central is that you'd need a huge number of AA cells to actually jump start the car, and it's quite possible that the internal resistance of the cells themselves would limit the current somewhere below the cranking Amperage."
electronics,3afbhy,vuudoodude,3,Tue Jun 23 04:14:31 2015 UTC,"There's no way that a handful of AA batteries can source enough current to crank a car:   That really depends on how many AA batteries you wire up. Example. As letterman used to say, volume, volume, volume!  With the proper series - parallel arrangement you most certainly could start a car wit AA batteries alone."

electronics,3afbhy,DirtyPolecat,2,Sat Jun 20 00:35:11 2015 UTC,"I know the scene.  I'm not sure.  They do have the crank connected to a defacto generator, and while the mechanical work that you can produce by hand turning the crank is small compared to doing it with a motor, as long as you're producing a voltage higher than the battery voltage, and assuming there's a regulator diode on the output of the generator, it seems to me that it could work.  The show indicates that they're at it for a really long time, physically exhausted and trading places...  Anyone with some physics background want to take a stab at how long it would take to charge the battery on the Winnebago?"
electronics,3afbhy,vuudoodude,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:15:36 2015 UTC,"Well, a car battery could be 80 Ah at 13 - ish volts, that's total of about 1000 Wh for the fully charged battery. Using legs it would be pretty easy to produce 200 watts of mechanical energy, so you'd have to do that for 5 hours, to charge the battery fully, with 100% efficiency.  From this graph , at 10% of the charge you get yourself 11.7 volts which seems like it must be sufficient to start the car.  As far as I can tell the lead acid battery's discharging internal resistance does not rise much at low charge levels. So that shouldn't keep you from starting the car.  With 10% of charge thus you'll need 30 minutes of charging, maybe an hour allowing for huge inefficiencies and uncertainty about 10%.  Using arms, I don't know how much power you can produce. I do not remember the scene. If I had to do it I would repeatedly use my legs to pull a cord wrapped around something, with a counter weight to turn it back, or come up with some other mechanical scheme to use legs provided it doesn't take too long.  If you had to only provide enough power for 1 crank, without having to charge a fully dead battery up to the necessary voltage, a crank is, say, 5 seconds at 200 amperes at 12 volts, so, 12 kJ, which you'll produce in 2 minutes at 100 watts. Or in just a few seconds if you're an athlete.   Which makes perfect sense as back in the day engines were turned over by hand using a special crank handle. Using a rope it may be possible for both of them to start the engine by pulling the rope - wrapped around some pulley in the belt system - with all their might.  If your car is stick shift and not in a desert you can start it by pushing it to where it gains enough speed and then switching into gear. That's without having to go the mechanical-electrical-mechanical route with all the inefficiencies."

electronics,3afbhy,_ben_lowery,2,Sun Jun 21 11:21:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know the scene, but if you cranked long enough, you could charge the battery sufficiently. An old trick to get your car running when the battery is just a bit too discharged to crank is to shut everything off, stand up on the front of the car, and kick the battery repeatedly (to shake it). Do this for 5 minutes. Let it sit for 30, then give it another go. Chances are they'll be enough juice to give it one good crank and get it started.  They sell small solar panels that plug into your cigarette lighter and fit on the dash to keep your battery topped off if it's going to sit a while. They work great. Maybe too well. If left unchecked they'll over charge the battery and boil off the electrolyte.   Charging is a rate times time equals distance time of affair. You don't need a huge source to charge a large battery. A little bit over a long time is just fine."

electronics,3afbhy,FullFrontalNoodly,10,Sat Jun 20 03:03:10 2015 UTC,"He says on his webpage that one of the reasons he added the 1 ohm resistor is to limit the current through the batteries.    However, without that resistor, I calculate that the current would have been 2.74A instead of 2.0A.  Was it truly necessary other than to provide convenient test points?    Edit:  I typed up what appears below as part of a reply to someone who replied to my question, but by the time I was done, the comment had been deleted.  I figured I might as well add it in so my calculations are shown.  Minor mistake in calculations also fixed.    He measured his 12 AA batteries in series at 19.4V at no load (1.62V per battery).    After connecting them, he measured the voltage across the 1 ohm resistor, giving him a direct measurement of current (thus, the 2A was an empirical measurement).  When he was drawing 2A, the car battery measured at 12V, and the 1 ohm resistor showed 2V across it, so that means he had 14V across the AA batteries (1.167V per battery).  The voltage drop between no load and 2A for the AA's was 1.62V - 1.167V = 0.453 V.  R = V/I = 0.453/2 = 0.2265 ohms per AA battery.  12 batteries in series = 0.2265 * 12 = 2.72 ohms  Add the 1 ohm resistor, and the total resistance is approximately 3.7 ohms.  The car battery's internal resistance is estimated around 10 mOhms, so it's negligible.  This matches up, as the voltage drop you would expect with a total circuit resistance of 3.7 ohms is V = I*R = 2 * 3.7 = 7.4 V, which is the exact difference between the no-load voltage of 19.4 V and the 12V (@ 2A)seen at the car battery.  So without the resistor, the total circuit resistance would have been approximately 2.7 ohms, leading to:  I = V/R ~ 7.4/2.7 = 2.74 A.  (The above equation makes the assumption that the voltage drop at the battery would still be around 7.4V.)  So that means the addition of the 1 ohm resistor dropped the current by about 750 mA.  Assuming I didn't make any major errors above, my question stands as to whether or not this had any value other than for the test points."
electronics,3afbhy,OwlPenn,4,Fri Jun 19 20:22:55 2015 UTC,The internal resistance of AA batteries is greater than 1 ohm under heavy loads like this -- and that resistance increases over time.  This is why you see the current drop over time.
electronics,3afbhy,FullFrontalNoodly,3,Fri Jun 19 22:37:54 2015 UTC,"Thank you, but my question was whether the 1 ohm resistor he added was necessary for the purposes of dropping the current.  If you didn't care about having convenient test points to measure the current, would you still need the 1 ohm resistor?"
electronics,3afbhy,Seelander,5,Fri Jun 19 22:54:48 2015 UTC,The 1 ohm resistor serves no function other than as a shunt for current measurement.  The internal resistance of the AA batteries is at least a full order of magnitude greater.  The shunt resistor is also completely unnecessary for measurement as most meters have a 10A shunt internally.  Even the 20 gauge wire in most test leads can handle 2 amps.
electronics,3afbhy,meuzobuga,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:10:32 2015 UTC,"Good point regarding the measurement, although it's still advantageous as your multimeter isn't locked in to the single measurement.  You can monitor multiple parts of the circuit at will.  On the other point, however, the internal resistance of the AA batteries is approximately 2.7 ohms (see calculations in my post).  That makes the 1 ohm resistor 37% of the AA resistance, which I wouldn't think is negligible."
electronics,3afbhy,OwlPenn,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:34:03 2015 UTC,"The difference is negligible in terms of the operation of the circuit, aside from wasting 37% of your power as heat."

I'm not sure what you mean by ""absorbed"" though -- you can have up to 120V across the battery terminals in a load dump situation. I'm pretty sure the battery won't clamp the voltage to 16V. After all, the battery is also ""in parallel"" with the radio, the ECU and any other electronics powered off the battery and if the battery clamped this voltage you wouldn't be worrying about it in the first place."
electronics,3afbhy,akohlsmith,-2,Sat Jun 20 00:07:25 2015 UTC,"if u flash put 120v across a 12v battery it will absorb it. like the battery is being charged.  to get a load dump a bunch of current would have to go into the battery(like if it was totally dead and not at float voltage) and then it would be disconnected. how often does that happen?  but for the sake of argument lets say the battery is really low. well then so is the capacitor bank. they are in parallel after all. so if u do disconnect a low battery and get a load dump, the caps will receive that electricity and clamp it down exceptionally hard. a large cap at a voltage below that of the line is essentially a short.  capiche?"
electronics,3afbhy,TheSov,2,Sat Jun 20 00:41:30 2015 UTC,"The battery won't clamp the voltage.  A simple way of looking at clamping is this: The clamping component will change it's resistance as voltage increases, thus causing more current flow through the clamping component and limiting the voltage spike.  A capacitor might clamp the spike, a battery won't.  Everything in parallel with the battery will see the 120V spike, unless there's a clamping component in parallel.  I'm not sure how it works with automotive applications, but usually this is accomplished using MOVs or transient suppression diodes."
electronics,3afbhy,akohlsmith,-1,Sat Jun 20 01:30:57 2015 UTC,Non the less. The point is made. In the case where u can have a load dump the caps will handle it.
electronics,3afbhy,TheSov,2,Sat Jun 20 01:36:23 2015 UTC,"No. Batteries don't work that way, and a load dump isn't worse when a battery is low.  If you take 120VAC, rectify it and place it across a lead-acid car battery you will not read 14.7V across the battery terminals. Why do you think this is the case?  Load dumps are very real and there is a reason automotive electronics are built to withstand brief 10x overvoltage conditions.   Think about it: if the battery magically ""absorbed"" the overvoltage then why would we even worry about load dumps?"
electronics,3afbhy,akohlsmith,0,Sat Jun 20 03:53:40 2015 UTC,"Yes it would because that's the only component in the car that would take significant amperage for any real amount of time other than a starter. Listen very closely u noob. The esr of a lead acid battery is low....

electronics,3afbhy,FullFrontalNoodly,3,Sat Jun 20 14:32:15 2015 UTC,"Listen, I've been online long enough that your asinine internet tough guy attitude doesn't impress me. Your use of idiotic 'u' bullshit tells me that you're likely just another pizza faced 13 year old who thinks he can bully people online into conceding. If you can't have a civil conversation then you can kindly fuck off back to 4chan and act like an idiot with the other /b/tards.  Twenty years of electronics design experience tells me that no, if you put a 120V spike across a 12V battery the battery will not magically clamp the voltage to the battery's nominal voltage. Yes, you'll get a high current as the low impedance of the battery attempts to drop this voltage but that's not the entire picture. We're not talking about taking a single car battery and connecting it to a 16 or 18 or even 24VDC bench supply. We're talking about testing that you can get reliable clamping effect with practically any 12V battery with many feet of cabling and high(ish) frequency noise spikes ranging from 40 to 400ms and over a wide temperature range and over many years or component aging. And this says nothing to how the specs of the cap bank will change over time and temperature.  If you take a 10mOhm resistor and put 12V across it what do you measure? At DC the answer is easy, but we're not talking about DC at all here. With an AC (transient) analysis the answer is that it will depend on the transient, source impedance and the impedance of the wiring between the resistor and the source. At transient frequencies the inductance of the wires and the impedance of the battery cannot be ignored and this is precisely why a load dump scenario must be accommodated in automotive electronics. The TI application note I linked earlier mentions a 40-400ms typical duration and the resistance can be as high as 4 ohms, although I wasn't able to see whether they're talking about system resistance or impedance of the battery under transient conditions.   My entire point was that putting 58F of capacitance with a maximum rated voltage of 16V across a noisy, inductive 13.8V (nominal) system is not a very safe design. Hell, even putting a 16V rated component in a relatively quiet 12V nominal system isn't good design practise. If it's wired directly (and I mean directly) to the battery there is a slightly higher margin of safety as the battery will be the dominant sink as you've already mentioned. It won't do this instantaneously, though, and depending on how serious the manufacturer is about that 16V rail you could end up damaging the bank. If you end up wiring this thing to the alternator side of the system you will damage the capacitor bank, and it's been my experience that large capacitors can fail shorted. Without fusing you're potentially looking at a very lively situation under the hood.  ""nah just throw it in, it'll work bruh"" doesn't cut it where I come from. You're not trying to drive a 12V lamp with a 555 and 2N2222 here."
electronics,3afbhy,shapul,-1,Sat Jun 20 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"do u sit there and listen to yourself? i mean seriously. industrial use super caps arent going to have an issue in your car. the fact you are seriously attempting to have this conversation. do you know what desulfation is? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead%E2%80%93acid_battery#Sulfation_and_desulfation  its when you pass high voltage/current pulses into a lead acid battery to remove the sulfur plating that occurs as a result of use.  your load dump scenario is only KNOWN to happen when the battery is removed.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_dump   In automotive electronics, it refers to the disconnection of the vehicle battery from the alternator while the battery is being charged.    you know why?    It is typically clamped to 40 V in 12 V vehicles and about 60 V in 24 V systems.   there is protection circuitry in the car...  add on to that the 60 F of caps and it WILL clamp that sucker.  there is no known problem to do this, people already do this  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPJao1xLe7w  20 years on the job and you are a terrible engineer, wow."
electronics,3afbhy,TheSov,3,Sat Jun 20 18:33:50 2015 UTC,"Desulfation has nothing to do with ""clamping the voltage."" It's a technique used to remove the sulfur buildup, as the linked wiki article states. I'm not sure why you bring this up as it has nothing to do with my statement that the battery is not guaranteed to clamp the voltage to a consistent and safe level for the capacitors linked in the OP's comment.  Load dumps aren't ""prevented"" by the battery being in circuit. They occur when the battery is disconnected and the high magnetic field in the alternator coils takes a finite amount of time to collapse, resulting in a voltage spike on the 12V rail. The battery isn't protecting the system from load dumps, the nature of disconnecting high current loads from an alternator with a lot of inductance and a slow/cheap regulation is what causes it. A/C compressors using electric motors can cause it, as can other high current loads on the system when they're switched off.  I'd already stated that I did not look at the datasheet for the specific capacitor, I only noted that the rated voltage was not very far away from the typical operating point of a car's 12V system and that you might want to take a closer look at things before saying ""yeah man, just throw this in.""  Now after actually reading the data sheet this is neither appropriate nor industrial, so it would appear that you've not read it either. 65C maximum operating temp isn't good enough for beside the battery in most cars. It's also got an (initial) ESR that is very, very close to that of the battery, so you've got to worry about how it will react to engine cranking since it's just as capable of dumping its energy as the battery and its maximum current draw rating is 170A (although again the test current for measuring that 25mOhm ESR is only 35A). Its absolute maximum voltage is only 17V, one shot, not to exceed 1 second. It's difficult to say how multiple repeated hits above this voltage would affect it, but that's again why I said that it's not as simple as throwing this across the battery and calling it a day.  You claim it'd never see voltage above the battery voltage but its other specifications indicate that you might have other issues with it.  I'd wager that this device will have very little effect on preventing your needing a boost at all. It's a tiny battery which might help a weakish car battery get the starter coil charged, but after designing a proper circuit with this you'd probably be better off just replacing the weak battery anyway.  I'm done."
electronics,3afbhy,shapul,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:55:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think that either of you understand what is going on here.  A load dump is no different than the flyback on any other coil.  As long as there is somewhere for current to flow (be it the battery or the capacitor) the voltage will never rise to begin with.  When the capacitor is at zero charge it is at the optimum condition to be able to handle a load dump.  Where you need to be concerned is when the capacitor is near full charge -- remember your capacitor charging curves!  However, I believe that a 16V supercap charged to 14V should still be able to handle a battery disconnect.  (Though you should still do the math before actually trying this!)"
electronics,3afbhy,base736,1 point,Sat Jun 20 01:44:10 2015 UTC,"hmmm, how do you exactly add a supercap to a battery?  Edit: never mind. I found this. Basically you just put the supercap in parallel to the battery. Now the supercap provides large current bursts when needed."

Get yourself some of these in the right size and some through hole 5mm RGB LEDs and PWM the three channels to that warm white/yellow OR somehow find warm/yellow white single color LEDs. Which I don't think you'll find. The RGB values would probably be somewhere around R 255 G 250 B 125, or #FFFA7D. With your raspberrypi, you could run a single shift register like the TLC5940 to control the color and intensity on all three, as well as 7 more channels (the TLC is a 16 channel constant current driver). Using LEDs would also give you the added bonus of setting the non-active LEDs to 20% brightness instead of going fully off, which would also be more in line with the game's model. Check out this page for a raspberrypi TLC5940 driver and documentation.  And we need to know what diameter the base of the switch/lens needs to be. I found some really nice ones that are 0.81"" diameter. And another that's 9/16"".  Oh, 6mm. That's a weird size. Sorry, I looked and couldn't find any round, red lenses close enough to 6mm. Maybe you could open up the hole in the faceplate a little to accommodate the 9/16"" lens? That might be a little big though. That's all the advice I've got though, so good luck.  EDIT: Ok, I lied. I kept looking. I found two contenders on mouser:  Option 1: Not waterproof, ""amber"" (slightly more orange than red), 7.8mm diameter threat mount, designed to accommodate 5mm LEDs, $1.09 each  Link, Datasheet  Option 2: Same model but in red and includes a waterproofing seal, $1.99 each  Link, Datasheet  THAT is what I would do, OP."

Thank you so much!  6mm is my rough measurement as I seem to have misplaced my measuring tape in the move to my new place. Looking again today (and using an adjustable online ruler Sorry ) it's looking more like 8mm..... I'm going to get a measuring tape and give you the exact dimension of the holes.   Thank you so much though. I seriously LOVE your idea.  The only thing is, the lights in game as I understand are buttons. The character just never puts their hand on the PipBoy at all when using it. The dial is used, but the hand is never there for example. The 5 point switch is for switching between the 5 sub menus within the 3 main menus.   But I may end up just adding buttons somewhere else because the switch hunt is getting ridiculous.   I'll let you know in a couple of hours!"

If you want to prove that, you would need to document the actual energy produced by the cell in the different applications. That is, you would need to measure the actual voltage and current produced by the battery and the ""joule thief"" device.  When you use terms like ""20-36mA"" and ""not as bright, but you could read a book"", that isn't scientific, and the resulting data is not useful."

electronics,3af1h0,1wiseguy,-1,Sat Jun 20 17:18:49 2015 UTC,"Your brain only processes images at a given speed - persistence of vision, even a single pulse will register quite a lot of detail.  Near your upper limit, yes, acuity suffers.. but if you're well above 100Hz or so, your brain cannot tell the difference.   An interesting take on the idea, involving TVs - higher refresh rates can actually make some types of film worse http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2379206,00.asp  From TFA:  ""As a general rule, if what you're watching involves seeing real peoples' faces as they talk, disable the higher refresh rate so they don't look like creepy dolls (also known as the ""soap opera effect""). If what you're watching involves seeing real people run into each other (sports), or fake people attacking each other in an artificial environment (video games), keep the higher refresh rate mode turned on (though set to ""low"" or ""medium"" if given the option, because the most zealous motion modes can still make the picture look unreal.   Remember these modes don't add any actual detail to the video, and you might want to disable them when watching every-day, non-action content. A 120Hz refresh rate can be beneficial for certain situations, but a higher refresh rate should not be considered a good reasons to spend more on an HDTV. For most television and movie watching, you'll probably want to keep the refresh rate set to 60Hz, anyway. Just keep the benefits in mind for sports and games, and don't feel the need to push past 120Hz. Anything higher really is more of a gimmick than a truly useful feature. """
electronics,3af1h0,OverVolt,3,Sat Jun 20 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"OK, so you're not claiming that your device is extracting more energy from the cell; you're saying that the PWM drive method produces visible light with less energy than DC operation.   So if you drive one LED at 20 mA DC, and another one at some duty cycle and frequency, you can see just as good with the light from that second LED, at a lower average current.  Is that it?"
electronics,3af1h0,PointyOintment,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:10:53 2015 UTC,"The first week is actually VERY much brighter on the thief.. as the voltage spike is very high (upwards of 6V), but so short that the LED doesn't overheat.  It actually hurts your eye to look at it.  So the amount of usable light (from the human eye perspective) is actually much more than the continuous steady current burn.   It's like we've been using LEDs all wrong all this time."
electronics,3af1h0,PointyOintment,3,Fri Jun 19 18:24:11 2015 UTC,"If this is true, it would be a good thing to document.  You should set up an experiment where you get several different people to evaluate DC and pulsed LED light sources, and get them to adjust the two sources to what they believe are comparable levels, and see what results you get.  For example, you could have the subjects adjust the light sources to provide a minimum reasonable illumination for reading a book. After many trials, you should be able to confirm what you're saying.  I have to admit, I have never heard of this effect. DC and PWM drive are both common with LEDs, and nobody has ever suggested an advantage from the PWM method."
electronics,3af1h0,prairieg,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:34:59 2015 UTC,"Good ideas. I suggest making only one of the compared LEDs adjustable. That way it's easier to match them because you only have one knob to turn, and you eliminate any subconscious effort to match the knobs' positions rather than the LEDs' brightnesses.

That way your user gets a nice clean GPIO output, instead of having to do all the filtering and calibration mess themselves.    Are there disks of PCB sold for electrode usage?   Yes, most PCB manufacturers will route your board outline to whatever shape you like, with some breakaway tabs to hold the boards together during assembly. I don't know what you mean by ""electrode usage"", I have seen regular FR4 work find before.

LED should light for a few seconds when you wave your hand in front. Turn one clockwise half way. Wave hand again. if LED stays on for longer than before, you've found on-time control. If not, turn the other half way clockwise and LED should stay on longer. The other control adjusts sensitivity, where clockwise is higher sensitivity (can detect someone from farther away).  Docs say that on-time can be up in the 5-minute range. I verified that this timer is reset each time movement is detected, so if someone keeps moving the light will never go off until they stop moving for the on-time delay. This seems exactly what you want.  Oh, and the output line is active-high.

Of course, the big flaw in the US legal system is that it does not have ""loser pays"" though that is being introduced in patent cases.

You can't even challenge the patent unless you have financial backers willing to support you.  And unlike in most countries, if you are found innocent you are not reimbursed for your losses. You have to pursue a counterclaim on the other party, and that can takes months more of legal work. Then the company who is being challenged can drag it out for years, or just continue to re-challenge the verdict in another court. A lot of verdicts never get paid because of the ability to drag things out. Big companies can afford that, small people can't.   Pretty much the rule is that the person with the most money is the automatic winner. If a big company presses any silly suit against you, it is wise to give up.

electronics,3a9c9w,FullFrontalNoodly,3,Thu Jun 18 16:24:07 2015 UTC,"Take a look at the lifetime report on the stock price.  It saw an insane jump in 2012 with all the hype over 3D printing going on at the time.  Most of the stock decline is as a result of 3D printing never really living up to the hype.  You can see similar trends among other 3D printing companies.  But I agree, the Makerbot issue has severely hurt Stratasys and they are going to have marketing troubles even if they can manage to develop a low-end product that doesn't suck."
electronics,3a9c9w,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Thu Jun 18 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"I think most of the crash was caused by having Stratasys  buy Makerbot for 403 million dollars, which to Stratasys  was a lot of money (about 1/3 of their real value), and they were betting it would be a race horse that would float the company, but now they have found out it is a boat anchor. And the stockholders found out, and it collapsed. Now they own a liability.  The rise in 2013 and 2014 was probably due to hype, and not real growth of profits.   So now they are back where they started, but they own a shiny new boat anchor that will keep their operating capital tied up, and drag their profits down. Boat anchors require expensive maintenance.  The stock slope is still down. We'll have to see what happens in the next few months. Their real value (value of their assets) should be about right where they are now (which is why Oppenheimer predicts leveling), but the future stock price is going to depend on what liabilities they have acquired and that profits they can manage to keep it floating. I think at this point liabilities might exceed assets and income, meaning a further slide.  Right now, I'd call the place a severely leaking boat."
electronics,3a9c9w,FullFrontalNoodly,3,Thu Jun 18 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"As I recall the entire purchase was a stock swap.  The deal was only worth 400 million at the inflated stock price.  The ""real"" price was far, far less than that.  But I do agree that no matter how you look at it Stratasys made a huge mistake in the way they handled their purchase of Makerbot.  Or more correctly, the real problem was the way that Bre Pettis re-structured Makerbot so that it could be purchased.  Anyone with a clue realized that the company wasn't worth anything at all at that point."
electronics,3a9c9w,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Thu Jun 18 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"That's why I worry about the future of Stratasys, no matter what Oppenheimer says. Poor management (stupid management) drove it this direction, and they are still there."
electronics,3a9c9w,FullFrontalNoodly,4,Thu Jun 18 20:48:38 2015 UTC,The problem is that both you are Oppenheimer are looking at Stratasys as if they were a company that started in 2012.  Stratasys has been around since the early 90s and their core industrial business is solid.  The only people who got screwed were the ones who paid more than $30/share for the stock because that has been its real value for the past decade now.
electronics,3a9c9w,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu Jun 18 21:06:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, that core is the real value. It might settle there, as Oppenheimer predicts. You and Oppenheimer agree on that.

Financial reports should reveal more about the financial health later."

Adafruit still open sources the vast majority of their code and CAD files and puts them right up on GitHub, even for their newest products. They can't open source every chip they use or every submodule they build upon, but they do their best.  Yes, Makerbot is scummy as hell, but they're also a very well-recognized brand-name. It's like going to a smartphone store and expecting them to not carry Apple, Samsung, or LG - it'd be economic suicide for the store."

Pay no attention, even the staff writers joke about this constantly.  Sadly, there's no good solution in sight.  Limor embodies the perfect balance between business and community.  I would say 'IMO', but there's a lot of consensus on this on the 'internets'.  There are complaints about them selling ""MakerBot crap"", which is only partially true.  Right after they got a whiff of the rotten smell at MakerBot they started favoring Printrbot as their goto 3d printer...  I could rebut every single point on that thread, but who has time to do so these days."
electronics,3a9c9w,x1sc0,9,Thu Jun 18 15:56:38 2015 UTC,"I think people are rightly angry with makerbot politics and recent quality, and Limor is only being attacked because she is in the line of fire. Adafruit is a vendor of pretty much anything they think will have profits and low returns. That's how a legitimate business is run.  From what I was reading though, makerbot recent releases don't fall under the category of ""low returns"", so Adafruit might have to recalculate the profit margin on that. It's purely a business decision."
electronics,3a9c9w,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Thu Jun 18 17:44:55 2015 UTC,"Agreed.    There's so much drama going on right now in our little niche of the tech world! It's soooo annoying as I thought these things were exclusive to mainstream markets... Boy, was I wrong.  Your comment reminded me to Sparkfun's position on the whole Arduino vs. Arduino issue, where they clearly said they'll always look after the customer's best interest, which of course is a nice way of saying what you just stated---purely a business decision.  I like how Adafruit has been able to grow their business greatly without screwing over their community, a trait that seems to getting rarer in this corner of the market."

Tons of rabid Apple fans boycott Android (""they sell your data to advertisers, ecosystem integration sucks, it doesn't Just Work!!"").   And yet, people still buy Android and Apple, despite these boycotts. Some people may boycott Makerbot, but I know tons of institutions and businesses buying Makerbot because it's a big brand name. Not carrying it as one of most recognized names in the scene is stupid business practice. Again, it'd be like a smartphone store not carrying Apple, LG, or Samsung because some OPO fanboys think those companies have ""sold out."" OPO fanboys don't even make up double-digit percentages of the market.   I personally dislike Makerbot and would never buy any of their products, but if I was running a business, I'd have to think about it more evenly than that."

They have some positive things to say about the wreckage...   In addition, the Oppenheimer report said, ""Bre Pettis, co-founder of MakerBot, left Stratasys with the spin-off of his incubator. Most execs have left, the workforce has been cut, and stores closed. Whether the new structure is right for MakerBot or not is unclear, but at minimum it has been streamlined.""   With the stores closed, the income lost, and the continued overhead of running the remains of the Makerbot carcass, I think Oppenheimer is being optimistic. Sales in other divisions might be able to carry the load of the Makerbot loss.  There is a possibility the company might survive, but it looks bleak. this has been a terrible financial fiasco for the company."

There was an insane disconnect between what low-end printers could do and what everyone was claiming they would be able to do in a few years.  When people started to realize just how slow and finicky they really were in addition to producing relatively low-quality parts the market simply went through a correction.

Makerbot's printers are a perfect example of this."

Their designs are made and assembled by professionals making a living wage in North America. Of course it's cheaper to buy elsewhere: slave wages and outsourcing drive down costs. This is also why wages have stagnated for everyone for the past thirty years.  I mean, don't get me wrong: I love places like Seeedstudio, but I have to wonder with all their stuff being made in Shenzhen if I'm not contributing to the situation that made those Foxconn employees threaten mass suicide."
electronics,3a9c9w,mr_machine,8,Thu Jun 18 16:17:56 2015 UTC,"When it comes to stuff Adafruit actually designs and manufactures in the US, I agree with you... but that represents only a portion of what they vend.  A meter of 30 RGB LEDs from Adafruit is about $17; you can get the same stuff on eBay for about $10. Clearly, Adafruit isn't manufacturing those LED strips in New York; they're Chinese imports, just like everyone else's. I wouldn't mind a buck or two per unit to pay for tutorials, but they're charging almost twice as much as they should be."

electronics,3a9c9w,stahlous,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:08:30 2015 UTC,"I guess. I'm not trying to represent the ""average buyer,"" just offering my opinion.  If you're buying a few parts for noodling, and you're kind of a beginner, and you're impatient, I'd say Adafruit may be the absolute best company to buy from. Their QC isn't perfect, but it's as good as anyone's and better than some. Their documentation is fantastic. And their shipping is fast-ish.  But when you need, for example, many tens of meters of RGB LEDs, Adafruit is a crummy place to go. The markup really builds up, and the quantity discounts offered don't do much to offset it. If you're buying that much, you probably don't need their tutorials so much, and hopefully you've planned a project on that scale well enough to absorb the wait of overseas shipping.  Adafruit isn't the best place for nerds to buy stuff period. It's the best place under certain circumstances, and not so much under others.  That's all I'm saying."

I know much more about linux, since I watched it grow up and have used it extensively since 1999.  Two of the remaining big players in the linux game are Redhat and IBM. They are both heavy contributors to the development and testing of linux releases. Other companies that tried aggressive legal tactics went bankrupt or lost their ass and got out. This is because the people who run servers know who is for linux, and who is a linux parasite. They determine what the corporations will buy, so the market is driven by grass roots users even to the corporate level.  My son is getting into this maker stuff, and he told me not too long ago ""Makerbot is dead."". Until I read this hackaday commentary, I wasn't sure why he had that opinion."

It's a microscope and set of whiskers or needles that allow you to make contact with microscale landing pads.  But for your next mask design, and if space permits, run the contacts out to a larger contacts, perhaps ones that continue on past your original set of contacts.  You can make it so that you can dice or cleave off the larger contact pads, if needbe.  Or, if you have a deeper etch step, build in a trench to pre-form a cleave line.

I am a member of the local hackspace which give me access to small quantities of spare parts as well.  Also I am not counting borrowed equipment like the workshop to build the case (thanks Dad).  What I am trying to say is it is very hard to estimate what another person's cost would be.  The biggest cost by far was the PCBs which were $1100 with tax and shipping included.  However I have leftovers which I am hoping to sell  (Tindie Link).  Most electronic parts were sourced from eBay/China for cheap, I spent about $500.

electronics,3a4sng,zdelarosa00,2,Wed Jun 17 12:12:00 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool.  I just glossed over http://mycpu.selfhost.it/epj03.htm quick and am wondering why someone would use EEPROM in the ALU?  The author cites it as the reason why the CPU is limited to 8MHz but doesn't seem to go into why you would use EEPROM in the ALU.   I can't think of any advantage but I can think of a lot of disadvantages.  Especially in the ALU where the cells are being constantly rewritten.  EEPROM is usually only good for 100k - 1 million Erase/Write cycles and is slow.
electronics,3a4sng,cadika_orade,4,Wed Jun 17 12:33:11 2015 UTC,It doesn't really explain but it could well be that he is not bothering to do the logic in the ALU and just using the ROM as a massive lookup table where the operands and the operation form the address bits and the result comes out of the data bits.  He also uses a ROM to microcode the CPU meaning the ROM is used to lookup which logic elements should be operated.
electronics,3a4sng,EkriirkE,4,Wed Jun 17 19:39:25 2015 UTC,Found it:   The core logic would reside in a re-programmable EPROM. And because EPROM's are so universal I also constructed the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) with some big EPROM's that are simply used as lookup-tables. Thus an 8x8-bit multiplication can be done within only one clock cycle.   That makes 0 sense though when there are 74 series 8 bit ALU IC's available that can do the computation in a fraction of the time it takes to read from EEPROM.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/74181  For an openCPU it's also impossible to find the Instruction Set.  I found this on a different site that looks similar: http://hercules.uni-mb.si/projects/LogicPC/OP-koda.pdf   8-bit Multiplication takes 6-16 cycles.  8-bit Addition takes 4-6 cycles.   Even 8-bit AND takes 4-6 cycles.    I'm just not seeing the advantage of an EEPROM lookup table here.   EDIT:  Who downvotes?  I'm providing sources and everything and have a valid question.  Does this really add nothing to this discussion?
electronics,3a4sng,cadika_orade,2,Wed Jun 17 20:57:14 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote, but I'd assume it's because of this:   That makes 0 sense though   This guy didn't embark on this project because it made sense to do. He did it to learn or to have fun. And for that purpose, he was artificially limiting himself to ""simple"" chips. A single-chip ALU is probably too ""fancy"" for this project."
electronics,3a4sng,1osb,2,Wed Jun 17 22:57:06 2015 UTC,Are you sure that chip is actually available though? A lot of the more esoteric 74-series parts can't be found at any reputable distributors anymore.
electronics,3a4sng,jaifriedpork,2,Wed Jun 17 23:43:51 2015 UTC,"The 74181 and 74381 and similar chips do not have, for example, multiplication.  Only add, subtract, XOR, OR, AND and shifts.  Further, they are 4 bits wide, so to operate on 16 or 20 bit values such as addresses would require either a microprogram iterating the 16 bit value through 4 bits at a time, or a wide datapath with 4 chips, plus carry-lookahead, plus decoding logic the functions, etc.  An EEPROM, as a programmable logic device, can do all of this in one chip."
electronics,3a4sng,1osb,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:18:19 2015 UTC,"I found this document explaining the use of an EPROM for an 8-bit ALU, it refers to the MyCPU for a real life example.  Basically it gives you the flexibility of a lookup table, you can set up almost any function you want without going in to complex logic design (within reason).  This lookup table approach is implemented on-die on modern CPUs I heard (could be wrong on that).   The cells are only written once, during setting up this lookup table.

Add I see it, an FPGA would be functionality equivalent to building it in Logisim, since the work is primarily programmatic, and to my mind it's a different project than building the computer out of SMD or through-hole logic, or out of discrete transistors if you're particularly masochistic.  To put it another way, I would (eventually will be, in fact) build a computer from discrete logic if I wanted to be hands-on in the construction from top to bottom. I would use an FPGA if I wanted to be hands-on with the design, wasn't much interested in the physical construction, but did want to have a working model. The materials, to some extent, dictate what you get out of the project."

electronics,3a4sng,StripTheFlesh,2,Wed Jun 17 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"Obviously the point here is to build a computer out of physical, discrete components you can handle, each of which you understand individually, and which together produce the emergent behaviour of computation.  There's a bit of magic in that, surely.  Using a FPGA doesn't have that; it's just programming.  You never get to see the physical components come together - that was already done by Altera at the foundry.  (As for SMD components, they can be hard to solder at home.  We don't all have rock-steady hands and 20/12 vision.)"

electronics,3a6f80,elliuotatar,7,Wed Jun 17 16:22:20 2015 UTC,I totally agree. Digi-Key is the gold standard.  So why by from Mouser? Do they have better prices?
electronics,3a6f80,1wiseguy,3,Wed Jun 17 16:30:32 2015 UTC,"I thought I'd search there to see if there were some chips I missed.    But yes, they do often have better prices.  For example a level shifter there I was looking at was ten cents cheaper, which adds up if you're buying a hundred or so.  Of course, since they also don't have as large a selection as Digikey the price advantage often goes away once you account for the additional shipping you'd have to pay to order from both sources.  So really unless you're gonna be ordering 1000 of something the price advantage isn't worth it.  And if you're gonna be ordering 1000 then usually the price difference between Digikey and Mouser isn't so great and you could find the most expensive parts cheaper on a site like Verical.  Oh, and another thing that sucks about their search and it's been this way for YEARS - You can't actually sort by how many they have in stock.  They only offer an ""availability"" parameter which does fuck all good when they don't tell you what that means or you need the parts now not in six to ten weeks."
electronics,3a6f80,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Wed Jun 17 16:40:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you are talking about -- Mouser's search engine was hugely improved a year or two back, largely to make it a lot more like Digi-key's.  Nonetheless, it is still nowhere near as good as Digi-key's search engine.  You can find hundreds of references which tell you to use Digi-key's search engine to select your parts, and then octopart/findchips to determine where you can purchase them cheapest."

HOWEVER, i'd open up the amp and rewire the outlet properly, before you die... or kill someone by mistake.  Simply take the back off the amp, and replace the current socket with this, then solder and heatshrink. Then you're able to pretty much use any cable (from a PC, kettle etc) to plug it in.  EDIT: assuming you have a kettle/pc plug lying around, rewiring the amp with a male socket will cost you less than having to make that death plug."

electronics,3a7eus,henry82,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"I had a long think about your problem. Here are some options.    Buy something like this for $30 on amazon, and throw out that sketchy adapter. The only think i'm not 100% sure about is the required wattage your amp takes. Your current adapter takes 200W max, and this is 500W max, so it should be fine, hence i'd want to double check. this one looks larger, but better quality. You could mount it inside or outside the amp, depending on how much cable you wanted. Drill through the black sockets (on pic 8), then cut the plug of your 220v amp off, push the wires through, solder and heatshrink. Place a cable tie on the wire so it can't be pulled back through. (should be done in combo with either 3 or 4) Drill a hole in your amp wall, mount something flush like this. The ground wire should be attached to an external bolt on the transformer. Drill through the black sockets (on pic 8), then cut the female end of a 110v extenstion cord off, push the wires through, solder and heatshrink. Place a cable tie on the wire so it can't be pulled back through.    Make sure you double check with others. These are my ideas to make it less dangerous (hopefully), but yeah, im not an electrician.

Many people daisy chain them. the problem is when someone hangs them up backwards, so they plan to use these ""double male"" cables instead if rehanging them. It's super dangerous as you've got a live male plug exposed. - easy to kill someone  The other... semi legitimate use is if you want to run a house circuit off a generator when the house power cuts out. You remove the external fuse (so no power at all can run into the house), then plug the gen into a power socket. I've heard there are issues with this too, something to do with neutral line and back feed. Ideally, if you want a backup generator, you should get an electrcian to install the male electrical plug and one of those massive ""Frankenstein"" switches."
electronics,3a7eus,MATlad,2,Thu Jun 18 12:29:12 2015 UTC,"'Uses' have already been addressed, so the big problem with suicide cords like this is that due to the male plug, if you're not careful, you can end up with situations where you have a mains-powered arc welder or cattle prod.  All it takes is a moment of inattentivenes or someone who doesn't know what's going on, or someone tripping over the cord, and so on and so on.

electronics,3a7g2a,1wiseguy,2,Wed Jun 17 21:28:36 2015 UTC,"You could certainly use an AVR and a dedicated BLE part if you wanted to maintain software compatibility with the Arduino libraries, and I'm fairly certain you could meet the size requirements at the same time if you used parts that were small enough.  Personally, I too would choose an MCU with embedded BLE, but then again I am not terribly fond of the Arduino ecosystem to begin with."
electronics,3a7g2a,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Wed Jun 17 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks everyone. You are right: I've been able to find duino + BLE boards; but nothing with an accelerometer (except the Punchthrough Bean listed by /u/bobbaddeley below, which I had not heard about). Just in case anyone else is interested, here are some examples: BLE Mini: http://redbearlab.com/blemini/ Coin's Arduino BLE: https://github.com/CoinApps/arduino-ble-dev-kit/wiki BLEduino: http://bleduino.cc/start/intro/ TinyDuino: https://tiny-circuits.com/products/tiny-duino.html (but once you add the BLE and accel, it becomes pretty big :( )    The Bean sounds like just the ticket!"
electronics,3a7g2a,ctz99,1 point,Thu Jun 18 17:23:26 2015 UTC,Aren't the 'arduino-compatible' headers about two inches apart? Perhpas you mean a different thing by arduino compatible.  I'd suggest you look at the TI sensortags (the old one is 8051-based; the new one is ARM-based). Both have onboard accelerometer/gyro/compass and expose the raw and fused data over the standard GATT profiles.

electronics,3a6hkh,TurnbullFL,-1,Wed Jun 17 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"The battery is less than a year old, the current draw was more and I don't know what the starting charge was, and the battery was stored over the winter on a battery tender in a heated garage.  So either the battery is faulty, or damaged?"
electronics,3a6hkh,TurnbullFL,2,Wed Jun 17 18:26:00 2015 UTC,"I've had 2 DRS, one thing I learned is to keep a battery tender on it if going to sit over a week.     The batteries are small to keep weight down, and that makes for short battery life."

electronics,3a6hkh,bradn,2,Wed Jun 17 18:38:54 2015 UTC,You will need to size the switch to handle the bike's starting current
electronics,3a6hkh,feefnarg,2,Wed Jun 17 19:42:05 2015 UTC,Or put the switch after the starter but before any electricals that may have parasitic drain.

electronics,3a6hkh,kaluce,4,Wed Jun 17 19:45:40 2015 UTC,.37mA is not very much. Maybe it's just an imprecise Multimeter. In practice I wouldn't worry about it. In cars I've measured the electronics to have a standby consumption on the order of 100mA.  I would worry about the state of your battery though. A 12V lead acid battery that was discharged to 5V has almost certainly been damaged by it and might have to be replaced.
electronics,3a6hkh,kaluce,2,Wed Jun 17 17:30:08 2015 UTC,"It might be an imprecise multimeter, cost me about $40.  Also, I just ""sorta"" tested the battery. Turned it on, but didn't start the engine (gas tank is off anyways).   With the speedo, rear light, low beam and high beam on, it held 11.46V, down from 12.52V for at least 5min before I gave up. Didn't get a current reading though, need to find my other DMM.  Not great at all, but it wasn't anywhere near fully charged. I'm going to disconnect the tender before I go to bed tonight, to give the battery time to settle, and then I will test it again tomorrow morning.  If it doesn't work out, then I'll buy a new battery, maybe go LiFePO4 this time. I don't think the battery is horribly damaged though."
electronics,3a6hkh,TurnbullFL,3,Wed Jun 17 17:53:43 2015 UTC,"The current draw you are mentioning in the milliamps is nothing. Like TurnBullFL mentions, this is no serious load on that big battery.  So one possibility is that it is a bad battery.   But I wonder if there is a sneak thief here... a device that is sporadically hogging current while you aren't measuring."
electronics,3a6hkh,imMute,2,Wed Jun 17 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"The battery is 6.5Ah, TurnBullFL was talking about the DR with his 20Ah quip, not the DRZ.  Over 7 weeks, the 2.26mA draw from the speedo would have eaten up 2.65Ah.  Also, I worked on the bike, installing and testing electricals for the first few weeks of that break, didn't run the engine though. So the battery was never recharged. Total current load from all those electrics is 6.7A, I probably ran them all for 20-40min combined over those weeks.  Then considering that it might not have been fully charged from the beginning.  I think it is just a combination of unfortunate circumstances that it got to where it is now.    But none of it explains where that 370uA draw is coming from."
electronics,3a6hkh,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:47:29 2015 UTC,"I do know that in cars, you do have significant parasitic draw from a lot of junk, like the ECU, TCM, alarm, so on and so forth. If you really want to find out what's pulling the miniscule 370uA, dump all the electrical from the bike one system at a time.   While you're doing this you might encounter a wire with a slightly frayed sheath that made contact with a painted surface, (due to the low current) and is getting the draw from that. That's my guess."
electronics,3a6hkh,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Wed Jun 17 20:07:37 2015 UTC,"That is what I did to find out that the speedo was pulling 2.26mA. After I unplugged it, is when I still have the .37mA. I guess it could be circuitry inside the CDI doing it, as it really is probably one of the only things left which would do that. The bike doesn't have a computer or anything."
electronics,3a6hkh,henry82,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:10:23 2015 UTC,"370uA does sound a bit like passives territory, so it could be something like a bad resistor or cap leaking too."

electronics,3a6hkh,jotux,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"The 0.37mA was at closer to 12V, it was 0.15mA at around 5V. So roughly twice as high in resistance. It's probably a combination of things, dirt, moisture, slightly corroded contacts, etc..."
electronics,3a6hkh,I_Miss_Scrubs,2,Wed Jun 17 20:17:51 2015 UTC,"If that little current causes a problem, and you rest the vehicle for such a long time, then some type of quick disconnect of the positive battery lead sounds like the thing."

electronics,3a04bs,jotux,23,Tue Jun 16 04:36:56 2015 UTC,A few notes (I'm an automotive hardware engineer) -   You need way more transient protection.  I assume the switched 12V is reverse battery protected but you're still subject to load dump (which even if centrally suppressed exceeds your 20V maximum input voltage) and various negative voltage transients. Your 10uF input capacitor won't help much with battery dropout problems where the harness may go to GND for some short period (milliseconds).  Typically a diode is used to prevent this from discharging input capacitors in this condition.  A 100nF 50V capacitor is good measure as ESD protection at the pin. Your switching frequency probably causes EMC failures - be wary of this if you experience weird glitches in your mirror dimming or AM radio.
electronics,3a04bs,RTA5,3,Tue Jun 16 15:35:23 2015 UTC,I am building something else along these lines. Any suggestions how to do this correctly? I was told to use a 20V MOV but haven't looked into it.
electronics,3a04bs,joshu,3,Tue Jun 16 21:14:13 2015 UTC,"All pins have ESD capacitors with voltage rating of at least 50V.  If it's not switched power  put open mode capacitors on battery nodes (you don't want a cap shorting battery when the car is not in use).  You'd also have to worry about quiescent current in that case.  As for the battery input, a 200V+ schottky diode goes to your low power circuits for battery dropout and reverse battery considerations.  Use 40V ICs and have a clamp on the front (anode) of the diode.  Must clamp before 40V, nominal rating probably in the low to mid 30V range.  Double battery (24V) is a condition you dont want to clamp in since its long enough to burn you up.  If reverse battery protection isn't present remember to use a bidirectional TVS."

electronics,3a06ff,beanmosheen,1 point,Tue Jun 16 14:12:32 2015 UTC,"And you can't make one? Seems pretty simple, but I get it"

electronics,3a06ff,beanmosheen,0,Tue Jun 16 14:31:11 2015 UTC,"How would this be 100% safe?  The safest thing I can think of is having a socket on the base and a plug on the lid, so when the lid is off the plug has to be unplugged. But that creates an unsafe possibility of accidentally dropping a wire into the socket (a child proof schuko socket would be quite safe though, if bulky).  More practically you could just have 2 or 3 switches in series (that have to be depressed by the lid) and a LED warning light which is on when the power is on and can be seen through the transparent lid. So even if all your switches somehow get stuck on, the warning light will warn you."
electronics,3a06ff,dizekat,2,Wed Jun 17 06:36:22 2015 UTC,"Look at the photo. See the fuses in the lid? Those are your switch contacts. There is a physical air gap when you lift the lid, and you can see the physical contacts have been removed. All of the line voltage is safely hidden inside of the enclosure at that point. The colored tabs on the front are your quick connects for the device under test. When you close the lid that entire area gets shrouded by the lid. It's made for bench hookups and is very safe for it's intended task. It's not for permanent installations. I use one for all of my motor controller work.   Switches are fine and dandy, but you would have to chain all kinds of crap together, and what happens if your LED burns out?   This is a well established, and tested device."
electronics,3a06ff,beanmosheen,0,Wed Jun 17 13:13:07 2015 UTC,Until you accidentally drop a wire or the like into where your fuses go to make a connection. And if led burns out you see that the next time you use the device (it doesn't lit up when lid is closed).
electronics,3a06ff,dizekat,2,Wed Jun 17 17:44:29 2015 UTC,What makes that different from a wall outlet?  The LED not lighting up is a safety hazard.
electronics,3a06ff,nizon,0,Wed Jun 17 20:26:45 2015 UTC,"What makes that different from a wall outlet?   Uhm, that you are handling wires and small tools over it, and that it's holes-up?   The LED not lighting up is a safety hazard.    You still get no power without the lid engaging the switches. That test thingy, doesn't it have an incandescent bulb that lits up when it's powered? Same purpose.  I'm talking of an arrangement similar to that in a microwave oven. I have one that got 3 interlock switches, two in series and third works through the control board. I'm sure it is a lot safer than your 100% safe. There's probably more risk that for some reason the switches get bypassed by some sort of crazy wire short than that they would get stuck on, anyway.  Anyhow it's probably more convenient to just buy an existing test box, I was more remarking on you saying it's 100% safe. There's other risks in using connectors that aren't present when using switches."

Overcharging or charging too quickly (or doing like OP did and trying to charge backwards, a.k.a. discharging through a constant voltage supply circuit not meant to sink, of all things) is likely to cause the battery to fail catastrophically, generating flammable or toxic gases (as mentioned), or causing the battery to rupture and ignite.   Lithium batteries have specific charge profiles (IIRC, and keep in mind I haven't worked with battery chargers in a long time, it's something like trickle current when almost empty, constant current, constant voltage trickle when almost full). That's safe, and nothing at all like plugging a constant voltage supply onto the battery.   OP may have been saved by a low-current supply."

electronics,39ulh6,jaseg,5,Mon Jun 15 19:22:56 2015 UTC,Well no crap. It's basic EE thermal design. At least real suppliers give you a datasheet with what the specs are for given operating points and how much it'll need to be derated thermally.  Setting up one of these at <1K/W isn't too hard given how cheap high performance CPU heatsinks are these days.
electronics,39ulh6,AdShea,2,Mon Jun 15 19:26:33 2015 UTC,"Yes. I have only read the datasheet of an older series of LEDs from this manufacturer so far, and in that one they even specify short-term overload conditions (as in, 1.5 times the rated current for 10 seconds).  The 70 degrees figure is problematic if you want to cool the device passively under elevated operating temperatures. Consider a ceiling light that shall work at full output at 40 degrees air temperature and must be quiet. In that application, you are pretty much limited to 10 to 30W of power dissipation per module as finding a passive heatsink below 1K/W is quite hard, and those things tend to be expensive."

It's not obvious to me that they are defective, but maybe there is an issue. A better example would be if you could demonstrate a short life time, or show that some of them have bad strings.  I have worked with white LEDs from reputable suppliers, and they don't recommend running them below maybe 10% of rated current.

I wouldn't say it's ""nonsense"" but for a slow system like an oven it really isn't needed. The Pd will not directly help with the precision (although it will let you increase Pi which does help). The Pd is here to ""predict"" the error, which means the system will reach the target temperature faster. However it also means that your regulator will be more sensitive to noise. Even the Pi isn't required, you can even regulate an oven with just an on/off switch (a mechanical thermostat for example) and still have a stable closed loop."

The thing with smokers is that it just doesn't matter.  If you stay at +/- 5 degrees then you're already better than most home kitchen ovens.  Mine stays +/- 1 degree and only a couple degrees of overshoot if I open the door for a couple of minutes.  I really should map the terms at some point though.
electronics,39wfid,antiquarian_bookworm,10,Tue Jun 16 01:43:25 2015 UTC,"The values you end up with depend on the characteristics of the load. That's a pretty obvious statement, but it's a starting point to understanding which thing to tweak. An intuitive feel for what PID is doing can help you tune it.  Imagine a system with a motive force (the heater) and a load (the thermal mass). In a stiff system, it would be like you have a small mass on the end of a rigid stick, when you move the stick, the mass moves proportionally. An easy control scheme that behaves well to pure proportional control. So, to keep things simple, we can just use proportional control.  But now image you have a mass on the end of an elastic band. When you move the band, the mass starts to head the right direction, and when you try to stop, the mass compresses the band to create overshoot. You try to correct it, and you end up creating an oscillation. That's an elastic system like your heater and thermal mass.  So we introduce the integral adjustment. It looks at how long you have been off target in a certain direction and bumps up the force to reduce the lag time of waiting for the mass to get to the set point. If the integral is not high enough, you can languish below or above set point for a very long time. But, if you overcrank the integral contribution to the force, you have pulled too hard on the band and the mass will come charging at the set point too fast and overshoot and oscillate.  The integral has a ""memory"" of how long you have been one one side of the target or the other, and trim the force to try to get it to the set point. The longer you have been away, the more in cranks up. Some systems can do well with just P and I, so you keep the D value down or off, to keep things simple.  The derivative contribution to the equation looks at this RATE of approaching the set point, an if the rate is too low it cranks up, and if it is too fast, it cranks down. It can damp the response of the integral. The down side is that now you have two elastic type of controls to tweak the coefficients on, and it is easy to get them tangled up. So you tend to only introduce D when you know you need it.  The coefficients are how much ""say"" each element of P and I and D have in the behavior of the system. Once you know what each one does, then you can watch the system and trim the values in an intuitive manner. Always start P, then crank I as you watch it and see it needs to be more responsive, and then only introduce D when it is close to stable.  Sometimes a control has suggested values for certain types of systems based on how responsive (elastic or rigid) the system is. These can be a good starting point, but you need to know what the elements of the equation are doing if you are going to trim them.  A system that changes often needs trimming. So on a cold day the thermal mass is different than when the sun is shining on it on a hot day. Trying to find values that give good behavior under all conditions can be a challenge, so sometimes you end up with a different set of coefficients based on system conditions.  EDIT:  I was a college teacher and had to come up with a lecture to explain PID to students, and I would always start with this intuitive explanation before launching into the math and system analysis. It helped a lot for the students to understand where we were going with the equations.  My full explanation was that we have three ""drivers"" attempting to steer a car. One has no understanding of the elastic behavior of the steering (P) and the other two understand the elasticity, but in a different way (I and D). All three want control of the wheel, but the coefficient of each one allows you to say who has more or less  control. I had a real long funny story about three people, Paul, Ingrid, and David, and they have different personalities. Who is the best driver under different conditions? Who should shut up and sit in the back seat? =-}"

electronics,39xnud,dirty_d2,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:26:55 2015 UTC,"No problem, if you want better accuracy it would probably be a good idea to like push the cart so the wheel rotates 20 or so times, and then measure the distance it moved and divide by 20 to get the circumference."
electronics,39xnud,RobinUrthos,2,Thu Jun 18 15:28:02 2015 UTC,"Couple options here:  The easiest method is to set up two infrared sensors (and two IR LEDs) a known distance apart and use a microcontroller to monitor when the path of light is blocked by the cart.  By measuring the time between the first sensor being blocked and the second sensor being blocked, you can calculate the velocity.  This method, obviously, won't work if you need continuous measurement or if the cart does not follow a set path.  The second method is to put some kind of sensor on the wheels--perhaps a Hall effect sensor and a magnet.  Each time the wheel goes around, it triggers the Hall sensor, and you can use the time between triggers and the wheel diameter circumference to calculate the velocity.  This works well provided that there is minimal skidding and that your wheels are where you want to measure your velocity.  (If the cart turns, different wheels may measure different velocities.  You may need to put sensors on all of the wheels to account for this.)  A third method is to use a patterned floor and a camera to track the motion of the cart.  If your cart is small and the floor is smooth, you could probably find a way to use an optical gaming mouse to accomplish this.  If your cart follows a track, you can use a light sensor pointed at a striped pattern beside the track.  (You could also use sonar or IR ranging to follow the position of the cart if it follows a track.)  The fourth method, an IMU, is somewhat expensive.  The thing about IMUs is that they work by integrating the output from an accelerometer.  That means that they need incredibly accurate accelerometers, so it probably won't be much different from just using an accelerometer, from a cost-accuracy perspective.  The last method that I can think of, GPS, is easy but imprecise.  Although it will be accurate for large vehicles and fairly high velocities, it probably isn't appropriate for what I'm assuming is a small cart.  But if we're talking car-sized or larger, this is probably the way to go."
electronics,39xnud,crwper,3,Mon Jun 15 17:42:16 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth, a GPS chipset like the u-blox 6/7/8 with Doppler velocity measurement will get an accuracy of about 0.1 m/s.

The concept of optical flow was introduced by the American psychologist James J. Gibson in the 1940s to describe the visual stimulus provided to animals moving through the world.  Gibson stressed the importance of optic flow for affordance perception, the ability to discern possibilities for action within the environment. Followers of Gibson and his ecological approach to psychology have further demonstrated the role of the optical flow stimulus for the perception of movement by the observer in the world; perception of the shape, distance and movement of objects in the world; and the control of locomotion.  Recently the term optical flow has been co-opted by roboticists to incorporate related techniques from image processing and control of navigation, such as motion detection, object segmentation, time-to-contact information, focus of expansion calculations, luminance, motion compensated encoding, and stereo disparity measurement.

electronics,39ttxu,Planetariophage,2,Sun Jun 14 20:52:54 2015 UTC,"Combining the formulated version of the op-amps (integrators, differentiators, etc.) does not seem overwhelmingly hard. A bit of a learning curve the first few times I would imagine for myself, but easy enough as you say.  I'm talking about literally the op-amps themselves. I took linear circuits and understand it is equivalent to voltage controlled voltage source, with infinite input impedance and some other property with the output. Beyond that not complete understanding, I was garbage at doing the analysis to derive what the output function is given the inputs, and futhermore what exactly the resistance on the input is.  Really I think I never had a great ability to apply KVL and KCL to circuits. I understand them, but did not do enough rigor to use them successfully. One day, I would like to know more, but as a software focused CompE it's not critical, but helpful"
electronics,39ttxu,cpmpal,5,Sun Jun 14 21:28:53 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it could be simplified. I mean, an RC oscillator models a differential equation without any op amps at all -- so what's the simplest circuit you could build that would demonstrate chaotic behaviour (in the mathematical sense, not in the ""well, that's just noise"" sense)?"

It isn't possible to build anything exhibiting chaotic behaviour with only linear elements, so you need at least 1 non-linear device.  And, non-linear differential equations can still have well-behaved solutions.  I can't imagine being able to implement a chaotic circuit without atleast a single op-amp (or a couple transistors), or some kind of fairly exotic component."

electronics,39qsuf,dizekat,2,Sun Jun 14 07:21:23 2015 UTC,"Bottom line is, the high quality, high cost option is to re-do the board rather than to make free-hanging solder joints directly between the components. It's more akin to standardizing how (in particularly cheap made in china power supplies) when they run out of resistors that have the right value they daisy-chain two or three instead.  The joint between the components themselves is not the issue; the issue is that if say you daisy chained 3 resistors with strain relief, there's >3x the mass hanging off 1x the wires (with all the solder), and also 3x the slack for it to wiggle around if it vibrates, breaking the wires attaching your free-hanging creation to the board."
electronics,39qsuf,zimm3rmann,-17,Sun Jun 14 14:44:17 2015 UTC,"Ghmm. The hook joints look horrid. I would never do that in repair, simply because I don't want something to come loose, short out, and start a fire (especially as there's a resistor involved... some failure somewhere could cause it to melt the solder). Rest would greatly benefit from use of some crimp piece and a crimper tool (perhaps combined with soldering), as twisting wires really is very error prone, could damage the component (if it's a capacitor for instance), etc.  There's no money for double redundancy of anything in consumer electronics, either; single point fails the whole thing fails.  NASA can get away with 1..2% deadly failure rate of Space Shuttle missions as chances are for the first 25 missions nobody's going to die; you can't get away with this deadly failure rate on a car, you can't get away with 1% ""starts an electrical fire"" rate on an appliance, or a tool, and so on. And a regular airliner has to be enormously more reliable than anything space agencies produce.  Bottom line is, you can't be taking practices from NASA (or any other space agency for that matter) and expect them to be any good whatsoever for consumer electronics. It'd suck if repair people start doing hook joints. A lot of consumer electronics vibrates for years. Airplanes are a good example of reliability, spacecraft and the like aren't."
electronics,39qsuf,dizekat,17,Sat Jun 13 21:51:01 2015 UTC,"Uhm, but NASA standards aren't just for spacecraft. They are for all things NASA. Even for hardware that will never go into space. Things that won't even leave the surface of our planet. They have their own workmanship standards, which are clearly based on MIL and civilian standards. And it has nothing to do with ""getting away"" with higher failure rates. It's quite the opposite. These standards are to prevent failures. You use these standards in ""hostile"" environments where the components are more prone to extreme temperature variations, mechanical wear, etc which in turn could result in material and solder fatigue.  Perhaps you should read the guide I linked to, as each splice has a description telling you where they are suitable for use, and even when they are unsuitable to use.  It's like claiming MIL standards are only for hardware going into combat. And yet you find MIL standards being used in shitloads of civilian applications."
electronics,39qsuf,dizekat,-13,Sat Jun 13 22:30:51 2015 UTC,"Hook joint is not a connection you can use in a ""hostile"" environment. It's a connection you simply shouldn't use anywhere."

electronics,39qsuf,Bromskloss,-9,Sat Jun 13 23:07:40 2015 UTC,"They did hinge it on shoddy O-rings for the Challenger, run outside their temperature specifications and with re-used tubes of the solid rocket booster (which get bent when they fall into the water and have to be unbent). On the earlier missions, the rings had been burnt 1/3 of the way through, which was deemed to be a safety factor of 3 somehow (see what Feynman had to say).   And, for Colombia, they lost their on-going gamble since the 1980s that the known issue with tiles getting broken off by falling foam and ice during the launch would not lead to a shuttle breaking apart during landing."
electronics,39qsuf,dizekat,12,Sat Jun 13 23:15:17 2015 UTC,"The Challenger disaster was the result of the engineer, Allan McDonald, in charge of the o-rings being over ridden by his boss.  He was the only one who would not sign off on the launch check due to the fact the o-rings never had been tested at the temps they were launched at.  This was an ego at work that ignored the guide lines and didn't want to be the cause for a launch delay.  The Columbia damage was scrutinized over and over and they could not find any critical damage to the orbiter though there was still some suspect that something was wrong.  Fundamentally NASA was left with a decision of sending an orbiter up for a rescue mission or have the orbiter attempt a landing.  The man who made that decision was a gentleman at mission control for NASA over in Russia.  He made a managerial decision that cost 7 peoples lives, most of which he personally knew.  The first was the failure of someone over ridding safety protocols cause of their ego.  People died. The second was one man, who in hind sight, made the wrong choice. People died.  You're basing your view on NASA's solder procedures on two things that have nothing to do with the procedures at hand because you personally think it's a bad design/practice, when the only way NASA will sign off on these types of things is that they have the lowest failure rate possible because either millions of dollars in gear is lost, people die, or both.  So please, stop being ignorant and disrespectful towards these people.  It's not needed and makes you look like an uneducated jerk."

Bottom line is, you can't be taking practices from NASA (or any other space agency for that matter) and expect them to be any good whatsoever for consumer electronics.   Of course not.

electronics,39qsuf,Seventytvvo,-1,Sun Jun 14 04:32:26 2015 UTC,"Well, the high cost, best option is to re-do the board, not to solder components to one another or wires with the joint hanging in the air.

That document also mentions insulation (say heatshrink) being mandatory on hook joints. Now imagine that joint, properly soldered together with a form fitting tube around it.

You simply should not be attaching component leads to each other or to wires in the air in anything that is in any way critical enough to bother standardizing. Doing it right is not doing it - it's having boards redone or having the components made of correct physical dimensions and wire length. And if  you are doing it anyway, fold both leads back upon themselves at least and solder that as well, that gives far greater strength. Edit: also, connections where wire may easily move  during soldering are much worse with non eutectic solder."

Hope this information is helpful; disreguard if this doesn't apply to your situation.  I was thinking the difference might be that one is an audio taper pot, and that the smaller has a linear taper. Look up the specs, and compare.  In a linear pot, the resistance applied is linear. In an audio pot, the resistance is applied in a logarithmic way. So the two scale resistance very differently across the travel of the control- even if they are both 250K ohm devices.  Also, if your audio pot has some kind of on/off or ""switch"" feature, thats probably not a feature that would be desirable in a scenario where youre supplying a control voltage to a device input. For example, is it a desired outcome to sometimes short that control voltage and that control circuit input to ground? Just asking :)"
electronics,39shwk,philbuddy,1 point,Sun Jun 14 13:16:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, as dokid suggested, check your pots with an ohm meter. Of course, I mean check the pots OUT of circuit:)  Write down the ohms value for each at 4 or 5 positions:  Fully ON at 25% at 50% fully ON  Compare those readings for the two pots and you can get a sense of how the two compare in taper or the way resistance is scaled across the range.  Good luck!!!"

electronics,39rp81,a_culther0,5,Sun Jun 14 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"Alright, here we go. Inventing this shouldn't be too hard, we just have to know what tools to use and what parts are appropriate.   Major considerations:   Enclosure Power Management Microcontroller Wireless Communication Vibration device Wireless Controller Design   For the enclosure, I'd recommend looking into polycase. They have some very nice, reasonably priced enclosures you could put your prototype inside of, and they might even have enclosures with hardware to hook up velcro/belt straps to latch it to her arm.  For the power management, I'm a little inexperienced. But, there are a few things that you'll want think about.   You can purchase smaller LithiumIon backup battery devices with USB micro input for charging and constant 5V output. This is an example of an excellent backup battery that would probably run your system for days. There's a $5 dollar version of this from some generic chinese manufacturer for sale at a store called 5 Below, which is like a preteen girl- focused yard sale (it's hell). But the enclosures of these types of devices should come apart very easily (the 5 Below one does) and you can use a dremel to carve the necessary ports in your enclosure to mount the USB sockets. Then dump hot glue on that biz until satisfied.  One more thing that's important for battery powered devices is the ability to turn them off. I've found putting a mechanical switch on the positive lead from the power supply to the microcontroller/peripheral devices is a great way for home brew prototypes to be controlled. Something like this.  There are processing considerations for battery powered devices. It'd be nice if you could monitor the battery level with some LED indicators. Using a few digital pins on your micro and an analog input to measure a voltage divider straight from the battery pack can give you this. Just charge it to full, serial.Print() the analog value read, hook up a USB fan or something until the battery backup device is completely drained, and then read the analog value again. Set up some if(readvalue > dead && readvalue < 1st power level) { digitalWrite(led1, HIGH); digitalWrite(led2,LOW); digitalWrite(led3,LOW); } stuff.  For the processor, you SHOULD use a perf-board ATMega328P. You can program it on your arduino and then put it into a 28 pin socket that you solder to your perf board. The regulator, the onboard LEDs, all of that is wasted power for your application. If that's too much work, just use a nano. I'd strongly recommend using female headers to plug the nano into, if (and when) the thing doesn't work and you have to scrap it and start over.  For the wireless communication, grab yourself a few NRF24L01+ modules. They're like a buck each on ebay. There is a huge amount of documentation and example code for them, too.  For the vibration device, I found this motor on ebay, HERE. I'm sure you could find a 5V version, but because it only draws 60mA max and it's just a dumb motor, I'm sure you could just use a resistor voltage divider to give it 3V ish and it'll run fine.  For the wireless controller design, get some pushbuttons, another polycase enclosure, an Arduino nano, an NRF24L01+, and program it to send a command to run the motor for 2 seconds upon pressing. Throw another battery backup device in there.  Let me know if you have any criticisms or questions.  EDIT: For a complete system with one strap on vibration alert device and one remote, I'd say you could get away with paying as little as 40 bucks, though that would require waiting a month for slow boat from china parts. If you want to have this thing built within a week, look at paying upwards of 60 bucks for all of the parts for the entire thing. Still, I imagine if there were a mass produced wireless remote for an arm band type vibration alert system for deaf children with the device and remove being rechargeable it'd cost at least 60 bucks, so I'd probably jump on it if I were you."

The board is barebone 8 LEDs and that's it, with plenty of breakouts, which makes it great for experimentation and permanent bodge jobs: http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Lattice/LCMXO2-7000HE-B-EVN/?qs=DBbQ3l7BldNJuSVNFnSpPw%3d%3d  Lattice's Diamond IDE is very similar to the Xilinx and Altera IDE and it's also free.  I really love the MachXO2 chips because they come in TQFP packages (can be hand soldered) and they even include voltage regulators so you can feed them with just 3.3v for instance. These are technically CPLDs so they have Flash on die, very easy to use basically. The on board flash can take tons of writes, I remember comparing specs while back and Altera and Xilinx CPLDs had a really low write count. The best part is you can get low quantity chips fro mouser for like $4-$15 depending on how much logic units you need."

A ground loop is a specific situation where two grounded pieces of equipment with a grounded connection between them form a circuit.  The ground wires then act as a shorted turn or inductive pickup for any stray magnetic fields that are changing.  This can cause significant currents to flow in the loop, which in turn induce voltages inside the various pieces of equipment which can become superimposed on the signal.  There's a zillion ways to add interference to a signal, ground loop describes a specific one which is impossible if one of the pieces of equipment is not externally grounded."

Generally mics on long leads are wired in a 'balanced' configuration, where:   shield -> ground red -> one lead of mic white -> other lead of mic   (ground is not connected to the mic at all)  The red and white wires carry mirror image signals of each other.  A differential amplifier (or isolating transformer) is then used to extract the desired waveform from the negative and positive variations ( output = Vred - Vwhite or similar ).  The advantage is rejection of signals common to both wires.  If an external field induces an almost identical spike on both wires (because they're close together and run the same way) then it won't affect the difference between the two signals (what we're using, Vred - Vwhite ).

Would it be worth using a better microphone?
electronics,39r35f,Veyrdite,2,Sat Jun 13 23:32:34 2015 UTC,"Any microphone can be either wired balanced or unbalanced, including yours.  It's up to you to make the separation -- ie don't connect the can to gnd.  It's not a feature of the microphone (although having a separate can would be nicer) but instead a feature of how you wire it up.  Basically all cheap electret microphones look identical externally.  Keep in mind that the capsule is only one part of a nice recording device:  directionality (controlled by the shape of materials around the capsule) and the electronics side are just as/more important, depending on your situation.  I don't know what you're after however, but just beware there are pitfalls you may encounter.  The best thing you can do is try an easy setup and see how it performs.  If it's not good enough then consider increasing complexity bit by bit until it works well enough."

electronics,39quct,jakerc,6,Sat Jun 13 21:31:17 2015 UTC,"I build a circuit that connects +5V -> LED -> GND. What is the current through that circuit?   See the typical VI curve. Note how it goes basically vertical as the voltage rises.  For most LEDs, the theoretical current could be hundreds to thousands of amps - needless to say the actual current will be lower due to imperfections of the led and circuit, and magic smoke will probably come out of something eventually.  The resistor is critical, in this case it acts as a voltage (difference) to current converter, and feeds the led with a (pseudo) constant current to avoid excessive, damaging forward current.  LEDs must always be current-fed as they choose their own voltage. You can skip the resistor if you have a more elaborate constant current source, like a constant-current switcher or LED driver."
electronics,39quct,triffid_hunter,2,Sat Jun 13 23:36:12 2015 UTC,"An important thing to remember about LEDs is that they are, as the initialism comes from, Diodes - once their forward voltage is met they begin conducting, and an increase in voltage will decrease their effective resistance.  If your LED forward voltage is significantly lower than 5V, 5V could potentially turn the LED basically into a short circuit, which is where FullFrontalNoodly's comment comes in - the current through the LED will be theoretically infinite, but in reality limited by the resistance and current supplying capacity of the power source (and as beta_release said, if your supply is a digital pin from an Arduino, it will likely be damaged).  Both of those states depend on the LED not actually being destroyed by that high current, which usually isn't the case.  One useful thing you may want to look into, if you just want to run LEDs directly from 5V (either direct or from an Arduino logic pin) is a ""rLED"" - Mouser sells LEDs (at least red) that operate at 5V, by having a resistor built into the package.  http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Kingbright/WP710A10SRD5V/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvHYEB9WUp7EiQZxlvRfFmos%252be4DHFYydc%3d is one I found with a quick search.  Having a stock of those on hand for quick testing/indicating could be useful.  More experienced hobbyists/EEs, please feel free to correct any of the above - it's correct as far as I know, though."
electronics,39quct,maicrodrop,2,Sat Jun 13 22:51:44 2015 UTC,"The current will be an exponential function involving the temperature and color (junction type) of the LED. Or, more realistically, whatever the maximum current output of the Arduino or power supply. In any case, the answer is probably ""too much"".  If you're lucky, you burn out the LED. If you're unlucky, the Arduino."
electronics,39quct,service_unavailable,2,Sun Jun 14 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"At lower currents, an LED has a VI curve like a diode, but with a higher forward voltage than a silicon diode. That is, the current is an exponential function of voltage.  However, it also has a series resistance. That's what will limit the current at high voltage, so you won't actually get 100 A at 5 V. But an LED will be destroyed promptly once you get above about 250 mA, so you won't get much chance to observe the high-current operation.  Another issue is temperature. Forward voltage drops by several mV per degree C as the LED heats up, so that makes it tricky to plot the VI curve at higher currents."
electronics,39quct,1wiseguy,4,Sun Jun 14 15:51:10 2015 UTC,"If you have an Arduino you can look up the datasheet for the ATMEGA32 especially on page 310 where it discusses the output current vs voltage for the digital output pins.   Figure 175 shows that as you increase the current you draw the voltage will decrease. The LED will have a similar graph in its datasheet showing the opposite. As the current through the LED increases the forward voltage will also increase. At some current these two will overlap which will give you your operating current.   Unfortunately it's not quite this simple because if you read the electrical characteristics section (page 287) you'll see that the maximum current per IO pin is 40mA. Beyond this current you'll likely damage your Arduino. So if the froward voltage of your LED is less than the voltage in Fig 175 at 40mA (3.8V) you will damage your Arduino. If 40mA is greater than the rating of your LED you may damage your LED as well (it depends which breaks first and whether it fails open circuit or short circuit).   TL;DR not using a resistor with your LED will probably end up releasing the magic smoke.  Edit: I'm assuming you're using an IO pin to provide the 5V, otherwise the current will likely be much higher and the result is the same. Smoke."

electronics,39o0z8,sanels,1 point,Sat Jun 13 04:10:27 2015 UTC,The certification on a module is irrelevant here.   If you want to sell a commercial product you are going to need to go through FCC approval regardless.  The use of a certified module merely means it won't cause your project to fail certification.
electronics,39o0z8,antiquarian_bookworm,1 point,Sat Jun 13 03:48:26 2015 UTC,"Well I'm assuming it'll be a lot cheaper to use parts that are already certified. From my research it would cost $1,000 to $2,000 to get certified using previously certified RF versus $10,000 - $15,000 for non certified RF.   I just need to figure out if the cost of using a modified esp8266 is cheaper than using a slightly more expensive pre certified rf when factoring in FCC costs."

Shouldn't need a heatsink, but if you do, you'll notice it getting warm before it blows up.  (side note, you can switch an optotriac on/off every half cycle with a resistive load with nothing too funny happening, but if these use different internals, it might not be happy with that fast of switching)"

electronics,39gzl2,CarbonGod,4,Thu Jun 11 18:06:25 2015 UTC,"Reflux still. Due to the fact that I had to leave and couldn't test and tune PID (not sure if it's necessary at all in this case), it's only set up in manual mode right now for 1 on 1 off in a 2 second cycle where the period of heating is regulated with the potentiometer which is absurdly sensitive midrange (any tips?).  I'm not using a thermocouple - the sensor is DS18B20. The target temperature seems in the right range for the usual accuracy so it should be alright."
electronics,39gzl2,CarbonGod,2,Thu Jun 11 19:23:46 2015 UTC,"You want to control the heat input based on the product output rate and/or reflux rate, not the temperature of the wash you're trying to distill.  The boiling point of your liquid is set by the ratio of alcohol to water.  You can see that relationship on this chart.  What you want to control is how much heat you're introducing into the liquid, or how hard/fast it is boiling.  This is entirely different from beer brewing PID setups where you're usually trying to control your strike water/mash temperature at a sub-boiling point while you're mashing on the grains.  Once you drain your wort off and move to your boil kettle you're back to controlling the boil rate not temperature.  Pop over to /r/firewater for a ton of information all about this fun (and tasty) hobby.  It really isn't as dangerous as the media would hype it up to be as long as you take a little time to educate yourself on how it all works, make sure your setup is open to the atmosphere (so pressure can never build,) and to properly protect those exposed mains voltage terminals!"
electronics,39gzl2,ytsoc,2,Fri Jun 12 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"The temperature sensor goes to the top of the column and reads vapour temperature which is always the same. So far that has worked as I get.  Other than that, I am not myself into distilling, just made a solution (hopefully) for the problem my granddad had. That is the awful energy losses of using a rheostat for controlling the voltage.  Thanks for the sub suggestion, will definitely check that and pass on the good info!"
electronics,39gzl2,spainguy,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:29:12 2015 UTC,"Ok, excellent.  My experience so far is just with a pot still, so there is no reflux involved.  I have most of the copper now to build a reflux head but I haven't started that project yet.  My understanding from the reading I've done on a reflux style of still is that you still need to vary the wattage output of the heating elements rather than cycling them on/off.  A phase angle controller is the best way to do it.  The temperature should stay the same at the top of the reflux column, but will change based upon the reflux and take-off rates of the product.  You need to monitor the temperature for stability, then adjust your product output flow valve and/or the heat input to maintain that stability.  Then when certain criteria are met, you turn up the heat and open it up to finish off the tails.  Rather than a standard SSR with on/off capability, it is recommended that you use one that allows control via a variable resistor.  This is the one I picked up to use in my conversion from propane to electric heat.  Again I haven't actually built it yet (still need to get a bung welded on to my keg for the heating element) but this is recommended by others that have made the same setup.  Good luck with the project!  It is a lot of fun."

You could have spoken about the fact that the meter has some movs.   There appears to be a physical keepout slot on the pcb for the terminals.   The fuses, although the suppressing type, are not the type of fuse you should see in a cat iv rated meter.   This meter shouldn't have a cat iv rating.

electronics,39d30i,EkriirkE,2,Wed Jun 10 23:33:35 2015 UTC,"They serially connect and serially shift data along the chain, the first LED is the LED that connects to the controller and takes the first 24 bits of data it sees, then ignores everything else and passes that along to the next, the 2nd LED now gets the ""overflow"" and grabs the first 24bits it sees then ignores & passes, etc-- repeating until data transmission stops for at least 50uS then they light up.

While all of the solder is liquid, pull the connector out. You will be left with hole filled with solder, but you could then suck that out easily enough.

A quality solder sucker cost ~$15 and you will never look back, I only use wick for cleaning pads not clearing holes."
electronics,398vzn,dmyerty,5,Wed Jun 10 03:56:55 2015 UTC,"My high school electronics class had solid 15$ solder suckers, like 45 of them. They sucked shit, like seriously sucked shit. If you are off by 3 degrees when you let go, it sucks up nothing, if your hand moves at all when you press the button, it sucks up nothing. Wick is 100 times better at least to me."

electronics,39bdry,emcniece,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:03:14 2015 UTC,"There seem to be a few different setups using stepper motors, but that seems like a significant amount of effort just to get a platform to spin.  I'd personally be inclined to go with a servo like this one and attach a few gears to get the action, as servos are a bit easier to control than steppers. The downside is that servos are typically limited to a maximum rotation, but the guy talks about the pros and cons of converting this very servo to a 360 degree spin in the first half of this video.  After writing a bit of code for an arduino and hooking up the servo, I'd probably look for some gears, one for the servo and one to mount to the bottom of the platform. Some bearings to support the outer edges of the platform might help it spin nicely while distributing weight on something other than the servo.  Of course, a plan like this is pretty DIY. How dirty are you willing to get?"

electronics,395hus,davidb_,5,Tue Jun 9 11:56:01 2015 UTC,"With respect to using Arduinos/microcontrollers as part of the project kits- you'll end up spending an awful lot of time teaching beginners how to program, which can be a pretty deep rabbit hole. Not to mention having to deal with the inconsistencies in programming/flashing environments that you'd have to deal with (OS, drivers, cables, etc). Even though there're a million resources on how to 'fix' that kind of thing out on the internet, by supplying the product you assume the responsibility of supporting it, software-wise, to some extent.  The esp8266, or some bluetooth module if you were able to get a good price, might be a good way around the programming aspect. Clients could ""program"" the robot with their web browser or smart phone, using a ""Settings"" web page. I think this would do wonders for ease of use if you threw microcontrollers in the mix, but of course, would somewhat limit customization.  I suppose a good starting point for thinking up kits would be to identify simple skills that are important with electronics (in general I guess) and think up kits that teach those skills while also doing something interesting.   Basic circuit components and their functions (resistors, caps, diodes/leds, transistors, batteries). Anything that blinks can pretty much handle all of that. Transistors as amplifiers can make pretty cool capacitive touch sensors. A kit that included some kind of touch control would be neat. Making an adjustable time delay with a potentiometer and a cap is something that could be incorporated into stuff- when a robot hits a wall or something, it backs up/changes direction for a certain amount of time, determined by an RC circuit, before moving forward again. Common functions: amplification, analog-to-digital conversion (and vice-versa), filtering, comparing/summing/multiplying, etc. For amplification, the obvious application is with sound, in one way or another. Throw an LM386 in the circuit with a speaker and let the user upload a wav file via the web interface that the robot or whatever will play. Have a recording mechanism in the circuit that lets them push a button and record some message for the robot to play. With any circuit, the filtering part is pretty important, even if if it's just implemented as a monster capacitor on Vcc. ADC doesn't have to be as advanced as talking to a chip with SPI or whatever and doing conversions... get a 5-bit ADC and connect it to 5 LEDs to use as a battery charge indicator or a speed indicator or something. You can do some neat stuff with comparators... and what I was going for as far as multiplying goes is modulation. A really basic  radio transmitter as part of the kit could be cool, and wouldn't be necessarily complex, parts-wise. Kits covering as many different kinds of sensors as you can get a hold of, and possibly creative ways to use these sensors. A CO2 sensor for determining how many people are in the room/immediate surrounding, robot waypoints with IR LEDs on ""throwies"", or hell.. just a cool weather station-type thing. Control systems, or doing something with that sensor data.. any kind of '(sensor info source)-based (mechanical/electrical thing) control', even if the two sound completely stupid together. In the 'web interface' dreamed up in one of those earlier paragraphs, have the ability to connect a  sensor input to some output, throwing some conditionals in there. If people can make the kits/projects ""theirs"" instead of some cookie-cutter thing, I  feel like they'd be more apt to continue with the whole thing. ""I made my robot so every time someone presses a button on the TV remote, it makes a farting noise"" can eventually lead to ""My robot follows the TV remote around"".   So with that rambling out of the way, I think you could hook more beginners by minimizing or eliminating any kind of coding. However, it's obviously not easy to allow a high level of customization without programming on the client's end. It will take some creative thinking and probably quite a bit of work to hit  your all of your goals for a kit (good for beginners, customizable, and ""flashy"").   At the heart of all of this, I think a good plan is to try to introduce people to all of the possibilities of electronics. Those that stay interested will start to think of new ways to use circuits/components that you've shown them with your learning app. After a few months' worth of kits, they might think ""hey... I could add touch control to this month's mp3 player kit by using that circuit I was given for last month's robot kit"". Once they start mixing and matching, that's when the magic happens (hopefully..)."

electronics,395hus,ragamufin,2,Tue Jun 9 19:59:06 2015 UTC,"Hey,  I won a sub to your first kit at startup weekend - Makers in DC and I'm really excited for it.  I think the biggest sticking point you will hit is with the arduino.  I dove in headfirst a few months ago and I am loving the process of finding new libraries, learning syntax, and getting my individual chips running, but there are a lot of makers and crafty people who have basically no experience or interest in arduino beyond plug and play.  I'd strongly recommend you preload the arduino's with the code they need to run, and have them setup for jumper pins (no solder).  I'd also recommend the code you include on the arduino's have several clearly labeled 'tweak' points, where someone loading up the arduino IDE for the first time might see a variable called 'robot_speed = 10' with some annotations explaining how they might tweak this and see an immediate impact on how their creation functions.  I'm really looking forward to seeing my kit in the mail!  To actually answer your Qs:    I'm intermediate in electronics.  Mostly self taught over the last year.  Robots are a good start.  Quad copters are hot right now and pretty easy if you can find a decent IMU (check out MPU 6050).  Cool desk gadgets are fun too, there are lots of almost perpetual motion machines that will tick/swing/rotate away on your desk for months on a button cell.  Running these things off a tiny solar cell is amazing and very satisfying.  Put it on a window sill on a sunny day and watch it whirl away.  The variety of things people can design with a kit for this purpose is very broad.  Really my objective is to practice my fundamentals and add cool bits to my box of maker stuff.   I'm not very active in this sub, I'd strongly recommend a crosspost to /r/Maker and maybe /r/arduino."

The no-solder thing is something we've been going back and forth on, trying to get feedback from potential customers. It's a hurdle for complete beginners but many people that are interested in the kits have told us they already have soldering irons and everything they need. Others have said they want to learn.   The 'tweak' points idea is good for a complete novice programmer. My vision for implementing that has been code snippets and prompts through the app that push you towards the answer and explain the code as you go. Pre-loading the code is difficult with the approach I was planning for the learning app (connect and test each module - motor, wifi module, etc) and then integrate everything.

electronics,395hus,daguro,2,Tue Jun 9 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"It is something I might be interested in for the correct price.     I like to think I have a decent grasp on electronics (self taught mostly) and am set on the programming aspect (CS degree). I'd be interested in Robotic, Quadcoptors, Hexapods, and Home Automation/Sensing I'd like to learn something from each kit and have a working X That said I already have more ideas for things than I have time to make and I feel that most people who get into (and actually like not just got it as a gift) arduino / maker are in the same boat with projects. If I do run out of ideas I can very easily browse here /r/arudinoprojects, /r/arduino, /r/DIY, instructables, or even just google to find some new ideas. Other than (I'm assuming) providing all the materials (which can be useful) what makes your kits (for projects I may not want to do) useful than finding my own ideas? It might work if you had several ""Kits"" that people could buy that came in X number of projects with a ""finished"" project after each month.  So for a Robot Kit you could have the basic 2 wheel robot as month 1.  Then month 2 would add an ultrasonic sensor and maybe Bluetooth connection etc.  So you have a working robot after the first month but you learn how to improve it in the following months.  I'd also say if you go this option maybe having a send it now option to get the next month early.   Not trying to be negative but it sounds like your trying to set up a X of the month club and I'm not sure how that would work out since not everyone wants the same thing out of it.

Great question, since it gets right to the core of what we can offer. I've got a few points.    As you say, there is value in providing the components. But, First, I do think there is a gap in learning materials. There's tons of info out there, but sorting through it can be difficult and, short of textbooks, there is a lack of structured learning content that allows you to complete projects but still dive down into the theory. Second, I think motivation can be a real problem for people. I've got plenty of friends (even grads of CS/CE programs) that have bought an arduino/raspberry pi with the intent of doing projects, but a year or two later just have it sitting in a box with other dev boards. The hope is that ordering a kit and having a clear objective will get people to complete projects and get them to a point where they have the knowledge/skills and baseline platform to be creative and add their own components to solve interesting problems. Finally, I can't speak for everyone, but I do get a great sense of satisfaction from actually completing projects. I think the community we're trying to build and the support (from Oscar, Mike, and myself) will be valuable to you if you get stuck somewhere along the build process. As you allude to, having a working X after finishing the project is a pretty great outcome.   That said, I'd never discourage anyone from finding and implementing their own ideas. I totally understand that impulse and share it to some extent. At the same time, though, I got started building kits and eventually modifying them. And, I find myself going back to ordering kits from time to time when I see something that interests me. Standing on the shoulder of giants and all that good stuff.  Which, to another point:   I'm not sure how that would work out since not everyone wants the same thing out of it.   This is similar to what afatsumcha said. I think once we ship our first couple of projects and build up a decent ""library"" of kits, we'll be able to clearly show what we can offer. I'm big on transparency (everything will be released under an open source license), so I want every customer to know what they're getting so they have a good experience.   It might work if you had several ""Kits"" that people could buy that came in X number of projects with a ""finished"" project after each month   This is something we've been discussing as well. Particularly with complex projects like a drone. Basically, amortize the cost and time of more complex builds. Even the robot, as you say, could fit into this.   Thanks for the feedback!"

electronics,395hus,Hadrosauroidea,2,Wed Jun 10 06:13:35 2015 UTC,"I'm super late to the commenting party here, but I just want to throw in my two cents. First of all, I love this idea and am really looking forward to it. I've dabbled with stuff here and there over the last year or two, but it's often hard to find inspiration to build something that also takes me out of my comfort zone. It's also sometimes hard to find explanations about components that don't make assumptions that I know how other stuff works, so learning in the context of a self-contained project is appealing.   I've seen a lot of talk about pricing. My inclination is to say that I'd totally be down for $50/month, but if I think about it for a second, I see myself dropping it sooner than if it was cheaper. Not to add too much complexity to your model, but perhaps tiers might work? I could see myself doing $50/month with one project a month for a while, but eventually other interests and hobbies get more attention and I might want to back it off for a while (or even permanently). It'd be nice to be able to drop down to like a $25/month tier with a project every other month, or even a $20/month with a project every three months."
electronics,395hus,Hadrosauroidea,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:40:57 2015 UTC,I think you're probably right re: tiers. We're going to have to discuss this as a team and see what we can do. Hopefully we can come up with something that's still engaging/exciting/satisfying and meets those price points.

electronics,395hus,ejo4041,2,Wed Jun 10 17:39:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a beginner in electronics. I took E&M in college, but that's kinda meaningless.   I've built a bunch of guitar pedals, and was even able to understand some of the easier circuits. I've also put together some e-cigs, where the PCB was already put together.   I would be interested in a lot of different projects, actually. Learning by doing is much more rewarding to me than being lectured.   The simpler your projects, probably the better. You mentioned using Arduino for a project, and I think even that might be taking it a bit far (I've never works with arduino, so it intimidates me...so take my statement with a grain of salt). Obviously, to do such simple projects would require some creativity.   Making cool things is...cool, but I think projects that demonstrate principles of electronics would be more fun for me (but I geek out really quickly, to the extent that it's a problem).   Also, I like the subscription-based method, but I think you should have a library of projects for people to choose from. If the client doesn't choose a project, send them the default for that month. This way, people will have more options to learn--which I know is generally looked down upon for commercial products, but I think might be helpful in a context where people are actively learning.   Flavor-of-the-month e cig flavors are cool because you vape a flavor and you're done if you can give it to someone, save it for a rainy day, etc. Projects, on the other hand, demand a lot more time and have less of a fan base--so, I would expect people to be much more selective about what they pursue. For example, a TV show of the month would not be very successful. A calendar with different pictures, though, doesn't require me to stop doing anything to enjoy or hate it.   What I mean in the previous paragraph is that consumers will be more discerning with products that cost more--in this case, the extra cost is in the form of time.   In any case, good luck!   Edit: this post might be too long, but I didn't plan through what I wrote."
electronics,395hus,eighthpence,2,Tue Jun 9 12:24:59 2015 UTC,"Learning by doing is much more rewarding to me than being lectured.    I agree! In general, I really like the top-down approach to learning where you make something practical and are exposed to the theory along the way. The way the learning app is structured, you can drill down further into areas that interest you without being overwhelmed by ""lecturing""/theory (or at least that's the vision).   The simpler your projects, probably the better. You mentioned using Arduino for a project, and I think even that might be taking it a bit far   This is interesting feedback. So, you're saying you'd rather see projects without microcontrollers. Stuff like audio amplifiers, guitar effects pedals, etc on the analog side and 7400 series digital logic-based IC projects on the digital side?  From talking to folks at conferences and makerfaires, there is a lot of demand for the flashy projects (like the robot that I've already prototyped, drones, etc.). The robot is no doubt a complicated project, but I've tried to abstract some of the complexity so it's easier to grasp and then dig into the complexity once you've got it working and want to further understand what's going on. I think microcontrollers like Arduino are so popular because many people come into that world with a background in programming, and devices like the arduino make it easy to connect sensors and actuators to their computer software.  My first experience with electronics was one of the Radio Shack 150 in 1 kits and the first project I remember was an alarm system for my room (the sensor was two wires with aluminum foil for contacts attached to the door and frame. If the circuit was opened, it would set off an alarm). These projects were good, but at least at the time, the instruction manual I was following didn't really provide any ""teaching"" of electronics. It was more of a ""wire by number"" kind of kit. It can be tough to avoid that when starting from first principles, but I do think there's a way to do it.   I've never works with arduino, so it intimidates me.   I'd encourage you to buy an arduino and give it a go. Or, just check out the simulator at https://123d.circuits.io/ and go through their examples. Even blinking an LED for the first time can be quite satisfying.   I like the subscription-based method, but I think you should have a library of projects for people to choose from.   This is something we've been discussing as well. Honestly, it's going to be difficult to build up a nice sized library for people to pick from at first (economies of scale). But, I like the idea and it's something I am working on.   What I mean in the previous paragraph is that consumers will be more discerning with products that cost more--in this case, the extra cost is in the form of time.    Well put.   In any case, good luck!    Thanks!"
electronics,395hus,eighthpence,2,Tue Jun 9 13:13:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I believe it when you write that Arduino and flashy projects are popular. It's a personal bias and lack of exploration on my part.   You're absolutely right about the paint-by-numbers approach. Something like this, for a bunch of Arduino/flashy projects would probably be super well-received.   Thanks for the link to the simulator!! Simulations are excellent, letting me wet my feet without worrying over components. I've been meaning to download SPICE. My undergrad degree was in business, I'm doing a biomed grad degree.

Here's a heatmap of the same frequency range without the shielding. Please note that the heatmap in the OP has a higher input gain on the receiver than this one:  http://i.imgur.com/533zru5.png  It does actually seem to produce more noise (as in, higher noise floor) WITH the enclosure and RC-filter, but as you can see, I've also removed some fluctuating sources (albeit adding those eight). This is especially prominent around 137.2 MHz. This is something I need to figure out though, with the help of all of you - hopefully;)"

electronics,395lof,shitcock55,2,Tue Jun 9 14:52:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, I did try that earlier - it made the whole assembly even worse, as I've come to understand that grounding the USB shield directly to the enclosure renders the USB input cable as an antenna. It makes sense, because it really didn't work then. What I haven't tried yet, is what /u/dack42 proposed, namely to add coils to the power wires, and/or connecting the USB GND to the RC-filter as well. This guide: http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8388.pdf?doc_id=13448&family_id=607 (chapter 3.3.3 EMI considerations) says so, at least."

electronics,395lof,tehjrow,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:04:41 2015 UTC,"As far as I could understand from this: http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc8388.pdf?doc_id=13448&family_id=607 (chapter 3.3.3 EMI considerations), doing so would render the USB input cable as an antenna. The USB dongle does probably have it's own RC-filter, but then again, it's made to be inserted straight into the computer, not via a cable.  I did use a total of two ferrite beads on the input cable. One of the reasons why I didn't include coils on the power lines, was because I didn't know how many turns I was supposed to use. Too many turns, and you end up with a higher inductance than the antenna (50ohms), which would unbalance it. Still, I don't know what I'm talking about, really. I made an inductance calculator, but that was for a radio-transmitter I built from scratch. I don't know how to calculate such things on an already built platform.   What can you tell me about the coils? I mean in respect to turns, diameters and material of the cores?"
electronics,394xfc,thisismydesktop,12,Tue Jun 9 07:49:33 2015 UTC,"Actually a fairly common way to build these, albeit usually in a plastic case.

I opened it up to check the 'surge protection' and 'line filtering'.  When seeing the copper wire, my immediate concern was the danger if the bottom of the case was ever bent and made contact with the wires.   I grabbed a continuity tester and it seems the paint offers protection. There are areas where the paint has been removed, for example the screw holes and a small scratch/scuff.  I wonder how much protection that paint really offers?"
electronics,394xfc,FullFrontalNoodly,7,Tue Jun 9 07:52:11 2015 UTC,The problem is much less the construction than the lack of ground (which would cause a breaker to trip if the hot line shorted to the case.)

I guess the only way to test it would be to bend the case so it touches the two wires. If the paint failed, it would short the two copper wires."
electronics,394xfc,gwhlives,2,Tue Jun 9 08:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'd say the paint technically offers protection in the sense that if the copper coils come into contact with the case by being gently pressed against it, like when you plug something into one of the sockets, it should do the job. However, if the surge protector were to be dropped or something like that and the coils impact the case with some force, it could scrape the paint away making the entire case ""hot"". In the USA I believe any product like this would have to have the case attached to a ""mains earth"" which should be at a different enough ground potential to you that all current would rather flow to it than you if you made contact with a hot case. I don't know about your countries electrical code though. I'd say at best the surge protector is dodgy, and at the worst dangerous."

The sales person will just plug it into the wall and say 'look, it works!'. Even the manufacturer replied to my email saying they should probably lengthen the isolation pad they have inside and that if the case was bent it would indeed pose a danger. Few properties in the Philippines have grounded sockets so that's why nothing has ground wires here."
electronics,394xfc,classicsat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:46:02 2015 UTC,"Ah I see. Funny the actual company basically told you ""yea, we cut some corners. Sorry"". That sucks about the lack of grounded sockets as well. I'd say either A: transplant want you have into a plastic case or B: return it and buy one that has a plastic case. Since getting an earth grounded one is probably not an option for you, one in a plastic case is probably a safer bet. That is assuming that a plastic one doesn't have some like exposed copper bars stuck extremely close to one another or something."
electronics,394xfc,classicsat,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:16:03 2015 UTC,"When you see a plug that has a third pin that goes to earth ground, that pin is always just connected to the case so that if some internal component carrying current touches the case on the inside, that current can just safely go to the ground through the cable instead of through your hand. It shouldn't be insulated it should be grounded...  That being said, a thin layer of paint won't offer enough resistance to insulate that kind of current anyway so yeah, do not plug that thing in."
electronics,394xfc,Borealisk,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:08:54 2015 UTC,"Depending on the paint, but id be willing to bet its the type of paint that will crack/crumble off if the case is bent.   The lack of earth is my main concern though."

electronics,394xfc,TechIsCool,2,Tue Jun 9 15:51:11 2015 UTC,What you can't see in this picture is that it uses an illuminated 'circuit breaker switch'. I think that's why they consider it to be surge protected.   I've since talked to the manufacturer and they said they're considering installing the isolation pad across the entire inside rather than just part of it.  Unfortunately homes in the Philippines very rarely have grounded sockets. That's why manufacturers don't bother with the ground wire anymore.

electronics,38z79d,eva_k,6,Mon Jun 8 11:29:30 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is just the amount of integration that each has. Many WiFi chips (not sure about the ESP8266) have integrated low noise amplifiers (for Rx), power amplifiers (for Tx), filtering, de/modulation, and baseband processing. At 10GHz, no one makes a single integrated solution for all of those so you have to roll your own.   Most of the RF voodoo in the board in the video is filtering - all those interdigital, coupled-line, and hairpin filters help to increase the overall signal integrity. There are existing easy to purchase high-performance RF amplifiers, but the majority of the design work is in matching networks & filtering."

electronics,38z79d,bradn,4,Mon Jun 8 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"I agree a major issue is integration level.  If everything but antenna can be done inside an IC, the IC can be designed to handle the signals.  Once you start looking at having external power amps, it gets weirder, and honestly I don't even know what they all did on this 10GHz link but I assume a lot of the problem was that they couldn't fabricate a lot of RF circuitry into their custom chips (maybe fab restrictions, maybe frequency too high, who knows).  Maybe a big issue is that their RX and TX aren't done on one IC, and maybe they had to come up with some bizarre RF echo cancellation or something.  I don't know enough about this stuff to say with any certainty though."
electronics,38z79d,cyan_and_magenta,3,Mon Jun 8 19:41:23 2015 UTC,Lot of the magic is filtering and tuning BS which honestly can be omitted in 2.4GHz since not a lot of people care about efficiency in WiFi.

I assume your real signal will be something proportional to a e2piF component so the higher the frequency the harder it will be to impedance match along your path without losing signal power. I guess a good way to think about it is that above a few MHz you are not dealing with eletron flow you are dealing with wave propagation that can resonate with the medium reflect from sharp angles and bounce back from terminations.

Waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an electromagnetic wave may be transmitted. Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass (the passband), while others are rejected (the stopband). Filters are a basic component of electronic engineering designs and have numerous applications. These include selection of signals and limitation of noise. Waveguide filters are most useful in the microwave band of frequencies, where they are a convenient size and have low loss. Examples of microwave filter use are found in satellite communications, telephone networks, and television broadcasting.    Image i - Figure 1. Waveguide post filter: a band-pass filter consisting of a length of WG15 (a standard waveguide size for X band use) divided into a row of five coupled resonant cavities by fences of three posts each. The ends of the posts can be seen protruding through the wall of the guide.

electronics,38z79d,autowikibot,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:25:21 2015 UTC,"Diplexer:       A diplexer is a passive device that implements frequency domain multiplexing. Two ports (e.g., L and H) are multiplexed onto a third port (e.g., S). The signals on ports L and H occupy disjoint frequency bands. Consequently, the signals on L and H can coexist on port S without interfering with each other.  Typically, the signal on port L will occupy a single low frequency band and the signal on port H will occupy a higher frequency band. In that situation, the diplexer consists of a lowpass filter connecting ports L and S and high pass filter connecting ports H and S. Ideally, all the signal power on port L is transferred to the S port and vice versa. All the signal power on port H is transferred to port S and vice versa. Ideally, the separation of the signals is complete. None of the low band signal is transferred from the S port to the H port. In the real world, some power will be lost, and some signal power will leak to the wrong port.  The diplexer, being a passive device, is reciprocal: the device itself doesn't have a notion of input or output.

electronics,392j5s,sigmaseven,2,Tue Jun 9 01:38:14 2015 UTC,"Rasters are still reasonably affordable at around $100-150 for most models of monitor, though you're usually accepting some degree of screen burn or a chassis board that requires new electrolytic caps at that price.   The Wells Gardner 6100 color vector monitor usually goes for around $400 in good working order, which is mainly because the low voltage portion of the chassis board is prone to failure which has made the parts scarce over the course of time.  The amplifone 25"" color vector monitor is the one worth serious amounts of cash. That's the monitor that originally came in the full upright versions of Tron and Star Wars and had similar issues to the WG 6100. Since demand is really high for those games and the monitors are so scarce it's not uncommon for a 25"" amplifone to sell for more than the game it's going to be installed into.

electronics,38via8,WildCheese,5,Sun Jun 7 18:33:17 2015 UTC,I backed a similar project on kickstarter! http://i.imgur.com/ZKWUIhU.jpg  I added the battery because they expected it to run from a usb tether and that was just irritating.
electronics,38via8,macegr,3,Sun Jun 7 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"We thought having a big battery on the side would be more irritating...however, your battery looks almost feasible. How many mAh is that cell and how many hours of runtime do you get? Might be possible to get a more compact form factor in Li-Poly."
electronics,38via8,WildCheese,3,Sun Jun 7 18:49:07 2015 UTC,"It's a ""2000mAh"" AA sized 14500 battery. I get about 4 to 6 hours of  runtime out of it depending on brightness. The other reason I added the battery instead of the tether is they wouldn't stay on my face. The extra weight seems to help a little with friction though I still can't look down without holding them. I understand these issues have been fixed in the final version?   I also cut circles of white vinyl on my vinyl cutter and individually placed them on each led as a diffuser. It's much easier for someone to look me in the eyes now and the colors blend more smoothly. Not really something feasible for large scale production but my partner was complaining about the points of light.   Edit: you should send business cards with these things, I always get questions about where I got them ;)"
electronics,38via8,macegr,3,Sun Jun 7 18:59:03 2015 UTC,"I've run some experiments with glass frosting spray (the kind that leaves a coating, not the kind that etches the glass!). It helps diffuse a bit, and won't hurt the PCBs. Your tactic also seems ideal, if tedious!  The new nose pads do help prevent sliding, but the only real way to make these adjustable-fit would be to have bendy earpieces. In the meantime, we've found that slipping some heatshrink over the earpieces really helps cushion the PCB edges while increasing friction a bit.  We've looked into using an AAA lithium ion battery, and trying to sink it into a PCB slot for the minimum possible profile. Still worried about battery life, and would probably need to add a boost converter. The round cells do seem to pack in more power these days than the soft Li-Poly ones, but those ""quote marks"" around your 2000mAh above are understood fully, the battery market competition is getting weird.  Thanks so much for the feedback!"

electronics,38wb5m,theartlav,5,Sun Jun 7 11:03:59 2015 UTC,What (exactly) causes the little metal striking sound we hear with each arc event ?
electronics,38wb5m,DoingIsLearning,3,Sun Jun 7 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"First one is not a continuous arc, but rather a lot of discharges - the capacitors charge up to above the breakdown voltage, it gets dumped into the arc with a crack, then the arc extinguishes while the capacitors gets charged back up again.  What you hear is that sparky sound deadened by the glass of the lamp, which ends up somewhat metallic.  With the long arc i think what happens is that the capacitors get charged back with higher voltage faster than the arc can extinguish itself, so a continuous arc is established, maintained by the impedance of the power supply. So there is only one bang at the start."
electronics,38wb5m,Samonellamiller,1 point,Sun Jun 7 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"What you hear is that sparky sound deadened by the glass of the lamp, which ends up somewhat metallic.   Yeah.

electronics,38yfc5,cogburnd02,2,Mon Jun 8 13:46:02 2015 UTC,"This is the original post, getting removed for some reason.  The idea started because we love small computers like the intel nuc and the rpi, but some are pretty expensive and the cheap ones feel a little underpowered. We wanted something in between so we started designing.  So we started looking for an embedded processor that could be our goldielocks zone, We settled for Freescale's i.MX6 because it is powerful (up to 1.2GHz Quad Core A9) and because it comes in pin compatible variats that will allow us to offer Single, Dual and Quad core variants.  But most importantly we think this processor has good open source and community support and it is increasing every day.  So back to the board, our focus is to squeeze the most performance we can get out of the platform, we noticed that some platforms don't do the necessary tweaks required to run things at full spee, but we have.   This is how our prototype looks so far featurewise:  Basic board:   Processor: i.MX6 Solo @ 1GHZ with  Vivante GC880/GC320 with 1080p30 encode/decode and dual 7200p encode PMIC to enable overclocking and advanced power management, plus RTC battery RAM: 512 MB DDR3 @ 1066 Wireless: Wifi 802.11 ac/a/b/g/n (max data rate is 866.7 Mbps, but SDIO 3.0 limit is 800 Mbps) BT 4.2 + LE NFC USB: 1 x USB 2.0 + 1 x USB OTG 2.0 Video: microHDMI 1.4 2 x microSD connectors with UHS-I support 3 Pin UART Debug header. 2 x 60 pin board to board connectors with RGB, PCIe, SATA, Audio-in, UART x 3, I2C x 2, SPI and 50+ GPIO. Power: 5VDC Price will be $59   The standard model has the same features and:   Adds a Dual Core i.MX6 (Same GPU) Has 1GB RAM Adds high quality audio codec and SPDIF out Adds 3 Axis Accelerometer, 3 Axis Magnetometer and 3 Axis Gyro Price will be $89   The Pro model has the same features and:   Adds a Quad Core Processor @ 1GHz with Vivante GC2000/GC355 Has 2 GB RAM Has an ultra silent (12dB) Heatsink and Fan to run the processor at full speed all the time. Price will be $129   Size will be 50 x 30 mm  We will support the basic distros, ubuntu, openelec, debian, etc. We plan on releasing a development image with compilers, editors, etc. the platform is powerful enough to compile its own programs (The Quad Core compiles Kodi w/ffmpeg in under two hours) and a multimedia oriented image with emulators and Kodi.  We are looking for opinions, and ideas on what you'd think could make this platform powerful for the DIY/Maker community, We are working on some killer apps, but we'd love to hear your thoughts.  Thank you. Edit: I'd love input on this questions:  Do you have one?  What are you using?   What do you use it for?  What shortcomings do you think it has?  What would you change of your platform?"

There is essentially no energy left in a disposable AA battery after it reaches 0.8V, so their claim that it functions down to 0.6V is stupid and manipulative.   For reference, look at this curve   The internal resistance of disposable batteries have a non-linear response to output voltage that affects efficiency and lifespan as the energy is depleted Switching boost converter ICs typically have a limited current output over which the efficiency would be high enough for the Batteriser to be worth it, and the Batteriser will likely not support output currents in excess of 2-300 mA The quiescent current draw of an always-boosting circuit may make very low current draw applications (10uA remote or sensor) will likely make the Batteriser reduce the lifespan significantly An inductor small enough to be utilized in the boost converter circuit within this device would be small enough that it wouldn't reach even maximum possible efficiency proported by the boost converter IC"

electronics,38om9x,Kickinthegonads,0,Wed Jun 10 08:21:14 2015 UTC,"I've coincidentally been running a battery experiment using a joule thief on a 1.5v Energizer battery (starting voltage 1.621v)  The LED and resistor I use would normally draw about 20mA from a battery, but run at 3v, requiring 2 AA batteries, and running for around 5 or 6 days in total.  Through the joule thief (similar, I am guessing the to guts of the device), I know that I can run the same LED down to 0.450mV (with a much larger current draw)... but since it basically consists of spikes of power (which can reach 5-12v) with a very short duty cycle, I can run off a single AA battery for some time.  As I use the thief in my own battery experiments (think edison cells), I decided to run an AA down and chart the voltages. I'm currently on day 10, and have made it down to 1.257v I think it will drop off quite quickly around 1.0 or 0.9v, but you can see I've easily doubled the servicable life span. At this point it has only dropped ~20mV per day, so I could possibly get 10 more servicable days out of this battery for the purposes of running an LED... so we're up to around 5X the service life.  I did not major engineering to make my thief, and it isn't particularly well made.. so I think 8X life for an LED is very possible with the data I have.  EXCEPT... I'm just making light, for a human, who can't see that it's not actually ""ON"" all the time. This is a very simple circuit and can easily handle the duty cycle. I have some concerns about running a microprocessor or similar toy with the device without damage.  ADDITIONALLY.. batteries can swell when they get very low voltage, and all sorts of nastiness can occur. I'd be cautious to drain one to the minimum voltage for my thief... or at least keep it on a glass plate in case of leakage."
electronics,38om9x,bigattichouse,-2,Wed Jun 10 08:50:40 2015 UTC,"I don't see why this is ridiculous.  Okay, if they're claiming 80% or 800% gain, and claiming devices shut off when a battery gets below 1.35V, those claims are wrong.  But the basic principle seems sound.  There is energy left in a nominal 1.5V alkaline battery even when it gets down to 1.0V.  There are solar-controllers today that somehow convert N volts at M amps to 1.5N volts at 0.6M amps, or some similar numbers.  I don't see why the same can't be done for a battery.  Maybe the electronics would be too expensive to make it feasible for small batteries."
electronics,38om9x,billdietrich1,6,Mon Jun 8 15:53:37 2015 UTC,"If you watch the video you'd know.   but fair enough the guy takes ages to explain it all:    batteries use about 80% of their capacity until they get to the ~1V at which most devices stop working a boost converter like this is at most 70-80% efficient, so any gain is already gone.    So the only way you could gain something with a boost converter is using it only after the battery is drained down to 1V, and then you'll get maybe 10-15% of the remaining 20% of energy that's left in there (boost converter efficiency drops off at lower voltage). However you'd have to take the empty batteries out, put this thing on and put them back. Not worth the effort for the maybe 10% you could save. Not to mention that this won't wotk at all for anything using a significant amount of power."
electronics,38om9x,_teslaTrooper,-2,Sat Jun 6 11:43:21 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info.  I don't quite see how you got from ""boost converter like this is at most 70-80% efficient"" to ""you'll get maybe 10-15% of the remaining energy"".  But maybe you're right, we'd get only 15% of 20% of initial capacity of a nominal 1.5V battery, in which case it's not worth it.  So the principle is sound but maybe the numbers don't work.  Maybe it would work better for a 9V alkaline battery, if the converter was 70% efficient at the higher voltages."
electronics,38om9x,billdietrich1,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:48:17 2015 UTC,"bit late replying to this, anyway: their premise is that you waste 80% of the energy in a battery, this is wrong, it's closer to 20%.   the reason you can't use this last 20% is the voltage drops too much  a boost converter would let you use that energy by boosting the voltage, but at 70% efficiency you get at most 14 of the 20 that was left, however a converter also has a cutoff voltage, not sure if it was mentioned but 0.6v is a generous estimate. in all likelihood you're getting under 10% of extra energy out of your battery if you're using a low power device, because it won't work at all for higher power devices.   and for this extra efficiency you have to wait for the batteries to run out before using this thing otherwise you end up with a net loss"

For this reason I tend to let my meter auto-off rather than turn it off with the mode dial (only do that if I know I won't be using it for days/weeks). Changing the battery a little more often is worth making the meter last longer.

electronics,38lpvq,dogetipbot,5,Fri Jun 5 13:32:23 2015 UTC,"Actually Fluke 87 doesn't shut off (pdf manual, page 87) in the min/max mode. Furthermore it is possible to disable auto poweroff in all the modes as well. If you hold the orange button (or blue on earlier models) when powering on the meter. Fluke 87 has a bunch of nifty Power On features like this.  This is what I love about the 87, I think it's the best hand held DMM ever made, next to their 8060A. Every time you think they screwed something up, they either did the right thing or there is a good [usually safety] reason for it. They aren't as good with their new lines of meters with data logging but the 87 is such a well designed piece of equipment, it'd be surprising if they screwed that up."

I used to use an old 87 at a job in the 90s. But then I didn't do electronics for awhile, been mainly doing software. And when I came back to electronics a year ago I bought a cheap $50 meter.

I think that's when I really got into electronics, having such a simple circuit that I built drive nice large, loud speakers. We soon figured out we could change the volume by replacing one of the resistors with a potentiometer, then quickly discovered what clipping was (the peak of your sine wave goes above the capacity of the amplifier), first really appreciated what an awesome tool an oscilloscope was cause it let us actually see the waveform and how as we increased the volume, the amplitude changed, and then how different degrees of clipping sounded to the ear...

electronics,38mij6,fddonald,5,Fri Jun 5 04:23:34 2015 UTC,"KiCad is the best imo. It's multi platform, the file format it uses is so easily scriptable and it's fairly full featured. It's supported by CERN.  It is not the most intuitive to get into, and it has some really dumb design decision which can throw you for a loop when you're first getting acquainted with it. Like adding a new footprint library is impossible to do from the foot print library editor from what I can tell. You have to do a few steps in a different module (eeschema). It also has graphical glitches which are easily overcome by just zooming or, refreshing CMD/CTRL-R.   But these are just learning pains you overcome fairly quickly. The keyboard shortcuts are well thought out and once you learn them you can start making schemas and PCBs really efficiently.  I'd say if you're first getting into PCB design commercial or free I would still pick KiCad."
electronics,38mij6,noiserr,4,Fri Jun 5 04:34:26 2015 UTC,"As I read the title I asked myself: How the f do they want to list 10 free EDA tools, there are not that many on the market.  And I was right, half of those listed are older than time itself and are more likely to not run on any modern computer.  And of course they did not listed the new interesting software like CircuitMaker."

It's a manual layout tool. It's up to you to route it to all the right pins. They have a schematic tool also, but I didn't find that useful.  You have pretty good control on routing and pad design. If you're doing a simple board, it works well.  It's limited to 2 layers or 4 layers, but the 4 layer option requires you to use 2 complete layers for power and ground, i.e. you can't have multiple power planes or other routes on the same layer.  If you want to spin up a simple board and get it in your hands quickly, it works fine. For a complex board, no."
electronics,38mij6,1wiseguy,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:31:22 2015 UTC,"Man I used Eagle just fine.  The freeware option was plenty ok with only the design size limitation.  I tried a few other options before coming back to Eagle simply because of the tutorial help that was available to get started with it.  My first project I ended up having to create a custom part and footprint for an RTC chip and thanks to the wide use of it, it went fine.  I think this is perfectly workable as a free option.  If you need more trace layers or a bigger PCB, then they probably deserve to have you buy their software."

electronics,38ej5h,Diastolic,2,Wed Jun 3 18:12:50 2015 UTC,Not what I was expecting... it seemed to contain a black 'plastic' piece surrounded by white balls. I was expecting to see some sort of metal filament.
electronics,38ej5h,deelowe,3,Wed Jun 3 18:14:55 2015 UTC,"The white balls are silica. The fuse is designed to fail at high temperature causing the silica to melt. This creates glass (an insulator) at the point of failure. Hopefully, this prevents arcing in the case where the power provided is well outside of specification. This type of fuse (HRC) is used in applications where a tremendous amount of current may be applied across it.  I assume the filament that's used is specifically designed to fail at a certain temperature that will allow the silica to melt and fuse. Maybe some sort of plastic is used for the carbon (thus creating a resistor and increasing in temperature as it fails)?"
electronics,38ej5h,dizekat,3,Wed Jun 3 18:47:25 2015 UTC,Molten glass is actually fairly conductive... but apparently pure silica isn't very conductive when molten.

electronics,38ej5h,deelowe,1 point,Fri Jun 5 00:25:01 2015 UTC,"So where would the glass be once melted? The black plastic stip that was extracted did not contain any remnants of anything melted too it. It  does look to have warped.   That fuse had in fact blown as it blew at 400ma when trying to put 700ma over it (Rookie mistake, always start with the 10A range oops)"
electronics,38ej5h,jimmyjo,2,Wed Jun 3 19:34:48 2015 UTC,"It only melts in an extremely high current situation. Otherwise, it acts as a normal fuse."

electronics,38ej5h,noiserr,4,Wed Jun 3 20:30:41 2015 UTC,"In a low power event, filament melts, circuit is broken, and the molten pieces solidify into smaller chunks due to surface tension. In a high power event, filament is vaporized, plasma is formed and is instantly quenched by the thermal mass of the silica sand.  Depending on the design of the filament, some have notched down sections(designed failure points), silica sand will turn to glass and solidify at these sites, holding the rest of the filament pieces apart. Preventing a conductive path from forming again."
electronics,38ej5h,Raxios,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"How long did it take to blow the fuse? I think it may have been a bit, since you weren't that far off the rated limit."

electronics,38hk1k,Soggy_Stargazer,6,Thu Jun 4 06:46:50 2015 UTC,"Most devices says they take a certain voltage, but actually takes a range. But it can be hard to figure out what the range is. The easiest solution is to look at what it's designed for, and you have a great clue in the battery pack.  AA says they are 1.2 or 1.5V, but as a rule of thumb they are more like 1-1.5V. When they are full, they are a bit more than 1.5V, and to use them fully the device should work all the way down to 1V.  So we know for certain the pump works with 9-12V, probably 8-12V.  12V SLA however can actually be over 14V right after they are charged. They quickly (minutes?) drop to just below 13V even when not in use, which will probably work. 14V will probably too, but there is a small risk of damage.  Another thing, if it's designed for NiMH batteries, it should stop working at 8V. Below 8V you will be damaging an NiMH battery pack. An SLA can't go that low, I wouldn't go below 11V. I would add some kind of battery protection to make sure this doesn't happen, to protect the battery.  If you say why you want to do this, we may be able to give you a better suggestion."

The 901s always came with the equalizer box, too.  So I'm not sure why Bose would want it back, unless it might have been a prototype that made its way out of the lab.  This is a nice layout and appears to be well made.  Looks like someone has already dropped a new set of Orange Drops and other caps in there.  Thing is, I would have taken the opportunity to ditch all of those old carbon comp resistors.  I've been restoring old radios and building gear since 1998.  Often, I'll put carbon comp resistors on the meter.  I've yanked hundreds of them and have yet to find one that was still in spec.  They get hot, they get old and they drift like the wind.    And resistors are cheap.  As long as I have something open, I replace all carbon comp resistors with metal film or wirewound.  I usually go to 5% or better on tolerance and double the rating, as well.  It only costs a few more dollars, and old gear really shapes up with precision resistors."

electronics,38eamg,DaVitruvian,3,Wed Jun 3 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"I will start by saying, you likely will be better off with an enclosed general purpose motor from Harbor Freight or the like. It will have standard plate mounts, enclosed connection box, a wiring diagram, and standard shaft to accept a standard pulley.  But my gleaning of the available schematics, and intermediate knowledge of electric motors produces the following:  The terminal with white is the Neutral,which goes into a thermal protector. The protector connects to the run return, and a White with Black stripe wire.  Blue is High speed, Violet Low speed, but low speed goes through a centrifugal switch (closed when running, open when stopped) which ensures the motor starts in high speed first.  Yellow and Black are the start winding leads. Yellow also goes through the centrifugal switch (closed when stopped, open when running), and then through the start capacitor. That connects to your supply hot with the Blue lead, and White/Black terminal Which start lead(other capacitor terminal, Black) connects to hot or neutral, determines start direction."
electronics,38eamg,classicsat,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:23:14 2015 UTC,"This is perfect. I got it to run, but wasn't a 100% sure if I was doing it correctly.   As for the start leads, do i just run that in parallel with either the low or high speed leads? Also what js the function of the black and white wire?   Edit: Basically can you tell me how I should wire it up to run high speed and low speed properly with a stripped 120 vac plug?"
electronics,38eamg,classicsat,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:32:13 2015 UTC,"Really just the High speed, since you start it in high, then switch power from High to Low.

electronics,38dc9c,cyan_and_magenta,3,Wed Jun 3 15:42:57 2015 UTC,"Fluke designs in quality and safety first and features last. This is why you can't go wrong with a Fluke. With that said their lower end models are a bit Spartan. Like having a bargraph is really useful to notice quick flutter in what you're measuring ( since it updates much quicker than the number reading), also I would really try and get a meter with the min max feature. I find it indispensible especially if you don't own a scope. You can leave a meter in min max mode for hours and you can catch glitches that way.  If you can stretch your budget get a 115 or one of the 170 series meters or even better one of the 80s, 87-V being the best.   There are ton of these on EBay new and used and you can probably score an 83 for a similar price as the 15b+.   A good Fluke multimeter is going to last you forever, meters don't really become outdated, I have an 8060A on my desk, it was built in 1985 and works like a charm. This is why I think it's worth spending a little extra for those few really useful features.   Also keep in mind if you're serious about electronics you want 2 meters. To measure multiple things at once and to double check and cross reference between them."
electronics,38dc9c,noiserr,2,Fri Jun 5 06:52:32 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree! I own a 25, 27FM and 8025B (basically all the same meters except the 27FM is true RMS and the 25 is missing rel and min/max capability) and they are excellent meters. Built like a brick (drop proof to 1m (although I don't doubt they could survive 5), water- and oiltight and I mean to recall they have 1000 hours of battery life) and they come with an extra mA and uA range fuse in series with the ""fancy"" fuse (so you don't have to swap out the expensive Bussman fuse if you mess up).  I picked them up for around 40 USD each on ebay. Unless you really need/want capacitance and frequency measurement capability I would highly recommend one of those models if you can find one for cheap on the 'bay. Plus they have touch hold, whereas the Chinese made Flukes do not (very handy).  The fact that mine are easily 20/30 years old proves they'll last you forever. That and the fact that most sold on ebay come from government surplus and have been through calibration (it has usually expired by two years or so though but I found all three to be well within spec). Oh yes and they have excellent accuracy specs (0.1%+1 basic accuracy).  It's probably quite clear I love these meters so I apologise for my rambling. Hope this helps anyone."
electronics,38dc9c,Aars_Man_Tiny,2,Sat Jun 6 18:34:44 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind buying a Chinese meter I would recommend the Uni-T UT61E. It has a 22000 count display at 2 updates/s (which is a bit slow, sadly) and incredible accuracies for the price (about 60 USD). Mjlorton has a video up on youtube of the meter still being well within spec a year after purchase and an extensive review.  It's a great little multifunction meter for the price and built sturdily and to decent safety standards as well. It was either missing PTCs or MOVs on the input protection circuitry but does have HRC fuses.  I own it and really like it. But of course a Fluke will always be a safe bet overy (almost) any other brand as they simply don't die."
electronics,38dc9c,Aars_Man_Tiny,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:45:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I personally own tons of meters. Bunch of flukes, 2x 87V, 83, 8060A, 8062A, 27 (industrial brick of a meter). And I also own the little UNI-T UT61E. I got it mainly for data logging which comes standard for dirt cheap.   Now it is by no means a Fluke, I would not go pocking around mains with it, as the ratings on it are fake. It is not true Cat III and definitely not Cat IV rated. However for low current and voltage electronics, it is not bad at all for $50.   Especially for someone on a budget it is not a bad little meter. Get a Fluke and a 61E and you'll be fine. Just keep in mind while 61E is decent, UNI-T makes quite a bit of bad meters, so definitely don't just get any UNI-T. They vary in quality and safety greatly.   For instance they even sell unfused meters, which are death traps."

The idea is that the computer has to be able to parse every character and understand what you mean by it.  If you started with just a letter, then the compiler might think you were giving a variable name, not a constant number.  For octal, just use a leading zero:  0377 == 0xFF == decimal 255.

electronics,38d4o6,balducien,6,Wed Jun 3 22:16:58 2015 UTC,"Hex representation is important for any programming, period.  Sometimes with bitwise operations or ""flags"" it's easier to write out the binary to understand what's being fiddled with.  When dealing with non-printable characters, a binary-aligned base is nice in that multiple bytes can be represented evenly, eg 'Hi' or characters 72 and 105 can't efficiently run together in decimal as 072105 because what of that ""105"" what about the values from 2xx through 9xx that will never get used in decimal notation?  That's a lot of numbers we're just tossing out.  In an 8-bit byte/character system if we evenly divide the bits into, say 4 bit chunks (nibbles) we need 16 values to represent each chunk of bits - 72 and 105 convert to x48 and x69 which we can run together as 4869 nicely and not waste any bit space of the potential 0-255 value range.  A preceding 0 is pointless when writing numbers, so it's instead used to denote a change in base notation (deviation from human-standard decimal system, base-10).  A plain 0 means the following digits are to be Octal, or base-8 (3 bits/digit).  If the next digit is ""x"", then the next digits are heXidecimal (hex=6+dec=10, base 16, 4 bits/digit aka 1 ""nibble""/digit).  If it's a ""b"" then the following are individual Bits (bi=2, base 2, 1 bit/digit).    Human's base 10 does not translate cleanly into binary, eg the maximum digit is 9, in binary is ""1001"" and there are unset bits which means there is potential room for data we're ignoring and we can't just take each decimal digit and output binary, we have to keep adding them up until they reach the next power of 2 (binary compatible base) - 16 before we can output any binary and not be wasting any bits.  Octal max is 7, or ""111"".  Hex max is F, or ""1111"", etc.  They run together nicely."
electronics,38d4o6,balducien,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:55:16 2015 UTC,To answer your second question:  We write it as 0x4455whatever because that's the way to represent hexadecimal numbers in C (and derived) languages.  Like so:  int *address = 0xE0FF4008

A mobile print head with no frame: To have any sort of respectable final prints, you will need to be able to position the print head with an accuracy on the order of micrometers, repeatably. GPS' accuracy is on the order of meters (~7-8 orders of magnitude too inaccurate), sonar might get you centimeter resolution (still 2-4 orders of magnitude too inaccurate), and other methods will probably be altered by the print itself, as it progresses. Even using stepper motors for the drive wheels only works if you're on a perfectly flat and rigid work surface, and there's no wind to push the print head off-course.  Sintering: melting metal takes a TON of energy. Either your mobile print head is going to be dragging around a bundle of heavy power wires, or probably be immobilized by the sheer weight of batteries it would have to carry.

electronics,38dfum,krixen,5,Wed Jun 3 14:28:08 2015 UTC,"<< and >> are usually referred to as bitwise shifts.  So if you had a binary number 0b0000 1111 and you called it x,  and if you did:  int y = x << 2;   y would have a value of 0b0011 1100. Noticed it ""moved"" by 2.  By the way, bit shifting left by n is equivalent to multiplication by 2n in decimal, and bit shifting right is division by that.  These are mildly useful depending on what kind of thing you're using the binary number for. Usually for counting things, decimal works better so we don't usually use binary, but sometimes we want to use binary for certain things.   One thing you can use binary is using it to store a bunch of true-false ideas into one data. It's like using an array but more low level.  Let's say you had a binary number 0b0000. Let's say the nth digit of the binary number means whether the nth LED is on or off. Lets say this number is stored in led.  Now, to turn on the 3rd LED, you'd say:  led = 0b1000  this turns off all the other LEDs. What if you wanted to leave them the original state, but only change the 3rd one to be on?  Then you can do:  led = led | 0b1000  | is the bitwise OR. It does a boolean OR operation on each digit of the left hand side number and the right hand side number. So if led originally had 1 in the 2nd digit, the result of the OR operation will still be 1.   Now, you want to see if the 2nd LED is on. How would you do it?  led2on = led & 0b0100  & is the logical AND. It's like | except for ANDs. If you do a similar analysis, you'll know that if LED has the 2nd bit as 1, the result led2on will carry a result of 0b0100, and 0b0000 otherwise. Note that in C and C++ and most other languages, a numerical value of 0 means ""false"" and 1 means ""true"".  Let me know if you have more questions."

Now when you use the <<=3, does it always get rid of the TOP 3 (MSB 3)?  edit: Now I am getting it, the command for sending data from pin 0 on this ADC is, 11000XXXXXXXXXXXX. So he created the 0b00011000, threw out the top 3, 0b11000, then shifted by 8, 1100000000000, although that is still short.   Why could he not just have written a 5bit command and just set it.

electronics,38dfum,cyan_and_magenta,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:32:24 2015 UTC,"Well it might be that the ADC only looks at the top 5 MSBs of an 8 bit word so you might be ""required"" to pad it to the 8 bits.  0b1 0101 == 0b0001 0101 =/= 0b1010 1000  The ADC wants 0b1010 1000 and if you feed it 0b1 0101 it interprets it as 0b0001 0101 and probably shits the bed."

If its a low you just do nothing and get a 0b10. After you iterate again you just shift over to get 0b110 and continue till you get your ADC value.  Is this correct?"

The book was central to the development and popularization of the C programming language and is still widely read and used today.

electronics,38d06u,thebluemonkey,2,Wed Jun 3 12:39:32 2015 UTC,"An easy way to think about it is with ohm's law: V=IR and the related P=IV. In this case the Voltage (V) potential is very small and the current (I) potential is very large. The amount of power (P) in each case depends on the resistance (R). A screw driver or hacksaw blade has a very low resistance, so it allows both V and I to go up to their maximum potentials. In this case, V can't go very high, but the current can, so a massive amount of power ends up passing through the metal.  In the case of when he uses his hand, the human body has a moderate resistance. The electricity will have to travel a long way through his body (up one arm, across his torso, then back down the other arm) and thus the resistance goes up. Since the voltage can't go higher then 1 or 2 volts, this limits the current because the resistance is large (think I=V/R), so not much power can travel through his body. However, if the voltage were not limited by the setup he's using, he could easily die.  In regards to your other question about what voltage and current do respectively, think of it as water: voltage = pressure, current = volume of moving water. A transformer is like a narrow point in a river, the pressure of the water increase and the water starts moving much more quickly, but the amount of water in the gap is smaller then at a wider point in the same river. So, voltage goes up, current goes down, power stays the same. This is a step up transformer. Conversely if the river enters a wide point the river slows down and the amount of water at that point goes up. Voltage went down, current went up, power stayed the same. This is a step down transformer.  Finally, another word on the difference between voltage and current: voltage allows electricity to flow. Think of those little plasma balls that you can buy at a novelty store or a Jacob's ladder from sci-fi movies, here the voltage is very very high, so high in fact that it ionizes a path through the air so that the current can flow between the two electrodes. This is what lighting does, it has a very high voltage so it creates a massive spark. Current is what does the damage to your body. Think of static electricity: you've been running around in wool sock on your grandparent's shag carpet all day and then you touch a door knob or an unsuspecting bystander. There's a spark and it stings. The spark was a few thousand volts, but it didn't do any damage because there was only a few milliamps. Increase the current however, and you could have gotten a burn or worse.  I hope that helps you understand :)"

Our boat had a prototype noise cancelling system that had been busted for several months and abandoned in place (no repair parts). Our newly qualified ETMS graduate was given the offending card and told to troubleshoot it. He was good buddies with some of the electricians and somehow they convinced him to let them megger it to see if there were any shorts on the card.   Suffice it to say, he was never allowed to troubleshoot anything again (at least while I was there) and he pretty much assured that we would never ever get that stupid thing to work again since there were no replacement cards and he thoroughly fried any working component on the board."

electronics,387nw4,PointyOintment,3,Tue Jun 2 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"In addition to what everyone else has said:   Brush up on the theory, not necessarily before you start building, but early on. And continue to learn it. Don't be afraid of failure. Fail early rather than late—it's better to fail before you've spent much money and time building the thing that ends up failing. Then you can start your second attempt, knowing what you do after your failed first attempt, sooner. Know the internal layout of a breadboard. I've seen some questions on here where the only problem the person had was misunderstanding how to use a breadboard. (If you like using breadboards, or like breadboards except for the fact that they're physical objects, check out Fritzing too.) Important: Don't check voltage with your multimeter set to current or resistance. Also make sure the probes are plugged into the voltage socket and common, if your multimeter has separate sockets for current vs. voltage & resistance! See Matt's comment for why. If it's a high-quality meter, doing this wrong will blow a fuse at worst, but if it's not, it could blow up the meter. (I think mjlorton on YouTube posted a video of a test at Fluke's lab showing the difference recently.) Also, don't use your multimeter or multimeter probes on voltages higher than they're rated for. Be careful when pulling chips out of breadboards. If you use your fingers, the legs might get jammed into your fingertip. If you use a chip puller tool without a locking device/thumbscrew on it, it will slip and maybe damage the chip. Prying with a screwdriver works well if you make sure to keep it level. Bonus tip: Never use tantalum capacitors unless you're absolutely sure you need to. They blow up violently and flamefully when exposed to even small overvoltages. Other capacitor types are much safer. If you're building circuits from older designs, you may find that they specify tantalum caps, because they have qualities that weren't available in other types at the time. Check with /r/AskElectronics to see what kinds of modern capacitors to substitute. And if you really must use a tantalum cap, derate its voltage a lot. (In other words, use one with a voltage rating at least 1.5×, preferably 2× or more, the maximum peak voltage you expect it will ever see.)"

If you are about to measure current and you didn't have to disconnect something, chances are you're about to blow up your multimeter.   OPEN the circuit and INSERT your meter when measuring current.  Also, a multimeter set to measure Current is a dead short, I.E. just a piece of wire. That's why you insert it into some other wire, where it continues to act as a wire (zero voltage across it). If you measure it anywhere there's voltage, for example, across a power rail or a battery, you've just shorted it and probably dun gone and blowed it all up."

Make them about 0.25mm in width. Make the tracks for the power-supply thicker than the normal tracks, to reduce the sag in voltage from current spikes.  Placment is key! Place the components near to the chip to reduce board size and potential for cross coupling. The capacitor looks very odd, because it is so far away from the rest. You can rotate R3 90° and put it on the left side of the board, above the NE555.  Espacially with THT designs you can route tracks between the pads of components, for example your resistors.  Increase the clearances between the tracks and the pads if you plan to make the PCBs yourself.  Think of mounting-points. Holes to screw the PCB to something or pin-headers to plug it into a proto-board. You can also put a potentiomenter on there and connect it where R2 and R1 are connected, so you can decide later if you want the potentiometer to controll the frequency or use the resistors to have a fixed frequency. This cost you nothing extra in production and expands the usability of the product. Perhaps add a MOSFET in a open-drain configuration to the output and add another connector to the board, to be able to switch external loads."

Also, I suggest the following changes: Move the capacitor to be right next to the pin of the 555 that it's connected to. You have a ground plane, so no reason to put it anywhere else. Move R1 to the right. Move R2 to the left. (Swap their positions.) Maybe even put R1 right below the LED. That will allow their traces to be routed more sensibly."
electronics,388ccb,edison517,5,Wed Jun 3 07:49:28 2015 UTC,"Cloidnerux had a lot of good input. I would add that when I make a pcb, I like to route the traces as far away as possible from other pins, while still maintaining a nice look. for example, I would reroute the 555 pins 3 & 4 so that the traces aren't nearly as close as they are. and I wouldn't route pin 8 through 1 & 2, especially since pin 1 is a ground; being that close is just begging for a short. You have to take into account the board house that makes this pcb; there can be errors in the process which could lead to shorts/opens. Making the traces as big as possible isn't going to hurt anything, besides limit routing possibilities... You may want to verify the resistor footprints; unless you're using 1/8 watt resistors, 1/4"" may not fit unless you install them vertically. And this doesn't have anything to do with the pcb design, but I would suggest a DIP8 socket for the 555; makes it much much easier to replace in case it blows up ;)"

I also just noticed that you only did a copper fill on the bottom (ground). any reason why you didn't put a copper pour on the top and assign it to 5v? I recently learned that having a top/bottom power/ground copper pours makes for good capacitance.

The only reason I based it off that design is because the fan controller seems to be keeping my battery desulfated. The main difference is that I replaced the fan with a big inductor and ran it at a much higher frequency. I haven't tested the desulfator design for any length of time, but the high voltage spikes, and the inductor ""ring"" that it produces do show up across an oscilloscope on a good battery. Another thing to mention, if you want those volatge spikes to really go to the battery and not to any other circuit then you must have a protection diode in series with your charger and NOTHING else connected to the battery aside from the charger and desulfator."

The megafunction wizards are kind of shit, but are passable, I guess. The various flows don't seem to pick up on external file changes very reliably and there's a ridiculous ""are you sure you want to execute this task again?"" dialogue I can't seem to get rid of.  What does Quartus get right? I can do damn near everything from the command line. I don't have to use their craptastic GUI. :-)  They haven't decided to just integrate Eclipse (yet?). Timequest and SignalTap are both great, although the latter would really do good to be able to be driven without a GUI (i.e. let people write to an API to be able to do all the things from remote or with better/different visuals).  As you can see... no real showstoppers. I try to avoid QSys but I hear it's a big step up from SOPC Builder.

Let's say as a wild example, the inner loop of you application is a Markov chain lookup. If you can grab the CPU facilities at the microcode level and make your hottest loop a single instruction... This is going to be worth some effort to implement. Notice the specialization of instructions available in recent instruction sets, which are tailored for specific video comression routines, etc. I dare say there's room for space on a CPU to make your own instructions."

IIRC their last generation product was built out of Xeons and Xilinx parts, one of their earlier generation designs stuck FPGAs into Hypertransport sockets as peers to Opterons.  Their tech was all pretty neat from a technical standpoint.   Basically, that kind of accelerator is an enormous pain in the ass to set up and program against, and subject to many of the same memory bandwidth and latency constraints as GPUs.  The latter point is what the whole industry is scrambling on at the moment, you can throw programmers at awful toolchains, but no one can feed their accelerators, hence HSA, HMC, and a number of other TLAs starting with ""Hybrid"" that are all about cheating the Von Neumann bottleneck."

The worst part of it would be the integration between FPGA chunks and the rest of the code on the CPU, and I imagine there could be a lot of security gotcha's involved until it is well developed, depending on the hardware architecture."

Budget: moderate        Skills: Intermediate Audio  Build a simple multi-channel sound board.  When looking for ideas keep it simple; there are enthusiast sound boards that are both complicated and expensive to build.  You want to avoid those at this point.  A sound board with 2 channels, a mixer, volume control, maybe a high filter and low filter would make suitable project.   Budget: High       Skills: low to moderate  You could make custom functions for an RC vehicle.

At best, it will give some more battery life for voltage sensitive devices that don't have a built in regulator.  That's not really a large list, and it would have to be very cheap to justify that.  And, unless I miss something, it will cause a small, but continuous, battery draw even when the device is off [assuming a conventional boost converter, equal to the leakage current of the storage capacitor, plus running the controller].

Here's your first stop: http://www.carvinmuseum.com/techdocs.html  Jumpering across a resistor in a power circuit is generally unwise. If it burned, there's a reason, and shorting across it is like jumpering a fuse: the other components will then tell you what's out of whack by failing.  Resistors are cheap; semiconductors and tubes, not so much.   Find the resistor on the schematic; get at least two replacements and put one in. If it dies, the problem is not the resistor."

Solid-state amps have lower rail voltages (+/-85V, I seem to recall seeing in some Peavey schematics) with a lot more current.

electronics,3845bi,mudclub,3,Mon Jun 1 18:54:18 2015 UTC,"Yep.  There are other factors which get complicated, but what it works out to is that the more power you draw from the battery, the less will be available overall - there's a formula/constant for determining that, but ultimately, if you're running super low resistance coils, your battery will be able to provide fewer Ah than if you are running higher resistance coils.  How on earth did you get stuck with tiny little batteries like that?  Typical 18650s (presumably twice the length of the minis I assume you're using) tend to be good for about 2250mAh."

I could use that device for 1 hour and at the end of the hour i would have 1.5W remaining in the source?   That 1.5W/1500mah would power the device for 30 mins (@full power)?  If i am right what is the formula for determine the length of usage? It is simple enough to do for easy figures but for the more complex ones it wont be. I am guessing you divide capacity of the source by the watt hour/mah?  Thanks again for taking the time.
electronics,3845bi,mudclub,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"In the first case, I'd expect you could get 3 hours out of it.  4500mAh/1500mAh = 3.  At the end of the hour, you'd have half the battery capacity available, or 2250mAh.  Put another way, a device running at 4.5A at 2V will consume 9Watts.

I design analog ICs and because I do it all day at work playing around with board level stuff is the last thing I want to do in my free time.  There is a lot of information out there but as it is a form of engineering there is no real single instruction manual that will tell you how to do everything or where all the pitfalls are.  A small tip to get you started: 90% of the time a problem with an existing design is with the power supply somehow.

Believe me when I say I had VERY little real understanding of electricity. Even if college didn't provide me with a degree in electrical engineering, it did teach me how to learn, and that's all a person really needs. Just like you I started by opening up broken electronics and looking around (also sniffing around, trust your nose). I put an ad on craigslist asking for people's broken electronics and I even went to my town's recycling drop-off facility and smuggled out whatever I could. Once you learn all the basic components (resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transformers, the almighty transistors, etc.) which can be as easy as a youTube/wikipedia search, you can build a simple guitar distortion pedal  right away!! It's really easy to get caught up in learning electronic theory (you could spend a lifetime trying to understand where the electrons are actually coming from and going to) but you gotta periodically remind yourself what it is you want to get out of learning electronics and move toward that. I have an ever-growing list of bookmarked web pages which I'm sure you will soon have, too. Aside from this subreddit's wiki page for beginners, some resources that helped me are this table of acronyms so you can understand what the hell people mean when they say things like PSU, VCC, VAC, etc., the best explanations of electricity I've come across, and a circuit simulator applet which helped me understand a lot through visualization. Good luck and don't give up!!"

electronics,37zs51,dizekat,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:18:34 2015 UTC,So it is a crystal oscillator? What are it's applications?
electronics,37zs51,rfdave,13,Sun May 31 20:05:03 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a crystal that goes into an oscillator circuit. You need gain and feedback to make it actually oscillate. Look for Pierce or Colpitts oscillator designs for circuit designs.   It's also not at 145.12 MHz, which the labeling would seem to indicate. This plugs into a radio to serve as the Local Oscillator to receive 145.12 MHz, but the actual crystal frequency is probably below 10 Mhz, based on the size and connections."
electronics,37zs51,odokemono,3,Sun May 31 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"I'm finding hits for ""145.18 crystal repeater"" that seem to indicate that was a well known frequency in the 2 meter band."

electronics,37zs51,MaskedEngineer,18,Sun May 31 21:32:20 2015 UTC,With only two contacts that is almost certainly just the raw crystal.  You would need an external circuit to build an oscillator from it.  Crystals are used any time you need an accurate and stable frequency source.

electronics,37zs51,fastbiter,2,Sun May 31 23:51:51 2015 UTC,The physical size of the crystal is an indicator of when it was produced and I think that's what I saw originally. The Drake crystals are a size or two up from the one shown in the picture. The size crystal used was probably from the 1970s CB Era. but it was a mixer intermediate frequency for a 2 meter HAM unit.

electronics,37zs51,lanmanager,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:00:20 2015 UTC,Oh wow that is very neat. I have about ten of those old vacuum tubes and a couple tuners. I am wondering if I have enough to make a simple FM radio.
electronics,37zs51,DangerousBill,1 point,Wed Jun 3 00:00:15 2015 UTC,"That depends on the tubes.  Tubes have a variety of uses and not all of them are for radio.  You'll find a lot of old television tubes out there, which are very common.  You will also see quite a few audio amplification tubes.  FM tubes aren't as common, though you can find them at Antique Electronic Supply and other tube vendors.  FM radios weren't tubed for very long.  The FM frequency range changed after WWII and there weren't any multiplex (or stereo) FM tuners until around 1959.  By 1961 or so, manufacturing changed to transistors.  You would also need to get some tuning capacitors for the circuit.  FM is a little tricky - you will need an oscilloscope to align the circuit.  Plus tubes need a high voltage power supply, so you'll have to be comfortable working with that.  The transformers for the power supply and tuning capacitors can run you a couple hundred, as well.  If you want to work on a radio, I'd recommend picking up an old ""All American Five"" AM set on eBay or at a thrift store.  Those are pretty easy to understand and restore.  From there, you might want to tinker with some of the multiband AM receivers.  I really like those, especially the old boatanchors.  Some years back, I bought an old H.H. Scott 350B FM receiver.  Those are multiplex and entirely tubed.  It's a wonderful set, and you would probably be better off restoring something like that than building one.  It would cost less, for one.  Though the tricky part would be designing and building a chassis.  Lots of holes and you have to be careful with circuit layout to minimize interference."

electronics,380wbk,loopyroberts,1 point,Mon Jun 1 01:53:45 2015 UTC,"I concur. One possibility would be to use both secondaries in series aswell, that way you can symmetrically load the transformers."

electronics,380wbk,lihaarp,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:20:06 2015 UTC,What happens if the secondaries are in series and you actually want 24v? For curiosities sake.
electronics,380wbk,alectronics,1 point,Mon Jun 1 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"If you want 24V from 220V, just use one transformer - using two transformers with primaries and secondaries wired in series is possible but the load sharing is less controlled and more determined by the construction of the transformers.  If you want 24V from 110V, wire the primaries in parallel and secondaries in series."
electronics,380wbk,tip120,2,Tue Jun 2 17:13:00 2015 UTC,"Doing this will destroy your equipment.  A transfomer is basically two coils of wire close to each other. The number of turns in each (known as the turns ratio) determines the voltage on each side. If the turns are equal, then the voltage on either side is the same. The current also scales in this, but that wouldn't really be causing problems because your load draws the current it needs. Voltage is the issue here.  When you put 2 identical transformers in series, you are essentially creating a really big transformer with the same turns ratio, or alternatively a center-tapped transformer with half the turns ratio. The turns ratio is decided by the input you have and the output you need and can't really be changed unless you swap out the transformer."
electronics,380wbk,caustictoast,0,Mon Jun 1 02:09:05 2015 UTC,"You could do this.. barely, if the transformers are centre tapped secondaries, and have very large secondary windings.  Lets say you had 2 identical transformers, 110v to 12 volt center tapped.  To convert 240 volt to 110, you would wire them back to back so that the first transformer drops down to 24 volt center tapped. You wire up half of that winding (12volts) to the 12 volt winding on the second transformer, which then boosts its back up to 110 volts.  Not ideal though and fairly lossy."
electronics,382jjw,perskes,2,Mon Jun 1 11:46:32 2015 UTC,"That style of SMT LEDs is generally cooled by conducting heat into the the PCB pads through the leads. You can make the pads big, but there's only so much you can do with that, so these devices are limited to moderate power.  They make SMT LEDs (e.g. the OSLON series from OSRAM) that have a thermal slug on the bottom that can conduct watts of heat into a board, and it's common to use thermal vias or metal-substrate boards to accommodate the heat."

electronics,382jjw,TurnbullFL,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:20:45 2015 UTC,"While an LED can generally work at 150 C, they have really short lifetimes. You need to keep the die temperature to maybe 100 C or less if you want to get a long life.  Whether you use PWM or not, it's the die temperature that's the issue, and that's a function of average current, which is also what determines brightness. So it doesn't make much difference whether you run an LED at 1A with a 50% duty cycle, or 500 mA DC.  If you want to get into details, you should get data sheets and app notes for the parts in question and read up on this stuff."

Which is nice because the explanation is simple.  CE introduces a zero into the amplifier's transfer function at radian frequency omega_1, and also introduces a pole at radian frequency omega_2.  Since omega_1 < omega_2, this has the effect of increasing the amplifier gain at high frequencies (those above omega_1)  If you find yourself wanting high gain but perhaps not all the way down to DC, this circuit trick may help.  Split the emitter resistor into two series pieces and bypass the midpoint to ground using a capacitor CE."

Another common problem is for the probes to get separated from the scope, thus prohibiting the option of testing.  All you need to test most of the functionality of any scope is a $10 probe.  The older Teks were lab grade equipment and even models from the 1970s such as the 465 are still highly sought after.  The 2465 from the 1980s is considered the holy grail of CROs and it is not at all uncommon to find these on CL for under $100.  I picked up two 1950s vintage Tek 531s just to scrap them for their CRTs and both were in perfect working order.  So much so that I couldn't bring myself to tear them apart.  (The analog bandwidth on these 1950's scopes is far superior to most pocket DSOs, BTW.)  The only real problem with older Tek scopes are the capacitors.  The tantalum caps that Tek used in the 1980s are notorious for failing.  That's a quick and easy fix.  Semiconductors rarely fail.  The biggest problem there are the ASICs on the 80s vintage scopes.  Finally, there is a huge community of people repairing and restoring older Tek scopes.  You can get service manuals and assistance for just about all of them."

electronics,37pp4d,Nembus,2,Fri May 29 14:22:49 2015 UTC,I don't think you can charge a battery and use it at the same time but what you could if the solar panel can supply enough power is just run the battery charge in parallel with the load. Of course with this you would require a buck converter to step down the voltage to 5V assuming that the solar panel outputs 12-18V.

electronics,37pp4d,kilroy232,1 point,Fri May 29 21:39:39 2015 UTC,I use an LM2903 with a zener refrence to allow the main capacitor to charge to about 15v. When the voltage exceeds this threshold the comparator turns on a MOSFET switch to discharge the contents of the cap through an LM317 and into the battery. The comparator uses hysteresis to allow the capacitor to discharge down to 10v before shutting off the MOSFET and allowing the cap to charge again. The 5v sswitching regulator is taken directly from the battery so it's input will see the voltage used to charge the battery. The regulator will output 5v while the battery is charging however only sporadically as a result of the controlled discharges. This obviously detracts current from the the main battery and slows the charging.

But in the end I think I am going to go with single color LED matrix.  They are a bit of a pain to drive (lots of pins) but I got it sorted. I am thinking of potentially mass producing the clock and really LEDs (matrix or 7-seg) are the cheapest and the longest lasting tech. Nixie tubes and VFDs look the best though."

I asked him what the future for the rpi was after Broadcom shut down their mobile division (last year I think?) and he said if anything its beneficial because a lot of that talent on the team (and they were a good group) were hired by raspberrypi.

It's a complex issue and releasing the source can open you up to a whole slew of patent lawsuits from trolls.  It's likely that with the abundance of low-power media devices like chromecast, roku, the amazon thing (and of course mobile phones), that this will only get better (as in the rpi performance and cost).  The chip for the original raspberry pi was designed to be a GPU for a nokia phone but nokia pulled out at the last minute. The engineers had (without nokia knowing) put an ARM core on the chip (something like 2mm2 of a 60mm2 chip) so some people had the bright idea of not letting this go to waste and just use it for something, and this is the rpi."

Well, it's less about ""giving the CPU X using FPGAs"", since FPGAs are still quite a bit slower than CPUs and so you have to use them as parallel accelerators for it to make sense. But runtime reconfigurable pipelines, FPGA and GPU accelerators are in the works.  For highly specialised tasks some of this stuff is already being tried in industry, but the challenge is how to actually program the damn things. The average developer can't even write efficient multithreaded code on CPUs.  Check out the Zynq SoC linked by /u/rcxdude for hardware that has been available for a while.

Sure, you'll have small pockets of well-trained individuals that have developed the tools their entire careers, but broadening the horizons of comp-sci students today will allow a much wider base for innovation.  Small pockets of smart people can produce a lot of awesome, but even they're limited in what their imaginations can devise...opening the doors as wide as possible to let the fresh blood in is necessary;  limited adoption will stagnate the industry."

electronics,37q1oz,CommanderBC,2,Fri May 29 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"In most cases all you will need to do is replace the capacitors and these radios will work just fine.  The biggest problem comes when you try to power up these old radios with degraded capacitors as this will often result in damaged tubes.  If this unit only takes battery power, there is less of a chance that someone did this at some point since the caps aged.  The best way to fire these units up is with a bench power supply that provides current limiting on all rails.  Once you have established that everything is working you can fabricate a modern replacement battery or AC supply."
electronics,37q1oz,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Fri May 29 14:42:30 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't already have a suitable bench supply, wouldn't that be a bit pricey? I took a look at Tequipment, and the cheapest bench supply they have with 90 V DC output is nearly $500.  ""Phil's old Radios"" has a page on powering antique battery radios. It suggests that ten 9 V  number 216 transistor radio batteries in series can be used, but notes that they won't last long.  An AC supply is probably best, and the above mentioned page gives a simple design, only requiring 3 capacitors, 3 resistors, and one diode (plus connectors). (It also notes that adding an isolation transformer would be a good idea).  Before even thinking about how to get 90 V, I wonder if it would make sense to first get a 1.5 V battery and try that. The 1.5 V battery would be the one powering the heaters on the tubes (the 90 V provides the plate voltage), and the heater circuit would probably be just the battery and the heaters and a switch...no capacitors to go bad. This might reveal if the tubes are OK or not.  That would be good to know, in case some of the tubes are very hard or expensive to replace. Better to find that out sooner rather than later."

(Is the plate voltage really 90V on this unit?)  You can certainly build your own power supply, but I strongly recommend against running anything that isn't isolated.  Particularly if you are going to be poking around with a meter.  Using a bunch of 9V batteries in series is actually quite reasonable for testing.  That is going to provide a fair bit of current limiting for you.  You are not going to be able to test anything with just a 1.5V battery.  If you want to test the tubes, the best thing to do is to find a tube tester.  That is exceptionally difficult these days."

One thing is that batteries are very ""quiet"" and the radio may not have any filtering to keep the noise of a switching power supply out."

electronics,37lry0,FullFrontalNoodly,9,Thu May 28 16:19:45 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Why are you even invoking a digital pot in the first place?
electronics,37lry0,s1gmoid,0,Thu May 28 16:23:21 2015 UTC,"As I mentioned, the filaments being used as the hotwire vary, and the operating temperature of the hotwire affects the sensitivity of the measurement.

I'd like to have the option to set it from Labview essentially.  edit: Oh and also ambient temperature changes. The schematic I linked to you has dealt with that problem by putting in a PTC thermistor in place of the resistor I'm interested in controlling."
electronics,37lry0,FullFrontalNoodly,15,Thu May 28 16:28:07 2015 UTC,"If you want to adjust the temperature under digital control, the proper approach is to use a temperature sensor, PWM control on the heater, and a PID loop.  Alternatively, you can put the reference voltage on the controlling op-amp under digital control.  Although you could use a high-precision DAC, you could also use PWM and a low-pass filter to generate the reference voltage since your update frequency would be essentially zero."
electronics,37lry0,bistromat,6,Thu May 28 16:32:03 2015 UTC,"I second that. Instead of a resistor, you need PWM on the heater. PWM allows you to set the RMS voltage across a load from a microcontroller - exactly what you need here.  Whether you go all the way with a temperature sensor and a PID controller, or just make it so you can set the voltage from a computer manually, it's the right approach.

electronics,37lry0,SuperNutella,7,Thu May 28 17:56:29 2015 UTC,"So, instead of a resistive divider using R2 and R3, you want to use a DAC to generate the reference voltage for the op-amp.   The reason digital pots aren't common is there are almost always better ways to solve your problem.  I also echo the other posters' comments that using PWM to modulate temperature is probably a better solution than this op-amp circuit, especially since you already have a microcontroller in the system to provide the PWM."
electronics,37lry0,I_knew_einstein,11,Thu May 28 19:02:10 2015 UTC,"What the people above are saying is that your problem is changing temperature but you're seeing it as a problem of changing resistance. If you want to change temperature digitally then your current approach of using a potentiometer, and extending it to a digital potentiometer, is probably not correct. Fundamentally the temperature is proportional to current, so you should be looking for a solution that allows you to digitally control current: PWM."
electronics,37lry0,spainguy,1 point,Thu May 28 16:38:16 2015 UTC,"So what are you trying to keep constant? A digital potmeter, while being very linear, would still need constant calibration to adjust for changes in temperature or filament.  The best (and easiest) way would be to have a control loop, where you measure the parameter you want to keep constant (temperature or current or whatever), and use the measurement to change it in the direction you want it.  A digital potmeter would be an option to change the temperature/current to wherever you want it to be, but the same could be done much easier through PWM, or a transistor and a DAC. Linearity is no longer an issue, because you have a control loop."

The current gets set by a voltage on the ""in"" pin and can come from a DAC. With a few resistors you set up an operating point, so your DAC voltage changes the temeprature in you desired working range.

All the designs I've seen use a larger diameter core, maybe 2-3cm, and a top load (metal sphere or tore) to provide some capacitance in series with the secondary inductor.  I'd also replace the LED with a proper high-voltage diode like 1N4007 (or even 2 1N4007's in series); a LED really can't take a lot of reverse voltage and won't really protect your transistor against transients. Finally, 7.5V is on the low end of the voltage it takes to make this work, most of the builds I've seen use 12V or 18V.

(It does not mean that the peak is in blue or green.) This can be done in a few ways, depending on the detector. Absorptive films, optimized windows, or variations on the detector itself.   For the photodiodes you're looking at, responsivity is about a factor of 2x different between red and blue in the blue-enhanced models, which to me (as a detector person) is pretty good for a COTS part.  EDIT: That being said, if you want something centered more around 350-550, here's a Thorlabs part which is not bad, if you feel like putting together your own readout electronics: http://www.thorlabs.com/thorcat/12100/FGAP71-SpecSheet.PDF"

I notice that the blue-enhanced photodiodes have a lower responsivity for blue than the regular Si detectors, even if the peak is indeed shifted to the shorter wavelengths... maybe light absorption from the filter they use? Anyways, because of this, and since I'm going to include a bandpass filter in the design anyways, I'm thinking about using the most sensitive detector in my price range, regardless of where the peak is.

electronics,37d967,Petomni,23,Wed May 27 00:21:51 2015 UTC,"You're right. It only burns my non-conductive skin to get to the conductive tissues. When it gets there, there is no more pain!  And when I hold a metal piece like my screwdriver, my hand doesn't burn anymore because, 1) the current is distributed over a bigger surface 2) my pressure on the metal makes non-conductive skin thinner and more conductive"

electronics,37d967,Petomni,4,Wed May 27 02:06:54 2015 UTC,"There is some debate as to whether the lack of pain is due to the skin effect, or just that our nerves can't detect electric currents above a certain frequency.   I'm pretty sure the burns are due to the heat of the arc (which explains why you only get burned when the tesla coil arcs directly to your hand.  If you plan to keep increasing the power, I would suggest you take a few more safety precautions, such as plugging it in using extension cords so you can be a good distance away when you turn it on. You should also start thinking about proper grounding (It appears you are grounding the secondary via the wall socket), which will also increase Q of the secondary."

electronics,37ee4i,cnlohr,3,Wed May 27 00:43:28 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Number of pins is dictated by physics (each signal its own return path) and reserved pins are not simple N/C.  The number of pins is dictated by physics. A lot of electronics newbies have the misconception, that, for example, one single large gauge GND conductor should suffice. Unfortunately doing to leads to a lot of problems.  If you're looking at the DC characteristics, having a single GND means, that current flowing through that conductor by resistive voltage drop biases the level reference for all signals using that GND conductor as return path. Hence ideally for every signal you have one dedicated GND connection.  This also means that when designing some speedy cable connection (i.e. everything with more than 1MHz) every signal should have its own GND return path. If you look at ribbon cables often every other wire is used for GND, for that very reason.  When you can read that some pins are ""reserved and should be connected to GND"", these pins are actually not RFU (reserved for future use), but usually used by the manufacturer to verify and test the device in production. The circuit implemented for this also doubles as voltage decoupling during normal operation. By connecting it to GND additional AC return paths are provided for on-chip signals, improving the internal performance characteristics."

I really didn't know if it actually belonged here or not, as I'm not a subscriber, but I saw some other posts of people looking for help with electronic stuff and thought I'd give it a go. Judging on the downvotes, I think it doesn't...   A lot more workable, and a lot less barbaric.   Sometimes you just have to be a little rude with these dammed plastic things when they don't do what you want them to do.  Conclusion: Anyway, I actually found out the problem. Turns out the XBOX controller groups its buttons in 5 different ground nets, so by wiring it to the single ground net of the wheel, I was mixing it all up and making it not work. I'm still doing it without damaging the XBOX controller, but gave up on the wheel pcb and I'm manually cutting traces to isolate the ground nets. It's worked so far for a couple buttons with different ground nets, so I guess I'll just do the whole thing.  Thanks for answering though, other people just readly downvoted it without even bothering."

You can find a cheap uP with an ethernet controller and a TCP stack for $5. You can even run an http server on those, so you can toggle the switch from your web browser. I'd suggest going for a mechanical relay as well (cheaper and hardly any energy loss), unless there is a specific reason to use a SSR."

electronics,37f85w,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Wed May 27 10:23:35 2015 UTC,"Most modern high-end PC power supplies instantly switch off if a fault is detected. You can short any of the power rails to gnd and the power supply will need to be unplugged from the mains before it will switch back on.   Also you will note that the adapter board I used is fused on each output. This limits the current just fine in the event that the failsafes fail, and the circuit draws too much power. You list a similar board in the link you posted. This setup is perfectly fine for the average enthusiast / weekend maker as it will power their breadboard project, arduino, or LED project just fine.   The link you posted also claims that the rails on a PSU are very noisy, and while that may be true for much older, lower efficiency, or cheap PSU's, the one I use in the video had less than 0.02v ripple on any of the rails based on testing with my oscilloscope."

It's from a lawn mower with a 36v lead acid battery. It's not current limited, just a 100A fuse, which also protects the smaller drive motor.  I'm having trouble with that one too. It's a Mabuchi RS-775WC-4540. The closest data sheet Mabuchi has is here. You'll see that there is a RS-775VC-4540 which has a 36v max voltage (keep in mind that the battery is actually 40v+ fully charged), and there's a RS-775WC-8017 which is 20v max. I've scoured their website and emailed but never got a response.  This page gave me the following info for my RS-775WC-4540:  R=Round type, S=Carbon Brushes, 7=Armature Diameter, next 7=Housing Length, 5=5 Poles, W=Anisotropic or Rare Earth Magnet (same with V, not sure what the difference is), C=Some unknown motor spec, 45=0.45mm diameter magnet wire,  and 40=Number of turns of armature wire per slot.   There is no voltage-reducing circuitry to either motor, at least not at maximum speed. The drive motor might have current limiting, but I haven't been able to reverse engineer the board yet. I have pics if anybody's interested. I haven't been able to find a motor driver that will let me reverse the motor direction and PWM the speed for less than about $200, and I'll need two because I stole the motor and transmission from a second mower to make it a skid-steer drive. I'm planning on building a driver from scratch unless anybody can recommend something that will get me closer to $100 total for the drive motors.  As for the big motor, PWM isn't critical, but I may want the option and since I have an extra one of those, I would like to use it for another big robot or attachment for the mower or something."

It uses an EM78P259N 8-bit microcontroller. There is also an ME75N75T N-Channel MOSFET and an LM358 dual op amp. Speed is controlled with a 20k pot, but I think there are only 3 steps; that's what it felt like when I was actually mowing with it.  The Oatley Electronics board looks like it has potential. I would have to replace the direction switch with a relay which shouldn't be a big deal, but since the speed is controlled with a pot, what's the best way to do that remotely? My understanding is that digital pots typically have super low current ratings so I would have to get around that somehow, no? I could use a servo to turn it, but this thing is going to be dangerous enough as it is and that would add more potential for failure. I'm using a hobby RC transmitter and an Arduino Mega.  edit: fixed links"

What you really need is a brushed ESC. There are some controllers here. http://kellycontroller.com/kds48050e50a24v-48v-mini-brushed-controller-p-282.html  You are stuck half way between EV and RC territory, trying to control EV stuff, with RC technology.   All EV controllers use a 0-5 volt throttle, where as most high power RC stuff is 3 pole brushless using servo pulse control.  http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__32025__HobbyKing_X_Car_45A_Brushed_Car_ESC.html is the closest high power servo pulse controller, but wont do your voltage range.  You are either going to have to roll your own high voltage PWM, or find an easy way to convert servo pulse into a 0-5 volt control.

Connect an atttiny or similar to those pins and write a simple program that counts down a couple of seconds before toggling one of its output pins on after it is powered on.   connect the control side of a small solid state relay to that pin.  Clip one of the wires that goes to the speaker and put the relay in the middle of it.  Boom, no more power on sound.   If you can't find relays that are small enough, to fit in the case, you probably can substitute them with a couple of transistors,  but it would make things more a lot more complicated if you aren't familiar with how they work.

In some cases (e.g. first order, single bit SD-DAC) the output is essentially Pulse Width Modulated.  Again the thing that identifies the system is the Sigma Delta loop filter. Sigma Delta Modulators are not limited to single bit outputs.  Nor are they limited to being a DAC, you can use Sigma Delta modulators to create an ADC as well.  A multi-bit Sigma Delta output (or input for an ADC) stage will look quit a bit different from a PWM output and are common.  Most high performance DACs (pretty much everything with >16bit performance) are 3-5 Order, 4-8 bit output Sigma Delta Modulators.  It is also useful to know that while the higher order loop filters retain the name 'Sigma-Delta' they are more correctly called Noise Shaping filters.

I suppose it already uses some sort of delta modulation, anyway it is an advanced project by an experienced engineer and I'd like to reimplement synthesis independently (as an exercise, really... most of the stuff hobbyists do has already been done better, usually). I wanted to bypass the conversion step (as it is probably expensive for the relatively weak AVR microcontroller) and feed the outputs a 1-bit stream directly, of course this puts any processing out of the question."
electronics,373p5w,safiire,1 point,Sun May 24 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"I was looking at this the other day because I have basically the same question as you, and I think he is bit-banging the 39215hz 8-bit sample rate into an actual DAC IC, and that is how it becomes 1Mhz 1-bit.  At least that is what I got from looking at it, if I'm not right I would love to know what it is doing.  I was a little confused if the DAC was for CV or the audio output, or he does both with a DAC.  Edit:  I am actually investigating doing dual PWM so I can lower my noisefloor, I found this earlier that was helpful http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/pwm-dac/    The other option, which I don't really want to do, is to use that wolfson based audio codec shield on the atmega.  I don't want to do that cause I have that wolfson chip on an entirely other synth I made on something else, and just want to use atmega pwm and a filter on this one."
electronics,373p5w,safiire,1 point,Mon May 25 02:16:18 2015 UTC,"He apparently uses the PWM outputs, he said. He doesn't use an Arduino, his board only shares the choice of microcontroller with it but he coded everything in pure C++ + bits of assembly without taking advantage of the Arduino framework for better efficiency. In addition to that, he overclocked the uC @ 20MHz, I suppose to achieve that 10MHz 1-bit output. I don't know how he converts the 39215Hz 8-bit stream into a 10MHz 1-bit output (I suppose he takes two consecutive values, evaluates if x(n+1) >= x(n), and outputs a string of 255** 1s or 0s according to the result). I don't know how he actually manages to do it, honestly (a 20MHz clock means he has to dedicate one clock cycle out of two to the output), but as I said, I have no experience at all so it is probably out of my depth for the moment.  ** : 10MHz / 39215Hz = approx. 255"
electronics,373p5w,safiire,1 point,Mon May 25 09:30:05 2015 UTC,"I looked it up on Mutable Instruments' forum:  http://mutable-instruments.net/forum/discussion/2157/signal-path-and-carrier-frequency/p1  ""The oscillators signals are rendered at a sample rate of 39215.7 Hz (10M / 255), with a resolution of 8 bits. Each “sample” is converted into a sequence of 255 bits by the ATMega hardware (there is no code doing that!) usingPWM modulation. So if you look at the signal you will see that:   The smallest unit of time over which the signal is constant is (1 / 10 MHz) and it can only take 2 values, 0 or 1 (Hence the 1-bit, 10 MHz). The equivalent sample-rate / resolution in terms of internal computations is 39215.7 Hz / 8-bit. Because of the way PWM works, the resulting signal has a strong frequency peak at 39215.7 Hz, and all its odd harmonics. For example, to output a null, centered signal, the only possible way to do it with PWM is to go back and forth between 0V and 5V at the carrier frequency. So when the Shruthi-1 is not playing any sound, you still see a 39kHz square wave on the oscillators output. Ouch!   As for the control signals, the modulation PWM modulation frequency is the same (10 MHz, 1-bit, 8-bit internal resolution so a peak at 39215.7 Hz), but the signals are recomputed only every 40th audio sample.""  So he's chosen basically the highest sample rate he could choose and, apparently, the ATMega hardware natively implements PWM output as simple delta modulation (because 255x oversampling with no noise shaping provides 8-bit resolution). I don't get that carrier frequency though: if the ATMega is switching states (1 bit resolution) at 10MHz, why is the carrier 39.2kHz?"
electronics,373p5w,safiire,2,Mon May 25 11:54:30 2015 UTC,"I wrote up a huge explanation for this last night under the assumption that there is a 12 bit DAC because the code he's using is his Avril AVR C++ template library, the audio_out.EmitSample(); line in his Timer2 Overflow Interrupt is derived from a class that says it can do PwmOutput and 12-bit DAC, but I think what it really means is it can do Audio Output using PwmOutput OR 12-bit DAC.  I searched the schematic, and even searched my actual Shruthi looking for this DAC and didn't find it.  the PWM output pin off his ATMega goes directly to the Analog board for processing, and I didn't see a DAC, so I erased my post, but also erased a bunch of information about how to actually do PWM on the ATMega, because I still could not explain how he gets 10 Mhz 1-bit out of it.  So he's using Timer2, which is an 8-bit timer, in Phase Correct mode, you can see him set that in shruthi/shruthi.cc I believe.  That counter can either count from 0 to 255 and then it overflows and wraps around, or in Phase Correct mode, it will count from 0 to 255 and then back to 0, 510 discrete steps because it uses the 0 and 255 both on the way up and down (29) - 2.  Since that chip is rated to go max 20Mhz, and he has a 20Mhz crystal on it, 20Mhz / 510 = 39,215.7, which in the comments he shorthands as 40kHz.  Phase correct mode basically makes the carrier twice as slow in frequency.  Since he is using the Timer2 in PWM, Phase Corrected mode, it automatically generates a PWM carrier wave of 39,215.7hz on pin OC2, which you can see goes directly to the analog board.    In order to change the 8-bit digital sample value every Ts = 1/39,215.7 seconds during the interrupt, he just has to change the value in the output compare register, probably named OCR2A.  The output compare register is what controls the % of duty cycle.  It is as if Ts seconds is divided into 510 divisions, when the counter passes OCR2A on the way up, it turns the pin high, and when it passes OCR2A on the way down it turns the pin off, controlling the duty cycle.  Lookup the visualization of Phase Corrected PWM mode, the counter going from 0 to 255, and then back to 0 makes a triangle wave shape, when you overlay the PWM carrier on it, you see that changing OCR2A changes the width of the pulse, and it is either centred on 0 or centred on 255 (depending on how you have your COM bits set on the timer).    First I was like ok, let's divide 39,215.7 by 510 ""bits"", that doesn't give us 10MHz.  Then I realize that even though the counter counts up and down, there is still only 28 possible values you can have for OCR2A which controls the duty cycle.    If it's 39,215.7 Hz 8-bit Then it must be  39,215.7 * 256.0 = 10,039,219.2 Hz 1-bit  I know that we are not talking about Arduinos, my project is on an plain ATMega328 chip with no Arduino anything, and Ollivier's Shruthi is on ATMega466p, these two chips have basically the same data sheet they are so similar, they have the same 3 Timers as far as I know.  The reason I linked you to OpenMusicLabs PWM page, is because, Arduino or not, this page explains how to do PWM on your chip, and even how to do Dual PWM, and the theory behind it, in a way more comprehensive way than I can type in a Reddit post.  Hope that helps: http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/pwm-dac/ http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/pwm-dac/dual-pwm-circuits/ http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/pwm-dac/pwm-distortion-analysis/  OpenMusicLabs also makes a shield for Arduino or the LeafLabs Maple 32-bit ARM board that has an audio codec on it that I've used in a past polysynth, that's the only reason I brought up Arduino.  Edit:  Even if I am some part of this wrong, reading that page will help you understand how he's doing audio output.  I do have my ATMega making audio with this scheme in phase correct mode at the moment, it does work, but it comes with all the issues of a digital method, like aliasing, nyquist theorem, etc.  It shows on OML page what happens if you don't use Phase Corrected mode, any sinusoid is sort of shifted/squished towards one direction, so I think it is best to use Phase Correct mode even though it makes the carrier twice as slow.  Edit: I put 32,215 / 256, and I meant 39,215 * 256, fixed."

electronics,373p5w,AndElectrons,1 point,Mon May 25 18:29:07 2015 UTC,"No problem, I am trying to help, I just don't want to transfer my misconceptions over to you.  I seriously thought a DAC was involved yesterday by looking at the code in the Avril library.    The easiest way to test this out is just encode some 8-bit unsigned PCM data into your program, and set the output compare register to this value in an interrupt.  On my breadboard I also have the pwm audio output pin going to a voltage divider to get it down to about 0.47 V to get consumer line level, and then I have a 1/4"" audio jack going into my soundcard.  It needs a filter too, but my soundcard is providing that at the moment."
electronics,373r37,Chewie316,3,Sun May 24 16:30:53 2015 UTC,"The phono stage will not be affected by this; using the WeMo would be just like using the switch at the back of the phonostage's power supply.  And, judging from the photo of the power supply, there is nothing special about that circuitry that would be significantly affected by using the WeMo unless you were literally switching it on and off hundreds of times per day.  The only concern that I have is that the Wi-Fi signals from the WeMo might get picked up the the turntable cartridge or cables, causing a chirping or buzzing noise.  This would be remedied by either moving the WeMo away from the audio equipment or simply not using the WeMo."
electronics,373r37,RobinUrthos,1 point,Sun May 24 18:29:17 2015 UTC,"The teardown shows that the WeMo triggers the load circuit with a relay... so I would suspect that an electrically-isolated circuit won't have much for RF coupling on the lines.  If the phono stage really was sensitive to Wifi signals, I'd think that it would show up whether a WeMo was used or not."
electronics,373r37,emcniece,2,Sun May 24 22:51:22 2015 UTC,"I'm more concerned about the cartridge picking up the signals, not the preamp.  Although cartridges are pretty well shielded, they still tend to be pretty sensitive to wifi signals, which can become strange noises due to the audio equipment's nonlinearity at GHz frequencies.  For example, if I have my laptop next to my turntable, I can hear chirping coming out of the speakers.  What I'm saying is that it's possible to cause issues if it's placed right next to the turntable, but easily solved with sane cable and unit placement."

Once we were ready to mass produce, we submitted to Polycase SVG image files for the faces and an STL file with all of the holes that we wanted machined in the case.  They have a fairly reasonable setup cost for that and it turned out to be pretty economical for our ~150 unit initial batch size."

Works very well and it's rather efficient and silent (albeit takes dust easily).  The internal construction is OK.  If you cut the output connector, you basically have many 12V and GND wires, one (if I remember correctly) 5V, the power enable wire and a remote sense wire that needs to be connected to the 12V wires.  Try to keep the cable, it's good quality. I've replaced mine with a heavy, low AWG cable but I guess that the original is OK as well.  Please be aware that the PSU is prone to power off (+ lights a red indicator) in case of unexpected high loads, such as when you connect a device that draws a lot of power at power-up."
electronics,370hog,Balaur,3,Sat May 23 21:36:53 2015 UTC,"Hmm, I've only experienced that error condition when loads are suddenly disconnected, not when connected. On a scope you can actually see the output voltage going slightly up (a pretty small, short transient, I wouldn't worry too much about it) and then dropping to as low as 4V (depends on load) for tens of milliseconds. As long as another significant load is still connected, it doesn't usually power off.  It's almost like a PID controller with a very high I gain.  That being said, it only seems to be an issue for fast hard switching of high power loads, e.g. a 10A resisitive load being switch off by a MOSFET. Using PWM in the KHz range to slowly switch off the load works ok. It's also fine with a wide dynamic power range for SBCs or eGPUs."

The low ESR types will then list the ESR at a specific test frequency (usually 100kHz), so you could compare between caps.  Something like this will probably fit the bill, but check physical size.   Digikey has an impedance column in the filters - just put like 50milliohms or less, at that size of capacitance.  edit: 40V is a fairly non standard rating, you'll have better luck finding 50V caps.

electronics,36yjcv,noiserr,1 point,Sat May 23 09:35:36 2015 UTC,"low ESR caps discharge and charge faster than regular caps. This is why they are used in filtering applications, to remove noise. A high ESR cap cannot charge fast enough to absorb  the spikes, and it can't discharge fast enough to absorb the dips.  However ESR works just like with resistors, when wired in parallel the resistance is split. You can use multiple higher ESR caps to create a low ESR capacitor. So you can get like 3x 1000uF caps with those specs and you will likely be fine. Just hook them up in parallel."

So what's probably happening with your charger is either some wires are in contact when they shouldn't, or there is a break within one of the wires from excessive bending. (I think the latter is more likely)"
electronics,36ya2e,dzjc,1 point,Sat May 23 03:27:53 2015 UTC,hmm i think the bending might be more plausible. i can't afford 70$ to get a new one tho.

electronics,36ya2e,rottle,1 point,Sat May 23 03:35:24 2015 UTC,This is a bad idea. You can get a roll of electrical tape and just add insulation around the wires that got exposed for an interim fix.
electronics,36ya2e,dokid,1 point,Sat May 23 03:47:54 2015 UTC,so are you saying just insulating the exposed wires will solve the problem temporarily? i just need to hang on for about 2 months until i save enough money to get a new one.

electronics,36ya2e,piranha,1 point,Sat May 23 05:01:28 2015 UTC,looks to me like the wire is broken? if yes then you need to strip it and solder it together or if you don't have an iron twist it together. then put electrical tape over the exposed wire. essentially you need to make sure that there is no break in the wires and that each wire is not making contact with the other wires.
electronics,36ya2e,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Sat May 23 05:10:28 2015 UTC,yea so i can cut the broken part and then i can strip the wires again to connect them to the core of the charger. that was my plan.

In early 1997, LTC’s DAC design group tasked the author to measure 16-bit DAC settling time. The result was published in July 1998 as Application Note 74, “Component and Measurement Advances Ensure 16-Bit DAC Settling Time”. Almost exactly 10 years later, the DAC group raised the ante, requesting 18-bit DAC settling time measurement. This constitutes 2 bits of resolution improvement per decade of author age. Since it was unclear how many decades the author (born 1948) had left, it was decided to double jump the performance requirement and attempt 20-bit resolution. In this way, even if the author is unavailable in 10 years, the DAC group will still get its remaining 2 bits.   http://cds.linear.com/docs/en/application-note/an120f.pdf"

electronics,36xhtl,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Sat May 23 04:29:12 2015 UTC,"USB charging can draw quite a lot of current, more than the 500 mA that is specified by USB 2 (is USB3 more?). 500 mA at 5 V is 2.5 W so I don't think that you will have a great time charging USB. A 7805 has a dropout Voltage that will not let you use it in this application, you may need to use a switching DC-DC adapter.  I would pick up a bigger solar panel or pick up a USB solar charger as they have all of this dealt with in on product and they are pretty cheap - maybe 10-20 USD.  What you are proposing is possible however you will want a larger output from the panel and maybe look at a different method of getting an output of 5 V. Look on eBay for DC-DC converter with a price filter of 0-8 USD/0-3 quid. Look for a product that outputs 0-30 V - very useful in this application."

electronics,36xhtl,tenfolddamage,1 point,Fri May 22 23:16:00 2015 UTC,Panel ratings are usually load ratings.  A ~6V panel may actually put out >9V under minimal/no load
electronics,36xhtl,EkriirkE,1 point,Sat May 23 20:18:51 2015 UTC,it would certainly be simpler but it's a poor solution. The panel will only output the peak Voltage in maximum sunlight exposure so I guess a lot of real world use of your solution would be outputting below the low Voltage range of the USB standard. A DC-DC converter would take a large range of input Voltages and output a regulated 5 VDC. You will lose some efficiency but then you lose some with the diode current as well.

You will get uneven light, as the current might not run evenly through them. The current will split up in to each chain, and with 150mA input they would only get 25mA each.   Then you might think that sending in 900mA is a good idea, but if one LED in a chain dies, the current will flow to the rest giving them 180mA."

I am going to assume you setup the schematic correctly based on the datasheet.   Without looking at the specifics, it is a buck converter, it will take your 11-24V input and step it down to a CC output at a voltage level below the input, the input current will depend on the output voltage level (taking into account the efficiency of the converter).   The voltage for the LED strings is going to be whatever the highest series forward voltage is for the strings of LED's. This means you may have some small overhead for strings that have a lower forward voltage -- you can expect higher junction temperatures on the strings with lower forward voltages.   VTH Set Current Threshold Voltage 95 100 105 mV. The Vth you are asking about is going to be roughly 100mV.   Is there any current regulation on your input 11-24VDC?"
electronics,36vnj0,Aggressiveneutral,1 point,Fri May 22 18:08:39 2015 UTC,"I think there is an error in your AL8805 LED driver schematic. You have SW connected to the input supply, and GND isn't connected to the input supply GND.  Considering your skill level, I think you should forget about the LED driver and just use the resistors to limit current.  you can work out the exact voltage needed to power the strip by using ohms law  V=IR  The 3 LEDS can be though of as a single LED that has a foward drop of all the individual ones combined 3.2+ 3.2 + 3.2 = 9.6V, that requires 150mA  if our input voltage is X then we know X-9.6 is the voltage that will be dropped across your current limit resistor. which needs to be 150mA or slightly less.   X-9.6/12.5 = 150mA  Rearrange for X X= 0.150 * 12.5 + 9.6 X = 11.475V  So you want a power supply that is less than 11.475V.   To calculate current, we know we have 6 columns of LEDS and each column is going to need 150mA. so 6* 150 = 900mA. To be on the safe side you will want a power supply than can deliver 1000mA to 1500mA at least.  It is very unlikely you will find a power supply that puts out 11.475 volts. What it looks like is that the strip is designed for a 12V supply that has a protection diode in series (0.7V drop) which will make the voltage the strip sees 11.3V.   at 11.3V the current will be 130mA for each column of LEDs which is plenty.  So what you want is a 12V supply which should be fairly easy to find and to drop that supply down to around 11.3V."

electronics,36tsfu,curtquarquesso,3,Fri May 22 01:39:48 2015 UTC,"First off, you are going to get a much better critique on your overall design from one of the dedicated HAB forums.  Secondly, while you can ballpark current consumption from specifications, that is as close as you are going to get.  You are going to need to build and measure to get actual data.  Unless you absolutely need a Raspberry Pi I strongly suggest a microcontroller-based solution as that will only consume a fraction of the current."

You also have the general issue of physical reliability.  The Pi uses some very fine pitch parts on a multi-layer board, while a microcontroller is going to have larger and more robust connections.  The big difference is that with a microcontroller it is much easier to run a watchdog that will restart the system much more quickly if something does cause it to lock up."

electronics,36tsfu,Reflowster,1 point,Fri May 22 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"From mudclub's response.. seems like 1.5W to 2W is a good estimate for a GoPro and about the same for a raspi.  mAh stands for milliamp hour which is the amount of energy you need in a battery to provide one milliamp for one hour.  A watt is a Joule per second (energy / time)  You can relate watts and amps (current) using Amps = Watts/Volts  For 3 GoPros and a raspi.. (assuming 1.5-2W for each) we expect a power consumption of 6-8 Watts (between 4 * 1.5 and 4 * 2 watts)  I believe both the GoPros and the raspi operate at 5V (double check this though, it's probably important)  So we expect a current between 1.2 (6/5) and 1.6 (8/5) amps or 1200 to 1600 mA  So you'll probably need a minimum of between 4200 (12003.5) and 5600 (16003.5) mAh for 3.5 hours of operation.  Generally better to overestimate these things, so I'd aim for a solid 6000 mAh.  Someone check my math, it wasn't really my strong suit tbh"

electronics,36svkm,akimtke,3,Thu May 21 21:15:34 2015 UTC,"I think the whole ""don't be afraid to fail"" motto needs to go. It carries an inherent side effect of causing apathy which is problematic. Generalizing all failures as inconsequential means that no one should get fired and all those failures should be overlooked.  Instead, I follow the personal ""be curious"" motto. Something broke? Don't throw it away, be curious about why it broke. Maybe you can fix it. Maybe you don't have the tools yet. Regardless of the outcome, you still learn something new as a result of curiosity. Yes, you are going to fail but keeping the fear of failure heightens the bliss of success."
electronics,36svkm,1wiseguy,2,Fri May 22 01:11:46 2015 UTC,"""Don’t be afraid to fail.""  I never liked that phrase. It makes it sounds like failing isn't a bad thing.  I don't want to fail, so I try to make things work. The first time, if possible. That's a really important thing these days, when budgets are tight and schedules are short.  It's not about fear; it's about excellence.   When Intel is designing a new chip, does the project lead tell his guys ""don't be afraid to fail""? No; heads are going to roll if that chip doesn't work.  On the other hand, tearing stuff down to see how it works is a great thing. I don't think I ever tossed a VCR or computer or Keurig machine in the bin before pulling out the guts. There is no success or failure associated with tearing stuff down. It's just a learning experience."
electronics,36svkm,rainwulf,2,Thu May 21 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"I had an instructor at college that said this to me:  ""If there is something wrong, dont be afraid to milk the controls. Get what you can from what you can see, push, prod, get in there and follow it through. It's already broken, so go and see what's broken and work out why it's broken, then you can work out how to fix it. All devices are just a series of black boxes, inputs and outputs. All black boxes contain smaller black boxes. Break them down until you find the one that's causing the problem."""

There's no reasonable way to keep a lot of stuff with no place to go tidy with it all out on the work surface.

Then if I wasn't working on one for a long time or a permanent soldered version was working, I could tear down the breadboard version.  Similar for things on the desk: if I haven't used it in a few days, put it away. With storage places for everything, only things relevant to current projects can be kept out. This includes tools (why I don't have the multimeter or o-scope on the desk in the photo). Naturally something with a higher cost of pulling out will be left on the desk for longer unused before I put it away. Dust has also been an issue so having unused things stored away gives me peace-of-mind.

When i moved in with my wife i did not dear to start up a lab anymore fearing that she would smack me around if there would be one corner in the house looking like that.  But the electronic tickle kept bugging me. So i agreed (more with myself) to keep my lab tidy. It is a habit thing more than anything else. How many times have you looked for these tweesers or that screwdriver that you had in you hand 10 seconds ago and is nowhere to be found? How annoying is it to find a bunch of smd caps that you know where designated for a project, yet you failed to keep them separate and now you have to guess or measure their capacitance since it is not denoted on them? Did you ever step / sat in/onto a partly scavenged circuitboard?  I came into the habit to keep everything in its designated space. It only starts to show of after a weeks but this habit works. Done with the solder pump? Put it in the right place! All the time! If it is not in your hand, it has to be in its place. Of course the first 5 (or 50) times you wont remember. So you will start looking for it. This pain will be a reminder to put it the fuck back where it belongs. Keep forgetting? Keep searching for it (i get irrationally upset by myself hiding stuff from myself) and again - pain - conditioning - Auto-Pavlov. In the long run you will save time since you always know where all your stuff is. The nature of our craft is that we deal with so many tools and components that it is very difficult to have a right place for all items, but you can build it up slowly. I am at work otherwise i would show some picks of my workplace. The electronic lab is one side of the room, and the otherside is my music/synth studio. A tiny room, i would not be able to make something at all were it not for this acquired habit.  tl;dr, item / tool not in your hand, put it back! Make this a habit."

Being on your feet you are more likely to put something away than to set it down.  Rule 2- Compact keyboard.  Get rid of the num pad for the extra space and it saves time by reducing distance from typing position to mouse position.  Rule 3- Vertical monitors save space.  We deal mostly in documents and source code where vertical monitors are better anyway.  Rule 4- Stylish mousepad, mine is from an Eric Joyner print.  Rule 5- Put your soldering stuff away.  Unless you are a tech, most of the time on a project is the firmware so you don't need to have all your prototyping stuff out most of the time.  Rule 6- The rolling shelf is great for medium-large prototypes, you just cart it away if someone else wants to work on it.  Heres mine http://i.imgur.com/hayKe5wl.jpg"

electronics,36s79z,EliIceMan,3,Thu May 21 18:22:12 2015 UTC,"I'd say 50mA per LED - max current is calculated from Rθj-amb, max die temperature, and an assumption about ambient temperature.  It doesn't matter much if one LED dissipates 500mW, or if all three share 500mW, since that heat has to come out of the thermal pad on the bottom of the package and be dissipated into the air by the large copper pour on your PCB.  It's entirely possible that since they're all on the same die, you can safely parallel them without any resistors at all.  Having said that, if you put a small resistor in series with each one, they'll definitely share current and you only need one channel of your CC driver.  Since you're driving CC and all the LEDs share a die, you can use a resistor as small as 1Ω with good results. The CC driver will automatically provide the extra 60mV required.  1Ω resistors would only dissipate 3.6mW, so 0603 or 0402 SMD parts would be perfectly adequate if you have size constraints, and you don't take much of a hit to your efficiency."

electronics,36s79z,Aggressiveneutral,1 point,Fri May 22 01:51:14 2015 UTC,How the current is distributed depends on the forward voltage of each of the dies. The way to balance a load like this is to measure what the forward voltage is when the LED's are powered on for a significant amount of time (taking into account the drooping due to heat) and to pick a resistor value for each cathode connection to normalize the voltage on each string.
electronics,36s79z,1wiseguy,1 point,Fri May 22 18:23:34 2015 UTC,"People always declare that you can't parallel diodes, but you can. How well they share current is a good question. You might want to look into that before you make a production product, but I bet they will share current pretty well.   If you imagine the LED factory, they probably have a tray of LED chips that all came from the same wafer, so they are going to be pretty close to identical."

Also, does leaving a battery connected to the charger, assuming it's a dumb charger that outputs a constant voltage, actually damage the battery?

You need a competent engineering partner who knows his shit and who has a stake in your success.

electronics,36sbp3,antiquarian_bookworm,4,Thu May 21 19:18:16 2015 UTC,"Retired engineer here...  Several ways to go with this.  1 Flat rate contract You show the design criteria and the contractor replies with the cost and completion date for a finished and proven prototype. This is an easy-in-easy-out type of thing. Normally there is an exchange of references by both parties to show why they are reliable, and then a small fee is paid to the contractor to get the project started.  2 Fee and Profit Split You show criteria, and contractor takes project at reduced upfront price, with a promise of a percent of sales profit. This can provide the contractor with a trickle of income over years that sometimes is much higher than what the upfront payment might have been, but also might be nothing, if the sales suck.  3 Partnership The ""contractor"" recieves no payment, but papers are drawn up to split all profits of the product. The split lines may or may not be not be 50/50. A lot of contract engineers don't want to do this because of the long term entanglements; they want their freedom.  Whatever you do, you want to get things down on paper and be sure about the person you are dealing with, to make sure they are honest."

electronics,36sbp3,asuspower,4,Sat May 23 12:16:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, I didn't mention hourly payment as method because of two reasons. Number one, the government starts to view that as employment, and you can end up in a legal mess. Number two, most of the hourly contracts I have seen done end up in squabbling between the two parties. For long term projects that can't be estimated in one big flat contract, it is better to hack the long job into a series of flat contracts.  I've done dozens of contracts, and there are lessons to be learned by both parties involved.  Some lessons for the contractor...  1 Make sure the customer knows what they want. If you don't see a well defined criteria of design, then the project will spin in circles and end up very bad for both parties.   2 Get references of the person who is offering you this contract. Who have they done business with before, and was it successfully completed, and can I call them? The contractor needs to interview the customer and determine if the project is worth the risk. You don't just take any contract offered.  3 See the light at the end of the tunnel, estimate those hours and then do the math. Sometimes it is tempting to take a contract without knowing how you are going to complete it, and that normally runs into project deadline over-run and loss of profit because you underestimated the job, or worse, you couldn't complete the job.  Some lessons for the contractor's customer...  1 Realize the engineers like to eat food and live indoors. They need to make a living wage.   2 Ask the engineer to provide references of successful designs that were accomplished to the satisfaction of both parties.  3 Shop around, but remember the lowest bid may not be the best answer. Sometimes a good engineer is between projects, and just waiting for the phone to ring. An engineer in the middle of a project may give you a really high estimate.  4 Short deadline cost double. If I have to work 12 hour days or more, there's a charge for that. If you give me a longer time, I can interweave other contracts into the time schedule and your cost goes down.  And advice to both parties... if you sense any bit of dishonesty in the other party, don't do the contract."

Many shops also have minimums, typically >$10k to make it worth the time. If someone messages you and claims they can do this, you will likely waste your $1000.

The Lm3875 and LM3886 IC's are great chips for making decent powered amps. IIRC they push about ~40 watts at +-28 V. You can either buy the amp boards off ebay for a few bucks or build them yourselves. I've seen some schemes for them that are just the IC and 3 resistors and people seem favorable in them. You could probably just buy a switch mode PSU and a boost converter of ebay for another 10-15 dollars and be able to fit it all nicely in the back of the speaker enclosure. I think they run all the way down to maybe 12 or 15 volts with the trade off being worse THD. However I think it's still around .01% THD at the worst, which is still a pretty solid figure for THD."

Loads of I/O, loads of (and faster!) comms (SPI, I2C, UART etc). Mbed is really not  much more difficult than arduino in my opinion unless you are a complete noob. Less support but it is still there. One caveat is the online-only compiler/IDE, which while nicer than arduino IDE, cannot be accessed without an internet connection.   If you can get the board up and running in an offline IDE (coocox, emblocks, Keil etc) you can use the ST-LINK interface for debugging else you can use arduino-style serial messages over the virtual COM port.  Compared to other mbed boards they don't have on-board ethernet or USB (I think on the USB anyway).   At $10 they are a steal!   Edit: they also have FPUs (the fxxx ones anyway)"

I made a little board that a nucleo plugs into some time ago. Adds 12V->5V 3A buck supply, ENC28J60 ethernet, MCP2515? CAN bus controller, SD card, some I2C sensors, LEDs, etc. I had a little uIP based http server on it, that also pulled time over ntp, and had a telnet server... mostly just played around with it, as I didn't have a specific use in mind. (This was with the F401 nucleo, but I think it should work with all of them, more or less).  I use the STM32F1's in things all the time, F103 is my default controller as (from china, anyway) nothing with even half the features can touch them on price. Going back to my old designs with AVRs feels so bloody clunky now, so many less peripherals, RAM, etc."

For the chips I picked (f0), though, there were a lot of unimplemented or incomplete features and I ended up just moving to using stdperiph.  I wouldn't have been able to do it without libopencm3 to get a base under me.  It was much easier to get the basics going with their setup, and the Makefiles I use with stdperiph are ones I modified from the opencm3 examples.  Stdperiph is weird and verbose and super inconsistent between chip families, but at least all the features are implemented."
electronics,36nl4x,FullFrontalNoodly,3,Thu May 21 13:38:11 2015 UTC,Yes. Mind that learning curve is a bit steeper than arduino. There is also arduino due based around atmel implementation of cortex m3 architecture. Apparently supports all arduino libraries. Never tried it though.

Definately a good cheap way to explore the mbed project.
electronics,36nl4x,dave93cab,2,Wed May 20 19:09:49 2015 UTC,"We work with STM32F1 series and I think they are awesome. Tons of peripheral options and supporting libraries from ST Microelectronics. They require a lot of setup to start up, but once you do, you have a powerful little chip on your hands. You can't beat the price on the nucleo boards, they are definitely not making any money off them.  All in all, it depends on the project if its worth using or not. If you like getting dirty with hardware and electronics then its worth the learning curve. If you want fast development time, I suggest sticking with arduino, or switching to a raspberry pi.  I do recommend the evaluation version of Keil uVision if you are working on it, it has a 32K code limit, support for st-link and debugging utilities, making it easy to develop on the chip. I can't afford the license for bigger projects, so I use the nucleo board with Eclipse, arm gcc and a bunch of plugins."

I used the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjvqySyNw20  The video is a bit old now, but still a useful guide. I didn't need to download the zadig stuff, otherwise I followed most of it. The GDB openocd works with st-link now, so you don't need the macros to debug or load the application, but you still need to add the scripts to properly communicate with the board. I also downloaded a cool plugin for stm32 processors that lets you inspect registers by name and alter bit fields, totally awesome. I wrote down a series of steps I needed to do if you want it."

Only simple LCDs using segments instead of pixels (like a watch) have direct connections to the outside.  Of course you could use VGA or HDMI, but that complicates things. You've then got to deal with high speed data coming in, and you'd still need to hook up all the LEDs.   You could simplify the LED side by buying LEDs with integrated controllers which are already hooked up together and controlled via a single wire. A bunch of LEDs can just need power, ground and a control connection. Look at WS2811 for example."

electronics,36ngcs,1wiseguy,2,Wed May 20 17:50:22 2015 UTC,"You can do good boards with milling, it just costs an absolutely amazing amount of money, if you're a hobbyist, and not doing it for a living.   You can do vias with metal studs that go through a hole to the other side, but you have to manually do them, so it'll take a while if you have a massive board.   I also know there's a chemical bath solution that doesn't involve turning your house into something like a meth lab.   You can do solder resist with a paint that hardens when exposed to UV, and is baked for a while, I imagine it should be possible to paint a silk screen on top of that with a mask and paint.   Fine lines, modern prototype mills can do incredibly fine stuff.   ... Yeah, I spent way too much time reading a brochure at an event. The output from the company's prototype milling machine was seriously impressive though. And it was seriously expensive.   If you haven't got the money, yeah, send the GERBER to any board house anywhere."
electronics,36ngcs,nikomo,1 point,Wed May 20 18:48:06 2015 UTC,"I think maybe those milling machine setups work well for doing some kind of exotic prototypes, maybe RF or high-voltage or power supplies. The need to spin new boards on a moment's notice would probably be involved.  Although you can make crude vias using eyelets or whatever, that isn't practical for typical boards, where vias are packed in close to other stuff, and there's lots of them. I just looked at a board I did recently, and it has 296 vias.  It's standard these days to use ICs with 0.5 mm pitch, and I don't see that working with a machined board. I could be wrong.  It's not like you can't make a working board with that technology, but it kind of takes you back to 1960."

electronics,36ngcs,chrwei,8,Wed May 20 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"By far the easiest way to DIY in my opinion is photoetching.  Here's my process: Design a SMD only board in eagle, with a strong preference to single-layer boards (a ground fill and 0-ohm resistors are your friends)  Output the top layer to a high resolution inkjet (not laser!) printer (I use an Epson Artisan 50, they're super cheap) onto silkscreen transparency film (this has a treated surface that accepts inkjet ink).  Using photo-etch boards (MG Chemicals are good), expose the board with the printed film as a contact print. Develop (it uses dilute sodium hydroxide developer) and then etch (I use ammonium perchlorate, which is way cleaner and easier to handle disposal off than ferric chloride. Others are big on acid+hydrogen peroxide, you choose.)  After this you can use the board, plate it, or put on a solder mask -- all optional.  I can do 8 mil lines all day long, and can do 4 mil if I baby the process. Once you get the routine down, you can go from design to board in well under an hour."

But I think acid etching is way easier. What me and a friend did is build a cheap insulator, which is just a PCB full of UV LEDS in a box. It's pretty cheap. Then you can just print your circuit on transparency film and use it as a mask. After you've insulated the board, you dip it in acid (not as scary as it sounds) and you can have a board in like 30 minutes. After that you need to drill holes using a dremmel, or go with SMD components."

If not then you can use the three-component startup circuit shown (HERE).  Once the circuit starts up and node E rises above (Vxydivider - Vdiode), the startup circuit cuts off and injects ~ zero noise into node E.  Select Rx and Ry to have the correct Thevenin equivalent output voltage so the circuit will start up and then reverse-bias Dnew by at least 500mV when the supply voltage reaches +8.1 or so.  Also select Rx and Ry to have an appropriately low Thevenin equivalent output resistance so the circuit can supply the necessary startup current to drive all four resistors, even at low temperatures.

Essentially the transistor is a ""pass through"" at this point.   ""maximum power"" as the maximum amount of power the switching device can consume itself   This is running 0V to the base pin, causing the transistor to consume all of the power, heating it up greatly. This is the max dissipation or max power as usually defined in data sheets.  This is my mental model anyways. Sound correct based on your examples? If there's some terminology I have wrong, I'd love to be set right. Thanks!"
electronics,36k9x0,bradn,2,Wed May 20 13:19:47 2015 UTC,"Nope.  0V to the base pin means the transistor is off and no current is flowing.  No heat is being generated anywhere, except a tiny amount of leakage.  Also note that it is easier to model a BJT as being current driven - that is, the current through the base pin is controlling conduction (if you have a 5V source, you'd need to put a resistor between it and the base pin to control current, or else the junction can be burned up by base current).  Switching devices like BJTs and MOSFETs are most efficient when they are fully turned off, or fully turned on.  And for small voltages and currents, MOSFETs are more efficient than BJTs, because BJTs (like NPNs or PNPs) always have about .3V of voltage loss, causing (current * .3) watts of heat.  MOSFETs don't really have a bandgap caused voltage drop, and they get very close to 0V for good (usually expensive) parts, or very low currents."
electronics,36k9x0,antiquarian_bookworm,2,Wed May 20 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"You got it...  off = 0 Amps and 12 Volts across transistor  power = IxE = 0x12 = 0 Watts dissipated  on = 0.37 Amps and 0.3 Volts across transistor power = IxE = 0.37 x 0.3 = 0.11 Watts  You need at least a quarter Watt transistor.  The base current is not significant to the total heat for this design  If you ever dwell for too long between off and on, the transistor will get very hot. For example, at the midpoint of conduction...  half on = 0.18 Amps and 6 volts across transistor power = IxE = 0.18 x 6 = 1,1 Watts  But if you slam the transistor from ON state to OFF state completely and properly, power dissipation is minimal."
electronics,36k9x0,srqp,1 point,Wed May 20 17:14:01 2015 UTC,"You're right, I wasn't dissipating 4.5W at the time of writing. This is sort of a science experiment to me, and I'd like to be able to variably control the fans speed from max RPM running at 4.5W, to zero RPM running at 0W.  In the second example, would it be correct to say I am dissipating 4.5W? My transistor sure a heck gets hot when I do this."
electronics,36k9x0,pirate_phate,1 point,Wed May 20 13:22:57 2015 UTC,"In the second example you still aren't dissipating 4.5 W.  A basic way to think about it is your fan represents a load, which can be represented as a resistor, and your transistor is a small resistor in series with your load.  The current flowing through the two resistors is the same BUT the voltage across each of the two resistors are different.  Load resistance can be specified or calculated from voltage divided by current.  Transistor resistance can be found in the datasheet.  Your load should be much higher resistance and have the majority of the voltage across it.  That basic resistor divider model can be used to calculate the voltage across the transistor.  Power is equal to voltage difference times current.  As PWM duty cycle (amount of time on) decreases the power being dissipated decreases linearly if you assume power while off is negligible (a probably reasonable solution but can be calculated from the leakage current)."
electronics,36k9x0,fatangaboo,7,Thu May 21 21:22:21 2015 UTC,Ta is the ambient temperature and TC is the temperature of the IC package. From that I'd say the rating is 1.5W in free air without a heatsink and 12.5W if suitably heatsinked so the junction temp doesn't exceed the max on the data sheet of 150°C
electronics,36k9x0,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Wed May 20 00:35:04 2015 UTC,"Makes perfect sense, thank you!"
electronics,36k9x0,rainwulf,2,Wed May 20 02:00:38 2015 UTC,"TC = temperature of the CASE  Ta = Temperature of the AMBIENT air  The datasheet is telling you that if you mount the transistor package to an infinitely large heatsink which is kept at exactly 25 degrees C by internal liquid cooling, then you are allowed to dissipate 12.5 watts.  But if you leave the transistor unbolted to any heatsink, and operate it in 25 degree C still air, then you are only allowed to dissipate 1.5 watts.  I suggest you buy a D44H11 transistor (datasheet) {sales page} .  This transistor is allowed to dissipate 70 watts when the case temperature TC equals 25 degrees C.  It is allowed to dissipate 2 watts when there's no heatsink and the ambient air temperature Ta equals 25 degrees C.  Attach a small heatsink (like this one) whose thermal resistance is 5 degrees C per watt.  If the transistor burns 4.44 watts then the heatsink temperature will be (5 * 4.44) = 22.2 degrees above the air temperature.  If you operate this device in Tunisia in the summertime then the air is perhaps 60 Celsius, so the heatsink (and the transistor case) will be at 82.2 degrees C.  Now you simply look at the transistor datasheet (Figure 10) and see that when the case temperature is 82.2 degrees C, the max permitted power dissipation is 26 watts.  Since your gizmo only dissipates 4.44 watts, you have plenty of safety margin."
electronics,36k9x0,rainwulf,5,Wed May 20 00:48:08 2015 UTC,Any time you need to use a heatsink in an application like this you should at least consider using a mosfet and PWM control instead.

If you want one tool that does a bunch of open barrels, something like this might be superior (though worse for more than a few crimps at a time, as it doesn't ratchet, hard on the hands).

electronics,36is63,DJPhil,6,Tue May 19 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of the evaporation method described here, so I'll relate my experience.  Short bursts were used in various locations around a non-operational powered device. 'If I spray here it works' is often a sign of a bad mechanical connection that's improved due to local thermal contraction. That could be an intended mechanical connection like an IC in a socket or an unintended one like a cold solder joint or broken trace.  It's a rapid troubleshooting aid that's had a long run in radio, then TV, and some computer repair. Fast diagnosis is fast turnaround, and more money. The problem is that this method is potentially destructive, especially in modern stuff that isn't designed to have 100W of tube heaters going on and off with every power cycle. Components, traces, and bond wires are more fragile than they once were and don't tolerate the beating as well, and newer components like BGAs really don't appreciate thermal stress.  I prefer poking things with a stick and visual inspection. I've got a bag of kitchen skewers (like for kebabs), a bag of popsicle sticks, and plastic mechanical pencils with erasers for poking things that are operating. If you're looking for a bad joint on a board so large and with such small components that visual inspection and poking things would take too long (what are you working on?) I suppose you could use a rubber roller.  Just my two cents."

electronics,36is63,rainwulf,1 point,Tue May 19 23:19:15 2015 UTC,"Yea this. Poking joints i have found to be the best for finding cold solder joints, as the cold solder is often ""crystalised"" and weaker, and with a metal probe it often crumbles/bends away.   Then its simply desolder with wick/gun, IPA clean, resolder, and you're back in action!"
electronics,36is63,rainwulf,3,Wed May 20 04:03:52 2015 UTC,"You get the circuit working, then fire the spray at the joints. When the metal contracts due to the cold, the cold solder joints open up causing failure. You can also do the same thing with a heat gun.  The other way is that it would evaporate faster on high resistance joints, but that would depend on the actual current flow.  I have always found the best way to find cold solder joints is poke the joint with a sharp insulated object. The cold joints always seem to mechanically deform much easier, and often allows you to pinpoint the exact joint causing the issue as suddenly the circuit starts working again.  Always suspect any solder joint on high mechanical loads and high thermal loads as well as devices that have a lot of thermal inertia, relays, power devices, connectors."
electronics,36is63,WillBitBangForFood,2,Wed May 20 04:01:51 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of this method, but my guess would have to be that a cold solder joint, is not only electrically isolated, but also at the very least partially thermally isolated as well.  On a good solder joint, when you cool it down with the spray, there is a thermal path for the temperature to equalize (i.e along the trace or plane that the solder is connected to). On a cold joint, there is no path for that cold to dissipate, so you would notice that the spray does not evaporate away as quickly."
electronics,36is63,hellionzzz,5,Tue May 19 18:39:59 2015 UTC,"LOL  That was my first answer that I had to go back and fix. It's nearly the exact opposite.

This indicates a bad solder joint."

If the baseband is running on the CPU, if you broke the security on this phone, you could maybe reverse-engineer how it interfaces with the hardware, and then replace it with an open baseband.  If the baseband modem doesn't have a built-in processor, and it uses the application processor, the modem itself is probably a pretty dumb device, that does what the code on the application processor tells it to do.

electronics,36fnl6,nikomo,19,Tue May 19 02:46:40 2015 UTC,"Hey,  (Blog author here.) That's a really really good point, I hadn't thought about it from that angle. If you can remove the hypervisor and run the kernel directly on the hardware then you could, in theory, directly access the baseband peripherals' address space.  I'm not sure about the possibility of the existing baseband being a dumb device though. The point of the virtualisation stack, as I understand it, is to share the main processor's resources with the baseband processing requirements. So there could be quite a large software stack on the ""baseband"" side, with just a simple communication channel to the ""main"" kernel via the hypervisor.  But it's potentially a lot less opaque than a ""black box"" baseband processor."
electronics,36fnl6,nikomo,5,Tue May 19 02:56:57 2015 UTC,"The software stack on the baseband VM should be substantial, I was thinking if the hardware that the software is controlling, is dumb enough, it could be easier to drive it than usual.   The usual baseband modems are difficult to control because you don't get low level access.   If this is how it works, it could be possible to start thinking about it:  Baseband modem receives data over airwaves, constructs it into a frame. Sends it to the baseband VM, which processes it into your data packet, SMS etc., and then the data is handed to the Android VM.   If the software running in the VM is just a small message passing shim, and the modem hands the Android VM the usual data packets etc., through the shim, then it's a no-go.   I have no idea how to check any of that out. Kernel and driver sources would help. Oh wait, GPL violations. Yaaaaaay."
electronics,36fnl6,nikomo,3,Tue May 19 03:09:19 2015 UTC,"I have no idea how to check any of that out.   Yeah. The other investigation route would be getting low level enough access to dig around in the baseband code. The only ways ""in"" that I know of at the moment are at the Android kernel level, so stuck inside the VM. Would need to find a way to break into uboot."

electronics,36fnl6,s1egfried,7,Tue May 19 06:00:06 2015 UTC,"It seems to me like the author might be jumping to conclusions here. Just because the baseband is built into the SoC and some virtualisation seems to be used, it doesn't mean that there is no dedicated baseband processor.  Most smartphones are running some sort of secure OS on the main ARM cores in parallel with the main OS, using trustzone."
electronics,36fnl6,SarahC,8,Tue May 19 03:15:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you may well be right.

electronics,36fnl6,SarahC,4,Tue May 19 08:24:07 2015 UTC,"I feel sorry for that poor processor.   To start off, it's a reasonably underpowered cortex A5, then it's running a hypervisor with linux and (apparently) the baseband under it, maybe other things, who knows. And because linux is so short on ram, (200mb after the hyperviosr and other clients have taken their chunks) it only allocates 20mb as ram and the remaining 180mb as compressed swap space.  So there will be constant interruptions as pages have to be swapped in and out of memory and compressed/decompressed to make room for each other  and more interruptions while everything something is sent/received over GSM.  On the plus side, it is a dual core processor."
electronics,36hwhf,SepthSilver,2,Tue May 19 14:42:59 2015 UTC,"You're halfway there. You need a crystal clock circuit to replace the 555 timer with a precise 1hz clock signal.  Feed that signal to a 4017.  Then you need to cascade 4017 counters for each digit. So when the first 4017 goes from digit 9 to 0, that output is fed to the clock input of the next 4017. Since this is the tens column on your seconds, you need to feed the output 6 to the reset of the 4017, and feed that into the clock input of a third 4017 counter (your one minute digit).  Repeat for the ten minute digit, the one hour digit, then the ten hour digit.  You can feed a manual clock inputs (button or 555 timer) to each 4017 ones digit in order to set each digit.   That's the basic hardware approach. You might be able to find a more elegant software solution. You might also be able to reverse engineer a cheap/old alarm clock and feed the inputs to the seven segment display controller (4511?) to what will likely be a binary-decimal converter circuit."

There is 12Wh of energy in the battery and boost converter will be ~90% efficient so that leaves you with at least 10Wh to play with. Your fan needs 1.8W so you should get around 5.5-6 hours or so of runtime.  Not crazy idea? 1.2Ah lead-acid battery. It will run that fan for around 8 hours.

Attach a 9v battery snap (same page) to the 8 cell holder, then wire the 9v battery wires to the fan. Put a switch in between the batteries and fan if you want.   Each AA outputs 1.5 volts DC, so you need 8 batteries total to get 12 volts DC. The fan says it needs 12 vdc and uses 0.15 amps.    And here's a small 12v battery."

After some use, if you notice its not lasting long enough. You could go the rechargable route using a lithium-ion battery, It works great, lasts longer, and is fully rechargeable. Plus the charger will work for other projects you might use other Li-ion batteries for. It is more expensive up front, but may be cheaper in the long run. You decide!! I have used this battery to power a small screen whose voltage was marked as 12v, (it actually had a dropout voltage of 6v) and it works great and lasts long. Anyways...

So small that you could secure them to 3 sides of the fan and the total package will hardly be bigger than the fan itself.  These little guys for example -- paired with these connectors.  3x 160mAh in series will run your 150mA fan for about an hour.  3x 3.7V = 11.1V.  Fully charged these cells give 4.2V x3 = 12.6V (a bit over 12V, but this won't hurt that fan at all; these LiPos can handle a much higher discharge rate so they'll be fine too)  Most cities have at least one RC hobby shop so you can get these parts locally and inexpensively (the chargers are relatively inexpensive, too)."

electronics,36irza,Seedy_Seltzer,2,Tue May 19 18:29:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. However, if you want a few absolutely basic pointers on how they work, look up an introduction to microcontrollers.  The basics are that you have digital i/o pins for writing/reading high/low voltage for what's called ""logic."" You've got analog input pins for reading variable voltages, often useful for sensors. All components have ""datasheets,"" which are useful sets of information on specs and usage. There are different protocols for communication, such as UART (usb for your computer), serial (SPI), and i2c. Microprocessors typically are programmed over serial, so you need to use a UART to serial converter to program them; this is the whole reason people use Arduino and other development boards- they break out the digital and analog pins for easy access and have integrated power management and UART/serial converters so you can just slap that puppy into a USB slot on your laptop and tell it what to do by downloading a program you've written in what's called an IDE, an interactive development environment. I've never personally played around with the Atmel Studio, I think the Arduino IDE is perfectly sufficient for beginners (especially because the Arduino site has nice tutorials with images that reference their IDE).  edit: I just realized you don't want to use Arduino.

electronics,36irza,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Tue May 19 20:00:44 2015 UTC,"What's the problem with Arduino? I'm planning to do my first microprocessor hardware project soon (technically it is second, but I'm not counting this one I did 35 years ago in college, since so much has changed since then). It's a weather station, using these sensors plus temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors not yet picked out.  My first plan was to use a TI Tiva Series C TM4C123G Launchpad, with the CC3100 BoosterPack to get it on the internet to upload the weather data to a server. I have this hardware lying about as a consequence of having recently taken the ""Embedded Systems - Shape the World"" class that UT Austin offers online through EdX.  But (1) that hardware is serious overkill for this, and (2) a couple months ago I got licensed for amateur radio, and now can foresee all kinds of microprocessor based ham projects in my future for which the Tiva Launchpad would be a useful and convenient prototyping platform.  What I've been thinking about instead is an AVR ATTiny84 or ATTiny85 (depending on how many I/O pins I end up needing). Although not fully Arduino compatible, my understanding is that they are close enough that you can develop software on an Arduino, avoiding certain features, and then flash it on a properly prepared ATTiny84 or 85. (Also, I'm on a Mac, and Arduino tools work well on Macs, I'm told, without a lot of messing around and tweaking).  So I was thinking of an Arduino Uno (and some kind of WiFi accessory) for initial prototyping, where I get the software working and all the sensor interfaces worked out using the Arduino and a breadboard.  Then the software moves to an ATTiny8x, and I make sure things still work. When that is all happy, I figure out how I'm going to build something more permanent with the ATTiny8x.  (I've seen someone take a similar approach, except instead of an ATTiny8x, he was using the same processor most Arduinos use, so when he was happy with the software, he just popped the processor out of the Uno socket and used it in the final project, and bought a new processor for his Uno).  What am I giving up or what limits am I imposing on myself if I take this approach?"

It excels at the task for which it was designed: to enable artists and other non-engineers to rapidly prototype interactive designs.  Arduino does this, in large part, by hiding as much of the complexity of the microprocessor and surrounding electronics as much as possible.  The focus of Arduino is always on the product, never the technology or the process.  The problem comes when people attempt to use Arduino to learn about microcontrollers, because now you are attempting to use Arduino for a purpose it was never designed for.  Although OP never stated his goals, I believe he is probably requesting something other than Arduino because his goals are actually to learn about embedded development rather than simply create a product.  It appears as if you have a specific product in mind, and getting that running is your priority.  In that context, using an Arduino may be an appropriate choice."

electronics,36irza,antiquarian_bookworm,3,Tue May 19 22:32:19 2015 UTC,"Your guides should be documentation and tools.  1) documentation  The choices in microprocessors these days boil down to ARM and everything else.  The ARM architecture and instruction set is pretty well documented via the ARM website. ARM is sort of like the Borg these days, but if you want documentation, they are pretty good.   I have worked on many other chip architectures over the last 30+ years and documentation is always the thing that sets one apart over the others.  The major vendors, ST, Freescale, NXP, TI, etc. all supply documentation for the chips they fab.  I have had the best luck with ST chips.  Apart from the instruction set of the processor, the documentation for the chip will include information on the peripherals on chip and how to program them.  Before buying a dev board, make sure that you have programming manual(s) for every bit of logic in the chip.  2) tools - software tools and start code.  Many chip vendors depend on an IDE provided by another vendor.  I'm old school and like to use GCC/GDB.  I'm an outlier.  Many of these IDEs are time or size limited.  You need to check that out.  The libraries the chip vendor supplies are important.  Some of them provide a chip set up tool of some sort to generate code for a particular application.  For example, what is the clock source?  How fast will you run the chip?  Documentation about clock sources, setting up PLLs in the clock tree and other like information is very important.  Make sure your chip vendor has that documenation available.  The chip setup tool from Freescale generated code where the bit and register names in the 'c' and 'h' files matched the documentation.  It can be very frustrating when code from the vendor uses one set of names in code and another set of names in the docs.  I have experienced situations where bit and register names were not the same in all of the documentation and code.  That was frustrating.    ST provides a lot of firmware libraries which demonstrate how to use all of the parts of the chip, eg, communication ports, setting up DAC/ADC channels, DMA, etc.    ST has a lot of small boards that are quite good.  The Nucleo set are nice and are supported by an online IDE.  There is a Bluetooth addon board for them as well.  Some of the boards have small LCDs.  Others have gyroscopes and compasses.  Your steps should be:  0) How to set up clocks 1) What happens when the chip comes out of reset? 2) What peripherals do you need and how to program them?  Typically, after 0) I write some code and have the chip come out of reset and toggle an LED for me in a loop forever.  That will give me an idea of whether or not I have understood the clocks correctly.  I like to go for a one second on, one second off loop.  Then I turn on peripherals and blink the LED after each one.  That way, if something fails, I can see it.  Or you can use an IDE and a debugger. :)"

If you go to Digi-Key, (my primary place to search for parts), and search for ""buck converter"", and then narrow it to internal-switch ICs, you get 7,830 parts. Some of those are duplicates, but there are surely 1,000 unique solutions.  Are some of those parts good, and some bad? No, they're all good. There are just a lot of different problems out there, and the solutions are equally diverse.  Maybe you want to run your circuit on a coin cell. Maybe it has to survive high temperature. Maybe it has to cost 10 cents. There are a lot of things to consider.  It would be great if you could condense all of the knowledge involved in circuit design to a single sheet (or a phone app, I suppose). I haven't seen that yet."

When working with electronics it is a very good idea to be working on several projects at the same time so you can always have one project to work on while you are waiting on parts for others.  This is particularly important once you start using PCBs.

electronics,36g9s4,dfg45et,3,Tue May 19 04:44:20 2015 UTC,Are you trying to power a 250mW laser diode ? Those are so dangerous it's not even funny. I've worked with 5mW diodes and even then I'd wear protective glasses as just the reflected beam would be enough to cause permanent injuries (lower intensity light can still cause long term AMD). Don't you mean 250uW ?
electronics,36g9s4,Elukka,3,Tue May 19 09:11:26 2015 UTC,"AMD is probably more of an issue with purple and blue lasers than with red or green ones though. Scattered reflections from 5 mW diodes are not really an issue anyway. If you're worried about those, then you should be much more worried of looking into bright LEDs, especially the blue ones."
electronics,36g9s4,dfg45et,1 point,Tue May 19 12:05:24 2015 UTC,"Well OP didn't specify the wavelength. I may not remember 100% correctly, however purple which is closer to UV, is absorbed by the melanin and will cause sunburn/cataract. Red light and IR are absorbed by the retina and will cause AMD or similar issues. I'd not recommend staring at the reflection of a laser, the light doesn't scatter as much as a standard LED. Even 1mW is still pretty bright."
electronics,36g9s4,Elukka,2,Tue May 19 12:49:59 2015 UTC,"According to the current understanding it's blue light (short wavelength light) that especially causes eye damage and assumably AMD.  Here's Osram's Details on Photobiological Safety of LED Light Sources (.pdf).   the light doesn't scatter as much as a standard LED   It depends on the surface I suppose but usually the beam of a laser is very collimated and comparable power densities in a beam are hard to achieve with leds unless you have powerful optics. So yeah, laser beams and their spots can be dangerous.   With leds frightening amounts of power can be absorbed by your retina, if you stare at a naked high power led chip. Intentionally staring at a fully powered royal-blue, blue or turquoise 3W LED chip is a very bad idea. The optical power is substantial and the led chip is tiny so the ""hot spot"" on your retina will be very brightly lit. The blue light danger in these cases is significant even if it's not that painful to look at the leds."
electronics,36g9s4,dfg45et,1 point,Tue May 19 21:38:18 2015 UTC,"Interesting, thank you for sharing that document. I guess the melanin (iris) is just outside the absorption range of purple light. IR or near IR light is used for OCT so we know for a fact that it is not absorbed by the cornea/iris."

Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence interferometry, typically employing near-infrared light.

electronics,36ecku,Fulcro,1 point,Tue May 19 06:40:50 2015 UTC,"Short answer: maybe. First, those diodes aren't packaged for use at that frequency, or even above 100 GHz (they're too large for waveguide integration, and there's no simple way to mount them in any planar circuit technology). Second, that spec may be these diodes' cutoff frequency - which is an order of magnitude lower than PIN diodes that are usually used at millimeter-wave frequencies. You should try to find the entire datasheet on these devices.. if someone has translated it from Russian.  Finally, how much ENR are you after, at 20 GHz? How are you going to measure it? How are you going to fabricate and package it? (waveguide, planar topology, etc.)"

In mosfets you usually get a choice of low Rds or low gate charge/gate capacitance but this is not always the case either.  If you are willing to spend, you can purchase devices that have both low Rds and low capacitance.  The tradeoff, of course, is between spending your money on an expensive mosfet or a cheap mosfet and an external gate driver.  Or, you could just choose a different LED driver chip with a better gate driver internally.  What really annoys me here is that TI has dumbed this application down to the point where even a novice building their first circuit is confused because TI thought that they wouldn't be able to understand the concept of gate charge on a mosfet."

electronics,36dnqq,Freshfish28,2,Mon May 18 16:10:12 2015 UTC,"Depends on the MOSFET.  There are tiny low power ones that would pop under 1A and there are beefy ones that can handle hundreds of amps.  A MOSFET rated in excess of the current you anticipate putting through it will work fine.  10W at 12V is less than 1A, so not a lot of power really.  Most decent MOSFETs will handle at least 5-10A, often more.  Just make sure you use a MOSFET driver IC rather than just a resistor pull up/down and an Arduino pin if you plan to switch at high frequency.  A MOSFET is efficient only when the gate is fully charged or discharged, when it is in transition the resistance is high and will create heat if you're loading it hard.  Even well within its rated current you can burn a MOSFET by switching it too slowly.  A MOSFET driver uses an H bridge to very quickly charge and discharge the gate with relatively high current, making for cooler, more efficient, and non destructive operation."

electronics,36dnqq,CalcProgrammer1,1 point,Mon May 18 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"If you're PWMing at low frequency (<100Hz, maybe <1KHz depending on load and FET) you can just hook the PWM out to the gate with a pull up (assuming low side N-channel FET confoguration).  The issue with higher frequency is that the higher you go, the more time you spend in transition and thus the more heating occurs.  If your load is high this heat could burn out the FET.  I had this happen making a high current motor driver.  The solution here would be a MOSFET driver IC which goes between the PWM pin and the FET gate.  Try the first case, if you burn the FET then look at the latter.  You can also use heatsinks to dissipate the heat.  Also, what kind of light is it?  Fluorescent lights usually don't take well to PWM due to having a starter.  LEDs and incandescents are fine (so long as the LEDs are direct and don't have their own power supply)."

electronics,36dgts,I_am_Bob,3,Mon May 18 15:20:32 2015 UTC,The amount of energy needed to create a EMP that can actually affect a significant area is huge. Like nuclear bomb huge. And non-nuclear EMP's are quite difficult to build. Basically the odds of a weaponized EMP being used on you are like zero.   Natural EMPS from lighting and Solar flairs are more likely to affect the grid than personal or small scale electronics. Also most electronics have surge protection built in or you can get surge protectors for your house.   Basically you are worrying about something that's extremely unlikely to happen.

I'd imagine the latest 4K TVs probably use a newer technology, but any current consumer monitor probably uses LVDS.  You could try looking up datasheets for chips within the monitor to see if there are any mentions of LVDS, but otherwise it's a bit hard to tell without a really high-end oscilloscope!

electronics,368ruc,ai_maker,3,Sun May 17 07:15:01 2015 UTC,"I understood most of this explanation for years and years but it still didn't help me visualize what all the nodes were doing in a great way until a guy in my department gave me a geometrical way of thinking about them.  Think of how you can describe a plane in 3space with a vector describing its normal direction and distance from the origin. Now imagine all input points well above the plane are output as ""good"" and all points well below are ""bad."" There is a transfer function that interpolates points in the region near the transition plane; maybe this function goes from good to bad very suddenly or maybe it's very fuzzy. Multiple transition planes can be defined to constrain the ""good"" area to a more complicated region of space. A simple neural net's node coefficients define this good/bad geometry. Input a point in n-space, the nodes evaluate the appropriate transfer function outputs, and you can get ""how good"" the point is in one or more output criteria. Training is a matter of starting with arbitrary planes, and slowly reorienting them until they get good results, much like aiming an antenna until the optimum signal is detected."
electronics,368ruc,kaihatsusha,2,Sun May 17 11:03:07 2015 UTC,Isn't the point of neural networks that they transform the space so that those planes become curved as necessary?

That's also what you can see in the typical XOR problem as is shown in the post, provided that you employ a non-linear activation function. That gives neural nets their learning power. Otherwise (linear activations) the (hyper-)planes are flat.

electronics,366xv1,anothernoob777,2,Sun May 17 01:15:21 2015 UTC,"I would just like to say your first assumptions were correct. You can just plug it into the appropriate pins on an Arduino (Serial TX/RX) and it WILL just work, so long as your Arduino is 3.3v. The most common, cheapest boards are esp-01 and require that you connect   CH_PD -> 3.3v VCC -> 3.3v GND -> GND shared with arduino RX -> TX on Arduino TX -> RX on Arduino  Leave other pins disconnected for now. Not connecting ch_pd to 3.3v is a common mistake.   Do not connect the module to a 5v arduino unless you use a logical level shifter or you will break it. When you break the esp it will get hot :( I broke a few due to powersupply issues.  Make sure that the 3.3v is coming from a source that can give it anough current to run, that could be several hundred mv, if you connect it to the 3.3v output from the arduino, it will most likely not be able to draw enough current so MAY appear to work, but you wont get far with it. Build your own 3.3v regulated supply with an LD1117V33 don't be put off its simple to do. http://html.alldatasheet.com/html-pdf/94435/STMICROELECTRONICS/LD1117V33C/8140/5/LD1117V33C.html see page5, you'll need 2 capacitors.  Get a cheap Arduino 3.3v nano/mini? on ebay, $3!!!!  You should not need to reflash the firmware unless you come accross a bug in the presupplied firmware image on the esp module. Entually you will want to but that comes later ;)  If you decide to get a usb->serial board get the ftdi one that is 3.3v and 5v switchable, they are very cheap on ebay. Be careful the labeled 3.3v output may not be 3.3v, check it. Even if it is 3.3v it may not provide enough current to run the module correctly.  Be careful with ttl logical shifters 5<->3.3v SOME are not birectional on all channels so you need to read the documentation.  Note, that the esp will talk serial but depending on the firmware, they may be 9600 8n1 or 115200 8n1, you will have to play to find out the correct values. When you first apply power the esp will say something on the serial so you should be able to tell if you have the speed correct.  Good luck, have fun.

Also what is a ""LD1117V33 LDO Regulator 3.3V 0.8A"" and why do I need it?  About getting power to the esp8266, can I not just use two 1.5V AA batteries? They should supply enough current and be of the correct voltage."

They think that the electricity comes out of the positive wire and don't understand the purpose of the ground or return. The difference between charge, voltage, current, energy, and power. They will often use voltage and current interchangeably. They will also misunderstand the effects of each, such as confusing voltage with capacity in a battery. Non-linear behavior. The emphasis on Ohm's Law seems to lead people to think that voltage and current always share a linear relationship, causing them to misunderstand simple things like why an LED needs a current limiting resistor."

electronics,364x4t,piranha,7,Sat May 16 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"My first attempt at organizing these things was to use wall-mounted bin drawers (like the Akro-Mils 10164: http://amzn.com/B000LDH3JC).  Each drawer had a divider wall that could be inserted, to divide the drawer into two separated spaces.  I used that feature to minimize the number of drawers needed.  The resistors were sorted by value (like I'm doing now).  This approach had problems: the biggest issue was that if I bought a new value of resistor, I would need to move all the larger-valued resistors down one space in order to make room, which I'd need to do to keep the order correct.  Wouldn't be such a big deal if I hadn't doubled-up into each drawer; with one drawer dedicated to each value, I could have just moved each drawer as a whole.  But since I did double-up values on drawers, I'd have to move one drawer-half into the next drawer, but only after doing the same thing for each of the successive drawer-halves.  Another issue is that axial resistor leads would sometimes creep underneath the separator and wiggle it up, until it might slip through entirely.  (This was with a different brand than Akro-Mils, so don't take this as an indictment of their product; that was just an example.)  I didn't maintain this system, so I had a few bags of other-valued resistors floating around.  I've seen suggestions about using baseball card organizers (the kind that go into 3-ring binders) to organize parts.  That's pretty much comparable to my old approach, in that you'd need to shift stuff around whenever you add to the collection.  I'm really into my current approach because I can insert new values ""cheaply,"" without any special effort: just insert a new envelope in its correct place.  At the worst, I might need to rebalance the bin contents if one of them gets too stuffed, but that's not hard, and it doesn't involve giving special care to each envelope, just picking up a handful at the end of one bin and moving them to the start of the next bin (or vice versa).  This is also a bit cheaper (in dollars and space) than wall-mounted drawers.  I picked up these bins from Dollar Tree; they're sold as 13.5""-long drawer organizers.  I got the envelopes at Staples; they're called ""No. 1 Coin envelopes,"" and are the size of a business card.  They cost around $5-10 for the pack of 250 I bought, if I remember correctly.  I'd done a test run with my smaller set of capacitors.  Works well for anything that isn't too thick (I don't keep my electrolytics in these envelopes).  I'm pretty sure I stole this idea from someone else, but I don't recall where I'd read about it.  Hope this helps!"

Back then, they mostly used ruby lasers and some used yags. (I believe the modern ones use laser diodes - they just started experimenting with them at the time.)  In addition to the laser itself there were a pair of mirrors driven by galvos, a module with a piezoelectric crystal used to ""turn off"" the beam (it would actually just deflect the beam so it wouldn't come out of the projector - these types of lasers couldn't be turned on and off rapidly like laser diodes) and a sensor module that could detect if the beam bounced back (we'd use retroreflective dots for tracking the projection surface.)

Diode lasers would also be a fun project.   If what you have IS in fact an Nd:YAg, no there is no gas involved. It is a solid state laser, meaning it has a solid crystalline rod.   Bottom line.... DO NOT TURN IT ON UNLESS YOU HAVE PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISION! I would hate for an accident to happen to you.   You will also need proper eye protection and a safe environment to run it.

Safety is paramount when using lasers. 2/3: It depends. This laser in particular needs support equipment (modelocking controller, water cooling) and has specific power supply requirements (that being pulsed 1500v powering a big honking flashlamp). 4: Solid state lasers are solid state, so all the lasing is provided by the rod and whatever's pumping it.

The high voltage power supply could also be damaged.  4) yes sealed gas lasers are filled with patented mixtures of gases and catalysts, these gas mixtures can be very specific and include specific isotopes of the gases; as a result almost all cheap laser tubes are sealed and meant to be disposable and or recharged by professionals. In the case of a small helium neon laser the tubes are only replaced.  if you guys are interested I can dig up some links on the subject..."

The one mounted at an angle before the Q-switch assembly makes more sense, because that could be catching a back reflection. What did this come out of? Were there any markings on the case? Do you know the repetition rate or the pulse width? If it is a really short pulse (ps or fs), then the acousto-optic modulators /u/Thing_in_a_box mentioned are a possibility.   Most of the smaller nanosecond Nd:YAG lasers I have worked on (Continuum, Quanta-Ray and Spectra Physics mainly) have not had much in the way of on-board feedback diagnostics.

The only issue I have with this thought is if the mirror isn't mounted perfectly in plane with the mirror mount alignment screws then rotating the mirror will cause it's angle to change as the mirror indexes.

Depending on position of that rheostat it's between 0.0955 V_{in} - 0.06 and 0.094 V_{in} - 0.04. It's obviously fixed by trimming R7 to ""fit the meter range"".  Edit: Output impedance of MCP9700 is 20 Ohm up to 100 uA according to datasheet, so that side should be fine."
electronics,362q35,partisann,1 point,Sat May 16 04:43:30 2015 UTC,"The output is 1mV / 1C, although there is some error over temperature.  R1 and R2 are used to intentionally drop the voltage output of U2b from 1.2V to 500mV at the input of R3. For calibration, the MCP9700 was replaced with a bench power supply to simulate the voltage output from the MCP9700 at room temperature (25 C); the trimpot R2 was adjusted for the appropriate output on pin 1 of the op amp.   Plugging in the numbers using the more complex diff amp formula, the output of the op amp is 0mV when the voltage from the MCP9700 is 500mV (0 degrees C) and trimpot R2 is adjusted to 54K ohms. This is just over mid-range for the trimpot, which roughly agrees with my current trimpot setting.  This does introduce some error; running the numbers, there is about a 1mV (1 degree C) error over a +-20 degree C range. The MCP9700 datasheet claims a +-1 degree C accuracy over a limited temperature range centered around room temp; the additional error of the op amp could help or hinder the final reading, depending on which way it goes. But as this is just for use in a more-or-less temperature controlled lab, it's certainly ""good enough"".   Pin 1 of the op amp is tied directly to the output terminals of the analog meter; at the end of the video, you can see one my multimeters reading the voltage from pin 1, which is 19.6mV (19.6 C, or 67.3 F), while my second multimeter shows a temperature reading of 68 F from its thermistor."

electronics,361hlg,MOX-News,19,Fri May 15 08:34:20 2015 UTC,"The transistor is being switched on and off - if you look at the transistor as a zero Ohm resistor when it has a base current applied and an infinite Ohm resistor (remove the components from your schematic to make this mental analysis easier if it helps) when it has no base current applied it will help you analyse the operation.  It may help to get a datasheet of the/an NPN transistor to identify the pins.  Let's start with the battery being connected to the circuit.   The transistor is switched off as there is no base current. This means that no current can flow between the collector (top of transistor) and emitter (bottom of transistor) meaning the coil is not energised. Instead the current will flow through R1 and into the base of the transistor.  When the current hits the base of the transistor it will switch on, allowing current to flow through the coil. However this will not be for very long as the impedance of the powered transistor is now tiny (let's assume zero Ohms). This means that the path of R1 will now be unused as the current has a much easier path through the transistor.  Since there is no current through R1 any more the base current of the transistor is not present, switching off the transistor and cutting the current flow to the coil.  Current can now flow through R1 as the transistor is presenting itself as having infinite impedance. This will switch on the transistor and the cycle continues."
electronics,361hlg,TomAskew,18,Fri May 15 08:58:48 2015 UTC,"I think important point to add to your explanation is the presence of coil.

electronics,361hlg,justfarmingdownvotes,9,Fri May 15 19:21:23 2015 UTC,"it's a relaxation oscillator.  when you first apply power, the transistor is partially turned on via the 1k resistor.  Current rises in the transformer, and the voltage at the far end of the 1k resistor increases, turning the transistor on even harder.  At some point, current cannot increase anymore.  When this happens, the voltage at the 1k drops a bit, and the transistor starts to limit the current.  This causes the voltage at the 1k to drop even further, turning the transistor off completely while the magnetic field collapses.  Once the field has collapsed, return to step 1 - the transistor turns on a bit via the 1k.  It's basically the same circuit as the joule thief, but using an autotransformer"
electronics,361hlg,triffid_hunter,2,Fri May 15 09:24:09 2015 UTC,"Essentially what /u/triffid_hunter wrote. If you're wondering where the feedback comes from? By applying the power supply as center tap to the solenoid the base current is modulated by the EMF induction by created by the dH/dt of the part of the solenoid that goes into the collector.  As long as the transistor current is not saturated there's positive current feedback into the R base emitter circuit. Once the transistor goes into saturation magnetic field becomes steady, thereby the induced current breaking down and since the means a net drop in voltage due to parasitic capacitances this even results in a small reverse current you've to add, thereby pulling the transistor out of saturation. This in turn gives inductive feedback to further reduce the base emitter current until the transistor ""saturates"" in the nonconductive regime. At which point the whole cycle begins anew."

All CRT TVs look a bit like this (see link), and the charge is stored inside the TV tube. The only access to this charge is via the grey suction cap.  To make very sure it's discharged you need to connect the bare wiring draped across the back of the glass to the clip under that suction cap.  More correctly the charge is stored between the coating on the inside of the tube and the coating on the outside, and to discharge it those two coatings need to be connected briefly.   At most the voltage present will be 35,000 volts, which will jump a inch and a half.  It won't kill you - the current is too low, but it really hurts.

Actually it's exactly a capacitor, and intended to be one, it's the final reservoir for the high voltage multiplier.   The internal conductive layer is aluminium, the glass is the dielectric, and the outer coating is almost always AquaDAG.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquadag   The outer coating isn't a very good conductor, perhaps 100 ohms per square or more.  The front face is connected to the internal coating.

electronics,361hms,38Super,0,Fri May 15 22:58:55 2015 UTC,"I'm an electronic engineer with 40+ years experience   That's nice. People in an industry for a long period of time still make false statements.   I have been zapped occasionally, still here.   This demonstrates nothing other than luck. You will also come across electricians who say they've grabbed the 240v line occasionally and are still here. You will also find marines who've been shot in the chest and didn't die. The conclusion to draw from that is not ""Getting shot won't kill you, it just really hurts.""  There are many situations you could be shocked by 35,000v and not die. Same as closing your eyes in traffic, laying on the horn and blasting through a red light. I wouldn't go endorsing that behavior though.   Actually it's exactly a capacitor, and intended to be one   Yes, technically correct. It has capacitance. What I meant was, in the context of giving advice that you wait a few days after unplugging it and it's safe (fair advice for capacitors in consumer goods)... the rule of thumb for safety is not like the rule for capacitors. Hence, ""it's not like a capacitor"".   it's only 35kV until you get in the way, then it's much, much lower. Consider a Tazer/Stun Gun. These are always quoted at 50kV or whatever, and big arc's shown. Doesn't sound nearly as impressive when you find it's only 600-1200 volts when in contact with your skin. It's not the voltage that causes the immobilising effect, it's the special waveform.   I'm fairly confident this is also false.  You are correct in your knowledge but not in the context of how you apply it.  The reason a stun gun does not kill you is because the HV power supply is not capable of maintaining the HV when you are part of the circuit. If Ohms law holds, it would have to be capable of many amps, which it can't, so for Ohm's law to not break, the voltage has to choke.  A stun gun is specifically designed to take advantage of this and be less lethal. It wants high voltage to make contact with you easily, but low ability to sustain that voltage so it doesn't fry the victim.  On a static charge, like a capacitor or a CRT tube, it does not have a problem making Ohm's law work. It can and will dump all it's energy into whatever Ohm's law says it should. 100 amps flowing? No problem.  What saves you is the same thing that saves you when you zap yourself on a doorknob... not that the voltage (10,000v) drops, not that the current isn't high... but that the energy that was stored is rapidly depleted as the discharge goes on (voltage declines as a square as energy is drained). In the case of a doorknob zap.. it's lethal current for about 1 millionth of a second which isn't long enough to actually be lethal. In a CRT, the capacitance is much greater and so is the danger.   Bit short of engineering facts here. The spasm caused by a HV shock can/does hurt, but fatal - no.   I think it's you who's short on engineering facts. How much more basic does it need to be than Ohm's law and the fundamentals of capacitance? You are seriously endorsing the claim that high voltage is only capable of being painful, not deadly?   I agree, it's not too likely to be deadly, but only because the shock is unlikely to be across the heart, and unlikely to have enough energy stored to continue the current needed to be fatal for a long enough period of time. Which means the more common danger is whatever the muscle spasm makes you do.   TV tubes with an edge band don't implode, they just collapse.   Okay, well, you're splitting hairs over the precise meaning of the term ""implode"". I've not heard of the term ""collapse"" to mean anything other than the colloquial sense of it falls apart under gravity.  It's a brittle enclosure under a vacuum. When it's punctured, if it shatters, the much higher outside air pressure will shove the fragments inwards at high velocity until pressure is equalized. If your term for that is ""collapse"" because it's not enough to ""implode"", then okay, but, it's not in the same realm of safety as something mundane like hitting a wine bottle with a hammer or throwing a rock at a window. There's a vacuum."

electronics,35zb7r,GingerNic,14,Thu May 14 19:47:22 2015 UTC,"This becomes very easy when you just break it up into a simple first order HPF and then into a separate gain stage.  The corner frequency of the RC high pass filter as you know is given by 1/(2PIRC). Just pick a nominal value for the cap of 10xF and fill in the blanks to get the resistance you need for 85Hz.  For analysing the op amp gain stage you can figure it out intuitively if you remember that text book ideal op-amps will always have the same voltage in the inverting and non-inverting inputs. that is to say if you apply feedback from the output an op amp to an input, it will actually adjust its output until both of its inputs are back to the same voltage.  If you look at the output of the op-amp their is a simple voltage divider, the mid point of which will output a certain ratio of the op-amp output back into the inverting input of the op amp based on the ratio of R1 to R2.   For instance if R1 = R2 then the voltage divider would feedback half the voltage of the output into the inverting input. As the op amp wants V+ = V-, if 1V is applied to V+, it would need to output 2V so that the voltage divider would feedback 1V into the V- input so that V+ = V-.  As for the maths to calculate the gain all you need to know that formula for a voltage divider is given as Vin * R2/(R1+R2). (Note that in out example Vin of the voltage divider is the Vout of the op amp!) and gain is Vout/Vin and you can then simply derive the formula for any gain of this type of non-inverting op-amp as 1 + R1/R2."
electronics,35zb7r,jaywastaken,6,Thu May 14 23:54:20 2015 UTC,For a non inverting op-amp:  Vout = (1 + R1/R2) * Vin  Edit: also see http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_6.html

electronics,35zb7r,ModernRonin,2,Fri May 15 02:57:41 2015 UTC,"In case it isn't obvious to OP...  The 187 nF cap comes from the formula:  Fcut = 1/(2piRC)   Which is how you calculate the cutoff/corner/3dB frequency for a passive RC filter of the type we're using here.  We know Fcut must be 85 Hz (the problem tells us so), and I chose R to be 10k (because I had already used a 10k in the gain stage). I solved the formula for C and got:  C = 1 / (2pi*R*Fcut) C = 1 / (2*pi*10,000*85) C = .000000187 Farads   Or 187 nF.  In reality, of course, you probably aren't going to find a 187 nF capacitor. The nearest ""standard"" value is probably going to be 220 nF.  So, doing the math again, this time solving for R:  R = 1/(2pi*85*.00000022) R =  8510.95952   Or about 8.51k. This puts us pretty much equidistant between the two nearest standard 1% values, which are 8.45 and 8.66.  Depending on how much we care about getting Fcut exactly right, we could do a couple things...  First, we could make the resistor out of a series combination of other resistors. One combination of 1% standard resistors that gets us close is 7.5k and 1.0k. We can compute the error: 8.5 / 8.51 = 0.998824912, or about 99.8825%. This is about 0.1175% error - way less than the 1% error that's inherent in our 1% resistors. So that's great.  So, if you want, change the 187n and 10k resistor in the above simulation to a 220n and series combination of 7.5k and 1k, then check that the output voltages for the two frequency sources haven't changed noticeably.  Second, we could go to the next ""standard"" capacitor value, 330nF, and see what R we get:  R = 1/(2pi*85*.00000033) R = 5673.97302   Let's just call it 5674 for round numbers. The nearest 1% standard value is 5.62k, which is damn near exactly 1% low. (5620 / 5674 = 0.990482904). So that will be fine too."

For getting a job in the elections industry and making it past the initial human resources qualifications screenings, don't rule out the fact that most large companies require higher educational degrees. Shop if you want to work at Intel or Siemens or wherever, 99% of the time you'll need a 4 year degree to even get the chance for an interview.   Though people like Bill Gates never finished college, he got into the industry because they started their own companies that took off. They tinkered in their garages and met other hacker electronics gurus, and together formed their companies. If it was easy, we would all be CEO's of multi-billion dollar companies.  Steve Jobs just sold whatever Steve Wozniak made. Wozniak was the true technical genius behind Apple. Perhaps read into him and his biography for inspiration and the technical thought processes he employed when he designed the Apple I and Apple II computers. He was very passionate about his designs and was, in my opinion, a true electronics genius.  I'm rambling, but here are my suggestions, even if I'm a bit late to answer your original post:  1) Learn by doing. The books you are considering are pretty good.   2) Constantly be looking at all kinds of information to learn from. Read books. Read magazines. My favorite technical magazine is Circuit Cellar, which is about embedded design. They give articles about technical ideas, projects based off those ideas, and example schematics and code to show how the article writer achieved the goal.  3) Realize there is more than one way to do things. There is always room for improvements. Therefore, constantly keep reading and learning about electronics any chance you get.  4) Practice. Fail. Learn. Practice again. Repeat.  5) To get your inspiration and put your mind in the right focus, read about other electronics professionals. Steve Wozniak, like I mentioned above. Read about what NASA is doing. Read about what DARPA is doing. Read as much transparent, technical, but non-politically charged news about technology as you can. Avoid sensational news about technology, a la Elon Musk. That guy is crazy. He is smart in some ways, a visionary, but he is also a businessman on the global stage of world business. He is a figurehead, a performer, so take what he says and others in that same situation with a grain of salt. Stay as technical and transparent in your news as possible.  6) Don't rule out community college or university. Although it is expensive, a piece of paper with an official stamp on it will open doors. You aren't paying for knowledge, you are paying for a golden ticket. Be smart and practice on your own, but also be smart in case you want a job in the electronics indusry. Pay attention to what is required or what will quickly get you to where you want to be.  7) Be passionate about it. If you want to do electronics either as a hobby or as a job, don't kid yourself. You will be happiest if you truly are into it and aren't afraid to tackle information that seems confusing at first. Other people will also pick up on your optimism and energy, and will typically respond well to you if you are enthusiastic.  8) Don't neglect public speaking and debate skills. If you make an awesome product people can use, that's only half the battle. Learn how to explain the complex details behind your designs in a succinct way that non-electronics laymen can understand. If someone listening you asks a question or challenges your design implementations, you have to know how to respond in a way that defends your choices of how you designed your electronics without coming off as overly aggressive or desperate.  ... I'll leave it at that before I drone on and on.  Good luck in your new electronics goals! You've made a rewarding decision to pursue it!"

I don't understand why people get so excited about cheap undocumented chips from China. Is your time worth nothing to you? I think now maybe the ESP8266 has sufficient documentation from 3rd parties, but before then, why waste your time? If someone is using an Arduino I don't think minimizing BOM cost per unit is on the top of the list."
electronics,35uy8y,noiserr,7,Wed May 13 21:25:13 2015 UTC,"That's exactly why the ESP8266 is exciting. Thanks to the Arduino/esp8266 project, you can program this guy with the Arduino IDE. Most Arduino functions and libraries work out of the box with little to no fiddling.  What you're saying was absolutely true a few months ago, but let me tell you, this chip is most definitely worth another look. Using one of these, you probably wont even need to use an attached microcontroller."

electronics,35uy8y,sej7278,1 point,Thu May 14 00:03:42 2015 UTC,"It took me a few days of spare time to get the Arduino IDE working including connecting to my WiFi network and controlling a shift register via SPI. This is without any other components (no AVR based Arduino), just bare esp8266.  Why do I waste the time with esp8266? Simple, it's orders of magnitude cheaper. TI CC3200 is $40 on mouser. I can get esp8266 for less than $4. Should I decide to include it in a product design I am working on that's a huge difference.   Personally I would much rather use an Arm based core, but Arduino ecosystem and IDE support (cross platform I use a Mac) and cheap modules for prototyping is a no brainer."
electronics,35uy8y,sej7278,1 point,Sat May 16 07:18:27 2015 UTC,"I get that the ESP8266 is cheaper. Still, I think you are exaggerating the cost of the CC3200. It's $7 in 1000x quantities, and the development board is $30 direct from TI. It is also an ARM core which mean you can use GCC and standard arm development tools to develop and debug on it."
electronics,35uy8y,wigguno,1 point,Sat May 16 21:29:05 2015 UTC,"Well I intend to make small runs of 20 or 50. Also I didn't make up the price. The chip alone is $15 on Mouser in 50pcs quantity http://www.mouser.com/Semiconductors/RF-Integrated-Circuits/_/N-3rhuo?Keyword=CC3200&FS=True  Having had experience getting the Eclipse to work with the ARM toolchains for STM32 chips. From first hand experience, Arduino ESP8266 is much easier to get going. Arduino sketches run on it with no modification for the most part. So really easy to prototype with.  There are complete IDE bundles for ARM but none of them are cross platform. Arduino is cross platform for one so I don't have to roll a Windows VM. Using Windows is just not the workflow I prefer. I am a software engineer by trade and I like my workflow.  Also 1000x quantity and it's still twice the cost? You could probably get sub $2 ESP8266 in that quantity, I was quoted $2.10 for 100. Not to mention Arduino ecosystem is much better, with great online resources, libs and tutorials for it.  Don't get me wrong I get that ARM or CC3200 are technologically superior MCU/SOCs. I still use STM32 for projects (also because it's cheap), but ESP8266 is a game changer. It may not be perfect, but it's cheap and easy to get into..   The high cost and the lack of community support is why CC3200 is dead in the water when it comes to maker community.  For one offs, ESP8266 wins because Arduino. Super fast to get a sketch going for what you'r working on.  For mass production, ESP8266 is much much cheaper. So I don't see a reason why I would ever consider CC3200 over ESP8266.   I just don't see why I would waste $5 per device I am making and have to spend $7000 upfront to get the priviledge for something that's harder to use. On a 1000 pieces that's $5k wasted, I would much rather spend that on a nice Oscilloscope or something, or put it towards a pick and place machine fund."
electronics,35uy8y,wigguno,1 point,Sat May 16 23:26:10 2015 UTC,this is pretty much the conclusion i'm coming to after fighting with esp's for a good few months. i'm fed up of the walled garden approach to development that espressif have - and ironically they seem to steel opensource code for their closed sdk.  to get a half decent number of pins you have to use boards with stupid pinouts and adaptors. they're incredibly power hungry and fussy about power supplies (no chance of 2xAA). you have to use crappy suppliers from aliexpress that either don't deliver at all or take 3 months to send you the wrong item. i'd really rather just buy a spark photon.

I have some useful tips which I have learnt the hard way. Hope these will help you out next time:  1) First of all, identify the spot where mcu will sit. Put the mcu there.  2) Clock is very important. It should be as near as possible. Put the crystal near the mcu. Also put the decoupling capacitors that go with the crystal.  3) Supply of the mcu is very important as well. Put a decoupling 0.1 uF right near the mcu between GND and VCC pins. Do it for all sensitive ICs on the board. It never harms your design.  4) Crystal should be buried between a nice ground plane. Place your components in a way to ensure that.  5) Now comes the GND plane itself. Try to make most of the traces on top side (even if you have through hole components). This will leave you a less broken bottom side which you can use to draw a nice GND plane. Use vias to cover up the top in GND as much as possible.  This way, you make a PCB ground up."

electronics,35tkh4,Kolde,3,Wed May 13 17:36:23 2015 UTC,"I actually use a water soluble flux which isn't resin based. Too many people don't know about it so imma write a blurb here.  It works much better than resin flux in terms of getting solder to flow and it spreads around like water instead of a goop, making it much easier to apply. And all it takes is a hot shower to get it off (which is fine for 99% of electronics, but beware of water getting trapped in speakers/sockets etc).   The only problem with it, and the reason a lot of people are afraid of it I suppose, is it's faaaar more corrosive than resin based solder, so you need to remove it within a day, and it's also electrically conducive, so if you don't remove it effectively your circuit will short. People are overly scared of it though. Been using it for years without problems in a manufacturing environment and it's just wonderful stuff.   There are lots of different types of flux, folks."

However, once you have a PCB with a dozen 603s on it, reflow soldering will save you a lot of time. This is especially true if you ever decide you want two of whichever board you populated."

electronics,35tkh4,rallick_nom,1 point,Wed May 13 22:09:53 2015 UTC,I have ordered a PCB which includes smd components. I was too scared to use 0603 or 0805. I selected 1206 components. However there is a TQFP 32 pin atmega328 IC. Your suggestions will help. Thanks a lot.
electronics,35tkh4,quorrall,6,Wed May 13 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Soldering surface mount 0603 and smaller parts is simpler than one night think. Place the part squarely on pads. Prime your soldering iron with a bit of solder on the end. Hold part down with tweezers but not too hard or it will fly into Never-never-land. Touch one end with soldering iron, make sure a nice little solder fillet is made then do other side. If no fillet is formed put a little more solder on the end of your iron and try again. And you're done, yey. I design boards then have to work on em, PM if you have any questions."
electronics,35tkh4,Kolde,3,Wed May 13 17:51:08 2015 UTC,"Apply a ton of flux to the pins, place the chip in its proper orientation, solder one corner pin (there's really no trick), solder the opposite solder pin, and then carefully solder the rest. It's okay if you make solder bridges, and you will. They can be cleaned up by applying more flux, if necessary, heating up the solder with your iron and, in a quick motion, ""pulling"" the solder off by dragging your iron across the pins (toward the pcb). The solder should either fly off the pins landing on the pcb or will briefly loosen from the IC pins getting attached instead to your iron, thereby removing the solder bridge. This is my general technique to get rid of almost ANY solder bridge.  Also 0603 and 0805 is much harder than 1206, but, once again, only with insufficient flux. People usually have horror stories because they didn't use enough flux, and then, because the pad was so small they couldn't transfer enough heat to the pad and nightmares ensued.   Flux flux and more flux."
electronics,35tkh4,coder543,1 point,Wed May 13 18:30:33 2015 UTC,"My main issue with soldering SMD ICs is that I tend to get solder behind the pins. I don't know how I do it, but I end up with a ball of solder behind and bridging two or three pins, both of the times that I've tried to solder TSSOP20 packaged micros. Admittedly, I didn't use any flux. The first time, I hand soldered it with lead free solder and an iron, a multihour experience in doing things the hard way just to know what it's like. The next time, I used solder paste and a heat gun. 5 minutes from zero to soldered, but I still ended up with the same, weird issue.  Do you really think flux would stop solder from getting behind the pins?"
electronics,35tkh4,Kolde,1 point,Wed May 13 18:52:39 2015 UTC,"No flux AND lead free solder? Yikes. There's your problem. Yes, I genuinely think your problem will be solved with flux.  Edit: The problem may also be that your solder was too thick, or that you applied too much solder paste. Get thin solder if you don't have it already. And by god get lead based solder unless you have to meet environmental requirements. Silver based solder is a nightmare.  Edit 2: The reason flux will fix this is that , with sufficient flux, the globs of solder forming behind the pins will flow out to the center of the pins where it's easily accessible and can be removed by the technique I described."

electronics,35tkh4,softwaredev,3,Wed May 13 14:45:16 2015 UTC,Soldering iron. They're really easy. A bit of liquid flux helps.
electronics,35tkh4,softwaredev,1 point,Wed May 13 19:07:30 2015 UTC,The best way IMO is an oven.
electronics,35tkh4,illjustcheckthis,1 point,Wed May 13 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"Depending on the technology you have avaliable. On my job i had a heat gun. The oven is also a good way to do it, if you have one."

I just have one other thing to add which is minimizing your dead copper regions (those voids on your board where there isn't any copper planes). I presume your plane is ground so I would just add some ground vias or something in those areas so your layout software will not get rid of all that pretty copper when doing the polygon pour.

Thank you very much."
electronics,35tkh4,jrmxrf,2,Wed May 13 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"servely lacking power decoupling       what do you mean with this?   IC power lines should have decoupling/bypass capacitors on them to take care of noise from the power source. Basically, a capacitor from the power line to ground. Most manufacturers will have a recommended configuration (often with circuit diagram) in the datasheets for their ICs.  If in doubt, a pair of 0.1uF and 1.0uF capacitors will probably do you fine."
electronics,35uslg,mpfjr,2,Wed May 13 18:10:05 2015 UTC,"I would recommend a 13V-15V switch-mode supply and a linear post-regulator. If you want a super low noise DIY-able regulator, look into the ""super regulators"" audio enthusiasts use.  Other high-current regulators would be Project 77 or Project 142 from esp.  A third alternative would be to just order any high-current LDO.  For power supplies, check out the chinese 12V supplies on ebay/Aliexpress. Most of them have a potentiometer that allows you to change the output voltage by a few volts. That would allow you to minimize the voltage drop (and power dissipated) across the regulator.  Also, filtering is your friend! A few capacitors in parallel (~one per two decades, i.e. a 100n, 10u, 1m) swallow some noise, and a series inductor as well. Be aware that many linear regulators don't like big capacitors at their output, so choose only one of the two.  Finally, be aware that noise can couple into your system through several paths. One of which are the supply lines from the PSU, but it can also be EM radiation or magnetic fields from the power supply which generate the noise. That depends on your device and its sensitivity."
electronics,35uslg,kegelwerfer,3,Wed May 13 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"If you are going to go the switching+linear route, be absolutely certain to read Jim Williams app note 101.  (hint: using a cap to filter switching noise is the wrong way to do it.)"

electronics,35uslg,kegelwerfer,1 point,Wed May 13 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"It sounds like what you need is proper isolation.  If you power the camera from a clean, isolated power source you can probably ignore noise elsewhere."

electronics,35ual2,render3,2,Wed May 13 15:53:06 2015 UTC,"I'm looking to do the exact same thing!!!! I haven't built anything yet, but I've settled on a design. I'm going to have a sealed container that's capable of maintaining a small bit of pressure. Then I'll use a differential pressure sensor to measure the difference to ambient. Then, when this reaches a threshold, pump out the gas inside the vessel with a peristaltic pump. These pumps have extremely reliable flow rates! I'll use an arduino to control and measure all this! This process means you don't need a sump or anything like that. Positive pressure inside the vessel will stop bacterial contamination. It seems to be the best way to operate. The only thing I haven't been able to solve is what to do if the fermentation is producing more gas than I can vent. Maybe an adjustable safety valve to vent gas, but then I loose data during the most important part of the brew.   It'd be great if you could do an update on what you actually end up doing! I'm going to build my own home brew setup in the coming months, so I'll have to solve this issue at some point! :)"

electronics,35rys6,xkarya,7,Wed May 13 00:38:35 2015 UTC,"a brief overview from the other thread:   the outer ring represents the terrestrial planets, where pink is mercury, gold is venus, blue is earth, and red is mars. when either venus, mercury, or mars share the same quadrant, the quadrant successively blinks their respective colors. when earth and one of the other planets share the same quadrant, it's solid white. it might be a little difficult to tell in the second picture (the LEDs are so bright they mess with the camera sensors), but mars is the topmost, mercury is to the left, and earth and venus are sharing the same quadrant so they are white. that image is NOT a live representation. it was just a test. the middle ring is a representation of current months in the calendar year. the center LED is just the sun. the RTC that makes it live is a ds1307, with an adafruit breakout board and a backup battery. this way you don't have to worry about reseting the time and date, even if you unplug it. for anyone wondering about the math that went into the coding, it uses an astronomical unit of time called JULIAN DAYS to calculate the positions of each planet. the coordinates I'm using are based on the mean longitude of each orbit. this means that it treats the planetary orbits as coplanar circles, instead of intersecting ellipses - just for the sake of simplification. it's surprisingly accurate! i've spent all day googling the dates of future and past transits of planets between the earth and the sun and confirming it visually with the device. hasn't been wrong yet."
electronics,35rys6,rth182,2,Wed May 13 00:39:46 2015 UTC,I've actually begin a project using the DS1307 myself.  I'm using it with a TI Launchpad for weather data logging.  Any tips or useful resources that I should know?

electronics,35u0ln,cagewithakay,5,Wed May 13 14:32:53 2015 UTC,"Learning electronics or technology at school is a joke. The classes will never be at a high enough level to get you on your feet. Most beginner classes start you off with theory, and if you don't know how to apply it, it's useless.  If the class has a practical application(like a lab, or hardware project) then it might be beneficial.  One thing you have to understand about technology at school is that once the curriculum is decided it's only ever really valid for a few years(depending on the topic). After that the technology available surpasses that which is taught in the curriculum and it must change to accomodate. A lot of school DO NOT change to accomodate.  Plus once you start working on your own projects it is all a self taught process anyways. There is no way a teacher can teach you everything your going to need for your future projects, and at some point your going to need to venture off into this world of part numbers and components on your own...  Your going to be a lot better off if you learn how to teach yourself now, because your going to be doing it for the rest of your life if you continue to pursue electronics. Thats just how it is, you can't change it...  I have been working as an embedded engineer at Large corporation for 5 years and there is no way school could have prepared me for what I'm doing. I started learning on my own since high school and have not stopped since. Needless to say all my college classes were all merely review.  My point is that to learn about electricity and electronics, the easiest way is to try it yourself.  Instead of spending the money on your classes, find a good tutorial or helpful link online and start your own project. Simple electronic projects are VERY cheap. There are a lot of websites that walk you through the process of creating all kinds of electronic projects of varying difficulty.  Maybe start by trying to create your own electric guitar? And then move onto creating an amplifier for your guitar. Then eventually some effects pedals. This is all AC circuitry and can be done with a basic understanding of AC waves...  If you plan on pursuing a career in electronics then by all means take the courses and snag that degree. But if it's going to be for a hobby then I say just do it yourself. No need to spend all that money just for some knowledge you can find on your own."

electronics,35vas2,octavio2895,1 point,Wed May 13 20:27:40 2015 UTC,"The problem with stringing the strips end-to-end is that the large currents will cause voltage drops through the conductors, to the extent that the farthest LEDs will get dim.  A solution is to connect additional wires in parallel to the internal conductors in the strips. Kind of brute-force, but it works, if you get the right amount of copper.  You can try to calculate what size of wires you need, but I have found those strips to have a wide range of currents, so you can just lay them out somewhere and try it. Get a roll of #12 wire, and start adding parallel lines. Do a visual on the LEDs, or measure the voltages at both ends."
electronics,35vas2,1wiseguy,1 point,Wed May 13 20:57:45 2015 UTC,"The problem with running extra parallel conductors with RGB strips is that if the conductor breaks, all the current tries to go in the strip. Resistance might limit it to a safe level or might not. The easy solution is to only ever power a strip at one end, dividing the big strip into smaller sub strips that branch out from one conductor. Then all the strips are effectively parallel and you don't get the risk of a failed wire putting massive current through your led strip."

electronics,35vas2,EternityForest,1 point,Thu May 14 00:07:27 2015 UTC,"Some RGB amplifiers are opto isolated and will not pass any fault current between input and output IIRC. Ones that aren't might have high impedance inputs allowing you to put 47k resistors or something between the end of one strip and the input that could block any current flow.  With those it would be safe to use an amp between the strings (Because only one end is connected to the power rails) and only need to run power and ground.  I'd imagine they mostly are isolated though, but can't be sure(except the arduino forum claims one specific one for sure is, and I've used one that I'm pretty sure is, but it was meant for ttl input only)  More info: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=229336.0"

electronics,35tof7,cloidnerux,2,Wed May 13 13:16:56 2015 UTC,"mosfets are great for DC loads, especially motors and high power LEDs"
electronics,35tof7,chrwei,2,Wed May 13 14:25:00 2015 UTC,What you are looking for is non existant.  If you have a specific application there will be something.  You wan't to dimm a lamp? There are phase-cut-dimmers.  You wan't to control a motor? Either a VFD/Inverter for AC motors or a PWM type half/full-bridge. or more in general: motor driver.  Wan't to dimm a heater? PWM and a MOSFET.
electronics,35tof7,jaywastaken,1 point,Wed May 13 13:51:24 2015 UTC,"depends on what you mean by ""power output"".  you can PWM a mosfet for many things. there are also household light dimmers with 0-10V dimmer controls that are easy to interface.  for some AC things you'd need a variac."

But when you get them you realize that Pin 3 is actually supposed to be connected to Pin 2 not Pin 4!!!!

electronics,35o13m,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Tue May 12 04:57:26 2015 UTC,"I suppose adding an external crystal oscillator would help, but I don't think it would last more than a day, based on my experiments with dev boards. The next step up is high quality RTCs, but that'd blow my budget all to hell. The easiest thing to do would be to just slow the date of color change, so that the drift isn't as noticeable. I'm not sure if the necklaces would still be ""interesting"", if you couldn't see them changing."
electronics,35o13m,FullFrontalNoodly,9,Tue May 12 05:08:35 2015 UTC,"C'mon now! Everything that's worth doing is worth overdoing.  What you need is a Microsemi QuantumTM SA.45s Chip Scale Atomic Clock. Why deal with crystals when you can use just use the hyperfine transition of electrons in Rubidum-87 atoms as a frequency reference? At only $1500 bucks a pop, it's a steal of a deal.  Okay, more realistically, you can buy a TCXO (temperature compensated crystal oscillator). These come in varying stabilities. A design for a communications system I'm working on uses a 280 ppb stability telecom reference which costs about $30, but that's overkill for your application. You should be able to pick up a 10 ppm or better stability reference on DigiKey for less than $4, though, and that'll be a hell of a lot better than a straight crystal."
electronics,35o13m,freyyr,8,Tue May 12 05:25:21 2015 UTC,Why bother with that when you can get an ESP8266 and sync time over the network?  They are only $3 these days and can replace your existing MCU.

electronics,35o13m,A1cypher,3,Tue May 12 05:56:49 2015 UTC,And? It's only a matter of practise (and good flux - a lot of it). You can rework even large QFNs by hand soldering.
electronics,35o13m,alez,3,Tue May 12 08:07:54 2015 UTC,"DFN isn't hard. Make the pads a bit longer so they stick out past the package, put your soldering iron on to the pad and it will conduct the heat under the DFN part.  Use liquid flux, and tin one pad first.  Place the part, apply heat to tinned pad, and push gently down on the part. When it reflows, the part will shift down slightly and this is your last chance to make sure it's aligned.  Solder the rest of the pads by wicking the solder under the part.  Apply more liquid flux if necessary."
electronics,35o13m,anonworkacct,2,Tue May 12 09:35:10 2015 UTC,Right. I often forget not everyone has access to a reflow oven.
electronics,35o13m,TomAskew,2,Tue May 12 06:11:50 2015 UTC,"If my calc's are correct, and they probably aren't. An 8mhz crystal with 20ppm drift would give you ~7hrs until it drifted 1s, with maximum error, as in one crystal at -20ppm and the other at +20ppm. Crystal osc is pretty cheap and only adds 3 components, don't know how many pins you have spare though for the attiny."
electronics,35o13m,TomAskew,1 point,Tue May 12 11:24:18 2015 UTC,"That's what I would think too, crystals are crazy accurate in my experience. Otherwise, adding a real time clock could be an option, but that seems overkill to me."
electronics,35o13m,TomAskew,1 point,Tue May 12 22:36:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the RTC would also be only as accurate as the crystal driving it, so likely would be overkill that might not even fix the problem.  What I would suggest is to change the code so that it updates the RNG every second instead of every however many milliseconds you are currently doing it.   This way, if you drift 1 second in 7 hours the shift in colour will only be slight and the two pendants should remain pretty close for a day or so even.     You could even sell this drift as a feature by saying something like the longer you are apart from each other the less in synch your emotions are, blah blah, sappy stuff.  This would then encourage the two people in a relationship to ""re-sync"" as much as possible, thus improving their relationship."
electronics,35o13m,krets,1 point,Thu May 14 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"If you had a way to actually communicate between them (maybe just at programming time) a simple crystal can go a long way.  Here is how I would do it: The master trinket puts out a clock that is received by the slave trinket.  The slave trinket adjusts its timer to count as fast as the master.  This would probably require some mucking about with AVR C and maybe even a spot or two of AVR assembler, since if you want to maximize precision you have to take the time it takes for each individual CPU instruction into account.  If you decide against the crystals you can also calibrate the internal oscillators, that is even easier because you can tune them in hardware and don't have to change much in the software. I would even argue that you have to do it if you want them to reliably stay in sync for at least a few minutes (the internal oscillator tolerance is +-10% when uncalibrated)  EDIT: Technically you don't even have to use another trinket as the calibration source, just use the same source for both devices."

As to whether or not you could design and build one yourself: The ODAC schematic is available, but the main ICs are tricky to get.

But if it is a capacitor used for timing, like for a 555 IC, then you must use a 10 uF to achieve the intended distortion effect that was conceived by the author of the schematic that you are using.

After digging out my magnifying glass, it looks like that capacitor may be part of a tone control circuit.  Substituting a different value may significantly alter the tone response, possibly causing the circuit to not do what you want.  Also, since it's in series with an audio pathway, it must be a NP (non-polarized) type capacitor.  If it's simply acting as a DC blocking capacitor and that knob is for volume, then a 100uF NP will work fine. You'll just get a louder pop when you connect the battery  If you don't have NP type capacitors, you can hook two ordinary capacitors in anti-series to make one. It will have half the capacitance, ie 2x 100uF will make a 50uF NP."

electronics,35kzqe,jms_nh,1 point,Mon May 11 22:40:45 2015 UTC,I believe the real question here is whether the people with the knowledge of how to build and operate the factories will show allegiance to China or to other countries.

electronics,35kzqe,jms_nh,2,Mon May 11 22:57:36 2015 UTC,"The operating stability is really going to be a question of how well the Chinese government manages to ""persuade"" the majority of the population that being ""proper China"" isn't a bad thing.

electronics,35otq3,schnoper,0,Sat May 16 03:42:35 2015 UTC,"Electric motors are mostly limited by their ability to dissipate heat.  Since the windings are not super conductors, the more current you push through them the more heat they make.  But hey, for short periods of time you can run a quite a lot of current through them before they get too hot.  Which means there are three other things which may limit the power of an electric motor over short periods of time.  1) Mechanical strength. Yep, that's right if the forces get too high they'll self destruct mechanically.  2) For permanent magnet motors, there is a limited field strength ( hence torque ) provided by the permanent magnets. Once the windings hit that field strength, more current doesn't provide more torque.  3) In order to push current, the voltages need to climb, and the windings and/or brushes might not be able to handle the voltages involved.  Ok, all that said,  if you a running a motor for less than 40 seconds, you can run it MUCH harder than you would be able to run in under continuous conditions.   SO what does that mean for practical purposes.  Since you've already implied you are using a motor to lift the 0.5 kg weight, I would just use that same type of motor to move car+weight.  You might have to drive it beyond it's ""rated"" specs, just let it cool off so that the average power dissipation is what it's rated for.   So for example. if the motor says it can run on 1amp continuously off of 12 V.  let's say you kick that to 24V.  The motor will turn twice as fast and probably draw roughly twice as much current.  And pull 4 times the power.  So if you run that for 30 seconds, you need to let it cool for at least 1.5 minutes after.  If you have access to a thermometer, monitoring the temp is a good idea."

Seems like a slight risk to the PSU/motherboard in case that external connector shorts with something, just to save a wall wart.  I guess I did something in the same general arena as this, putting a three-way Y connector on a 12V 2A external power brick, so it could power my VoIP router, WiFi router, and cable modem. They run all the time so my goal was to make it a little more efficient than three 12V 1A supplies (all switching, so maybe the it makes little difference)."

electronics,35lk7w,vzq,2,Mon May 11 17:04:05 2015 UTC,"To explain a little further, most PCB shops have only a limited number of drill sizes and what you specify in your gerber is only a ""hint"" as for which one to use."
electronics,35lk7w,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Mon May 11 22:06:02 2015 UTC,"Without a data sheet for the probe, it's hard to give a definitive answer. If it is designed to be press-fit, the information for the required hole size should be on it. Press-fit pins have a section designed to be deformed when inserted creating a gas-tight fit, and it takes a fair amount of insertion force. Unless it's designed to be press-fit, it's going to be hard to achieve what you're trying.  Most plated holes on a PCB have a 6 mil tolerance in diameter, because first they're drilled, then copper plated, then finish plated to the final size. A lot of room for variations. And finished hole sizes are usually 10-20 mils larger than the lead, so it's easy to put the lead in the hole with automated equipment, but not too large to let a cold solder joint happen because too much solder is needed to fill the gap.  So if your part doesn't have a squishable section, then you need to make the minimum hole size larger than its maximum diameter, other wise it won't even fit. You're going to be hand assembling these, so the range of hole size can be small, say plus just a couple of mils, but that depends on the limits and accuracy of whoever is fabbing it. And even then, you can't reasonably expect the part to stay in the hole without any soldering at all. If there's a step in the lead that allows it to rest on top of the hole, then you need a pad just a little larger than that step, and you can use that area to tack the part in place with just a little solder. It won't be terribly strong, but it might work for your purposes."

electronics,35j84x,Robotic_Llama,3,Sun May 10 22:18:47 2015 UTC,"Things I would check   Ground connection between the programmer and device. MOSI/MISO if you're using proto-wires to a breadboard. IDC ribbon cable from programmer can break after a while - continuity test while moving the bundle around.   Last obvious thing is to check all the signal lines, MOSI, MISO, SCK, RESET. Having a scope helps a lot but is not critical. Since all the programmer is concerned about is a voltage on its Vcc pin to start doing its thing, you could leave all the other lines open and it will still try program. Try passing the clock and data lines through a speaker or relay to verify audibly that stuff is happening. Don't forget to include a freewheeling diode to take care of the collapsing fields or you may blow your (perhaps working) programmer.  If you see/hear stuff happening on the scope/speaker/relay, the programmer is most likely working. If not, and you're absolutely certain you checked the first three things correctly, it's probably toast. Otherwise, continue...   Check baud rate (I'm assuming you're using avrdude) Check the device identifier (t25 for attiny25) I'm assuming port is working since you're getting diagnostic feedback.   Things to check on the device:   Clock. Crucial unless you're doing HVPP (you're not). You actually do need a scope to verify this. 10x probe. Reset line (pull-up through 10k to Vcc). Check nothing else is battling for MOSI/MISO/SCK. No need to pull these up, SPI is push-pull.   Repeat all of this for other devices you're trying with. Preferably verify with fresh chips as well to ensure the fuses haven't been molested. If it still fails, I guess the programmer really is shot."

I don't think this happened because I'm usually pretty careful not to do that but its possible.  I will try those things and see if I can get it working though.    Edit:  I just hooked up the oscilloscope, when I try to program the chip, I get a signal on all the data lines except for mosi.

Add the tiny market, and it is expensive. The parts cost of a shield with the above is probably $15 alone, unless one was making a bunch.  If it doesn't interface to anything (temperature sensor, or camera, say), or has isolated inputs (optocouplers or so), then you don't need isolation as such and it gets a lot cheaper. Something like TPS2375 + buck converter of your choice (though note, the amount of buck ICs that can handle 60V input is pretty limited, probably less than 5% of them, so you have to hunt a bit).  I've made both, the buck ones are a lot simpler. The flyback ones I wanted multiple rails (one at 200V) on a dinky transformer, so I had some trouble winding it and tweaking it. PITA. (it was a nixie clock, so it had 200V and 5V rails).  You could hack something up with one of these or similar, but you still need the RJ45 jack, and you still need a enc28j60 or wiz chip to interface to the arduino - this is only power.

Deal with it ;)  For those curious, this subjected a 10V rated tantalum to a 20V 1A current limited ""transient"".  It instapopped of course.   It wasn't even 1uF but that isn't rally what matters.  Tantalum capacitors are constructed using sintered tantalum covered with manganese dioxide as the dielectric electrolyte and cathode. This causes tantalum pentoxide to form at the interface of the two as the dielectric, but should that interface ever be depolarized, or destroyed by an arc-over, it will not reform like the oxide layer in aluminum electrolytic capacitors.  Once you bust a hole in the dielectric, or worse, depolarize it (which amounts to the same thing), you've permanently turned your tantalum capacitor into a short with an ohm or two of resistance.  Yep, the perfect sweet spot to shit watts of heat potentially without triggering other fault protection in the circuit.    And getting hot is bad for tantalum capacitors.  Tantalum and manganese dioxide can undergo a reaction similar to aluminum and iron oxide, better known as thermite.  The ignition temperature is much lower, as well as the actual temperature of the burn, but it's more than enough to ruin your day or more.    EDIT: manganese dioxide is the electrolyte (and cathode), not the dielectric.

Even big electrolytics vent, but they rarely ignite, if ever.  Tantalum failure = potential to cause serious damage or start a fire.    So its actually about why we derate tantalum capacitors =P."

I don't think it's an appropriate component selection for environments where there could be a flammable gas mixture, etc.  Then again, a lot of components are inappropriate in those situations, depending if there is sufficient current limiting in place to keep a shorted component from blowing up."

There are definitely other things that can fail in  destructive ways, but at the risk of seeming like a bit of a fear monger, I do think its worth seeing how failures can play out every now and then.  At least for me, it's all too easy to get too complacent when failures are mostly a statistic, a MTFB or service hours graph in a datasheet, etc.  I knew of the tantalum capacitor's reputation, but I wanted to see just how bad could it really be? Surely the derating guidelines are being overly cautious?   I see their point now heh."

They limit the leakage current chemically, and once the transient/fault is removed, they will self-heal their dielectric and return to normal with no measurable change in their ESR or leakage.  I'll find the paper backing this up in a bit, getting busy atm.

There is really no reason to use them in a design unless its High-rel or milspec though, IMO.  Too expensive for too little benefit.  They definitely still make 'em though, there are quite a variety on mouser.com.  And good lord, are they expensive.  https://metacollin.com/screens/upshot_nsj19bqX.png  Note, you can see a purple lead coming out of one of them, then welded to a regular-looking lead.  Lack of this doesn't mean anything, but presence of it is a sure sign it's a wet tantalum.  The purple color is because that lead is pure tantalum wire, and the purple is an oxide layer.

electronics,35cit9,jrblast,32,Sat May 9 00:10:08 2015 UTC,This is VERY common among Chinese LED bulbs. It's only dangerous if the capacitor isn't rated for the voltage. It's a simple capacitive dropper.

It's incredibly efficient.  Also, if there's no bleed resistor, you'll zap your fingers on it if you remove it and touch the terminals (depending at which point in the AC cycle it became disconnected).  The reason it's not done on other electronics is that it provides no isolation.  The load circuitry is live with respect to the AC neutral/ground."

electronics,35cit9,bradn,3,Sat May 9 02:33:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. The film cap basically shoves the input current out of phase with the voltage, limiting draw without burning off a lot of real, in-phase power, like with a resistor."
electronics,35cit9,DoctorLondom,5,Sat May 9 13:44:51 2015 UTC,Yup. The polyester cap there would be in series with the mains and sometimes they tack on an electrolytic on the output to prevent the light from flickering.
electronics,35cit9,bradn,3,Sat May 9 02:23:05 2015 UTC,Also having the electrolytic on there prevents (or at least reduces) a large current spike from going through the LEDs when power is first connected.  One of the two resistors might also be to limit inrush current for that case.

Isolation is not required for a self contained lamp like this but regulation would extend the life of the LEDs. Cheap lamps also tend to slightly overdrive the LEDs which greatly cuts lifespan and tends to introduce a blue cast to the light.   What concerns me is the apparent lack of fusing....  If the cap shorts, not only will the lamp be toast, the electrolytic cap and diodes (rectifier and LEDs) will likely fail shorted with nothing but the primary overcurrent protection device in between the failed lamp and the mains. Since the primary overcurrent protection is a fuse or breaker serving the circuit the lamp socket is on, this could present a significant risk of fire. I don't think that thing will retain its magic smoke if 10-20A flows through it!

electronics,35cit9,gxti,7,Sat May 9 04:51:23 2015 UTC,"Line voltage variation is a minor concern but for high power LEDs, the fact that LED voltage drop varies with temp can cause some real issues with dissipation when maximum output is required.   You have two choices: Intentionally run the LEDs at lower intensity to compensate for the diode characteristics with temp or you can accept lower life as temperatures rise. (The latter also means you will accept color temperature drift as well, possibly lasting color dirft due to phosphor degredation if temps get too high.)  The Cree LED array in their 65W floodlight starts at 240VDC and goes down to 220-215V as the LED warms up thanks to a constant current regulator. It runs cool, it's color temp is rock steady and so is the brightness. It's a pretty nice circuit inside there and a really sweet bit of engineering.

electronics,35cit9,inwats,1 point,Sat May 9 22:01:13 2015 UTC,"I've been informed that they sometimes do and for possibly two reasons.  1: Depending on the design of the lamp if the design is such that the filament can fail in such a manner that it could effectively still be an intact circuit if the filament breaks. (More likely for certain filament geometries, impossible to unlikely on others)  You may have seen a lamp with a broken filament that not only still burned but burned much brighter than usual. That is scenario 1 in action. For some types, this condition is hazardous.  2: If the filament is sufficiently durable that it might not melt under prolonged over voltage conditions that would normally cause an ordinary filament to fail quickly.  In either case, the goal is to prevent excessive envelope temperature and to suppress arcing, both of which could compromise the envelope. (on pressurized types, this can cause violent shattering of the lamp envelope)  The fuse will either be an intentionally thin spot near the end of the filament or it will be in the leads in the stem that supports the filament.   In any case, an incandescent lamp's components are in an oxygen free environment and not in direct contact with potentially combustible materials...unlike those SMD resistors.

electronics,35dea0,Welcome_To_Bangkok,3,Sat May 9 06:04:16 2015 UTC,Fairly certain it's a term used in signal processing. A receiver classed as coherent knows the nature of the signals or 'symbols' it's searching for. This makes them especially robust to transmission noise as they can apply some nifty filtering techniques to separate useful information from junk.
electronics,35dea0,ayilm1,1 point,Sat May 9 08:01:28 2015 UTC,In a coherent circuit the output waveform is a linear function of the input with respect to phase and frequency.  Non-coherent systems then are non-linear in one or both.  A good signal processing text should cover it.  Unfortunately I don't have one I can recommend right now.
electronics,35dea0,TrainsareFascinating,1 point,Sat May 9 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"In digital communication systems, coherent systems have accurate phase estimation and thus the I and Q components can be separated from the passband signal for symbol detection. In the case of a noncoherent system, there is not a good phase estimate available and the system can not separate the I and Q components, instead it looks at the magnitude which obviously results in reduced performance. For channels that have slowly time varying phase ( constant over 2 symbol intervals) information can be encoded in the phase transitions, this is known as differential encoding."
electronics,35dea0,Earlish,1 point,Sat May 9 15:36:40 2015 UTC,A coherent demodulator requires the carrier and the local oscillator to be in phase with each other to demodulate the original message. This would require the use of a phase lock loop PLL circuit.   An example of a non coherent demodulator would be an AM envelope detector.

electronics,356m82,MAD_JIHAD,7,Thu May 7 16:49:18 2015 UTC,The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from.
electronics,356m82,drcross,4,Thu May 7 18:42:06 2015 UTC,"In fairness USB-C has definite improvements over micro (power supply and reversibility) which had improvements over mini (number of insertions). The EU mandated at that all chargers had to be USB which moved all of the manufacturers to change, which is good. It looks like USB-C might be the charger that consolidates them all, Apple was able to skirt the law because it argued that lightening bolt had benefits over USB but since the new macbook has moved to USB-C only apple will probably follow suit on their phone line meaning all products in the EU will have USB-C chargers.  USB-C with up to 100w delivery could potentially redefine home wiring if home power storage like Tesla kicks off. Houses may be wired with USB wall plates for direct DC power bypassing the AC efficiency losses."

electronics,356m82,gsuberland,11,Fri May 8 05:03:12 2015 UTC,"The ISO is great in theory but in reality it is too easy for commercial interests to poison the standards development process.  For example, Microsoft fast-tracking their Office Open XML standard (OOXML) which was neither open nor (proper) XML and Microsoft's own tools (Word, Excel, etc) couldn't read documents built to the standard.  Actually, no one can read the entire ""standard"" because it refers to other documents which are not publicly available!  Yet there it is, signed-off by the ISO as an ""international standard.""  I'll never trust another ISO standard ever again and I will always avoid them if possible.  Thanks Microsoft!"

electronics,356m82,who8877,2,Fri May 8 04:21:52 2015 UTC,"This was indeed a problem back in the day but fortunately the open source development process officially resolved it back in 2011 when they released version 1.2 of the standard:  http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/OpenDocument-v1.2-part2.html  So it's not so much ""Pot meet kettle"" as it is ""Pot meet oven; something is cooking."""
electronics,356m82,riskable,1 point,Fri May 8 07:11:52 2015 UTC,I think you are mixing open source with the standardization process which is completely separate.  OpenXML has also undergone revisions since then as well.
electronics,356m82,I_am_Bob,2,Fri May 8 19:28:12 2015 UTC,"Ahh but the difference is that the ODF standard actually has a real-world open source reference implementation that works whereas there exists no implementation anywhere. Not even the latest Microsoft Office can open, save, and read perfectly-conformant OOXML documents!  Heck, using OOXML documents created in one version of MS Office are not guaranteed to work with other versions of MS Office!  There's no argument. OOXML is shit. It's so much shit, in fact, that even its creator (Microsoft) can't implement it properly. It is nothing but poison."

But a lot of countries have agencies that 'need' to check your reports and make you apply their label.. at a 'small' fee of course.   Also, the US and Canada are long time hold outs on adopting IEC standards meaning you still need to get certified to at least 3 sets of standards (IEC, UL, and CSA) to even come close to a true international product.   And so far CD scheme really only covers low voltage consumer electronics.

electronics,35acbe,mercfh85,3,Fri May 8 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"I was in the same boat, basically I wanted to PCB a lot of my projects and decided to make schematics first.  What really helped me was using Fritzing since it has breadboard, schematic, and PCB views.  I would replicate the project in the breadboard which gave ratnest guides on the other views.  Now that I have had some practice it is much easier for me to do a standalone schematic."
electronics,35acbe,nomuthetart,1 point,Fri May 8 15:51:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah like I can typically do stuff on breadboard, but component placement if I actually want to put it on a proto board...im unsure of."
electronics,35acbe,squirrelpotpie,2,Fri May 8 16:04:55 2015 UTC,"Do it on a breadboard first.  Get it so that the components with the most connections between them are the ones that are closest together.  Usually you'll end up with ""functional sections"" that go together, like the area you used to generate PWM and an area you used for some logic that uses certain inputs, or whatever.  When I'm designing, I start with these ""functional sections"" very spread out so that they can grow if I find I need more components, and each one has long wires to the others.  Once you have it working, you can look at the breadboard to see how large a space you need for each section.  Lay the functional sections out on the perfboard / protoboard / whatever so the sections with the most long wires between them are close together.  I use protoboard with the same connected rows as breadboards have, so I do this by counting rows.  If you have a hard time keeping track of it in your head, scan your protoboard and draw on top of it.  Remember you don't have to achieve 100% density.  Many components extend more than halfway into the next row, and can't be placed for perfect 100% row utilization.  Finding this out once the parts around them have already been soldered down really sucks, so leave yourself some room.  If you needed it small, you shouldn't have used perfboard.  You can always cut the perfboard to the size of your circuit once it's built.  Use a hacksaw.  Don't do this before your circuit is built, or if you forgot something you'll have a really bad time."
electronics,35acbe,Fencepost,7,Fri May 8 20:18:45 2015 UTC,"Learning circuit synthesis is not easy. It really comes from years of experience. You need to take classes on circuit analysis before you can do synthesis. Then you start to see things in stages - when you inherently ""get"" thevenin equivalents, then you'll be able to start."
electronics,35acbe,freezway,3,Fri May 8 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"You need to take classes on circuit analysis before you can do synthesis. Then you start to see things in stages - when you inherently ""get"" thevenin equivalents, then you'll be able to start.   I disagree. Yes it's hard but its something you can totally do without classes. Thevenin equivalents are handy, but I wouldn't say critical. EE classes are boring (at least at the beginning) and will discourage beginners. If you want to keep interest, start off running with something more interesting."

From a quick search the SOC they are using goes for $5 when you order like 1 million...  That leaves $4 at best for all the connectors (which there are a few: 2 USB, video, 2 GPIOs), board and components.  But the postage is $20 so maybe they are making their money back there.

electronics,356t3d,furyfairy,6,Thu May 7 17:33:23 2015 UTC,With having to add the $15 HDMI board if you want clean video it leaves you at the price of a basic Pi without all the connection ports or support. It's a neat idea but I don't know if it could compete with what's out there already.  They probably are making money via shipping because a small USPS flat rate box is like $7.
electronics,356t3d,Dave9876,3,Thu May 7 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"So, $9 + $15 for video + $20 for shipping.

Yet at the time, most of us were programming in assembler or even machine language, and Tiny Basics were just beginning to emerge. A small team, of which I was leader, developed a complete operating system, 32 bit integer math package, data library, analog interface, display, communication, and operating software in 32K EPROM plus 8K RAM.   This was an embedded computer that was used for taking multiple chemical sensor measurements and performing pattern analysis on them. The original assembler software took about 4 person-years to write and test.   The final prototype was written in C (1 person-year) and ran on a newer third party embedded computer, only now it was more like 128K in size. A version written to run on a PC was a suite totalling 5M or so (a couple of person-months), although it had no more capability then the 32K original version.   The point is, a modern program no longer even tries to conserve memory; memory is far cheaper than software. I've written programs that left megabytes of useless code just sitting in the body of the code in case it might be needed later. Who cares if a program is a meg or 20 meg in size anymore?"

This is the first thing we've tried to bring into a world market (everything prior has been local, but you can see what we make on our web-store http://www.moarobotics.com/products/) and if you have something that is keeping you from wanting to pledge, let us know! We can't improve and make our platform better unless we know what the issues are. Thanks!"
electronics,358fqi,furyfairy,2,Thu May 7 23:46:52 2015 UTC,"Can you share more details about the embedded software API, and especially how does it deal with complex stuff like concurrency, reentrancy, and non-blocking , while keeping everything simple ?"
electronics,358fqi,furyfairy,2,Fri May 8 12:35:03 2015 UTC,"Wow this is a nice technical question! When we were writing the API we actually thought a lot about this, the PIC is a single threaded platform by nature, but it's possible to implement a sort of pseudo-multithreading on the architecture very easily. We actually implement a very simple block multithreading model. On the PIC18F hardware we actually have 2 interrupt priority levels, so you can almost think of it as being 3 threads.    The thread 0 is the main loop being clocked from the 48MHz system clock. Thread 1 runs is the low priority interrupt and it runs at 10Hz. A human normally responds to stimuli within 200-250mS, so we wanted an update speed that was similar, as our CEO does a lot of research into AI and autonomous navigation. Thread 2 is the high priority interrupt and runs at 1000Hz. It simply updates a counter we use to track the passage of time (in mS).    Thread 0 - User Thread Thread 1 - Sensor Thread Thread 2 - Clocking Thread    The ReadRam and WriteRam commands are the only commands that completely block the execution of the platform , simply because it hogs the I2C bus and we don't want to be writing spurious data. When other commands that need to block execution are issued, they block execution of the user code only. e.g. Move will only block when a distance or delay is given otherwise it returns immediately, and Turn will block until it turns the given angle. When a block occurs thread control is passed to Thread 1, so that the sensor data can be continuously monitored until the set time, distance, or angle has been reached.  The clocking thread doesn't affect code execution in any way, so doesn't block anything.  So lets take the following code for run through!:  if(GetDist(0) > 200) // If we get a value > 200 (about 3"") from proximity sensor 0       Turn(15, 100, 0); // Turn 15 degrees at 100% full speed, with no wheel bias (turn in place)   else       Move(50, 50); // Move forward at 50% full speed     First GetDist(0), which simply returns the value read from the sensor during the last sensor update  Turn(15, 100, 0) will block, but during that time the sensors thread is still running, so once the robot detects is has turned >= 15 degrees it will stop and return.  Move(50, 50) will return immediately however because it doesn't have a delay or distance specified.  The user code then loops until the robot is turned of our an EndProg() command is issued which would halt execution of the platform. The code above results in a robot that drives forward at 50% speed until something is within 3"" of proximity sensor 0 and then rotate until it is out of sight before proceeding (ignoring blind spots in the sensor view).    The following code was actually written by our CEOs 8 year old daughter Sabrina, IR Line Following Demo by Sabrina S., who discovered you can follow lines using nothing but the proximity sensors.    I hope this answers your questions! Let me know if I missed anything or if you have any questions. There are plenty of little tricks to using the API to get around what might seem like a limitation, so if I can expand on any you might see, let me know!  TLDR;    Concurrency - We use a simple block multithreading model where the user thread passes control to the sensor thread.  Reentrancy - The PIC hardware stack is designed with two priority interrupts that perform context saving by default, so reentrancy was automatic.  Non-blocking - Sensor updates are never blocked, and user code is only blocked when you'd be waiting for something to finish anyway.  EDITED for formatting issues"
electronics,358fqi,mogski,1 point,Fri May 8 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"Very well though out , and looks very simple at the user level. Nice work!   What about the sensor layer - is every API written down ? or it's possible by people to develop code here, and how simple is it ?"
electronics,358fqi,TotesMessenger,2,Fri May 8 17:53:47 2015 UTC,"All the sensors are abstracted into the API, but the API will be open-source along with the entire platform, so it'll be possible to load up the API source (which is written in MPLab as well), add your own code, hit compile and have it integrated into the API!    It's possible to develop your own hardware and the code to go along with it, and it'll work along-side our API just fine. It's the same process that is used for our series of add-ons for Muribot; here's an example, you've purchased one of our CMUCam add-ons, after attaching it to the Muribot. You could install the library on your computer, open up your project, go into your source file and at the top you would add:    #include <Muribot/CMUCam.h>     Then for color tracking, you would simple call TrackColor(255, 255, 255) to track white for example, and then GetTrackedX() and GetTrackedY() to find the offset of that centroid of that color. You could then use that offset to control the motors to have the Muribot follow the tracked object.    Another example, you've bought Muribot. But you want an ARM processor instead of a PIC. You could completely ditch the API, and program the robot with our I2C slave firmware to accept motor commands through the I2C bus. Since all the sensors except the IMU (which is analog) are on the I2C channel, any processor which has I2C capability can take complete control of the platform, even the Raspberry PI! Add OpenCV, a cheap USB camera and you have a Muribot with really powerful vision capabilities!    We've really tried to make it easy to make your Muribot unique and make it hacker friendly, so we really hope to see some interesting add-ons. Hope this answers everything!"

I even implemented a spectrum analyzer application and I've got a network analyzer app that I'm in the process of writing up.  Are you sending data back to the PC via FTDI? If so, what effective bandwidth (nyquist of the scope) have you actually been able to achieve in practice?  Edit: I wish I had thought to promote it on here last year, but hey, I got to launch it at Maker Faire, so that was fun."
electronics,353ion,wespo,1 point,Wed May 6 20:51:36 2015 UTC,"Wow, that's awesome! We never thought of making an Arduino shield, but I like the display right on there.  It's funny you mention a spectrum analyzer, we actually use an old HP35665A for our research (mechanical impedance testing), and it's a huge pain. So we've realized we can implement one on nScope with higher-bandwidth and a direct interface to python.  A true lifesaver, considering the old HP has a floppy drive...  We are sending data via generic HID protocol. We used to do FTDI, but switched to HID about 2 years ago. We can achieve streaming rates of 36ks/s, but if you don't need a whole lot of points in a row, then you can sample at 4Ms/s.  Luckily, you don't usually need too many contiguous points at those high speeds."

During my high school years, once I  had gotten the hang of how things worked with software, I saw a Raspberry Pi on Hack A Day. It claimed that it could run Minecraft on it and was a building block for learning to program.  I saved up my money and eventually bought one. I started to learn the input and output pins and began programming on it so that I can learn to blink an LED.

I will say they are very nice tweezers.  I like the feel of the ESD coating in my hand and they seem to have the right weight/balance.  I would say that my tweezers are my 'go to' tool.  I probably have them in my hand about 90% of the time when I am constructing boards.  So, I might be confused about what you want in the syringe.  In the past, I have used Kester and ChipQuik solder pastes.  I used the Kester stuff on couple BGA parts for which I had stencils.  I was able to smear some pasted onto the stencil and then 'squeegee' the paste into the holes, place the part and then cook the board with an IR lamp that I own.  I don't actually recommend this approach but I have gotten it to work in the past.  I have used the the ChipQuik solder paste to attach some SMD parts to a board that I then cook in a skillet.  As goofy as this sounds, it actually works pretty well.  Most the time, I skip the solder paste and just use my iron, solder, flux pen and heat gun.  There are no surprises in this approach.  I put a dab of solder on one pad.  Use my tweezers to hold the part in place.  Then solder the other end.  Then I put a little flux on it nd heat it with an air gun (if I think the part needs to reflow a little -- makes things look nice).  As for flux.  I have never used the 'tacky flux'.  I see that people are using the 'no clean' tacky flux and that is intriguing.  I just use crappy old flux in a pen and clean it up afterwards with alcohol.  I say 'crappy' because the flux I use has a tendency to make things sticky if not cleaned up and it can be a pain.  Hope that helps.  Good luck with your projects."
electronics,351msg,WesPeros,4,Wed May 6 10:42:09 2015 UTC,"isn't reflow supposed to have a soak period, then up to peak for a short time then turn off?  like this http://www.sii-ic.com/en/semicon/files/2013/02/file_IMAGE_FILE_5461_IMAGE01.gif  you don't want thermal mass unless you have a conveyor system with thermal zones. you want the ICs to be at flow temp for as little time as possible, and you don't want to move the board by hand while at flow temp.  thermal mass is your enemy.  relays can also fail closed when they age and arc and weld shut. you can use a thermal fuse that will cut power in an over-temp situation.  since it's a hobby device you can also just not use it unattended."
electronics,351msg,chrwei,1 point,Wed May 6 13:57:06 2015 UTC,Thank you for pointing that out. I haven't done a lot with reflow just with vacuum chambers/ovens.
electronics,351msg,neutralchaos,2,Wed May 6 16:38:59 2015 UTC,"Looks great. I only have a couple small comments. For your thermal mass you might consider using a large(ish) piece of metal. Aluminum has a low specific heat and would be more ""responsive"" but would serve well I think. Another option would be to use a piece of steel. It won't heat up as fast, but if you are doing multiple boards in a row it will help maintain the temp better through door openings.  My other small change would be to use a mechanical relay instead of solid state. When we build equipment we aren't allowed to use a SSR on a heater because if it fails it will fail closed. A mechanical one would tend to fail open. I've see the results of a run away heater turn a vacuum chamber red hot. Omron has some small general purpose relays that might do what you want."
electronics,351msg,neutralchaos,1 point,Wed May 6 12:10:47 2015 UTC,"Cool, thanks for the advice. Do you have in mind having the aluminium piece inside during the reflow soldering? How would it affect the temperature profile? According to my understanding, it should slow it down.  The relay advice sounds great, I'll be sure to try it out one day soon. How are the mechanical relays good with PWM signals?"
electronics,351msg,_imjosh,3,Wed May 6 12:28:05 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't use a mechanical relay in this application.  Somewhere in the oven you should have found a thermal limit switch already built in (my coffee maker had both a limit switch and a non-resettable fuse. my hotplate had just a limit switch). If not, just add one.  Make sure it is rated to open at a fair amount over your target temperature otherwise it may interfere w/ the pid controller.  Just so you know, the cheap, fake fotek SSRs you will find vastly overstate their current ratings. That being said, if you get one, buy one w/ double or triple the oven's max draw and heat sink it and it should be ""ok""    The only problem I see w/ adding a big thermal mass is that for reflow you need the temperature to be able to rise and fall at fairly fast rates. From what I've read, getting a toaster oven to cool off at the recommended rates can be the more difficult part unless you have a way to open the door during the cool off period."
electronics,351msg,neutralchaos,1 point,Wed May 6 16:29:02 2015 UTC,"In my mind I would just leave the aluminum in there all the time. That way when you tune the PID the thermal mass gets included. I'm not sure how it would effect the profile. It would depend on how large the piece is, what its actual dimensional are, and where it is located. You could experiment with a few different sized pieces. If you get a little aluminum bar you could just use different lengths.  Mechanical relays don't do well with very fast PWM. Supposedly some of the smaller ones with a quick response can work fine depending on the parameters.   The other option to protect things is a thermostat switch. They can even be adjustable. If you get one, it can set the high limit of your oven and open it the oven tries to get hotter. You should set it above the temp you plan to use so it doesn't interfere with normal operation."

Easy to change and when one lamp dies, you really will notice it.  About temperatures and settings, preheating (idle temperature) is 150°C. When we start program, then oven stays for one minute at 150°C and then have 2 minutes and 15 seconds to reach 250°C, then program ends and goes back to 150°C. I'm not sure if it's optimal, but it was first working combination of time and temperature that worked with lead-free solder paste, so we let it like that.  Going from 150°C to 250°C takes about two minutes, so I rather added some time to be sure that everything will be soldered.

electronics,350pb6,a_jaded_triangle,3,Wed May 6 03:19:12 2015 UTC,"Q1 should be a P-channel MOSFET whose gate is connected to the cathode of D5. The combination of D5+C5+R1 creates a peak detector that shuts off Q1 when the AC supply is present.   Bear in mind that all MOSFETs have internal body diodes. If the internal power supply is active, Q1 will block current from coming in, but not from going out. You will see a non-zero voltage on the DC/battery terminals."
electronics,350pb6,InGaP,2,Wed May 6 04:00:09 2015 UTC,Thank you for the explanation - now it makes sense!  As for the non-zero voltage on the DC/battery terminals - does that mean the internal power supply will try to charge the installed batteries? Won't that make them blow up?
electronics,350pb6,InGaP,3,Wed May 6 04:05:18 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly, but it depends on the AC input voltage.  V_DC_OUT will be slightly lower than the peak voltage of the AC input due to rectifier voltage drops. If V_DC_OUT is greater than the battery voltage, some charge current will flow through the body diode into the battery. If V_DC_OUT is less than the battery voltage, current will want to flow out of the battery but will be safely blocked."
electronics,350pb6,InGaP,2,Wed May 6 04:20:50 2015 UTC,"The transformer I bought puts out 7.8V with no load (it's labeled as 6VAC 1A).   The batteries are 4x1.5V = 6VDC, and DC IN is also labeled 6VDC.  The radio has 4VDC regulators everywhere, so I'm assuming it expects around that much and regulates down to 4VDC.  The radio draws about 500mA at full volume at 6VDC supplied into the DC IN jack.  How much will the voltage drop be on the rectifier bridge? 4x0.6V=2.4V?   I guess if the internal supply puts out less than 6VDC (sounds like it might) then it won't try to charge the batteries. I guess the best solution is to take the batteries out when running the radio on AC power.  Thank you again for the thorough explanations!"
electronics,350pb6,InGaP,2,Wed May 6 04:29:57 2015 UTC,"Happy to help.  Are you certain that's the peak voltage? Multimeters usually measure RMS*. The reason I ask is because a 6VAC transformer would have a peak voltage of 6*sqrt(2) = 8.5V when loaded. If you measured 7.8Vrms unloaded, that's 11Vpk! That might be too much for the regulators, and certainly the batteries.  The rectifier will drop about half that because only two of the four diodes are ever active at one time depending on whether it is rectifying the positive or negative half of the cycle.  At this point I have to ask, do you have a compelling reason to use the AC supply instead of a DC wall wart? Because I can suggest a few circuit modifications like a Schottky diode in series with the battery or back-to-back MOSFETs or a separate regulator, but the simplest option is to use regulated DC input.  *Average vs. RMS is a separate discussion"
electronics,34zhcx,molochwalker,1 point,Tue May 5 21:08:43 2015 UTC,"What variant of PSPICE are you using? Student? Cadence OrCAD?   I don't know the OrCAD tools too well, but perhaps some general information can help you find relevant information. Usually you'd have to import a SPICE model (which only defines simulation behaviour), then create a symbol for it (which defines what it looks like in schematic view), and associate the model to the symbol.   In the case of say op-amps, SPICE packages often have a generic symbol with no simulation model, so that you can attach a model to it in the schematic view. Maybe there's a generic 8-pin symbol you can use.   If you're writing netlists by hand, you should be able to instantiate the SPICE model directly. I haven't done much direct netting editing so I can't help here."

And I don't want kill myself or start a fire.   But have wired a house and main power panel in the past (don't know if I recall everything I need to know; so I'm still researching).  Plus, I'm just in the sketching, layout, parts, & materials resourcing phase.  This won't be started for a while until I have everything measure & double check by a third party.  And with many baby steps of testing everything before and after it goes into the desk.  So, more likely I will be finished in year or more depending on my time to work on it (Or the new ideas that will make me redesign everything).    Really, all what's going on is:  Wall outlet, to table, to main power box hidden in table (may have a breaker/fuse), travel wire to switch (on/off kill switch), travel back to main power box.  The line ""loop"" will travel about 8 feet total in the internal wiring, just to have a kill switch.   One On/Off switch loop to kill everything in table   Then, two (or more, for future use) outlets on the side of main power box (3 pronged (US) connector, going to surge protection (or other protection, with many outlets to put in devices).  So it's another, travel loop to the switches (on/off) (after the surge protector), with normal 3 pronged (US) ""outlet"" disconnect"" at the power end to attach to  the Surge Protector, and to each individual device .  Again, the line ""loop"" will travel about 8 feet total in the internal wiring just to have a kill switch for each device.   Many ON/Off switch loop to kill individual devices     How much current will each line draw, max?   Unknown at this time.   What's the peak total current?    Unknown at this time   It's still unknown everything that will be going in the desk.  But about: Beastly Computer, maybe up to 3 computer monitors (more likely just one good ultra wide Monitor), Server/NAS (more of a wish Item), LED lighting, 2 pairs of Speakers,DAC - Preamp -Media Reciver,  A really good Solder Station, Charging Station for Phones/Tables/Laptops/etc, and some other random things.  I will test the power draw and find the max draw as well in paper work be installation of anything multiple times; before & after installation.  Once I find supplies to ""in theory"" make everything I want in the desk; it will become time ""Ball Park"" the load and peaks.  Then, re-sketch a few more time to distill the core ideas down to a blueprint and finally add some Flair/Style to the build.    What kind of box will it be in?   Plexi glass ""frame/drawer"" (or hang off the support structure) in a custom metal box out Aluminium or Steel.  Which I have access to make. Or even hardware store bought wiring box if it will work.   Are you planning on connecting earth grounds to each of your devices?    Everything should be grounded but maybe the power switches,  I have only seen seen in-line switches. I don't think there are ground button switches.  It least I have not seen them yet.

Of course you can find connectors with more data ports if you need.  http://www.lappusa.com/rectconnectors.htm  Of course, I'm sure Amphenol connectors makes what you need, but Epic was closer to your 'pin header' idea.

electronics,34yc7z,NoReallyItsTrue,1 point,Tue May 5 16:03:18 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there are lots (see: at least one) of SD card audio playback libraries, although it's been a while since I've worked on the platform. Have a look at Mozzi and Bastl instruments who have done an open source style sampler. It really depends on how much you need to play back.  In terms of audio encoding, the two file types you might use are probably going to be either MP3 or wav. Wav files are Pulse Code Modulated, and tend to have two important factors: bit depth and sampling frequency. Bit depth tells you how many parallel bits you need to represent it, and sampling frequency is how often the value is updated. If you wanted to output it at 16 bits (CD quality) you would probably want an external DAC with SPI or I2C. Check the arduino playground!  MP3 on the other hand is encoded and would require a specific (probably hardware) decoder.  Maybe have a look at Wolfson ? Although they might have been bought by cirrus logic.  Edit: http://uk.farnell.com/wolfson-microelectronics/wolfson-audio-card/audio-card-for-use-with-raspberry/dp/2347264 That's what I was thinking of, but it's Raspberry Pi based."

electronics,34yc7z,poundSound,1 point,Tue May 5 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"I'm probably more useful giving you some audio based advice rather than embedded solutions, so here is a quick primer:  CD quality: 44.1kHz, 16 bit DVD quality: 96kHz, 24 bit  Your DAC supports 48kHz (and up to 192kHz), which is approximately equivalent to the CD standard. Obviously if you're trying to send this over Bluetooth it will need data compression ( like MP3 ) because for stereo audio at CD quality, the bit rate is 1411kbps.  The DAC also takes an input serial stream, so you'll need to convert wav data to serial data with the correct format."

electronics,34vu80,jonathanrdt,25,Mon May 4 23:55:41 2015 UTC,"When a brush type permanent magnet toy motor spins, the coils on the armature generate a back voltage that reduces the current flow. Load down the speed, the voltage drops and the current increases. If you run the motor no-load then disconnect the power wires you can measure this self generated voltage with a voltmeter or better yet an oscilloscope. As the motor slows, the voltage will fall. Manually spin the armature faster and the voltage rises again, it's just like a generator. If you can work out a way to spin the motor shaft you could probably light that light bulb up too."

The torque produced is proportional to current through the motor while the back EMF (voltage it generates) is proportional to its speed.

electronics,34vu80,EkriirkE,2,Wed May 13 08:48:44 2015 UTC,"Motors, Meters and Magnets (from Electronicsnapcircuits wikia):       The motors (M1 and M4) convert elecricity into mechanical motion. Electricity is closely related to magnetism, and an electric current flowing in a wire has a magnetic field similar to that of a very, very tiny magnet. Inside the motor are three coils of wire with many loops. If a large electric current flows through the loops, the magnetic effects become concentrated enough to move the coils. The motor has a magnet inside so, as the electricity moves the coils to align them with the permanent magnet, the shaft spins. M4 spins slower than M1, but is more efficient, and spins better on solar cell. If a motor is in ""plus"", it spins clockwise, which will affect which way air is blown by a connected fan:   There are several types of fan: *  a yellow fan (discontinued), *  a red fan (shapes like yellow fan) (discontinued), *  a lighter red fan, *  a green fan with 3 blades, with the blade pitch going down to the right (discontinued), *  a green fan with 4-blades, with the pitch going up to the right. *  a red fan (shapes like yellow fan) (discontinued), *  a lighter red fan, *  a green fan with 3 blades, with the blade pitch going down to the right (discontinued), *  a green fan with 4-blades, with the pitch going up to the right. If a fan moves clockwise, it blows air up (except for the older version of the green fan). If it spins counter-clockwise, it blows air down (except for the older version of the green fan), and the red or yellow fan can fly off of the motor. If the green fan wobbles, you can balance it by using some tapes. Tape is enough weight to balance the fan. The meters (M2, M5, and M6) are very important indicating and measuring devices. You’ll use them to measure the amount of current or voltage depending on the circuit configuration. Notice the meter has a “+” sign, indicating the positive terminal (+ power from the batteries). The other snap is the negative terminal (– power return to batteries). The M2 meter has a switch to change between scales, indicated as LOW and HIGH (or 10mA and 1A). The electromagnet (M3) is a large coil of wire, which acts like a magnet when a current flows through it. Placing an iron bar inside increases the magnetic effects.

And LEDs can pass more current than their 20mA continuous rating for short times. Your absolute statement of:   An LED wouldn't pass/use enough current to drive a motor   Just irks me because (a) simple coloured LED's behave like diodes with a forward volt drop of about 2.0v and they don't ""use"" current so much as they will pass a lot depending on the circuit impedance, until they pop at a few hundred milliamps or slowly burn out at a few dozen milliamps. And (b) A few dozen milliamps is often enough to make those hobby motors rotate. Whether 1.0volts is enough is another question, but you said ""current"", not voltage. Also the motor may run after a kick start to get it moving.  If someone belives your statement they will immediately give up trying, but if you tell them it might work then they could go and try it and maybe learn something when they get a different result and start asking why.

electronics,34ty93,shoutpy,1 point,Tue May 5 13:13:37 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not really open any way you look at it.  Even with the schematic, you can't recreate the Teensy without the proprietary firmware that PJRC includes on the Mini54tan bootloader chip, and to get that you have to purchase those chips from them at a markup."
electronics,34ty93,macro312,2,Tue May 5 16:47:49 2015 UTC,"But isn't the chip on this the same as the Teensy LC which is ~$12 instead of ~$20?  Not arguing the other reasons one might choose this over a Teensy, though."
electronics,34ty93,macro312,9,Mon May 4 21:42:42 2015 UTC,"No. The Teensy LC uses a Freescale chip with only 8K of ram.   I'm not saying the Teensy or Teensy LC are bad boards.  Every microcontroller has its pros and cons.  But you have to consider more than price when selecting a microcontroller.    I used to use the Teensy myself, but when I found out I'd have to pay PJRC $8 for every board I manufactured because I would have to include their Mini54tan chip with their proprietary firmware on it if I wanted to allow my end users to update the firmware over USB, I said no thanks.    There was also the question of whether they could supply 250 of those chips on demand or if there would be a six week turnaround time, and whether the microcontrollers themselves would be in stock when I needed them.  I just checked Digikey and the stock on those chips they use is really low.  If I were just embedding the boards in my projects and I had no desire to move from that to manufacturing my own PCBs I could have kept using the Teensy, but that's wasn't true in my case."

electronics,34ty93,ArtistEngineer,2,Tue May 5 00:45:01 2015 UTC,Quesrion: What separates this from the Ardunio Zero? Unless it is just direct competition kind of thing.
electronics,34ty93,persnicketydingo,9,Mon May 4 22:20:09 2015 UTC,"It's much smaller, and much cheaper.  The Zero is 69x53mm.  My boards are 38x18mm.  So the Zero is 5x the size.    And the Zero sells for over $50.  My boards are less than $20.  I did have to remove the debug chip in order to get the size and price down, and I used a linear regulator instead of a switching regulator, but otherwise it's very much the same.   If you're wondering what the point is, lots of people buy Nanos, Pro Minis, and Micros because they're cheap and they want to permanently embed them in projects.  This fills the same niche but with a 32-bit processor.  Also, because the schematic is greatly simplified, it will be easier for a beginner to understand what needs to be included and what doesn't, when they go to start designing their own boards."

How do they compare in other terms?"
electronics,34ty93,YakumoFuji,2,Tue May 5 11:06:24 2015 UTC,"The Maple Mini has an ADC, but no DAC, and no I2S bus, making it unsuited to audio applications.  It has less RAM; only 20K, versus the 32K in the Neutrino, and it has only half as much flash (program) memory.    The board is physically larger too, by 50% and features the older and less reliable mini USB port instead of a micro USB.  It's also a two-sided design, which if you're into designing your own boards or want to manufacture them yourself is less convenient / more expensive.    I also see mention on Sparkfun's site that the board has problems with I2C."

I believe it should also be capable of mixing them and doing various effects.   Not sure I agree that micro USB is more reliable than mini USB - I find the connections to the board quite fragile in practice.    Well, the folks that invented USB seem to think so; they deprecated mini USB almost immediately after it was introduced.  Also the connectors were rated for something like 1K insertions, whereas the micro USB ones are rated for >100K.    When you say the connector is fragile though, I assume you're not talking about the contacts, but rather that you're breaking the whole thing off the board.  I did take that into consideration as well, and chose a part with through-hole strain relief so it shouldn't be an issue.   Oh, but does it support USB OTG?    The Neutrino does support USB OTG, but you'll need to provide a 5V supply to VIN when it's acting as host."

If 5V runs to VIN, won't there be a voltage drop at the USB pin due to voltage regulation? Or are VIN and the USB 5V pins common?   The 5V USB supply is connected to VIN through a fuse and PFET, oriented in such a way that the FETs body diode conducts when USB is powered but VIN is not.  Also, the PFET turns on when you connect the A side of a USB OTG cable, as this grounds the ID pin, which pulls down the PFET gate.  The PFET's gate can also be pulled down by the microcontroller to allow VIN to power the USB.  So no, there's no voltage drop between VIN and USB, but there is a voltage drop from the PFETs body diode between USB and VIN, but that doesn't matter since it just makes the 3.3V regulator's job easier.

electronics,34v26j,GoHooN,4,Mon May 4 20:18:37 2015 UTC,The use of a non-isolated supply in the kill-a-watt is not a problem because the case provides physical isolation.  Unless you are building in a case with similar physical isolation you should use an isolated supply.
electronics,34v26j,FullFrontalNoodly,5,Mon May 4 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"This is the right answer.  Make a hot power supply and make sure your case keeps the user safe.  Don't expose anything that might hurt the user (like a non-isolated USB jack, for instance).  I have done this project at a practical level and I can tell you that TVS diodes and ferrite beads are your friends.  Use the TVSs on the lines that touch the power (I found the biggest 'circuit killer' was ground bounce).  Use the ferrite beads on lines that might get an inductive spike (you don't want your reset line to bounce just because somebody turned on a vacuum cleaner).  So, you probably already know this but I will mention it for the casual reader... If you are going to play around with a hot power supply I suggest you purchase an AC power supply (with current limit) so when you make a mistake you don't get hurt.  A differential probe for your scope isn't a bad idea either.  O... and the op-amp approach of the Kill-A-Watt is fun (cascading gain stages, two simultaneous ADCs, computing reactive power from apparent and real power, ..etc.), but I actually ended up using this to do the actual power measurements.  This chip will keep track of power (apparent, real and reactive) and energy (same) so you don't have to do all the work in your microprocessor.  Plus, it knows current, voltage, power factor and zero crossing.  Good luck with your project."

But is it a zener diode?  a schottky diode?  an ""ultrafast"" diode?  What is its voltage rating?  What is its current rating?  I think a good next step would be to use a digital multimeter's continuity test (beep) feature, to find out which of the UC3842's pins (the 8 pin IC) connect to the diode's anode and which of the UC3842's pins connect to the diode's cathode.  That way you can look at some of the typical application circuits in the UC3842 datasheet to figure out which diode this is, and whether it's a zener or other kind of diode, and what voltage+current ratings it's likely to have.  Might as well use the DMM to see which other nearby components connect to the diode anode and which components connect to the diode cathode.  This will make it even easier to decide which application circuit is closest to your board, and even easier to decide which diode in the application circuit is your blown diode."

electronics,34ts2v,nilsph,1 point,Mon May 4 18:33:45 2015 UTC,"I think it was originally designed and built by Unitrode Semiconductor.   Texas Instruments bought the entire Unitrode company and so I would recommend using the TI datasheet.  You are correct, the chip on your board is in the 8 pin DIP package.  Check whether the bad diode appears to have failed as a short; does your tester say there is continuity thru this diode?  (probably not).  Also check whether the bad capacitor has failed as a short; is there continuity thru the cap?  (probably not).  If not then you don't need to remove them to test continuity from one place to another; if those things are NOT shorts, they won't screw up the continuity testing.  When you look at the datasheets (or Google Images when you search for UC3842 schematics), you'll see that a common circuit ""idiom"" in UC3842 applications is a trio of (diode + resistor + capacitor).   The resistor and capacitor act as a ""snubber"" for the diode.  When the board failed, the dead diode may have wrecked its buddy resistor or its buddy capacitor in a snubber, so you'll want to know which resistors and which capacitors the dead diode connects with."

I work mostly on the lower layers and so I encounter systems on TIA/RS-485, powerline signals and 0-10V control buses, as well as modern-day hippy bluetooth and wifi things meant for being controlled directly by phones and tablets.  In the telco industry there is a  push to get into providing ""cloud backed"" hosting and control systems for home automation and industrial asset management. I've seen some of this work, and there is a couple of new standards from Broadband Forum defining them. Some of it does what I think you are describing, and acts like a ""fabric"" for bridging any number of different control systems and protocols inside one owned administrative domain and solving the matter of protocol/interface incompatibility by introducing an IP abstraction layer. Which I think is not a novel or new idea. And one that can be easily messed up and turned into a terrible thing nobody wants to touch and we're back to that XKCD thing again.   But the idea basically amounts to a standard where ""gateways"" are expected to create IP-addressable, interoperable, standardized representation objects for devices and control signals on whatever is on the other side of that gateway. These objects then offer self-description, permission management and publication/subscription mechanisms for any of the control signals coming and going. The part of this that you may like is that the design seems very open ended when it comes to application logic and it is trivial to create a compatible ""gateway"" that correctly implements the management protocol on the IP side.   I like to use a system called Max/MSP personally, for hosting the brains of my own home automation setups. Similar to the telco standard I mentioned above, it allows me to create simple ""gateways"" to the different buses I use to link devices, aside from plain ethernet (RS-485, CAN-bus, DMX, 433 MHz radios, etc), and objects representing ins and outs and functions of the different devices that can then be visually linked with ""noodles"" on the screen representing logic bindings, and other types of objects to display state information or implement timers, interlocks, calendar-based policies, notifications, alarms, etc. I then host a simple API from MAX to connecting phone and tablet UIs.   My setups have included rich clients with sprawling estates so large that we had to use fiber optics to link the driveway entrance gate controllers to the central compound buildings."

electronics,34qb1r,alectronics,2,Mon May 4 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"Neat! I'm in Industrial Automation for a living, so I think we're on somewhat similar paths.   I like good old fashion wires and open TCP/UDP protocols. I suppose I don't mind new standards...  It's closed technology that I keep running into.   I've got an old PLC in my basement controlling a few things. I'd love to be able to interface that to some of the modern Home Automation equipment without a hacked together ""gateway"". Give me a Wink Hub that has contacts to close, or a simple Server/Client interface. My PLC can generate voltages, currents, switch closures, TCP/UDP packets, serial comms... I feel like I should be able to use those to interface directly to HA products."

electronics,34qb1r,wanderingbilby,2,Mon May 4 07:08:03 2015 UTC,"I'll see what I can scrounge up that isn't NDA-afflicted. Probably easiest to share my art/side-project things.   For example, I could perhaps make a post about a recently completed little project that was essentially inventing a better button for an interactive exhibit. Just lots of trivial low-tech put together to solve a problem with reasonably simple wiring (that the not-for-profit customer can easily service after delivery.)  I use Teensy3.1 as my go-to MCU platform of choice. It is fast and plenty powerful for everything short of rich UI touch screen type apps (for which I use Android tablets.) Because smart people at PJRC provided an Arduino wrapper for it, I can easily ask my clients to install the requisite software and update the firmware on the thing without having to configure a big old clunky toolchain that only linux nerds can figure out."

electronics,34qb1r,frumperino,3,Mon May 4 14:57:03 2015 UTC,"Why do you prefer doing this (which surely is time consuming) over just sticking thicker wire directly into breadboard?  Apart from aesthetics that is, it does look quite nice."
electronics,34qb1r,jrmxrf,16,Sun May 3 20:58:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not religious about it, and sometimes I use a mix of different connector types depending on what is practical and which bits are still experimental or need to be removable / reconfigurable during operation.   I like how tidy and compact the wiring gets, and how I can manage buses and trunk wires going to different parts of a project with a level of clarity that I just don't think jumper wires allow. It is only when my wire wrap projects look like this that I start to contemplate spinning a circuit board instead.  And as I mentioned before, the wire wrap connections are stupidly secure and don't come apart unless you want them to.  I use a simple handtool that looks like this - it stripts kynar wire, wraps and unwraps. And a small pair of cutters. To make connections in the breadboard I stick in reusable 8+8mm pin headers.   With practice it is a very fast and simple process and it takes only a few seconds to make a connection on either end with it and I don't consider it in any way a chore or bother that I'd be tempted to just skip and use jumpers instead. To reclaim the pin headers from a wirewrapped breadboard I just use the ""unmake"" end of the tool to twist the wire ends off and the pins go back in the box. But they're so cheap it almost doesn't matter."
electronics,34qb1r,eubarch,3,Sun May 3 21:30:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, maybe I'll even give it a try. Does the quality of this tool matters? Or is it simple enough that almost any should work? Any recommendations are welcome."
electronics,34qb1r,frumperino,2,Sun May 3 21:57:57 2015 UTC,"In my experience, the cheap wire wrap tools can be almost unusable compared to the model posted above."
electronics,34qb1r,bart2019,3,Sun May 3 22:42:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. Get the type with a hexagonal profile and built in stripper. Should be only about $15 or less.   In the heyday of wirewrap there used to be awesome automatic wrappers that cut stripped and twirled wire to a pin in one fast operation. Haven't seen a working one for decades. :-?

electronics,34qb1r,Paumanok,27,Mon May 4 16:06:58 2015 UTC,"In 1982, I took a class called ""Microprocessor Lab"" at school, where we had to design and build a microprocessor based project. A friend and I designed a small general purpose 68K system, and then each built it. We both used wire wrap.  Here is mine.  You'll probably notice some odd parts choices. That can almost all be explained by budget. The way this lab worked is that the school gave you the processor, and some other expensive parts (EPROM, RAM), but everything else you had to buy yourself.  For example, the weird plug in the top right of the first photo is something I found in a surplus store, along with its mate. They were cheap, and had enough pins to use as a power connector (I needed ground, +5 V, +12 V, and I'm not sure but I think I needed -12 V).  I did splurge a little on the serial ports. I could have hooked the DB-25 connectors up with soldered wire, which would have cost less than those ribbon cables with the DIP connectors on end, but I specifically wanted the serial ports to connect to the motherboard with a removable connector that was non-keyed so it could be connected two ways. The socket is wired so that connecting the cable works both ways, but one of them is wired to act as a null modem. Note that one of the DB-25 connectors is male and one is female. Combined with the built in optional null modem, this meant I could hook this up to any computer or terminal that had a DB-25 serial connector, without ever needed to hunt for a gender changer or null modem.  I have two amusing (I think) stories about that class.  1. Another student in the lab was very annoying. He was actually a nice guy...what was annoying was that everything he built always worked on the first try, even though he made numerous mistakes when designing and building.  How could this be? Whenever he made a mistake, he would somehow make a compensating mistake that cancelled it. For example, he might design something and put a NOR gate in his schematic where he intended a NAND gate. Then when he later went to make a parts list he'd look up a NOR gate, and misread the part number, ending up with the part number for the NAND gate. Then when he's wiring it up, he'd use the pinout from the data sheet for the NOR gate he thought he bought, but he'd miscount the pins on the socket and wire it up wrong--coincidently ending up with the right pins for the NAND gate.  And he did this several times.  2. There was an HP minicomputer in the lab. It controlled the EPROM programmer. To build software for my computer, I had to edit my assembly code on the HP. Then there was a program that would make and submit a batch job to the school's IBM 370, which was where the 68k cross assembler and linker ran. The program on the HP would retrieve the results, and then you could burn an EPROM. There were similar tool chains and procedures for the various other microprocessors used in the lab, all centered on that HP.  This HP was not used just by undergraduates taking the Microprocessor Lab course. It was used by basically everyone in the EE department doing microprocessor work, including graduate students for their research, as well as professors.  Unfortunately, people had not done a good job of organizing the data on it, and the drive was getting full after several years of all this use. They couldn't really delete stuff, because no one knew what was crap, and what was something vital to someone's PhD thesis work (yes, they should have had a copy somewhere else, but the administrators were not willing to risk it).  So by the time I was in the class, they had started to at least try to keep the problem from getting worse. We had to work in particular directories, and clean up after ourselves, and were warned files there would be deleted after the class completed. So, they were managing to keep limping along, but it was not a pleasant situation.  Well, one day I noticed that in all the commands we used to copy files, there was a place where we had to type an ""A"". I don't actually remember if it was an ""A"". It was some specific magic letter or number, that all the instructions that everyone simply copied when working with that system specified.  I wondered what would happen if I put a ""B"" there instead. It said the command succeeded, but I did not see the file in my directory. I noticed that the same magic ""A"" was in the directory command, so I tried ""B"" there.  There was my file--on the second, empty (except for my file), drive that no one knew the computer had!"

You do need to have the correct stripping tool that doesn't knick the wire though, as a nick dramatically weakens the wire  I don't wire wrap the ends, as it solders very well.

electronics,34qb1r,justfarmingdownvotes,3,Sun May 3 23:43:07 2015 UTC,"Well a wire stripping tool has that part through the middle for stripping wires so I imagine it's probably a good idea... even if it does sometimes work without stripping them first, which I have never tried... I hope your coop boss has a good time debugging every single project he works on trying to figure out which wires aren't making good electrical contact...   Funny thing is it was the stripping of the wires with that tool that killed it for me, it makes this high pitched noise that basically makes my soul cringe.

electronics,34qb1r,Minifig66,7,Mon May 4 11:55:05 2015 UTC,"Wire wrap is still useful today, and all the needed components are still available. I found it can even be used in relatively noncritical, low frequency analog circuits. If you're smart, you can recover most of the components afterward.   Read Tracy Kidder's 'Soul of a New Machine'. When minicomputers were a thing, wire wrap was commonly used for the early prototypes. In some computers, wire wrap went right through to production.   When I designed an embedded computer based on the CDP1802 in 1983-5, I used wire wrap. It likely saved six months or more on the project."
electronics,34qb1r,DangerousBill,14,Sun May 3 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"Take a look at a telecoms backplane, or ask a telco engie. (These days IDC is increasingly common mind.) Wire wrap everywhere. The connections made by wire wrap are more robust and reliable, and if you need to change a circuit, then you can quicky unwrap and rewrap without all the faff of desoldering.  For modern electronics however, wirewrap is obsolete, except for very complex prototype things, or prototypes that need to be reliable. (My 7400 TTL CPU is built with wire wrap, for example.)"
electronics,34qb1r,unsubscribe__,11,Sun May 3 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"Also, a wire wrap joint on square gold pins is a cold weld, with an ohmic resistance of about a milliohm, or about 20 x less than a solder joint.

electronics,34qb1r,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Mon May 4 03:59:01 2015 UTC,"It was useful for prototyping purposes. You used to smash nails onto a breadboard, wrap a wire around and quickly be able to make a circuit. Modern prototyping boards kept the name, but now you just plug in cables.  Second to that, which is why it's almost never seen anywhere today."
electronics,34qb1r,Leeps,6,Mon May 4 16:12:14 2015 UTC,It was useful in production as well.  Before the days of CAD for PCBs everything had to be laid out by hand.

Keep in mind that the wires going back to the arduino are going to have significant capacitance, and are probably going to mess with your measurement unless you calibrate it properly.   My original plan (for which the linked board was the test bed) was to include the uC and the capacitance measuring bridge on the pcb itself, in order to limit these effects. Now obviously if you are going to bury it, this may or may not be a good idea ;)  Btw, if you are designing a new sensor, I urge you to look at the feature sizes. My first prototype has a fairly wide insulator band, and that dramatically reduces the capacitance of the sensor. For a new design I recommend tightening that up as far as the DRC will allow."

On your board, U2, the black square at the top, is an LED and a phototransisor that allows the low side to signal the high side (but is isolated via light) without being physically connected.  Could be a number of things, but it sounds like the control circuit isn't seeing any feedback from the output when it tries to fire up the circuit, so it shuts down. If the load works, then it's not shorted. Could be a bad diode or capacitor feeding the transistor side of u2 or a bad capacitor on the load output."

The voltage regulator (thing with the aluminium heat sink on it) might have some kind of thermal protection circuit inside it.

electronics,34p8wj,wormoil,3,Sun May 3 11:07:00 2015 UTC,"The passive cooled ones have gaps around them that allow air flow to the ceiling space. I think the idea of this design was to eliminate that gap.   But the new units are a more efficient 7 watt with the passive heatsink, no fan.

electronics,34p8wj,mordacthedenier,1 point,Sun May 3 11:28:45 2015 UTC,"10W or even 7W is a tall order to dissipate with such a small heatsink when the LED chips should ideally remain under 85C and the heatsink probably at less than 65C. In reality the LED chips are probably running closer to 100C and the heatsink at 80C, but what can you do.   If you have a fairly closed light fixture for the lamps, the lamps are either going to throttle down to compensate or outright fry. Cooling 13W LED lamps in E27 form factor or 10W in GU10 is a nightmare if your design budget doesn't allow for a complicated convective heatsink structures."

electronics,34p8wj,ONXwat,1 point,Mon May 4 04:47:32 2015 UTC,"Those are nice and all but exposed aluminum surfaces require more expensive solutions to maintain electrical safety. From the 120/230V viewpoint the LED chips are barely isolated from the heatsink. They're only separated by a very thin dielectric layer on an aluminum core PCB which is not good enough to guarantee electrical safety. To counter this they have to use more complicated and better isolating power supplies and those cost money. The difference in cost doesn't seem that dramatic but remember that we're talking about a few cents less on the bill of materials making all the difference.  *IKEA's subcontractors for example have solved this problem by using a cheap power board and a cheap diecast aluminum heatsink that they shrouded in a 2 mm thick plastic sleeve. To me it looks like the plastic sleeve is filled with some kind of a mineral filler, probably to increase the plastic's heat conductivity. This way they retain some heat sinking properties and also insulate the metal parts towards the consumer."

Do you literally need to address ~900KG of LEDs?  No uC or SoC is going to have enough IO built in to do this, so you need to either have multiple devices or expanders or both. Different methods of adding IO have different capabilities and requirements. Do you need to drive them with 100% duty cycle or is multiplexing/charlie-plexing an option? A simple serial to parallel shift register is going to be quite cheap, but probably won't have a good enough update speed and if you are charlieplexing then you need tristate outputs. I2C expanders might be fast enough, but they will be more expensive and then maybe you still need to have multiple buses in order to get enough bandwidth to update them all or maybe your master CPU becomes the bottle neck. So maybe you have multiple sub-segments, but now you probably want to sync them so you need a low latency communications protocol for that.

That is just one way to avoid various potential limitations (processing speed, update speed, pixel address space) of a single Arduino.  Another possible shortcut: these music visualizers are often symmetrical in the X or Y axis, or both.    If your output is X/Y symmetrical you can cut the processing and addressing by 75%.  You can even use mirrors and cut the pixel count by 75%!  The point is: it's natural to picture the solution as a x*y pixel array and stream frames to it, but your problem is much simpler than that.  You don't necessarily need a general-purpose LED monitor.  Pay attention to the available shortcuts and try to exploit them."

electronics,34q0b9,dokid,2,Mon May 4 11:19:59 2015 UTC,eevblog has some videos explaining opamps on youtube.
electronics,34q0b9,chibiace,2,Sun May 3 15:24:41 2015 UTC,"As with many things in life, there's theory and then there's reality...  In theory, an opamp is a complicated circuit that computes the difference between two voltages, multiplies that difference by like a million, and then outputs that as a voltage. So if you fed in 1.03V and 1.05V, the opamp would theoretically output (1.05 - 1.03)*1,000,000 = 20,000V.  Of course in reality that doesn't happen, for a lot of reasons. One of the reasons is that in reality we always use an opamp as a part of a larger circuit. And the rest of the larger circuit pretty much always uses some kind of feedback. (Taking some portion of the opamp's output and looping it back into one of the opamp's input. Usually it's the negative (""inverting"") input.)  This feedback is critical because it allows the opamp to ""notice"" what its own output is, and ""compare"" that output with what it should be, and then correct the output to make it closer to the correct value. This continuous, self-correcting feedback is the key to pretty much every opamp circuit.  If you want, I'll try and explain the two most common opamp circuits (the voltage buffer and the gain stage) in terms how how feedback makes them do what they do. Just leave a comment below this one and ask.  But for now I'm going to stop. Because the above may already have you mentally overwhelmed, and I want to give you a chance to pause and digest it for a bit."
electronics,34q0b9,ModernRonin,-1,Sun May 3 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"First two paragraphs made sense. Just learnt about feedback in that EEVblog #600 video, so that sorta makes sense now.  I always get confused when people are explaining electronics and they make it seem like these circuits can think.. Theyre just a pile of plastic and copper, how can they 'notice' something. My stupid mechanical brain xD"
electronics,34q0b9,ModernRonin,2,Sun May 3 16:56:12 2015 UTC,"Hence why I put ""notice"" and ""compare"" in quotes.  The input stage of most opamps is a differential amplifier circuit. And this is what ""notices"" the difference between the two input voltages. The diff amp is part of the ""hard stuff"" that Dave didn't want to talk about, but I think for certain kinds of people it's helpful to understand how it works. Once they understand the mechanism, they can accept it and move on to understanding the behavior of the entire opamp circuit.  The most common way to build a differential amplifier circuit is to use a ""Long Tailed Pair"" aka LTP. Look at the picture there. Ignore RC1 and RC2 for the moment, just look at the two NPN transistors with their emitters tied together, and the resistor to ground.  Current flows out of the emitters, and then through the resistor and into ground. That current flow through the resistor causes a voltage difference across the resistor, in accordance with V = IR. Since the bottom of the resistor is tied to ground (which by definition is 0 volts) and the current is flowing downard through the resistor, the current makes the top of the resistor go upwards in voltage.  Simple example. Let's say the resistor is 1k ohm and the current is 3 mA. We use V=IR:  V = .003 A * 1000 ohms V = 3 V   The voltage at the top of the resistor will be 3V.  Okay, now image what would happen if the voltage at one transistor's base is 3.7V, and the voltage at the other transistor's base is 2.9V.  The base-emitter voltage of the 3.7V transistor is 3.7-3.0 = 0.7V. That transistor is turned on hard, and conducting like crazy!  The 2.9V base transistor's Vbe is (2.9 - 3.0) = -0.1V. That transistor is all the way off. Maybe a couple nano-amps of leakage current, at the very most.  So, the circuit can tell which transistor is ""seeing"" a higher base voltage. The one that is conducting a lot of current has a higher base voltage. That's how voltages can be compared. And that's how the input stage of an opamp works."
electronics,34q0b9,ModernRonin,2,Sun May 3 17:22:50 2015 UTC,"the circuit can tell which transistor is ""seeing"" a higher base voltage. The one that is conducting a lot of current has a higher base voltage. That's how voltages can be compared.   Having said that, the purpose of RC1 and RC2 can now be explained. Basically, they are there to convert the current into a voltage.  The current coming from the power supply (+5V?) has to go through RC1. In doing so, it suffers a voltage drop by V=IR. Since the top of RC1 is pegged to a constant voltage, the only possible outcome is for the current to push down the voltage at the bottom of RC1.   Again, simple example... let's say RC1 is 100 ohms and there is 15mA of current flowing through it. This causes a voltage drop of:  V = IR V = .015 A * 100 ohms V = 1.5 V   If the supply voltage is 5V, then 1.5V will be subtracted from it, and we will see (5 - 1.5) = 3.5V at the bottom of RC1.  If the amount of current increases, there will be a greater drop across the resistor, and the voltage at the bottom of RC1 will go down. If the current decreases, the voltage drop across resistor will be less, and the voltage at the bottom of RC1 will go up.  Not all opamps use collector resistors to convert the current to a voltage like this. But most of them do."

electronics,34q0b9,Purple-mastadon,2,Sun May 3 20:52:30 2015 UTC,"Op amps can get tricky, but they are cool.   Many chips have two or more op amps with a single positive voltage +VCC (rail) input and a single ground or negative voltage -VDD (rail) input for all integrated op amps in the chip.   The amplification is usually around 250,000 or more without a feedback resistor network.   The two inputs (+ and -) for each op amp can be connected to each other or to two different sources.   + is noninverting,  -  is inverting.   Used as a comparator,  whichever input has a higher voltage will output from their respective ""rail""  + will give you the max positive voltage that the chip is connected to at +VCC, or positive rail, -  input will give you ground or max negative voltage, depending on what you hooked -VDD or negative rail up to.   Using two resistors in a feedback loop from output to the inverting input will give you Rf/R amplification of the noninverting input.   Extending that feedback from the total circuit output back to inverting input will allow the op amp to drive everything without lagging.   They are really easy to make audio amps out of,  as well as switches.   Much easier than bjts"

So if I have an op amp powered by +12 volts at the positive rail and ground or 0 volts at negative rail, and I input +1 volt into the + input and zero volts at -  input, the output could be +1 volt multiplied 250,000 times.   Since we only have +12 volts for the op amp it will be the max,  or +12 volts, or saturating the positive rail.     If we hooked up 1 volt to the - input,  and zero volts to the + input, we would saturate the negative rail, or ground in this case,  so 0 volts output."

electronics,34q0b9,fatangaboo,4,Sun May 3 16:52:15 2015 UTC,"Op-amps are commonly used, among other reasons, to scale sensor outputs to an appropriate voltage range for analog-to-digital conversion. E.g.,  a tachometer may only output several millivolts at full scale - but you want it to scale it between 0 and 3.3v so that you can read a full range of values with your ADC.  Also, C is taught because it is what many embedded control systems are programmed in. What do you think controls engines these days? Hint: lots of software."
electronics,34q0b9,fatangaboo,2,Sun May 3 17:09:56 2015 UTC,"We most certainly do use analog computing still. Have a square wave and want a triangle wave? Use an op amp to make an analog integrator and run the square wave through it. Hello, triangle wave.  Have a signal and need a signal that represents how fast it is changing? Use an op amp to make an analog differentiator.  Another wide use of op amps is filtering. With op amps, you can make simple active filters that outperform simple RLC passive filters, and take up much less space because they don't need an inductor.  When used as amplifiers, they provide extremely high input impedance, and very low output impedance, so they draw almost no current from the input, and they can supply a good amount of current to the output without the voltage dropping. When used as amplifiers, the exact characteristics are determined by a small number of external components, so you can easily get the particular characteristics you need.  Op amps are the building blocks of modern analog electronics in a way similar to how logic gates are the building blocks of digital."

electronics,34obqe,Minecraftian1998,2,Sun May 3 00:38:47 2015 UTC,Maximum power output can be achieved when the resistance of the load is equal to the resistance of the power source.   for example a 10v power supply has a source resistance of 50 ohms. in order to deliver maximum power out the load has to equal 50 ohms.  P=V2 /R  we can look at source resistance and load resistance as resistors in series.   so for a 25ohm load P= 102 /(50+25)  P=1.3w  for 50 ohms  P=1w  for 100 ohms   P=.666w  now you can see that we get a high power out put with the lower resistance but then that requires more current. We get a lower current usage with the higher resistance but in order to get a higher power output we would need more voltage. so when the load and source are equal we get  the best of both worlds  so with the previous perimeters P=I2 R I=sqrt(P/R) so for the 25 ohm load  I=130ma  for 50 ohm  I=100ma  for 100ohm  I=66ma

electronics,34l9pv,sdmorr,1 point,Sun May 3 16:40:21 2015 UTC,"Another, lower-drop approach is to use a P-channel MOSFET. -- this lets you see only a transistor's Rds(on) instead of a fixed Schottky drop.  Set it up with the body diode pointing the same direction you'd put your PMEG4002, then tie the gate to GND.  Source is Vout, and drain is Vin.  Let's see I can draw it in ascii art...           +--->|---+  (body diode)          |        | Vin -----+--|__|--+----- Vout          D  ---- S               |G              |              --- GND   1) In the blocking case, suppose you attached -5V to the input.  Assuming the circuit starts out unpowered, Vout is 0V, so Vgs = 0V and the PMOS stays turned off.  Any reverse leakage will only bring Vout to slightly negative (same as in your design) which further drives Vgs positive (the wrong way to turn on PMOS) so it stays off.  2) In the forward case, suppose you apply +5V to Vin.  The body diode conducts, just as your Schottky would, developing (5V - Vdiode) on Vout, so Vgs is perhaps -4.4V.  Assuming you've chosen an appropriate transistor, this should be well below Vgs for your transistor, so it'll fully turn on.  Figure 5 in this app note."

Specs:   - powered by an STM32F405RG @ 16MHz 168MHz   - 6.0 m/s2 translational acceleration   - 0.4 m/s search speed   - Somewhat complex (ha) on-chip route planning and path execution   - Software written in the D programming language (with the hardware interface wrapped in C)  I've got some other videos on my channel of the mouse's performance as I've been improving the software. I think it's fun to see how much better it runs as time goes on :-)   Thanks for watching!  Edit: Some shots of the mouse as it exists today, vs what it looked like just as a PCB: https://imgur.com/a/2a9bD"
electronics,34hhnf,Pigsquirrel,4,Fri May 1 04:55:14 2015 UTC,"Proud member of the STM32 master race here, and also a budding D enthusiast. How did you get D to compile for the STM32?   I'm curious because I've been experimenting lately with using things other than C and C++ on the STM32. I actually had Ruby sort of working thanks to mruby, but got a little sad when the mruby VM tried to do 300K worth of mallocs right from the start."
electronics,34hhnf,Pigsquirrel,1 point,Fri May 1 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"I use GDC built as a cross compiler on OSX10.10.   Versions of the software I use to perhaps avoid some headache in the future:   $ arm-none-eabi-gdc --version arm-none-eabi-gdc (GCC) 4.9.2 $ arm-none-eabi-objcopy --version GNU objcopy (GNU Binutils) 2.25   This guide helped me a lot while setting up the toolchain: http://wiki.dlang.org/Bare_Metal_ARM_Cortex-M_GDC_Cross_Compiler  Getting the stdperiph library for the STM was the biggest hassle, but even that wasn't too bad. Just a lot of setting up compiler and linker flags to be able to find the stdperiph library, and some custom rules in the mouse's makefile to compile them all into an archive I linked against.   Ruby would be neat having running on a device like this, if only due to the insanity factor :P  Edit: I also want to say that D was a really great choice for writing the firmware of the mouse in. The maze solver and map/maze representation all use a lot of templated code and metaprogramming, which D made easy to implement. I had to rip out all of Phobos as it's not building for stm yet, but the parts I needed were pretty straightforward to implement myself (just some functions from std.math mostly). Interfacing with the C wrapper was about as straightforward as it gets: just copy/pasting the C header file and making some minor changes to declarations, wrapped in one big extern(C) block. There are also a few places where C calls into D, which worked just fine too."
electronics,34hhnf,Pigsquirrel,1 point,Fri May 1 16:54:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the link.  I was mostly interested in getting Ruby to run on it so I could implement all of the drivers etc. in C and the communication library and business logic in Ruby, so that it could be reused PC side for the other end of of the communications link. Trying to get Ruby to run on a STM32F411 with FreeRTOS was definitely way up there in the ""insanity factor"". I had to get a working-enough malloc() and free(), which meant making newlib happy enough with FreeRTOS to run. Also had to skeleton port open(), read(), and write() and some ghetto file descriptors for USARTs to try to use the Ruby IO functions. Eventually it all linked, but I stopped poking at it once I ran into the ungodly amounts of malloc() calls from the VM.  D might also be a good option to try to implement the communications library. I really don't want to have two separate implementations for PC-side and device-side, but implementing it PC-side in C would just suck. C++ for embedded just requires too much boilerplate to actually wrap everything properly, but gluing D to C is pretty easy. I was actually considering trying it, but never bothered to give it a Google. I'm glad to see it in action, since it would be really cool to use D for the project I'm working on.

Long story short, the first pass consumed all the sections and set labels to the correct addresses, then the second time around it set all those labels to point to the end of the binary (as all sections had been consumed). That took two days to figure out."

It actually is really nice: all of the ""slutty"" convenience features of Java -- garbage collected references, easy classes with automatic hierarchy from Object, Interfaces -- but in a compiled language that spits out real .o files and you can just gcc them to link against any library ever.   Compared to C++, you can have all of the nice structure and pragmatic design without needing a thousand man-hours of boilerplate to set up all of your const &refs and overriding the assignment operator for your pointers. It's really nice.  As far as ripping out Phobos, that wouldn't really bug me since I haven't actually used it much yet. I'm still just really playing around with core language features and linking it against a bunch of other things right now and haven't gotten to the point of playing with the standard library."

electronics,34hhnf,joeflux,1 point,Mon May 4 22:50:26 2015 UTC,"Here is the how you calculate the values of load capacitors used for crystal: Load Capacitance = [(Cd x Cg)/(Cd+Cg)]+Cic+△C where Cd and Cg are the 2 capacitor you placed on each side of the crystal. Cic is the capacitance of IC, usually 3-5pF experimentally. and I usually ignore △C as the capacitance on PCB since no high speed device is involved.  Since Cd usually is same as Cg, we can simplify the equation to  Load Capacitance = [(Cd x Cd)/(Cd+Cd)]+Cic = Cd/2+Cic  therefore Cd = (LC - Cic) x 2  If Lc is 8pF, I say Cic is 3-5pF, Cd will be 6-10pF  most of the CL for crystal running at 8MHz(normally used for stm32) I used are 18pf, therefore the Cd will be 26-30pF, however it can be lower, I made it worked at 18pF before. If you don't have the exact value of capacitor needed for crystal, higher is better than lower value just in case it's too low to make the crystal oscillate."

With regards to my other question, a series resistor, I just received my new PCB that features a 24MHz HSE and things seem to be working well.

electronics,34hhnf,ShinyCyril,1 point,Fri May 1 08:53:48 2015 UTC,"Encoders on the motors, and the IR sensors are used for feedback when going in straight lines to keep the bot centered (and for calibrating distance when doing things like going into smooth turns). I regret not putting some sort of gyro and accelerometer on the mouse, as wheel slippage is a very real issue when doing fast turns. The bot used to use position control, but it was too hard to keep it from shooting off the map when accelerating. Now it uses speed control instead, and that seems to be working much better."

I learned a lot about controller theory from there and how to apply it to the mouse.   I won't go into too much detail, but the mouse does something similar to what Green describes (on his website under Project Futura -> Controller and Curve Turn): The mouse executes speed profiles for translational movement, and rotational movement (or both at the same time to execute a curve turn).   A speed profile is a set of instructions that say ""accelerate this much up, stay at this speed/go this distance at this constant velocity, accelerate down to this speed"". The total distance including the speed up and slow down are fairly simple to calculate with the kinematics equations you learned in physics. The mouse knows how fast it can accelerate translationally (mm/sec2) and rotationally (rads/sec2), so some more math lets you generate speed profiles to get you from one arbitrary velocity to another arbitrary velocity, over some arbitrary distance.  Green generates his speed profiles ahead of time. The difference with my mouse is it generates all dynamic speed profiles at runtime (with some precomputed for doing standard ""forward 1 cell, we already know the starting and ending velocities), which lets me do things like change the radius of the curve turn if the mouse has over or undershot.   Lemme know if you've got any more questions, I can try and post a writeup somewhere."

electronics,34hhnf,saxonmassive,2,Fri May 1 09:40:51 2015 UTC,"The pause is the mouse doing an alignment to the wall to the front of it before doing a turn. It does this because it hadn't known a wall was going to be there, and slightly overshot. It's partly a bug in the code, and partly there to ensure the mouse is always ending in the center of a cell before deciding where to go next."
electronics,34hhnf,Dr_Tower,1 point,Fri May 1 16:39:22 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the mouse constantly uses the IR sensors to sense distance in front of it. When it detects the distance is below a certain amount it turns. The direction of that turn is based on the other IR sensors on the corners (arranged in a sort of semi circle configuration). From this I would guess that during that pause between turns it is taking a measurement from each sensor, calculating the distance to the nearest object, then deciding which way to turn."

Edit: It went into the dead end because it hadn't explored all the cells in the maze yet. There's a chance that it could find a faster path to the target cell if it explores further.   The potential to go straight into a smooth turn is certainly there. It complicates the software a by a good factor though, because of the way the maze solver and driving algorithm works. It's certainly being worked on though. I'm hoping to have it working by next week, I'll certainly post it on my channel."
electronics,34hhnf,alexforencich,2,Fri May 1 17:12:50 2015 UTC,"There are two dead end forays that I'm referring to.  The first is on the first trip from start to finish, while exploring. I get why it entered that dead end path. I don't get why it turned left and went forward. Could it not see after turning left that there was a dead end one square ahead that it didn't need to visit? This happens at 0:11  The second one is more concerning to me. On the return trip, from finish to start, while still exploring. It explores a dead end that it already has all of the information about from having seen the other side of every wall in question. Why didn't it know that? This happens at 0:22"
electronics,34hhnf,Greendunk,1 point,Fri May 1 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"The dead end at 0:11 - it can't see further than the cell that it's currently in reliably, so it thought perhaps there might not be a west wall in the cell that it dead ended at.  The one at 0:22 - It didn't know the state of the wall to the east of the cell it dead ended in. If I made the algorithm more advanced, it could indeed tell that it couldn't have gotten a more optimal path out of that information regardless of wall state, but for now the mouse will try and determine the wall state of all cells it can possibly access.   Perhaps in the future I'll go back and put in some checks to ensure that all cells traversed could possibly lead to a more optimal path, but that's a ways off, and I can't think of an immediate way to make that check without a lot of processing power or memory allocations. Also, the competition awards points based off of most cells traversed if you don't get to the center - so I'll hedge my bets and traverse a some unnecessary cells."

electronics,34l6tl,triffid_hunter,2,Sat May 2 05:22:23 2015 UTC,"To deliver 2 watts into an 8 ohm load, your amplifier will need to produce a sinewave whose peak-to-peak amplitude is 11.3 volts.  Regrettably the amplifier won't be able to swing its output all the way to the supply rails; you'd be lucky if your amp can swing up as high as (Vposrail - 2V) and can swing as low as (Vnegrail + 2V).  So you will need to connect your amplifier to a power supply of at least 15.3 volts (or if you use split rail supplies, at least ±7.7 volts) if you require 2 watts of output into an 8 ohm speaker.  If you elect to use a single ended power supply, your amplifier will be connected to the loudspeaker with an AC coupling capacitor.  The capacitor needs to be at least 1,000 uF (and preferably 3,300 uF) to avoid rolling off the low-frequency response and killing the bass.  If you use split-rail power supplies, you may not need the AC coupling capacitor between amplifier and speaker.  I imagine you might want to investigate the LM380 (ends in zero) IC.  If you use it with a heatsink, you can get 2 watts into an 8 ohm load with a 16V single ended power supply -- see Figure 8 of the datasheet.  Get it in the 14 pin package, the one that has all those GND pins for extra heat transfer.

The result is that the op-amp will open the gates to drive the voltage of the output of the transistors to your signal voltage, but you'll be able to run current straight from the rails through the transistors.  Very simple and cheap, and great for things like this.  Edit I feel compelled to mention, that those transistors will likely be able to supply much more than 2 amps if you let them (ie, a wire on the op-amp gets lose and it rails).

Those tabs that come on the SLAs can be tricky to solder though because they're really thick, but it's been done.  edit 2: SLA batteries should not be stored with a low charge, and will lose their charge over time. This is why people have 'battery tenders' for their motorcycle batteries. Storing it over the winter with a low charge, and not periodically topping up the charge, will wreck the battery.

I'll just throw some examples:  You see how much hand duplication is needed? Suppose you need to systematically change the number of registers of blocks. Easy to parametrize in text form, very hard and annoying in graphical.  The wire mess is already hard to understand with few blocks and well-define data paths. This may hide bugs, or make the relation between blocks harder to understand, specially on bigger projects. Also, text-based hardware description is much more self documenting.  Now, you needed to change something in the design. Separate a single block in two different ones, or a difference in the bus width there. Using a graphic this gets hard to track, specially if the changes occur in different levels (eg, an extra wire connecting to top blocks that interfere with the logic within them), or in several steps. Text-based hardware description makes easier to track changes and to automate analysis."

Then look for an introductory computer architecture book/resource, also at the undergrad level. A few chapters of that should get you doing a basic CPU, a few more will not you some of the ubiquitous performance improvements (pipelining, caching, etc.).   This assumes you already have a digital system design background (combinational and sequential logic), and some RTL and VHDL or Verilog knowledge if you want to make this CPU on an FPGA. If not, those might be things you need to read up on as well. (Quite much easier, though.)   Sorry I don't have any of the books I used in undergrad on hand right now, or I'd reference them.

electronics,34gdh3,ItsFrank11,2,Thu Apr 30 22:39:22 2015 UTC,"If I had to guess, it is a transformer for a stereo receiver (maybe with a digital function), or from a UPS.  If it is from a stereo, the small bundle  are for low current supplies (it would be for a UPS as well). The orange and red pair(with that brown wire) are for the analog/amplifier supply. The heavy orange/white are high current for the finals. The white/black/yellow bundle are AC in, universal for 100 to 240V, depending on how it is wired.  If it is a UPS transformer, the heavy wires are a driven AC in from the battery (from a  MOSFET driver). Orange/brow/red are for charging,or a boost/buck."
electronics,34gdh3,classicsat,1 point,Sat May 2 18:34:46 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply! I ended up wiring the two input lines to mains and taking some measurements, from what I can tell you're pretty spot on, both bundles seem to be center tapped, where the large ones, the two yellows are 30v and the two whites are 60v, i wired it to a simple unregulated bridge rectifier circuit with a 1uF capacitor and i saw no voltage drop until my loads were under 1.5k ohms for the 30v pair, which seems like it can deliver some decent power. My goal is to use it for a variable power supply... Which is probably a waste considering how versatile this thing could be. However, the lower voltage lines could be really useful for some instrumentation"

electronics,34gdh3,ANTALIFE,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:39:58 2015 UTC,"The two heavier gauge wires are most likely 120 VAC input.  Wire it up and probe the outputs with a meter.  Determining current capacity is a bit more difficult.  You can get a ballpark by looking at voltage droop under load.  You really need to look at core and wire heating, though, and be aware that it can take large transformers like this several hours to reach temperature."

These industrious people then put the manufacturer data into Excel and activate the Trendline feature with Equation On Graph.  This shows the best-fit linear equation which relates weight to VArating.  Shockingly the goodness of fit (Rsquared) metric, is damn good. Awful Damn Good.  Which means that if you weigh an unknown transformer, you can estimate its power (VA) rating, shockingly well, just from an Excel plot that you make yourself after 20 minutes of jacking around on a transformer manufacturer's website.

I think some basic accounting packages like quickbooks can do inventory.  Some of us already have the inventory just because.  Why not share and restock at your leisure? it's doubtful you will be bought out of a part swiftly.    Personally I like to browse the stock physically because I spot things I hadn't thought of and buy because I may use it later, OP can grant that access if they like at the risk of losses.    HSC does shelf browsing and does not track stock.

I think what the above posters are trying to emphasize is that any business centered around selling hobby products is going to be a losing business venture.   I agree with them, investigate starting a makerspace. See if you can get your hands on a bunch of second hand work benches, test equipment, and shop tools. Charge people a reasonable monthly rate (I don't think I'd be willing to spend more than $10 honestly). Set up workshops with lesson plans for working with different kinds of technologies (find guest lecturers if you don't have the knowledge, preferably volunteers).

I just looked at this and see in the picture that the manufacturer of the device in the auction appears to have placed a single 0 ohm resistor at 15 degrees to bridge two sets of pads.  They did this in serious violation of PCB assembly standards instead of using a second 0 ohm resistor or simply modifying the PCB.  Now I wonder what those resistor's did in the first place, where they got the PCB gerbers from, and what else they've done to the design to save fractions of a US penny.  I feel super comfortable plugging a device into my PC that didn't want to spend the extra $0.0015 (yes, well under a penny in any volume) to correct this.  /s  I'm not plugging OP's friend's Kickstarter in any way but this particular device looks... dubious at best.

electronics,34btbb,vexstream,3,Wed Apr 29 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's entirely possible that it is as USB 2.0 compliant as anything else.  Technically USB 2.0 says devices are only able to pull 100mA and requires them to then communicate on the bus and request 500mA.  In practice, the ""request"" portion is ignored all the time and devices just pull 500mA any time they want.  So many commercial products do this now that there's really just sort of an understanding in the industry that it's almost always OK to do.  As long as this device draws no more than 500mA (2.5 Watts) from the USB port, the port doesn't ever care what you do with that power.  You could boost it to a higher voltage just as easily as you can regulate it down to a lower one (more common).  The biggest thing to note is this:  Assuming a boost efficiency of 80% (which should be pretty decent approximation) you can only expect to get at most 167mA at 12V or 222mA at 9V.  Now, if you're talking FCC compliance, EMI radiation testing, etc that's impossible to say.  Edit: It looks like I just didn't notice that the creator actually did point out that last bit about current limits in the details.  That's not a lot of power but at least they did the math right!"

Ceramic handle high voltage just fine (it's just a function of plate spacing), but they're more expensive to make and would be stupid expensive in big sizes and lose all the benefits of a ceramic cap if made huge.

The circuit is battery powered, which is good from a safety perspective, but then you plug it into a PC's audio port. A poorly designed PC could easily have harmful voltage noise on the audio port, and a really bad design could conceivably allow mains voltage to sneak through.

electronics,344hy5,joeydoesntsharefood,3,Tue Apr 28 15:46:06 2015 UTC,The brush overheated and melted its mount in the body. Dremels do that all the time. They're garbage. Look into a Proxxon for your next rotary tool.
electronics,344hy5,DelusionalX1,2,Tue Apr 28 17:16:33 2015 UTC,"I've done this to a Dremel too while simply adjusting the speed setting.  I picked up a Craftsman rotary tool, which is working fine so far."
electronics,344hy5,joeydoesntsharefood,3,Tue Apr 28 14:08:42 2015 UTC,I would just solder the bridge that was created when it stalled. I think it's safe to assume if the trace burned then the IC is still probably working. Just close that bridge and give it a try.

electronics,345zfk,chibiace,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:36:33 2015 UTC,"so if the fuse was not faulty then it would have blown.  you'd still have a problem.  however, the problem pay be that you're using a strip.  it's really best to not plug heaters into strips.  a heater can often max out the whole circuit by itself.  if you really need a longer cord, get one rated for MORE than the amps the heater is rated for, and don't coil it.  coiling it will cause the cord to become an induction heater and it'll melt itself."

Their are two other boards that use the RN-52 that are available to the hobbyist market. One is from Sparkfun, however all it is, is a straight breakout of the pins leaving everything else to the end user. The other one is a devolpment board for the module that runs a little north of $100.   If I could make a recommendation, this seems like the kind of thing the people at sparkfun, adafruit or the other hobbyist electronics retailers would be interested in.

I'd never considered a bluetooth audio receiver before (and got super excited) and so I googled it and in less than 5 minutes found this. Why is your device better than currently existing bluetooth receivers for people that don't want to program it, people that just want high quality audio streaming over bluetooth, people that find a comparable product that has a glossy, dust-proof enclosure for $20 less than your kickstarter device with no warranty?  Edit: And let me go on to say that it's obvious you've put a huge amount of work into this, I respect that. My point is to know your market, and if your board is more appealing to the niche programmer DIY junkie, rather than people that just want bluetooth audio streaming, consider gearing the content of your page toward the people that will actually buy this.  Edit 2: What makes your device unique to the group of people you're selling this to? If it has some... I don't know... weird data flowthrough pipeline bullshit that people like me wouldn't know what to do with, it might still be the right thing to do to include that information if people like me wouldn't be buying it in the first place."

The Kickstarter product also only does that out of the box, but it supports AVRCP, so someone with the know-how could build a full media station around it, with volume/track controls, and SPP (Serial Port Profile), so with a bit more know-how, you could, for example, have the source device send track title/artist information to this unit."

The company is listed as ""management consulting services"", which I'm guessing is just boilerplate.   On top of the black box appears to be a battery holder with an LED attached to it- prehaps the batteries were drained quickly during use.   The eveready battery is one something I'd never seen before. It's a model 412 battery, which is 22.5v. They appear to have been used in transistor radios. Here is a listing on ebay..   The sparkplug does not appear to be connected to anything, so I'm just going to ignore it.   The nitrogen in appears to be connected to a big black box with some control leads that go to a knob, and power leads which go to a plug. Given the output is labeled as ""drying air flow"", I'm guessing this is some sort of heater.

It seems like these are still a ways off in being friendly to most common hobbyists, though I hope you can prove this wrong through your project and blog. From my understanding a lot of the power in FPGAs can be in how logic and components can be modeled. Do you think there is ever the possibility of a converter where many components have already been modeled, and can essentially take a schematic of a circuit and code it into a useable firmware (if this is the correct term)?  I hope this isn't a ridiculous question. Just hoping at some point a hardware system and the open source community come together to make this all a bit more accessible to mere mortals like what happened with microprocessors.

electronics,342nb7,roustabout,3,Tue Apr 28 20:53:07 2015 UTC,I've been working with FPGAs for many years and the original design process was exactly as you described. The designs where implemented in schematic format and you wired up the gates and flip-flops to create your design. As the devices got bigger these became more complex and the community began to move towards HDL as the design entry method. The latest version of most vendors tools no longer support schematic capture for design entry. I have heard that there are some developments like 'Scratch' for the Raspberry Pi that are looking to simplify FPGA design but I don't know what level they have achieved. As a hobbyist you may want to start by creating a library of standard 74 series logic and then build simple circuits using these within your initial FPGA designs. This is actually quite simple and I would be happy to write a post explaining how to do this if it was of interest. You then can simply connect up these familiar elements in a top level 'structural' design.

electronics,341ryo,AVLev,5,Mon Apr 27 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"For switching power supplies, you need a LOT more than a simple oscilloscope. Switching power supplies need a differential probe to isolate the scope input from the supply. Without it, you will not only have a hard time visualizing the waveforms but you will also run a HUGE risk of blowing out your supply. It's VERY easy to kill a scope with an SMPS. Most scopes can only tolerate a few hundred volts on the input in 1Mohm mode or 10's of volts in 50ohm mode. These are also ABSOLUTE values, get a bit above them and your scope input dies. Also, the higher the frequency, the lower this acceptable voltage is. So it might be as low as 10's of volts at the highest frequencies.  As for cost, there is a good chance the differential probe will cost just as much, if not more, than your oscilloscope itself. So budget accordingly.   For most scopes, you should be able to get by with any low end analog scope. For digitial scopes, you aren't really in the price range. You might be able to find a cheap scope if you are lucky but the quality is going to be very low. You are much better off getting a decent differential probe and a good analog scope. I do NOT recommend a USB scope for SMPS work, all it takes is a simple short to short your PC directly to high voltages, killing both your scope AND your pc at the same time."
electronics,341ryo,PedroDaGr8,2,Mon Apr 27 17:53:18 2015 UTC,"I don't generally try to probe the primary side of a SMPS, but if I wanted to, I would be inclined to isolate the AC input with a transformer, so I could ground the primary-side common voltage. Is that not more practical than a high voltage differential probe?"
electronics,341ryo,1wiseguy,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:49:22 2015 UTC,Do what is the difference between a differential an a normal probe?  Also is a 20MHz good enough for SMPS analysis?
electronics,341ryo,PedroDaGr8,3,Mon Apr 27 18:53:20 2015 UTC,"A normal probe measures the difference in a signal between the probe tip and the scopes ground (the ground leads on all channels are connected to each other and to the scopes ground). This can result in ALL sorts of issues where you basically bridge points in your circuit at different voltages via ground or bridge them directly to scope ground.  A differential probe, as the name implies, measures the difference in voltage between two points where neither of them has to be at actual ground. It works by isolating both voltages from the scope. In a switching power supply, these differential voltages are very common. Your differential signal might only be 10V, with the signal at 30V and the ""Ground"" at +20V with respect to your scope's ground. Connect the ground clip of your scope to this ""ground"" and kiss your scope and or SMPS goodbye as you basically short 20V to ground THROUGH your scope. Additionally, good differential probes will be rated to higher isolation voltages which allows you to work on higher voltages or in systems with high inductive spikes (which can easily be in the 100s of volts). Additionally, since the probe is differential any noise that is on both channels disappears. This is very common in SMPSs, where you can get waveforms present both on the signal and on ground that are equal. On a regular scope you get a mess to look at, on a differential probe everything is VERY clear.  Yeah, 20Mhz should be good enough for most situations. You should easily be able to see squarewaves up to 20Mhz with almost no rounding. Also, remember that 20MHz is the -3dB point, your scope will read higher but any transients will be attenuated by a certain amount."
electronics,341ryo,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:07:21 2015 UTC,The general rule of thumb is that your scope's bandwidth should be three times the maximum frequency of analog signals and five times the maximum frequency of any digital signals you want to work with.

It is sometimes known as the folding frequency of a sampling system.   An example of folding is depicted in Figure 1, where fs is the sampling rate and 0.5 fs is the corresponding Nyquist frequency.   The black dot plotted at 0.6 fs represents the amplitude and frequency of a sinusoidal function whose frequency is 60% of the sample-rate (fs). The other three dots indicate the frequencies and amplitudes of three other sinusoids that would produce the same set of samples as the actual sinusoid that was sampled. The symmetry about 0.5 fs is referred to as folding.    Image i - Fig 1. The black dots are aliases of each other. The solid red line is an example of adjusting amplitude vs frequency. The dashed red lines are the corresponding paths of the aliases.     Interesting: Nyquist rate | Impulse invariance | Anti-aliasing filter | Aliasing   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

Storage containers categorized by ""loads"", ""batteries"", ""mounting stuff /case parts"", etc.  All the bags get all over each other, and there is no real organization, and sometimes components fall out of baggies that aren't zip lock type and get everywhere.  Then I have a ""currently playing with"" bin that has recently or often used components, no baggies.  But there's a ring magnet in there (which is an experimental inductor to study freq response, saturation, and other effects of using a magnetic core), so besides the scattered everything, there's a massive ball-of-yarn-looking cluster of shit.      The OCD side of me wants to get something like styrofoam blocks or endless freeform breadboards, so I can lay out all thru-hole components vertically, spacing everything out perfectly like lined soldiers.  I think it might also be cool to put everything in small metal suitcases that upon opening, press a mechanical switch that releases pressurized gas and slowly lets up, so that even if I'm just getting a 1k resistor it'd be like PSSSSHHHHAAAAAAAaaaaaaaa...~~~ which would help make every electronics project feel like I'm working on epic breakthroughs (instead of just doing what's already been done a billion times over).

Then you can use your function generator with a 1K series resistor to put a 1000Hz sinewave input across winding #1 with all other windings open-circuit.  Measure the amplitude across winding #1 and also across winding #2.  This will tell you the turns ratio (and the phase dot convention) between winding #1 and winding #2.

electronics,33ydu9,TeaCupOverdose,5,Sun Apr 26 20:35:15 2015 UTC,"the N-Channel MOSFETs drew too much current from the AtMega, causing the chip to reset and keep the motors at full speed. I added a current limiting resistor and the motors never got stuck again.   Generally a bad idea, you're increasing the switching losses by keeping the MOSFET in the linear region for longer while charging and discharging the gate. A better solution would be to use MOSFET drivers to drive the MOSFETs or just to use an off-the-shelf RC motor controller. To be honest, I've never seen a MCU resetting itself when driving oversized capacitive loads, maybe something else is not quite right.  A single ATmega328 should be able to easily do sensor fusion for a compass and GPS and to control the rudder at a decent frequency. I would guess there's some blocking code wasting cycles if it was an issue."

As for the code blocking, I'm not sure that it's possible to run a single AtMega at that same speed that two can run at. The two GPS libraries I tested (TinyGPS and the Adafruit one) take a lot of time (>200ms) to update the location."

With that missing on both sides, you don't have too many options left.  If you can follow the trace back to some other pad on the PCB and solder to it that would be an option but it will require at least moderate soldering skill - depending on where that trace goes.  In the future, I would recommend just soldering in a pin header into those holes.  Only solder wires directly to the holes for some permanent installation.  With a pin header you can connect any length/size wire at any time without de soldering anything.  Edit: It looks like an FM tuner break out board?

You need to use flux. I don't see any flux residue in the pictures. What type of iron are you using?   You can fix this by doing what ""LetMeClearYourThroat"" said. Just follow the trace.

The market is flooded with fakes, to the point that almost all on ebay are fake.  As for power supplies, used will by far give you the best value. As for the type, you need to decide on your needs. Will you need high voltage, dual voltage (+/-), precision, low ripple, PC connection, etc. These will determine which direction you head. Once you know what you need then we can better advise you.   For a multimeter, your options are wide open. If you only have one multimeter, I would go with a higher quality one. You can always use a higher safety rated meter in low voltage, but you can't use a low safety rated meter in high voltage/high current situations. For handhelds, used Fluke's are often, but not always, a good value. For new, Fluke is seldom the best value. Bench meters can also be a very good value for the performance.

Maybe you should try to build your own H bridge.

There is a breakout board for this particular IC though, with two SMD L9110's, and I've seen people run it off of an Arduino, even with much much bigger motors than my really tiny one without any problems. Not quite sure what's the deal with that...  Also, I might be completely wrong here, but I think 1 diode won't do the job, since the coil needs to be able to produce both directions of magnetic field, the diode would only protect from 1 direction and not the other. Adding another one parallel, but in reversed with the first diode would be a solution here?"

electronics,33ti88,fastbiter,9,Sat Apr 25 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"Series and buck. If you look at virtually any commercial product, you'll find series and buck. Here's why:  Parallel batteries will also discharge into the one with the highest leakage/self-discharge. So even standing idle it's possible to find a device with dead batteries.  When you use parallel and boost, to get to the same output wattage as serial and buck, the converter has to draw more current, which increases I2 R losses (and note it's current squared, so that's not exactly the idea thing to increase.) Higher current also means the components have to be rated higher as well. In the end, boost convertors are always going to be less efficient than buck -- when you find the situation reversed, it's usually a sign you need to find a better buck controller IC.  The current issue with a parallel implementation gets worse as the batteries are depleted, where a series implementation will have even near-depleted batteries running efficiently.  There are times where a boost configuration makes sense, but it's almost universally situations where you're using a single cell to power the device, and that the load that needs the boost has a low duty cycle. Nearly all other times series-buck is more efficient and cheaper as well."
electronics,33ti88,1991_VG,1 point,Sat Apr 25 17:52:09 2015 UTC,"You sound knowledgeable, so I hope you don't mind if I hit you with a question.    I have a portable inverter box, which came to me with a dead lead-acid (e: 12v SLA) battery (since recycled). I also have about 50 USB battery packs with defective circuitry (mostly the USB output or display).    What's the best way to combine a whole bunch of lithium ion packs into something that approximates a lead-acid battery? I took one of the batteries apart; it's some Chinese cell (which might actually be two 5500 mAh cells wired in parallel and packaged together, though I'm not sure) that's rated for 6 amps discharge."
electronics,33ti88,atomicthumbs,1 point,Sun Apr 26 03:38:57 2015 UTC,"Generally, this sounds like a bad idea, mostly because it's unclear how the charging system of the inverter works, and if the current draw is appropriate. If it has a built-in charger, it's completely incompatible with using any lithium solution that isn't designed as a self-contained replacement for lead-acid batteries (such batteries contain their own charger and protection circuitry.)  That said:  The portable inverter was likely using a 12 volt sealed lead-acid battery, which typically has an operating voltage range of 13.8 to 11.0V. Lithium cells run from 3.0 to 4.2 volts per cell, so you'd need 3 or 4 cells in series, probably 3 to be safe -- but they would drop to below 11V about halfway  through the discharge process.  Not knowing the rating of the inverter, it's hard to say if the current from the cells would be appropriate. 6 amps at 12V is ~72 watts, less losses, and your 5500 mAh cell would be depleted in a short amount of time. Running a bunch of lithium cells in series and parallel to get both the right voltage and amperage would technically work, but doing so without the correct monitoring, balance management and charge circuitry is asking for a bad time, potentially the flaming lithium battery meltdown kind of bad time."

You can even safely recharge both in parallel at once with a single charge manager.

Like, without destroying the part from too much heat or pennies falling off because you just heated the thing to solder melting temperature.  My favorite heatsink - works for TO-220, those flat bridge rectifiers, tallish opto-triacs.  Pretty versatile because the plane where the part attaches is flat even with those fins to the side.  I've even mounted one on the outside of a steel box with the part on the inside of the box (a lot of steel is actually pretty piss poor at conducting heat).  Maybe not the best for something that can be handled, but for a box that's put in something and left, it worked alright."

If they are not, is a rewind job. As you unwind the wires you will have to count the number of turns ACCURATELY (not as easy as it sounds). Then you have to get new wire( match the thickness and type) and rewind the exact number of turns. It took me about 4 hours for my first one.   It would be best to work out the supply voltage from the winding ratio and go buy one.  Consider that transformer almost NEVER dies.

In your other comment you said something like ""try an iPad with software first,"" and the current practice when assessing if someone needs assistive technology is to go from simple to more complex, as needed. So it's a case by case basis and the more options the better to suit an individual's needs. That being said the iPad and related communication apps are pretty revolutionary when you consider how much some of this assistive technology costs, and how you used to need to have a bunch of different devices.

electronics,33isxu,thebutcherer,8,Thu Apr 23 01:26:13 2015 UTC,"This particular FPGA board is the LX9 variant, which they sell for about $75 plus shipping. The LEDs will indeed run you about $30 at a minimum. So yeah, not a horribly expensive project, but not exactly cheap either.  If were to spin my own board in ""kickstarter quantities"", I would look at including a Series 7 FPGA that can do 1080p. It should be about $20-30 more expensive than the LX9 used in the miniSpartan6 ($35ish instead of $15ish). However, you wouldn't need to include a bunch of the components currently on the miniSpartan6, so I'm optimistic the costs could remain under $100. You could also integrate the level shifting circuit directly on the board, with an appropriate connector for the LED strand in question.  All in all, I think a ""productized"" version could go for about $150 on kickstarter including LED strand. I have no plans for such an undertaking.  However, all designs are open source, so if you feel up to it, go ahead!"

The funny thing about XOR-based stream cyphers is that the ""encrypt"" and ""decrypt"" functions are exactly the same.  Plaintext goes in and cyphertext comes out, or vice versa.

electronics,33isxu,missblit,4,Fri Apr 24 12:25:00 2015 UTC,A couple of thoughts:  Why go to the trouble of re-encoding when you could just buffer the original  incoming stream?  What about EDID? Some devices might need it to output the correct resolution.
electronics,33isxu,scubascratch,2,Thu Apr 23 02:41:44 2015 UTC,"EDID is actually crazy easy, at least on the Atlys (no experience with the board in the post) and if your HDMI source isn't too picky.  You can grab HDMI2USB's EDID code (edidslave.v), plop in your own EDID file, and away you go.  I've found the above EDID code doesn't play super nice with a Linux intel source, but it seemed to work perfectly on Windows-- so not sure what was going wrong.  And that's if you need to generate your own EDID. Doing EDID passthrough should be even easier (I think you'd just need to passthrough the SCL and SDA signals)"
electronics,33isxu,scubascratch,2,Thu Apr 23 03:47:37 2015 UTC,"Bunnie Huang's NeTV does what he refers to as ""EDID Squashing"". What this basically means is that the FPGA screens the modes the HDMI sink advertises and removes all the modes that are not supported by the NeTV. What is left are modes supported both by the NeTV and the display, and therefore supposed to work.  This is not a huge amount of work, and I could probably repurpose most of Bunnie's code, since the internal operation of the NeTV is very similar to neppielights. I just decided not to bother with it, but an enterprising person could certainly contribute a PR :P"
electronics,33isxu,threecasks,2,Thu Apr 23 08:01:35 2015 UTC,"The idea of EDID squashing sounds really cool.  My project didn't have an actual monitor on the other side, so we didn't even think of passthrough and just generated a 640x480 EDID by hand and used the code I linked above. As a software person it kinda blows me away how fast the clock rates here are even for tiny resolutions  Another thing to note is that you can sometimes get away without any EDID at all-- for example if your HDMI source is managed by Linux's DRM driver you can supply your own EDID at the linux side upon boot-up. I had to do this because our project kept uh... segfaulting (!) KDE's monitor configuration dialog."

electronics,33isxu,gmarsh23,6,Thu Apr 23 11:21:57 2015 UTC,"This is pretty nice work.  Can I suggest that instead of using averaging of rgb values, that you instead convert the pixel data to an HSV representation, only need like 256 total HSV buckets (say 4 bits for Hue, 2 for Sat, 2 for Luma), then use histogram method for determining the ""dominant"" color.  I recommend this because the RGB averaging method usually leads to shades of brown and grey for the majority of real-world imagery."

electronics,33la1j,easlern,2,Thu Apr 23 13:14:07 2015 UTC,"The simplest and cheapest way to do this is to power your circuit with a capacitor.  Then, measure how much time it takes for the capacitor voltage to drop 0.1V.  From this you can calculate power consumption.    You want to size your capacitor such that you will have a good number of sleep/wake cycles within that 0.1V delta voltage.  You will also need to measure the actual value of your capacitor for good accuracy.  If you do this properly your measurement results will be quite good."
electronics,33la1j,FullFrontalNoodly,4,Thu Apr 23 13:32:43 2015 UTC,"And you also need to calibrate the leakage of the capacitor itself.  If you seek to measure nanoamps then you don't want a capacitor that leaks microamps!  The easiest way to do this is with some 1% load resistors: 1Megohm, 3.3Megohms, 10Megohms, 33Megohms, etc.   Use your measurement apparatus to ""measure"" the power consumption of these known loads.  Use Excel to make a scatterplot of (measurement results from your apparatus) versus (known right answers from Ohm's Law).  Perform a linear regression, known as Trendline in Excel, and plot the equation on the graph with numbers in Scientific notation + 5 digits.  From the slope and intercept of the regression line, extract the capacitor leakage.  Boom, done."
electronics,33la1j,fatangaboo,2,Thu Apr 23 15:33:17 2015 UTC,"Good catch.  I probably should have mentioned this.  I was making the assumption that when using a small capacitor for short run times (1) that capacitor is generally going to have a lower leakage value and (2) due to the short duration leakage will have less of an effect on data.  If you want good accuracy you are going to want to start with a low-leakage capacitor to begin with.  Polypropylene film capacitors would be a good choice here.  To further complicate things, you also need to be aware that leakage is non-linear.  You will see a ""substantial"" drop for a short period after the capacitor is charged after which time the leakage will stabilize to a more constant value.  If you use a good PP cap, wait wait a few minutes after charging to initiate your test, and keep your tests relatively short, you can generally get quite accurate results without having to factor in leakage.  OTOH, if you are using an electrolytic cap you will most definitely want to factor in leakage."
electronics,33la1j,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:09:39 2015 UTC,"Problem with bigger value caps (and electrolytics in first line) is not only leakage, but also ""soakage"" is present. Meaning not only it will discharge by itself - but when forcefully discharged to nill, after disconnecting the load, it will charge up by some amount in some time. This is due to physics going on in dielectric material involved. From EE point of view, it can be approximated by a parallel combo of several series RC (small caps with super-high ESR) additional to the real capactitor model involved. You can possibly calibrate this out, but those parameters take long to characterise and will drift with ambient conditions and time."
electronics,33la1j,E_kony,1 point,Thu Apr 23 20:07:45 2015 UTC,This sounds cool although it's a little outside my experience. To use the capacitor- could I just hold the two ends on a battery for the appropriate amount of time and measure the voltage so I can compare it after putting it in the circuit for X seconds? Would that be sufficient or too crude to get good results?  As far as measuring capacitance- that is definitely outside my experience. Not sure how to go about doing that. Is there a similar trick for figuring out that one?
electronics,33la1j,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Thu Apr 23 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, you can charge the capacitor from any voltage source.  One of your CR2032 batteries would work just fine.  To measure capacitance, charge the capacitor, measure it's voltage, place it across a resistor of known (measured) value, then measure time and voltage at another point.  From this you can calculate the value or the capacitor to the same degree of precision as your multimeter and stopwatch.  This is actually the preferred way to measure the value of your capacitor in this case, as capacitance can change (often significantly) with voltage.  Edit: Thanks for the gold!"

Depends on order of magnitude we are talking about, but stuff like surface leakage of the PCB on which the intergator sits, triboelectric effects of cabling, thermal offsets, ... Also for longer times - no reason for doing it solely analog way - you can read out and reset integrator at some fixed period and add up the charge later numerically, to get rid of acumulated noise, drift and so on.   So - really depends on what you are after. Might range from cleaning flux residues and other shit sticked to PCB to active shielding and such things.  Just to illustrate precision achievable by this cocept - ever heard of double or multislope integrating converters? Ever wondered what is the ADC they use in 6,5 - 8,5 digit DMMs :) ?"

Bonus point is you can hook it up to o'scope and see the actual consumption in time. If consumed energy still needed to be known (not only current), you can integrate area under the plot directly on digital o'scope, if you happen to have one.   Bandwidth, feedback resistor value and choice of opamp for the TIA has direct effect on noise performance.  With clever use of comparator and FET, you can easilly eliminate the burden voltage of this setup in case it goes into saturation (ie. normal operation with mA currents). Yet again it still remains as simple 1 - 2 opamp solution that can be bodged together in >20 minutes."
electronics,33la1j,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Thu Apr 23 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"There are a few factors that could skew the results.

In its most common application, two signals at frequencies f1 and f2 are applied to a mixer, and it produces new signals at the sum f1 + f2 and difference f1 - f2 of the original frequencies, called heterodynes. Other frequency components may also be produced in a practical frequency mixer.  Mixers are widely used to shift signals from one frequency range to another, a process known as heterodyning, for convenience in transmission or further signal processing. For example, a key component of a superheterodyne receiver is a mixer used to move received signals to a common intermediate frequency.

electronics,33k9wl,reg8392748,2,Thu Apr 23 05:12:09 2015 UTC,"In theory, it will depend on his local laws and/or treaties his country is a signatory to. The exporter may be violating US laws, but obviously if he's not a resident then enforcement becomes a bit of an issue.  In practice, it's up to customs to stop this sort of thing. There are plenty of non-type-certified goods that make it into the US. The use of such occasionally resulting in pretty severe enforcement actions."
electronics,33k9wl,1991_VG,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:14:45 2015 UTC,"But which FCC rule actually prohibits exporters from marketing unapproved goods? I see rules banning importing into and exporting from the US, but not exporting into the US."
electronics,33k9wl,1991_VG,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:52:50 2015 UTC,"OK, both importation and marketing are governed by the OET's  equipment authorization program, and that's covered by 47 CFR Part 2 See page 20 of the presentation and get ready to dig into the CFRs if you really want the citation authorizing this.  Basically the equipment authorization program bans the sale or marketing of unapproved equipment. If you look at ads for things like new ham radio equipment, you'll actually see disclosures about the radio not being type accepted yet, so the ads is for information purposes only. That disclosure is there because they'd be in violation of the EA rule otherwise."
electronics,33k9wl,FullFrontalNoodly,2,Thu Apr 23 22:20:38 2015 UTC,That depends on what you are asking.  Can a foreign entity be forced to stand trial in an American court for shipping a non-approved device?  Probably not.  Can the items be confiscated and destroyed by US customs?  Absolutely.
electronics,33k9wl,FullFrontalNoodly,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:48:25 2015 UTC,"Is shipping non-approved devices actually illegal though? The rules ban importing into the US, but doesn't seem to talk about exporting to the US."
electronics,33k9wl,twentyfirstsummer,1 point,Thu Apr 23 21:54:22 2015 UTC,"I don't believe the US can prosecute a foreign company shipping to the US.  I believe they can prosecute a US company if they can prove intent to sell.  If this is not just a hypothetical question, you should consult a lawyer."
