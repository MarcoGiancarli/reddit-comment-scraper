AKB48,3dsz3u,RinaLuvsPandas,3,Sun Jul 19 04:00:51 2015 UTC,Three tiebreakers! I need votes and everything has been extended by one day! I kind of regret that but oh well. (I'm tired of votes.. I see numbers now..) The girls here are fighting for rank 21 to around rank 5. Good luck and have fun.   We're almost done!!!
AKB48,3dsz3u,sonnybun,3,Sun Jul 19 15:32:06 2015 UTC,Count Dracotaka. That may have been a really bad Sesame Street pun...
AKB48,3dsz3u,Mechabolt,2,Mon Jul 20 04:47:02 2015 UTC,Just wanna say thanks for doing this! I'm not that active here but this is a fun and interesting way to see who are the more popular members here. Can't wait for the final results!

AKB48,3dl5rj,tig3rlili,2,Fri Jul 17 03:58:52 2015 UTC,Its interesting that they keep pushing Paruru.I'd think that they at least have a different member take the lead.
AKB48,3dl5rj,LuvList,3,Fri Jul 17 04:37:01 2015 UTC,"Well, it's a sequel taking place after MJSK4, and from the story it looks like Sakura and Paruru are still the lead characters of the Majisuka faction, so there should be no surprise there. The only major casting additions are that of Megu, Mariyagi and Tomu from the new school."
AKB48,3dl5rj,dnagi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:26:36 2015 UTC,"Ah that makes sense.Still i much prefer a new storyline,just to keep things fresh. Tomu though <3"
AKB48,3dl5rj,LuvList,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:51:25 2015 UTC,"It's not solely for pushing, though. They also want to make money.  Paruru is in that sweet spot where she's very popular, but not so much that her schedule will hurt too much from drama filming. She also has acting experience."
AKB48,3dl5rj,GentlemanlyOctopus,2,Fri Jul 17 17:18:08 2015 UTC,"Oh i totally understand why,its just that i expected to see different girl thats relatively popular this time,especially with 12th gen and up.  Paruru is in front of Majisuka for 3 seasons now.They took a chance on her in season 3,and Sakura with season 4.Its a little strange that they didnt follow up with their formula for season 5."
AKB48,3dl5rj,LuvList,2,Fri Jul 17 21:33:34 2015 UTC,"I think this season is going to be a lot more half-assed than previous seasons. For one, it is coming out really soon after 4. The other big thing is that only the first two episodes are going to air on TV. All episodes after that will be Hulu-limited. It seems like it's all sort of a big promotional advertising campaign for Hulu in Japan. Not a good sign for the show itself in my opinion."
AKB48,3dl5rj,effectivecatch,2,Fri Jul 17 12:17:47 2015 UTC,Wow. A storyline featuring the girls and the yakuza.   I really am curious to see what Jurina/Center's role in this and I'm hoping to see more SayaMilky fight scenes. :c
AKB48,3dl5rj,hachiagejo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:49:02 2015 UTC,"Is this another ""Previous season didn't happen"" situation? Center, and I believe Otabe and Salt have graduated now, so it's not a sequel. And Sakura transferred this past year, so it's not a prequel.  Or maybe I care about it too much...  That Haruppi gap, though <3"
AKB48,3dl5rj,GentlemanlyOctopus,2,Fri Jul 17 04:52:31 2015 UTC,"The story part on the main Japanese site says that it takes place months after MJSK4, with involvement of the Mafia, Yakuza, Police force and a new school."
AKB48,3dl5rj,dnagi,2,Fri Jul 17 06:13:44 2015 UTC,I hope it's not as half-assed as MG2 with Acchan eating cherry blossoms every time she was on screen.
AKB48,3dl5rj,GentlemanlyOctopus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:21:16 2015 UTC,Here's the cast list  Here's the trailer  I don't really get what's happening but okay I'm cool with this. Hype.

AKB48,3daewi,yumi113,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:18:33 2015 UTC,What did I just see?
AKB48,3cz4bx,G-METAL,8,Sun Jul 12 02:29:12 2015 UTC,"They're not ""innocent"" so much as ""pure."" Idols in the 48group are generally portrayed as the ""ideal girl."" They wear minimal, clean makeup, to emphasize the girl-next-door natural-beauty look. They can be sexy, wearing skimpy clothing or even nothing in photo shoots, but they're not allowed to date in real life, so fans can project their fantasies onto them. It's all about selling a fantasy: perfect dream girls who belong to their fans.  Everyone tends to have an opinion about this, but since it's not relevant to your question, I'll refrain from discussing mine."
AKB48,3cz4bx,violeblanche,6,Sun Jul 12 08:07:57 2015 UTC,"It's not that they sell themselves as innocent then portray themselves to be something else with their songs or MVs because mind you - they are just songs people write for them and music videos created for them - the art and interpretation does not directly come from the girls. It's all fanservice to sell a product and they all have to act different for each song. For example, they have Sakura no hanabiratachi, but then they have Heavy Rotation - which is the true AKB48? ""Innocent"" or ""sexy?"" I say none, because AKB is made up of hundreds of girls with their own personalities. For each individual girl their character is different (some girls have ""sweet"" characters or some are ""salty"" while some pull off ""sexy""), but most of all they have to keep a ""clean"" (not ""innocent,"" mind you) image because, in the end, they are idols."
AKB48,3cz4bx,hohumne,3,Sun Jul 12 05:47:51 2015 UTC,"fan service?  I don't know honestly. Not really sure if they actively advertise themselves as innocent or it's a cultural thing. An example, if you look up the music videos for Manatsu No Sounds Good for JKT48 the girls there don't wear bikinis compared to the AKB48/SNH48 versions."
AKB48,3cz4bx,PhantasyHero22,2,Sun Jul 12 03:27:21 2015 UTC,"Showing too much skin is still a bit taboo in Indonesia though,its still a country with massive muslim populations.It probably wont even be allowed,let alone sell well."
AKB48,3cz4bx,Mechabolt,0,Sun Jul 12 04:29:35 2015 UTC,"i understand the fan service but they sell themselves to be innocent girls they should do fanservice with that , I also think japanese are way too obsesed with innocent"
AKB48,3cz4bx,N9neZer0,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:48:12 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, management knows what will sell I guess. Judging by YouTube views alone it certainly works! It's interesting to think about the cultural differences, I'm from the US and the ""innocent"" image these days seems pretty rare!"
AKB48,3cz4bx,jsusk24,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:23:49 2015 UTC,"It is not about being innocent, its about being pure. But the meaning of pure is different from western culture. In western culture the nude body is a taboo, but if you think about there's nothing wrong with the human body. An idol is pure in the sense that she can show his body without any bad implication.  I will recommend you this article http://www.wota.tv/el-concepto-de-pureza-japones-porque-si-una-idol-debe-ser-pura-posa-en-bikini-y-photobooks/ is in spanish sorry for english speakers."

The Halloween costume and theme seems a little odd this early,but there's probably reasons behind it.  All in all they've been releasing good products so far,i dont see why this one will be any different.Even the costumes could be changed to something better down the line or in the MV.People will most likely watch the MV once or twice here and there and ends up listen to the actual song anyway.

Maybe Sashihara is a Halloween maniac and really wanted to do this?  Or are they just putting this out hoping that it'll gain traction and be huge enough come October that it'll be played at all the Halloween events this year? That's pretty cynical.  The past two sosenkyo singles had a really good ""Summer single"" feel to them, which I'm not sure is possible with a song about Halloween.  So weird...  I thought it was funny how bad some of the costumes were, though. Poor Kaotan looked like a weird handicapped mummy. Must be difficult to try to look cute in some of those costumes."

AKB48,3c208p,ObsidianWota,2,Fri Jul 10 13:59:25 2015 UTC,Local Time Zone link for the prelim votes final day  Edit:Fixed the time link.
AKB48,3c208p,LuvList,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:17:24 2015 UTC,"1200 WAO! I didn't even know that 12:00 AM JST is considered to be noon. I'm gonna assume major western thoughts, which currently includes myself, share a strong understanding that 12:00 AM is generally referred to as midnight.  ""12:00 AM = 00:00 = Midnight"" is not universal.    12:00 AM JST is 日本 Noon."
AKB48,3c208p,ObsidianWota,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:00:17 2015 UTC,Oh so its July 11th 12:00 noon? i'll change the event link then if it is.
AKB48,3c208p,LuvList,2,Fri Jul 10 17:21:50 2015 UTC,"As I did the stupid thing and read up on 12-hour clocks and read through and down to the stupid confusion of it all - I went ahead and thought to share a discovery without propr notations.  As it is, the link points to a 12:00/Midnight UTC time and not JST. Whether or not its actually 12:00AM Midnight and not Noon - should be an easy fix.  My sincerest apologies with this horrible brain worm.   If its Midnight of July 11, 2015 JST - You may have to rework the time end of July 11th 2015 23:59:59 JST  If its the Noon by July 11th, 2015 Japan legal convention, set it to a time end of July 11th, 2015 11:59:59 JST.   (actually, I lost my previous response when I tested the link during the draft and this is far simpler than previous iterations.)"
AKB48,3c208p,LuvList,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:51:43 2015 UTC,"Oh whoops, I can see there is confusion here. I mean midnight and not noon. So by the time July 12 rolls around (12:01 AM or 00:01), voting is closed. That's my fault. Sorry /u/ObsidianWota and /u/LuvList! Hopefully I didn't confuse myself in the process lol."
AKB48,3c208p,Listia,2,Fri Jul 10 19:00:08 2015 UTC,"Ok i think i fixed my link.I was confused if it was July 11th midnight or July 12th midnight.Cause the former has passed. Just to make sure,by the time i wrote this,there is 20 hours left for the prelim votes to count?"

AKB48,3c208p,Listia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:28:59 2015 UTC,Yes you can save votes until after the preliminary results have shown up. :) Then you have to vote every day.

AKB48,3c0lvy,Axe_Smash,2,Fri Jul 3 17:58:14 2015 UTC,My heart was not prepared to see Yukko. Gosh I miss her.
AKB48,3c0lvy,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Fri Jul 3 23:07:29 2015 UTC,Right? She was my SKE oshi... So damn pretty!
AKB48,3c0lvy,TakeoRey,2,Sun Jul 5 01:25:56 2015 UTC,That was one of the coolest things I've ever seen. Wasn't expecting such stone-cold badassery from a 48 group.
AKB48,3c0lvy,violeblanche,2,Wed Jul 8 08:18:49 2015 UTC,"SKE has great dances! Might not be this type of dance,but you should totally check them out"
AKB48,3c0lvy,Listia,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:31:35 2015 UTC,"Haha I know! Their stuff usually has kind of a different tone, that's why I was surprised by this."
AKB48,3byx3s,TokyoTaro,9,Fri Jul 3 07:47:20 2015 UTC,Here's a partial translation from a different source. It includes a hilarious self-deprecating retort from Kaotan and an actual picture of when she was a hostess.
AKB48,3byx3s,gtazn,10,Fri Jul 3 08:51:49 2015 UTC,"Kao tan!!! I think she is great, and I love almost everything she does. I don't think any of her fans are surprised about this at all, and it's not that big of a deal. She's definitely got that type of personality, and she's never really had a squeaky clean image.  She's one of my favorite members because of her crazy frankness. From what I understand, she's got a pretty wild fanbase, too. Just see her senbatsu placement. For some reason, she inspires fans to go insane and support her like crazy (especially in a monetary sense). That's definitely a hostess-like attribute."
AKB48,3byx3s,effectivecatch,3,Fri Jul 3 10:48:30 2015 UTC,Kaotan was never one to have a clean idol image anyway. Her personality is too blunt and out there and she is always willing to say the truth about the situation at hand. I really like her because of it.
AKB48,3bz517,blueiron0,4,Fri Jul 3 09:26:30 2015 UTC,"From left to right, Furukawa Airi, Takayanagi Akane, and Nakanishi Yuka. Airin and Yuka both graduated this year from SKE48 around March I think. They were so awesome and I miss them, but I'm glad to see Churi get into the Senbatsu this year."
AKB48,3bz517,sonnybun,9,Fri Jul 3 10:28:05 2015 UTC,"Churi was so overdue for Senbatsu,she's such a huge part of SKE."

AKB48,3byftf,PhysPhD,2,Fri Jul 3 04:42:09 2015 UTC,Welcome to Sapporo!
AKB48,3bs5l4,Axe_Smash,5,Wed Jul 1 18:36:11 2015 UTC,They also appeared at an SKE concert a few years ago doing Darkness.
AKB48,3bs5l4,TakeoRey,2,Thu Jul 2 02:20:49 2015 UTC,"Whoa that was awesome. Interesting choreography with one of my favorite songs. They also look like typical businessmen, but with sweet moves on their resume."
AKB48,3bs5l4,sonnybun,2,Thu Jul 2 07:44:17 2015 UTC,Other then this being completely badass (and a tad bit annoyed that they didn't get better dancers.) Does anyone know why Jurina wears an eye patch sometimes?
AKB48,3bs5l4,RinaLuvsPandas,6,Wed Jul 1 23:10:44 2015 UTC,She has a history of overexerting herself and working through injuries and in late 2013 she went through an eye injury/infection (I don't really remember the cause) and wore eyepatches and eyeglasses. It was a cool look but the eyepatch actually went against her doctor's advice and ended up making everything worse.
AKB48,3bs5l4,drzowuss,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:58:57 2015 UTC,Oh my... I'm glad everything is okay now...

AKB48,3br766,rapmemester,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:43:50 2015 UTC,I don't follow SNH closely but I gotta ask- why do the votes go down to .1?
AKB48,3br766,dnagi,2,Wed Jul 1 16:35:09 2015 UTC,They have an additional voting system where people can vote from their phones when they scan a code for the girl. Each of the phone votes count as 0.1.  Some of the girls go out and advertise themselves to get more votes by doing some odd jobs. Here's a video of one.
AKB48,3br766,dnagi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:46:15 2015 UTC,That's a pretty interesting way to vote. Thanks for the info
AKB48,3br766,Parururun,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:08:29 2015 UTC,Yea Baifaka! I hope she stays there or goes up even I would love to see her center a single

AKB48,3bmotc,MalusRegis,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:05:28 2015 UTC,I think they're against a pro team here? Didn't seem to fare too bad.Pretty interesting to find gamers in the group though!
AKB48,3bmotc,LuvList,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"Not quite sure who exactly they were playing with, but yea there are a couple of girls who are into gaming.   Wang Shu referenced Annie's bear Tibbers during her general election video which is also why she played Annie top lane."
AKB48,3bmotc,LuvList,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:44:54 2015 UTC,"Oh thats nice! I admit that first pick Annie was so out of place,but the rest of the pick was fine.  I should try and follow more SNH group,sad i dont speak chinese."
AKB48,3bmotc,thousandmeteors,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:58:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, they are against pro players coming from various different teams. I don't follow the female scene in gaming, but I do know a bit about the male scene. The girl who's name starts with OMGirl comes from a famous club called OMG, which also has a male team constantly ranking as one of the top worldwide for years now.  As expected from an exhibition game though, it was mostly just messing around. The game went for 35 minutes, the pro players could have ended it in a third of that time if they wanted to. Was just for show to keep fans happy."
AKB48,3bmotc,zevz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:20:20 2015 UTC,You know esports has made it when even idol groups are doing it.

AKB48,3biddn,machyna,4,Mon Jun 29 17:25:17 2015 UTC,as a lurker I'm excited to have a way to contribute to the subreddit. I think this is a really cool and fun idea
AKB48,3biddn,maachun48,5,Mon Jun 29 21:17:39 2015 UTC,"As a moderator of /r/AKB48 , I'm always trying to find ways to make this subreddit more fun and immersive.   So this may be a little tangential, and I think this is a step in the right direction, but this isnt something that will make me want to come here.   As a fellow moderator of both /r/BABYMETAL and /r/SakuraGakuin, im always a little disappointed with the level of activity this subreddit gets. Not only are the *48 groups the thing that originally got me into jpop a few years ago, they are the dominating act in their market. Yet looking at this subreddit you would barely know they were active, compared to BABYMETAL which now has 3 times the subscriber base and even SakuraGakuin which is relatively unknown has 70% of here and probably triple the traffic.   Im not saying these for any sort of competition, but shouldnt one of the flagship groups have a little more than half a dozen posts a week? I dont know if this is because most fans use other boards, but why are their subbed shows posted in /r/JapaneseGameShows and not here, why are there no weekly theatre videos and discussions.   Im starting to get a little ""ranty"" so ill leave it at that, but i would love if this place was more lively and hopefully whoever read this far can help offer some suggestions."
AKB48,3biddn,BurntJoint,3,Tue Jun 30 01:16:01 2015 UTC,"I think a big factor that contributes to this subreddit not being that lively a discussion place for the 48G fandom is that there is already a very large discussion forum that dominates in the international 48G fandom.  A big chunk of the fandom, the native Japanese fans, have their own discussion places in Japanese.  As for the international fans, it might just be easier for one to dive into Stage48 rather than try to build up this place which is way smaller.  For content, rather than discussion, Tumblr/the girls' G+, and their Twitter is a direct source.  Hence while I would like to see r/akb48 get a big bigger and more lively, it's a very uphill battle for this subreddit."
AKB48,3biddn,darksteel2291,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:15:17 2015 UTC,"This is true,lots of the information gets posted in stage48 in each girl's thread even the smallest thing sometimes.And there's also few other places to read the news articles online for international fans."
AKB48,3biddn,LuvList,2,Tue Jun 30 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"Don't feel bad about having an opinion. I understand where you're coming from! :) Apart from the regular mod duties, more times than not, my job is coding the sub and keeping the events up-to-date. We do not really have a restrictive sub or approval process for posts; this allows users to post whatever they feel comfortable with within reason of the rules... but it doesn't mean that they will. And I'm okay with that!  A lot of our members frequent forums such as Stage48 and go straight to the source for information (G+ and Twitter). I can't blame them for it; building a community is hard work and these places already have a supportive network for years to fall back on. While I'd love to have more subscribers, I understand where the importance of our sub lies.  My purpose for the SSK isn't to make people come here, but to allow those who already frequent this sub to participate in something they might have a bit of fun with. That's the most I can do within my reign of powers anyways!   I'd love to hear a few suggestions if you think it'd help. :)"
AKB48,3biddn,LuvList,1 point,Tue Jun 30 01:45:10 2015 UTC,"/r/Babymetal is great! Lots of info and news coming out of there.Keep up the good work!  I think Metal fans are much broader and more worldwide than idol fans? They are definitely more accepting from the looks of the live concert Babymetal did.Also it definitely helps that the music they're pumping out is really really unique and well done(not saying akb has meh song or anything).  Like the other poster said,there's way bigger places to find yourself information about the girls than this subreddit.Most are in Japanese though and only gets posted in stage48 forum from fans translation.  One other thing i could think of is that lots of people gets less interested in AKB group in general after the girls they like graduated.As a new fan myself,i love the girls now,but i truly believe the heyday of AKB is few years back when Yuko was hugely active in it.Right now some of the newer girls seems less interesting than the older generations,or there's not enough info out there for me to know more about them.  I agree with you though,hopefully things turned around and this sub get more activity."
AKB48,3biddn,LuvList,2,Tue Jun 30 05:32:21 2015 UTC,"STAGE 2: Theme Selection!   What is stage two about?   Stage 2 will consist of finding the perfect ""phrase"" for our single and ""theme"" suggestions.    What is the phrase selection about?   While we do not have a new song coming out, we will have a new banner instead. This banner will feature our lovely chosen ladies. The phrase we chose will be used to make our sidebar/main banner photo.   What is the theme selection about?   The theme selection is where we will decide what colors should be used for our banner itself. The new subreddit style will be very neutral and will not have color like it does now so that the banner can stand out.   When does the theme selection stage begin?   Right after our voting session is over!"
AKB48,3biddn,BookFan19,2,Mon Jun 29 14:41:01 2015 UTC,"STAGE 3: Theme Implementation!   After stage two is over, what happens next?   I will be testing everything the new subreddit! It will take a bit longer to get everything together but rest assured that everyone will get to approve on the banner before we implement it to the sub.   Which photos will be used for the banner?   Whenever we find out who our girls are, I will open a suggestion thread in which will ask users what their favorite images of the chosen girls are. I'll choose a selection of photos from there and work from that!   What does the new subreddit theme look like?   As of right now, a blank slate. I won't know until we get closer to this stage!"
AKB48,3biddn,MalusRegis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:44:18 2015 UTC,"Quick question.If there's no reply from the mod that means the vote failed,correct?"
AKB48,3biddn,MalusRegis,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:20:49 2015 UTC,"Correct. If there is not a reply, the vote has not been counted yet. Although /u/AKB48_MOD is run by me so the bot should be able to reply as soon as possible to validate your votes. :)"

AKB48,3biddn,minecraruba,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:49:31 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty cool! Just one small question though. Would it be possible to have some type of analysis of the votes, like the S48 SSK Exit Poll Results? Along with the number of votes for each member, I think it would be interesting to know some things like how many people (not giving names, of course) voted for that member or maybe even have just a general participant list.  Either way, I'm looking forward to it!"

AKB48,3biddn,LuvList,2,Thu Jul 2 02:16:32 2015 UTC,"Good question! I would like to get 3 votes each day because our sub is quite small. Prelim results will come out maybe 5-7 days after the voting process has begun.   Edit: Updating this post! I will allow holding votes until preliminary results come out. But after that, you have to vote every day and it cannot be accumulated and used the very last day. This allows it a bit more realistic in a sense that not everyone is able to get votes in on time due to constraints etc."

She said she was really excited to show herself in a bikini, and that the tension was really high because it was a concert."

It's still in the works (in my head) and not finalized but I'd love to hear some suggestions.  I'm debating whether or not we would have our own /r/AKB48 SSK. I was thinking of having the top 7 (or maybe less considering how active our community is) who are chosen to be on the new AKB banner. With that being said, after the girls are chosen, we are to decide what our ""AKB single"" would be. The ""theme"" chosen will be used to help decorate the banner accordingly. I'm not sure how the voting will work yet so I have to fix that before anything else.  The reason why I'm asking about this suggestion is because I am currently working on a better implementation of a theme for the subreddit... yet again. I'm sorry, please bare with me! But if you wish to be a part of the testing group, please let me know.   Have a great day everyone!!"

I'd suggest 2 or 3 votes from each account more than a week old - Make up for the lack of members on the board while maintaining vote integrity, not to mention you can split the votes for your 2-3 oshis. Equality without power voters too.  Whether you want to include SNH, JKT and NGZK is up to you."

I never attended any JKT activities since Theater no Megami's Shonichi.  One example that I personally experienced:  During the 3rd Anniversary Concert, VIP ticket holders received '3rd Anniversary Concert After Party ticket', which is given at the entrance of the concert area. From the end of December (date of concert) until the moment you are reading this, there have been zero updates regarding the event. None.  JKT fans are getting burned out by horrible management. Some quit the fandom solely because they hated the management so much, and I might follow their footsteps if the management continues to be incompetent.  </rant>"

All idol groups are manufactured to a degree and I don't think Nogi is any more or less  manufactured than AKB.  Nogizaka46 has a sort of classy, elitist, pure image and that shows in the way they present themselves as well as a more strict dress code (no fake nails, etc.).

Probably they dug it up since Yukirin had gotten second place, and NEWS has a new single coming out...?  Hopefully, it's not going to escalate to something too major.I actually like both of them.  However, Johnny's wotas tend to get a bit too crazy over social media from what I remember. D:"
AKB48,39a69k,hachiagejo,4,Wed Jun 10 17:49:39 2015 UTC,I think it's far more likely that they had the photos but held on them in case she got #1 in the elections.

AKB48,39a69k,drkpneng13,5,Wed Jun 10 12:37:30 2015 UTC,As long as she is happy who cares? To be honest they look more like friends. I hate the no dating rule. Its literally in place so that wotas can have their fantasy and in a way that is extremely disturbing.

I'm not quite sure if there will be a full subbed version but I will let you know and keep an eye out!
AKB48,38sqnd,LambogenieMarci,3,Sat Jun 6 14:39:08 2015 UTC,"Thank you! Feels great to see takamina got her highest(?) ranking. On the other hand, it's sad to know that she's gonna leave. I'm kicking myself for not getting into akb earlier :( most of my favorites are from the earlier gens."

Don't feel too bad, you came in at a time of a new era. :) If you love earlier gens, I'm sure there are translated videos of their previous SSK ranking + speeches! Not to mention there's probably heaps of variety shows that have them as well."
AKB48,38sqnd,dnagi,3,Sat Jun 6 14:44:55 2015 UTC,Yes! Only watching AKBingo. But I think it's a good platform to get to know more about them. Perhaps newer episodes will show more of the new members.
AKB48,38sqnd,Lalalan,3,Sat Jun 6 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"I'm a Jiina fan after today haha, her speech will go down in 48g history.  Really exciting election. Almost none of my predictions were correct. I'm most pleased with how well Sae, Milky and Kitarie ranked. I think the most surprising ranks were Takamina's and Paruru's. I'm obviously pretty disappointed at a lot of girls who dropped, especially Akari and Haruppi. Though I wish Yukirin got 1st, Sasshi is seriously awesome so I'm not that mad. However idk if Yukirin will ever have another good shot at #1 again. :("
AKB48,38sqnd,IndoPr0,7,Sat Jun 6 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, Sasshi! She gets to wear the royal robe!!! Still waiting for the day Yukirin wins #1. SKE and HKT wotas do quite some work and it paid off for them. Ahhh, wish I could have seen it live but ah well. My girls did well. Still sad about Miki-chan. She's just not that popular compared to all the other Tentoumu Chu girls. Oh well, it makes the climb much more satisfying for her though right? She's still young."

AKB48,38sqnd,MalusRegis,2,Sat Jun 6 15:17:04 2015 UTC,Wanted Mayuyu to top but also wanted to see Yukirin getting #1 for the first time. Dissapointing that none of them actually won but still okay that they're ranked 3 and 2 respectively. Also sad that Jurina went down to 5. Though the great news for me was seeing Sakura at 7. Someone already mentioned it in the comments but her rise is just wow. Hopefully she gets to wear the robe someday and I can certainly see that happening :D
AKB48,38sqnd,darksteel2291,2,Sat Jun 6 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"The era of HKT is coming? They hold Senbatsu, UG, and Next Girls center.  Takamina gets her highest rank ever.  Sasshi leads by THAT MUCH VOTES?"
AKB48,38sqnd,fluubar,2,Sat Jun 6 22:56:20 2015 UTC,"Keeping it shorter this time, I promise.  Solid showing from SKE this year. With a total of 27 ranked members, roughly 1/3 of the SSK was SKE :D The campaign for ""SKE domination"" went better than I thought it would. Great in terms of number of ranked members, but only Jurina as a Kami-7 presence. That's the trade-off I suppose.  Glad to see the 5 members I voted for had generally positive results. Miyamae Ami (NR->45), Furuhata Nao (55->24), Shibata Aya (15->15), Churi (31->14) and Yui (13->10). After Ryoha, Rion, and Sarina were called I thought Anmi missed ranking for another SSK. I was really excited to see her rank 45th, and even more so as a first time ranking in this election with all the crazy voting numbers. It was also really nice to see Churi's first appearance in Senbatsu after all those years in Undergirls. Super happy for Yui making the Top 10 and at least she made it through another SSK speech :)  Not a fan of Dasu per se, but just as an SKE fan her drop out of Senbatsu was hard to watch. Seeing her without her usual energy and upbeat attitude was so unnatural. Nice return for Milky though, especially after last year! Paruru out of Kami-7 also surprised me.   Congrats to Sae and Takamina for their highest ranking ever (with a nice appearance from Acchan), and Sasshi for another historic win with a huge amount of votes.   Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go watch more ads about Japanese food, water, and last year's SSK."
AKB48,38sqnd,tplus1,2,Sat Jun 6 15:42:09 2015 UTC,"If you look at the press photo for the Undergirls as shown here, she's the one girl who isn't really looking that happy.  That drop really broke her spirit."

AKB48,38sqnd,OdaijiNi,4,Sat Jun 6 23:45:17 2015 UTC,"Sakura's growth has been absolutely amazing.  Going from 47th, to 26th, then 11th, and now entering the kami 7 at 7th.  That makes me happy to see.  In general, I'm happy to see more of the HKT48 girls continue to rank in and those who already ranked in, getting higher.  With the exception of Madoka dropping from 25 to 43, most rose.  Most impressive gains to me were Haruppi getting 17th and close to senbatsu, and Kojina Yui (recently got more into her) ranking in at 47th from nothing before.  Someone's comment on the AKB48 Wrapup post on the results had a tally on the number of ranked members each group had.   AKB48 - 23 SKE48 - 27 NMB48 - 14 HKT48 - 15 NGT48 - 1    Interesting to see that as far as numbers of ranked members are concerned, SKE now beats AKB48.  NMB48 still lags as HKT48 is now beating them by 1."

I'm not sure what to think about Sashihara,she really know how to play this whole game,but i am always under the impression that she never fully put her heart into this whole being an idol/akb48 thing.  I hope now that Jurina is 18 years old she could get into more shows and broaden her fans and climb much better in the ranking.Just hoping she wont graduate too soon."

AKB48,386xu2,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Wed Jun 3 02:54:38 2015 UTC,Tomochin has always had a dance style that really reached out to me. I don't know what it is but I think its just her passion for it.  I feel like the path she is going is going to be bright and I wish her all the best.
AKB48,386xu2,NavARXIDA,3,Tue Jun 2 15:32:03 2015 UTC,"For me, it's because her dancing is so COOL. When she dances, she makes sure her face is always facing the camera and hiding signs of the dance being tiring or difficult. She really does emulate Amuro Namie in that aspect. I went to one of Tomochin's solo lives... It was only about 100 people watching and the stage was really close to the seating area. She was so cool. Dear J gave me goosebumps, haha. I'm glad she's doing what she wants and how she wants to (like, not worrying about vocal ability, inserting rap/ENGLISH RAP that makes sense!!/styling her image how she wants to be seen) Really, as a fan, I'm really proud."

AKB48,37wc6y,RinaLuvsPandas,3,Sat May 30 23:47:17 2015 UTC,"Yea, these preliminary results are pretty telling, but everything is still early.   Here's a chart comparing this year's preliminary's compared to the previous one  So there are things like Mo Han being so low in place for the preliminaries but actually having more votes in this preliminary compared to the 1st election preliminary.   What's most telling for me is that Rank 1 is a Team X member and their team only premiered a few months ago. Regardless, lots of girls to watch out for in the future.   In regards with Wu ZheHan it'll be interesting to see if she can get her fans back. Her incident was probably still too fresh for most people during the voting period. We'll have to see how she handles this moving on."

AKB48,37wc6y,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Sun May 31 01:09:17 2015 UTC,"Nothing really in my opinion, but I don't know how her fans view it and I probably don't know enough about it.   She had private interactions with fans and this violated SNH48's Code of Conduct which resulted in her demotion from Team SII to kenkyuusei. She was then placed with Team X (4th gen) and the fans later were able to vote her back into Team SII after her interview so now she's in both."

AKB48,37na3h,daisukedesu,14,Thu May 28 21:57:29 2015 UTC,The very first rule of catching up with AKB is never get attached to older members.    You'll find yourself liking the newer members soon.
AKB48,37na3h,Xanthon,2,Thu May 28 22:40:12 2015 UTC,"I agree. Once you branch out into the other groups through watching their variety shows or listening to their songs or just watching something involving say NMB or SKE you'll find newer members to root for. Additionally once you catch up and start watching more current shows then current members will take up your interest, guaranteed."
AKB48,37na3h,iLoveThisPS3,2,Fri May 29 06:43:40 2015 UTC,Or you can watch what the old members are now doing and support them! Yuko-chan is amazing with acting!
AKB48,37na3h,Ekisho,1 point,Thu Jun 4 20:11:14 2015 UTC,Yup. This. I've come to terms with the fact that graduation is inevitable in AKB and so I try to not be too emotional when my oshimen(s) graduate.
AKB48,37na3h,Calvinized,7,Fri May 29 09:51:20 2015 UTC,For your information Takamina was the ace around 2006-2007. Just watch the first Team A stages (1/2) and you'll see she's pretty much the center.  I agree that I miss the first generations though. cries
AKB48,37na3h,hastetowaste,4,Fri May 29 00:22:16 2015 UTC,"On my first solo trip to Tokyo, I went to the AKB theater because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I walked through the lobby and spent about 5 mins looking at the portraits and perusing the gift shop before heading down to Don Quixote to get some snacks.   It was only after, when I flew back home, that I became a fan after finding out more about them in a magazine I picked up from Lawson during my stay.  Now I'm banging my head against the wall because I saw the portraits of Acchan and many now-graduated members and didn't even care enough to take pictures of them. The only thing I have now is a picture looking down the portrait corridor at that point of time."
AKB48,37na3h,dnagi,3,Fri May 29 13:09:35 2015 UTC,"My Oshi will also be graduating soon, most likely, and I've only been into 48G for around a year. Yeah, it's unfortunate, although there's really no alternate scenario, as I've only spoken enough Japanese to really appreciate it for that long. The good (some would say bad) thing about AKB is it's an eternal conveyor belt, so you can really enter at any point."
AKB48,37na3h,ForeverAclone95,3,Thu May 28 23:55:30 2015 UTC,"You’re not really alone. I became an active fan of AKB sometime last year, however I knew about AKB long before that. When I first got into it, I recognized Mariko-sama/Shinoda Mariko because I knew her from the Ouran movie, but I was depressed she had graduated already. Since Takamina is graduating and she's my oshi, I’m already sad I didn't get into the fandom sooner. :c"
AKB48,37na3h,hachiagejo,2,Fri May 29 06:46:26 2015 UTC,"Well. I can sympathize with you. When I first liked the group, Acchan had already left, so I wasn't into the whole ""Acchan's era is the best AKB era"" type of thing. But after binge watching akbingo like crazy, I can see the older members' charm, and I got to experience the sadness when one of my top oshi graduates (Yuko). My take on this is to move on and eventually you'll find someone new interesting then you'll start to support her. Thus is the cycle of a wota :P"
AKB48,37na3h,Calvinized,2,Fri May 29 09:49:09 2015 UTC,"I have been a fan only about a couple of months,obsessed through all the akbingos and akb shows,and end up finishing them all way too fast.So im stuck with pretty much nothing to follow in akb families.  Same boat as you,I really dont get the charm of most of the latest gen/younger members.Maybe because there are no shows/events to showcase their personality better,as the latest shows hasnt been subbed yet.So i cant really follow them too much.  I combat these feelings by branching out over to other groups though.And so far SKE turns out to be my most favorite group now,they have mostly the same members for a while and they seem to be much closer to each other.Plus the Ebi shows are very entertaining."
AKB48,37na3h,LuvList,2,Fri May 29 13:30:40 2015 UTC,"They're at a good place... The show is well thought out and it members full of life, totally different from how Morning Musume became."
AKB48,37na3h,SuperstarTinsanity,2,Sat Jun 13 12:36:23 2015 UTC,"Been a fan during the acchan years but I also found the frenzy about her graduation insane. She was alright, good dancer and singer but she didn't have the same charisma at MC as takamina, minami, sasshi, and pretty much most of the 1st gen. She was kind of awkward for me."

AKB48,37na3h,leopold_s,1 point,Fri May 29 06:10:46 2015 UTC,"I've known about AKB when Heavy Rotation was released. They were just rising stars then. But I started following them the following year, when I saw a video of their performance during Kouhaku. Yuko really caught my eye, and I've been a fan ever since.   Anyway, the only saddening thing that I can see from your situation is not being able to experience the fierce rivalry between Acchan and Yuko. It's AKB's  trademark... in fact, I think it's what made AKB this big. And this rivalry has been adapted to the sister groups.   Good thing about the 48 family is that there are always new talents to root for. Before, I thought that when Yuko graduated, I'm done with AKB. Though I'm not as enamored as before, I still stuck around. :) And who knows, maybe next year I'm rooting for a new member."
AKB48,37j389,IndoPr0,2,Thu May 28 00:15:55 2015 UTC,The one thing I hate about JKT's Kibouteki is their second verse. The choreography is lame (like the first 4 members turning around on the spot) and they should go to the back and let the middle ranked members start that second verse just like what they usually do with AKB.
AKB48,37j181,RinaLuvsPandas,7,Thu May 28 00:01:29 2015 UTC,"Yukirin will take over the crown of #1 in the home court of sashihara on 6/6. It's done deal, I don't even need to watch anymore, this is it."
AKB48,37j181,WaldsteinSonata,2,Thu May 28 01:18:15 2015 UTC,"I'm hearing a lot of predictions that Sasshi will take #1 again. Of course I'm rooting for Yukirin, but can she really beat Sasshi?"
AKB48,37j181,violeblanche,4,Thu May 28 04:55:07 2015 UTC,Last year Sasshi was head of Mayuyu by over 15000 votes in the prelims and Mayuyu ended up beating her by almost 18000 votes in the final.  This year Sasshi is ahead of Mayuyu by only a little over 8000 votes and she's ahead of Yukirin by only around 4700 votes.  Its still anyone's game. Anyone in the top 6 still has a chance (though the Top 3 are most likely).

AKB48,37j181,LuvList,3,Thu May 28 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"Im really fine with Jurina or Kashiwagi with no.1. I much prefer Jurina takes the top spot,but seems like impossible task with how many votes going for the top 3 alone.  Not really sure about the top 16,i think it might look the same like last year? Minus Rena i guess.Although Suda Akari's spot in prelim seems concerning,might see Kodama Haruka or Akane Takayanagi goes in senbatsu?  Kami 7 is the same girls but switch Rena for Takahashi.  Mind you im only like a couple months into this whole akb48 fan thing,so my prediction probably looking a bit weird."

AKB48,37j181,iLoveThisPS3,3,Thu May 28 05:46:38 2015 UTC,"It would be a great gesture by the fans to vote Takamina to the top, but realistically I don't think she's popular enough for that. I'm dying to know if Yukirin can defeat Sasshi, though, and if HKT fans will push harder for Sasshi since it's on their home turf this year."
AKB48,37j181,janelleski,3,Thu May 28 04:57:06 2015 UTC,"After seeing Iwatate Saho in NY I want her to rank, I want most of the girls from the Geinin shows to rank I want Oya Kitahara Kuramochi Paruru Mariko(Nakamura) lemon Takajo Myao and a lot of other members to all rank high...my dream senbatsu would never happen but if Takamina gets #1 I'll be happy. Admittedly I've liked Mayuyu and Sashihara more now whereas I've always liked Yukirin so really if it weren't Takamina I don't know which member I would like to take #1."

AKB48,378m1g,dokuromark,3,Mon May 25 19:39:31 2015 UTC,The Super Long Distance Tickets haven't really seemed to work.  My own experience using it yielded nothing and many others on Stage48 have reported also nothing happening from using that.  Your best bet is to go the regular route and apply through their ticket center.  There's no English translatoin for this site at all so you'll have to use Google translate to try to figure things out or use whatever knowledge of Japanese you have to work things out.  I used this when I went to Japan and was able to get tickets their Osaka Kyocera Dome performance during their 2013 5 dome tour in the summer.  Just be aware that the odds for getting a theatre show can be low and your best bet is to apply for every single day that you can.

AKB48,378m1g,piyochama,2,Tue May 26 00:16:54 2015 UTC,Protip: try applying with a person who's definitely performing as your stated oshi. That gives you a priority in ticketing

AKB48,36mwaa,zevz,2,Sat May 23 14:33:12 2015 UTC,Mayuyu can understand a bit but she can't reply. (she went for the Singapore concert and she seemed understand all the fans).   Not sure about sakuratan tho

AKB48,36mej1,TakeoRey,8,Wed May 20 13:24:15 2015 UTC,"Even though they are just prelims, I always like seeing who ranked. Haruppi outranking Sakura was a surprise. Yukirin at number two is a shocker. The biggest shocker is Tani at 11, I'm happy she's getting that SKE push."
AKB48,36mej1,PhantasyHero22,2,Wed May 20 14:28:04 2015 UTC,It's pretty insane how much traction Tani has gotten here at the prelims. I probably would not have predicted her to get this high but I'm glad she is ranked. She's so off the wall it's hard not to root for her.
AKB48,36mej1,piyochama,3,Wed May 20 18:09:41 2015 UTC,Tani is fucking AWESOME. Her song with Dasun and Kaotan was really awesome.

AKB48,36mej1,piyochama,3,Wed May 20 19:12:02 2015 UTC,Yeah that. No one knows where anyone will end up
AKB48,36mej1,OdaijiNi,2,Thu May 21 02:36:57 2015 UTC,"This should be an interesting year for the Senbatsu, of course especially for the number 1 spot. Last year showed how strong of aof a push members can get towards the end if voting. Very happy about Haruppi's spot. I hope she is able to maintain around there for her official spot. Also, I'm hoping to see Mio move up a lot from 30! These first day results are interesting, but still nothing to judge off of."
AKB48,36mej1,MalusRegis,2,Wed May 20 16:26:13 2015 UTC,"Despite how much/how little the preliminaries show, I was happy to see Churi (16th), Shibata Aya (9th), Nao (22nd), Tani (11th), Sakaguchi Riko (17th), Kumazaki Haruka (53rd), Souda Sarina (72nd), and Shibuya Nagisa (75th). I’m surprised that Kaotan is 14th despite her controversial comments in that episode of Zero Position and that Sahhoo didn’t rank at all. I’m really hoping Yui (20th) and Miyamae Ami (68th) go up further though."
AKB48,36mej1,fierce_glare,1 point,Wed May 20 19:15:48 2015 UTC,controversial comments?
AKB48,36mej1,MalusRegis,4,Wed May 20 23:06:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll try to summarize it without trying to skew the story. So in an episode of Zero Position awhile ago, the SSK came up as a topic. Kaotan definitely said that she wants to rank in the Top 16, but the controversy comes with some of the reasoning behind it. She said something involving how she would enjoy seeing the reactions of AKB fans if she was in Senbatsu. Some people have interpreted that she is just psyched for her own ranking and subtly encouraging people to vote for their oshimen to compete, while others have claimed that the way she said it implies that she wants to ""steal a Senbatsu spot from an AKB member"" and enjoy how angry AKB fans would be to see her in the Top 16.  After talking about the SSK, Kaotan then talks about how SKE should break away from AKB/the 48G and become independent. Although other members like Aya, Minarun, and Dasu were also on the program, they had a more conservative opinion on the topic. While Kaotan seemed adamant that SKE is good enough to be independent, the others only seemed to express that they would like SKE to be independent in the sense that SKE would be known for their own merits rather than being known solely as a sister group of AKB48. From what I could tell, they did not say they wanted to separate themselves completely from the 48G.   The whole thing brought up some...disheartening discussion among a few fans. Some fans even ended up calling SKE insignificant. While naturally some SKE fans were split regarding her comments, many people agreed that the way she said them could have been worded a little better.   EDIT: Sorry if that was a bit long. I just realized that this incident might be considered more of a problem for SKE fans than 48G fans in general, sorry for the poor word choice. If there's someone else who also knows about this, feel free to jump in and add anything or correct something I said."
AKB48,36mej1,GentlemanlyOctopus,2,Thu May 21 01:05:42 2015 UTC,"In the first comment, I think it's more ""Instead of another senbatsu slot taken by a more traditional idol, it's taken by a very non-traditional one."" It would be much more interesting.  The second one is pretty extreme. I really don't know her well enough to interpret if she's seriously speaking her mind, just being controversial, or is just showing how much she loves SKE."
AKB48,36mej1,piyochama,2,Thu May 21 02:25:37 2015 UTC,"I do agree with it though.  HKT/SKE need to break away. NMB has their whole ""Osaka"" thing going, and Nogizaka is probably the strongest idol group among the new wave. Neither HKT nor SKE can survive at this moment because they just don't have true identities."
AKB48,36mej1,iupecam,2,Thu May 21 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"Really happy Komiyama Haruka and Kato Yuuka ranked this year (even though just prelims). Hopefully they will do well. Such cuties.  *Edit: Just realize Kojimako didnt make the prelims rankings, and Akicha is so low D:"
AKB48,36mej1,sayajay,2,Thu May 21 00:35:40 2015 UTC,"It's kinda sad that NMB is not really well represented :-/  With the exception of Sayanee, there wasn't a single person from NMB48 in the top 16."

AKB48,36mej1,piyochama,6,Wed May 20 15:04:11 2015 UTC,"Basically in previous years, she would never get called during prelims so she'd say something like ""omg how could you guys not vote for me"" (implied) or ""this will be my final SSK"" (again, implied) on her blog so that fans would be guilt-tripped into voting her for the final count.   It's a lot of emotional blackmailing..."

AKB48,36mej1,RinaLuvsPandas,1 point,Wed May 20 19:00:04 2015 UTC,I think she announced in on Twitter? Apparently NyanNyan and Takamina gave each other some serious looks when Miichan ranked at 60.

AKB48,36kj70,piyochama,2,Wed May 20 07:27:43 2015 UTC,TEN VOTES HERE WE GOOOO  But yeah I'm pouring a ton of votes into Jurina and Yuihan.
AKB48,36kj70,MalusRegis,2,Wed May 20 14:55:47 2015 UTC,"Long post/comment incoming, sorry in advance.  So this year‘s Senbatsu Sousenkyo is definitely going to be an interesting one. Speaking in general (and after looking at the Preliminary Results), the rankings do seem to be a bit all over the place. I’m kind of hesitant about reacting too much to the Preliminaries, but it’s at least interesting to see.   In terms of predictions (before the Preliminaries were announced), I thought that the number one rank is going to either Sasshi, Mayuyu, or Yukirin. Sayaka is a bit of a mystery to me in terms of her rank. I know about her popularity and it’s well-deserved, but I honestly don’t follow her enough to know if she can finish in first this year. Jurina, on the other hand, I think I know a bit more in terms of ranking. As much as I would like to see her rank first (would have preferred Rena, but I’m glad to support SKE overall), I personally don’t think she will have a shot at first…not this time. I think she’ll be serious contender soon though, just not now. Interesting to see Takamina in the Kami 7. As great as the story would be if she finished first, I think her realistic ceiling is somewhere between 4th and 7th. Again this is just my own opinion. I would like to be proved wrong but I think the reasonable limit is 4-7.   This time around I have way more votes than I did last year, so hopefully I’ll be able to make at least a small difference. Most of my votes are going to Yui and Miyamae Ami, with the rest going to Churi, Shibata Aya, Nao, and Takamina.   Yui said she wanted to rank 7th, while Ami said her goal was 20th. Although I’m trying my best to support them both, I don’t think they’ll reach their goals this year. Yui has been awesome all year, but I think there are 10 members who are serious contenders for the Kami 7 spots. While I may think she deserves her goal, the Japanese fans have the power here. I’d honestly be happy with just an increase in rank from last year.   Ami is really big surprise for me. For those who might not have heard of her, she’s from SKE’s solid 5th generation and was definitely not as popular compared to other 5th gens like Nao, Harutamu, and Mizuho. She caught my attention as the center of Aozora Kataomoi at the Nagoya Dome last year and I’ve been a fan of her ever since. Her first senbatsu appearance as wcenter in 12-gatsu no Kangaroo was announced during SKE’s Request Hour and the crowd responded pretty well (the first thing that came to mind was Yui’s promotion announcement on stage years ago). She’s a hard worker, a good dancer who held her own in a competition with Kinoshita Yukiko and Ishida Anna (despite zero dancing experience prior to SKE), an approachable senior to younger members, and a big supporter of the group who doesn’t mind doing things for the benefit of SKE.   Even on her G+ she admitted 20th is a really high/impossible goal, but she’ll be fine with whatever happens and continue to move forward. Nothing fancy or revolutionary, but kind of refreshing to hear IMO. If you have time, I think this translated interview shows some good parts of her personality. I know there's plenty of other great members out there, but for whatever reason I found myself rooting for Ami in the same way I've been rooting for Yui. 20th seems way too high this year. I'd honestly be happy if she at least ranked, even more so if she got into Future Girls.   TL;DR: IMO Sasshi, Mayuyu, and Yukirin have a good shot at 1st, Takamina's ceiling is 4th-7th. Great start for Aya and Churi, hopefully Yui increases and Ami ranks. Gotta hope for the best!"

I'll be on the Selective Hearing podcast talking about our predictions so I may leave my thoughts for the show but I can't wait to talk about it all. I have four votes all from CD's that should be arriving soon. I think I've decided who should get them but that can change.
AKB48,36kj70,Shuumatsu-Heroine,1 point,Wed May 20 02:03:09 2015 UTC,"Does anyone know if there'll be an online livestream of the election this year? It really kills me not getting to watch it as it's happening.  As for expectations, of the people who could realistically take it I hope Sayanee gets number one. It would give her a well deserved boost in popularity amongst the non-otaku and make for the most interesting outcome IMO.  edit: Might as well throw in an unrealistic dream ranking for fun. Naanya gets number one forcing all the senbatsu OGs to graduate ushering in a second golden age for the young AKB(12 generation and up)."
AKB48,36kj70,akbzine,3,Wed May 20 06:13:37 2015 UTC,There are usually a few streams that pop up right before election time each year. I'll post them in this subreddit if I find them.

AKB48,36m0sm,piyochama,2,Wed May 20 14:11:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if sales were based on the quality of the song, Keibetsu Shiteita Aijou or something would be the million seller..."
AKB48,36m0sm,ForeverAclone95,7,Wed May 20 14:15:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mean the way to check whether or not the general population actually likes a song or not is to see karaoke rankings - preferably a year or two after the fact. I say year or two, because with literally one exception (Kokoro no Placard) AKB summer songs have always topped the monthly karaoke rankings.  Heavy Rotation, Aitakatta, Koisuru, Flying Get, Iiwake... Those were actually popular throughout Japan (not least because they top karaoke rankings like its no one's business). No one in their right mind would ever use physical sales as the only indicator of popularity."
AKB48,36m0sm,piyochama,1 point,Wed May 20 14:19:27 2015 UTC,"I'm in Japan right now, and go to karaoke frequently. Koisuru Fortune cookie and Heavy Rotation are the only AKB songs that make the monthly top 30, over and over again. You say my post doesn't make sense, but basically I wanted to say there is such a disillusion between sales and how the general public receives a song. Outside of the otaku fan base, NO ONE knows any AKB song in the last two years, except the two that I talked about above. Aki-P is pumping out songs so frequently (and you know what, good for him, he writes a loooooot of lyrics) but if you questioned a Japanese person on the street ""What's the name of that AKB song that Oshima Yuko graduated to?"" no one would be able to answer.  I LOVE AKB, I am a big fan. But I'm also looking at the bigger picture and it's just really weird."
AKB48,36m0sm,RedRebel915,2,Wed May 20 22:59:58 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure fans of AKB are well aware of this....I've never heard anyone brag about how popular AKB must be in Japan just because they hit #1 on the Oricon charts. It is true that the idol industry is set up so that it can try and make as much money as it can, but I think most of us put up with that side of it not because we are disillusioned, but because we want to follow and support our idols! :D  Also, I'm pretty sure this is AKB's record for first day sales so congrats to them! I think it would be great if the single could get popular with the mainstream public as well!"
AKB48,36m0sm,piyochama,2,Wed May 20 23:49:06 2015 UTC,"Koisuru Fortune cookie and Heavy Rotation are the only AKB songs that make the monthly top 30, over and over again.   Have you actually been following AKB for a while?  The way we fans knew that AKB was really at their prime was that they ruled the karaoke rankings from 2009 to 2012. That's how you know the general public knows a song or not - karaoke is cheap, it is ubiquitous, and relatively free to pick and choose between songs."
AKB48,36m0sm,piyochama,1 point,Thu May 21 02:32:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've been following since Iiwake Maybe and the sousenkyo attatched to that.  Sorry, I looked at my previous posts and I didn't mean to come off as argumentative. I made a post in another topic that more effectively conveyed my feelings, but I just don't like it when AKB singles sell like this. It's plastic garbage that fill up landfills. I wish if you bought a single digitally on iTunes or wherever, you could still have access to a handshake ticket or sousenkyo ballot. The boxes and boxes of the SAME cd that these fans are buying end up in the garbage or at book off. (I've been to some book offs that have entire shelves and bins for just the 48 group CDs, all priced at 100 yen)  Yes, props to Akimoto. Yes, props that this entire 48 business is supporting the idols and everyone gets to make a living off of an area where many idols struggle to accumulate fans, and therefor money. But it feels icky. It feels like gaming the system. It strikes me almost like mobile gaming and the ""whales"" that make up the 1% of paying customers, but also are the 1% that pay thousands and thousands of dollars.  I really like AKB, the girls, the personalities, the events, the TV shows and radio talk shows. But it's almost like it's getting hard to consider them as... music.  Sorry for the rant."
AKB48,36m0sm,piyochama,4,Thu May 21 02:52:22 2015 UTC,"If it does bother you at all, just remember two words: Endless Eight.  Gimmicks are not magical ""GET UNLIMITED SALES!!!"" fairy dust. Essentially, the easiest way to put it is that gimmicks only magnify existent popularity - they do not actually invent popularity.  An example is like so. Other groups, like AeLL or BiS, have much more extreme gimmicks than AKB, and yet they don't sell nearly as much. Arashi and JE tend to use the same gimmick (drama tie-ins) and yet their effect is much more pronounced than any other type of gimmick, save for AKB.  All of these are for a reason - gimmicks do not create popularity, they simply magnify it. You can't expect to sell even tens of thousands of copies if your base product is shit - just look at Kokoro no Placard's sales numbers, or the sales figures for Endless Eight from Suzumiya Haruhi."
AKB48,36m0sm,Lamiington,1 point,Thu May 21 03:57:32 2015 UTC,"I wasn't sure so I looked it up; Kokoro no Placard still sold a million copies in it's first week of sales. The song, in my opinion, was complete garbage and a copy of KS Fortune Cookie, but it still sold a million. I completely agree with you that gimmicks =/= unlimited sales, but hasn't 48 reached the point where no matter how bad a song is or uninspired the lyrics, music video, dance, etc is, it's going to a sell a million. No matter what.  However, this is the first I've heard of the Endless Eight thing, thank you for introducing that to me!"
AKB48,36m0sm,piyochama,1 point,Thu May 21 04:09:31 2015 UTC,"KKP was also AKS inflated to be 1 mm - they had an adjustment that was strange as compared to every single other song they've ever made.   Yes they haven't reached that point... But that's also because the system itself is made so that no song is THAT terrible. From what I hear they're similar (in style) to the JE system, so its not that bad."

AKB48,35cz8q,4ceTheAznInvazn,2,Sat May 9 07:30:10 2015 UTC,You drag in the direction the bubble shows. And for the golden ticket you can have as many as you want. Its the silver or different color tickets that you get from events that you want to spend. Usually you have around a couple days after the event the tickets were for wnds to redeem them on a vharacter in the store.

After levelling uo your character once, like from 4 star to 5 star, you need a duplicate of the lowest ranking version of the character you want to upgrade along with all the other red tracksuit members to get the second upgrade. Imo its kinda impossible to do it but theres always a sliver that you might happen to redeem it from the janken game. Hope this makes sense."

AKB48,35cz8q,MalusRegis,1 point,Sun May 10 03:56:53 2015 UTC,"Hey jumping in for a bit. I play mostly on the SKE side but the basics of the game are still the same on all sides, so I think I can help. The normal lesson/upgrade choice increases the ""performace"" points of the member. Also, only members at 100% are able to be upgraded for another star.   For example, yesterday I got a 5-star Watanabe Miyuki Coquettish Juutai Chuu Seifuku ver. B (getting ready for the upcoming Oshimen Event). At 0% her performance points were mid 20k. When you use the first option to increase the percentage to 100%, a 5-star member can then have somewhere near 50k performance points. Being at 100% then allows you to upgrade the star level if the specific member/costume allows for it.   A newly ""evolved"" 6-star member will go back to 0%, but then will have somewhere near the performance points of its previous 5-star version at 100%. Meaning? If you use the ""normal"" upgrade option to bring your 6-star to 100%, her performance points can peak somewhere between 70k and 75k (like my Coquettish Juutai Chuu Seifuku ver. B Milky :D). More performance points = higher overall scores on songs. You can also do the same process using a 6-star member as a base and upgrade to the 7-star version for a peak performance of around 80k to 82k (helpful in high scoring events, especially with a score-up ability).  Sorry for rambling a bit, but I think it might help explain how this works. Hopefully I was able to explain some of that properly. Also if anyone wants to add me as a friend (again, I basically play SKE side only), feel free!  Game ID: 38023424 IGN: JanKenPon"

Assuming that there will be a dedicated post for the voting discussions later on, I'll just mention a few general things:    I'm definitely voting this year, but I'm still trying to figure out how many votes I can get. Rather than splitting my votes evenly between AKB and SKE members like last year, I think than most of my votes are going to SKE members this year (Yui being the one exception). I'm a still a big fan of AKB, but I think SKE definitely needs some support in this year's election considering the recent instability. Unless I'm missing something, I feel like at least three members are serious contenders for first and the last few positions of the Senbatsu are a bit more unpredictable than in recent elections.   In terms of non-sousenkyo things:   I'm still really excited for the upcoming 48G Draft. I wasn't exactly thrilled after the first one in 2013, but I ended up really liking all of Team E's picks, Kawamoto Saya (Team B), and Souda Sarina (Team KII). I know it's not exactly an insanely popular event, but I'm hoping another Sayaya or Sutou Ririka might come up as rising stars in the future. After going through all the audition videos, I have a few members to keep tabs on that hopefully get selected and do well.  I've been out of the loop regarding JKT since the joint concert with AKB earlier this year, but I was pretty surprised Melody got third.   Just to spread some SKE love, here's SKE48's Premium Live Concert Part 1 and Part 2 available in 1080p from earlier this year if you haven't seen it. Haven't gotten a chance to find an SKE oshimen? Looking for a performance without WMatsui, Churi, or Dasu up front? If you have some time, feel free to check it out! It has plenty of camera time for Miyamae Ami and Kitagawa Ryoha and plus the footage is pretty nice in HD!"

Huge surprises (Melody on third, Sisil who went from zero to hero, Andela getting to Kami7), and a better sousenkyo than last year. Results can be seen on its own thread. During sousenkyo, Kinal said she will undergo a appendicitis operation. Get well soon! Aikatsu machines are now available on JKT48 Theater. Who wants to play one? Just yesterday (May 3rd), a few things happened:     4th Generation Finalists were seen on the theater. Around 20+ (Not all watched) watched Team T performed Te wo Tsuginagara. Grace (Team T) almost fainted after the last song. Some said it's due to exhaustion + lack of oxygen (A theater security guy told me he felt that the oxygen feels 'thin' due to the amount of people watching), combined with Grace's asthma.

I was tempted to do go but I would have had to pay ~$340 for airfare, $120 for lodging (two nights), and other costs for food/transit.  I figured it wasn't really worth the $500 or so for such a short performance with so few members..."

AKB48,34q1w8,darksteel2291,2,Wed May 6 03:23:00 2015 UTC,"You can also order from Amazon Japan as well as I think HMV Japan.  I haven't tried HMV Japan though.  My main experience is with CDJapan and Amazon Japan.  As far as the differences go between the regular and limited edition, the main difference is the bonus item that it comes with.  All versions will have voting tickets for the sousenkyou senbatsu, but the regular edition comes with a collectible photo rather than the handshake ticket that the limited edition comes with.  The limited edition I find worth getting if I was only able to use said handshake tickets.  Seeing as I can't easily travel to Japan on a whim and go for the handshake events, I go for the regular edition usually."

As a note, I find that Amazon Japan can be better value when you order in bulk as the costs of the items themslves are slightly lower than CDJapan (the difference is larger for higher cost items like AKB48 Group concert releases), and fast shipping (they only have one level) is cheaper on there than it is on CDJapan."

AKB48,34067b,ForeverAclone95,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:41:44 2015 UTC,What does draw you in? I'm curious of each person's reason. Was it the music? the appeal? the personalities of the girl?
AKB48,34067b,ForeverAclone95,5,Mon Apr 27 20:35:58 2015 UTC,"It was sort of a multi-step process for me. I'm learning Japanese, so to help with listening, I figured I should start getting into Japanese music. I watched some of their PVs on youtube, and while I knew it was super-sugary, I rather liked them. Then after doing some research, I sort of fell down the rabbit hole. There's just so much content and always more to watch/learn. Watching variety has been very helpful for my language skills.  But more than all of it, I think it's their 頑張る姿. They work so hard and are so sincere. It just makes you want to support them."
AKB48,34067b,macrocosm93,2,Mon Apr 27 20:53:17 2015 UTC,"I found my way into AKB 48 by being introduced to idols when Babymetal went viral then finding fansubbed episodes of AKBingo.  I LOVED AKBingo and ever since then I've been a fan.  The music was never really my kind of music but its been growing on me as time goes on.  As far as the sexualization and fetishization of minors... I think its a bit blown out of proportion. The actual sexualization is tamer than what we see in most countries, especially in America where young artists are practically encouraged to leak a sex tape in order to get publicity. I think the only weird part is the ages of some of the girls. But that's more of a cultural thing. And in a lot of ways the American standard is kind of arbitrary.  Young artists twerks on national TV in a thong, gets caught doing cocaine and leaks a pornographic images/video of themselves for publicity...  17 years old? CHILD PORNOGRAPHY, ARREST HER MANAGER, DATELINE SPECIAL ABOUT EXPLOITATION OF CHILDREN IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY!  18 years old? THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER! MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARD! ALBUM GOES MULTIPLATINUM! GIVER HER HER OWN REALITY TV SHOW!  IMO the American entertainment industry is way grosser and egregious when it comes to exploiting young people."
AKB48,34067b,machyna,6,Mon Apr 27 21:05:22 2015 UTC,I'm gonna disagree because I don't think the examples are really comparable. Miley Cyrus has way waaay more say in the music videos and photoshoots she does than any AKB member and she was never sexualized in her Disney days. Her current image was her choice and she's old enough to make it herself. I also can't think of any 18 year old American celebrities that are super sexualized. Kim K and Paris Hilton were in their mid-20s when their sex tapes leaked and even the raunchiest of American stars are in their mid-20s or older.
AKB48,34067b,AnataWaMigurushii,2,Mon Apr 27 21:46:06 2015 UTC,Miley Cyrus has way waaay more say in the music videos and photoshoots she does than any AKB member and she was never sexualized in her Disney days.   There was that controversy when she did a pole dance at the teen choice awards when she was 16.
AKB48,34067b,machyna,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:42:35 2015 UTC,That was the tamest performance ever but the huge deal that the media made over it speaks to how puritan America still is when it comes to sex.
AKB48,34067b,macrocosm93,5,Tue Apr 28 16:53:09 2015 UTC,No one in the 48G have ever done anything like that.  The Heavy Rotation video is the only thing I can think of that's sexually suggestive that a minor has been involved in. But everything else is way more tame than that teen choice awards performance.
AKB48,34067b,machyna,2,Tue Apr 28 19:15:12 2015 UTC,She literally held onto the pole for a minute and squatted once... It wasn't even a pole dance lol
AKB48,34067b,violeblanche,4,Tue Apr 28 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"The Zipper performance is more or less a strip show. No pole involved, but they're literally taking off their clothes. Plus, any performance by the now-defunct SDN48 was raunchier than that performance, although the members were all 18 and over."

AKB48,34067b,AnataWaMigurushii,1 point,Wed May 6 17:49:22 2015 UTC,There's also Britney Spear's early material. She was 17 at the time and the video for ... Hit Me Baby One More Time was controversial for having sexual overtones.
AKB48,34067b,machyna,3,Wed Apr 29 10:41:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I actually think Britney Spears is the one American celebrity whose sexualization and infantalization is really comparable to AKB girls. The media was obsessed with her romantic life from a disturbingly young age and she was always being asked about her virginity to the point where it was clear that the public was paying close attention to when she would finally lose it. It was extremely creepy and not at all surprising that she eventually had a mental break. :("
AKB48,34067b,Zarzen,7,Wed Apr 29 15:32:37 2015 UTC,"Apologizing ahead of time for the long post.  I agree with /u/RinaLuvsPandas on the Miichan incident.  I also think it's generally kinda hard for most people to really understand the concept of idols without taking a large amount of time to try and understand it.  Around 2009 I remember hearing about AKB48 for the first time on the Oricon charts. Without knowing a single about them. I dismissed them as some kind of over sexualized group that's making easy money off of creepy men. I later saw the PV's for Heavy Rotation and Ponytail to Shushu which only cemented what I     thought about them. It made me mad that this was beating other music I really liked in sales. I think this is where a lot of foreign fans get stuck.  I think I was only able to get into AKB because I saw them everywhere while I was in Japan for a year and the name stuck. I also watched the entire first season of Majisuka Gakuen only realizing it was them who made up the entire cast after I watched the last episode. I really liked Acchan at the time and wanted to watch some Japanese TV to help keep up with my Japanese while back in the states. I stumbled upon AKBingo and ended up marathoning all the episodes up until February 2011. I threw all my biases out the window and decided to check out everything else AKB had to offer and have been a fan ever since.  I still don't fully understand why I like them, All I know is that I do and that's enough for me.  Back on topic AKB is sexualized to a certain extent, but not quite as much as groups in the west. The minors in the group don't wear  outfits that are very revealing. The members even get to choose if they themselves want to wear a bikini or participate in gravure. It's these things that are hard for people who aren't fans to see.  Even for me it's still awkward when I see a 16 or 17 year old member wearing a bikini, but I just think to myself that they are a hard working, smart, young adult who chose to do this and it is cute."
AKB48,34067b,machyna,7,Mon Apr 27 19:29:46 2015 UTC,"For the gravure thing, while members are free to turn down those photoshoots there's a lot of unseen pressure to do them. It's the most effective way for a member to get exposure so I wouldn't doubt that there's many who would rather not do them but feel pressured to."
AKB48,34067b,Zarzen,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:32:02 2015 UTC,"That is true. We may never know exactly the kind of pressure they go though/feel and what else they may have been made to do out of pressure. All we can do is support them in their decisions.  This reminded me though. Does anyone watch Kawaiian TV? I think it would help if all 48 group members did something similar to The ""Not seemed to be an Idol!!"" show NMB does. It could help lessen worries some might have and relieve some pressure, while giving them a clearer path to take. How much they take away from it is up to the individual though, and it's not as though most of the information presented isn't already available to them in some form."
AKB48,34067b,violeblanche,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:56:35 2015 UTC,"No apologies needed :)  I have a quick follow up question if you wouldnt mind.  While you were in Japan for that year, how often would you see products, news stories, ads, and general media that included or focused on AKB? How frequent did the name AKB come into your vision?"
AKB48,34067b,ForeverAclone95,8,Mon Apr 27 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"I live in Japan right now and AKB48 are everywhere.   Any given day they'll be guests on at least one TV show, they have their own shows (at least?) 3 times a week, and usually there's some drama ongoing with a member starring. At any given newsstand they'll be on the covers of at least 2 magazines. They have their own weekly newspaper that's available at any convenience store. HKT48 does all the in-store announcements for current discounts at the supermarket near me, and Nogizaka46 do the in-store radio ads at the local FamilyMart. There are hanging ads for Mayuyu's drama on the city tram. I've seen home-made posters rooting for Yukirin in the upcoming AKB48 elections, and the local tourist bureau uses her as their image girl so she's on posters everywhere and there's a cardboard cutout of her welcoming you to the central train station. The 100 yen store plays muzak versions of their songs. There's an AKB48-branded ISP. Right now FamilyMart has a big campaign where you can get point cards or even credit cards with AKB48 members on them, and they have banners outside each convenience store advertising it. The sushi restaurant I frequent usually makes set menus with AKB48-related puns (like ""SKE480 set = Shake, Kani, Ebi 480 yen"".  You can't escape them for a day if you get out of the house at all."
AKB48,34067b,Zarzen,3,Tue Apr 28 13:36:51 2015 UTC,"I love AKB, but I have to say I'd probably get super sick of them if I had to see/hear them that often..."
AKB48,34067b,machyna,2,Wed Apr 29 07:05:16 2015 UTC,You're in Kagoshima? One of my favorite cities. I remember yukirin giving recorded announcements on the bus lol.
AKB48,34067b,ForeverAclone95,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:10:49 2015 UTC,"I was in Nagoya as an exchange student so I didn't get around too much, but I saw poster ads in nearly all convenience stores, in the magazine sections of convenience stores there would be 5 or 6 magazines with them on the cover, I saw them on chocolates in the candy section. In a restaurant I frequented I saw SKE48 on the menu. There were poster ads on the side of the subway train.  I didn't notice them in the news at all, but that's because I never watched the news, I didn't watch much TV at all actually, but when I did I would see them and SKE in maybe 2 or 3 commercials every half hour."
AKB48,34067b,slimuu,5,Mon Apr 27 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest and most urgent issue is the exploitation of minors. It still makes me uncomfortable that girls are recruited from really young ages - it puts them in a prime position to be groomed by abusers before they know any better. The sexualization is really dangerous, too. I'm sure that story from a few weeks back about the manager arrested for naked photos of members is only the tip of the iceberg. Part of it is due to the fact that Japan still has lax child pornography laws, this kind of thing is rampant behind the scenes.  The Miichan thing is a result of what happens when you treat idols as a commodity. I think it's getting a bit better though, Sayurin's popularity was barely affected by her scandal. Hopefully in a few years idols dating won't matter at all.  Also, the circumstances of Aki-p's marriage were creepy and make all of 48g look shady by default."
AKB48,34067b,machyna,6,Mon Apr 27 19:31:47 2015 UTC,"The thing that pisses me off most is how unfair and absurd the pay scheme is. If there was a performer's union like we have in the States, these groups would look very different."
AKB48,34067b,fierce_glare,1 point,Mon Apr 27 20:56:12 2015 UTC,"A lot of industries in Japan would look different. People are looking at AKB as a singular group with issues that are affected by the way they're managed.   In Japan, the work-life balance needs to be addressed across the board. The cultural component of not questions your superiors needs to be addressed. The way sexualization and pandering to a set of unquestioned expectations needs to be addressed. Wota/otaku culture as it pertains to the privacy and well being of talent, and the way agencies both manipulate and pander to extreme fans almost exclusively needs to be addressed. and Gender roles needs to be addressed. The treatment of idols period and the treatment of idols in 48G in particular is always going to be the same until the fundamental aspects of labor, culture, gender and sexuality that they touch are addressed in Japanese society."
AKB48,34067b,machyna,1 point,Wed May 13 02:48:58 2015 UTC,"I'm inclined to say that my views are similar to yours on the topics I asked about, and I didn't actually know about Akimoto's marriage so thank you for that info.   Do you think part of the reason for the no dating rule and the whole reason the Miichan incident was such a big thing was due to the otaku fans' wanting to keep the girls ""pure and innocent"", or possibly another ulterior motive?"
AKB48,34067b,Dewgoode,2,Mon Apr 27 20:26:40 2015 UTC,"I think the no dating rule mainly exists because a big part of idol appeal and the way they are marketed is that they're meant to be ""dream girls."" It's even more pronounced for 48groups because of handshake events and that you can actually meet your idol. I don't think the motive is any deeper than trying to sell a fantasy to fans who believe they have a chance at dating their idol someday. Unfortunately it breeds a possessive and unhealthy attitude in those fans which leads to incidents like Paruru's recent handshake, where a male fan didn't let go of her hand.  The innocence thing is a bit more complicated, but there's definitely still a stigma about girls maintaining their ""purity."" I know a lot of Nogi fans were really mad Sayurin didn't get any punishment for her scandal, and some think Wakatsuki Yumi is disgusting for having had a sugar daddy. Wotas often dig into the pasts of the girls, looking for photos of them with any boys as evidence of past boyfriends. I've even talked to other Nogizaka fans who said they were former AKB fans but prefer Nogi now because they don't do gravure. I think these are the most hardcore of male fans, though, and they're a shrinking minority as Nogizaka is getting more popular with girls."
AKB48,34067b,RinaLuvsPandas,1 point,Mon Apr 27 21:19:22 2015 UTC,This is the first I've heard about Aki-p's marriage? Story?
AKB48,34067b,RinaLuvsPandas,3,Thu Apr 30 03:56:18 2015 UTC,"His wife, Mamiko Takai, is an idol from one of his former groups, Onyanko Club. She joined the group when she was 18 and married him when she was 21. Her age isn't the problem so much as the fact that he dated a girl he was supposed to be managing, it casts a weird power dynamic over their relationship."
AKB48,34067b,piyochama,4,Thu Apr 30 04:23:28 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the criticisms are valid concerns: the potential for exploitation in gravure (especially with the conformist cultural mentality in Japan, but sexual objectification is a problem basically everywhere with slightly different circumstances), the use of really young members and how they are especially vulnerable, the tricks management uses to increase CD sales, the love ban (I just don't think it's right to control someone's life to that degree. They do it in kpop too, but I can see how it's really weird to someone who is totally unfamiliar with idols), etc.   I'd add that I have a problem with how management handles members' growth. If they want the group to really be a stepping stone into entertainment they need to give the girls more opportunities to grow their skills in areas they are actually interested in."
AKB48,34067b,piyochama,5,Sat May 2 16:01:51 2015 UTC,"The Miichan incident is sort of cringe worthy in my opinion. Okay yeah it was awful, but technically it was her fault (sorta). Here you have a 21 (20?) year old girl whos life for the past 8-9 years has been AKB. She wakes up sees her scandal and pretty much has a mental break down that lead to her shaving her hair off. Did she make a mistake? Hell yes. The video, however wasn't necessary. Its sort of like the scandal with Brittney Spears when she shaved her hair off. On the good side of all of it she looks hella cute with short hair and shes the captain in two different teams and I doubt she would of gotten that before. She also seems happier then before."
AKB48,34067b,piyochama,2,Mon Apr 27 15:34:05 2015 UTC,"Two follow up questions, if you don't mind: What do you think of the no dating and relationship rule for AKB and why does it exist? Also do you think it's right for these organizations to control their private lives as well as the fans giving backlash for living a normal life off-stage?"
AKB48,34067b,piyochama,2,Mon Apr 27 20:34:33 2015 UTC,"In my personal opinion I don't agree with it. I feel like dating and being normal is fine and every idol should have the ability to enjoy having a boyfriend in high school. This is obviously my personal opinion, but I know as a 16 year old girl I loved having a boyfriend in high school, it made me feel like I was like everyone else. So I really wish the girls could date and be idols as well. The rule exist to make the girl seem pure and innocent so pretty much real life fan service to the fans of akb48. I find it sorta disturbing..."
AKB48,34067b,piyochama,2,Tue Apr 28 02:22:23 2015 UTC,"I guess I came in a little late. Some thoughts...   Before starting, a lot of the criticism that I see in the West are blatantly Western-centric. Things like ""wow Miichan shaved her head?"" or the no-dating rule are so misunderstood, it just becomes a parody. When criticism of AKB (or any idols, in fact) start with this, I just tend to ignore them, because I know that what I read will be complete and utter bullshit. Over-sexualization is a problem in the entire industry - no geography is excluded. I don't really care too much about fetishization as I do the problems with couch casting everywhere in the world - everyone and their mother (from famous people like Gwyneth Paltrow to people within the J-pop industry) talk about it. This is the major problem that lies within not just AKB but in ALL of music everywhere, and is a problem that never really gets discussed.  The so-called issues people have with AKB distorting sales is pathetic. Japan has had a digital market for about 20 years come 2019. Oricon was never meant to be a definitive popularity chart, only a chart of ""I have [x] number of people willing to pay for my shit"". The idea that one group and one group alone could somehow dismantle the system is idiotic at best."
AKB48,34067b,piyochama,1 point,Fri May 8 01:45:47 2015 UTC,"Late you are not, but against my positions you most certainly are. I can agree on your second point, but I'm quite interested to learn why you think the Miichan/no dating rule are misunderstood. Do you think that the rule is just or that there's something in it most don't get?   Also how can you say that thousands of people buying 10-1000 copies of the same CD is not distorting the charts in any way? I think that the power of the Otaku is mighty and that they certainly have the ability to fuck with a system that was never meant for such fanaticism."
AKB48,34067b,slimuu,2,Fri May 8 02:25:44 2015 UTC,"For the Miichan/no-dating rule, people underestimate severely the impact that Buddhism had (and still has) on Japanese culture today. It's because of the so-called ""dedication"" that an idol has to their given art form, and dating is seen as detrimental to that dedication.  I don't really think that it really distorts the system as much as you think. Otherwise any group with enough gimmicks would easily outsell AKB - and yet they don't. Look at groups like Kamen Joshi or AeLL - their gimmicks are even worse, and yet they don't even crack a dent into AKB's sales. People also forget that AKB's heyday was during 2009 to about 2012, when handshakes were super-limited - only 3 events, and a limited number of girls.   To be honest, the physical charts were never really representative of popularity - quite frankly, the physical media have been dead for a really, REALLY long time. To think that the charts are representative of anything but ""oh these people are willing to buy several copies of your product"" is just inane."
AKB48,34067b,fierce_glare,2,Fri May 8 02:30:08 2015 UTC,"Oh yes let's completely disregard that the target/intake audience for AKB and other idol groups, which are men ages 20-40, learn more towards Shintoism and no religion. Buddhism my ass. The main reason that rule even exists is to tease the desperate male fans into believing that their favorite idols are pure and available for them to take/protect from become unpure. Your point is just the front they use for the fans to make it way more acceptable to the public.   Honestly I can't comment on the sales figures as well, but I do know that Japan is still invested into the physical market way more than the west so physical sales are definitely still a factor. Also the handshake tickets aren't the only things that come in the CDs, voting ballots, which is what's coveted even more so, are important to the fans. Imagine single-handedly getting your favorite idol in the next CD and on the next cover. That's what they think and what they do, and not to listen to their favorite idol sing, well not all the time, but it's just for the satisfaction of helping them and feeling like they could get recognition for doing so. It can't be reasonably explained because the actions done by these fans aren't reasonable."
AKB48,34067b,machyna,3,Fri May 8 02:54:21 2015 UTC,"which are men ages 20-40, learn more towards Shintoism and no religion   Do you really think over 400 years of Buddhist influence would be cleansed from a culture like that?   Do you really think that Japanese Shintoism would be completely uninfluenced by Buddhism? Especially since most people have Buddhist funerals in Japan?   That isn't a ""front"", that's the actual explanation. If you actually watched Miichan's video, as I did, for example, she specifically apologizes for being ""distracted"" and ""neglecting to do her hard work"".   Get your Western-centrism out of here.    Japan is still invested into the physical market way more than the west so physical sales are definitely still a factor.   Without AKB, the next highest album, barring other (predominantly male) idol hits would be something that brings in perhaps 200k in sales, which is a mere fraction of the US album sales market.   To assume that these fans are ""irrational"" is absurd. Barring obvious economic fallacies, people are rational actors when it comes to their own finances - the actual fans that buy huge stacks of singles without the incentive to make a profit (and if you live in Japan, that profit is HUGE) is minimal.   Also, you're preaching to someone who's been following not just AKB but the entire Japanese entertainment market as a whole for a very, long time, both as a participant and from an academic/business lens. A lot of your points are mere fallacies that Westerners make when looking at any given Asian market."
AKB48,34067b,macrocosm93,2,Fri May 8 03:01:43 2015 UTC,"Okay I over stepped with my buddhism comment, but I simply can't believe that you think what comes out of the mouth of an apologizing idol is what actually is the case. Sure that can be an opinion the idols or fans have, but you can't say thatsome aren't motivated by jealousy and their want to keep them pure. You could say that the idea of  ""Pure Maidens"" comes all the way back from the fedual era, or further, and that it also has influence on the modern culture, such as your buddism return argument.   On the second quote, I wasn't comparing Western and Japanese album sale by any means. I'm saying that the percentage of physical sales compared to digital in Japan is higher than in the West per market.     Also to say that everyone is good with their own personal financial decisions is laughable. Hoarders are an extreme example, but they most certainly exist. Same goes with players of card games. Hardcore Magic and YUGIOH players spend hundreds on cards just for creating a deck to get enjoyment out of. People value objects and acts often times far more than their own money. Also when your marketing is as huge as the AKB organization's, it's quite easy to influence your target audience.   Honestly I'm preaching to you to get more out of you. You're the first person in this thread with severely dissenting opinions, so thank you :)"

It still doesn't disregard the fact that this is the standard all idols, regardless of gender, are held too. Furthermore, it doesn't make sense when you consider that all school levels in Asia generally ban dating. What then? Do you just disregard all of these points in order to frame your argument that this is still for ""pure virgin idols""? (Especially when several have confirmed that they've dated prior to being idols?)  This ""pure maidens"" bullshit is basically Eurocentrism at its finest.    Hardcore Magic and YUGIOH players spend hundreds on cards just for creating a deck to get enjoyment out of. People value objects and acts often times far more than their own money. Also when your marketing is as huge as the AKB organization's, it's quite easy to influence your target audience.   The hardcore magic, Yugioh and AKB fandoms have one thing in similar - the more you know the market, the easier it is to profit off of it. One of the reasons why sales for AKB were higher prior to 2012 is that they separated the handshake and photo cards in singles after Acchan left - prior to that, it was easy as hell to make money off of a single. In fact it still is, you just have to know how to use it.  To assume that their actions, regardless of profitability, is ""irrational"" is pathetic. It basically says ""well I can't understand why you're doing something, so I assume you have no reason to it"". That's just an admission of your failure to understand how they understand what value something has to them.   To be frank, physical sales are only one indicator of popularity. People don't seem to understand that AKB's sales are ONLY possible through a combination of popularity and gimmicks - of the few songs that hit a million downloads ""golden"" style (Karaoke + radio + downloads + physical sales) in the past ten years, a good chunk of them are all AKB songs. Simply put, you cannot have this level of sales without the popularity first."

AKB48,32w8e9,Ruukasuunrio,7,Fri Apr 17 05:50:47 2015 UTC,"Went to Japan in Febuary for 3 weeks, solo applied for a team 4 show via ""Super Enpou"" through email in January, never got a ticket (or any kind of response).  While in Japan I signed up for the actual ticket application website. Applied for 4 Team 4 shows, and 2 K2 shows. I signed up for the website using the address of my hotel which was located in Tokyo.   For the Team 4 shows I was only able to apply for the ""General Admission"" category, for the K2 shows I was able to apply for ""Enpou"" and ""General Admission"". Only ticket I got was for the K2 show. I got it after failing to get in through ""Enpou"" and applying a second time through ""General Admission"". If your host house is in the Tokyo area you should have 1 chance to apply for each AKB show and 2 chances to apply for each NMB show. You can probably get more if you want to figure out how the Fanclub stuff works.  When picking up your ticket they ask for ID to match it to your profile. I provided my passport as identification. They then asked me what the address I signed up for was, I told them it was my hotel and they just said okay and then gave me my ticket. Honestly, I would bring some kind of proof of address just incase, I think it was just luck that they didn't press further (If it counts for anything I'm Asian with a Canadian Passport).   Also this might just be hearsay but even though the ticket application site is supposed to be random I've heard some things are able to tilt chances into your favour:   When signing up for the ticket distribution website, you are able to pick (I think) 3 favourite members for each group. Supposedly if you apply for a show where a member that you listed as a favourite is performing you get a better chance at getting a ticket. Apparently every time you apply for a show and get rejected you have an increasingly better chance of getting a ticket for the next show(s) you apply for.   Personally I think these might hold some truth. As I said I applied for only Team 4 and Team K2 shows. On my account i listed Komiharu as the only member on my AKB list and I listed Rena, Tani, and Suda on my SKE list. The K2 show I won the ticket for was one that coincidentally had Tani and Suda in it even though they're both Team E. Also while I was there I noticed A LOT of people with Tani fansigns. This show was also the 5th show I applied to, giving me 4 previous fails to possibly have boosted my chances."

I bought 10 votes that year as it was probably close to the same price as buying two cds. followed the guide and voted  This time I just gave someone $100.00 to vote (so easy)  Just checked stage48.net and the forums have changed they might not let people advertise for collecting money and what not.

AKB48,32092c,shinyuu3466,3,Thu Apr 9 15:22:41 2015 UTC,Is the whole 48G thing still looked down upon in Japan? The girls are everywhere and I think idol music is on a good groove again.  I've noticed the lack of crossovers too. I thought they'd be common since some members are sent to the overseas 48 groups. Or are they there just to give the group's presence locally a boost?
AKB48,32092c,IndoPr0,2,Thu Apr 9 18:29:13 2015 UTC,I think it will be either Harugon or Nozawa (Nozawa was transferred from JKT48). She translated for AKBxJKT concert MCs.

The fans were mostly also AKB fans, the rest are from people that were interested to Pocari Sweat x JKT48 ad (Heavy Rotation is just that catchy). There are some backlash though from 'purists', saying ""48G has only four groups"", "" trash cover group"", etc.  At the start, they cooperated mainly with MNC Group TV stations, since one of the MNC guys (Reino Barack) helped in establishing JKT48. Reino is one of the judges in JKT48's final audition.  They steadily rise through TV appearance in MNC Group-owned TV stations like RCTI and Global TV. Global also aired JKT48's first TV show, JKT48 School.  In this process, Nabilah and Melody got really popular. Melody was the one pushed by the management, and Nabilah attracted enough people that the management kept her spot at the front.  BTW, JKT48 and AKB48 held two joint concerts in Indonesia. One in 2012 and one earlier this year."

I'm curious if whether they're seen as a serious group or just there for the novelty of a localized J-Pop idol group. If J-Pop is big in country then I guess the idol thing would've worked out.

Kpop has been on it's descent here after a couple years of being big, Japanese media haven't been as popular in the mainstream since the local anime boom of the early 00's. I'm glad Indonesia is still into it, I hope to visit soon for that alone. Hope a JKT show is more accessible than AKB ones lol"
AKB48,32092c,RinaLuvsPandas,1 point,Fri Apr 10 01:23:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think J-culture popularity is one of the key.  By the way, I just remembered that I met someone from PH during the previous AKBxJKT concert, any chance you know him?"

In my opinion it's popular but there is still some hostility between Japan and China so some people disagree."
AKB48,32092c,toomuchidea,3,Fri Apr 10 06:49:25 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend was in China and she didn't see much of anything that involves SNH. I wanted her to get me a CD at least. Technically she was in Beijing though so I don't know if they don't have stuff outside of Shanghai.  I wonder about the hostility too, won't there be negative reactions in general to the SNH project being a Japanese one even if the girls are local"
AKB48,32092c,TotallyNotPinoy,2,Fri Apr 10 09:37:04 2015 UTC,I remember during the anniversary of Nanking Massacre that the theater was doused in black paint. So yeah there is definitely some hostility but even so the girls continue to shine.

AKB48,31egcu,iLoveThisPS3,1 point,Sat Apr 4 19:39:26 2015 UTC,"IMHO, I feel like it just boils down to intuition. You can compare as many characteristics between as many members as you want, but it all comes down to a gut feeling in the end.  Of course there's nothing wrong with liking multiple members, or even everyone. Comparing more than 2 or 3 things is difficult for your brain as is, let alone 260+. I'd be surprised if you didn't have trouble picking an oshimen. lol  edit - Or you could just do it March Madness-style and run a tournament bracket with the girls you like more. It adjusts the comparisons down to a much more manageable scale. That said, I still feel that intuition is the way to go."

AKB48,31egcu,piyochama,2,Sat Apr 4 22:16:08 2015 UTC,"I just had one of the worst moment in my idoling history.  Yesterday (GMT+7 time wise), I went to JKT48's Sousenkyo Campaign and Direct Selling. For those who do not know, it's where members will sell CDs directly to the fans. You can talk a bit to the members while she/they give you your CDs, and might take a good deal of time if you're buying in bulk! Did AKB48 have something like that? I'm not an AKB48 expert, sorry.  During campaigns, people lining up could ask questions to the member currently on stage. I've been marked because I asked... well... too frequently. Four or five members, i think?  On to the final session. Since the doors are closed, the amount of people inside the theater is dwindling like crazy. Because no one is asking, I decided to.. well.. ask some more. I asked to TEN members.  Horror came when it's Haruka's turn to be on stage. Since she's the absolute last, the theater only got around.. 10-20 people inside. ""Why should I campaign, there's barely no one in here!"" ""Don't worry, this will go on YouTube.""  I'M DONE. I'M SO DONE. If the video is uploaded per member, I will have my face on almost... a... sixth... of... all... videos...  I wonder if the video editor will become bored of my face. ""Him again?""  Time to avoid the theater for a while.    In other news, looks like Team T's Michelle will be featured in Majisuka Gakuen 4's spinoff. I asked her ""At AKB48xJKT48 concert, I remember that in the reveal picture (where Michelle first announced her appearance at Majisuka Gakuen 4), you wore Majijo uniform. Why at Episode 9 you appeared in Gekioko uniform?"" ""Just wait for the spinoff!""  Looks like it will be on episode 5 of the spinoff ""Serious Transfer Student Arrives!"" I'll watch it."
AKB48,31egcu,OdaijiNi,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:24:00 2015 UTC,I've been going back and listening to a lot of the early Stage albums from AKB like Team B's Pajama Drive and Team K's Party ga Hajimaru yo. I'm finding so many fantastic songs that I haven't heard before. Just wondering if anyone had any recommendations for any stage albums or particular songs from them?
AKB48,31egcu,piyochama,2,Sat Apr 4 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"Watch the Minogashita stage (marathoned, if you can) or this year's zenkoku tour. There's so many great stages.   To be frank, I consider AKB's stage albums to be their only albums, in the traditional sense. Everything else is just best of collections."
AKB48,31egcu,OdaijiNi,2,Sat Apr 4 22:17:38 2015 UTC,Thank you! I'll definitely check those out.

AKB48,318hbb,4ceTheAznInvazn,3,Thu Apr 2 20:58:25 2015 UTC,Oh for f*** sake... This always happens before election time. They take some old ass pictures and try to knock the girls down. This is ridiculous. I'm not going to say this okay but im going to hope that the guys were managers for AKB and that the girls were just being girls. This was at Takamina's 20th birthday so it just looks like they all partied themselves out.
AKB48,318hbb,RinaLuvsPandas,6,Thu Apr 2 21:01:11 2015 UTC,The theater manager for akb was there ( like the woman) and kitagawa kenji was also there. Lol honestly everything here is fine except when the guy decides to pull his pants down.
AKB48,318hbb,RinaLuvsPandas,1 point,Thu Apr 2 21:46:07 2015 UTC,I really hope it doesn't effect their sales.
AKB48,318hbb,piyochama,1 point,Thu Apr 2 22:19:54 2015 UTC,I doubt it
AKB48,318hbb,Cmckendry,5,Fri Apr 3 17:09:07 2015 UTC,"Bigger than the issue of the guys (who apparently are AKB theater staff, although I haven't seen official confirmation of that) there are allegations of underage drinking involved here. At the time of Takamina's 20th birthday, Miichan would have been under 20, which is the Japanese drinking age.  Fortunately, it looks like the media isn't making a huge deal of this, at least so far. Given that it was a while ago, it seems like most people are prepared to more or less write it off, but obviously that could change depending on how it's handled.  Miichan hasn't posted anything to her G+ or twitter accounts since yesterday, which is kind of giving me a sinking feeling in my stomach. I really just want to know that she's ok. I really hope that this just blows over. If it dings sales for a month or two then so be it, I just hope they don't force anyone to graduate or transfer one of the girls to JKT or something..."
AKB48,318hbb,hachiagejo,2,Fri Apr 3 00:59:13 2015 UTC,"You're pretty much right on this. Miichan was actually 18 around this time, and various reports were saying that she might have drank alcohol with them (possibly getting drunk as well).   With Kayano Shinobu and Kitagawa Kenji there, their reputations might take a hit for letting it happen, especially since they're well-known staff members.   I'm hoping they'll write it off, but it's just depressing they threw it out there before elections."
AKB48,318hbb,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Fri Apr 3 01:21:56 2015 UTC,Its already so hard to keep up with Miichan (I live in America). She tries so hard. She keeps on trying and for them to keep throwing stuff at her... Its annoying... I just want her happy.
AKB48,318hbb,Cmckendry,3,Fri Apr 3 01:07:27 2015 UTC,I actually got the chance to meet her at an event back in January. It was a huge amount of trouble to get there (I live in NYC) but totally worth it. Incredibly moving experience.  People seriously need to back off and let her do her thing.
AKB48,318hbb,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Fri Apr 3 02:05:47 2015 UTC,"I've never met her but to me shes really amazing. I was really sick during my teen years when I found out about AKB and for some reason Miichan's long hair caught my eye and my first thought was, ""Her hair is too long. How can she dance like that?"" but before I know it I was able to pin point her out and I started supporting her. When her scandal happened and she went bald I thought, ""I'm never going to pin point her."" but it was exactly the opposite I was still able to. Miichan is my favorite due to how strong she is, her strength gives me strength and I want nothing more but to see her happy."

AKB48,30zhab,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Wed Apr 1 01:33:45 2015 UTC,Aw im liking the sound of it. I feel like ill like it more once I hear the studio version / PV. Also unfortunately I don't think they'll ever change up their senbatsu unless they're pushing someone in particular (besides the few from like the 3rd row they like to swap around.) We only get the janken for completely different senbatsu but unfortunately even that seems a bit rigged.
AKB48,30zkyo,whatupbiatch,6,Tue Mar 31 23:38:19 2015 UTC,Probably won't be  out for a few months until the dvds of the concert get released
AKB48,30sq18,IndoPr0,2,Mon Mar 30 11:49:54 2015 UTC,That is amazing! I really hope they get their own single now!
AKB48,30sgj0,Japaliicious,4,Mon Mar 30 09:18:27 2015 UTC,"I don't really keep up with news of the graduates. I only know Tomochin got plastic surgery for bigger boobs and she fixed her teeth. She had a Asia tour as well, so things seem pretty good. I actually saw her in Taipei.   There's no single reason for kennin. Sometimes it's to put some star power into weaker teams, like transferring Yukirin to NMB and NGT. Sometimes it's to put a girl into a position to get more exposure, like Miyawaki Sakura to AKB. Sometimes it works well, sometimes it doesn't.  As for big news, I'm sure you've heard about the attack on Kawaei and Iriyama. NGT48 is starting in Niigata with Kitahara Rie managing it. Sashihara transferred to HKT as manager and pretty much single handedly brought HKT popularity way up. Sashihara is by far the most desirable member when it comes to television contracts. In the latest London Hearts they polled TV producers and she consistently ranked in the top ten compared to all female television personalities. Nakagawa Haruka fully transferred to JKT and has secured regular positions on Indonesian tv, which is pretty amazing. There's also SNH in Shanghai, but I don't think they're doing too well. Finally, Nogizaka46 has surpassed all of the AKB sister groups with respect to sales. They had one member Ikoma in the elections last year and she made it to 11th and she is far from the most popular girl in Nogizaka so they are doing well. Those are the big things."
AKB48,30sgj0,neyev,1 point,Mon Mar 30 11:09:18 2015 UTC,"Sashihara still impress me. I remember she used to be the ""most normal member"" and how she managed to get popular between the second and third senbatsu, as well that I love her variety personality.  No, I didn't know about that attack, looked now. Thanks for all the information anyway!"
AKB48,30sgj0,ryuu_kujirai,1 point,Mon Mar 30 18:25:34 2015 UTC,"I think the most popular girls in nogizaka are between Nishino Nanase, Shiraishi Mai and Hashimoto Nanami, if you take the handshake slots to account. Ikoma isn't that popular imo."
AKB48,30sgj0,ryuu_kujirai,3,Tue Mar 31 04:27:45 2015 UTC,"She released a few singles here and there but the sales weren't as good as before, I'm not sure about her love life though. Mariko's business was closed for good about a year ago; Tomochin released a few other singles; not sure about Amina; Yuuko is a big star in dramas now - you should check out Zeni no Sensou; Erena released two singles and she sometimes is an extra in some dramas iirc; not sure about Kasai and Sayaka. Kennin was introduced for a couple of reasons: Officially is to let the members experience the different ways on how sister groups are running; but personally I think for Sayaka/Jurina/Sakura they were put into kennin so it wouldn't be weird if they are put as centers for AKB singles. Since you were mentioning about the graduates, maybe Kibouteki Refrain?      Couplings for Eien Pressure for the groups are nice and they represent the sister groups in a way AkiP intended them to be.  Also for starters try NMB's Teppen Tottande and their second album, also Team N's 3rd stage rocks!  For HKT, I like Sakura, Minna de Tabeta and Kidoku Through Seriously though, if you want to do a quick catch up, just start with Koko ni Ita Koto then 1830m then Tsugi no Ashiato then Koko ga Rhodes da, Koko de Tobe! that way you'll get the highlight from each preceding years.    What about Kitarie's assignment to be NGT's Captain and also Yukirin's kennin? AkiP won't let them graduate soon I guess."
AKB48,30sgj0,neyev,3,Mon Mar 30 12:40:02 2015 UTC,"/u/firelion also mentioned Mariko's business, now I understand why ""closed for good"". I'll check Yuuko's dramas.  Now I have better understanding on the Kennin thing, seeing how both Sayanee and Jurina have always been popular (and also about Sae/Miichan/Akicha).  Also, thanks for the other news, I'll check your reccomendations today."

The two ""problem"" clips (Kibouteki Refrain music video and a her show tomo paisen) is obviously her just wearing a bigger bra purely for fashion. Honestly, her personality has been villian-ized so much by the media but she is a hardworking girl. Since graduation, she has released singles, an album, a fragrance line, model work, etc. Busy girl."

AKB48,30o9pd,piyochama,1 point,Sun Mar 29 20:49:53 2015 UTC,exactly. Reports I heard from fans at the HS event said that she was looking pretty out of it and cold too (more than she usually is at HS's apparently) so... :( I'm wondering if her photobook and non-AKB activities (shes had a lot lately) have got her thinking about graduation. Gotta be coming up soon now that takamina is leaving :(
AKB48,30o9pd,Whitehexe,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:02:20 2015 UTC,Well takamina mentioned leaving after all of first gen leaves so

AKB48,30o9pd,piyochama,2,Mon Mar 30 00:54:44 2015 UTC,"She was also 27 yo when she graduated, Miichan is only 22 and worked so hard after her scandal. I don't think shes going to be around for MUCH longer, but I think she'll make it past December for sure."
AKB48,30o9pd,Whitehexe,2,Mon Mar 30 03:32:00 2015 UTC,what is going on with the 48 groups. that is a bunch of big names that aren't running this time around.
AKB48,30o9pd,firelion,2,Sun Mar 29 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"Well there's been a lot of graduations recently especially in SKE. Of the big names, kojiharu's been hinting at graduation for almost a year now, maybe this is her way of making way for newer members, although I heard someone speculate that she might just show up to the election to announce her graduation for the shock effect.  Ikoma had her kennin cancelled so while still eligible it's not that odd that she decided against competing especially considering that her kenning in akb has always been a somewhat contentious matter for some fans. Kawaei announced her graduation in the last few days, I wish her the best. I'm not too sure about Iriyama anna but she turned down a position on the 40th single senbatsu too but I don't really know much about her. Hopefully it doesn't have to do with the iwate incident.  As for Matsui Rena(disclaimer, huge fan of Rena here), her post mentioned a lot about improving and challenging herself and that there are a lot of ways for fans to support her other than the election. Although it may be true for a lot of the members she in particular has mentioned in the past that she never liked the elections and being compared to the other members.   Personally, with her experience and position in the 48group, I really don't think a high rank in the elections has much to offer her anymore and with the increasing amounts of solo work she's involved in recently, bowing out of the elections may give her more time and less stress to concentrate on other things. It could also be a chance for other members in ske to get a better ranking and further establish themselves, God knows SKE needs every pick me up it can get these days.  All in all I wouldn't be too worried, many of the big names that bowed out this time around were expected or at least not too surprising. While disappointing, especially in Kawaei's case, with 4 open spots in the senbatsu in a few more in undergirls I think this is going to be one exciting election."
AKB48,30o9pd,lordnoobs,2,Sun Mar 29 23:51:48 2015 UTC,When I heard about rena not running I thought it was because she was wanting to focus on her nogi kennin... but like a day or so after she announced her not running it was announced the kennin was cancelled... so I guess not. Established girls not running though makes sense how you said - lets newer girls get recognition and lets the established girls focus on other things.

The Japanese ""Idol culture"" is one that attracts more than its fair share of a certain kind of perverted people, which the industry itself seems to foster in a twisted symbiotic way.   Hopefully the girls that are affected can move past it."
AKB48,30h2bz,eehreum,-1,Fri Mar 27 11:14:03 2015 UTC,Frankly I'm just glad the girls are 100% victims in this.  The title was ambiguous.
AKB48,30h2bz,eehreum,-6,Fri Mar 27 12:26:05 2015 UTC,"The girls were anonymous, and ya it sucks for those girls part of that generation, but this sends a strong message to parents out there. Not to send their naive children out on pathetic missions of filial ambition.  Equip them with some awareness that perverts like this are out there and there's things you can do to safeguard yourself from being taken advantage of.  Like not laying down in a hotel room butt naked.  I mean it's supposed to be private, but having seen quite a few online videos I would say the last place you should be walking around naked as a celebrity is a hotel room."
AKB48,30h2bz,eehreum,18,Fri Mar 27 09:31:07 2015 UTC,"These videos were all taken in private places -- dressing rooms, bathrooms, hotel room(s). Are the girls supposed to stay fully clothed 24/7? Wear the same thing for the rest of their lives and never use the restroom?   A trusted authority figure violated their rights and privacy, there is no way you can blame the girls for not ""[safeguarding themselves] from being taken advantage of."""
AKB48,30h2bz,firelion,-8,Fri Mar 27 12:31:26 2015 UTC,"These were all taken in private places -- where a manager left his bag with a hidden camera in it.  And guess what.  There's probably a manager right now doing the same exact thing to some other celebrity given the amount of celebrities there are in Japan.   You think they wouldn't benefit from this knowledge?  You think girls won't ask a manager to remove his bag from the bathroom before they do their business?  Or a dressing room, or a hotel room?  No one here is blaming victims.  But now there's a precedent that allows for things like this to be more readily recognized, and people don't have to be naive to it."
AKB48,30h2bz,OdaijiNi,7,Fri Mar 27 13:37:12 2015 UTC,"Nodera [...] planted a camera inside a bathroom that was used by members. He also used cigarette lighters and pens to conceal camera equipment.   Unless the translated article missed something, there is zero mention of ""[leaving] his bag with a hidden camera in it,"" so I don't know where you got that piece of information. The manager hid the cameras in incredibly innocuous places. I doubt a bag with recording equipment would have gone unnoticed in, say, a bathroom, as mentioned in the article. This guy knew what he was doing. What exactly are the girls supposed to do, demand for all pens in a hotel room to be removed?    ""No one here is blaming victims.""  ""there's things you can do to safeguard yourself from being taken advantage of. Like not laying down in a hotel room butt naked.""   There's some incongruity there.  If cameras can be hidden in pens, surely they can be hidden anywhere that would be safe for one to be ""butt naked,"" whether that is a hotel room, a changing room, a bathroom, etc. etc. Once again, it is not the girls' prerogative to somehow magically be aware of these tiny hidden cameras, and I sure as hell hope the justice system makes a harsh example of this manager (though I doubt it)."

Kinda like they're trying to make her like sashi.  I love riichan I wonder why she's graduating so early   Edit:   I saw someone ask on stage48 if this meant ikoma's kennin was cancelled. I really hope not.  Also, I'm really sad that this means Fuu-chan's kennin position has ended too! Seems like they're trying to push Miru over Fuuko (Rashikunai centers). I wonder how Rena will feel not doing Nogi work? I wonder if she wanted this or if this just confused her. Hope this didn't mess up things for her :(. Glad Tomu is back in K..

It's such a shame that someone that just made top 16 is forced to graduate due to the rash actions of a selfish individual. My main concern with her graduation is that i feel she hasn't been able to garner as large of a fan base through akb nor has she been given the amount of exposure/experience that other more prominent graduates have had ( like acchan or yuko). Well regardless what happens, i wish her the best in her life outside of akb."

AKB48,306tcu,piyochama,0,Wed Mar 25 03:36:09 2015 UTC,They made such a big fuss about Shige being back and then put her in the back... HKT Management what are you doing??? You have an asset in her stop trying to hold her back. They need to learn to take risks and see where it gets them... Other then that the song is cute and the outfits are adorable.
AKB48,306tcu,BurntJoint,0,Wed Mar 25 02:11:19 2015 UTC,They made a big fuss about Shige because they're effectively letting slide the fact that she broke the law (which in Jent usually means a death sentence for your career)

AKB48,306tcu,piyochama,1 point,Wed Mar 25 09:08:15 2015 UTC,"No, there are actual curfew laws (more precisely by-laws) for minors in many areas of Japan (I'm not sure if it applied to Murashige's case). The age and time and existence of the law varies between city and prefecture. In some cities, just access to certain establishments like arcades and movie theatres are restricted, sometimes it is being outside without an adult that is restricted. Of course, actual enforcement of these laws is another story."

AKB48,306tcu,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Wed Mar 25 08:54:11 2015 UTC,"It's not about taking risks, it's the fact that if you have done something embarrassing in Japan, you have to prove yourself that you're able to get up without having any push whatsoever. This is HKT where Sasshi is. If she can do it, why Murashige can't? Just believe in and keep supporting her I guess, complaining won't help at this point."
AKB48,307evt,iupecam,3,Wed Mar 25 01:52:34 2015 UTC,It depends on the single you're talking about. Are you talking about the upcoming one?

AKB48,307evt,g0cchin,2,Wed Mar 25 11:07:45 2015 UTC,"It has a different cover photo and a handshake ticket. Secondary tracks and DVD contents may also vary, just like between Type A/K/B.  When it comes to the sousenkyo single, both the regular and limited has a voting ticket.  I suppose you could sell or give away the handshake ticket if you don't live in Japan if you really wanted the Limited Edition."

I'm actually pretty gutted. Rena is one of my favourites and I love seeing her in senbatsu singles. Love Rena :( I hope this decision doesn't hurt you in the long run.

AKB48,3045ad,Lamiington,1 point,Tue Mar 24 11:47:20 2015 UTC,She barely appeared for the last single promotional events though. Is it really worth having her in senbatsu when she's never there?
AKB48,3045ad,piyochama,1 point,Wed Mar 25 00:15:58 2015 UTC,This is really surprising. Is she really busy with her own projects or something? Missing out on the election is a pretty huge thing.

AKB48,3045ad,piyochama,3,Wed Mar 25 00:16:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly out of ALL the girls to not participate, this was really surprising to me. However, I realize that Rena has a lot of work  (ex. Majisuka Gakuen stageplay, seiyuu work for an upcoming anime) that was given to her over the past few months that if she even participates in the election, it's literally overkill.   Seeing this, a lot of SKE votes will probably spread to more members. So it gives me better hope that more SKE members will probably rank or make it to Senbatsu.   with tani marika being one of rena's favorites back when she was in hkt...this gives me some hope. D:"

AKB48,3045ad,firelion,2,Tue Mar 24 11:45:03 2015 UTC,"I was sad at first. I figured that she had thought about it for a long time, and her blog post reassured me of that. So even though I'd like her to participate, I support her decision not to.  It's good news for Jurina, though, as far as the rankings are concerned. I'll be surprised if she doesn't make Top 3 this year. It might help other SKE members and Ikoma, as well."

This is just speculation though.  She could also just need a break, as from what I've gathered she has been very busy lately. It is sad, but hopefully it will help other SKE members out in the elections and make her own life a little less stressful."
AKB48,3045ad,RedRebel915,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:22:48 2015 UTC,"I was definitely caught off guard about this, as it seems like a step closer towards graduation and the fact that SKE hasn't exactly been stable these past few months. But after skimming through her blog post explaining things, I can totally understand why she decided not to participate. I really wonder how SKE is going to do this year in the election though. It'll be interesting to see if/how this affects the upper ranks of Jurina, Suda Akari, Sae, Shibata Aya (or even Matsumura Kaori) and has any ripple effects for younger members like Ryoha or Ami."

AKB48,2z6j7u,RinaLuvsPandas,5,Mon Mar 16 00:40:16 2015 UTC,"Many people have replied from 48's perspective, so i'll try writing one from 46's. Nogizaka is still small, with 30~ active member at the moment. They are all talented and each of them are unique, and bless the system where Nogizaka senbatsu can change anytime.  Most of them did a good job at finding jobs, with some are contracted as a magazine model or find them self as an actress. Heck, Shinuchi Mai even worked part time as a office lady.  Ikoma Rina didn't even sell a slot in Inochi wa Utsukushii's HS, despite being the face of Nogizaka. She pretty much sacrificed her self to carry Nogizaka behind her back, agreeing to kennin to AKB to help promoting Nogizaka and yet she still didn't sell well.  Life sucks and unfair, not just to us but also to a bunch of talented young girls in 48 and 46."
AKB48,2z6j7u,toomuchidea,3,Tue Mar 17 07:33:16 2015 UTC,"Shinuchi Mai is still an OL, IIRC. A lot of artists in Japan actually do part time work, as confirmed through various interviews (the latest one that I remember is with Pour Lui of BiS)"
AKB48,2z6j7u,piyochama,3,Tue Mar 17 13:39:19 2015 UTC,"cmiiw but she graduated from college, apply for OL, accepted and thus worked as one all while she's doing Nogizaka activities. She's working both job, that's why people call her OL kennin"
AKB48,2z6j7u,toomuchidea,10,Wed Mar 18 06:01:24 2015 UTC,"TLDR; Yeah it sucks, but I think it's more of a growing up/entertainment industry thing than a 48G specific thing.  I'm torn on this topic, to be honest.   The ""world"" of AKB48 is filled with ups and downs. On one hand I feel like these girls are some of the most validated people on the planet. You only have to watch a seitansai performance to see that. People form ""birthday committees"" to figure out how they're going to best help the member celebrate their birthday. Don't even get me started on graduation performances, since they're both validating and sad at the same time. Members say so much themselves -- they talk about the fans' support being their energy. That support is validation.  Of course, as you say -- these people are pre-teens, teenagers and young adults. People in their early 20s or below are very rarely models of being comfortable in their own skin. I know I wasn't, and even to some extent, I'm still not even though I'm in my 30s. I think most of these girls would be insecure even if they weren't in show business. It just wouldn't be broadcast the way it is here, and that may very well amplify their effects.  You see, that's the problem that leads these girls to having these thoughts and reactions. When you look to the external for proof of your own worth, it's a recipe for insecurity. On a certain level, in the entertainment industry, how well liked you are is literally your self worth. While a certain amount of social skills are required to achieve a high level of success in most careers, AKB48 is probably one of the most direct correlations between how well liked you are and how popular you are.  In the end, yeah, I hate that these girls are insecure about themselves even though they're a pretty big source of joy for me. I'm also not defending the filming of gratuitous crying we see well, everywhere. At the same time, I don't think their emotional position is that unique, and I don't feel they're any more deserving of empathy than anyone else. Don't interpret that to mean I think they do not deserve empathy by any means. I wouldn't be listening to any of 48G if it weren't for the members.   That being said, I also think the imperfections to which we are privy are part of the reason why I enjoy AKB48 as much as I do, especially compared to other idol groups. I think it makes them feel a bit more real since you get a much better idea of their personality compared to most other celebrities."
AKB48,2z6j7u,kagayaki,4,Mon Mar 16 05:59:35 2015 UTC,"As a now 20 year old (just turned 20 on the 9th) I can understand where you are coming from but I think people forget how lonely being an idol can be. Acchan suffered from depression. Miichan thinks she isn't good enough and that she never will be. Do people not realize the long term effects that this can have on them? The real question is, does anyone care?  This isn't okay. They shouldn't feel like this. Its an awful feeling and worries me how it effects the 11/12 year olds in the group."
AKB48,2z6j7u,kagayaki,7,Mon Mar 16 08:16:41 2015 UTC,".. I think people forget how lonely being an idol can be.   Ultimately, loneliness is a state of mind. There's nothing objective about ""being lonely,"" although I can understand why the position can be isolating, especially for those who have been around a while.  As far as I'm aware, you almost ""live"" with your fellow KKSes while you are in training. I think this is a large reason why those from the same generation seem to generally have good friendships.  This seems the opposite of lonely to me.  This is why I specifically mention I see how it may be hard for those who have been around a long time, since the members with whom they grew up are no longer with them. That definitely sucks.  At the same time, they also have juniors who they can help mentor. I've heard it said a lot that helping other people can help you see outisde of yourself, and in that way it stops you from ruminating on your own problems.   Acchan suffered from depression. Miichan thinks she isn't good enough and that she never will be.   I guess I'm not really sure what you're ""looking for."" Are you suggesting that AKB48 is an overall negative influence for these girls? Do you think they would be better off if they never became an idol? I will only reiterate that while I agree these girls do deserve love and empathy, there's nothing unique about their situation that makes them more deserving than anyone else.   The real question is, does anyone care? This isn't okay.    These girls are not victims so please stop trying to frame them as such. Of course people care, whether it's fans, fellow members or staff.. I think most of these girl's support structures are probably better than most normal people."
AKB48,2z6j7u,gtazn,0,Mon Mar 16 23:07:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying AKB is a negative place, you guys are taking bits and pieces of what I'm saying and trying to twist it up. There are plenty of people who are struggling in AKB or to shine that is where I'm getting at."
AKB48,2z6j7u,gtazn,5,Tue Mar 17 00:20:05 2015 UTC,"So many amazing preteens/teenagers/young adults who think they aren't good enough when they are perfect.   ...   They aren't perfect...   What now? :p  Anyway, life is a rollercoaster and life is unfair. The girls are young, vulnerable and emotional, so they will inevitably shed a lot of tears. However, tears aren't all bad. The tears you see these girls shed are often of happiness or gratitude. I'd cry too if I got back into senbatsu after a scandal, or if I was just announced for my first center position in an upcoming single. Hell, even the bad tears could lead to growth and a better path. Sato Sumire collapsed on stage after being transferred to Team E, but now she’s made heaps of new friends, is a regular in SKE’s senbatsu, and even centered a B-side on Kibouteki Refrain.  Like everyone else that posts here, I love these girls. However, like /u/kagayaki, I don’t feel they’re more deserving of empathy than anyone else. Being under the 48 group banner, these girls are in a position of privilege. AKB48 are on top of the mountain. These girls are protected, and they’re getting paid. I don’t know much about Jpop idols outside of the 48 groups, but I’ve also been a long time Kpop fan. Idols in Korea are indebted to their agencies for their training, living expenses, etc., and have to pay all that back after debut before they even make a single cent themselves. A large amount of Korean idols don’t even become successful enough to pay back their agencies, and end up being in the red after their group disbands. So with knowing the struggles of lessor known idol groups, even simply being a 48 group theatre girl looks good, right?   How many of them are suffering by themselves?   I’d guess not many, if any. These girls aren’t lonely. They have many colleagues who would be in the same position, or many supportive seniors who have been through it all before. A lot of them even still live with their families. With the 48 groups being at the top, they also have a massive army of fans supporting them and giving them a lift. They apologize for being sick, making mistakes, etc. simply out of courtesy. No true fan would demand apologies, and no true fan would expect them to be perfect. Quite a few of these girls wouldn’t be as popular as they are without certain quirks or “imperfections”.  Miichan has legitimate worries about life post-AKB, and Acchan did suffer from depression. However, these are concerns that have nothing to do with the 11/12 year olds. They’re at the very beginning of their idol lives, and will have very little pressure put upon them. Jurina was the only 11/12 year old that has had to endure anything close to the pressure that Acchan had to endure, but she is an isolated case."

I understand where you're coming from but again some of these are kids who are balancing school, training, and performances. It can't be easy and even with people they can talk to it must be hard. What about school? Not grade wise but social wise. I think I read somewhere that Sakura lost a lot of her friends because of her schedule. I think there are a lot of things people overlook at AKB and try to find logic reasoning for it or try to rationalize it. Even Miichan's mental breakdown after her scandal is thought of as a joke? She shaved her head. Its the same thing that made Brittney Spears get help but people joke around it."
AKB48,2z6j7u,gtazn,5,Mon Mar 16 11:39:15 2015 UTC,"Of course it's hard balancing school, life and idol work. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. However, I'm sure these girls know full well what they're signing up for. They could easily wait until they finish school before auditioning, but they're willing to sacrifice and go through tough times in order to fulfil their dreams. They're giving up on having a regular teenage life, but I bet thousands of others their age would kill to be in their position (idols outside of the 48 groups included)."

AKB48,2x193n,hachiagejo,0,Tue Feb 24 21:26:34 2015 UTC,"This is awesome! It's so nice when they actually do something different or interesting with singles. It's just a shame about that awful ""band"" they have making the instrumental. What might that be, the stock sound set on Fruity Loops or something? How hard would it have been to go to a practice studio and hire 3 or 4 guys to record this with real instruments?"
AKB48,2wzwgl,violeblanche,2,Tue Feb 24 15:32:10 2015 UTC,"They use a picture of SKE48 for AKB48, understandable mistake though.  They did well with everything else. I feel with the amount of information left out each of those groups could have easily had there own video, a bit like Babymetal. The reacts wont be as polarizing as Babymetal or Kyary which is why I'm guessing they did it this way instead."
AKB48,2wzwgl,Zarzen,2,Tue Feb 24 18:44:47 2015 UTC,"They did a Youtubers react episode for Babymemtal. It was actually a lot more well received than that one.  There were a couple bad reactions that were effectively ""what have they done to my metal?!,"" but most of them either thought the concept was hilarious or actually liked it.  I remember seeing some vlog from the guys who run the React channel talking about how they had plans do something with Babymetal in the future, but I don't follow the channel enough to know anything about what that actually was.  Especially when it comes to western fans being exposed to jpop, there's little in my experience that's as polarizing (in a bad way) as AKB48."
AKB48,2wzwgl,kagayaki,2,Tue Feb 24 23:39:09 2015 UTC,"They also did a Kids React to PONPONPON. The reactions were, unsurprisingly, kind of polarizing like you said."

I was just saying they did those in their own video because it's unsurprisingly polarizing. While at the same time each of the artists featured in this could have the same result in a video of their own. It just not as obvious or as easy."
AKB48,2wtbyo,fierce_glare,8,Mon Feb 23 00:02:43 2015 UTC,"I felt it after they released Heart Eleki, but definitely after the sousenkyo single it felt like akb48 was going downhill. To me it felt like a song that could barely be seen as a b-side. The whole idea of them kinda trying to stir up a rivalry between sasshi and mayu felt really forced as you could tell they tried to replicate the same type of video and ""inclusive"" theme that Koisuru Fortune Cookie had going on. But it seems much better now, Green Flash is probably one of my most listened to songs atm and I feel that this style of idol song is rather refreshing when compared to kibouteki refrain or those other singles they pumped out prior to this. Then again, people might have loved those singles, but they didn't click with me."
AKB48,2wtbyo,4ceTheAznInvazn,1 point,Mon Feb 23 02:52:36 2015 UTC,"You summed it up perfectly. I absolutely agree. Something about Heart Eleki is definitely the moment where things started to seem a bit weak with them. In no way does that mean all of their songs have been not so good, but just the singles in general have been lacking. I haven't got the chance to listen to Green Flash much, but it already seems to be the strongest singles. I think like all groups that are around for a long time, they go through little ruts, but it's something they bounce back from!"
AKB48,2wtbyo,OdaijiNi,4,Mon Feb 23 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"I don't really get this attitude.   Perhaps my perspective of AKB48 (or really 48G) is different from most. The ""vibe"" (is that the right word? not sure) of the group is definitely changing since many people are graduating, although I feel like SKE48 is getting the brunt of that. None that I consider my oshis have announced their graduation yet, but I've lost count how many people whom I really like are graduating (I watched Yamada Mizuho's final performance last night :/). At least one of my favorites (Kizaki Yuria) has confirmed that she has no plans on graduating anytime soon.   That being said, I do feel a little ho-hum about SKE48 lately. I enjoy watching theater performance LODs and it's getting really difficult for me to watch them simply because I have seen S3, KII 3 and Te wo Tsunaginagara SOOOO many times. Recent AKB48 LODs feel fresh to me even though their stages are just as old since I didn't really pay attention to groups besides SKE48 until the grand shuffle last year. Lately I've made it through more Team A and Team 4 LODs than Team S or Team E. Not that I consider that a bad thing; Team A and Team 4 are great. I just wish Yuria would do more performances with 4.  If anything, I feel that's the biggest improvement to make -- new stages please.  I also can't count Suzukake or Heart Ereki too low because Escape and Seijun Philosophy came from those singles, which are two of my favorite songs. I almost always ignore the A-sides and listen to the singles for the coupling tracks since they're pretty much always better than the A-side. From that respect, Kibouteki Refrain is great. The A-side was fine, if a bit bland, but I like most of the coupling tracks that came with it. Very reminiscent of Sayonara Crawl. I feel like most people wrote SC off since the A-side was pretty boring. But the coupling tracks were some of the best I've heard in recent memory.  I guess that's kind of the thing. I've been into 48 Group in some form another for a few years now and I don't think there's any one that's really made me worried about the group as a whole. If anything that which made me the most nervous was SKE48's mass graduation (which still feels like it's going on, especially over the last few months) and then the grand shuffle, but I think that made me worried more about SKE48 specifically than 48G in general."

Luckily I have a large selection of songs that I've never heard before to choose from, so Uza and Beginner saved my day :D are there any other 48 songs that are a bit darker and more powerful like these 2?"

He can be very very good, but some of the songs are clearly lightweight.  The music is written by a variety of people.  I would say the choreography is the weakest part of the enterprise;  rather simple and repetitive.     On the other hand, the simple choreography is part of what let Koi Suru Fortune Cookie become such a viral success."
AKB48,2wtbyo,effectivecatch,1 point,Tue Feb 24 23:12:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know how you guys can single out Heart Eleki. At least it has a theme, an image, and is memorable, whether or not you like the song. What about garbage singles like Labrador Retriever or Suzukake... ?  I don't think AKB is losing steam in any noticeable way. If it is, it's probably a gradual thing. For example, after Oshima Yuko graduated, it hasn't been the same group. But, there are lots of upcoming new girls, so it's different now. I think it's hard to say whether or not it's losing steam."
AKB48,2wn5eg,leopold_s,13,Sat Feb 21 09:22:26 2015 UTC,"They were marketed as the ""official rivals of AKB"". Their name resembles that of an AKB group, and they are also based in Tokyo, like AKB. They are also under different record labels but have the same producer (Akimoto Yasushi). That's basically it.  Lately, Nogizaka singles have risen in sales to overtake all of the AKB sister groups. Though the sales no where near match AKB, perhaps they are gradually becoming worthy of the term ""rival"". Also, there has been a lot of collaborative works between them recently. Some say this kind of undermines the rivalry, but they often also have gimmicky events that play up on the idea of this rivalry.  In the end it's simply a marketing tactic to give the public something to remember them by."
AKB48,2wn5eg,neyev,1 point,Sat Feb 21 09:36:55 2015 UTC,"In the end it's simply a marketing tactic to give the public something to remember them by.   Hm, yeah, I got that part, was just wondering in what way the ""rivalry"" is played out. I.e., is there any animosity between fans of AKB48 and NGZK46? Do the bands diss each other? Probably not. Or is it just a competition who sells the most records?"
AKB48,2wn5eg,neyev,9,Sat Feb 21 10:29:37 2015 UTC,"NGZK and AKB actually pretty rarely meet each other on TV shows (though that's been increasing recently). But when they do, the rivalry kind of gets played up. There have been some competitions between them in AKBINGO for example. On variety shows people often make jokes like: ""Who's my AKB oshimen? Oh, I like Nogi better."" or things like that. There doesn't seem to be any animosity between the two groups. Though there seems to have been some tension within Nogizaka when Ikoma was transfered to AKB. Hard to tell if it's just to keep up with public image or if any of the members actually care. Fans pretty often compare the two (example). Many Nogi fans dislike the SKE-transfer Matsui Rena and to a lesser extent Ikoma, so fans are surely buying into this rivalry business. Also, last election Ikoma was kind of the Nogi representative and she got into senbatsu. She got some hate for that but for the most part AKB fans in general don't really care about Nogi."

AKB48,2wn5eg,KiraKiraHanabi,2,Sun Feb 22 02:27:18 2015 UTC,"I think for the most part, the reason AKB fans don't care about Nogi is because they didn't have a reason to. They were marketed as the rival to AKB with their first single, and sold not even 1/10th of what AKB did, and their second single barely beat Sasshi, pretty much winning it on technicalities.  However, now that Nogi has risen, some of the attitude of rivalry is coming in to play, and I feel like a lot of these collaborations (Ikoma and Rena transfers, Mayuzaka/Kojizaka/Sasshizaka) are an effort to make them closer to each other and try and get them to get closer to make the ""friendly rivalry"" idea stronger between them, and also introduce AKB fans who may not care to faces that they might be seeing soon."
AKB48,2wn5eg,skinnedsin,3,Sat Feb 21 22:19:29 2015 UTC,"From someone who follows NGZ46 and doesn't care for AKB48 as much, the big appeal for me is how much different NGZ46 is in appearance.  I get the feeling that a lot of j-pop listeners are put off by AKB48's 'fanservice' and 'weird songs.'  NGZ46 has a 'cooler' and more 'pure' aura, they hardly ever do fan service, and their songs have a lot more of a relatable sound.  I think NGZ46 caters to their female fans just as much, if not more, than their otaku fans.  It also appeals to girls who want to be an idol, but don't necessarily want to be do as much fan service as the other 48 groups do."

They're what I would consider the lesser reaction to Kpop from Japanese music (the other is Fairies, who I like, but still understand that they're another form of a reaction to Kpop). Quite frankly, I think its just the EXILE appeal (they can dance really well! and make really same-sounding music that still appeals to people!) that rubs off on E-Girls.   Musically, Momoclo has heaps and mountains over E-Girls for me, but from what I understand, E-Girls is the more popular group among girls overall."

JKT48 NEWS:   Happy birthday to JKT48 3rd Generation Trainee's Rizka Khalila a.k.a. Yukka! NOTTV'S AKB48 no Anta Dare will shoot an episode at JKT48 theater! Apparently, Yuasa came to Jakarta with the members. Maybe there will be an announcement involving AKB48? Another transfer? Miichan is sick and will not perform at the joint concert.     Just to give you an update about the state of JKT48:   Theater attendance is good. Especially with Team J performing Boku no Taiyou (Team KIII's first setlist), I even lost 4 Enpou slots for Team J's BnT, even though usually at this month it's a sure-win. Yesterday, AKB48 no Anta Dare shot an episode at JKT48 theater. Can't enter (not Official Fan Club member), feel sad. From my observation, 3rd Gen KKS Sofia and Cia leads in popularity. Might be the first to be promoted after Team T formation. No sign of reshuffle yet.     Ah, also, Yuihan said that she will exercise her soukantoku powers to lobby Aki-P for JKT48 original single. Good girl! We owe you if it happens.  Aaya (who is graduating soon) and Ryoochan approves Indonesian instant noodles. They kick ass.  Even Mr. Yuasa likes Indonesian food. Can't stop eating.  Michelle (Team T) is quite popular between AKB48 members."
AKB48,2weizc,piyochama,6,Thu Feb 19 06:02:52 2015 UTC,"So the SKE48 graduation wave appears to have stopped (for now). I think many of the announcements were understandable, but Yamada Mizuho and Iwanaga Tsugumi were pretty surprising to me (and apparently many other people on Stage48) as both seemed to be rising stars within SKE.   While the reason for the older members to graduate goes without saying, I had no idea about the apparent ""audition ban"" SKE has that might have been another reason for younger members with potential to graduate. As far as I understand, it essentially limits the amount of outside work SKE members have. This, plus rumors about the possibility of SKE downsizing to only Team S make me really concerned with SKE's future. Hopefully Yuasa can help fix things in Nagoya soon.   Oh and SKSubs subbed some funny segments from SKE's Tokai Radio show 1+1 is not 2 with Iwanaga Tsugumi and Tani Marika that I thought were pretty fun to watch if you have some free time!  Iwanaga Tsugumi with Ichino Narumi, Umemoto Madoka, and Koishi Kumiko  Iwanaga Tsugumi & Miyamae Ami  Tani Marika & Umemoto Madoka"

My thoughts: The song is great and very upbeat. The PV is beautifully shot. It feels like this single is meant to symbolize a turning point in AKB. This song has an R&B beat distinct from past AKB singles. The PV does not feature, the ""centers"", like previous singles. A ""Green Flash"" is a phenomenon that occurs at sunrise or sunset, marking a transition point. The girls pushed as ""next generation"" are heavily featured, and the older aces are the ones wearing green. I don't think this means AKB48 is going to have major changes soon though. It's just an interesting concept.  Also, I'm really glad Iriyama was in this PV. Honestly hard to say she would have been in it without the incident. Owada Nana would have definitely replaced her given recent trends. I also like that Kojimako got a position. I don't like, however, that Minegishi didn't get a position."

AKB48,2w3ynu,Onimarr,2,Mon Feb 16 20:52:31 2015 UTC,I'm really liking this single. It doesn't feel like one of those generic idol songs they've been pumping out recently which is a nice change. Feels more like one of those chill jpop songs you'd hear on the radio.

AKB48,2vmfus,kagayaki,3,Thu Feb 12 05:18:05 2015 UTC,"For me it's too predictable.  And apparently Four Heavenly Queen is like Four Weakling Queen, which makes Maji-jo the weakling school if any transfer student can just go and beat up 3 out of 4 Queen. I hope Otabe can beat Sakura down, and then Sakura goes training or some shit and then go challenge the 4 Queen again.   The current story is too linear for me.  Well since this is the 5th episode out of normally 12 episode for Jdrama, I still have high hope for Majisuka Gakuen."
AKB48,2vmfus,kei_katsuga,2,Fri Feb 13 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"It's definitely very linear, although S1 & 2 were just about as predictable. S3 was pretty predictable as well in terms of the fights, although there was a nice plot twist at the end. I feel like Atsuko's closest call in a fight during her time during Majisuka Gakuen before Sado was her fight against Manamam, Myao and Lovetan where she got herself handcuffed to a jungle gym. It was one of the few times where she actually needed the help she received.  I don't believe Atsuko ever really lost a fight either.  I agree about the FHQ's. As I said in my OP, I did like Magic's concept a lot, and I don't think the writers did justice to that concept. I think what I really dislike about Sakura's fighting style is that she doesn't really have one. At some point it feels like she just outlasts her opponent long enough to deal the knock out blow. It might make sense if she was maybe 20lbs heavier and taller, but her ability to take a punch (especially in the Bakamono episode) is getting a bit old. Magic's fighting style reminds me a bit of Black's (Kashiwagi Yuki's in S1), and they could have done a lot more with that than they did. I guess her fighting style isn't that different from Maeda's character but I enjoyed Maeda's fights better so far.  But yeah, I hope the story gets more interesting as time goes on."
AKB48,2vmfus,GentlemanlyOctopus,2,Sat Feb 14 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm still disappointed by Otabe's change in personality, and the continuity in general.   Besides that, I really don't like Miyawaki as the protagonist. I never really cared for Acchan much, but it made sense that she was cast as the protag. It feels like they're trying to make Miyawaki into Atsuko 2.0, and it ain't working.  And for a very petty reason: She walks too weird. She has her knuckles pointing forward and doesn't move her arms at all. I can honestly say I've never seen anyone walk like that."

It just feels like they are adding more faceless names to an already huge crowd. Did any of them even get ranked in Sousenkyo?
AKB48,2thwff,RinaLuvsPandas,4,Sat Jan 24 16:13:02 2015 UTC,"just feels like they are adding more faceless names to an already huge crowd.   I don't think that's endemic of the draft system though. That can be said about most members for whom you have no interest. I'm much more of a SKE48 fan than I am anything else, and I couldn't comment on all of the 6th gen KKS and they've been around longer than the draft members. I honestly couldn't even comment too much on most of the senbatsu members besides maybe WMatsui or Suda Akari.  I at least know the face of most of the SKE48 draft members and I know a couple from AKB48 (thanks to a special on them myaidol subbed), but I would say they're fine. It's too early to say whether or not they'll be popular as dnagi says, although I don't see any of them becoming the next Sasshi, Takamina or whatever 48G pillar you want to name. I especially like Koishi Kumiko and Souda Sarina. I never particularly enjoyed Kodoku na Ballerina until Souda starting centering it. I'm not sure why, but I never liked Shawako that much.   That being said, the rest of the SKE48 draft members aren't very unique. None of them have gone through the impressive transformation that Kitagawa Ryoha went through as a nervous wreck on stage to the point of the performances being cringe worthy awkward to being pretty damn good. Of course, none of them were quite as bad as Ryoha was either, so I'm not really saying that as a diss to the draft members. I doubt you would know much about Ryoha's progression unless you follow SKE48 pretty closely and watch stage performances.   Are the draft members bad? Not at all, especially not for how relatively new they still are. They have good chemistry during stage performances with their teams and IMO, that's the most important part."

AKB48,2t2od5,akbzine,3,Tue Jan 20 18:19:24 2015 UTC,Yesterday I had one that was in a mix of broken English and Japanese.   I was in a hotel with several friends and Shibuya Nagisa was the clerk. She had us do some Liar Game/Saw type of game in which we had to go to different rooms of the hotel searching for a Pepsi machine. We had to find elaborate ways of getting into the rooms and past the tenants.  I don't remember much else and didn't get very far into the hotel.  That was the only one I've had that I remember at least.
AKB48,2t2od5,Zarzen,1 point,Tue Jan 20 21:48:52 2015 UTC,"That's funny -- sounds a bit like a video game with a Pepsi buy-in.  On a slightly related note, I looove Liar Game! I'd totally fail at every game though, lol."
AKB48,2t2od5,MalusRegis,3,Wed Jan 21 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"I think I've had 9-10 dreams involving different members (Yuko, Yui, Mayuyu, Yukirin, Churi, and Nao, to name a few). Like you mentioned, I've also noticed that they're more common after watching 48G stuff before I fall asleep. As weird as it sounds, after I wake up from one of those dreams I try to write down what happened on my phone, so I guess I have a (somewhat detailed) record of all the ones I've had so far. Makes for an interesting read once in a while.   I guess it might be weird/boring to explain all of them in detail, but whether it's defending and evacuating other members from a building with Kashiwagi Yuki, helping Churi make spaghetti for some little kids, or having Furuhata Nao popping up and teaching me Japanese before we both enter a survival game as partners, those usually end up being some really awesome dreams."

Sometimes I'll completely forget about a dream, and then remember it again when I read over my journal.  So, you're definitely right that it makes for an interesting read sometimes.  I'm jealous that you have so many 48 dreams!  I've only had this one so far (that I remember at least).  And you've definitely had some interesting ones :)"

As LetiBT mentions, there are definitely variations. There are 3-4 different entries for Iiwake Maybe (1 for stage, 1 for single, and its translations for SNH48 and JKT48) for example.   It starts adding up VERY quickly once you start looking at theater performances. Unless they're waiting stages, they usually use original songs in there. There are exceptions to that of course, such as Oogoe Diamond, Iiwake Maybe, Single Medley of KII 3 and Kuchiutsushi no Chocolate to name a few.

AKB48,2s6u0w,kagayaki,2,Tue Jan 13 05:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, looks like it. I never watched MG so after I watched the first episode of S4 (and really enjoyed it), I marathoned the first 3 seasons. S3 is probably the most detached from whatever ""story arc"" Majisuka Gakuen may be following, if for no other reason than that one took place in a prison.  There's not a whole lot you can tell from that first episode of S4, but nearly all of the members in previous seasons seem to be playing different characters in the current one. Kizaki Yuria was Peace in S3, Magic in S4 and seemed to have absolutely no interest in card tricks while in S3. Paruru played ""Paru"" in S3 and reminded me a lot of Maeda's character in S1 in her overall demeanor; I definitely can't see Salt saying something like ""Keita was my everything"" like she does in S3. Yogi (Iriyama Anna) reminds me much more of Akimoto Sayaka's character in S1-2 than Annin which she played in S3. And while Nanashi (Kawaei Rina in S3) wasn't considered the smartest person, Bakamono definitely takes it to a whole 'nother level.  Hell, even the fighting style of NyanNyan doesn't seem that similar to how she fought in S1-2. Otabe/Yuihan seems A LOT more hot headed in the current season than she was in S2; she was probably only second to Nezumi in level headedness in S2. Maybe she's just real sensitive about being held back, but overall there doesn't seem to be much carried over from S1-2 besides perhaps the legacies of Maeda and Yuko.  So, in the end, I think the only things which really connect the different seasons is that they're all about being ""maji."""
AKB48,2s6u0w,GentlemanlyOctopus,1 point,Sun Jan 18 20:35:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seemed like season two was supposed to be the last, or at the very least that that particular story was done and they weren't sure where to take it.  I would say that the most telling evidence that S3 was ignored is that despite 4 of Rapapa's members being in that prison, none of them seem to care about the others at all.  I really do hope that Yui's change in demeanor is explained, or that it was just a one time thing. Because it'll be very disappointing otherwise."
AKB48,2s6u0w,GentlemanlyOctopus,2,Sun Jan 18 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"Well Staff-san praised her for her role in MG3.  Let's not forget she was the one who made it through the final round of the recent audition (incl. other members such as Annin, Kawaei, Komari, Yukirin, Tanamin, Tanochan, Rena), chosen by Nakata Hideo himself (producer of the The Ring).  Being minimalistic doesn't mean she doesn't care about it.  Paru kinda explained it in the recently subbed Majisuka Gakuen special episode of AKBINGO.  She also got a role in a mini horror story last year. The vid itself is kinda cheesy but Paru's facial expressions are great.   Sasoi no Mori"

I know it sounds weird because she acts really carefree and stupid now. She's actually been praised and hinted by multiple members (Miichan, Tomochin, Yuko) as being really smart. There's also all the times she's done the Mecha-ike test and her answers have always been like 75% correct but somehow turned hilariously wrong by a mistake. I also remember reading somewhere that Yuko once put up a bunch of difficult math problems during a PV filming and Kojiharu just came and solved them with ease. She also has a ridiculous win rate in Janken Taikai and I really believe that it's not luck, but her reading the other members like a book.  I never really thought about it until one day when I randomly thought her position in AKB. I mean think about it this way, she works weekly with a very prominent comedian (Ariyoshi), according to magazines she's always has been 5 top in income, commercials, female idol liked by females, etc. But the kicker is because she's always hovering around 6-9 in the sousenkyo, she's not a prominent target for AKB antis or other member's oshi fanwars. Also she can do absolutely anything she wants because she's the biggest senpai in AKB, but she's not a captain or management or a ace/center so she doesn't need to be a role model or anything of the sort. She somehow put herself into the most perfect situation without any pressure."

And apart from DOKKIRI shows (which I really like) AKB48G shows is pretty much all I watch too :) EVERY ONE CAN KNOW, I DON'T CARE :) !!"
AKB48,2qyl2y,NavARXIDA,6,Thu Jan 1 15:59:25 2015 UTC,"I started getting in to AKB around the end of 2012, watching AKBingo episodes and stuff.  The whole time i thought that Jurina was 22-24 years old and I only found out that she wasn't that old about a year ago. I'm still in shock."
AKB48,2qyl2y,Kyle6Flukey,2,Sat Jan 3 03:36:25 2015 UTC,You must have only seen the newer episodes because in one the early ones (like <50) they have her on a few times and make fun of how young she is and how she still wets the bed.
AKB48,2qyl2y,BurntJoint,2,Thu Jan 1 05:54:13 2015 UTC,Yeah i only just started to watch those ones a month ago.   I'd been watching the ones between 100-200 i'd say.
AKB48,2qyl2y,Kyle6Flukey,4,Thu Jan 1 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah i did the same thing.   In case you didnt know already, you can watch pretty much all of them subbed on this channel.  There were also 2 prequal shows before AKBingo as well [Show 1, Show 2]"
AKB48,2qyl2y,BurntJoint,2,Thu Jan 1 08:05:18 2015 UTC,"Oh sweet as, thanks man.  I knew that there were shows before AKBingo but i just didn't know what they were called."
AKB48,2qyl2y,Kyle6Flukey,3,Thu Jan 1 08:13:34 2015 UTC,"No worries mate, i should probably also point you toward the AKBingo master list which has descriprions of every episode, softsubs, streaming and downloads of every episode that has been subbed so far."
AKB48,2qyl2y,BurntJoint,1 point,Thu Jan 1 08:24:48 2015 UTC,Oh man that's insane.  Thanks dude.
AKB48,2qyl2y,Kyle6Flukey,2,Thu Jan 1 08:29:43 2015 UTC,"When you finish with AKB, let me know and ill point you in the right direction for all of the other '48 group variety shows. Lots of good shows out there to watch."
AKB48,2qyl2y,BurntJoint,3,Thu Jan 1 08:57:54 2015 UTC,Anything with Miyazawa Sae in it is top.
AKB48,2qyl2y,Kyle6Flukey,5,Thu Jan 1 09:06:28 2015 UTC,"I originally got into AKB around the time of 9-kisei, and my real entry was listening to Konya ha Kaeranai (Shimada, Miorin, and Paruru). As of today, I still love these members. Even Shimada. It's sort of weird since she's not really a standout member nowadays. I would actually think someone was really weird if they said they liked Shimada, but I myself still do."
AKB48,2qyl2y,effectivecatch,4,Thu Jan 1 09:15:53 2015 UTC,"I really like Shimada, as well as the other 9th generation members. In fact they're probably my favorite ones now."
AKB48,2qyl2y,iLoveThisPS3,2,Thu Jan 1 05:51:27 2015 UTC,I like her too. But she wasn't pushed enough like other 9th members (see paruru). She is smart though I hope she gets her break at some point.
AKB48,2qyl2y,NavARXIDA,5,Thu Jan 1 07:37:06 2015 UTC,"For the longest time I really didn't ""get"" Paruru but that's changed after this year. Now I'll be one of the first people out there to support ""whatever works for you"". If you're a fan, and that member appeals to you, whoever she is or what she does, awesome! I guess my opinion about Paruru and Iriyama Anna was something along the lines of ""incredibly neutral"". Let me explain.  This may seem weird, but when I make my opinion on a member, I mainly focus on whether they look like they're enjoying themselves. Awesome dancing during live performances is a big plus too (Team K & SKE !). Maybe before it was my lack of finding moments where I was convinced that they were genuinely happy. I never questioned their work ethic or emotional attachment to the group, but something about their live performances and some variety appearances (more so for Annin than Paruru) never 100% convinced me they enjoyed what they did. I still can't name the exact moment, but something about Paruru this year (could any Paruru-oshi confirm?) finally made her okay in my book! :D Still incredibly neutral on Iriyama Anna though...  Oh and I'm not sure about anything kamioshi related, but Murayama Yuiri, Tani, and Umemoto Madoka are climbing up my oshi list."
AKB48,2qyl2y,MalusRegis,3,Sat Jan 3 03:38:47 2015 UTC,"I remember appreciating her since the Mechaike special, where the second half is all about Paruru coming out of her shell ;) It wasn't 2014 though.."
AKB48,2qyl2y,xrahmx,2,Thu Jan 1 03:03:37 2015 UTC,"Oh nice! I remember watching this a while ago too, but for some reason I still didn't get Paruru. I guess it'll be cool to rewatch it now with a different perspective, thanks!"
AKB48,2qyl2y,MalusRegis,3,Thu Jan 1 03:23:07 2015 UTC,"My biggest issue with Paruru was how hard she was pushed. I have a problem with pushing in general, but she was really shoved down the fans' throats for seemingly no reason. In actuality, it's possible that's why she was the way she was. I'm sure being pushed into the limelight was rough, and she didn't hide it well.  I think both she and Annin are just more reserved/shy in general, though. I don't know why that type of person would become an idol, but they did."
AKB48,2qyl2y,GentlemanlyOctopus,3,Thu Jan 1 04:06:38 2015 UTC,I think I'm starting to like nogizaka46 more than akb48

AKB48,2qyl2y,NavARXIDA,5,Thu Jan 1 16:41:12 2015 UTC,"Kizaki Yuria, Tomonaga Mio and Miyawaki Sakura all seem hella fake to me. I'm sorry, I just see right through them."
AKB48,2qyl2y,minliu,4,Sat Jan 3 03:40:50 2015 UTC,"I understand that feeling, but I get it more towards Mayuyu instead. She just seems so picture perfect, and it scares me a bit."
AKB48,2qyl2y,BurntJoint,6,Thu Jan 1 03:30:40 2015 UTC,"They dont call her the idol cyborg for nothing... She has always been the perfect idol.   I have no problem with them being ""fake"" as being an idol is nothing more than a job that they have to perform to keep the fans happy. Some people are just better at playing that role and keeping their personal life out of the public eye."
AKB48,2qyl2y,minliu,4,Thu Jan 1 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"I understand what you mean, but I feel like they're the kind of girls that talk shit about other members/their fans and are simply ungrateful. Might seem harsh but.. Yeah."
AKB48,2qyl2y,effectivecatch,5,Thu Jan 1 07:36:27 2015 UTC,"It's funny because I remember seeing on some clip where they ran around the members' hotel rooms super early with a camera waking everyone up, they went into Mayuyu's room and were snooping in her bag before waking her up. They got out her ipod to see what she was listening to. They were like, ""ahh, just like always.. all she listens to is anime music. boring!"" or something like that.  Then a few years later, all of a sudden she's coming out saying that she loves heavy rock music and one of her favorite bands is Maximum the Hormone.  Really? Those two images don't quite match up. A lot of people were saying that it's all fake, and she doesn't listen to any of that music, and her saying that is just an attempt to give her a bit of an edge, because of like what you were saying, how she's the picture perfect idol, a shiny piece of plastic with no rough spots."
AKB48,2qyl2y,Lamiington,6,Thu Jan 1 21:47:45 2015 UTC,I dunno... I went from liking anime music to heavy metal as well. And now years later im listening to jpop.
AKB48,2qyl2y,macrocosm93,1 point,Thu Jan 1 07:44:20 2015 UTC,I don't think its unusual for someone's musical tastes to evolve as they get older. When I was in high school my musical tastes changed practically every semester.  I don't think its reasonable to assume that someone would listen exclusively to anime music for their entire life.
AKB48,2qyl2y,effectivecatch,6,Thu Jan 1 23:26:54 2015 UTC,"Miyawaki looked like a complete little bitch on the Takamina Dokkiri special. She made these very concerned faces and seemed to be really worried.. but then she let slip out of her mouth that the only reason she was really worried was because of the timing - her (shared with Mayuyu) center debut single was just about to come out. All she cared about was what would happen to her precious single. The whole time, she kept making shocked and worried faces, but it was all only for herself. Terrible"
AKB48,2qyl2y,throw_city,4,Sat Jan 10 17:12:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not crazy on Miyawaki either, but just feel like I have to make some counterpoints here if you'll allow it. The mechaike show used an entire week before they revealed that it was a dokkiri. It'd be pretty easy to get a comment like that and use it for comedy relief on the show with a full week of gossiping between the girls. Secondly I find it understandable for a girl who has the pressure of becoming center with the #1 senbatsu girl to be worried about sales. It's a responsibility put on her from the management and a big part of the pressure as center.  Again I don't particularly like her either but didn't have much issue with that show specifically."
AKB48,2qyl2y,fluubar,3,Thu Jan 1 05:45:44 2015 UTC,"I really think I'm too old to be into AKB, and I'm worried I'm going to turn into a pervy old man.  But their spirit just makes me so happy!"
AKB48,2qyl2y,fluubar,3,Fri Jan 2 04:36:02 2015 UTC,AKB is for everyone so never be ashamed for liking something including if it makes you happy! Unless its really really really wrong. Like illegal wrong...
AKB48,2qyl2y,Jakiepoo110,3,Thu Jan 1 12:05:04 2015 UTC,"Haha, nooo, nothing like that! I think the recent focus of the media here has just made me worried about things."

AKB48,2qyl2y,fierce_glare,2,Thu Jan 1 12:29:42 2015 UTC,"That is kinda harsh... although I would agree that she is not Idol material... If lets say she is middle level, and you put her in a SO HIGH level of beautifull girls, then yea ... kinda sucks to be her."

Still, there's a whole ton of experience and leadership between them that will definitely be missed. Hopefully some other members are ready to step up and lead as best as they can !"

AKB48,2p5on2,eehreum,2,Mon Dec 15 01:50:07 2014 UTC,"None of those countries deny nor play down those events, I believe?   Neither does Japan with regards to its WW2 atrocities. Quite the opposite in fact. Japan has made so many apologies for its crimes, their apologies have their own wikipedia page.  Japan doesn't downplay those events, it's that China and Korea (their politicians) keep bringing it up every month for their own political gain.  In fact, in a Stanford University study of Asian history text books, they found that out of American, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean books, Japanese were the least nationalistic and ""stuck straight to the facts"" about what happened. They didn't ignore, hide or try to gloss over their war crimes.   Japan (as a country) doesn't deny what's happened, China and Korea's pushing of that narrative is straight up propaganda."

I'm definitely feeling the holiday spirit after that MV, the perfect break from studying for finals :D   What was the BEST & WORST 48 moment for you this year?   Best moment for me was SKE's concerts at the Nagoya Dome on their National Tour. The crazy sea of orange and unexpected performances were amazing. I know that the Daisokaku Matsuri earlier this year gave me a whole bunch of mixed emotions. Overall though, I'm really happy for Yui, who managed to keep her rank in this year's crazy sousenkyo and get chosen by Takamina to be the next Soukantoku, and wmatsui for entering the Top 5.   What single/album was your favorite released this year?   I have to leave it as a three way tie between Labrador Retriever, Kokoro no Placard, and SKE's Mirai to Wa?. AKB's singles sounded a bit off to me at first, but they grew on me after a few days.   Has anyone new caught your eye in terms of members? Who?   I've wanted to ask everyone something related to this now that it's been a while since the Daisokaku Matsuri. How do you like the changes that happened with the respective group/team you follow? After everything settled down a bit, I found myself supporting Team E :)  A whole bunch of members caught my attention this year too: Kawamoto Saya, Omori Miyu, Murayama Yuiri, Umemoto Madoka, Miyamae Ami, Tani Marika, Azuma Rion, Takatera Sana, Koishi Kumiko, Kotani Riho, Shibuya Nagisa, Sakaguchi Riko, and Tanaka Natsumi.   My holiday plans usually involve me staying at home on my computer or playing video games with some Premier League soccer games on and sleeping in the same room as the Christmas tree. I'll definitely watch some 48G stuff over break too.  Anyways, sorry for another long post and hopefully you guys have a more eventful holiday season than I do !"

It's been a rollercoaster year for me, moving to Jakarta for university, watching JKT48 theater performances so much, living alone, etc.  Anyway, here are my answers. (NOTE: Very JKT48-centric)   What was the BEST & WORST 48 moment for you this year?   Best moment: Definitely JKT48's Kokoro no Placard Handshake Event. Seeing your oshimen's line getting more crowded than before makes you happy for some reason. Also got my time to just say whatever I want to her.  Worst moment: I mistook my oshimen with some other member due to extremely similar hair, similar height, and me not wearing my glasses.   What news shocked you the most?   That Takamina is going to graduate.   What single/album was your favorite released this year?   Definitely Kokoro no Placard, it's catchy, and also its JKT48 version was translated well.   Has anyone new caught your eye in terms of members? Who?   Frieska (Melody's sister) is actually quite interesting. Also Team J's capt. Kinal is very kind and charming.   Where will you be this holiday season? Going anywhere nice?   Going back to my hometown of course.   Looking back, what change are you wanting in the 2015 year?   Better grades! Moer attention to univ assignments!  Once again, happy holidays!"

AKB48,2on1qw,OdaijiNi,3,Mon Dec 8 12:38:10 2014 UTC,"I was hoping this was another joke.   A site called ""fake49"" didn't help with that. It took me a second look to realize it wasn't fake.  As for my feelings on the matter, they're mixed. She's great as Soukantoku, and she brings a lot to the group, a lot more than you would expect one person could. At the same time, it would be impossible for her to stay in the group and reach her goal to be a successful solo artist. And it will be difficult for AKB to move forward as a group if she stays."
AKB48,2on1qw,GentlemanlyOctopus,6,Wed Dec 10 04:21:06 2014 UTC,"Oh wow. I know graduation is inevitable but I always had this idea that Takamina would be the last 1st generation member to graduate. It's just sad to see another person graduate, especially one who's been there from the very beginning. I can only imagine how emotional her graduation will be.  In a small positive note, I'm glad she chose Yui to be her successor as Soukantoku :)"
AKB48,2on1qw,MalusRegis,4,Mon Dec 8 13:34:26 2014 UTC,"I hoped she would be the last one to graduate, too. Mostly because it would have been such a Takamina thing to do since I don't see her wanting to wish that loneliness on the other two. The tenth anniversary for her makes sense, too, but I don't have to like it."
AKB48,2on1qw,lovewingbell,6,Mon Dec 8 13:42:37 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the last will be Miichan, since both Kojiharu and Takamina have work lined up outside the 48G, and Team 4 still needs guidance.   Takamina has stated that she's only graduating if all original Team A (including Miichan) has graduated.   So yeah, next year all 3 will leave. Today's theater performance was super good too... The feels..."
AKB48,2on1qw,piyochama,5,Mon Dec 8 16:49:23 2014 UTC,"I always thought that maybe, Takamina won't graduate from 48 at all. Like, she might stop becoming a performing member, but become some sort of a manager or other leader/managerial position. I'm certain she's more than capable of doing so. But then again, she has her dreams and aspirations beyond 48G, and as a fan I would like her to try her best at achieving those dreams.  Thanks for the many years of great works, Takamina! Otsukare!"
AKB48,2on1qw,namba48,3,Tue Dec 9 04:00:03 2014 UTC,"This is not okay. :( Takamina is the whole reason I'm with AKB and the reason I got into idols. I knew this day was coming. Even the dokkiri recently was too heartfelt and real to not be her true emotions. She's mentioned it a lot recently and she's done so much... But I really don't want to see her go. It will be a sad day in AKB when she officially leaves next year. I really hoped she'd make Kami 7 one last time though, since that's what she wanted.  I'll keep supporting her until the end--longer even!"

AKB48,2on1qw,turtles_and_frogs,2,Mon Dec 8 13:35:45 2014 UTC,"That's my issue. I don't really have a reason beyond Takamina so it feels like any continuing would be half-hearted. At the same time it also feels like if I stopped supporting them now it would negate everything Takamina's worked for and all of her hopes. She's leaving now because she believes AKB can stand on its own, so she wants us to keep supporting it! But Takamina is AKB for me."
AKB48,2on1qw,lovewingbell,2,Tue Dec 23 20:05:22 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I can see your point.  I'm sure akb48 will live on.  They will always have an audience.  They're all very talented.  I just don't know yet, if that audience will be me. :)  I heard Takamina was thinking about even going into politics.  I think she should do it!"
AKB48,2on1qw,turtles_and_frogs,3,Wed Dec 24 16:55:56 2014 UTC,"When I heard the news this morning, my heart began to hurt. :c  Takamina became one of my favorites when I first began liking AKB. From what I read, she's not graduating until next December, so there's still time for everything, and I'm going to support her as much as possible! D: even if i'm a struggling broke college student. ; A ;   I'm pretty happy that Yuihan's the next Soukantoku. I was thinking Takamina was going to either choose her or Sayanee. >_>"
AKB48,2on1qw,hachiagejo,3,Thu Dec 25 02:35:59 2014 UTC,"I now have mixed feelings with the countdown. But wow, of all the graduation announcements after Acchan (Oshimen). This felt like really flat to me, it is like one of the big foundation of AKB48 will be gone.    A big cheers still to Takamina and also the soon-to-be Soukantoku, Yui. :)"

AKB48,2ohy10,Lamiington,1 point,Sun Dec 7 01:23:10 2014 UTC,"My thoughts after watching the whole thing on TV:  A lot of the girls said things like ""So what?"" or ""That's great"" or ""I want her to be happy"" when they were taken into the room and shown the picture of takamina with the guy. I thought that was awesome. Obviously these girls realize that being an idol is a temporary job, and finding love/happiness/a partner is something pretty much everyone searches for in life. It was nice to see the girls speak like that.  Mayuyu is weird. I like her, more than I used to, and I know she has a more complex personality than what we see on TV (I read her essays in that AKB collection book thing) But she was just... a blank slate the entire episode... no smiles or shock or confusion, her face just stayed the same throughout everything. I'm wondering if she's incredibly aware of herself when being filmed, due to being number 1 or being in AKB for so long.  Sasshi, Kojiharu, Miichan: Awesome. They've been around long enough that nothing fazes them anymore, lol.  The HKT girls (Sakuratan? I don't know the other one's name) reactions were really great. I can see why HKT is the ""fresh"" group, or the group with the young ""pure"" members? You just feel like their reactions are pretty honest and not staged. It was hilarious when Sakuratan was like ""Is my single going to be okay in spite of this scandal?"" LOL  Takamina and those tears. I bet she could cry within seconds if someone told her too. I would love to see her do more acting, maybe she should graduate... haha.  Miyazawa Sae, they poked fun at her calling her gossip girl but I thought her reactions were more about her being such a veteran in AKB. She's probably seen/experienced so much since joining the group that when she saw Takamina's scandal picture her mind started racing to all possible outcomes.   That SKE girl. I don't know her name. Did anyone else feel like she had a really bad attitude? She seemed stand offish the entire episode... I don't know anything about her so it was my first impression of her."

AKB48,2knz4a,piyochama,4,Wed Oct 29 15:21:17 2014 UTC,"point of throwing bags just to pick them up again.   It's meant to show the transition from older gen centers to new gens. Basically, the bags are the ""center"" positions and they toss it to the incoming generations, hence why only graduated members who actually centered a single are in the MV."

AKB48,2knz4a,LtYellowFace,8,Wed Oct 29 16:30:22 2014 UTC,I might be wrong on this but i think Yuko and Itano threw fake bags in the pile and switched around the real bags with the fake ones to deceive to chasers and they did seem to be looking confused in the scene where they were all surrounding Mariko
AKB48,2knz4a,hachiagejo,2,Wed Oct 29 18:39:23 2014 UTC,"You're right on that, actually. On the ZIP coverage, the scene switches to them mainly chasing Yuko and Tomochin after they threw the bags, so they probably did that to be the 'decoys', perhaps?"

(Solo stuff aside, of course) However Itano was very much in the ""focus"" of many videos, like 10nenzakura.

AKB48,2jozd8,cultofz,5,Sun Oct 19 14:42:24 2014 UTC,"That's quite a nice start to your merchandise collection!  I mainly buy 48Gs albums, singles, concert releases and photobooks, so I have more experience buying those sorts of things.  For buying more conventionally available stuff like CDs, Blu-ray/DVD, and photobooks, I've used two sites which have served me well:  CDJapan: This site is all in English and is easy to navigate as a result.  Pros of this site are:   Entire site is in English, even the search Can choose the level of shipping desired ranging from cheaper but much slower shipping to the fastest but most expensive level Pretty good customer support in my experience, with good English support. Can help you order stuff which does not ship outside Japan and will act as a forwarding service for you (for a fee of course and requires EMS)   Downsides are:   A bit of a markup (~10-15% in my experience).  Take for example, HKT48's upcoming concert release.  CDjapan has this available for ￥11,000.  Amazon Japan has this for ￥8791.  For high price items, the markup can make going through Amazon Japan cheaper (not to mention faster shipping to boot).   Amazon Japan is a very good source as well. They do have the site partially translated into English meaning that the major things are translated into English like navigating menus, and the screens you'd come accross when placing an order.  Everything else is of course in Japanese but it's not hard to understand.  Pros of this  site:   As I already gave an example when discussing CDJapan, lower prices on their items. Their shipping is very fast and shipping can take as short as 3 days (when I lived in areas that DHL had offices directly in) and as long as 6 days (this applies to where I'm living now, since there is no DHL branch in my city).   Downsides:   Only one level of shipping available.  This means that ordering one or two things can be prohibitively expensive thanks to shipping.  Once you make it a large order then it becomes better value.  For example, here is an example order of mine with personal details crossed out."

Is it set in Japan or is it a Fantasy game?  More details will definitely help narrow it down, the only game that even comes to mind when you say red uniforms is Final Fantasy Type-0 but that definitely doesn't sound like AKB."

The article says that it's been confirmed that the two people in this picture have gone on at least 3 dates within the span of 3 weeks. If you know that much, you'd probably have some more photographic ""evidence"". Yet they chose to publish such blurry photos that you can't even tell if it's really her?

AKB48,2il6fj,LunacyBoy,4,Wed Oct 8 12:36:10 2014 UTC,Sayuri and Ikoma Rina are hosting a radio show right now. Sayuri apologized and said that she'd been on karaoke dates with the guy a couple of times and  that she was drunk when she kissed him.   Generally people aren't taking it so well with it being both a married man and one of the editors of Young Jump gravure magazine. She said shes staying with the group though.

If it was some random single dude that's her age, they can kind of pass it off as an ""innocent mistake"" (though I honestly think they should be able to date if they want to). But dating a married man? There's a lot of potential for a forced graduation."

AKB48,2hx1ta,CueBreaker,2,Wed Oct 1 01:55:27 2014 UTC,I'd say it's one of the worse scandals actually. There are often photos and speculation but very rarely do you see two-shots like this. It's just not big because she's not as popular.

AKB48,2gpwkr,fierce_glare,7,Thu Sep 18 01:31:52 2014 UTC,"The problem for this, and all of the past Janken tournaments for me is, I just don't understand how the one who wins is always one of the bigger members. Sure, everyone has a possibility, but 4 of the 5 tournaments(not including the first one) and not one with a somewhat lesser known member winning the entire thing? I don't buy it. The management tries to back up their story and make it seem like it is okay by saying ""Oh hey! What about all the lesser known under girls that made it into the 16?!"" I'm not trying to bash the group I love, but it's just so hard not seeing those lesser known girls ever get a chance. Especially in the ONE event that can really help them"
AKB48,2gpwkr,OdaijiNi,6,Thu Sep 18 02:10:09 2014 UTC,"I agree. This just seems too perfect. Last year Jurina won by doing nothing but paper. Now that its being mentioned I've only seen 1 tournament where the #1 spot was from someone who wasn't being pushed by management, and that was the first one. I really wish this tournament was used to help some of under girls and not keep pushing the higher ups."
AKB48,2gpwkr,RinaLuvsPandas,3,Thu Sep 18 01:54:01 2014 UTC,I have never had very strong feelings about the janken taikai but I have to agree that this is pretty suspicious.

AKB48,2gpwkr,CueBreaker,1 point,Thu Sep 18 18:03:08 2014 UTC,MTE. Of course a group with a million+ sales on any single is going to rig a tournament determining how the next single (even if it doesn't count as AKB) is going to sell.
AKB48,2gpwkr,piyochama,1 point,Fri Sep 19 17:19:19 2014 UTC,"There are 300 girls in all the groups, some of them are stupid enough to talk/write about it. If it is rigged it will eventually leak. Wait for it.  PS: I know most of you know/think that Japanese TV Shows are rigged and I could see that for many shows, but this Janken Taikai thing I think is real. My opinion though."
AKB48,2gpwkr,NavARXIDA,4,Thu Sep 18 05:46:40 2014 UTC,"I was actually one of the stronger voices AGAINST there being ""rigged"" things in the AKB family. For example, a lot of people thought that Sasshi becoming number 1, or Jurina winning with ""all paper"" was faked, but I genuinely thought those were legit happenings. (Jurina's win was suspicious, but there were many other candidates to give the win to even if Aki-P wanted to)  I just read a lot of forum stuff before the Janken event happened, and so many people were talking about how the winner would most likely be a girl from NMB because they were doing so poorly this year. Also, some fans were fed up with Miyuki's scandal (I dont think she did it but her character is annoying and people probably chose to believe it because of that).   A win with an NMB member would boost fan moral, causing more sales in both AKB single and the next NMB single.  As you said, there are 300 girls. If the event was truely random, TRUELY random, there would be a really high chance the senbatsu would include members that no one has even heard of, and have never gotten any camera/TV time ever. Maybe some of the Janken tourney is faked and some of it isn't. Maybe some girls are told what to throw for just one match, and then the rest is up to them. Maybe the girls THEMSELVES talk prior to the event and decide who should win from their pair. Who knows. It just seems fishy this time around."
AKB48,2gpwkr,GentlemanlyOctopus,1 point,Thu Sep 18 06:06:46 2014 UTC,"Any time there is a pattern that emerges from an event that should be random, people start causing a ruckus. Said ruckus is usually louder when people don't like the results.   While all those things you said may be true, it doesn't negate the chance, however small it is, that it WAS truly random."

Basically, my theory as to their rigging is that they wait til the final 16 and start telling people how to play to determine the center. It just makes sense that this is how it's done."

If an American celebrity was in a smash bros commercial I might consider that they have interest in the game.  I really doubt any of those girls will play this game, and there's probably at least half a dozen girls that are super excited for this game and would love to be in the commercial but didn't get the opportunity because they're not the most popular.  The top 10 girls are too busy keeping up appearances and attempting to look like hard workers to be caught with a 3ds in their hands, even outside of work. To me this is both AKB selling out their girl's likenesses and Nintendo selling out to incorporate AKB's popularity and sell a feature in their game."

I've only seen a few of their appearances in Japan and some behind-the-scenes stuff from their MVs. I do like the certain energy they bring to their performances which, I think, can be comparable to Team K or SKE.   In terms of the future, I just hope that they do well. I really don't like seeing people/groups fail or struggle in general, so just as people I hope they accomplish the goals they have for themselves, whether it includes just increasing their presence, getting their own singles, or whatever else they may be.   Given where I am, it would be hard (but not impossible) to watch the stream when it happens, so if I happen to get one and there is someone out there in a more favorable timezone, I wouldn't mind you giving it to them (I just wanted to contribute to the discussion).

AKB48,2f8wh9,gerrykomalaysia,3,Tue Sep 2 10:10:51 2014 UTC,That's pretty cool if only she was taller but yeah she's more cute this way I guess...
AKB48,2f6anq,saiardvark,13,Mon Sep 1 15:22:00 2014 UTC,"One thing you should probably note is that scandals don't automatically make someone less famous by default. The Japanese have a clear distinction between 知名度 (the amount of people that 'know' your name) and 人気 (popularity based on likeability), and the scandal had an impact on her popularity (amongst some akbg fans), but the people that knew her name grew, by a lot.  It's quite easy to see that she would definitely have come to where she is without the aid of the scandal, especially since she was a rising star from before the scandal. She had gotten all her gigs from her winning #4, and if anything the scandal simply accelerated where she was going.  From one point of view the scandal did have a negative impact of her career. She was basically forced to move to Fukuoka (far enough that generally they take a plane there, from Tokyo), and be the most senior in a group filled with kids. This might not seem like a 'punishment' in retrospect, but you can think up a similar situation in a normal Western setting and see how bad it really is. I'm reading Sasshi's book at the moment, and she basically talks about how she felt like her career was done the moment she found out about the article. It was this feeling that probably drove her more than anything to a great recovery.  Pragmatically however, Sashihara has demonstrated a good grasp of TV and how fans tick. She credits it mostly to her own experiences as a hardcore Morning Musume fan (she reads 2ch regularly, for example), but she also has some underrated skill in being an MC and generally a pleasant character.  For example, she's long since turned the scandal into a gag for her own use. Whenever someone asks ""What kind of man do you like?"", her answer is ""Someone who can keep a secret."" It gets laughs every single time (although funnily, sometimes from people who have heard it more than once), and she gains a lot of casual fans in exchange for some hardcore fans (some believe that it's not right to turn her breaking the rules into a joke; I agree with this, to a certain extent).   She's also shown herself to be a great leader of HKT48. To be perfectly honest HKT48 wasn't exactly a great sister group at the start. Some might remember that 5 girls basically quit HKT48 after a scandal, around the time when Sashihara came in. They were basically kids, physically detached from the AKB48 stronghold in Tokyo and managed by a group that had no experience with entertainment. Sasshi basically came in, steered HKT on the right path and has been keeping at it since. Almost every time she gets on a TV show where she has some influence (think Sashihara no Ran), some girls are going to appear along with her. While this may not really be due to Sasshi's insistence, it's clear that Sasshi's presence has caused HKT48 to come into the forefront as a result of it. It's also this reason that caused so many people to vote for Sasshi, because she ""has worked so hard in HKT48"".   tl;dr Sasshi's popularity is a mix of wit, brains, luck and a lot of Japanese sentiment for the underdog."
AKB48,2f6anq,maliciel,2,Tue Sep 2 05:09:20 2014 UTC,Which led to my next question. why hasn't she centered an HKT48 single yet? I mean she's obviously the most popular member in HKT48 and yet they keep giving the center position to some girls that are ranked waaay lower in senbatsu.   I was expecting her to center every single HKT48 song... just like how Jurina and Rena Matsui are with SKE48
AKB48,2f6anq,doraemon86,4,Tue Sep 2 21:49:23 2014 UTC,"I'm probably less informed than maliciel, but my opinion is that Sasshi works best as ""next-to-center"" or 2nd or 3rd place. Yes, Koisuru Fortune Cookie was huge, and I do believe Sasshi plays a part in that, but in HKT48 the emphasis is on the new, fresh, ""genki"" members that make up of the group.   Sasshi is an amazing support role. On television shows, especially interviews with various members of AKB48 all at the same time (for example, having all 16 members of the senbatsu on for questions) Sasshi knows how to read the atmosphere and say something interesting or funny or relevant at the PERFECT time. She's saved members before who have given bland responses which would generate an ""Oh, ok..."" from the tv show's host, and you can tell she works hard to keep things fun and interesting for viewers.   I'm a huge Sasshi fan. I don't think she's the center that AKB can make best use of, but I can't imagine AKB without her. Her graduation would sadden me much more than any previous one (even though I'm a die hard tomochin fan)"
AKB48,2f6anq,fierce_glare,2,Wed Sep 3 02:16:10 2014 UTC,"This is exactly the case. Coincidentally, I'm actually reading Sasshi's book, and she says pretty much the same thing regarding what she brings to the table. Her skill in MC comes from directing attention, and directing the girls to do the 'interesting' things."
AKB48,2f6anq,maliciel,1 point,Wed Sep 3 08:58:37 2014 UTC,"I was going to ask previously, but I figured its something I can just google (and then didn't...) Sasshi has a book? I've been living in Japan for a year now and I can read Japanese novels; I would absolutely LOVE to read something written by Sasshi.  I have the AKB book that came out a couple years ago where each girl gets a ""chapter"" and explains something about their life and being a member in AKB. Is this a different book than the one you're referring to? Thank you in advance by the way :)"
AKB48,2f6anq,fierce_glare,3,Wed Sep 3 10:28:43 2014 UTC,"Yep!  It was released quite recently: 逆転力 ~ピンチを待て~  I'm about halfway through and it's an interesting read. She didn't write any of it (admits as much in the interview at the launch event), but it was done through interview format. As the title suggests she talks about how she has a knack for reversing situations to her advantage. And of course, it's evident that she's had quite a few of those."
AKB48,2f6anq,maliciel,1 point,Wed Sep 3 12:04:41 2014 UTC,So basically the idol version of Kuroko no Basket.
AKB48,2f6anq,SuperstarTinsanity,3,Wed Sep 3 20:36:27 2014 UTC,"I feel that there is no real benefit to making Sashihara centre. Sasshi is the oldest girl in HKT48, and for her to get centre position would give rise to a lot of 'problems', I think!   Sasshi loses the gag where she says ""I was #4 when I came in but I've never been centre"" HKT48 is still new, but some members are already disgruntled. This will only make it worse It will seem like Sashihara used her own power as manager to get centre position Mgmt loses out on an opportunity to grow another talent by using the news flood from a new HKT single Fans will feel that Sasshi betrayed the group she was brought in to raise by taking the most desirable position Mgmt cannot cash in on the ongoing stories in HKT48, because these generally do not involve Sasshi   If you're wondering about that last one, check out the announcement for HKT48's 4th single, where they talked about Haruppi's own struggle to be centre. It is these stories that make it interesting to follow idol groups. For them to just hand it to Sasshi would be simply erasing the canon (think Lucas!). I think it will introduce un-needed conflict amongst fans if it ever came to 'permanent Sasshi centre' in HKT48, too.  Looking at it pragmatically, being a centre is about the media exposure. And certainly, that's not something that Sasshi needs more of. It will go to waste, when she could be at the side with the centre and playing off her instead.   As /u/fierce_glare mentioned, it certainly keeps the freshness of HKT48. Sashihara gives very few benefits by being centre, but due to the fact that she can generate waves on her own, just having her appear as a member is okay, she doesn't need to be centre."
AKB48,2f6anq,maliciel,2,Wed Sep 3 09:21:17 2014 UTC,"I appreciate your take on this   I feel that there is no real benefit to making Sashihara centre.   the only reason I brought this up is because 48 groups are known to put their most popular members in public for as long as they can. as many times as they can.   Like I said, Jurina and Rena Matsui are the centers in every single SKE48 singles.. because they're the most popular members in SKE48.  I understand your point about letting the other members shine. but that's not the case with the other 48 groups is it? esp AKB48. there are many girls in AKB48 that deserve a spot in senbatsu (in ANY single) yet they keep getting shafted for the management to make room for the more popular members from their own group and WORSE from their sister groups. (Sashi (hkt48)/ Rena (SKE48/Nogizaka, etc)..  so i guess my confusion lies more in why HKT is getting a different treatment as a group than the other 48 groups"
AKB48,2f6anq,doraemon86,1 point,Thu Sep 4 02:59:01 2014 UTC,"It's probably because they are slowly realizing that some policies need to be changed. For example, SKE48 took the same approach as AKB did. Even though they're only 1 year younger than the head group, they are in a rut because now SKE48 is conflated with JR.   NMB48 is again a little different, because while they always have the same few in senbatsu, they are also grounded in the comedy capital of Japan, and that is a route which many of the girls are happy to be involved in, despite never making it into senbatsu. So while the static centres are still kind of a concern, it's not as much.   The approach they're taking with HKT48 is solely to ensure long-term longevity with driving the group into a rut they've stuck the other two into before. Not learning from their mistakes would simply doom HKT48 to the same fate."
AKB48,2f6anq,maliciel,-1,Thu Sep 4 03:57:59 2014 UTC,A little over done for my tastes but I appreciate the effort you put in for the explanation :)
AKB48,2f6anq,GentlemanlyOctopus,4,Tue Sep 2 05:33:07 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the explanation! I can agree on her comedic talents (never fails to bring a smile on my face)!   Just as a follow up,  would you say that the media exposure she got during her scandal (whether good or bad) helped her get to where she is now or would she be where she is now even without that media exposure (due to her popularity before the scandal) ?

Ganbare/Ganbate is a word you hear WAY TO MANY TIMES for a reason.

I'm legit confused by this. SHE RANKED, AND SHE GETS KICKED OUT OF SENBATSU. I'm so confused... Someone explain this to me. (I love Nako btw don't get me wrong, but I mean... Russia..... Shes adorable.)"
AKB48,2f2vf7,RinaLuvsPandas,3,Sun Aug 31 13:27:24 2014 UTC,"Given her recent ""scandal"" it was to be expected that she will be dropped for at least one single. If you have noticed she also hasn't appeared in any variety show ever since then.  It feels like some sort of silent punishment but on the plus side no actions were taken and she's still an active member. Management could also forced her grad so just one senbatsu w/o her isn't bad.  NakoMiku are the 3rd gen aces, HKT's 'future' they're popular and you can expect them to be fixed senabtsu members."
AKB48,2f2vf7,OdaijiNi,1 point,Sun Aug 31 19:04:40 2014 UTC,Her popularity is still pretty high though... Oh well... No Anya for one single is okay.. I guess... I want a Sakura center next time though!

I'm not saying this is a bad thing though.  Unless foreign fans also got easier, more consistent access to 48G content available in Japan like variety shows, specials, or even theater streams (hopefully JKT's stream works out well!) that feature other members, I think it would be understandably more difficult for foreign fans as a whole to discover members that don't have the opportunities that members like Mayu, Sasshi, Yukirin, Paruru, Kojimako, etc. have."

AKB48,2ewg0g,oSwooD,1 point,Fri Aug 29 17:19:59 2014 UTC,"Foreigners can buy tickets just as easy as Japanese fans. They're just too lazy to look for sources. There are always plenty Tumblrs or users on Stage48 who sell them for rly fair prices.  As for the actual question, Mayu will always win over Sasshi no matter what. 2nd to 5th ranks would be Takamina, Paruru, Sayanee, Jurina (in no particular order).  Sakura, Haruppi, Rena, Yukirin, Kojiharu would round it up for Top10.  Not really sure who'd be 11th to 16th"
AKB48,2ewg0g,kagayaki,1 point,Sat Aug 30 03:28:26 2014 UTC,"Are foreign fans unable to get tickets for some reason? I put in 5 votes for Kizaki Yuria this year at $10 a pop, which, unless I'm mistaken, isn't that far off of what the theater version would cost for a Japanese person. $50 bucks for 5 votes is still pretty expensive, but a lot better than the $70-100 I probably would have spent for the CDs + shipping.  Of course, I wasn't purchasing the whole CD; I found someone on tumblr I trusted who was trying to get more votes for Yuria so I went in with that. I think what she was doing was gathering money and then hooking up with someone else, who was hooking up with someone in Japan to actually buy them locally. Heh, it sounds like a lot of work when I put it like that, but it was mostly just a happy coincidence and perhaps some misplaced trust.  That being said, I don't believe it would noticeably change the outcome. For one, I imagine even if there was more general knowledge about the existence of AKB48  in the West the group would not be that well received. All you have to is go to /r/jpop  is to see what most western fans think of the group. I've had more than one ""debate"" there about whether or not 48G is the death of jpop. So we're starting off with a VERY niche audience in countries that don't generally enjoy foreign media. The amount of people who would actually put money toward a senbatsu ticket are even fewer. I wonder if there are any real statistics on the how much of the Japanese fanbase actually purchase multiple CDs for that reason. Those statistics would probably be skewed for the reasons I described above anyway.  Perhaps this is not the answer you were looking for, but I think it's the most realistic one. ;) If you immerse yourself in either stage48 or the 48G tumblrverse, there's plenty of opportunities to get sousenkyo tickets on the (relative) cheap."

AKB48,2c4dr1,ryuu_kujirai,2,Thu Jul 31 03:15:51 2014 UTC,I would have loved to see that as well.
AKB48,2c4dr1,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Thu Jul 31 05:48:16 2014 UTC,It is the outfits.ಠ_ಠ
AKB48,2bzaao,oSwooD,6,Mon Jul 28 20:51:10 2014 UTC,"Second English article Interview   Her book even hit no.1 in amazon's selling charts (which is impressive) _  FYI This year she ranked 63th in the Sousenkyo.  and here's just a random unit with her since I'm sure not that many people actually know her.   Tenshi no Shippo (Sayaya, Naanya, Nakkii)"
AKB48,2bzaao,OdaijiNi,2,Mon Jul 28 20:55:47 2014 UTC,That is really really impressive. This goes to show how the personalities and interests of the girls in the group are so diverse. It makes me wonder what other kind of cool things some of the other not so well known girls do!
AKB48,2bzaao,Glacia,5,Tue Jul 29 00:50:23 2014 UTC,Matsui Rena used to say that her special skill was programming in COBOL.
AKB48,2bzvww,RinaLuvsPandas,1 point,Tue Jul 29 00:13:36 2014 UTC,What does 'gui gui' even mean? She looks older now O_o.
AKB48,2bzvww,MalusRegis,3,Tue Jul 29 00:47:18 2014 UTC,"From what I know, ""gui gui"" is basically used to describe members who will make random comments or perform gags during a any sort of media coverage (variety or otherwise) in order to more actively present themselves to get more screen time. Members labeled as ""gui gui"" can be seen almost always trying to do something interesting if they are placed in the back of the main crowd for the filming, or they will not hesitate to move themselves to the center of the group for some attention. Again, this is just what I think it means after watching a good amount of variety, but if anyone else feels my description isn't accurate, please correct me by all means :D  I'm not saying I hate this type of character though. Murashige's character seemed perfectly fine for Odekake, and I really liked Tani Marika's role there too XD"

AKB48,2bx3xn,OdaijiNi,5,Mon Jul 28 05:06:59 2014 UTC,"I've bought the 5 singles albums and 3 video collections. I did a trade to get a Yuko Oshima football shirt. And a Japanese work colleague of my uncle sent me the top 20(?) of the 2013 Best 100 and a manga.  Import costs stop me from going crazy. Well, that and embarrassment."
AKB48,2bx3xn,fluubar,5,Mon Jul 28 09:50:07 2014 UTC,"I know what you mean, but in my case, the shipping costs! I usually just buy when I know I have a good bit of extra cash to spend, because the shipping cost ends up being as much as the items I'm buying! And nice on getting the Yuko football shirt. I always loved those!"
AKB48,2bx3xn,akbzine,2,Mon Jul 28 14:19:47 2014 UTC,"Nothing to be embarrassed about :D  As long as you like something and it doesn't bug anyone, it's all good."
AKB48,2bx3xn,fluubar,1 point,Tue Jul 29 04:07:23 2014 UTC,"That's the thing, I have very little privacy. I couldn't look through a photobook on my own, for example."
AKB48,2bx3xn,pepperoni_slice,5,Tue Jul 29 09:49:47 2014 UTC,"This is my collection so far, its not much but its getting there! I would love to get more of their singles but the shipping costs are hard to justify xD"
AKB48,2bx3xn,pepperoni_slice,2,Mon Jul 28 14:03:35 2014 UTC,"No matter the size, it's still great! I love the shirt and the photobooks you have. I need to finally get around to buying one! Haha! The shipping costs are definitely the toughest part. Those prices can get outrageous :/ Edit: Don't know how I overlooked the arcade stick. So awesome! What fighting games do you play?!"
AKB48,2bx3xn,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Mon Jul 28 14:22:48 2014 UTC,mainly street fighter 4 and persona 4 arena... i play guilty gear and blazblue too but im terrible at those games

AKB48,2bx3xn,darksteel2291,1 point,Mon Jul 28 14:57:54 2014 UTC,"OMG! As an AKB fan and gamer, love that arcade stick :D"
AKB48,2bx3xn,akbzine,7,Mon Jul 28 15:06:14 2014 UTC,"Here's mine.  It's not much of a collection but here ya guys go.  First photo is all the CD's I have, 2nd is photobooks, and 3rd is albums and concert sets.  The fan and ticket in the second photo came from the AKB48 Manatsu no Dome Concert that I went to August 7, 2013 at the Osaka Kyocera Dome."
AKB48,2bx3xn,darksteel2291,2,Mon Jul 28 17:20:14 2014 UTC,"That sounds pretty awesome that you got to see them live in concert (I've yet to go myself).    What is the book on the bottom right in the 2nd photo? I thought I had all the sousenkyo guides, but I don't recognize this one.  PS. another random question: do you shop at Target? I used to have bedsheets that look exactly like yours :D"
AKB48,2bx3xn,akbzine,4,Mon Jul 28 20:33:23 2014 UTC,"That one is AKB48総選挙! 水着サプライズ2013 (AKB48 Sousenkyou! Mizugi Special 2013).  It came out maybe 2 months (do not recall when exactly) after the 2013 sousenkyou.  And yes, those bedsheets are from Target."
AKB48,2bx3xn,darksteel2291,2,Mon Jul 28 20:42:26 2014 UTC,"Cool beans, thanks for the link!"
AKB48,2bx3xn,RinaLuvsPandas,2,Tue Jul 29 04:03:34 2014 UTC,"I think you have a really awesome collection! Even though you have so many great items, that ticket still is the highlight for me. That must have been an amazing experience!"
AKB48,2bx3xn,RinaLuvsPandas,1 point,Mon Jul 28 20:59:21 2014 UTC,"Oh for sure.  The ticket reminds me of the concert experience which was amazing.  Even if I did sit way in the back of the venue which can seat 50k and had to watch a TV screen basically to see the girls relatively closely, the atmosphere of the concert and hearing/seeing it live was simply wonderful."
AKB48,2bx3xn,akbzine,5,Mon Jul 28 22:36:41 2014 UTC,"I have a Tsugi no Ashiato Minegishi Minami card, and its my prize possession. I don't have much money, but when I saw it, I had to buy it xD."
AKB48,2bx3xn,akbzine,3,Mon Jul 28 12:40:44 2014 UTC,"I just looked up the card, and it is really nice! It's worthy of a prize possession, especially because she is your oshi as well! All of the photos for Tsugi no Ashiato were beautiful now that i look at them."
AKB48,2bx3xn,pepperoni_slice,1 point,Mon Jul 28 14:30:06 2014 UTC,":D I was really happy when I got it! It was sorta expensive, but to me it was worth it!"
AKB48,2bx3xn,akbzine,2,Mon Jul 28 14:45:25 2014 UTC,I can imagine it was definitely worth it! :D
AKB48,2bx3xn,ryuu_kujirai,4,Mon Jul 28 16:07:13 2014 UTC,"Ooooh, nice :D  Here's mine: bloop  Ran out of space, but that's most of it. I actually don't buy many CDs -- mostly books, blu-rays, and box-sets."
AKB48,2bx3xn,IndoPr0,2,Mon Jul 28 15:13:00 2014 UTC,"Very nice!! I'm jealous of your blu rays and boxsets! Those are what I really want to get, but they are so pricey. I've been saving up to buy one soon though!"

AKB48,2bsnb0,92abc,7,Sun Jul 27 18:20:16 2014 UTC,A favorite one of mine is when Paruru out shined Mayuyu.
AKB48,2bsnb0,hachiagejo,5,Sat Jul 26 20:30:20 2014 UTC,"Lately Paruru has been on a kick of trying to convince everybody that her character is not the real her. She blames the staff for embellishing her clumsy personality and making her seem more goofy and sort of stupid than she really is. For example, when she got upset that some staff changed her birthday message for someone else (I forgot who it was. maybe Takeuchi Miyu? Or Abe Maria?).  So you'd think she'd be on her best behavior to make everyone see how with-it and clever she actually is. And then she walked away after accepting her ranking in the Sousenkyo, seemingly forgetting or unaware that there was supposed to be an interview. The way she proudly walked off and was totally unaware of everyone staring at her was very ""Paruru"".  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_9RnZt3Ys8"
AKB48,2bsnb0,OdaijiNi,2,Sun Jul 27 12:12:27 2014 UTC,"When I opened her speech and realized that it was not even 2 minutes long, I knew she was going to do something very Paruru-like but the whole speech (not knowing what to say, admitting she's terrible at greeting fans, ending her speech abruptly) then leaving without giving the MC a chance to ask any questions ... well, that's Paruru alright, she's really unique :)"
