TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,anxiouspistachio,22,Mon Jul 20 11:31:41 2015 UTC,There was a newer tech that came from another store that acted like she knew how to do everything already.  She told the RXM she knew how to do deletes and just simply outright deleted the rx instead of storing it back on the profile.  On the 4th of July it was just me and her and I was working on TPRs cause it was slow.  She said she would too.  I'm working away when I notice that my number to review just went from 0 to 20.  Her version of fixing TPRs was taking off all MISC exceptions.  There were at least 2 exceptions she took off that would kill a child (6mL liquid lorazepam for a 7 month kid included).  I was not happy to say the least.
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,thosewholeft,21,Mon Jul 20 14:29:13 2015 UTC,"I recently worked with a Staffing Agency Pharmacist who was the most arrogant, sexist human on the face of the earth. Everything was ""woman's work"" and he refused to do anything but verify and counsel.   At one point, he was holding a stock bottle and trying to decide which put away bin to throw it in. (They are marked alphabetically) He was literally inches away from the place on the shelf where the bottle belonged. I pointed to the shelf and said, ""Or you could just put it there."" He snorted and said, ""Not my job."" Then he tossed the bottle into a bin. (The wrong one, of course)  While the other female Tech and I were running around doing everything, he kept talking about his ""race car"" and how he wanted to rent out a local track, so all his friends could watch him drive.  The kicker was when the Pharmacy Manager (male) showed up and suddenly this guy was all about the job. Customers asking for help with OTC products suddenly had this guy's full attention where before he would blow them off saying, ""I don't work here and don't know where anything is located."" Yep, he was a real prize."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,mskarD2,2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:30 2015 UTC,"I worked with a similar person who floated regularly to my store. He did all the same things, wouldn't help me because it was, ""not his job"" wouldn't help with otc questions or help finding them. That would click instantly over to the exact opposite when another pharmacist walked in.  Couldn't stand the guy. I finally took my pharmacy manager aside and told him what was happening and that he needed to tell the guy he wasn't welcome back and to schedule his shifts elsewhere. Felt really good. Haven't seen him more than a handful of times since."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,Panopticon01,28,Tue Jul 21 04:25:14 2015 UTC,"Worked with a pharmacist who would leave the pharmacy for smoke breaks. Leave us to do the work while he bummed cigarettes. Would close at the end of the night with 30 unchecked orders. Tell people we didn't have stuff when we did because he didn't feel like doing anything over 4 scripts per order. Ended up getting arrested for stealing ambiens and practicing pharmacy under his dad's license, his was suspended a year prior. Ended up killing himself."

TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,Wakka37,13,Mon Jul 20 18:07:44 2015 UTC,"I work in a pharmacy where the prescriptions are printed with the time the customer expects to pick it up (or when the computer expects us to have a new prescription from the md ready... sure we can fill, dispense, and check all 50 prescriptions sent in during the office's lunch break within the hour). I was working with a pharmacist once who would refuse to check any prescription other than those marked as ""waiter"" or with a printed time outside 60 minutes after the current time. No past-dues, nothing for later in the day. They would hand all the past due ones to the secondary checking pharmacist, and if there wasn't anything due in the next hour, would pop a squat on a stool. If anyone came in early, they made us redo the prescription and change the time to a more current one. Meanwhile, we still had about 150 prescriptions in the queues we were furiously working to fill.  They worked an overnight with me one night, and when all of the automatic filling prescriptions dropped, I was working my butt off to print and fill and stack prescriptions to check. The prescriptions print with a due date of midnight the next day, and when I left, they were all still on the counter. I didn't work the next two nights, and when I worked during the day, all of the automatic fills had been left there both nights. All ~200 of them. To fill along with the ~800 we do during the day."

He had been stealing albuterol inhalers for months and selling them uptown on the street. Kind of a stupid move, our store didn't find out until his arrest and he was immediately fired. Our lead tech said it all clicked once we heard; for months we kept having inventory discrepancies.  Other stories, well I worked with a total sociopath of a pharmacist for a whole day, and never went back. He would lie to patients, would call the Quality Assurance hotline (the phone number at the bottom of the receipt to leave comments or complaints) from various phone numbers and pretend to be customers and praise the work he did. A nice old lady dropped off a Z-pack prescription, I filled it in under 2 minutes and handed it to him. ""Make her wait,"" he said, and hid the bag under the computer for 10 minutes. I was schocked and asked him why, and he said he didn't want people to think short wait times were a habit or routine. I still feel bad about not reporting him somehow."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,manipulationcreation,8,Mon Jul 20 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"I worked with this girl who graduated pharmacy school like 4 years before. She's floated at my store a few times, and she calls the doc about EVERYTHING. Rx for losartan says ""1t qd""? She has to call to verify its by mouth. And we all know how often docs don't put route of administration, because we as a pharmacy team KNOW that these certain drugs are always done by mouth or by nose or whatever. She was literally on the phone the whole time, even when all the other techs were telling her she had to verify faster. It's like all the things she learned in pharmacy school were just forgotten and she didn't use any prior knowledge or instincts when working!"
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,sloppy_lobster,10,Mon Jul 20 19:55:57 2015 UTC,"There's a couple I could choose from, but I'll go with the most recent.   I work in an inpatient psychiatric hospital, and up until recently, we had a really terrible pharmacist. She was over 70 and either unwilling or unable to learn the computer system. But what made her terrible was her disdain for actual medicine. She didn't think that our actively psychotic population of patients needed anything other than vitamins and coconut oil. I mean, I get not believing in medicine, but then why become a pharmacist? Why, if you must be a pharmacist, work in a situation where not medicating patients is absolutely not an option? It just blew my mind.   She was actually pretty crazy herself - I've heard stories about how she followed people home from work and threatened to kill herself in the pharmacy, though by the time I met her, she had called down a lot. She was still doing the pretty shit, though. Like, I'd put a medication in my section to use and if she got mad, she'd come and hide it so I'd have to get more and then the rest would show up days later. She used to hide work things life printer ink and personal things like the pictures we have on our desks. And food, she hid food all the time. No one could prove it was her, but everyone knew it was because she made a habit of staying late or sneaking back in when she thought everyone was gone.   She started to decline; forgetting things and messing up so that our boss had to double check everything she did, and was eventually put out on medical leave. She retired, much to the joy of all of us in the pharmacy and the nurses that had to deal with her on a daily basis."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,sloppy_lobster,3,Mon Jul 20 21:51:40 2015 UTC,"That's almost sad. You have to wonder if even early on she was in beginning stages of dementia. Maybe she was legitimately misplacing stuff but couldn't remember where or why she moved it. Lashing out can be very normal reactions to confusion.   If that was the case, it's pretty terrifying that she was a pharmacist."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,meowrawrnda,3,Mon Jul 20 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"She was getting very forgetful so I wouldn't doubt it, but she did all the things before she started forgetting things.

We threw her a retirement party and she seemed happy!"

TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,KixStar,6,Tue Jul 21 13:02:40 2015 UTC,"One of our staff pharmacists, I'll call her RPhNaz, seems to go out of her way to make more work for people.  Two weeks ago on Friday was a perfect example.    She got a call from a patient, talked to them for a few minutes and then asked me, ""Have you ordered any Drysol?""  I said no, because it was backordered.  She talks with the person on the phone some more, puts the line on hold and goes on with her work.  RPhNaz mentions to me that the woman is crazy, telling her that someone named Stephanie said they would order Drysol for her.  There's no one in our store named Stephanie.  I agree that it is odd.  After about ten minutes I ask what's the deal with the line on hold and RPhNaz says it is for me, the lady wants to know why her order for Drysol hasn't been filled.  I tell RPhNaz she never told me the lady was holding to talk to me.  RPhNaz says she did tell me to talk to her.  I ask the patient's info so I can at least look at her profile and try to see what's going on but RPhNaz backed out of the profile to keep verifying and doesn't remember the patient's name.  I brace myself and proceed to spend the next fifteen minuted getting yelled at by this woman who is seriously pissed that she was on hold for ten minutes, insists it was someone in our store who ordered the Drysol her and won't believe me when I tell her that the prescription is at another store entirely where it is very likely that someone named Stephanie ordered it for her.  I finally get off the phone and ask RPhNaz if she told the patient that the prescription is at another store.  She says the patient didn't believe her.  I asked her why she though the patient would believe me, a tech, over her, a pharmacist.  She proceeds to lecture me for five minutes about how I don't know what my job is, all I ever do is stand there and fill.  A tech's job is more than filling, sometimes I will have to order things, type prescriptions and ring.    At this point I make the tactical error of engaging with her.  I make the point that I told her Drysol was backordered, that I knew this because I had tried to order it at numerous points in the last week for several different customers.  Just not this one in particular.  I advised her that I was fully aware that I was required to ring and type, both things that I did when there was an actual line.  I advised her that I did the outside vendor order three nights a week and that I was not the only one who was supposed to order things from that vendor.  We are all supposed to be able to do it.  That it was in fact quite simple, much like ordering products online.  Because that is exactly what it is.  She replied that I was lazy and irresponsible.  I told her she was a gigantic pain in my ass.  Not my best moment.  No one likes working with RPhNaz.  She will only verify and consult.  She will fill if there is a lot of typing.  Her idea of covering drop off is to ask when a patient when they want to pick up a prescription, write that time on it and drop it in a pile for the techs to type.  She spends the better part of her time while she is verifying talking on the phone in Farsi to what I can only assume are her friends because if a new script or consult comes in she will put them on hold, take the call and then go back to talking to them.  She won't refill cells in the ScriptPro but will instead fill it from one of the stock bottles on the shelf.  If there isn't a stock bottle on the shelf she will tell the patient we are out even if the cell has tablets and the cell just needs to be shaken to loosen the pills.  She once told someone we couldn't fill their prescription because the machine was broken.  It was out of labels.  This wouldn't be an issue except that, as a tech, I could get fired for refilling cells in the ScriptPro.  She is blatantly racist towards Asians.  If one of the Asian techs asks her a question RPhNaz will make them repeat it at least once because she ""can't understand what the question is.""  Once she has answered the question she will turn to whichever tech is closest, this is usually me even though we don't like each other, and talk about how stupid the question was and how the Asian tech doesn't know what they are doing.  The pharmacy manager once texted me that she couldn't count on RPhNaz to do anything right."

TalesFromThePharmacy,3dxnk0,mrsculpepper,2,Mon Jul 20 21:18:51 2015 UTC,"At my last store there was a pharmacist who had apparently opened the store once upon a time - she's a bit of a workaholic, but after going on convalescence after a surgery and getting a divorce, she had stepped down. The current pharmacy manager is younger than her, much less of a nazi about the rules, and most importantly, a PharmD, whereas said pharmacist is only an RPH with a bachelors. She was the sweetest person to all of the patients, always smiling and making pleasantries and being ridiculously cheerful. She stuck to the rules religiously, to the point where she had us double counting tramadol before it was controlled because ""it ought to be"" and fioricet because ""it's controlled elsewhere."" When I first met her, I liked her, she was always nice to me and complimented me because I always did things just so and by the book (I'm kind of anal about my job), but one day I overheard another tech saying that that pharmacist made her want to quit.  I didn't get it.   Until one night. I closed with the pharmacist, and when it was late and all the other techs were gone, she proceeded to talk all sorts of shit about our rxm. She talked about how she'd ""make deals"" with longtime patients to keep their c2's in stock, how she hired shitty techs, how in HER day, the pharmacy was always clean and blah blah blah. She insinuated to me that the rxm was somehow in cahoots with the druggies that frequent the town's pill mill, that she was keeping ludicrous amounts of methadone and oxycodone in the store for no good reason,  that she heard her dad used to work for a methadone clinic and that now she was continuing his work in servicing the same clientele. I was trapped with this woman basically trying to tell me my boss was doing things that she could lose her license for, things she should never, ever share with a subordinate.   After that, I noticed more about how she would turn to me and make comments about other techs and how incompetent they were for no good reason.   I ended up telling the rxm about her comments and how uncomfortable she made me. Nothing came of it. The pharmacist is currently working 4 days a week desperately pursuing a master's, because she thinks she's gonna be replaced by a younger PharmD who will work for less. I kinda hope she's right."

TalesFromThePharmacy,3dtfh5,Soezin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:59 2015 UTC,It's so you know which bottle is open.  That way you don't end up with a bunch of open bottles on the shelf that all together probably don't have enough pills in them.
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dtfh5,Megmca,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:04:29 2015 UTC,"ohh, thats cool. the way I figure it out is the new bottles would have those stack of papers and the ones thats opened, people would just throw those papers away"
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dtfh5,Soezin,4,Tue Jul 21 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"Another habit to add that may or may not work for everyone. When I'm at the register and I know the patient will take a long time to sign their name and pay (and there's no other patient to help at the front), I will grabs a few prescriptions that need to put in the will call bins and put them away (except waiters of course). Depending on the pharmacist working that day, I don't do this all the time because one of the pharmacist I work (well use to work with because I just moved) says that doing that makes it seem like I'm not attentive to the patient and may be seen as bad customer service. But as far as I can tell, I haven't had anyone else complain."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dtfh5,redwhite16,3,Mon Jul 20 00:46:34 2015 UTC,"Also to piggyback on this, the pharmacy manager I work with is awesome! At our store we do cycle counts (they may be call something else at the other retail chains) where we need to count inventory for a select number of drugs in the morning (and at least before closing time) as well as log them. My pharmacy manger makes the effort to come in early before the pharmacy opens and does the cycle count for us. He even prints the autos and pulls the stock bottles so everything is set up by the time the first tech gets in. I'm definitely going to do this for my store once I become a pharmacist."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dtfh5,redwhite16,7,Mon Jul 20 00:52:02 2015 UTC,"EDIT: P.S. Any more experienced techs who have ways to improve my advice, let me know and I'll edit, I'm still kinda new :) Also added some tips from the replies below, thanks /u/redwhite16 and /u/shes_a_lurker731!   -I will treat people only with as much respect and politeness as they have chosen to treat me with.   Working retail has made me go about this the other way - no matter how shitty someone is being with me, I'll still maintain niceness as much as possible. I don't let them bring me down. I'm very genuine when I say things like ""Sorry, we can't do that, you'll have to contact your insurance to see what's going on with the price of x,"" thinking how easily that could be me in their shoes. I'm usually more stone-cold with drug seekers though.  Anyway, some tips I've picked up from working at busy pharmacies (mainly a certain three-letter one):  -Learn the brand/generic names and uses of the fast movers especially. (They might be called something else in your store; they're the most common prescriptions). This is especially helpful when entering new prescriptions OR when patients are wanting refills at the drive-thru (""I need my blood pressure ones refilled"") OR when they're picking up their meds (""Yeah, this one's for your blood pressure""). This can save your pharmacist some time.  -ANSWER THE PHONE! ...unless you're working on a waiter who's sitting right there staring at you or you're helping another patient. I hate talking on the phone, but at work, it's a must. The other techs and the pharmacist(s) will appreciate that you don't wait for someone else to get it all the time, too.  -Don't be afraid to ask for help, and make sure to THANK whoever helps you out. I haven't been a tech for too long (couple months), I think I've said ""I have a question..."" and ""thanks for being so patient with me!"" more than anything else at my job. :)  -Know which drugs will be found in the refrigerator. If you're not a pharmacy student or unfamiliar with drugs in general you might not know right away but they'll become more familiar with time.  -When getting a written prescription for a patient (especially controls), make sure the name, DOB, and address are on the script. Ask for a preferred contact number and when they want to pick it up. Write the contact number on the script and when they're picking it up, just in case you get busy with something else and someone else needs to enter it. If the doctor/whoever's signature is ineligible and it's not clear from the paper who may have prescribed it, ask the patient who they saw.  -When entering in a new prescription for a patient who just dropped it off, ask about changes to insurance - saves SO much time and frustration for both you and the patient.  -Current prescription costs more than what they paid in the past? Check their profile, see if they used any discount cards/etc. in the past. Or maybe they didn't meet their deductible yet, especially if it's early in the year (thanks /u/redwhite16). I see it a lot with Vyvanse in particular.  --Also insurance related if you're at a certain three-letter chain: if insurance is expired, try running an eligibility check. It doesn't always work, but when it does it's a lifesaver. (Thanks /u/shes_a_lurker731)!  -Busy store? Still pretty new? Ask if there's anything you can do to help out. You learn more about what to do when you get a free moment, AND get on a good note with the pharmacist(s)/other techs. Though as soon as you say something like that, a waiter dropping off 7 prescriptions instantly appears.  -When marking open bottles with an X, mark the cap too, this is especially helpful when the bottles are on a bottom shelf and saves your knees from some extra work (thanks /u/redwhite16)!   interrupt my work flow to talk about some shit ass drug that treats something we already have solutions for (looking at you respiclick)   UGH, YES. As if the Advair diskus still not being available generic wasn't bad enough."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dtfh5,SlimSlamtheFlimFlam,3,Sun Jul 19 21:56:43 2015 UTC,"These are all very good habits to have. I can see you being an awesome tech and someone I'd enjoy working with.   -Know which drugs will be found in the refrigerator. If you're   This is an important to know. The last sentence seemed to cut off?   -Current prescription costs more than what they paid in the past? Check their profile, see if they used any discount cards/etc. in the past. I see it a lot with Vyvanse in particular.   Sometimes, especially at the beginning of the year, prices or formularies will change and that changes the price of the medication. If there's a sudden jump in price, ask if the patient has a deductible (which also resets at the beginning of the year) that they need to pay before the insurance is willing to cover that medication. Sometimes patients won't know, so I usually just tell them to call their insurance to find out (or I may call out of courtesy if time permits)  Another habit I'd like to add is to mark the bottles and their caps (so you can easily ID them especially for bottles on the bottom shelves) if you open them.  This habit is just me being anal about organization, but I have a tendency to pull one bottle at a time and put them back once I'm done counting. I only do this though if I'm the only one working with the pharmacist that day. If I'm working with someone else and we're both counting, I would usually pull all bottles first for both of us, count and then during downtime, put all bottles away."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3dtfh5,redwhite16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:38:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks! :) I really appreciate it. Sounds like you would be too! Come to Indiana. It's not so bad, I promise.  Oh man I didn't even think about deductibles, probably because I haven't worked in a January yet (I hear that's a LOT of fun with all the new insurance cards...blech!)  GREAT idea on marking the caps too! Didn't even think about that. Now I'll start doing that too.  Aaaah, it did cut off. When I went to bold some stuff I started the next point and forgot..whoopsies. Fixed. I meant that if you're not familiar with tons of drugs, or not a pharmacy student, you might not know what's in the fridge. Starting out the only thing I knew about was insulin, besides that I mainly see NuvaRing in there, I know there are several more I just haven't come across yet.   pull one bottle at a time and put them back once I'm done counting   So far I only do this when we're not busy. I'll put all the used bottles in a basket until there's a free moment or someone else gets them (angels!). Being a floater I'm slower at pulling/putting stuff back at most stores, but I'm getting quicker and doing it more often because I know how much it helps out (especially with stuff where there's only one bottle so if someone's looking for it, it might be in my collection...)

I remember back when I was in pharmacy school, lo these many years ago, and Professor Cooper (R.I.P.) was our law teacher. He was always careful to specify what was required by state law and what was federal. Someone wanted to know why this was important, given that the stricter law prevails in any case, so who cared which it was? His response was that we might wind up practicing in another state, and even in New York you might be in a Federal facility where state law doesn't apply. So someone else asked, so how do we know if it's a state law or a federal one? He thought about this a moment, and said, ""Well, just look at it for a moment, and if it's really stupid, chances are it's New York State."" When the laughter died down, he went on, ""I'll give you an example. Stupidest law on the books for 18 years running. Now you know there are three types of data that are required on the prescription. If the date's missing, you can't fill it at all; if certain other items are missing (e.g. patient's age, address), you can fill them in from your records; if other items are missing (e.g. doctor's name, drug name, dosage), you need to call the doctor to fill that in, you can't just add it in from the records. Now, one of the data you are required by New York State law to call the doctor and ask him, is the doctor's phone number.""    This took a moment to sink in, and then we were all hysterical. I mean can you imagine the conversation. ""Hi Doctor Jones, what's your phone number?"" ""Well you just called me on it, you jackass.""    (Now remember the man who told us this was a member of the New York State Board of Pharmacy for two decades.)  Although it all becomes moot next March, in New York at least, because that's when they (finally!) implement all-electronic prescribing, and the State has determined that we won't (don't?) need to keep paper copies of them anymore."

Why penalize the patient for the pharmacy not having it in stock or them not being able to afford the full prescribed quantity?   Can't really think of a good clinical reason why a rx written from 30 days couldn't be picked up as two 15 days supplies.
TalesFromThePharmacy,3czfm0,anxiouspistachio,9,Sun Jul 12 18:27:26 2015 UTC,"Edit: you edited after I posted so part of my reply doesn't make sense. I'll leave the post as is below, but add the following: we aren't choosing to penalize. That script is void by law if it cannot be completed within 72 hours. Partial fills become a diversion issue (sell part of the first half to pay for the second). My post below is more about OOS situations than can't afford the full amount situations.   It's not a penalty. It's an option. When you tell someone they forfeit the remainder, they will likely take it to another store to get it filled. I'll even call other pharmacies (in the same chain of course) to make sure they have it first.  I do acknowledge that they've already been inconvenienced by our insufficient quantity, which is why I'll call around. I know many pharmacies don't divulge that info to patients over the phone, but will to me.   If someone is prescribed 90 norco, I have 81 tabs in stock, and their directions are ""up to"" three times daily as needed, they might opt to just take what I have since they don't typically use tid unless it's a bad day. This is a reasonable trade off if someone is using their medicine properly and values convenience.   Options aren't a bad thing.   Many pharmacies don't partial CIIs at all (mine being one of them) because we can't guarantee we'll have the remainder within 72 hours.  After that point, the remainder is definitely void by law. So the patient gets the choice between ""take what we have"" and ""I'll try to find you another nearby <insert chain> that has it"""

We have licenses to protect. Some of us are up to our eyeballs or more in debt.   We're required by law to dispense no more than is written by a prescriber. We're also in many cases required by law to dispense no more than we deem reasonable and are well within our rights to ask you to find another pharmacy and refuse a prescription.   If your doctor is under-medicating you, that's not my fault. If your doctor doesn't understand addiction, that's not my fault and you should find a doctor who specializes in it. Don't scream at me about it, especially since that won't engender any response in me that makes me want to go out of my way for you. This is yet another pitfall of being the most readily accessible arm of healthcare, but that accessibility is what drew many of us to this career.   I work in a pharmacy closely related to an opiate addiction practice, and I see actual addicts every day. I have great relationships with many of the patients. That said there are a whole lot of people who say they are ""addicts"" but are out for nothing more than money or to get high. I thought I understood addiction before I took this job, but I didn't. Watch people who really do struggle day in and day out, only picking up one day's supply of suboxone every single day hoping that tomorrow is the day they can turn their back on their addiction.   Then take a phone call asking if ""y'all got any a them perc 10s? I'm allergic to everything but them yellow ones... And I live 45 minutes away and my doctor is in another state that's about an hour away from me. Oh, you caint fill em? That's BULLSHIT Y'ALL FILLED SOME 14 HOURS AND 27 MINUTES AGO I KNOW YOU DID!

I've come out of pocket a few times for our regular patients, the kind who I know are struggling and I see every day for their one day supply. I've almost always been paid back, but yeah I've been burned a couple times. It's a risk I've been willing to take a few times over a few bucks and knowing that somebody I didn't fill one days worth of suboxone might end up using again. That's an addict who deserves help.

They can legally pick up a full month's supply at a time if the prescription says so. For some patients, the prescribers make them go week to week especially if they are problem patients or very high risk.  Some patients can't afford the whole month at a time. I'm fine with this, but I won't sell anymore to a patient until however many days worth they got should be up. For example if you tell me all you can afford is to get enough for 3 days, don't come back in 30 minutes with enough for the remainder because I'm not selling you any more until the 3 days is up.   What I was talking about was patients who can afford more than one day at a time but feel like they are close to turning the corner on their addiction and every day hope that it will be the last day they need suboxone.

You're essentially saying that your judgement call based off of what, intuition, is better for the patient than what a licensed doctor who has evaluated the patient has determined. I was in a bad car accident and had to have extensive oral surgery including losing 4 front teeth, sever bone fractures (titanium screws and rods) and damaged nerves. This is not evident looking at me for the most part. So what exactly is this based on? I understand if someone comes in intoxicated or trying to fill it early, but what aspect of your training includes superseding a Drs professional opinion. Maybe if you want to diagnose patients you should go back to school. Also I there is a light script the pharmacist is not going to have their license jeopardized. What I recently had to deal with: I use my prescription properly every month and it is a take 3 as needed a day. Well I need 3 a day to function and the pharmacist had the nerve to say ""wow so you really needed 3 a day every day this month? I do not need to defend myself when I pick up my medicine. I understand the right to not fill an rx but your job is not to belittle and make judgements when you don't know the circumstances."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3cxggm,Davegrohlisthedude,7,Mon Jul 13 07:16:11 2015 UTC,"I never said ""deem necessary"" at any point.  I make it a point not to have limited interactions at my pharmacy. I'm at an independent pharmacy, not one of the big three, so I can afford to view patients as human beings and not numbers to be shuttled through as soon as possible.   I did say what I deem reasonable, and that is a question of legality and common sense. I, as before mentioned, have more riding on choosing to fill a dubious prescription or not than anybody else, including the prescriber you seem to think I'm superseding. Many people have no idea of the ridiculous prescriptions that prescribers write.   I don't want to diagnose patients, but believe it or not I have enough training, schooling and experience to recognize if a prescription makes zero sense. In a situation where somebody apparently had extensive oral surgery, lost four front teeth, had several bone fractures, titanium screws and rods and damaged nerves yet somehow appeared perfectly normal, I'm going to have a conversation with the patient or their advocate before making any decision at all about whether to fill their prescription or not.    Also I there is a light script the pharmacist is not going to have their license jeopardized.   I cannot understand this sentence and therefore cannot respond to it. Pharmacies should be using the maximum dose in order to calculate days supply (i.e. if it says take 1-2 every 4-6 hours, you assume they take the maximum as written, so calculate for 2 every 4 hours). If your pharmacist is giving you shit about it, take your business elsewhere. I don't say things like that to patients and wouldn't.   I don't just judge people from across the counter, but I do consider fill history and what makes sense, and if that makes me an asshole then so be it.

I got a little heated reading the posts from all the pharmacists, who seemed to be jaded against anyone on opiates that isn't above the age of 70. And I still think that denying someone a prescription that is valid is not reasonable based solely off of judgement without a basis that could be documented.

As a big picture question I have a ""Ain't that awful"" response.  But on an individual level I know that many of the kids I know who are taking those meds now have a chance to get through school and have a future."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3cxggm,inaseaS,3,Sat Jul 18 12:54:31 2015 UTC,The fact that you evaluated my response and think you can judge my situation saying that I need to heal on emotional control is a perfect example of the point I was trying to make anyway.
TalesFromThePharmacy,3cxggm,Davegrohlisthedude,13,Sat Jul 18 04:25:14 2015 UTC,"One of the problems in the system is that doctors will under medicate, they will not give the right meds to manage the pain. So patients will then over medicate because at that point they need the good feeling. They then run out and they have re-set the system so it takes more meds to get the pain relief.  I am not complaining about the pharmacy at all. You guys have to follow these rules and things would get a whole lot worse if you had the freedom to just hand things out. But pain is horrible and people in pain or in fear of pain are in distress. We talk of someone as tortured, but think of that. A pain patient is being tortured by their own body. All the thumb screws and instruments of torture are hidden, but they are there.  That said she gave out an human scream, at least remember that part. She is human."

It almost certainly was a violation but it isn't hard to imagine circumstances where the pharmacist that gave it out thought she was doing the right thing. Retail chains put a ton of pressure in their staff to keep people happy, frankly if pharmacists followed only the letter off the law people would be pissed. No picking up scripts for someone else unless you have a written and documented authorization on file.  Filling a prescription requires presenting an id in person and having the exact info to request it.  Lots of other things chains do to keep things reasonably convenient for customers would go out the window. But this is exactly why HIPAA has the requirement that a good faith effort be made, as there is no way to ensure compliance.  Which leads to why people are reacting in that thread the way they are. He is saying he wants the ""incompetent pharmd"" punished.  We don't know what happened. We don't know how negligent this pharmacist was. What we do know is this person is a regular poster to opiates and darknetmarkets. Chances are he is a junkie.  Anyone who has worked retail pharmacy can tell tales of junkie lies and the spin junkies put on their stories.  They have no hesitation about taking actions which would fuck pharmacy staff over just so they can get their fix.  So until I hear more, my sympathy is with the pharmacist, who may end up losing her job even if she ess deceived and didn't intentionally do anything wrong."

I have to deal with the general public at work. Most people are fine or mildly pleasant but the situation changes if an employee makes a mistake or b/c our company has pretty restrictive policies on certain items. When people can't get what they want, they will argue, scream, make threats and after they are done with that or in the process they demand to speak with the manager, their manager, etc....    When people act like that, it makes me think about the person I am interacting with wherever I go, and take into consideration what they have to deal with.  It is frustrating when prescriptions are lost, but that doesn't mean you have to treat people like trash.  Last time I checked, I wasn't perfect.  I find it goes both ways, be polite, and hope the other person is. Be a total jerk, and don't expect much more than standard service."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3cr0bl,redwhite16,11,Fri Jul 10 07:18:13 2015 UTC,"How can this be prevented in the future, and how can I continue to be a polite pharmacy customer?   When you drop off your next prescription, you explain to the pharmacist politely what has happened on multiple occasions. You say that you will stay for the entire process of them inputting the prescriptions so you can double-check that they will go on file. This may take a little while, but the pharmacist should understand based on your past situations. You may let them know that you are not in a rush to fill them, but you just want to have some immediate accountability that they are getting in your profile and not lost or set aside.    this one was not for a scheduled medication. Neither was the first one.   This is key, make sure you let the pharmacist know what prescriptions you had issues with. They will probably know that you are not trying to take advantage of them once they learn it isn't controlled.  Most pharmacists are reasonable people too. They won't think you are impolite by voicing this concern. What you presented here was very reasonable and they should understand."

TalesFromThePharmacy,3cr0bl,mskarD2,8,Fri Jul 10 04:58:39 2015 UTC,"Politely ask the pharmacist who is aware that you had dropped off the prescriptions to be placed ""on file"" at the pharmacy to call your physician and alert him that the prescriptions were misplaced.  As a pharmacist myself, I would try to do anything to accommodate you given this situation.  I'm sure the physician would re-write the prescriptions seeing as it was not your fault."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3cr0bl,SghettyCorn,10,Fri Jul 10 02:18:28 2015 UTC,"I've had it happen at my pharmacy. It's frustrating for us as techs because we remember it was handed to us and boom it's misplaced.  It's there somewhere- but somewhere can be filed with thousands of other scripts.   We called the doctors office ourselves and were very clear that we had misplaced the scripts and that it was our fault. Mistakes happen and the offices understood and gave us new scripts no problem. One was a C-II and another a C-IV. We ended up driving over to the office for the C-II script.   It's frustrating and rare, and with the volume my store does it's amazing how few times it happens.   My best advice is just talk to the techs or the rPh and just ask if they had contacted the doctor to explain the script was dropped off and then misplaced.  Good luck!"

Wish I didn't require them, but now I can at least work some and have a decent quality of life. Sometimes I do get a sigh or a look etc. b/c I am not 70+ years old and can still walk.

It’s bad for you guys as well (CYA + corporate).    So, I don't know if it's a good relationship or not. I do not ask for early refills or any of that mess.

TalesFromThePharmacy,3cr0bl,matts2,3,Fri Jul 10 06:52:05 2015 UTC,"An update: The situation was handled. The pharmacy manager was polite, professional and called me back quickly. I am not sure if they ever found the hard copy, but said that they would keep looking. He did exactly what some of the Pharmacists said here (verified it was missing, called MD and told them what happened - I was grateful that the person did say it was dropped off, then went missing (not out of blame or spite, see OP), and got a new Rx. I was kind of surprised, but it was a good thing that is was fixed w/i 24h considering how busy they are. The pharmacy manager is a pretty nice person overall. It did end up costing me a lot more money than I was prepared to spend, but that is b/c the MD keeps writing for 90 days supply, despite asking the opposite repeatedly. I figured that the pharmacist(s) and techs had to deal with enough stuff so I wasn't going to hassle them and ask that they RTS and fill only part of it. The main thing I was frustrated about was the way the insurance works (which you have no control over, nor is it your fault). I am still going to use the pharmacy. Everyone makes mistakes, including me.  TL;DR: Situation solved by polite and professional pharmacy manager. He called the MD, explained the situation and it got resolved. I think he tried hard overall to fix an error, because the response was fast.    So, if said person happens to be reading this: Thank you, sincerely. I appreciate your patience, promptness and how it was handled and resolved. I am sorry if it caused you any trouble. And, thank you to all of your staff, you guys are awesome. :)"

TalesFromThePharmacy,3chwph,moxifloxacin,3,Wed Jul 8 04:12:11 2015 UTC,For real. We have that many of the 40s on the shelf.
TalesFromThePharmacy,3chwph,JohnnyBoy11,3,Wed Jul 8 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"Before my pharmacy never got the 1000 counts. The 30 count bottles were alway the ""preferred"" package. Finally I decided to just start ordering the 1000 counts over the phone to save us all time and sanity. After about a week we were ""limited"" on ordering more big bottles and we were back to the 30 counts. ._."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3chwph,Stoddard14,6,Wed Jul 8 06:06:02 2015 UTC,"I did that at my pharmacy with rosuvustatin. We have the 1000 count bottle of 5mg, but only 30 count bottles of the 10, which we use almost as much. So I changed our order at the last second before it sent. The day we got it ""What idiot ordered the 1000 bottle?"" Two days later ""wow this is way better. Use up the 30's and don't reorder. We're gonna keep the 1000's."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3chwph,alicesfaultystars,13,Wed Jul 8 06:39:04 2015 UTC,You ordered a 1000 count of Crestor? Did you mortgage your house?

TalesFromThePharmacy,3chwph,MilkFlavoredCheerios,7,Wed Jul 8 12:43:23 2015 UTC,"This happens to you too?  When we get an order of Omeprazole, for some reason it doesn't update our inventory so we just keep getting sent 12 bottles of it until we overflow. Then someone asks about it, we fix the inventory, fill 2100 capsules 30 at a time, rinse and repeat. This happens over the course of a month or two and we don't normally catch it until it's too late."

Again, she was sweet, but when I give you short, concise, to the point answers to your questions I don't need to have everything parroted back to me.

TalesFromThePharmacy,3cbaew,random_rockets,3,Tue Jul 7 18:37:09 2015 UTC,"Hi! I'm new to this  and my friend sent me this forum but here's an interesting experience from my hospital rotation that I had for Spring 2015 in my P1 year.   I was working at a hospital that had one central pharmacy on the second floor of the main building and had separate mini pharmacies on ever floor in the other adjoined building. I was following around a P4 on the first day and we were required to do Med Recs. So out of a stack of papers he gives me a couple sheets to call the pharmacies of some patients who were admitted that morning to get their medication histories.  The first one I called was a Walmart pharmacy. When I got on the phone the first thing the pharmacist tells me when I as for the patient information be sent to the hospital was that she was too busy to bother with that and just decided to list off all the medication all in a row. I scribbled them all over the paper the P4 was wondering what was happening on the phone and the pharmacist hung up after I asked about the medication. I was so dumbfounded on how to react to that. The second patient I had to call for the pharmacist there was like. Yep sure give us a couple minutes and we will have that faxed over right away.   Next up was actually going to visit all of the patients of the stack of papers the P4 already had gotten medical lists of. And when we were going around the hospital we had one aldy who was going on and on about how she needed this one herbal supplement or she went cookoo. She even mentioned attacking her son-in-law when she didn't take it one day and then mentioned how she didn't bother to ask her doctor to change her Lasix dosage so she was under-medicating herself. The next patient was a man that neither the P4 nor I could understand a word he was saying and he couldn't tell us what pharmacy he went to so we hve zero information on what meds he took. Later we found out he got all his scripts from ExpressScripts but still... every time we talked to him it was incoherent mumbling. What's worse was when we contacted his caretaker, who is his daughter, she was just as bad as he was!  The next patient was an elderly lady who was asleep the firs time we went  to see her and the second time we went to see her she told us her correct medication list she was the most tolerable and reliant patient we had that day. Only problem was we had to talk really loud to her. The last two patients were the hardest to contact and figure out. Ever time we went to the ICU floor for these two patients Doctors were in the room for the one patient so we couldn't go in, and the other patient was knocked out most of the time. Ever time we went to her room she kept mumbling as if she was sleep talking and when we asked her which pharmacies she went to she just mumbled something were couldn't understand and then randomly started pointing toward the wall. Both the P4 and I were confused. And when he tried asking her again it was just as confusing.  Later we went back to the ICU on the 7th floor of the one building we had to climb 7 flights of stairs to get their because the elevator was out and both of us were out of breath kind of just gasping for air when we reached the top floor. We saw again the one patient's room was closed so we couldn't go see him and still didn't find out anything from his caretaker because they weren't answering he phone, and then went back to see the woman in the other room. By that time her daughter was their so we figured we could have asked her about the medications and such but nope All she knew was that her mom went to a BJs pharmacy and the rough area it was in. Had no idea about meds or anything, her mother was also asleep now since she had cardiac distress at like 5 am and was exhausted; her daughter also kept asking us what the monitors in the room meant and all we could do was just stare at her and tell her the nurses can explain them to you but all they were are just cardiac readings. So back down to the pharmacy we went and called the superposed BJs after we googled the place on your phones. And well... she only got 3 meds there and it was more than two years ago that she last got them refilled. So it finally clicked why she was suddenly in the hospital since she hasn't been taking her maintenance meds at all.  And after that we ended up calling the one patient we couldn't see at all that day. Turns out the patient was unconscious and we called his caretaker who was his niece or something around those lines and she finally gave us the answers we needed. Turns out that he had his meds scattered around his house so she called us back after finding them all and reading the directions off to us. We ended up finishing what we could of the Med Recs and updating them in the computer system for the doctors to read.   The two of us spend probably 5 hours just going around and trying to get information as well as delivering stuff to people in the ICU and waiting for phone calls. The day ended with us pretty much listening to some student reports by the P4s and then leaving early since all the work we had to do was done for the day so me and the P2 who was assigned to a different group of P4s went home early on the first day of rotation.  The funny things that happened that day though were the P4 and I (a P1) had the whole junoir/senoir short/tall combo going on and the the P2 who was there was done with her work at like 10 am and was bored all day when the two of us were busy all day. Usually med recs take a short time period but they were abnormally long for the two of us. The last thing I want to mention is the 7 flights of stairs really did kill us, we were so out of breath by the time we reached the ICU we were like ""We need to really get some exercise we are so out of shape..."" We were still winded by the time we reached the pharmacy again. We spend most of the day running up to the ICU sadly enough.   All the while Flu season was going on too!"
TalesFromThePharmacy,3cbaew,chucktpharmd,4,Tue Jul 7 04:01:33 2015 UTC,Reminds me of a hospital I interned in the respiratory ICU was on the 7th floor. After lunch was the most painful if I packed too much food. A cardiologist there is famous for making residents walk the 7 flights while explaining a concept or patient file. If they were out of breath he would tell them he would fail them if they can't get in shape enough by the end of their rotation. Lead by example I guess lol. He eventually became one of the cardiologist for the Canadian Olympics team.

I strive to be the kind of Pharmacy employee who will always give you a genuine smile even if the Pharmacy is falling apart around me. So, I'm sure you're fine watching us work. Why I say that, is that I'm fairly certain we can tell the difference between pure interest in our profession and anger that we didn't blow off every other human to do everything for them first. So, no need to be sorry. We thank you.   To answer your questions... Yes, we count on little trays, usually by 5's. Many Pharmacies have electronic counting devices that do a decent job, but for most controlled medications, there's nothing more accurate than double counting on the little tray.   We have everything from small vials to large bottles for medications depending on what medication is being dispensed. I love being ""supply rich"" in the Pharmacy so we don't have to worry if we have the right sizes for things.   If a pill or capsule is dropped, there is usually a ""general"" bottle that they are put in. When that it full, it goes off to be destroyed. We try to be as careful and sanitary as possible. We use quite a bit of isopropyl alcohol to wipe down counters/phones/counting trays, etc. to keep everything clean.   Depending on the size of the Pharmacy, there are thousands of drugs back there. Some of them smell really bad like a certain brand of metformin. It reeks of fish. Then there is one that smells like buttered popcorn. Usually though, there is little odor.

TalesFromThePharmacy,3bsemk,wrathofkahn,18,Wed Jul 1 22:11:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Yesterday I was working a grocery Pharmacy that was short staffed and we were slammed. No one had had a break for hours and we were running. The Pharmacy is near 6 U-Scans and there was a significant line for them. We had just finished with our own line of Pharmacy customers and had gone back to processing now overdue waiters and answering the never ending phone calls.   This guy walks up to pick up and slams his basket on the counter. I went over, smiled and asked his name and birthdate. He told me it was none of my business and to just ""ring me up."" As nicely as I could, I told him that I couldn't do that and pointed toward the U-Scan.   ""You have a F#K@G!! REGISTER right here so DO YOUR JOB!""   Thankfully it was the end of my day, and the PIC sternly dealt with this self entitled asshat. Not sure if he even got his groceries, but I can guarantee they weren't rung up in the Pharmacy."

I always feel like an ass because I end up yelling all day to make sure people hear me, or even if someone heard me the first time I repeat myself anyway because I'm so used to it. The question irritates me so much that one time I was watching a tv episode with a running gag where two characters couldn't hear each other and kept asking ""what"" and it gave me such bad anxiety I had to shut it off."

I never understood why people try to fight me when I say the prescription is not at the pharmacy. It's not here. I have no reason to lie when I say we haven't received it...majority of the time it's something they or their doctor has done, and they still look annoyed with me when I explain the situation to them.

Serious question, can someone run me through why it does take so long to get a prescription filled?  I think to the stupid masses (which I am a part of), it would just involve taking the pills from the shelf, doing a sticker for them and that's it."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3bsemk,SirNoobs,15,Sat Jul 4 12:55:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  It takes a long time because we receive the prescription, have to input everything (doctor's name, address, all the official numbers associated, instructions on how to take it, quantity, refills, any extra information) and then it goes to the pharmacist to check over the inputted info. Once that's done, it goes to fill. At my pharmacy, we usually have about 20-30 prescriptions sitting in fill on average. People don't see the doctor's called in prescriptions, those electronically sent over, transfers from other pharmacies, and the refill requests from customers. They see an empty pharmacy, but we actually have tons of orders coming in from other places. After filling, the pharmacist has to check over it one last time and then all the paper work is printed.  That's if it all goes smoothly.  Sometimes, insurance doesn't go through, so we have to call the insurance company. Sometimes, the doctor doesn't write clear/correct instructions, so we have to call the doctor. We get put on hold for 10-15 minutes usually.  So yep, it's just really complicated and has so many checks to make completely sure that the patient is getting the right thing at the right price with the right instructions.   I never understood it all until I started working in a pharmacy, either, so it's not a stupid question to ask and I completely get why you ask :)"
TalesFromThePharmacy,3bsemk,upsidedownbackwards,4,Thu Jul 2 00:27:51 2015 UTC,"Adding to what the others have said - even if everything goes right with your prescription, there may be others ahead of you (even if they're not waiting by the pharmacy and it looks like you're the only one waiting, they could be elsewhere in the store or waiting in the parking lot) who are having issues that we're already working on sort of delaying the queue from proceeding smoothly"

The pharmacist does not work for a chain though, she and her husband opened up an independent pharmacy. So essentially, she created her own job if you look at it that way."

However, sponsoring for a VISA is really no big deal. This was can last up to maximum of 8 years. If, however, sponsorship fr GREEN CARD through work is needed - very freaking hard... you seriously need to be a specialist of unique abilities, like a great scientist, it's pretty much not applicable at all to retail pharmacists."

A great gross refers to a group of 1728 items (a dozen gross or a cubic dozen).   A small gross  or a great hundred  refers to a group of 120 items (ten dozen).   A gross may be abbreviatied as ""gr"" or ""gro"".  The continued use of these numbers in measurement and counting represents a continuation of the tradition of the duodecimal number system in everyday life  and has encouraged groups such as the Duodecimal Society of America to advocate for a wider use of such a numbering system in place of decimal.

TalesFromThePharmacy,3aoj0k,jt4,-5,Mon Jun 22 12:40:04 2015 UTC,"As someone who works in a physicians office that only prescribes Suboxone or Subutex; I have had countless frustrating experiences with pharmacies / pharmacists with very little logical reasoning for them.    I understand that many pharmacists have problems with Suboxone Clinics and have negative views of them. Our ops manager and myself have made every effort we can to forge relationships with these people so they understand we are a small facility (not a big company with tons of locations in a bunch of states) that doesn't tolerate our patients being rude to pharmacies and will discharge them because of it. We commonly bring cookies and treats to pharmacies our patients use a lot as a thank you because we know it's not an easy job and all of the big chain pharmacies have been utter assholes to us. So we forged a great personal relationship with a mom and pop pharmacy just down the street and send the majority of our patients to them.    I've had pharmacists be rude as fuck to me. It's one thing to do it to a patient but to a physician's assistant? Wtf.    My biggest pain is when pharmacists try to tell me I'm not doing my job re: prior authorization when their rejection code is one that only they can address with the pharmacy help desk and the fax they send me specifically says that. So they shout at me despite my informing them I have an approved PA on file and am looking at it. They say ""No you need to call the insurance"". So, I humor them and call the insurance. Spend 20+ minutes on hold and they tell me the pharmacy needs to call the pharmacy help desk. So I call the pharmacy back and tell them this again and they finally do it. So a 2 minute problem turns into a 30+ minute problem because the pharmacy thinks they know everything there is to know about PAs. It's my primary job. I'm on the phone with insurances (especially medicaid) every single day. Stop faxing me the wrong forms, stop telling me I don't know what I'm doing. I've never worked for a pharmacy but I know what all of the rejection codes mean because I've seen them all. I know what I'm doing. So instead of arguing with me because you hate Suboxone Clinics; why not just humor me and listen because I want your job to goes smooth just as you do because you are who our patient deals with when they leave and I realize our patients can often times be complete jackasses.    There's no reason to be a dick to me, another health care professional. I'm not here to make your job more difficult and stop assuming we're a shady clinic because we prescribe Suboxone."

I'm not here to make your job more difficult and stop assuming we're a shady clinic because we prescribe Suboxone.   Conversely, understand that your patients can make our lives extraordinarily difficult compared to the standard medical office.   In my area we have 3-4 large pain management clinics, with one that works solely as a detox. There is only one of those clinics we're actually happy to see their scripts. The others are notorious for not caring about doctor/pharmacy shopping done by their patients. It has happened many times that I'm made into the bad guy because I have to point out to the office that a patient is breaking their pain management contract, and the office says ""just fill it"" without looking at their prescription history. I've had scripts for suboxone I've refused to fill because the patient has been getting it regularly at 3, 4 other pharmacies, and the clinic STILL is very difficult about our refusal to fill.   Now, I'm not saying that your clinic is like this, or that there aren't good clinics. One clinic in our area is amazing, they keep great records, and they always have our back when we have to have difficult conversations with their patients. What I will say is that it needs to be a partnership between pharmacy and clinic, and that both sides can take out frustrations on the other."

I completely agree with you and we've tried and tend to have no luck with big chain pharmacies. It's the mom and pop ones that tend to be far more receptive and open to creating a relationship with us.    We like when our pharmacies call us to say ""hey something doesn't look right"" and we tell them we appreciate the call or if they tell us patients are being rude to them, being sketchy in the parking lot; if the patient has never had issues we tell them this is your one and only warning. If we get word you're being an ass to a pharmacy, you'll be discharged without a taper.

These doctors that give addicts a months worth of suboxone/subutex and not expect them to abuse it or trade for something they can abuse are delusional, and killing people.  Maybe when I call an office to complain, maybe it is because I have to deal with the scumbags at the pill mills.  Maybe your office is good, but after just 5 years of being a Sr. Tech, I have yet to see a good suboxone clinic. Every single one has been shut down and taken doctor licenses."

A patient had walked up to the window and handed him the ring and asked for a refill for it. He wasn't sure what it was, so the tech went up to the pharmacist with the ring and told him the patient needed a refill on this and he wasn't sure what it was."

When they ""order"" a CII drug they're basically submitting a request to order it, rather than just telling their supplier what they need. There was some trouble several years ago which resulted in a multimillion dollar fine from the DEA which is why Walgreens is super careful about controlled drugs now. Also their new supplier and old inventory system sucks so that contributes to the problem.   TL;DR: it's not totally on the pharmacists at that store. Corporate control is a big factor."

My RXM has ordered specific manufacturers of fentanyl for one of our regulars without issue. We are a high volume store in our area though so I'm not sure if we are allowed to order more than others...

TalesFromThePharmacy,3agu77,s0yj0y,15,Sat Jun 20 03:52:15 2015 UTC,"If you explain to the new pharmacy that your current pharmacy is having trouble ordering and you are hoping for more consistency, they should be fine with accepting you as a patient. Have a set of questions ready so you know what to expect such as: can you special order certain brands and will you order the medication if I call ahead prior to my appointment. Be open and clear about why you need this. Tell them exactly what you wrote here. Its actually widely known that certain brands of fentanyl stick better than others. The pharmacy I work at is allowed to special order certain brands, but it can vary by location. It is very important to make sure the new pharmacy can special order certain brands and that you call every month at least a few business days ahead of time and remind them which brand you need. It sounds silly, but we help hundreds of people every day and need patients to take responsibility, which it sounds like you are trying to do.   I say call around and switch if a pharmacy is willing to be more accommodating for you."

TalesFromThePharmacy,3agu77,nobodez,-3,Thu Jul 9 06:03:12 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's not that difficult to get a CII to come in regularly at Walgreens. Order a couple days before the CII order comes from ABC, make,sure you get the ceiling limit tool to accept your two or three item order (I think CIIs are limited to two per order, but I could be wrong) and then it comes in. If you have a regular patient, it's simply a matter of ordering it ahead of time.  Of course, OP is either lying or sketchy, since they should be going to their doctor when the Fentanyl 25s run out, and they should still have some leftover 12s from when the previous month was delayed, meaning that as long as the chain pharmacy they go to is consistent on the ordering, the delay should match up."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3agu77,Imnotreallytrying,8,Sat Jun 20 17:40:05 2015 UTC,"Oh thanks. I'm not lying or sketchy. I do go to the pain doctor when my patches run out, and sometimes I may have an extra because of scheduling. But sometimes I don't have any because of scheduling too. I don't take more patches than I have to, because I don't need or want to. I started this thread just to understand from the professionals what was going on and if it was something that could be dealt with, but I've gotten a lot of downvotes which are unwarranted.

TalesFromThePharmacy,3agu77,overrule,2,Mon Jun 22 19:48:19 2015 UTC,Can the pharmacist fill my prescription with a different brand if my script says mylan requested?
TalesFromThePharmacy,3agu77,sfvalet,16,Sat Jun 20 03:25:08 2015 UTC,"""Requested"" and ""DAW"" (dispense as written) are 2 different things. If the Pharmacy cannot get Mylan due to supplier stock, then they can fill with something else if it just says ""requested."" I suggest you have your doctor discuss your ordering issues (both brand and patch strengths) directly with the Pharmacy. It's unfair to you that you should have to deal with this on your own.   Normally, I would say to have the Pharmacy call the doctor, but from what I read here, you would have a huge hassle asking them to do that. Seriously, I work in Pharmacy and would be mortified if my Pharmacist spoke to a patient like you are describing.   Edit: I also wanted to add that just because a doctor orders something, it doesn't automatically mean it exists. We often see prescriptions for drugs and strengths that haven't existed for years. Or even better, never existed."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3agu77,oomio10,2,Sat Jun 20 03:46:14 2015 UTC,"I won't claim to be an expert on which fentanyl strengths are most popular, but to be honest, I can't remember ever seeing a script for 12 mcg more than once or twice. 25 and 50 are the ones I've seen the most, with the occasional 37.5. That would explain why the pharmacy always has your 25, because they regularly replenish the stock of that, because it's a relatively popular item. On the other hand, the 12s are not, so they don't bother.  Ordering a C-II medication ahead of time for a patient with a monthly prescription is at a pharmacist's discretion. Some specific stores may have a blanket policy of not doing so but (as far as I am aware) no chain outright forbids it. If you want to stay with this pharmacy, next time you drop off the script and they tell you they will order it, ask again if there is any way for them to order it ahead of time for you. Ask if it would help to have the doctor contact them; the doc could tell them he/she intends to keep you on this strength for [however long]. If the pharmacy seems open to that, you may have an in. If they're not, their hands are clearly tied up in red tape.  In that case, I would recommend trying out another pharmacy chain or an independent (as it might help with your manufacturer-specific need as well), and as much as it might suck, transfer all your prescriptions there. Or, at least, get both fentanyl strengths there. Most pharmacies are uncomfortable filling just C-IIs for a patient; they'd prefer you're getting all of your meds with them. But definitely suss them out first. Explain your difficulty with the other pharmacy, ask them about ordering specific manufacturers and ordering ahead of time. Of course, don't expect that they'll immediately order 12 boxes to have on hand for you as a new patient; phrase it like, 'If I come with a script for this monthly, would you eventually be open to trying to keep it in stock for me?' If the pharmacist seems receptive to that, then you're golden. If not, maybe try elsewhere."

Also I have problems swallowing. I take 500mg naproxen twice a day, and there are lots of manufacturers (presumably it's out of patent so generic can be made). Only one is a small and smooth enough tablet for me to swallow reliably. I've told my pharmacy this & asked if they can please get  that brand - they just said no, they order naproxen from their supplier and get whatever they are given. Rarely it is that brand, but usually not. I'm sick of gagging on other brands and it means I'm embarrassed to take my tablets in public when necessary.   Pharmacists, esp UK ones, please please advise.   Thanks to OP for raising this. I hope I'm adding to the conversation, not derailing it."
TalesFromThePharmacy,3agu77,sloppy_lobster,10,Sun Jun 21 01:56:17 2015 UTC,"For most chains, it's not an option on what manufacturers we get. There are preferred ones for each different chain, and you rarely can order outside of that. For example, at my job, if I tried to order Lamotrigine from the manufacturer Teva, it wouldn't allow me to, and automatically sub to a different manufacturer.  This is the situation for OP. I know that Walgreens cannot order Mylan fentanyl, their supplier doesn't allow them to unfortunately. So it's not the pharmacists fault, or even the chain's fault, it's the supplier's, and I really do feel for patients that get screwed over by that.

TalesFromThePharmacy,39mj70,Ranger33,3,Sat Jun 13 01:15:14 2015 UTC,I had a women call one time asking who all looks the the prescription and i told her that was available to anyone in the pharmacy because not just one person does the whole process of filling it. then she started freaking out and asking why everyone could see it.

TalesFromThePharmacy,39ml9l,onmytip,12,Fri Jun 12 20:20:46 2015 UTC,At that rate wouldn't it just be simpler to do the PA?!
TalesFromThePharmacy,39ml9l,hashbrownash,9,Sat Jun 13 02:56:49 2015 UTC,I encountered a doctor who didn't understand a PA. Our chain generates a fax with a message on the bottom with the patient's plan phone number and their ID number and tells the prescriber to either initiate a PA or prescribe a different drug.   This guy just signs the piece of paper and faxes it back to us. I call the plan to see if a PA was initiated and sure enough: nope.
TalesFromThePharmacy,39ml9l,SirNoobs,11,Sun Jun 14 04:48:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, I know this idiocy exactly. They see Pharmacy at the top and assume we're nagging them for refills, they scribble ""OK X1"" and sign it and fax it back.   I circle Prior Authorization and draw a bunch of arrows to the part they didn't read and fax it back to them.   I never hear anything about it again."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39ml9l,amileandahalf,4,Sun Jun 14 05:33:43 2015 UTC,That's EXACTLY what happens most of the time....

TalesFromThePharmacy,39ml9l,Chobitpersocom,5,Mon Jun 22 01:42:55 2015 UTC,"Yup, we had an office that was notorious for sending any fax sent to them regarding PA's with something to the effect of: office policy is that any prescription that requires prior authorization requires the patient to call their insurance and have them fax us the required forms. Basically their lazy asses couldn't be bothered to call the insurance and wanted us to explain the concept of prior auths to patients to the point where patients can explain the reason for their call and the reason why they had to call instead of the office. Yeah, try explaining that to an eighty seven year old with Alzheimers. So, instead of doing your job you make it our job to communicate to the patients that it was their job to call the Medicare Part D plan that doesn't cover the fancy new combo drug or rebranded Claritin/Clarinex garbage that is an one-off that you should know wouldn't be covered in the first place. Yeah, funny how once we informed our patient of what was really going on they weren't pleased about your ""office policy."""
TalesFromThePharmacy,39ml9l,Bibliophilist,2,Tue Jun 16 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"I find it funny because if a pharmacy does the PA, it would need to be a written request and requires the doctor's signature and would take weeks to process... or... they can call it in and it will be done over the phone and instantly processed...

The lady was LIVID that my sister did not know what the heck it was, and after 5 minutes of going back and forth and my sister insisting that this lady double check what the drug was, she comes back and says it's ""doxycycline."" so yeah, we all really hate talking on the phone too."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,VioletteIce,3,Fri Jun 12 14:51:32 2015 UTC,"When I had gallbladder surgery last year, I went to the drive thru pharmacy very early the next morning to get my pain meds. The doctor didn't write something down correctly, and as it was a narcotic, it couldn't be changed and I would need a new written prescription. So there I am, still kinda groggy from anesthesia, in pajamas in the drive thru...and have to drive six miles and back to the doctor's office to get a new prescription. Of course he didn't understand so there was some back and forth on the phone with the pharmacy so there I sat in my jammies looking and feeling like death. One wrong thing on the written prescription and they won't fill it. I'd like to thank all the druggies and addicts who have made all this hassle necessary for those of us who just need pain relief after surgery."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,LadyA052,6,Fri Jun 12 05:41:08 2015 UTC,"I do understand how hard it is for people. I have to turn away people getting out of major surgery that will be on pain meds for a month max. It sucks and makes me feel shitty but there is nothing I can do.

TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,LadyA052,1 point,Tue Jun 23 10:13:51 2015 UTC,Yup its because my pharmacy has been investigated before (twice) before I started working there. I would say though it's more of our suppliers rule than the DEAs. We got reallllly lucky this supplier took is on when everyone else was turning us away because of the investigations so we now have a limit on our c2 orders every month and if we go over they will drop us and we most likely will be investigated again.  Edit: yes USA
TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,VioletteIce,0,Tue Jun 23 13:16:52 2015 UTC,"I had some residual pain after a while, and asked my doctor if I could have one refill. At first she flatly refused....c'mon, I'm a 62-year-old woman hurting from surgery, not your street corner druggie. So...get this...she gives me a prescription for FIVE hydrocodone. Five. I get to Walgreens and the pharmacist raised his eyebrows, like, Seriously? I just shrugged...all that paperwork and hassle for five pills."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,LadyA052,5,Sun Jun 14 02:55:58 2015 UTC,"I understand your view on the matter, but to be completely honest, there isn't a single good reason for a doctor's office to continuously write prescriptions for narcotics incorrectly or without all necessary information on them. It's part of their job to know the regulations and abide by them. I get that you can go with the ""we're all human"" argument and that IS true, but I see the same doctors doing the same thing over and over and over and no matter how many times you tell them, they don't stop fucking it up. At some point, the blame needs to be laid where it belongs. If a Dr. can't write a prescription with all required information on it at least 98% of the time, they have no business being a Dr. or writing prescriptions. Period. If they have a pain patient and are prescribing a narcotic or any kind of controlled substance, it IS their responsibility to write the Rx legibly and to whatever legal standard is required for that type of drug. It's not rocket science, it IS their job."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,frozengiblet,0,Mon Jun 15 06:42:33 2015 UTC,"Actually it had something to do with the dosage, he chose a dosage that wasn't covered by my insurance for some reason. He knew I was on MediCal yet prescribed something I couldn't get."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,SirNoobs,2,Tue Jun 16 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"Well, in THAT case, it isn't the Doctor's job to know exactly what is and isn't covered by every insurance company. Sure, they have a general idea of what drugs MOST insurances don't cover, because the pharmacy will notify them and ask for a prior authorization or an item change if it's not covered and is expensive. In the case of narcotics, there is no way to get around the part where you have to go back to the office to pick up a new Rx though. There are hundreds of insurances in any given area, and the responsibility to know what is and isn't covered by your plan is between you and your insurance company. It is in no way something the Doctor or the pharmacy could possibly know before submitting a claim to see if it's covered. I would suggest for the future that you request a copy of your prescription drug formulary from your insurance company. If you can access your insurance online, you can also print it from there. That way when you do need a new prescription from your doctor, you can hand them your formulary and they can hand-pick a drug for your condition that is covered by your insurance. It will save you both a lot of time and trouble."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,frozengiblet,-1,Thu Jun 18 04:58:54 2015 UTC,"The more I think about it and remember, I believe he had written vicodin on the prescription, which isn't covered, instead of hydrocodone, which is. Something about me telling him I wanted vicodin? which I never did. I only go to MediCal doctors, who should know what is covered by MediCal."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39g7ik,vastmind876,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:37:58 2015 UTC,"Because MediCal doctors only see MediCal patients? I've never seen or heard of any doctors that only work 'with' or 'for' only one insurance plan, so that is a completely foreign idea to me. (Possible, yes. Likely? Doubt it.) Just because your doctor works somewhere your plan is covered does not necessarily mean they work FOR that plan alone. Vicodin IS hydrocodone/apap, so is Norco, and Lortab. The only difference between them is the variation in strengths they come in. I'm sorry, but the more you talk and come up with excuses and new stories, the more obvious it is that you are too ignorant on this topic to be commenting on it or upset about it. You're upset BECAUSE you have no idea what you're talking about. There are people here upset for real reasons that are valid, and I can empathize with them and their situations. Being blatantly ignorant on your healthcare doesn't earn sympathy or empathy from others. It just makes you a problem patient."

TalesFromThePharmacy,398q56,gerroff,8,Wed Jun 10 13:04:53 2015 UTC,"The state insurance here has a line in it that says that if you can't afford your copay at the time, the pharmacy must still give you the medication, but can ask for the copay in the future, since after x number of dollars in the year, they make your copay $0. Some of our customers were able to turn that into ""I never pay for my prescriptions"". I especially love the ones that have 25 prescriptions, which means I have to go line by line and void their $1 copay, then price modify it to $0 25 times over. The best parts? There's a reward system that every 10 Rxs they get a coupon for front store purchases, plus at the start of every year they ask for the medication copay history printout for tax deduction purposes. Theres one who even specifies ""Make sure it says what I'm charged, not what I actually pay. I never pay for my prescriptions"".  When they have Medicare we have to collect the copay since it's Federal, and so we've had a few that get all huffy that their copay went from ~$4.00 down to $1.20 because that means that it's Medicare and they have to pay it. Had one lady say ""Darn it, I have to tell them I make more money so that they take me off the Medicare so that I won't have to pay for my prescriptions anymore.""  Don't even get me started on the one who had his mother come in with her ID (since he doesn't have an ID) and when she went to pull out money and insisting she pay the copays started yelling at her about ""I never pay for my prescriptions, don't pay for them, just refuse and they have to give it to me, it's not like it affects anyone, this guy doesn't care"" I just wanted to be like ""Actually sir the pharmacy loses money both on the billing when the insurance doesn't pay the entire difference, plus your copay when you IOU it and never pay for it, which leads to us losing hours.  To Be Fair There are a lot of customers with that insurance that actually cannot afford to pay their copays, which I am more than happy to waive. Some of them even come back to pay for them, wherein I explain to them that thank you for actually following through on the intent of the law, but it's really harder to re-charge for the copay than it is to just take the hit. (There is a way to do it, but it requires printing a new label, manually typing in the 20 digit barcode, confirming twice on the screen, and getting a manager's override.)  TL;DR - We have a some scum that learned to cheat the system, but I still appreciate the loophole for those who need it (AKA it was actually designed for)"

Vyvanse, don't care.  2mg alprazolam is a shitty drug, and is only used because you want it for the street value, or because your doctor is completely out of date on the standard of care.  Every other benzo is better in terms of tolerance/withdrawal/safety effects, and in the two years since I've been licensed, I have not had a single patient who was on it that wasn't a problem patient."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39a6ka,tgnostik,5,Fri Jun 12 02:08:32 2015 UTC,"A problem patient being one that is simply seeking drugs for their recreational and or street value, or one that is also problematic in other ways?     I rarely take the alprazolam as on the days I do take any Vyvanse/Adderall it is much more easy for me to get ready for bed and actually fall asleep (and don't want to depend on it or take it often). But I do have a terrible time with sleep and sometimes will have a couple weeks where I can't much at all. I have been prescribed zaleplon, lorazepam, clonazepam and zolpidem and have tried a LOT of other sleeping meds (OTC and perscription) as well as various methods/approaches and herbal stuff. I exercise a lot and am very healthy. Alprazolam has actually worked better than any other drug! It helps me get to sleep as long as I am trying hard to, and it wears off quickly enough so that when I wake up I am not groggy and feel like I actually slept rather than simply having been in some funky drugged out 'sleep'-like state. Unfortunately this means I sometimes wake up and can't fall asleep for hours/at all, but its way better than anything else.    So while I may be a 'problem patient' in that I rarely take over 20mg of Adderall/Vyvanse, I felt like I should mention that alprazolam has actually been the only prescription drug that has helped me deal with sleep issues well. I've never taken it consistently enough to have any withdrawals other than rebound insomnia - even when I know I won't be able to sleep I won't take it for too many days in a row (luckily I rarely have to make this decision).    While my doctor was hesitant to prescribe it, and even more so to later prescribe 2mg/day, she definitely is 'out of date' or out of touch. IDK how any prescription sleep drug is the answer for a patient supposedly taking 110mg of Vyvanse/Adderall a day.    I do know that it is incredibly dangerous and addictive, and that my case is most likely rare. I have been completely honest - I hope the fact that I am prescribed way more than I take doesn't discredit me completely because alprazolam has been exponentially better than anything else at helping me deal with my sleep issues.       This being r/TalesFromThePharmacy, I feel that anyone reading might enjoy something my doctor told me. Apparently, the DEA contacted my doctor and informed her that another one of her patients had been stupid enough to be seeing multiple doctors for the same drugs and filling all of his or her scripts at different pharmacies. I think that he or she was doing this in at least two states though I'm not sure about that. I have no idea how they thought that was going to work out..."
TalesFromThePharmacy,39a6ka,tgnostik,5,Fri Jun 12 03:13:15 2015 UTC,"A problem patient is usually ""recreational/street value"" patient, but can also be a ""patient got a 30 day supply 23 days ago, and will be trying to sneak that refill on the 23rd day every single month, whether it because they're selling them or that they're taking WAY more than the doctor prescribed""  If you're prescribed way more than you actually take, I get that that happens often - and assuming you fill it as you need it, that's not something that goes unnoticed.  If you fill a 30 day supply every 45-50 days or so, I'd view it much different than (every other patient) someone who refills it every 27 days on the dot because they know that's the earliest we will fill it.  I have the utmost respect for psych doctors, as I recognize that it's an unappreciated field and the nature of the condition means there isn't a good set of guidelines for treatment - a lot of psych is ""throw shit at a wall and see if it works, adjust as necessary (a quote from the psych attending who I rotated with) - but outpatient psych doctors are often some of the most trusting of their patients, which means they're the ones that most often get scammed by those who are getting multiple scripts from multiple doctors.  A lot of people do get away with it - I actually caught a physician, of all people, who I'd been filling for for months, and had gotten 240 zolpidem at 5 pharmacies every month.  I had a crisis of faith that day, wondering how many scripts that I hadn't been super vigilant on had been scamming me.  I still don't know."

Are you saying that you think it was because of Seroquel or because of schizophrenia/bipolar disorder/the patients' conditions.    Because of all of the stuff that happened when the patent came up for Adderall and there was a bunch of controversy over the content of a couple different generics that the composition can be slightly different. I know nothing about Seroquel, (other than what it is used to treat) are you saying that it was because of the generics that people had bad reactions to it, or just that more people were prescribed it/came to pick it up? I would have thought that once the patent was lost they'd start pushing patients on Seroquel over to whatever the new, patented Seroquel-like drug."

Fast forward a few years, records have been sent from college to doctor, who explains to me that wasn't an allergic reaction but normal reaction, and since I'm in the middle of a bad asthma exacerbation, they prescribe prednisone for me.  I have filled, in the past five years, probably 40 scrips for prednisone due to my asthma deteriorating so greatly and having so many serious exacerbations. I've been hospitalized four times in the past five years...all asthma-related.  All of a sudden yesterday the pharmacist refused to fill the prednisone! They finally noticed my scrip listed prednisone as an allergy. Even though they have filled it for me a dozen times, I had to have the DR office call and inform him the allergy listed wasn't a true allergy. Doc had to alter records, send a new scrip.

The look on their face when I ask what pharmacy to transfer to as I pick up the phone is always worth it. I have yet to have a single person call my bluff.  I don't get paid to put up with their shit. I don't get paid per patient. I don't get paid per prescription. I get paid to provide healthcare to patients, and if they don't want to be a patient of mine that's fine with me. I know I sound jaded and probably like a terrible pharmacist, but I'm not. I just treat people how they treat me and my staff."

Since I don't take any of these on a daily basis but like to have them with me just in case, I keep a seperate pill box full of them. On my last trip to see my parents, I was gone for 3 weeks, so I just filled up the pill box and had it in my purse. Somehow, I left the entire thing on one of my flights, probably digging for my other pills or snacks.   I lost prob 50 out of my 60 vicodin and who knows how many of thr rest. Tried to call the airline but of course, no one turned it in. I was actually too embarrassed that I was so irresponsible... so I never told my doc. I only get about 60 to 90 vicodin every 6-ish months or so anyway. It CAN happen, though."

I thought I had lost a brand new prescription of a non controlled, non addictive drug (little blue pill. Not that little blue pill) the day after I got it. Turned out to of fallen off my desk at home, but I had left for work already.  Pharmacy called to get it refilled after work, on my way there when my roommate (who I had told about it) found it."

I meant people who lose a random number of pills out of a bottle, like they lost 30 pills out of a 90 count bottle. Sorry I should've specified! One time a lady told me she ""accidentally"" dropped 30 of 90 OxyContin in her car and they all rolled under the seat and she didn't notice until the next day when they had all melted, so she needed me to replenish her 30.

Dude is too soon by 13 days, insurance will let it go through today (May 28th).    ""I'LL PAY CASH FOR IT!'  I explain that controls aren't sold early at our store unless the doctor calls us and we can document that he/she said it was okay to fill early.  No exceptions.  ""THIS IS AN EMERGENCY!""  I tell him to have the doctor call us, then.  ""PAGE MY DOCTOR NOW!""  Nope,  this is not how this shit works.  I tell him that we do NOT page the doctor for early refills on controls.  If he wants it early, he's gotta bug the doctor.  I am not doing it for him.    ""I GUESS I'LL JUST DIE THEN!""  And he hung up.  As of Monday, the last day I worked, the rx was still in reject too soon status.

TalesFromThePharmacy,37jm4b,Idiotsandcheapskate,4,Thu May 28 05:45:23 2015 UTC,"The closest I've come to discussing that is when my pharmacist and I agreed that we think it should be legalized. However, I know that every person I work with is very against drugs, and most of them don't even drink. Although I don't smoke anymore, I used to. I think it's super frowned upon in this particular profession especially because we deal with drugs, so there's sometimes a viewpoint that if you use one, you'll use em all, and you can't be trusted around controlled drugs.  It sucks but I'd definitely continue to keep it secret. As long as it isn't affecting your work, and it doesn't sound like it is, then it shouldn't really ever be an issue hopefully."

So he came in to pick it up and started yelling at the cashier about how now because of us he couldn't pick up both C2's on the same day and he didn't want to come back every four days and etc.  Then the cashier told him she couldn't help with that so he went over to consultation and started yelling at the pharmacist.  Ok maybe he wasn't yelling.  But he was talking so loud that everyone in the store knew what his problem was.  Good thing HIPAA doesn't apply to the customers.

The trick is to be firm, confident, and honest (even though saying ""We don't have it"" is the easiest explanation) when you tell your patients something.

Eventually we got him to leave, but holy shit he was one of the worst I've ever had. Drug addicts are dicks. I've learned to just ignore them, and once I've explained the situation to them, if they continue to be an asshole and yell, I just walk away from them and ignore them until they leave.

There are a couple crooked docs in our area, and while some other pharmacies around here won't fill their scripts, we pretty much always do. Our PIC says that she can only refuse scripts on a case-by-case basis, that we can't just refuse a script because of who wrote it unless corporate says so. I don't think she's technically wrong, I just really hate servicing obvious druggies. If you complain about it too much around her she will say things like ""you never know how much pain someone is in"" or ""you're not their doctor, you don't know what they were on before"".... Again, she's not wrong, but it doesn't make it feel better. I guess that's just her way of staying sane while doing this, but I wish we as techs could just refuse to have anything to do with it."

They don't understand the fact we can't risk our license because they took too many and ran out sooner than what they should have. And we also can't override insurance or if the doctor specifically writes that it must last x amount of days. I now work in a hospital where I fortunately don't have to deal with this issue. But when I worked retail I just kind of let it roll off my shoulders! It gets old though, so I understand your frustration because you feel like you have this conversation multiple times a day!"

TalesFromThePharmacy,37h5t2,Rxasaurus,4,Thu May 28 03:43:55 2015 UTC,The OP very clearly stated that the law where they are states that they can't fill it before day 30.

Check with the state boards of your state. We had a State board Representative come in and tell us that day 29 fills are no longer allowed due to new state laws and if they see it again they will fine us for every time it is done. A year ago we did them, but now we are no longer allowed. Welcome to the real world. According to their fill they still have medication, so they should not need it. It is to prevent people from having any extra medication left over."

No early refills are coming from me. Take the med as prescribed and there should be no issue. If you need more, work that out with your doctor so your RX reflects the increase so I can fill it without fear of the DEA or board swooping in.  *autocorrect"
TalesFromThePharmacy,37h5t2,dsmV,12,Thu May 28 04:41:27 2015 UTC,"Is getting a prescription on day 29 instead of 30 qualify as ""unusually large or frequent"" use? The key word there is ""unusually.""   In my professional opinion, it does not. I fill scripts on day 29 every day. Actually, almost every single script I fill is before the day the patient runs out. You, if course, are entitled to your own professional opinion. But there's no way in hell filling the script on day 29 is going to lead to a fine from the DEA.  And I would still like to know the specific wording of the law that OP would be breaking.   Edit* I read the article incorrectly, the unusually large or frequent orders is actually for the wholesalers selling to the pharmacies,  so the article has even less to do with this specific issue than I originally thought."
TalesFromThePharmacy,37h5t2,PayEmmy,2,Thu May 28 05:13:47 2015 UTC,"The article mentions dispensing as well. Rite Aid was fined for early refills. One day early is probably not going to get you in trouble, but if a prescription says ""must last 30 days"", I wait until 30 days are up. We have a lot of patients on pain contracts, so I don't mess around, but I work with other pharmacists who fill early and that's their prerogative."

TalesFromThePharmacy,3720me,mredria,10,Mon May 25 15:10:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, and that's where it gets messed up. The patient hangs up, calls the Pharmacy and the Pharmacy faxes the doctor. The doctors ask for 24-72 hours to get back to us and often times, they don't get back to us at all, even after multiple faxes to them. Then there are the times the doctor denies the refill because they want to see the patient first.  The Pharmacy then has to phone the patient to inform them. Usually all hell breaks loose and it becomes the Pharmacy's fault that the doctor won't refill the medication yet. It's a matter of ""kill the messenger."" We have no problem faxing the request, but the doctor should be informing the patient that they need to be seen.  Getting back to the 24-72 hours, no matter how many times we tell some patients that this is the doctor's request, we have to deal with multiple calls and bitchy attitudes over the fact that there is a wait for medication. We will give you a 3 day emergency supply of maintenance medications (no controlled meds) if you are out, but there is no guarantee that the doctor will get back to us in time.   It can escalate into a huge problem for both the patient and the Pharmacy in no time."

TalesFromThePharmacy,36kujv,questionnearst,36,Wed May 20 03:10:07 2015 UTC,"I never lie about not having something in stock, but I know that some pharmacists do.  It's really hard to tell someone that you won't fill their script - so some pharmacists try to take the easy way out.  It helps me to have clear cut rules in my mind about what I generally will and won't fill, but I can and do make exceptions when someone makes a compelling case for why they should be exempted from policy.  Our pharmacy generally does not fill CII's from out of state doctors or from in-state doctors who are over 2-3 hours drive away.  If you had come to my pharmacy I would have politely explained this to you and then waited for your response.  If you had given me your reasonable explanation about the move I probably would have filled your script anyways after encouraging you to find a local doctor.  If you had become immediately defensive and started making demands I would have told you to try somewhere else.    As for your second question - unless your doctor puts your diagnosis on the script we will not know the exact reason a med is prescribed.   Since most patients on Vyvanse are being treated for ADD, that is what most pharmacists and technicians will assume you are being treated for.  I'm sorry if anyone has treated you impolitely due to the med you're on.  Unfortunately due to all the rules and regulations we must follow to fill a CII prescription, being presented with one is usually not the favorite part of a pharmacy employee's day.  Some or most of the resentment you sense is probably frustration with the process and has nothing to do with us judging you."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36kujv,meteorflower,17,Wed May 20 03:57:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! This confirms what I'd assumed was happening.   It means a lot that you wouldn't lie about it being in stock because I genuinely began to question my sanity after being turned away so many times, or worse, worried that I'd moved to the one place in the state where my medication just isn't available. That freaked me out most because it took me years with the neurologist to find a med and treatment plan that works for me, and here I thought I'd have to start all over again. The last thing I needed was my disorder affecting my performance at a new job!  Throughout that whole mess, I understood where the hesitance was coming from, so I was never impolite. It's the system and the people who take advantage of it that make life more difficult for people like me (and even more so for pharmacists!). I get that people abuse stimulants and from the pharmacy's perspective, there's no way of truly knowing a customer's intentions. Still, I'm doing everything I can to manage this disorder and live a productive, (fairly) normal life, and my meds are at least 90% of that equation, so I sometimes resent that it can be such a hassle (on both ends)!"
TalesFromThePharmacy,36kujv,aelephant,5,Wed May 20 04:32:15 2015 UTC,"meteorflower's answer is spot on. The reason some pharmacists would tell you they are out of stock is that some patients would throw a shit fit if you just flat out refused to fill their script, getting a manager and filing a complaint, calling corporate, etc. Just a huge nightmare. Out of stock... patient might be upset, but there's no decision being made to argue about, we just don't have it."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36kujv,Temperatia,15,Wed May 20 13:37:23 2015 UTC,"Since pharmacies are run by corporations, they're run by companies that care about their public image. Which means customer service and customer complaints matter. So, you have to turn the customer away in a fashion that doesn't leave them the ability to complain.   Instead of having a serious discussion about your med and why the pharmacist has concerns about the prescription (a lot of customers are too ignorant about their own medications to have such a discussion anyway) you're just turned away by being told it's not in stock. You can't complain or argue about it not being in stock. Either the pharmacy has it or it doesn't.    Also, just curious: is the pharmacist privy to the reason a certain med is being prescribed? Because the few times I've casually referred to them as my 'narcolepsy meds,' I've been treated so much more politely than I'm accustomed to. Or maybe I'm just being paranoid!   No, the diagnosis is usually not written or included on the prescription. It can be, but not often enough that you can count on it being there."

TalesFromThePharmacy,36kujv,s0yj0y,3,Wed May 20 04:42:23 2015 UTC,"In my state the BOP has started looking through CII scripts to see if the Dx is on it. Pharmacies have been getting dinged if there is no ICD-9 code or diagnosis. Think this could be due to the ""for a legitimate medical purpose"" part. Not proof, but evidence of a doctor-patient relationship, is the fact that he or she gave them a real diagnosis and not just ""Back pain""."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36kujv,edmondskt,2,Wed May 20 13:39:35 2015 UTC,"When they said they were out, did they offer to order it? Sometimes we don't have a drug in stock and other times we do. If someone is willing to wait for us to order it, we will have some left over if other customers happen to come in with a prescription for it. If I get regular prescriptions for a certain CII, I will continue to reorder it every time I get below the average fill amount. If the person isn't willing to wait a few days, then I don't bother ordering it and never have it in stock."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36kujv,makingitstar,3,Wed May 20 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"There was one instance where they did offer to order it (with the stipulation that it would arrive in a week). The problem by then was that I'd been going to a few pharmacies each evening post-work (at a new job) in the midst of a hectic move, hoping they'd have them, and I'd already been a few days without my meds. I legally can't drive unmedicated and I often can't manage to take the bus to work without someone accompanying me, so it's not as simple for me as it is for most.   I think there must be an issue with this particular drug in the area because it was like as soon as they saw my prescription (with my former doc's address), they didn't want to hear anything else, and I already hate being ""that Guy"" who causes a scene/won't take ""no"" for an answer. It just sucked because I had so much stress already and was making an awful impression at my new job due to my episodes, and I was basically helpless until I could carve out time and get a ride to a pharmacy near my old doc (2 hours away, with sometimes an hour wait for my script once I arrived, then two hours back).

Either they're not an established pt, the Dr is too far away, the pt lives to far away, or the clinic is sketchy and the Dr is not reputable are the most common reasons why.  People do not like being told we will not full their script, so sometimes we lie. But sometimes we really do not have the drug in stock. My store gets C2s once a week.

TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,inthrees,6,Tue May 19 23:48:24 2015 UTC,"That is so fucking stupid. I'm not a doctor or pharmacist, but I was once prescribed pain medication.  I only took them if I absolutely needed them because I've always been wary of developing drug addictions of any sort. On top of that, I checked with my doctor that I could cut them to see if a smaller dose would work rather than the full large-ish dose I was prescribed - also because of my concerns about drug addiction. It was a relatively low level pain medication prescribed after a gallbladder removal, but I would do the same thing for any of them. I'm predisposed to addiction, with my family history, but I think that anyone who's prescribed pain medication should follow that sort of process. Maybe I'm more self-aware than most patients, but I really hope not.  If people are ending up addicted, realizing it, then not immediately getting help, it's not the doctor or pharmacist's fault. It's their own."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,TwilightTraveler,3,Tue May 19 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"When I got my wisdom teeth out, I did the same thing with my pain pills. I only took them when I absolutely needed them to not be at a level of pain which was unmanageable. I think that it should be doctors' responsibilities to inform people that if they feel no pain or enjoy taking it, they're probably taking too much.  I also think the judges who voted in favor of this decision don't really understand addiction either. My uncle is a recovering alcoholic and whole heartedly believes that addicts are addicts even if they haven't found their substance of choice. If this is true, then doctors and especially pharmacists didn't cause their addiction. The patient did.   As a whole, this country is in sore need of an honest discussion about drugs. There is too much misinformation and ignorance about them."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,NoUrImmature,3,Wed May 20 16:06:40 2015 UTC,"Your uncle's right about addicts/addictions.  Just because of my family history, I know I'm going to end up addicted to something, but I've specifically chosen my addictions(caffeine and sugar) so that I'm not breaking the law, and not going to kill myself, as long as I maintain reasonable doses.  That's why I'm almost paranoid of painkillers(even OTC ones), as well as determinedly avoiding cigarettes, alcohol, and illicit drugs. I figure being self aware about my own addictive tendencies will help make sure I get addicted only to things I allow myself to. I've been informed that this has made me a bit boring, but I'd much rather be boring than addicted to something I didn't chose."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,TwilightTraveler,5,Wed May 20 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"So I know this story sounds like a no-brainer stupid idea, but there are instances where doctors (not pharmacists) do contribute to the opiate addiction problem.  About 10 years ago, I was diagnosed with a form of auto-immune arthritis of the spine.  Yes, it sucks as much as you would imagine.    My first rheumatologist had to wait a year to begin my arthritis medication because it turns out I was positive for TB (not active TB) and had to be treated for that first because the arthritis meds are known to up your chances of getting an active TB infection.  Fast forward two years.  I've been on the arthritis medication for a year and on pain killers for two years.  The arthritis medication was not working well and my pain killer intake was only going up.  My rheumatologist had no problem writing me prescriptions for higher and higher doses.  Luckily for me, I was well versed in the dangers of opiate addiction so I started asking my doctor what else we could do because my treatment plan was not going to be viable for very much longer.  You can't just keep taking higher and higher doses of opiates and expect a positive outcome.  She responded that there was NOTHING else we could do.  I knew this was not true because I was only on the first of several types of arthritis medication.  I dumped her, found a reputable pain clinic and another rheumatologist.  Within a year my arthritis was better and I was tapering off the opiates.  BTW, I have an enormous amount of alcohol and drug addiction in my family.  I also have chronic depression (which can add to addictive behaviors).  If I had not advocated for myself, my only option would have been to continue my first doctor's treatment plan which would not have ended well for me in terms of opiate addiction.  There were days when I could not even get out of bed due to the amount of pain.  Unfortunately, there is no way to call a doctor out on this type of treatment.  Doctors do not self-regulate.  The state barely regulates the worst doctors, much less the mildly incompetent ones.  The only way you get restitution from bad doctors is by being able to sue them.  Unfortunately, the fallout from this is that even good doctors get sued and settle because they have to  in order to stay in business.  Think about it in terms of the over-prescribing of antibiotics and how much trouble that is causing the world in terms of antibiotic resistant bacteria.  Doctors know this.  The government knows this.  Yet, nothing is done about it.  Doctors are not punished for over-prescribing antibiotics.  The only reason the DEA has set its sites on pill-mill doctors is because doctors over-prescribe opiates.  They hurt people who don't need opiates and they hurt people who do.  So, yeah, it sounds stupid for addicts to be able to sue doctors for their addiction, but in some cases, it makes sense."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,awhq,1 point,Wed May 20 15:50:24 2015 UTC,I have read the standard amount of time doctors are taught about addictions related to legitimate pain is about 6 hrs. I have experienced some horrific examples of how doctors just are not educated enough on the dangers of addictions. I swear 15 minutes using google would double some doctors knowledge.
TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,Johjac,9,Fri Jun 5 01:28:15 2015 UTC,"Fucking ridiculous. Just another example of a total lack of personal responsibility. Sure, it's your neighbor pharmacist's fault you are a useless junkie who's pharmacy ad doctor sopping on a regular basis.   We have a patient who fills 720 CII pain killers each month, yes, seriously MDD24. And no, this is not a terminal cancer patent, this is a lively 20 something year old. Now, I do not know his history, but we are all confident he has a serious problem... or sells the pills. Many times we called his MD to verify the script and it is all legit. And in a bright near future we will probably be sued for that. Oh, joy."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,Idiotsandcheapskate,3,Tue May 19 21:18:24 2015 UTC,I would not feel comfortable filling that even if it is a legitimate prescription. Why do you keep filling it?
TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,stir_phriday,3,Tue May 19 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"I wish I knew! Pharmacists say that since the script is legit, goes through insurance (he doesn't pay cash, which would be a red flag), apparently he is not using any other pharmacies, he never tried to fill early and is generally normal acting, adequate and polite, we have no reason to deny the fill. Maybe it's a company policy, I don't know. If I was in charge, I probably wouldn't fill it. The only think I fucking hate when filling this Rx: this particular med comes in blister packs. And the dude requests that pills be dispensed in regular vials. So I spend tons of time popping out 720 tablets. But whatever, I get paid by the hour."
TalesFromThePharmacy,36inld,Idiotsandcheapskate,1 point,Wed May 20 05:00:49 2015 UTC,Pharmacists can deny any legitimate scripts if they feel that it may harm the patient whether it is controlled or not. No company policy can force you to dispense it. It is the job of the pharmacist to not only deny the script you described but also report it to the DEA so they can investigate that prescriber's prescribing patterns.

TalesFromThePharmacy,35gpou,masterofshadows,3,Sun May 10 23:48:48 2015 UTC,that one transfer at a time rule seems so dumb to me. All it does is create headaches.
TalesFromThePharmacy,35gpou,pizy1,7,Mon May 11 05:09:06 2015 UTC,"I agree. We dread advertisements like this. Another ad (radio and TV) that our company runs goes something like this:    Don't know if your medications are covered by Medicare? Call your local chain pharmacist to find out.    Our system has no way to tell if someone's medication is covered. And we get called constantly to asked ""how much"" their medications will be because of the ad."
TalesFromThePharmacy,35gpou,upsidedownbackwards,3,Mon May 11 02:40:21 2015 UTC,"Dear God that's awful. We used to get a lot of those folks even without any corresponding stupid ads, but the numbers have gone down. Probably because we've taken to being curt and saying, ""no, call your insurance yourself.""  And not to turn this into another angry anti-retail thread but, man, they really don't care that it's the employees who bear the inevitable brunt of backlash when these customers find out the truth, do they? ""Well, he came in the pharmacy to get his free stuff, found out it wasn't free, berated the pharmacy staff nonstop for fifteen minutes... but then he bought a candy bar on the way out, so I'd call that a win!"""

TalesFromThePharmacy,35gpou,LAborn_TXraised,14,Sun May 10 19:36:33 2015 UTC,I think they mean you only need a script to get it free. They use a code in the computer that a company gave them like an insurance card that will make the copay 0.. But people can buy them outright.
TalesFromThePharmacy,35gpou,alicesfaultystars,13,Sun May 10 20:00:07 2015 UTC,You don't need a prescription for a meter. You do need a prescription to get one for free.

Also, if he's in that much pain, most oncologists would place a Fentanyl patch rather than increase the Tramadol that high (unless it's a 200 lb Newfoundland or something).   Or, ya know, she's dipping into the dog's meds. If the vet wrote the script specifying 6 per day max, that's a pretty good sign that he/she suspects this as well. I've had clients that were taking their animals' opioid painkillers. It's a tough spot for the vet, because you can't just cut them off like you would if a patient was abusing their own pain medication. You can, however, mix their buprenorphine with beef flavored syrup instead of fruit flavored syrup to mess with them though!"

TalesFromThePharmacy,35bx0u,headintheclouds33,15,Fri May 8 20:54:01 2015 UTC,"Well, I used to work in a pharmacy that closed for lunch from 1:30-2:00 for lunch EVERY SINGLE DAY. It never stopped people from showing up at 1:32 and getting pissed that we were closed for a measly half hour. Explaining that your pharmacist is working a 12 hour day and only gets a 30 minute break for lunch does nothing to pacify an irate asshole of a customer. There is no explaining that we are human beings (not slave labor) and that we do get a lunch break ( as if they would give up part of their lunch to wait on an asshole customer). The best part? Many of the customers that throw the biggest fits about it are regulars that have been told over and over and over that we close at the same time every day for lunch and they still keep coming while we're closed.  They bitch about it every time and act like they had no idea (outraged- how dare we take a lunch break) even though I personally have told them at least a half dozen times that month alone. No, none of them were dementia patients. They are just assholes that want something to bitch about so they come in when we're closed and then throw a stink to management about it. Then management pages the pharmacist or calls them to the office over the irate customer (while they are supposed to be on their lunch) and now my pharmacist isn't even able to take 30 minutes to eat something before we have to open back up. One would think that management would just say "" Hey, they're closed a half hour for lunch. The pharmacist gets a lunch break. The hours are clearly posted."" ...but no, it's all about the dickbag customer that feels they were personally wronged by our normal, clearly posted operating hours. This is exactly how mistakes are made and lawsuits run rampant in a pharmacy setting, 12 hour shifts with less than a half hour lunch that is interrupted by asshole customers that feel entitled to ""celebrity treatment"" and think the whole world revolves around them. It makes me sick."
TalesFromThePharmacy,35bx0u,VioletteIce,8,Sat May 9 15:10:42 2015 UTC,I wish that we closed for lunch breaks our pharmacists work 12 hours usually and don't get a break at all. The techs get one if they have had a 7 hour or longer shift and its a 30min break. If we closed for lunch people would go crazy. Heck people go crazy when we close drive thru 15mins early just so we can get out on time (which usually never happens) even though we have the times posted every where...people have stopped surprising me.
TalesFromThePharmacy,35bx0u,Chobitpersocom,1 point,Sat May 9 17:20:44 2015 UTC,"We aren't allowed to close anything early, nor stay behind to help a patient, and can't refuse to fill a script either.  Makes no fucking sense."

TalesFromThePharmacy,35bx0u,JustZisGuy,5,Sat May 9 17:28:16 2015 UTC,Well yeah maybe crazy is a bit over dramatic but we have had people yell at us and trying to open the gate. It's not that we close early those are the hours of drop off and drive thru. The drop off and drive thru have always closed 15mins before we do inside.

TalesFromThePharmacy,35bx0u,VioletteIce,1 point,Sat May 9 19:03:56 2015 UTC,It surprises me that you fully shut for lunch. The pharmacies I'm familiar with just can't fill prescriptions when the Pharmacist is on lunch. They can still hand out filled prescriptions (as long as it's not a first-time script)... at least I think that's the procedure.
TalesFromThePharmacy,35bx0u,PhallusPhalanges,7,Sat May 9 19:06:48 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about other pharmacies, but I know it's policy that no techs can be in the pharmacy at all if the pharmacist is out on lunch where I work. Everyone has to be out and the pharmacy closed and secured with the alarm. If it isn't our lunch or break time at the same time, we have to stay in the OTC area and zone the shelves during that time. I still don't think it's a lot to ask for regular customers to know the operating hours and/or at least not throw a tantrum when they show up during times the pharmacy is closed when it is clearly posted. That is nobody's fault but their own.  If I go to my Doctor's office at midnight (when they close at 6pm), the doors will be locked and my Dr. won't be there. It's not rocket science."
TalesFromThePharmacy,35bx0u,etchedchampion,2,Sun May 10 04:30:38 2015 UTC,I don't know if this is in every state but in my state nobody can be in the pharmacy unless a pharmacist is on duty.

TalesFromThePharmacy,35bx0u,MsAlign,11,Sun May 10 04:22:21 2015 UTC,"Just yesterday we were 20 minutes from closing. The Pharmacy I've been in lately is kind of hidden away in a courtyard near a major hospital. One of the Techs saw a man with a walker trying to make it down the four steps into the courtyard. (There's a ramp on the other side of the building but not on our side) The Tech went out and he started screaming that it's the Pharmacist's responsibility to help him. So, our new PIC walked out and assisted him down the stairs.   He came in the Pharmacy and informed us that he had prescriptions at another Pharmacy but was unable to get there and wanted us to transfer all of them to us. The Tech asked him which Pharmacy and what location? He knew the name but didn't know which location. Finally figuring it out, they asked for them to RTS what they had ready and transfer them. It turned out there were 9 Rxs.  We informed the patient that we were about to close (and aren't open on the weekends) and asked if Monday was satisfactory? This was really when he started yelling. Not because we were closing or even closed on the weekend, but because 9 Rxs wasn't all that he was expecting and yes, he needed them all NOW. WHAT? He then said that Walgreen's must have the rest of them, but he didn't know which Walgreen's they were at and wanted us to call his doctor. Did I mention he also had 2 written scripts with him?   Thankfully, I had a bus to catch so I was able to leave. I found out later last night that they totally accommodated this guy and finally left for home one hour late. He's so ""happy"" that he's going to use us from now on. Oh joy.   I'm all for bending over backwards to help out a patient, but this guy was rude and condescending to all of us. He figured if we hadn't locked the door yet, then it was our duty to stay as late as needed until he was satisfied."

Call it burn out or whatever but a lot of that ""good service"" entitlement is only checked you remind them that the service isn't mandatory, it's a courtesy. Your job isn't to be super nice Johnny on the spot for them, it's to ensure patient rxs are done quickly, efficiently, precisely and pleasantly.

TalesFromThePharmacy,356zsr,Idiotsandcheapskate,4,Thu May 7 23:24:01 2015 UTC,Oh man. I know that feeling when a customer asks you to call his insurance for him for something he could easily do himself. I would be glad to do it... if there wasn't a line of 20 people all waiting.

Can you not ask for help from the front end (assuming retail drug store)?  I have had times when I had to help drop off/pick up and drive through on my own during a rush hour. The only way I think to be fair is to go one section at a time. One pick up finished, go to drop off, then drive thru, then back to pick up.

It's a first come-first served kind of thing. When I work, it's always me and the pharmacist and if the pharmacist has a line at pickup and there's one person at drop-off, that person is going to wait until everyone who came before him/her is helped. There was no reason to yell at you, but I too would have been pissed if I watched a whole line of people be helped before me for some magical reason that was not apparent to me.   I know that the pharmacist is your boss on duty that day, but ultimately your manager doesn't want a complaint from a customer.  Personally, when I'm working, if the pharmacist says they're going to help someone while I'm helping a line of people and I look over and they haven't done it, I will go over there and help them myself. The pharmacist can bitch and moan about it all he/she wants and can even tell your manager you're insubordinate, but all that matters is good customer service was provided and you would have done that."

You give me ID or you don't get your shit. That's how it works. There are other people waiting on their meds and there is barely enough time to even breathe in the pharmacy as-is.

I think YOU are the one who isn't understanding. It most certainly does matter what tone you use with a customer. A professional tone that lays out the formality of needing to check ID is not rude. It's professional, effective communication.

I mean, sure, there is a chance it could get lost but once it's in a California file and in that cabinet, I've never seen it disappear. It's definitely annoying if we run out of stock on it but the chance of someone not getting their C2 is slim to none.

TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,smd75jr,8,Tue May 5 11:50:30 2015 UTC,What is truly frustrating about this situation is that several of the generic ADHD drugs have been shorted over the past couple of years because of manufacturing issues. I have absolutely no idea if I am going to get what I ordered until the day it comes. I can't tell you what I don't know. I have a few regular patients who get upset if we don't have something but I have no control over it.   Last week I had to get a special override because we exceeded our allowed order amount of generic Estratest HS. Who in goodness sake is out there abusing this to the point they had to make caps on ordering this crap?  I don't know I just work here.
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,Imnotreallytrying,6,Tue May 5 12:31:16 2015 UTC,Exactly. We started to turn down people who weren't our store's customers because we were running out of ADHD meds for our regulars.

The Pharmacist's reason? This woman was not a regular, and while they had the drug in stock, the RPH told her, ""hey, they are cutting us back on this drug and I need to keep it for our regular patients that come here every month"". This patient was not having it-she demanded the RPH fill her prescription, saying it was first come, first serve. The RPH repeatedly asked her where she had been getting her Norcos filled and the woman ignored her and continued on her tirade. The worst part was the people on this woman's Facebook page telling her to sue Rite Aid and insinuating that maybe the RPH was holding the Norcos so she could sell them. I tell people multiple times on a daily basis ""per our owner, we cannot take new patients for pain medications"". Most of the pharmacies in our area are doing the same. I would say that most of the people are understanding, but every once in a while, we get someone who flips out.

I work in a nice area, and I can easily see the rationale behind not telling someone if you have something in stock for burglary reasons, but think about it from his point of view. If I got prescribed hydrocodone and had to go to the store physically every time to find out if they had any in stock, I would go batshit crazy -- ESPECIALLY if it was something they didn't have in stock and I was waiting to have filled. Not only do you have to wait 3-5 business days, you have to PHYSICALLY come in every day and it might not even come. Like I said, I get it, I don't work in a dangerous area, etc etc etc, but I will always check for people. I never tell them ""oh we have 5000 hydrocodone in stock"" - I ask them how many they need and if I have that amount, I will only confirm or deny."

TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,Willbabe,14,Tue May 5 08:29:56 2015 UTC,"it sounds like a store-level or rxmanager thing - they probably had a patient drop off a C2 script to be filled on X day, and lost the hardcopy in the interim. it caused a huge ordeal or something, corporate complaints, etc. and the manager decided they weren't going to hold on to anyone's C2 scripts anymore, now they're putting some responsibility on the patient to bring it in when they are due for the fill."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,Brext,10,Tue May 5 09:15:32 2015 UTC,"Is that against regulations? Because I have never had trouble dropping off prescriptions before they are due.   I've floated at a few stores with that policy. With my company, especially lately, corporate has had a bad habit of putting ordering caps on stores C-2s. I've seen issues where we may have scripts holding for 2-3 patients for an adderall or a dilaudid and only get enough to fill one. You think a patient is mad when you don't have their C-2? Wait until you see them wait a week for one and we still don't have it. I've always told them we can order it for X date but we cannot guarantee it will come in, so we recommend they keep their RX because I know how important that drug is for them, and that way they can keep looking for it if need be."

TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,msb4464,9,Tue May 5 18:22:07 2015 UTC,"You've gotten some good replies, but people are forgetting that post dated c2s are not allowed under federal law.  So if your doctor gives you a prescription to fill in a month, and you bring it on to the pharmacy a few days early, the letter of the law says we are supposed to refuse it. Some pharmacies will hold onto then for a few days then fill it, because the law is stupid and only applies to c2 meds.  Other ones can be put on hold and filmed when eligible."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fattunesy,3,Tue May 5 12:53:50 2015 UTC,"Doesn't have to be post dated to be too soon. Could be an insurance thing, or just a day supply thing even when paying cash."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,Brext,3,Tue May 5 13:47:32 2015 UTC,"True, but it is explicitly against the controlled substances act to write a prescription with a date in the future.  Today is the fifth, a script dated for the tenth is not allowed and if I am remembering this right (it has been a while) is supposed to be confiscated and destroyed.  Waiting to fill a script that is too soon to fill is different, as long as it is after the date on the script it is legal."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fattunesy,2,Tue May 5 13:53:06 2015 UTC,"True, but it is explicitly against the controlled substances act to write a prescription with a date in the future.

TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,hillerj,1 point,Tue May 5 19:02:47 2015 UTC,"Per the current federal rules, scripts totaling 90 days of needs can be given at once.  That could be 9 each for ten days, or 3 scripts for 30, 1 script of 90 days or some variation.  What they are allowed to do is influenced by the states rules.  Making things even less clear, some states have more stringent requirements, and the rule is the most stringent requirement is the one followed.  The rule is against writing in the future beyond that time window it is technically not allowed. Pharmacy plays a sort of don't ask don't tell type thing where as long as we don't know it was originally post dated we don't care."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fattunesy,1 point,Tue May 5 19:10:52 2015 UTC,"It's not against the rules to write it. My pharmacy gets prescriptions that are future-dated all of the time. We can't fill them before that date, but we can definitely put them on file until then."

TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,Brext,2,Tue May 5 18:20:22 2015 UTC,"If the date on the prescription has already past that is fine.  It is only a problem if the date on the script is in the future.  That said, even with those pharmacies may bend the law to accommodate regulars.  It is one of those laws which don't make a ton of sense.  Edit:  If the script is in date there is no problem legally with the pharmacy holding the script until it can be filled."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fattunesy,1 point,Tue May 5 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"Please clarify something for me. What is the date on the prescription? Let me clarify my question. I see a doctor Jan 1, get a script for a 30 day, take it to my nice neighborhood pharmacy. They have the stuff, fill the prescription, and give it to me. Insurance pays. All on Jan 1. Now I go back to my doctor on Jan 15, get a new script. The date is obviously not Jan 15. Jan 31 is the insurance renewal date. Is that the implied date for the script as well because it was a 30 day supply? I assume so but never really thought about this. Ignoring insurance is the doctor allowed to give a script for Jan 20? Or having given a 30 day supply that is it?"
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,Brext,3,Tue May 5 18:35:30 2015 UTC,"By date I literally mean the date the doctor writes at the top of the script. If he writes January 15th at the top it is fine.  Even if he also writes not to fill until the 30th on it. The problem is when the script you pick up has the date written as the 30th and you bring it in on the 28th.  Prescriptions are legally required to have a ""date written"" on them.  By law, it cannot be a date in the future.  All of this is totally separate from when your insurance will pay for the prescription.  It could be legally valid, but the insurance won't pay for it until the thirty days is up.  You could still theoretically pay the full price and get the medication.  It gets a bit more complicated than that, but as a general rule what I said is true."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fattunesy,2,Tue May 5 18:53:08 2015 UTC,"I've never actually looked at that. I assumed they wrote the date they gave it, but I can see why it would be otherwise. So in theory a doctor can write three scripts dated Jan 1, Feb 1, and Mar 1. (Months should really have 30 days each. Someone needs to change some orbits.) Since the scripts are only good for 30 days I can fill one a month. OK.   Thanks, that makes sense."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,jilliu5,2,Tue May 5 19:01:19 2015 UTC,"That is an extremely common practice, especially for things like adhd meds.  A new script is needed every month (in some States), but each script is only good for thirty days and can't have refills, so instead of making the patient come in every month the doctor writes a handful of scripts. Each one dated for the first of the month as you mention.  That is technicallyally a violation of the controlled substances act, but it is one that pharmacies don't want to enforce.  As it just makes it harder on everyone."

I can't tell you how often I've had pharmacists cop an attitude with me or they're the ones screwing things up and try to blame it on the patient or the provider.    Just yesterday; we had a pharmacist call claiming a discharged patient of ours brought in a prescription. It ended up being a prescription from last year that the patient did not bring in that day but it was found by a pharmacist and they went to go fill it despite having already filled it last year AND it was on the patient's kasper report.    Needless to say, they were rude as hell to us thinking we were writing fraudulent prescriptions when it was just their inability to use half their brain. There have been plenty of times the pharmacy claims they can't take ""pre-printed"" prescriptions because it's against state law despite our direct conversation with the OIG who said as long as the signature is not stamped or pre-printed, it's legal.

We invited the DEA, OIG and state into our clinic. Files open completely and were told by the DEA we had the cleanest and most organized records and system they'd seen of any clinic in the state.    We are small, we don't have anywhere near our ""limit"" on patients because we kick patients out almost immediately in response to suspected diversion. We don't sit people down for all of 10 minutes and hand out prescriptions. We are usually here 12+ hours every Saturday seeing patients. We have 2 24 hour emergency relapse prevention lines patients can call or text any time. We do above and beyond what state regulations require and in fact, our attorney helped shape many of the recent regulations put into place.    We personally speak to pharmacists if / when we call in prescriptions and we have only 1 person in the entire office do them. That way they aren't speaking to someone different every time and they get to know the person so it at least makes it somewhat less ""shady"".    We know pharmacists hate Suboxone but that doesn't mean you get a free pass to be dickheads to us or our patients. My contact with pharmacies is primarily in regards to insurance and I can't tell you how many times they've gotten attitude with me because they run the prescription for tablets when, for example, Humana Medicaid in this state only covers films. They act like they don't have a clue what I'm talking about, they say ""You just need to submit the PA and they'll approve tablets""....No, that's not how this works. How do you work at a pharmacy and not know this stuff? So then they tell the patient ""Your doctor needs to do their job and submit a PA"" (Yes, they've actually said this and I've heard it over the phone). Patient calls me complaining about a PA. I tell the patient it's approved for Films, Pharmacy runs it incorrectly and tells me I need to call the insurance. I call the insurance, they tell me pharmacy is running it incorrectly and I need to call the pharmacy and have them call the pharmacy help desk. I call the pharmacy and they get an attitude because I'm telling them what the insurance told me.    It's this constant dance that wastes hours of my week all because the pharmacist doesn't know what they're doing and for some reason (despite filling tons of suboxone prescriptions every week) doesn't know that Humana Medicaid covers films and Anthem medicaid covers tablets.    Why get an attitude about it with me? We all deal with our fair amount of shit, there's no need to be a dickwad to a providers office about things.

I'm sorry for all the assholes giving the good ones a bad name... although I'm sure we're few and far between."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,jmwjmwjmw,11,Tue May 5 14:33:22 2015 UTC,"I was stereotyping. I apologize.  I know there are people in recovery doing the deal.  12 step, support group, Suboxone if needed, etc. All I can relate to people taking Suboxone is my experience while they are in the hospital.  The overwhelming majority of them are demanding, manipulative, and use drug seeking behavior.  The younger the patient the worse they are.  Nurses dread taking care of them.    They try to get MD to write for ""something stronger"".  These people are coming in with cellulitis or colitis and various other non- painful conditions. If they were in acute pain, that's different.  Its hard when you deal with crap like that, you do become cynical.  The good ones like you are collateral damage, unfortunately.  Just like when Mr. Suboxone Clinic said 95% of pharmacists are dumb arrogant assholes.  Some of us are. No doubt.  Not the majority."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,gatorhound,5,Tue May 5 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately there's more people in addiction than recovering from it, or it sure seems that way. I read these stories and see them play out in person and can't imagine going through what pharmacists do for 40-60 (I imagine) hours a week. I've definitely come across a few jerks who were blatantly disrespectful. But usually it's just the look of ""is this girl going to cause issues "" and I try to smile and be extra kind and patient. Thank you for your thoughtful response."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fattunesy,8,Tue May 5 15:11:26 2015 UTC,"I can imagine it must be hard.  But don't worry about what they think.  Fuck 'em.  Whether its the pharmacist, an old boyfriend, chick at Wal-Mart, all long as you okay with you, you won't give a shit what others think of you.  I had a neighbor who was a therapist tell me one night when I was in a bad place....""gatorhound...what other people think of you is none of your business, whether its good, bad, or indifferent""  It took me awhile and I finally figured out what he meant."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fuzio,6,Tue May 5 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"CMMS had denied payment for pre printed prescriptions. I have personally been part of an audit where significant chargeback occurs due to denied payment after the fill. So, yes, they can legally be filled, but no, they do not have to be paid for. So in this case it is you that is fucking wrong.  Edit:  this isn't just controled medications either. It was once common practice for bowl prep meds to be ordered on pre printed forms at my hospital.  After our outpatient pharmacy got revenue clawed back for all of them that were paid for by Part D we had to change practice."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,msb4464,-11,Tue May 5 12:37:59 2015 UTC,"So in this case it is you that is fucking wrong.   I'm talking solely about the pharmacist, not insurance. Insurance PA'd it and paid for the medication. It was solely the pharmacy refusing to accept it and stating (and I quote) ""Pre-printed prescriptions are against state regulations"" which is a lie.    So sorry, but no it is not me that is ""fucking wrong""."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fuzio,9,Tue May 5 13:45:22 2015 UTC,"CMMS at the state level (Medicaid) could be enforcing it via lack of payment. A pharmacy can't just give away stuff anymore than any other business. If you went to target and made off with all their toilet paper based on an IOU that ended up not paying out, they'd stop accepting those too.  No pharmacist ever has personally wanted a hand written prescription. They're impossible to read and often wrong or missing information.   This doesn't make your pharmacist an asshole. I'm sure that they were quite pleasant the first, second, third, fourth time they explained it to you. But if they have to KEEP calling while patients are yelling at them for not filling their ""subs"" it is going to get frustrating.   You need to try to see it from more than one person's perspective. I'm sure it is annoying for you to have to write prescriptions rather than just print them out and sign. But when you're in health care you need to balance a minor inconvenience for you and getting the right care for your patients."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,Megmca,-7,Tue May 5 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"I should probably clarify, it's only been one single pharmacy that has claimed it's ""against state regulations"" to use stamped prescriptions. (Which again, is not true)    It was just one example. It's not an issue we have all the time."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fuzio,7,Tue May 5 14:08:58 2015 UTC,So it's just the one pharmacy then?  Not 95% of them.
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,Megmca,-2,Tue May 5 18:03:43 2015 UTC,That was just a single comment about one particular pharmacy.
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fuzio,7,Tue May 5 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"Because you seriously sound like one of our regular problem offices.  Said office regularly sends us prescriptions for diabetic supplies for Medicare patients.  In order to bill these prescriptions they must have the diagnosis code written on the prescription.  In spite of us calling them multiple times a week for each patient they never put the diagnosis code on the prescription.  This is not something we require, it is something Medicaid requires.  The office gets mad at us for both calling them to fix the problem and for not just writing the diagnosis code on there ourselves and filling it (which would be against the law).  The patient gets mad at us because we have to wait for the office.    If an auditor comes in and sees that we are filling prescriptions without having the diagnosis code or if we are the ones writing it on the hard copy we will get fined.  Not the doctor's office.    So that one pharmacy won't take pre-printed prescriptions.  Tell your patients not to go there.  Other pharmacies giving you a headache?  Call them in the morning, maybe around eleven am or sometime when they aren't busy, and ask them how you can help streamline the process.  I guarantee you the pharmacists and technicians don't want to have problems with your prescriptions.    We just want this shit to go through.  We can't substitute tablets for films if one is covered by the insurance and the other isn't.  We have to fill what is written on the prescription or call for permission to substitute.  If a doctor writes Proair when he means Albuterol 90mcg inhaler I can't substitute Ventolin or Proventil just because the insurance will only pay for Ventolin or Proventil.  I have to fill what the doctor ordered.  Without knowing the specific reasons you are having problems with so many pharmacies it is hard to give advice beyond trying to prevent issues from cropping up before they happen.  I promise you the only reason pharmacists are assholes is that the law sometimes requires it."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,amileandahalf,-3,Tue May 5 18:46:19 2015 UTC,"Tell your patients not to go there     We did. Considering it's the only pharmacy in that small town, it's a major inconvenience for many of our patients. I was merely quoting a story in which a head pharmacist was being a dick and claiming things were laws when they weren't.     We can't substitute tablets for films if one is covered by the insurance and the other isn't.     I understand that, I also understand if one is circled (i.e. Films) but the insurance covers the other (i.e. Tabs) then a new prescription has to be given if any has been filled under the old prescription.    The issues I tend to have are pharmacies telling me I haven't done my job, when I have. They tell me ""Well you need to call the insurance"" when I try to tell them that they are running it incorrectly and that THEY need to call the pharmacy help desk. They don't believe me because ""huehuehue you work for a provider, u dont know anything"". So I then waste 30 minutes of my time speaking to the insurance company only to be told ""Yes, you are correct. The pharmacy is not running it correctly. They need to call the pharmacy help desk"". So then I have to call the pharmacy back, tell them again that the insurance has said they are running it incorrectly and to call the pharmacy help desk.    I understand they want things to go through smooth just as much as we and the patient's do. I get that but often times (and this I admit I don't know how this works) the patient has Medicaid, the doctor didn't circle Film or Tab. The patient says ""I want films"" despite their insurance covering tablets. What I don't understand is; do the pharmacists not understand (despite filling many of these prescriptions under medicaid) that certain medicaid plans covers films and others cover tablets? Shouldn't they say ""Well your insurance covers the tablets. Are you sure you want films?""    I mean, I had this insurance job thrown in my lap suddenly without any prior insurance experience and I feel like I know more about this than pharmacists I talk to on the phone do. Many of them act like ""Oh I didn't know Humana only covered films"" and I'm just like....... don't you fill these things every single day? How do you not know?    Feel free to enlighten me because maybe it's something I don't see or understand but it's extremely frustrating for me."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fattunesy,10,Tue May 5 19:05:37 2015 UTC,"the doctor didn't circle Film or Tab   That is an invalid prescription. The patient/pharmacy can't decide what the doctor wanted to order.   Oh I didn't know Humana only covered films"" and I'm just like....... don't you fill these things every single day? How do you not know?   At my pharmacy we fill Suboxone once or twice a month. There are hundreds of insurance plans and thousands of drugs. It's impossible for the pharmacy to know the formulary on all of them. Since your clinic specializes in this one drug you DO know what is or is not covered. Why don't your doctors prescribe the correct film or tablet based on the patient's insurance? You already know exactly which one will pay."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34x1t3,fuzio,6,Tue May 5 19:37:21 2015 UTC,"Good good you're an idiot with no concept of how pharmacy works.  The insurance can pay for the medication. Even with a PA, but then they come in at a later date, sometimes six months later, to audit.  They review the paper copy of the actual prescription and see it is pre-printed, then issue a charge back for the medication, taking back the payment by reducing future payments. Furthermore, they apply it as a percentage. So let's say they audit ten scripts and five have issues. They may reduce payment by fifty percent for a period of time. Specific penalties depend on the contract with the pharmacy and the pbm.  Again, a PA has nothing to do with how the prescription is generated, it is only for the medication."

TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,mejy,11,Sun May 3 23:36:53 2015 UTC,"Ugh, but when doctor's don't even take the time to read the coupon. It will say, in big bright letters ""Save Up To $75 On Each Monthly Prescription!"" but then the patient will start screaming that we're ripping them off because the doctor said that it would only be $75 after the coupon.   Though, that's not the coupon's fault. Doctors offices still do stupid stuff like hear about Target's $4, but then tell every patient that a certain drug is $4 no matter where they get it.   If they weren't yelling at us about coupons they'd just be yelling about something else. Customer service has really made me lose my faith in humanity.

I hate doctors who give them to patients on Medicare and Medicaid and tell them the coupon will still work if they just run it through without insurance.  It will but it will likely end up costing more than with insurance.   I hate the drug companies that don't put a pcn on the card so we have to guess which one it runs under.   I hate the patients who give them to us at checkout and expect it to work like an over the counter coupon for shake and bake.

Usually if somebody isn't eligible to use it or doesn't understand the savings limits, I just read them the fine print and they are fine with it. I've saved somebody over $400 in a transaction with coupons. It took me ten extra minutes but that is worth it to me to help somebody.

I like this patient so it's 10 minutes of my day well spent."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,hillerj,10,Mon May 4 04:58:17 2015 UTC,"Yes.

Then the customers get grumpy because it's taking longer than they'd like and get bitchy at us.   Also, like you said, I HATE that the doctors will often give them out to patients who can't use them."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,hillerj,10,Mon May 4 00:08:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, and then there are the customers who bring their coupons in without activating them even though it says in bold words to activate before using.

TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,chirpity,1 point,Mon May 4 02:12:25 2015 UTC,"That's because coupons in most circumstances are used when being rung up. If the pharmacy is different from the vast majority of other places that accept coupons, and if they're being used more often than before (as indicated here), maybe a sign would help. It doesn't sound like the consumer can really be blamed for that one... Nowhere else does a coupon take 10 minutes to process either. Sounds like the pharmacy is completely different than every other system I've ever heard of or used with regard to coupons."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,ZennerThanYou,8,Mon May 4 04:00:47 2015 UTC,Grocery stores don't have to process and run your bananas through insurance either.  I always ask if they have any coupons on items that I know commonly have them but still run into the problems above.  When a customers gives the coupon to us as we are ringing them up we actually have to start completely over in the system.
TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,Temperatia,2,Mon May 4 04:06:26 2015 UTC,"I guess I just don't know how a customer could possibly know this in advance. It goes back to what I was saying about pharmacies handling coupons completely differently from the rest of the coupon-accepting world, regardless of the reason. I don't doubt it's super frustrating, but I understand the frustration on both sides. Customers hate waiting as much as pharmacies hate starting the transaction over, I assume.   Personally, I wouldn't mind waiting an extra few minutes, especially for worthwhile savings. I only ever start getting annoyed when I'm told it'll be a 2 hour wait, come back 2:15 later & am told it'll be another 15 minutes, come back again & have to wait another 10 minutes. I've learned to just check the damn app (lol)."
TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,Temperatia,8,Mon May 4 04:16:36 2015 UTC,"All coupons tell the patient to present them along with their prescription.

TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,mckinnon3048,3,Mon May 4 04:35:18 2015 UTC,"I just pulled 3 prescription savings cards out of my boyfriend's wallet. Only one said to present it with the prescription.   Prescription savings or coupon cards? The general discount cards might not have it, but a coupon card for a specific drug usually has directions for patients and for the pharmacy.   If they don't then the card itself would have come stuck to a pamphlet that describes how to use it. I can't think of a discount card that doesn't come with directions.  Pharmacy technicians are the subject of each other's stories. So, yeah. I do try to keep in mind how to actually fix a problem so I can understand if the person presenting this problem made a silly mistake or is just stupid, because that changes how slowly I have to talk if I explain the answer to them.   Like, when you tell someone their prescription is too soon to be filled and they just stare at you and say ""What does that mean?"" It means exactly what the fuck I just said."

TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,sfvalet,6,Tue May 5 00:20:43 2015 UTC,"Nah, don't feel bad. I encourage coupon use especially if it will help with adherence and it's not like I actively discourage people from getting their medications (I do not set the prices and I cannot predict how the insurance will cover the medication). For example, we have HIV patients who take antivirals and the coupon knocks it down to like $0 co-pay. This is good because I know this patient will continue to take his antivirals as long as his copay is low. I do try to find ways for the patient to get their medications.   It's not really a pain for the system I use since I can connect the coupon I enter to the drug it's supposed to cover. It's only the first time setting it up. Sometimes I'll run into a patient who doesn't know that they can't use the coupon for whatever reason and think I had something to do with it or they fail to activate the coupon (which does require the patient to activate since it asks a bunch of personal questions)."

TalesFromThePharmacy,34rmor,redcurls91,1 point,Mon May 4 14:24:43 2015 UTC,"The two worst scenarios: 1) people who say 'it should be on file' and then you look and they have 8,000 different coupons with the same BIN number and generic 'Therapy First' name, and 2) people with coupons for C-IIs (looking at you, Vyvanse) who don't, when dropping off, either present the coupon or mention one being on file, then come back to pick it up and get mad that it wasn't run under the coupon. I think this is why coupons are so frustrating. To me, a successful adjudication is one that goes through insurance and is covered. If I see that, I'm happy and I move on to the next thing. With coupons, suddenly that attitude is wrong; suddenly I'm apparently supposed to be checking to make sure every new prescription goes under the same COB as before. When you're doing hundreds of prescriptions a day, that is really not feasible.  As an aside, though, I really thought this thread was going to be about store coupons. Yesterday was that time of year with everyone bringing in those obnoxious ""25% off"" mailers and buying everything in the store. But of course no one's 25% off mailer matched up to their rewards card so I had to stand there with a calculator squinting at the screen trying to figure out what 25% off their non-sale non-prescription items would be..."

This lady didn't want to believe me, cuz her Dr said it would be $4. Maybe, but you are ineligible. The sad part was she didn't know her aarp was part d.

An example would be Maria Soledad Consulela Fernandez de la Rosa.   In her situation, the saint's name was Maria and it was never used by anyone because literally everyone had Maria as a first name. There was a semi-standard abbreviation for Maria that she tacked onto her papers which she headed with her preferred unique name. She never learned to respond to Maria since it wasn't her name but her saint's name. She hated it because it meant that her ""legal"" names weren't the names she had grown up being called."

I've been a tech for about 10 years and worked in (the same) pharmacy for longer. This has always been a thing for as long as I've been there.

I think the reasoning here is that they want to see the request come from the pharmacy that includes things on the label like last fill date, written date, number of times filled (which will tell them how compliant the patient is or is not) and soforth. There's a lot of stuff on the refill request that probably isn't on the bottle label.

These students know nothing about drugs or the disease state I'm involved in.

TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,pharmprophet,3,Mon Apr 27 20:49:13 2015 UTC,"Because in many cases what the prescriber wants is very expensive and not that much better than a cheaper option, and often instituting a PA is successful in getting the patient on an alternative medication that works just as well and is cheaper, thereby keeping everyone's healthcare costs a little lower.   If a doctor writes for some new brand-name medication, the insurance company wants to know why you didn't try the cheaper generically-available medication that costs $30 a month instead of $1,300 — and a lot of times, the insurance company is absolutely correct in questioning it."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,krudler5,2,Sat May 2 22:42:49 2015 UTC,"Good point.  I had a friend who was on Epival (divalproex sodium). Although her insurance was through a provincial government program for low income people and it only covered the generic version, her psychiatrist was able to get approval for the insurance to pay for the brand name version.  According to her, there was some difference between the generic and brand name versions (perhaps some kind of filler or binding agent?), and she couldn't tolerate the generic (I think she said it caused her to have indigestion or some kind of stomach problem).  Is that even possible? Is it common? I assume the generic is suitable for the vast majority of patients."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,pharmprophet,5,Sat May 2 23:31:42 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but it's generally rare. This is why insurance doesn't flat-out reject it, but also doesn't allow it to be prescribed willy-nilly without forcing you to just through some hoops.  Also, it's important to point out here that at no point is the insurance saying you cannot have it. They're saying they will not pay for it until they hear a good reason why they should. You are free to pay cash for it under your doctor's prescription."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,thelittleblueones,13,Sun May 3 00:37:51 2015 UTC,"According to a patient I spoke with last week, it's also the pharmacy's responsibility to call the patient to let them know there are no refills. Never mind how it's printed on the effing bottle."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,MsAlign,12,Sat Apr 25 23:44:26 2015 UTC,"Every weekend:  ""You've got no refills on this.  We'll send it to the dr's office.  Check back with us on Monday.""  ""But why didn't I get a call to tell me there was no refills!?!""  ""It's printed on the medication label.""  ""Well you need to give me some!""  No, I don't need to give you any.  It's a courtesy.   And it seems like the ones in a panic in the middle of the night on a weekend either have a control,  an inhaler,  or birth control.   ""No, I'm sorry, but I can't give you part of a Nuvaring."""

TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,DarthLurtz,11,Sun Apr 26 02:03:34 2015 UTC,"All the doctors in our area have a line on their answering service to contact the pharmacy when requesting refills.  Also we've run into a situation several times now where a patient is moving to retail from mail-order, needs a new prescription because the mail-order one has expired or run out, and the doctor won't write a new one without us sending a request for a refill on a script we've never filled."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,delkana,11,Sat Apr 25 18:40:25 2015 UTC,I think some of the problem is that the record-keeping at some of these physician offices is so poor they aren't actually sure what the patient is still taking.  Getting a faxed refill request from the pharmacy and not a verbal patient request is the only way to be sure the medication is something the patient actually has on file.
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,DarthLurtz,9,Sat Apr 25 19:55:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I've been figuring. For some reason pharmacies are the only medical service capable of keeping these records apparently."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,fattunesy,6,Sat Apr 25 20:00:26 2015 UTC,"Not too tough to imagine. Physician sees patient in the hospital for a new condition.  E prescribes something using the hospital computer system. That computer system doesn't connect to his office system. So no record of the prescription in his files, other than notes he makes on the office charts, which realistically no one has time to do considering they will be updated at a follow up appointment.  But the pharmacy has the info, and will send it with a refill request."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,krudler5,2,Sun Apr 26 02:48:53 2015 UTC,"Does the hospital not send the doctor a discharge summary? The hospital in my city usually does. For example, if I go to the ER, they ask who my family doctor is and whether it's OK to send them a copy of the report. If I'm admitted, they send (fax?) my family doctor a report when I'm discharged. And, I go to see a clinic at the hospital periodically, and after the specialist has dictated his report on the appointment for my chart and it is transcribed, the clinic usually faxes a copy to my family doctor. I doubt he reads every single non-emergency report they send him, but when I go to see my family doctor, I can always see the latest report in his e-records system."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,fattunesy,3,Mon Apr 27 19:53:12 2015 UTC,"Doesn't always happen.  The ERs tried sending that to the primary docs, but it was too much paper on the fax machines.  The hospitals also have to send it to the right office.  Theoretically it should always happen, and theoretically hospitals are moving towards sending these records electronically via standardized data fields, but my point is that it could easily slip through the cracks.  Or what if it is a specialist?  The primary may have gotten the full records, but the patient is following up with the cardiologist who doesn't receive the discharge report."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,FilipinoPhil,10,Mon Apr 27 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"MD offices (maybe not the doctors, more like the MAs) will do anything to shirk responsibility. I spend much of my day scheduling Prolia, Vivitrol, and Procrit deliveries to MD offices, which should normally entail sending back a form that we fax over.   90% of the time they'll forget to send it back, and then get all angry when I call, asking why we can't just send it.   Sorry, I'm not gonna send out a $1000 med without at least some assurance someone is going to be there to sign for it and that the patient still needs the med in the first place."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,TrystFox,3,Sat Apr 25 18:39:25 2015 UTC,"Ugh...   MAs. Yeah, my last rotation in pharmacy school was at an Amb care clinic, and the MAs were... Not bad, just not cognizant of what the hell actually needed to happen.   As an example, they'd hand me a list of meds and ask me to ""go over them"" with the patient while they input their vials. Okay, so I ask the patient about each med, are they still taking it, how often do you take this or that one, what questions do you have, anything over the counter, vitamins/minerals, any new meds, anything I didn't ask about, and what pharmacy do you get everything from. Then call the pharmacy and verify new meds and anything the patient said that was different from what I had.   The MAs told me that they don't actually do that, it's just ""are you still taking X drug,"" all the way down...     As far as I know, they're still not sufficiently taking med histories there."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,Megmca,9,Sun Apr 26 17:11:17 2015 UTC,"They don't do e-scripts which means them getting the e-fax, which is our system default, is like a 50% chance they'll get the request.  So we'd have to fax then manually and then there's no record in the system that we sent the request.   Ugh."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,TrystFox,2,Sat Apr 25 18:19:23 2015 UTC,"Is there a place for patient notes? ""Request manually faxed by [initials] to [physician office] at [time] on [date]."""
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,Megmca,3,Sun Apr 26 17:13:21 2015 UTC,"Including me there are ten techs in my pharmacy.  Four of them have been there longer than I have.  We're still trying to get the new ones to take their lunches at the right times, and put the prescriptions away in the right bins.   Yes we can put notes in a patient's file but half the techs can't be relied upon to do it at all, much less correctly, and it takes a pharmacist to remove the notes.  We have notes about loaned pills from 2012 that haven't been removed."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,fostertherabbits,4,Sun Apr 26 18:56:30 2015 UTC,"I love calling doctors' offices and hearing ""call your pharmacy and have them fax us a refill request.""

Fantastic system they've got there."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,chirpity,3,Mon Apr 27 00:44:32 2015 UTC,This drives me crazy!  Especially when a patient has the bottle there with them and is still told to have the pharmacy fax them.  Did they need a fax to tell them what to prescribe in the first place too?
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,TK_Finch,4,Sun Apr 26 05:10:23 2015 UTC,"It never hurts.  When I think a doctor had made a poor choice for a patient, I write up what I think they should have prescribed and fax it over.  I have it back signed within 24 hours more than half of the time."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33u757,krudler5,4,Sun Apr 26 14:29:05 2015 UTC,"I wish pharmacists had the ability to prescribe medication, but that's another story. I had one refill left on a prescription that I've been prescribed for a few years (Urocit-K), and per the ""policy"" no written prescriptions will be provided at Dr. visits anymore.

I always check the script to make sure everything is right (she's also accidentally written it for half the mg it was supposed to be and for similar but not the same meds that I've never been on). But sometimes I can't pick it up and I send my boyfriend. He missed that she hadn't signed it until he dropped it at the pharmacy for me. He rushed back across town to the office and managed to get there in time for her to sign it.  Awhile later, I was picking up the script from my doctor and inspected it before I signed for it. I apologized to the waiting nurse and told her it was written for the wrong quantity. She kinda laughed and said ""She does this sometimes and things get missed.

TalesFromThePharmacy,33q2b1,adrenal_out,3,Fri Apr 24 17:05:11 2015 UTC,"Jesus! I have never even heard of the McGill scale. I am a double below the knee amputee, with 2 fingers amputated as well. I have severe nerve damage down my left side, a little bit of phantom pain, 2 lumbar herniations, migraines and chronic bursitis in one of my knees. No wonder I have a bad time. I didn't even know there was a scale to compare types of pain. All I have been on for 13 years is 50 mg of tramadol TID and an occasional (like maybe 1-2 times a week) vicodin. I thought I was just a wimp or something."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33q2b1,Temperatia,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:24:47 2015 UTC,"There is a large range of amputation pain. Some continue to feel the missing limb, some have nothing. Go to /r/chronicpain. There is no clear cure for chronic pain but there are a variety of treatments that might help. This is the art side of medicine, you don't want to be on the art side. You want to be on the engineering side."
TalesFromThePharmacy,33q2b1,anaelle13,2,Fri Apr 24 17:39:16 2015 UTC,"Obviously I am aware that there are ranges of amputation pain. I have had multiple amputations (2 fingers, first all of my toes and bottoms of my feet, then the rest of my feet progressively higher until Bka was the best option, then 2 bilateral revisions after that). I just wasn't aware that there was a scale that could put types of pain into a relative perspective. My pain perception is not exactly normal. I had areas of necrosis at all of my major joints, and then the feet and fingertips that I was medicated for in the hospital after surviving a severe infection. When I got to the trauma center for surgery, the pain specialists told my family I had been ""grossly undermedicated."" I then had debridement surgeries and grafts stapeled all over me for 2.5 mos, as well as several varying levels of amputation and some fascial flap surgeries to cover exposed nerves.   My perception of pain is, like I said, not normal... and I have experienced the full gamut of bone, surgical, superficial (tissue), and nerve pain. Due to that, it is difficult for me to objectively assess my own pain. I do what I can to mechanically ease my pain, like PT and making sure my legs fit properly but the older I get, the more pharmaceutical options are something I am exploring as treatments. My phantom pains are easily for the most part taken care of by gabapentin and I am still not maxxed out on the dose so I am good on that front. My other nerve damage, though, and worsening peripheral neuropathy have become more and more bothersome. I also have a somewhat annoying injury to one of my SI joints that causes me some trouble on the same side of the knee that hates me.   It is just interesting to see how pain is ""ranked"" on a scale... I never know. Probably since the very first time I was ever treated for pain, it was not in a good situation. I was at a small community hospital with no experience with my level of tissue/bone damage and I was given boluses of morphine every 4 hrs. I had no idea how much pain I was supposed to feel or not and I felt guilty asking for more medicine, so I didn't. By the 3rd hour, I would have a fever and my bp would skyrocket and that was their only indication I needed more meds. Looking back, it was pretty brutal.   Sorry for the novel, I just find pain perception and management very interesting. Oh and as far as the technology side of it, I am not a candidate for most devices because they are invasive and I am immunecompromised with organ failure. Medicine, PT and biofeedback types of therapies are my only options right now."

So, they truly were out of it because they never could have had it to begin with.   The second pharmacy just didn't want you to ask them to try to order it. If they didn't already have it on hand, then ordering a drug they never really sell is just not a good purchase for them. Either that or you did something to make them think the script was bad. They may have concluded it was fake because it was written for a strength that doesn't exist. In any case, that's your doctor's fault.  The third pharmacy is probably the only one that happened to notice the problem with the script.   Don't you have a regular pharmacy you go to? Maybe just go there instead of taking a script all over town then bitching at the pharmacy about how the doctor messed up.

Maybe inventory is right around the corner and head office has been putting pressure on them to lower their inventory, so why would they want to order in a product for a patient that may not even become a regular?  None of this is your fault, of course.  Again, it's the nature of the beast and it's sucks that innocent (and even not so innocent people) get caught in the middle.

It's true that mistakes happen from time to time but this is why pharmacist have to independently check our work. Working slowly in the labeling and assembly stage of the process puts added pressure on the checking pharmacist, as does working inaccurately.

They are the basic price of the drugs that are paid by the NHS to the pharmacy to reimburse the pharmacy for the stock. This is also how much pharmacies pay for the drugs from the wholesalers. There is an additional 90p professional fee paid by the NHS for each item (except when the item is >£100 in which case the prof. fee is 2% of the total cost)  For private prescriptions (those not prescribed within the NHS) most pharmacies take the DT price and ad 50% to it for the prescription charge.

If they want to be pissed about it, or about having to go somewhere else if it really is an emergency, then they should have brought it in when they got it, 3 weeks ago. We do the best we can to accommodate our patients, but we aren't magicians. The patient has to take some responsibility over their medications and their health. We can't do everything for them."

TalesFromThePharmacy,330tb1,Temperatia,18,Sun Apr 19 03:46:05 2015 UTC,"When I worked at a pain clinic we had this one patient who was.... creative.  The first time she got her month's script and had ""side effects"" by day 2. When asked for the bottle back before giving her another script, she had already flushed them down the toilet like any rational, narcotic addicted person would do. Right?  So after getting another month of a different medication that she's had success with in the past (not me prescribing ), she comes in about a week later claiming to have dropped her entire bottle of Vicodin and Oxycontin down the sink! Oh no!  Instead of saying ""suck it up, buttercup"", our doc decided to give her a refill of a different strength so the insurance would cover it since she would go into withdraw without the meds. Told her to be more careful, blah blah blah.  About another week goes by and she comes in claiming she was at the lake over the weekend and accidentally kicked all her bottles of meds overboard. ALL of them? Well no, not the muscle relaxer or anti-inflammatory. Just the Vicodin, Oxycontin and oh yeah, the Ambien.   I'm just wondering why the patient hasn't been let go at this point. But our doc is finally starting to see the common denominator and starts our obligatory narcotic wean process. Patient is given low doses of the Vicodin and Oxycontin, advised to take them in a weaning dose and given some clonidine (spelling? it's a BP med ) for any withdrawal symptoms. Patient leaves completely dumbfounded about what she did wrong, she was a perfect patient, so on and so forth.  Few days later, patient calls in and claims she has an issue with swallowing and is requesting liquid hydrocodone. We request a swallow study and records. Never hear from her again.  Perhaps this took place over a few months and not weeks. It was years ago, I can't quite remember. I just know I felt like I talked to the bitch every day and was always kinda interested in hearing her next fun adventure with her pills and whether or not our provider was gonna give a fuck and kick her out. She had urine drug testing done with every new claim and I think it was hit and miss whether or not these meds showed up.   So glad I quit that job.

Although in this particular case, since the surgery is next door, walking the script over is probably faster unless the GP is seeing patients at the time."
TalesFromThePharmacy,330oy4,monkeyolsen,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:40:15 2015 UTC,The GP is next door to the pharmacy. We sent the patient over with pretty clear instructions and one of our staff members was in the GP waiting room to hear this response from the doctor. This is the same GP who issued a prescription for a eight week course of liquid penicillin 125mg/5mg at 5ml od and refused to prescribe more than 280ml.
TalesFromThePharmacy,330oy4,monkeyolsen,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:22:55 2015 UTC,"haha ok, then you can see where the problem is. There isn't really much you can do about it.   If you guys have a good relationship with the surgery, a pharmacy manager/pharmacist could go over there (under the pretext of meeting to see what the pharmacy can do better for the surgery and vice versa) and maybe mention it.   280mL is a very strange amount....how did the GP arrive at that. The bottles come in pretty round number sizes from what I remember."
TalesFromThePharmacy,330oy4,monkeyolsen,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:07:37 2015 UTC,"8 weeks = 56 days. 5ml per day for 56 days = 280ml. We always round up to nearest full bottle with antibiotic liquids, so we can give 300ml and be paid for 300ml.   The issue was that penicillin comes as a dry powder and once you add water the resulting solution is only good for seven days. So for an eight week course the patient would need eight bottles. The GP had not specified on the Rx that it was for eight weeks and the quantity was 280ml so we would not be paid for eight bottles, only three. Instead of changing it the GP sent over a scrap of paper with his working out stating ""5ml per day for 56 days = 5 x 56 = 280 . The patient can make this up at home themselves."""

In that case, I think what we usually did was give out one bottle mixed, and then issued an owing for the other two so that the patient could pick them up at a later date.   Alternatively, we could give them one bottle already mixed, and then give them the measured amount of water (in two seaparate bottles) so that they could mix the other two bottles at home themselves as they finished each bottle.   I think I remember a couple patients saying that they could mix it themselves at home, although this doesn't usually happen."

The standard for pharmacies in every single other country I have been to is to have the medications stored behind the counter in boxed blister packs, the patient is then given complete boxes (which also contain the booklet printed by the manufacturer which includes side-effects and possible interactions) which usually have a dosage/name label printed out - by the pharmacy -  and stuck on them."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31k09d,lascaille,5,Mon Apr 6 04:59:59 2015 UTC,"It's far more cost effective to have stock bottles. And plus many medications are not dispenses as unit-of-use the way the manufacturer might intend. A person might be on an antibiotic for 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, 20 days... will you have a box for every option? Having stock bottles of 100 tablets lets you just dispense as much as needed.  Granted, my pharmacy has plenty of unit-of-use bottles that we can slap a label on and ship out (e.g. a Z-pak, a 30-count bottle of omeprazole, etc), but by and large stuff comes in giant stock bottles."

TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,mckinnon3048,2,Sun Apr 5 22:42:57 2015 UTC,"i'm a bit iffy on the math here. are you saying 2 days before i am supposed to have 0 pills in the bottle or 2 days before the grace period. i usually pick up my prescription the day i would run out so that the next day i don't wake up with no medication. is this considered an ""early refill"" or is this a normal refill since it is within the 2 days of the script running out? by picking up my medication one day before it would be empy every month that wouldn't accumulate multiple days worth of extra medicine this month, i would still just have the last day of this month's medicine left.   for example, if i get 56 pills a month taken twice a day for 28 days on the first of the month (Wednesday) and take my medicine the day i pick it up, when i go to refill on the 28th i have 1-2 pills left for that day and then the 29th would have 0 left and start using the new bottle. is that an early refill or would an early refill be going in on the 26th? if i did that every month, i'm not going to suddenly have 3-6 pills extra accumulated 3 months later, i would still just have 1-2 pills left the day i go in with my prescription."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Brontosaurus_Bukkake,3,Mon Apr 6 03:44:33 2015 UTC,2 days before 0.. I wouldn't flag that after day 26 of 28... That's totally ok.
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,mckinnon3048,3,Mon Apr 6 21:26:07 2015 UTC,"Ok cool. That makes sense to me and it's good you're consistent about it.  It's a bit hard from a patient side navigating what constitutes early at different chains and with different pharmacists, I don't want to have a blemished record. I read through Walgreens updated flagging system that I think they introduced in 2013 would have flagged me for being on my long term pain meds for more than six months (as if I would change a working formula after six months because consistency is bad I guess), picking it up the day before I ran out (according the the pharmacist I was supposed to only fill it when I had 0 left), paying my copay in cash, and they also refused to disclose my diagnosis code that they're apparently supposed to get (only chain I know of that requires this) to another Walgreen location when they had run out and I had to use another Walgreens location. CVS was all over the place with the grace period, they would give me three days sometimes, one time four when I was going on vacation and showed them my plane tickets, and then two or less, but this was only when they'd actually fill for me because most of the time I was told I'm too young to be on what I am on and at one point was verbally lashed at by a new young fresh out of residency pharmacist. This was only 're the instant release controlx they gave me three days for the extended release C2 I was on for some reason, but I like to just have everything the same day to make it easier to track my refill dates for all my different meds. I'm with rite aid now and I know that I get two days strictly, except the one time a floater who didn't know me refused to even give me it on the exact refill day, after trying to embarrass me in front of a bunch of customers and my mother by making me use a calculator to see that I was wrong about the number of days it had been, but still refused after I showed him it was due that day. I'm lucky to have consistency now, but as a pharmacist on here reminded me yesterday, if my pharmacist leaves and is replaced by someone who doesn't know me and my situation I may end up back into the uncertainty zone. I honestly wish they would just have a uniform regulation for drug refills and let that be the rule. Whether I'm on synthroid or pain medication, I need them both every day, it makes no sense to give me my synthroid a week early and then flag me if I ask to just have all my medicines the same time or act as though I've done something wrong when I come in three days before instead of giving me the benefit of the doubt that I'm using my medicine correctly and just want to make one trip to the pharmacy. Sorry for the rant it is a sensitive topic."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Brontosaurus_Bukkake,5,Tue Apr 7 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"No, totally understand. It sucks to need them anyway, much less when you have to jump hoops to get them.  It's basically a hierarchy of 1: follow the law 2: protect our licenses 3: patient needs 4: customer service  Basically it's cover our asses, cover my ass, cover your ass, then how can I help you.  And fuck that rph that wouldn't listen to reason and math... The ones like that make tech jobs harder by giving us more reasons for people to get upset with us... Our system where I work shows me the number of days past over total day supply... So I see alprazolam 1mg 26/28 and know it's only 2 days to empty."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,pizy1,4,Tue Apr 7 01:50:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah I try to never take it out on the people working there because I know it's a job and they aren't the reason things are hard. Like I'd never get mad at a tech just because the rph was a dick. But my mom is a physician and was kind of shocked by how he was talking to me as he didn't realize she was my mom and knows the normal pharmacists there so she filed a complaint against him. At the very beginning she was a bit skeptical about my complaints about the system but after that she's became a lot more understanding regarding my frustration with the system because even though that was a very isolated experience since I consolidated at rite aid, she kind of realized that I wasn't exaggerating about what I'd been dealing with the past year and a half before then when I'd come back from the pharmacy quest exhausted and dejected.   At the end of the day, even for the good pharmacists the system makes life hell for them when it comes to patient like me. I'm young and on a statistically abnormal amount of pain killers for a person my age. They don't want to lose their license and I'd never want anyone to risk or lose their job for me. So I don't take the scrutiny in the process personally. I just want to be treated like a human and I wish that the default would be to treat everyone like one even if it's totally obvious they're a seeker. That way the worst that happens is they have to be nice to someone who doesn't necessarily deserve it instead of being mean or cold to someone who is already going through a lot. I know most pharmacists are good people and not the circle jerk characterization that subs like opiates have painted them to be. But there are still some bad apples and when I see some stories here and on pharmacy of people joking or commenting about how they showed some junkie what's what or denied someone medicine and laugh about it, it just reminds me that the times I went to the pharmacy in my sweats and a hoodie because it was too painful to change into more professional looking clothes and got denied my meds I could have easily been the person in those stories. I know that when I'm in pain and dressed in my comfortable clothes I look like a hot mess. There's undoubtedly a serious problem with abuse in the country and there isn't a simple solution but I just wish that to the default for some people wasn't to be mean about things, simply because the risk of targeting the wrong person is very real. To me the solution is obvious: the government should leave it to physicians and pharmacists to decide what medical needs a patient has and what the appropriate treatment is. Not a politician trying to score points because an abuser overdoses and they decide that instead of putting resources into helping people with a problem they'd rather make pain management an Orwellian nightmare."

This is how I operate and this is how I wish everyone would do it, too. I think treating people judgmentally comes from an initial place of frustration, but sometimes it's not even that tech's (since techs are usually the first person you're dealing with at drop-off) personal frustration. Instead it's that they learned that it's okay to be rude to people on 'those' kinds of drugs because that's how they see their pharmacist treat them, but the pharmacist is only that way because they're annoyed at how much of their day boils down to being 'drug police,' etc etc, so on and so forth. But even when someone hands me a script that's dubious (suspicious but not in the fake-as-hell category), I'll still fake sympathy about 'not having it in stock' when I hand it back to them. I'm not gonna be a dick to a person who's only just handed me a script and done nothing else to personally offend me. I just don't see the point."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,pizy1,1 point,Tue Apr 7 14:07:20 2015 UTC,I think you're dead on about why it happens in a lot of cases and I'm sure that if someone was creating extra work for me on a daily basis I'd get resentful too and I'd like to think I would still treat them with dignity to their face at least. I'm glad you're like this it shows a lot about your character. Out of curiosity is a suspicious albeit not fake script mean coming from a clinic you don't trust or more of a quantity/drug/dose that doesn't match the patient's history or age kind of situation? Are there clinics near you that are notorious mills or is it more along the lines of thinking that person is pulling a fast one on that clinic?
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,YallNeedRhllor,2,Tue Apr 7 14:36:48 2015 UTC,"What constitutes ""suspicious"" can be so different from pharmacy to pharmacy, from region to region, so I'm only speaking for my experience at my one pharmacy here. Age definitely not a factor in what I deem suspicious or not, I understand people of all ages can be in pain and not 'look' like they're in pain. History not so much either (unless you're trying to get oxycodone when you just picked up a Suboxone script last week). Sloppily written prescriptions for any controlled medication (not just painkillers, but benzos like Xanax and Ativan, we get a lot of suspicious scripts for those, too) from doctors we've never heard of are the most eyebrow-raising for us. High quantities or higher dosages of things like oxycodone or Percocet with no history of filling with our chain, plus the ole' ""I'd like to pay cash"" with no explanation why."

And yeah a day or two days is reasonable, two days keeps us out of legal trouble if someone ODs or gets caught abusing/selling, and doesn't allow people to really stockpile any significant quantities.. While at the same time not making people wait until they're actually out of medication before coming in.  I've got a friend who works where the filling date is day 30/30...

Some are simple like Drug-Drug (Coumadin and Aspirin interact with each other, or you're filling different medications that both have acetaminophen in them) or Drug-Age (low or high dose based on age) or High/Low Dose based on typical effective dose, and some insurances will pop the DUR reject that it's interacting with itself if it is being refilled too early."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,isaackleiner,2,Wed May 6 16:35:44 2015 UTC,When I first got into Pain Management the Pharmacist at my Pharmacy was a hard 30/30 'person'.  The techs even hated her.  Since her they have been a revolving door of pharmacist  (including one who I think got addicted to an in store substance and 'went away').    My old prescription explicitly said 30 days.  The wording changed at some point

Maybe it's just my personal genetic makeup, but I don't even get the obsession with them. I got a script for something like 15-20 of them after a root canal early in 2014, and I did double up on them for the first couple days just because it hurt like a mofo and I'm a total pussy with a low pain tolerance. It worked on the pain, but all I felt was a very minor buzz almost identical to what I could have gotten from a few beers ... and even that only happened on day one. Day two I didn't feel a thing. Oh well, maybe if I'd taken 10, but I'm kind of a fan of my liver.)"

Traditionally, true Vicodin was 500 mg of acetaminophen per tablet. There have been growing concerns in recent years about acetaminophen overdose causing liver disease in patients on chronic pain meds. If you think about it, tons of drugs have acetaminophen in them. Suppose you're Joe patient with chronic back pain. You take one Vicodin 5/500 every six hours. You also take two extra strength Tylenol three times a day for your arthritis, and you've recently gotten a head cold, so you take a store branded sinus pressure and pain medication four times a day as well. That's 6.3 GRAMS of acetaminophen a day.   So about a year ago, the FDA ""requested"" the manufacturers of acetaminophen-containing combination products ""voluntarily withdraw"" from the market all products containing more than 325 mg of acetaminophen per tablet/dose.   Norco was the brand name of all strengths of hydrocodone combo products that contained 325mg of acetaminophen per tablet. Hence, now you hear about Norco because it's all that's available."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Levofloxacin,3,Sun Apr 5 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"i'm just posting this to elaborate on what you've posted as it is an important issue and the devil is in the details  while it was just a ""request"", they've indicated that they will rescind approval for drugs not meeting the new guidelines regarding the lower APAP dosage per pill. I don't think people really recognize how dangerous tylenol in a chronic use setting, and even in high single day dosages. if i'm not mistaken a single daily dosage over 5,600 mg can cause slight liver damage, not to mention the people taking 3+ grams a day with long term vicodin or percocet scripts before the guidelines changed, it really fucks things up in their liver and they often aren't even informed about this when they get that prescription. it has this perception of being a harmless OTC medication when really it is the pharmaceutical responsible for the most calls to poison control, ER visits, hospitalizations, and deaths  (https://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/tylenol-safe-painkiller-or-drug-of-hepatic-destruction/ and http://www.poison.org/prevent/documents/TESS%20Annual%20Report%202004.pdf)"
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Igra143,2,Mon Apr 6 03:57:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly, some small part of me thinks some doctors/medical groups PREFER things like hydrocodone have APAP in them solely to reduce the ease of abuse. So what if someone with a serious opioid addiction would need it so bad they wouldn't even care about the risk?  Just let doctors prescribe straight 5mg oxycodone without having to feel they're risking their medical license every time they do so, and tell the patient to add Tylenol (or, probably better, ibuprofen) as needed. Most people will take it as prescribed, and the few that don't at least won't be at risk of a pretty unpleasant way of dying."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,hahaz13,6,Mon Apr 6 18:28:37 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. The whole patient population shouldn't be put at risk just to teach the bad apples a lesson or to control behavior of abusers. It honestly makes no sense. From a policy stand point it's like ""well when they die then they'll regret doing drugs! Brilliant."" I'd rather be able to get the medicine I need without jumping through hoops and for a while dealing with dirty looks and verbal abuse and have addicts than make life difficult for people that need it just so that we can ""prevent"" inappropriate usage, which really just results in more crime and clearly a failed abuse presentation program. Like we have stores at every corner and most restaurants selling alcohol in 1.5 liter jugs for $20 and then act like people taking pills is some scourge on society and the patients that need it get treated like sub humans while the doctors worry about losing their license if they exceed a quota that doesn't account for the possibility that more patients than expected may need pain killers in a given month, and pharmacists with the DEA breathing down their backs. All because the gov cares about preventing the abuse of addicting substances...unless they're hepatoxic alcohol or cancer causing cigarettes then it's all cool just tax it."

If my pharmacy sees this (and knows what it is), then they are probably not suspicious of me at all, I would think."

I get what your saying about personally setting off warning bells. Makes a lot of sense. This obviously isn't the same thing, but long ago I used to work in used bookstores. Most people came in selling their stuff like normal. But there was always a subsection of grubby, agitated, or obviously high people that would come in and somehow have brand new stuff to sell, still in the manufacturer's wrappers. They were clearly junkies or meth users, or whatever and they had stolen the stuff. I'm sure there are plenty of idiots like that for customers in pharmacy work."

Say a case where they're a long-term customer who's never tried such an excuse on you before. What are your options?  I know when I first got my one C2 script from my current doctor, he made it crystal clear to treat both the script itself  each month and the bottle of pills like they were made out of gold, because he would never provide a backup script under any circumstances no matter how legitimate. (He also said this was to protect his own butt legally, not that he thought I'd abuse them.)"
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,unbang,2,Mon Apr 6 19:00:24 2015 UTC,"On the rare occasion... The Dr has to write a new prescription obviously, so if that's impossible you're SOL... But if the Doctor will... Then we have to hear from the Dr specifying why you need it early and that they're ok with that...  Insurance will almost NEVER cover a lost rx.. And if it's stolen the Dr will always want a copy of the police report."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,unbang,4,Mon Apr 6 21:18:18 2015 UTC,The doctor might write or type 756.83 on the scripts to indicate your condition but someone who is faking a script could just as easily write 756.83 or the ICD code for any other chronic pain condition.
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,toastthemost,3,Sun Apr 5 06:49:50 2015 UTC,"If you have a very specific chronic condition, let the pharmacy know what the condition is, and explain the condition to the staff.  Don't assume that they know what the condition is.  Pharmacists learn a very broad base of disease states and their treatments, but we learn so many more when we start to practice.  Everyone just needs to be nice, and understand that we want to help you.  If your pharmacy is not nice to you after that; there is another pharmacy down the road with an eager staff waiting to take care of you."

TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Hellavor,3,Sun Apr 5 16:36:09 2015 UTC,"I know they can't see the diagnosis; that would be a massive HIPAA violation to just have all your personal medical data automatically tied in to a pharmacy's computer system.   But I t's perfectly legal (as far as I understand it, I'm sure I'll be corrected if I'm wrong) for your doctor to discuss it with the pharmacist if he/she calls the doctor for a legitimate reason (say to confirm that a script for an unusually high number of X pills is what the doctor really meant and it wasn't a typo or anything). HIPAA allows for that sort of discussion.   And like the pros have already said above, there's nothing wrong with you volunteering the info if it'll help explain why you're getting so many controlled substances."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,hahaz13,3,Sun Apr 5 16:03:53 2015 UTC,"Ah, that makes sense about HIPAA.   I don't even know if the controls I get are enough for them to really question me. It's more like how long I've been on them. Once a month I get 60 50mg tramadol and 10mcg per hour butrans patch. Other than that, I get 30 5mg diazepam for muscle spasms and a compounded cream for pain and muscle spasms about once a year. So, there are really only two controls that I get on a regular basis, and one of them is a patch, which is probably difficult to abuse. I don't get a lot of meds and they aren't the really serious controlled substances like oxywhatever, etc."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,pizy1,3,Sun Apr 5 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tramadol and Valium sound pretty low-key, especially since you've been on them for a long time, and if they're always coming from the same doctor. I think the flags would go up if you were constantly changing physicians, magically getting scripts for way higher dosages and numbers of those medications than you're getting, stuff like that."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Nick1693,2,Sun Apr 5 17:03:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they always come from the same doctor. And that doctor is literally three office spaces down from the pharmacy too. Dosages, # per month, etc. doesn't change."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,unbang,3,Sun Apr 5 17:10:29 2015 UTC,"Actually just to correct you - it's not a HIPAA violation at all. You can share medical information as long as it is within the scope of care. Doctors can and do send them even if not required by law, because everytime you go to the doctor they bill you under a certain code. For example, you might have a simple sinus infection or you can have a sinus infection that has spread to you ear canals and those will have different codes associated with them."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,jc8n6,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:37:13 2015 UTC,"Really? They always send the (ICD?) codes over on every prescription? Huh, didn't know that.

TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,unbang,1 point,Mon Apr 6 18:41:51 2015 UTC,"Not always. Less often than not. It depends on their system -- sometimes they prepopulate because they use the same form for billing insurance as they do to send the script to the pharmacy.  Just off the top of my head, it can be important when dosing antibiotics for children because certain conditions will require a different strength of antibiotic. Sometimes it can also be helpful when dispensing controlled substances for auditing purposes - you could be getting xanax and we don't know why and your doctor might just be prescribing it to you because you bugged him into doing it.  Continuity of care extends to pharmacies as well since we technically do provide a medical service, as hazy as it has gotten recently."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,unbang,2,Mon Apr 6 18:57:29 2015 UTC,"Can pharmacists and pharmacy techs see a patient's diagnosis? If so, I would think that would help with determining if something is a red flag or not.   Another longer-letter chain does this for their verification calls on certain narcs. Many prescribers have started putting diagnosis codes on the controlled RXs for this reason."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Brontosaurus_Bukkake,2,Mon Apr 6 02:35:18 2015 UTC,"when i went to walgreens to get my pain medication they required a diagnosis code in order to fill it. they also would not confirm this confirmed diagnosis code with another walgreens location which caused a nightmare for me when i had to go to a different location one weekend. took an hour of begging and they finally relented and gave the pharmacy i was at the code and they filled my script. i switched to a rite aid that knows me and my situation and honestly those people genuinely care about me and look out for me. if a pharmacist saw my list of meds in a vacuum it would be a red flag, but when you get to know them and they know what's going on in your life medically and otherwise, they are humans too and can be your best advocate. i no longer worry about whether i'll get my refill when i run out anymore or the dirty looks or lies about it being out of stock anymore. my best advice would be if you have a contract with a pain management center, take it with you to the pharmacy and ask if they will take you on as a regular pain patient and just go to them every month without fail. be nice, don't get hostile if they ask you questions or can't refill you early, etc. and they will remember you as a pain med patient that isn't a drug seeker or asshole and honestly they may even remember you better than their normal patients simply because having a legit pain patient is like a diamond in the rough when they have to deal with assholes all the time both on the fake patient end and the DEA end."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,unbang,11,Mon Apr 6 04:03:11 2015 UTC,"And yet they have no problem updating the system when it saves or makes them money, ie PCQ interfaces.  God forbid they should actually push out an update when it's something that would help the staff."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Brontosaurus_Bukkake,11,Sat Apr 4 18:58:30 2015 UTC,Sigh I know.  That new update that forces you to type c to continue to confirm whether or not you put in the right drug at dropoff is infuriating. I'm so used to my typing routine and it just stalls me there when I keep forgetting. And not to mention it's fucking stupid because the pharmacist is verifying it anyway.

TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Brontosaurus_Bukkake,4,Mon Apr 6 01:16:29 2015 UTC,But then you have to pay more to get good techs who don't quit after two days. True story.

Honestly, it's hard to say the impact of your early control filling. It depends on the store and the staff at your store. Personally, I never judge anyone's refill tendencies UNLESS they lie to me. Case in point: last week, guy drops off C2, states he has no insurance, but they just filled the same script a week ago at another chain or another guy who also said the same thing and also filled at another chain and when confronted then changed his story. The only time I would ever add a note to someone's profile is if they do shady shit like that.  I can't tell you the number of times someone will try to refill online but put the pickup date as...three days from now, for example, putting the date that they really wanted the drug in range. What they didn't know is that the date of service is always the date that they actually process the refill and that's the date that any auditor will look at. So then I have to call them and tell them they're too soon, they tell me they know, and we're on our merry way."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Brontosaurus_Bukkake,5,Sat Apr 4 20:46:02 2015 UTC,"What's the protocol for the last situation? Do you tell them they have to call back on that day? 'Cause I know people are gonna bitch about that, they hate when we can't just take care of everything for them, lol."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,toastthemost,3,Sat Apr 4 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"Nope, we have a RTS folder and we will print out their profile and write ""refill xx/xx"". Then that date whoever the pharmacist is pulls them out for that day and fills them, or if the tech is nice the night before, they will leave them laying out for the pharmacist. We usually tell people it will be ready about 10 am that day. Pretty much any store I've worked at does it that way."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,DarthLurtz,2,Sat Apr 4 21:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in my case those two times I trusted the three-letter pharmacy web site and requested the refills too early, they called me and said they'd ""have it drop"" the day it could be filled. Both times I got a text message saying it was ready for pickup at like 9:15 am those days.   Then I got paranoid about seeming too eager and waited till 2 or 3 in the afternoon to get them."
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,jc8n6,2,Sun Apr 5 16:13:09 2015 UTC,How do these people even get multiple C2 scripts so close together? Doctor shopping? I thought all the state prescription spying programs caught all those things these days.
TalesFromThePharmacy,31fut8,Royal-Al,2,Sun Apr 5 16:15:25 2015 UTC,"It's possible. I really don't know. Sometimes some people will see one doctor for one chain and another doctor for another chain. Doctors don't really check the prescription monitoring site and I've noticed a lot don't care -- case in point, had a guy that was 2 weeks early and the doctor said to just fill it anyway...so. Some pharmacists don't check the PMP, some pharmacists check and still don't care.  To answer your other comment -- I wouldn't worry about them thinking you're too eager or whatever. The only thing that pisses me off in that case is if the pharmacy opens at 8 and you're already waiting at the gate at 7:55 for your controlled substance."

I was working as a tech at a 3-letter pharmacy, and a man came in wanting a 90-day refill on his Rx. I open the file and someone wrote ""asshole"" in the comments field of his chart. I see his insurance doesn't allow more than 30-day refills at a time, and I explain this to him. He gets angry, insisting he always gets 90 days. The history screen shows this has never been true. He starts living up to the note. To make him happy, I submit the claim, and get a rejection within 10 seconds. I print out the screen and show him the rejection message.  He looks at the screenshot and says ""what's this written next to my name?"" My blood runs cold as I realize I didn't tear off the rest of the screenshot and he sees the Asshole comment next to his name. I just realized I'm probably going to be fired for this, even though I didn't type it. I pretend not to notice it, then he jabs his finger on the DOS-formatted word and he asks me again louder. ""Um..."" I think. My first thought was to say, ""Sir, I don't see anything. You mean A-55-H-Zero.."" His glare makes me stop that excuse. I think quickly, raise my eyebrows and say, ""Your INSURANCE must have put that in there! How outrageous. It's from them, since this is the screen they send us. You should call them."" He swears he will, and storms off. I wipe the sweat from my brow and run in back to count pills instead.

I haven't started a new drug in a couple years now so everything I am on I have been on for at least 2 to 12 years. I don't need a pharmacist to offer me the consult for me to say no to it, I can just have a tech ask or a cashier. Especially since depending on the pharmacist some of them say I should just read the pamphlet that comes with the meds. Others are very good and tell me things I didn't know before, but there are always one or two that cannot be bothered.   I'm glad it's not a law in my state.

If it's a refill, I'll just sell it to them and only get the RPh if the patient asks for one, or tries asking me a question out of my scope of practice.

It was probably a diesel. For some reason ppl leave their diesel trucks running forever. I had a customer come into my store and they left their truck running for a good 90 mins. I asked why, he said it was bc it takes less gas and they take forever to warm back up. This may be bs."

I tend to kill my battery at least twice a year because I drive shorter distances than most people with a diesel do and my car never gets a chance to recharge it.  In the winter it takes 15 minutes for my car to warm up in Texas which is warmer than most.  Though 90 minutes is ridiculous and I wouldn't do that, but I would for a half hour."

""But I have a new prescription!"".   I explain that insurance can NOT care less about this, they know he filled it just couple of weeks ago and they will not pay for the same thing twice.    That is the expression.   ""But I LOST IT"". Lol, seriously? You were dumb enough to lose your meds and you expect someone else to pay for this?    Because accidents never happen and everyone is perfect.   Anyway, I say that the only way for him to get his meds is to pay cash, which would be $87 for 30 days. I even offered him out discount program which would knock another $15-20.    Reasonable.   Nope. He wants me to call his insurance. And as if I have nothing better to do on busy afternoon, I do so,    Literally part of your job. Stop complaining.   insurance reply goes ""LOL, no way"" and we share a laugh. I inform the man about this outcome   You are not a nice person.   and he just keeps standing here, staring at me and finally says ""Are you gonna do something for me or not"". At this point I am fed up and just say ""No"".   He probably could have picked a better phrase.   I am sure this happened to everybody here.    Yep. And its our job to deal with it like adults, not temperamental children.   People are just idiots like that.   Wow. You are a terrible person.   The lack of personal responsibility is something I can't stand and frankly, these days this is one of the main major things that's wrong with out society - lack of responsibility and overload of entitlement.   Careful, you might hurt your shoulder reaching that far. Everyone has a bad day, and the man wasn't entitled. Medication can be a necessity, and keeping people from getting it can cause distress. Its your job to deal with it and help your customers understand without being rude.   Consider a new line of work."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,Rxasaurus,11,Sat Mar 21 15:29:03 2015 UTC,"Good points overall, but I do have to wonder when negotiating with insurances on behalf of patients became our job. I have no problems resolving insurance issues, but why should the patient not have any responsibility to ever talk to their own insurance?"
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,amileandahalf,2,Sat Mar 21 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"Always have the patient call, I rarely let my techs call with insurance problems anymore."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,Chobitpersocom,2,Tue Mar 24 15:12:11 2015 UTC,I think it's better for the pharmacy to call the insurance. In many cases they need info like our NPI that the patient doesn't have. If the insurance is going to do an override they usually have to talk to us anyway.
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,YUNOtiger,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:54:53 2015 UTC,Especially involving lost/vacation overrides.  Usually the insurance wants to hear it from the patient.
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,DarthLurtz,0,Mon Mar 30 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"Most patients have no idea how to work the insurance system. When you give a person with no background in this stuff a card, that has half a dozen different account/bin/group numbers on it, then another half a dozen phone numbers, it can be overwhelming. So what do you do?  Either A) do what this person did, and complain about how ""stupid"" people are, then call their insurance for them. Or B) take a few minutes to explain to the patient 1) what the issue is, 2) why it is their responsibility to fix it, and 3) show them how they can go about contacting the insurance."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,YUNOtiger,4,Sat Mar 21 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"That's a commendable approach to the job, but it still doesn't seem natural. If I damaged my car, I would not take it to a mechanic and ask them to work out the details with my insurance, ""I'll be back in an hour to pick it up thanks!""  There are plenty of analogous situations, and it seems pharmacies are unique in being middlemen between people and their insurances."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,iceandlies,2,Sat Mar 21 16:01:27 2015 UTC,"Car insurance is a lot less complicated than health insurance, and people tend to care more about their personal health than their car, I think."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,DarthLurtz,6,Sat Mar 21 16:04:34 2015 UTC,"And yet, people are more willing to get their hands dirty and actually get involved with their insurance when it comes to their car than their health."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,rofosho,3,Sat Mar 21 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"It is more important, and that's why its frustrating that they pay much less attention to how it works and are unwilling to learn, preferring to dump all responsibility onto us and complain when they result they pursue is not possible."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,Chobitpersocom,2,Sat Mar 21 16:37:49 2015 UTC,"I beg to differ, cash insurance and car issues can be a big pain and confusing"
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,mskarD2,4,Sat Mar 21 18:08:05 2015 UTC,That's harsh. The expectation doesn't make it any less frustrating for the tech. The tech called the insurance. Did everything he could. Part of this sub is being able to rant. I don't think I would have been happy either doing everything I could legally do to be met with the attitude that I didn't do jack shit.  We're expected to be helpful but taking sole responsibility for a patient's mistake is not part of our job.   We do have limits. Did you want OP to pay for it himself?
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,vitras,2,Mon Mar 30 13:49:47 2015 UTC,"After nicely doing everything I can legally do and getting nowhere, I would suggest the patient call his insurance himself for an explanation.

TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,unbang,4,Tue Mar 24 15:54:27 2015 UTC,"It's really not. It benefits the patient to get involved in their own health insurance and request these things themselves. I have heard on numerous occasions from my techs that the insurance wants the patient to contact the company. So, I made it my store's policy that we do not contact the insurance unless we absolutely have to. This has relieved stress on the techs, freed up time to focus on safer filling, and has greatly reduced our wait times. Our satisfaction scores have gone up, customer service has increased, and our patients have increased their knowledge on their own healthcare.   Also, not a tech, but thanks!"
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,OhHiItsMe,1 point,Tue Mar 24 22:17:09 2015 UTC,"Every time the customer calls their insurance, they tell them that the pharmacy needs to call for a lost medication override.

TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,Moirali,1 point,Thu May 14 02:08:04 2015 UTC,Has anyone actually resolved something like this? I heard from my co-workers something along the lines of having the patient file a police report and then maybe have the insurance do an override.
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zs4mb,legrange1,1 point,Sat Mar 21 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"I have, but it's a pain in the ass and it only works on stolen meds, not lost. They file the report and they inform the insurance they should get a case number. Then they bring the report to the pharmacy, if the insurance didn't already call the pharmacy then the Pharmacy calls for the override.  Pharmacy should also get case number.    Pharmacy makes a copy of police report and keeps it on file.   Pray pharmacy actually gets paid."

TalesFromThePharmacy,2zq8xy,sfvalet,14,Sat Mar 21 15:30:54 2015 UTC,They use a cubing software that computes the space requirements for a truckload of product. Each piece of product is pre-measured (h x l x w) and entered in to the software so it can calculate the space needed.  Works pretty well most of the time until you get to the end of an order and have a few odd pieces left over.

Though I do prefer this to when they stuff the tote so full that it actually crushes a few boxes.  Then if we happen to not use whatever's in the said crushed box before the expiration and it needs to be sent back we get a handling charge because it's damaged.  Well, no shit it's damaged, you guys are the ones who damaged it.  McKesson is really great, honestly, we get our order everyday.  But dude, the handling charges are stupid.  ""Changed to unsaleable return"" because there's some sticker goo on it and we get no refund?  We get stuff with preexisting sticker goo all the time, can't tell me you don't sell that shit.

TalesFromThePharmacy,2znq4s,Pagandeva2000,5,Sat Mar 21 13:12:00 2015 UTC,"Do you have rx30? Be careful if you do, because if you try to cancel out a transaction after they swipe, it charges them regardless"
TalesFromThePharmacy,2znq4s,Fadoody,5,Fri Mar 20 15:08:00 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, but if it did charge him twice that would be so wonderful of a cherry on top for that idiot."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2znq4s,mskarD2,4,Fri Mar 20 16:50:35 2015 UTC,"I had a new patient (with a very common name like Mike Smith) trying to fill a prescription, so I ask all the usual information. When I got to DOB, he told me his lawyer says that legally I can't ask for that and he doesn't have to provide it. Yet, he wants me to bill his insurance. I explained seven ways to Sunday why we need his DOB. I finally had to send him on his way with his Rx to the next poor Pharmacy. Best of luck to you, Buddy."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2znq4s,AwayFromBlighty,2,Sat Mar 21 16:02:43 2015 UTC,"Had a similar situation working in Walgreens once.. Corporate looking man wanted to pay with his credit cards but told me that I didn't need to know his zip.  Me""well I do I'm afraid sir""  Him""let's just swipe it again""  Me""ok sir but I can promise it will still ask for your zip code""  Him""oh no. You don't need to know that""  Me""are you afraid I might canvas the entire 4 block radius that zip code covers to find your house?""  Him""no but I just don't think you need to know such personal information""  Me""we will have to agree to disagree on a number of issues sir.. Your items will be waiting for you when you decide to pay for them.. Have a good day sir""  (sorry about formatting.. Commenting on my phone)"
TalesFromThePharmacy,2znq4s,Samy42,2,Fri Mar 27 19:05:09 2015 UTC,"I read a study recently that proves you can identify 87% of the US population with just DOB, gender, and zip code. (By comparing it to publicly reported voter info). Just a fun fact"

TalesFromThePharmacy,2znq4s,Ssj4coin,1 point,Sat Mar 21 13:08:09 2015 UTC,a new patient came to get a flu shot and didn't want to provide us with his information and told us to invent an idenitity for him and bill his insurance. Pharmacist told him we can't do that and he started screaming and left.
TalesFromThePharmacy,2znq4s,MartyMcMuffin,1 point,Thu Mar 26 10:45:44 2015 UTC,"The area I live in has about four different zip codes, but it's a large area and one zip code covers 25% (or so) of the area. It's not unheard of to have one side of the street to have one zip code and the other side to have another.  During my time at Craft, INC the company would ask us peons to gather zip codes, my guess was to see if they needed to build another store if there were a lot of people coming from other areas. I was only trained on a register at the tail end of my time at this store and had do deal with one of these gatherings and had numerous people complain about it as though I was asking for their SSN or something.  I told one persistent man that I could do nothing with a zip code and that about 200,000 OTHER people had the same. damn. zip. code. as he did."

TalesFromThePharmacy,2zjsr9,Idiotsandcheapskate,28,Thu Mar 19 03:45:29 2015 UTC,"My great grandma was like that. She made it to 107 and she was sharp as hell. On her 90th birthday, she took her road test to get her license renewed at the DMV just to prove she could, then sold her car because she didn't want her kids to have the burden of taking her keys from her when the time came. She mowed her own lawn (and sometimes her next door neighbor's lawn when it got too long and annoyed her) until she was 95. She was walking, running her own errands, and knew everyone's name that she came across until the day she died.   My perspective on exactly how old she was was always tied to her house. She was the original owner of her home and bought it in her 20's when she got married. She paid $3200 for her house. She sold it a few years before she died for over $500,000. She ran a steel mill during WWII from what I'm told. I absolutely love old people like that!"
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zjsr9,mcnuggetskitty,13,Thu Mar 19 05:32:25 2015 UTC,"When I first started in the pharmacy in the 90s we had a patient who was over 100. She was born in 1894. If I had to guess her age I would have thought late seventies. She had a sharp mind and a classy sense of style.   Computer always warned us against the improper pediatric dosage. Oh, Y2K... I remember you still."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zjsr9,amileandahalf,5,Thu Mar 19 09:42:23 2015 UTC,"I had a 99 year old patient in the ER with an imposing list of meds of which he knew, by heart, the names, dosages, time he last took them and where he refilled, plus the phone number of the pharmacy off the top of his head. All of this plus took time to tell jokes and flirt with me. Still remember his name and won't ever forget him."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zjsr9,Ghost_of_Mary_Todd,3,Sat Mar 21 00:52:23 2015 UTC,I think my favorite part about working in a pharmacy is the senior citizens. They just make my day sometimes.
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zjsr9,Dope1226,1 point,Thu Mar 19 05:06:47 2015 UTC,Absolutely!  Most of my favorite customers are seniors. Not to mention my old mall walker friends at my mall job. I love me some old folks!
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zjsr9,OhHiItsMe,3,Thu Mar 19 17:25:26 2015 UTC,My great grandmother died a couple years ago. She was born in 1909 and was a teacher in a one room schoolhouse.
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zjsr9,Serrated_Banana,2,Fri Mar 20 04:41:43 2015 UTC,"Ha, that sounds great.   Reminds me of a regular and she is always like ""I am 92 and as fresh as new."" And then she goes about how her walking aid once got stolen and she is always telling the story like it's the first time. Of course I have heard it about 6 times now.   Otherwise she is fine though."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zhu9z,JeF4y,25,Wed Mar 18 18:32:39 2015 UTC,"I don't know, maybe this is common practice for y'all, but it was my first experience like this in +20 yrs of getting prescriptions filled as an adult.  So, please accept my most sincere THANK YOU to all of you pharmacists & techs who keep people like me sane."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zhu9z,WhitestKidYouKnow,7,Wed Mar 18 18:34:02 2015 UTC,"I'm graduating from pharmacy school in May, and I always try to help people out when I see insane prices like this.  Especially if it's one of the newer blood thinners (Eliquis, Pradaxa, Brilinta, etc...).  If anyone's medications are expensive, you can always refer them to http://www.needymeds.org/index.htm (or print out the page for them if you're working in the pharmacy).  It basically links to the manufacturer's patient assistance programs.  I've used it quite a few times on clinicals for patients being discharged on pricey meds."
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zhu9z,residentchubbychaser,2,Wed Mar 18 22:13:07 2015 UTC,"Neat, I may have to check this out. My Abilify can run upwards of $900 a month, though my mom may have found a coupon recently to knock that down to $5 a month. I actually will be finding out whether it works tomorrow."

If you have any problems with it, call the 800# for it and talk to them.  They can do overrides to make it work.  Also, just so you know, a generic for abilify comes out next month!!!"

TalesFromThePharmacy,2zhu9z,LumenPierce,4,Fri Mar 20 19:26:12 2015 UTC,This use to be my favorite part of my job as a tech in a specialty pharmacy. I would work with the insurance and drug company to get the price down as low as I could on the meds that cost thousands each month. So happy you have an awesome RPh!!
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zhu9z,Chilly73,2,Thu Mar 19 09:12:06 2015 UTC,I'm sure it can be as rewarding to both sides.  It was really really cool (and NEEDED!).
TalesFromThePharmacy,2zhu9z,Fyzzle,2,Thu Mar 19 12:50:41 2015 UTC,"That happened to me with my prescription for Zegerid. My Doctor wrote me the rx to save me money with not having to buy it OTC.  When I saw ""Insurance:NA"" on my Walgreens app, I was just like ""okay, I guess it won't be filled"".  Then the next day I got an alert that it was ready for pick up with a $75 copay, and since OTC is about $25 per month, there was no point in getting it.  Then the next day I got another alert saying that it wasn't ready for pick up.  Finally I got an alert saying it was ready with a $15 copay.  Sure, it only saved me $10 or so, but that's still $10 saved.  Apparently the Pharmacist busted his ass in getting this covered for me!"
