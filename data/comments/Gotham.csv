Gotham,3e5ce6,thecastingforecast,3,Wed Jul 22 03:17:27 2015 UTC,....who is this character?
Gotham,3e5ce6,HollandGW215,4,Wed Jul 22 02:54:00 2015 UTC,"Captain Barnes is an original character, but fortunately, the Gotham producers have provided an intriguing description. The GCPD’s new captain “lands on the GCPD like a tornado, ripping out the dead wood of Gotham’s police force. He is a law and order zealot; unafraid of making enemies – on either side of the law. For Gordon (Ben McKenzie), Barnes is a hero and a mentor, someone with whom he can share the burden of heroism. Captain Barnes proves himself to be a strong ally to Gordon… but one day he will make an equally powerful enemy.   http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2015/07/21/casting-news-michael-chiklis-joins-gotham"

Gotham,3dxo08,the_fella,23,Mon Jul 20 11:37:23 2015 UTC,"Did you see the finale? (If not: FINALE SPOILERS UNDERNEATH).  SPOILER He says as much in the season finale, but it's fairly apparent in the previous episodes, especially the one where her takeover fails and he rescues her. He's ready to sacrifice his life so she can escape Zsasz, even if he ends up surviving.  In terms of body language, there's a scene in that episode (12, 13? I can't check, I'm not home.) that is quite revealing. The one where she wakes in some hotel room, and he's here to take care of her. He sits next to her, hands her ice for her injury, and leans over her without really touching her. As they do not kiss or anything, yet he doesn't seem willing to move away, I'd say ""Major case of pining"".   They have known each other for at least ten years too (they took the club from a bookie back then)."

Gotham,3dxo08,JasonWilley777,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:40:19 2015 UTC,"He obviously had ties with high ranked mafia members (see the childhood friend he murdered, and who invited him to leave Fish to join his own gang).

Gotham,3dxe7b,metawohoo,7,Mon Jul 20 09:19:23 2015 UTC,"I had plenty of gripes with the writers in s1, but one thing they did really well were the mob scenes. Maroni & Falcone were great. the Fish character always struck me as over-acted."
Gotham,3dxe7b,wellitsbouttime,5,Mon Jul 20 10:36:49 2015 UTC,"The mob scenes were great. Sal and Carmine negotiating over Oswald's fate was a great moment, and most of their scenes are very interesting.  I kind of see Fish as a ""pre-costumed villain"". She has everything but the mask (which is not even a requirement). She heavily relies on clothing and attitude, so I feel like the over-acting works for the character. I mean, it's the Batman verse. You eventually get evil clowns hijacking TV feeds to announce that they are going to poison a reservoir, or the Riddler in full costume mocking the citizens on gigantic screens... If there's one place in the DC universe where over-acting is the norm, it's Gotham City."
Gotham,3dxe7b,HonorForCorvo,6,Mon Jul 20 10:49:22 2015 UTC,"I'd gladly put up with any bullshit resurrection plots if it meant we could get Sal Maroni back in exchange for getting rid of Fish Mooney forever.  Seriously, they killed off one of the best characters in the show (and a pivotal Batman character to boot) to give her a stupid Girl Power moment? I hope whoever came up with that idea got fired, because that was the most idiotic thing I've seen on the show thus far. And that's saying something.   but he never transferred to a nicer city like, say, Detroit   LOL."
Gotham,3dxe7b,GobbleMyPot,2,Mon Jul 20 09:23:16 2015 UTC,"Well, they can throw his body in some swamp in that yet-to-be-explained Indian Hill, maybe. Admitting Sal was born on a Monday and died on a Saturday, he could come back."

Gotham,3dzky4,YodaFan465,9,Mon Jul 20 20:43:21 2015 UTC,"This show has been so much more entertaining once I let go of any idea that it would ever line up with the comics. Once upon a time, I figured the show would end with Gordon meeting Batman and them going off to clean up the city, with their future being the comics we have already read.  Nah, Gotham isn't going there. Once I let go of ""But it isn't like that  in the comics,"" I've been digging the show much more as its own thing."

Gotham,3dvfi4,MarioSpeedwagon13,7,Sun Jul 19 21:26:22 2015 UTC,"I actually like that better. Hate precedural shows where you mostly just watch them because you need to know what happens and the writing is focused on creating suspense and creating a desire to watch the next episode.  If done well procedural shows are great. But most writers tend to milk that ""next episode"" suspense way too much. I understand it's a ratings thing and execs love that shit. I don't understand how everyone just gobbles it up, though."
Gotham,3dvfi4,PalermoJohn,5,Mon Jul 20 01:21:16 2015 UTC,"I really enjoyed how doctor who did it for the 11th doctor. They had a few 'monster of the week' episodes while they had the larger story arc going on. Sometimes the monster of the week episode would have a minor tie in to the larger story arc, sometimes it didn't. It showed that while investigating the larger problem, all the small stuff was still getting in the way.   Edit: premature submit button pressing syndrome.   Anyway, I think Gotham could do something similar and it would work awesome. Investigate the random psycho, but possibly have a clue discovered that might tie in to the overall story arc, or just have it be non related. Sometimes things don't tie in with everything else."
Gotham,3dvfi4,Ceedub260,-1,Mon Jul 20 03:58:51 2015 UTC,Sadly this is not what focus groups dictate. They want story progression. I blame the internet for our collective ADHD-like tendencies.
Gotham,3dvfi4,PalermoJohn,9,Mon Jul 20 04:03:16 2015 UTC,"My main complaint about Gotham (and it is my favourite comic book show at this point) is that it is going too fast on certain things, mostly on the reveals.  We are seeing too many classic Batman villains treated as throwaway single episode threats, rather than stretching it out into a 2-4 episode thrill.  So I am hoping that the 'multiple mini arcs' means that they are going to slow down and show us more in-depth looks at these foes.  Eagle  (And yeah, Gotham makes great sense!)"
Gotham,3dvfi4,Eagle713,5,Sun Jul 19 22:14:02 2015 UTC,"I totally get what you are saying, but maybe they needed the reveals to hype the show that was questioned about its viability right off the bat. Also, I don't think it's the last of certain villains we will be seeing."

Gotham,3dvfi4,HonorForCorvo,3,Mon Jul 20 09:27:35 2015 UTC,"I would also say that whole Fish storyline on the island was pointless  She should have gone underground in the city then we would have had many useful episodes with her amassing her recruits and indeed luring Selena along, Ivy would have been included as well am sure or would have been on hand and picking up tips for her future self, maybe a young Harley would have been around as well  All this would have laid great groundwork for future younger villains but instead they put her on that god awful island which was a totally pointless plot device and detracted from everything else"
Gotham,3dvfi4,metawohoo,2,Mon Jul 20 10:55:55 2015 UTC,"The whole plot was a very boring ""let's save the character from Jada's departure"" device.  I totally agree on how the opportunity to develop the baby villains was missed. We had Selina and Ivy living in the relative, comfortable safety of Barbara's apartment, away from the streets, not having to worry too much about food or survival.  Then Barbara is abducted - and, from Selina's perspective, it's probably another of Jim's fuckups after the hired assassins debacle in ""Lovecraft"" - and comes back ""off"". It made her place unsafe as hell, and Selina has good instincts and would have scampered, which is likely why Fish found her in the streets at the beginning of the finale.  I feel like there's a whole episode missing where they could have bonded around everything that made Fish interesting to Cat: the strength, the unwavering confidence, the apparent concern for outcasts, and similarities in background (such as Selina's mom possibly being a dead stripper, and Fish's possibly a dead prostitute)."

Gotham,3ds50o,screenwriterjohn,2,Mon Jul 20 00:47:02 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even go so far as to say she friend zoned him. When the show starts she clearly finds him weird and bordering on creepy and is trying to keep their relationship strictly professional, not even friends. I don't recall her ever giving him any signs of interest beyond basic politeness or gratitude when he did something nice. I agree, she is not teasing him. It's his own stubbornness and refusal to take no for an answer that messes with his head, not her actions."
Gotham,3ds50o,girlseekstribe,2,Mon Jul 20 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"David Mazouz tweeted this, implying Riddle Man will be getting himself into a lot of trouble with very important people.   Needless to say, the writers already openly stated he'd be playing a big role in season two. Also in the pre-pilot   airing video, the writers showed a quick scene of the Nygma manically scribbling question marks on a wall. That scene was no where in season 1 so.... Maybe foreshadow?    Also yeah we all know Ms. Cringle is probably going to die (along with Penguin's mother and potentially Barbara). It's only a matter of time. Lotsa ladies gonna go bye bye this season for sure.   We also got hints Penguin and Nygma might work together. I hope they act as a temp crime duo. They could even solve crimes if they wanted to (one gets evidence/connections, one analyses the evidence). These two would be great tools for Jim."

It's not like Barbara is a terribly unusual name.  Besides, the main reason people don't think she'll get killed of is that she's Batgirl's mother. The thing is, she's not. (At least in some versions of DC canon.) Batgirl is Barbara's niece. Batgirl's parents died in a car accident, so she was adopted by her aunt Barbara and uncle James."
Gotham,3ds50o,wbgraphic,-1,Sun Jul 19 09:23:04 2015 UTC,"Smallville killed off Jimmy [Olsen], only to have his cousin, also named Jimmy Olson, at the funeral.   Yeah, and that was almost universally considered a plot tumor and a symptom of Smallville's continued decline into awfulness. Let's not rush Gotham into such awful developments just yet, shall we? We've barely gotten the first season out of the gate.   Besides, the main reason people don't think she'll get killed of is that she's Batgirl's mother. The thing is, she's not. (At least in some versions of DC canon.) Batgirl is Barbara's niece. Batgirl's parents died in a car accident, so she was adopted by her aunt Barbara and uncle James.   Keyword: some versions. The New 52, for example, leaves no ambiguity about this - Barbara is James Gordon's and Barbara Kean's daughter. Plus, there's the whole thing with James' psychotic son, James Jr. whose mother is also Barbara. In fact, that might be what they're angling for - James Jr. was an unstable psycho, and Gotham will probably imply that he inherited this from his mother."

I wonder the importance she'll have in the plot. So far, Bruce only interacted with Selina (in his age range, I mean), and his brush with Thomas Eliott was very short. Otherwise, he's pretty much alone in That One Room. It would be nice to see him get out of the manor and start to establish a presence around his peers as the Wayne heir."

Gotham,3cya9v,wellbluebanana,0,Sun Jul 12 19:55:59 2015 UTC,LOL. I thought this was a link to the comic-con panel.
Gotham,3cya9v,L00KA,-5,Sun Jul 12 23:16:43 2015 UTC,Thanks to you guys now I stared at Bicondova's nip.

Gotham,3d0ddn,JasonWilley777,7,Sun Jul 12 12:54:36 2015 UTC,"For most of the first season, I thought she could not act to save her life. But she did a convincing job in the anvil or the hammer, and during her ""therapy"" scenes with Leslie, so I think she might just have been given subpar material. Most of her scenes with Jim are pretty wooden.  We did get a ton of ""sulkily staring into the distance while mulling over dark thoughts"", especially in comparison to characters who were catapulted into insanity like Jonathan, or had an heart-breakingly funny progression like Ed. Barbara slowly cracked and shattered as she sank into depression/substance abuse, and - in comparison with the usual brand of crazy Gotham City provides - it's quite a bland plotline.  Erin was really given only two episodes that made her character stand out, and she did great in them. Also, Barbara is now in position to raise the worst kind of hell, which would give much better material for the actress in season 2.   I'm kind of worried about the ill will the character has gathered, however. Seems to me like the character is pretty much universally hated, and it's going to be a hard job to redeem it. I wonder if she'll be on past season 2."
Gotham,3d0ddn,metawohoo,5,Sun Jul 12 13:51:53 2015 UTC,"I think the ""How about now?"" line, brandishing the knife, redeemed her for a lot of folks (myself included.) My eyes damned near popped out of my head. Took me totally by surprise."
Gotham,3d0ddn,TrogdorLLC,2,Sun Jul 12 16:07:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah me too but it's an odd character to get behind anyway, think early in the season she should have had interests to follow, I heard she was an attorney or something  It would be great if she pursued some job like that and stirs things up in GCPD for Gordon then at night the claws come out and she has an alternate life"
Gotham,3d0ypn,EmperorJoker,12,Sun Jul 12 16:42:08 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the actors are being so careful to call him ""our joker-like character"" and ""proto-joker"" as well as ""possible joker"" so much that i'm convinced the audience is supposed to believe he's the joker only for him to be killed off or something. If he was the joker, they'd say joker. They dont say possible mad hatter or Mr Freeze. they just outright say it. I think this is all a trick."
Gotham,3d0ypn,GobbleMyPot,3,Sun Jul 12 16:49:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. Besides remember the trailer? ""This villain is no joke."""
Gotham,3d0ypn,msakit234,-10,Sun Jul 12 16:55:47 2015 UTC,Yes because the only thing that is a joke is this post
Gotham,3d0ypn,metawohoo,6,Sun Jul 12 17:25:50 2015 UTC,Party pooper. No cake for you.
Gotham,3d0ypn,TLTKroniX2,4,Sun Jul 12 17:31:07 2015 UTC,Imagine that with Bullocks voice

Gotham,3d0ypn,wotad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:51:51 2015 UTC,im not so sure i just hope Jerome has a good part i think hes amazing and he seems so like joker honestly
Gotham,3d0ypn,HonorForCorvo,10,Thu Jul 16 18:19:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm tired of everyone trying to crib the Joker's origin from The Killing Joke. It's a decent story, don't get me wrong, but it's not the end-all-and-be-all of Joker stories (and it's also aged pretty badly, IMO). So I think the Jerome story is OK for now. Besides, Gotham deviates from the source material in so many extreme ways (Maroni dead? Harvey Dent way older than Bruce? The Wayne family killed as a result of shady corporate shenanigans?), that this doesn't really matter much."
Gotham,3d0ypn,wotad,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:54:33 2015 UTC,they could just merge the characters? hes both leader of the red hood and joker?
Gotham,3d0ypn,vanzee,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:29:53 2015 UTC,Killing Joke retells his original origin.
Gotham,3d0ypn,insanity-insight,5,Sun Jul 12 21:19:07 2015 UTC,"The Killing Joke is an origin story told by the Joker, who is a roundly unreliable narrator.  I don't think it's a crazy reading of the Killing Joke to view it as a narrative the Joker himself made up, exaggerated or only partly remembers. That's why I'm totally cool with a show like Gotham not treating The Killing Joke as absolute 100% canon for Joker's origin."
Gotham,3d0ypn,vanzee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:05:15 2015 UTC,"Getting knocked into a vat of chemicals while dressed as the Red Hood comes from his original origin from the 1940s, an origin that has been retold many times (including in The Killing Joke)."
Gotham,3d0ypn,AlwaysBeBatman,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:53:28 2015 UTC,"Not that part. The. Rest. Of. It.  The ONLY evidence in favor of any of the ""mild mannered comedian who had one bad day"" stuff is Joker telling a story. One time. Which he prefaces with comments about ""preferring his past multiple choice.""  The backstory in Killing Joke ain't gospel."
Gotham,3d0ypn,Kumquatodor,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:17 2015 UTC,"And think about how the story starts: Joker alone in a bar, when two guys approach him...  Three guys walk into a bar."
Gotham,3d0ypn,AlwaysBeBatman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:53:19 2015 UTC,Ha! The whole sob story is a joke set-up! Never looked at it that way!
Gotham,3d0ypn,Kumquatodor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:02:53 2015 UTC,"It was so perfectly integrated, I would normally assume it was an accident on the writer's part...  Then I remembered that the author was Alan Moore. Say what you will about him, he's genius enough to come up with that joke."
Gotham,3d0ypn,wotad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:17:56 2015 UTC,he could just be both the leader of the red hoods and the joker
