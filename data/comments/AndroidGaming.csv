Found it stacked on one of the end shelfs with the (typically) horrible low end games, maybe a year or two after it came out.  Ended up being one of my favorites.  Fantastic story and superb cast.  Im not that crazy about the pricing system they have, but I have some Google Opinion rewards to spend something on and this could be what Im looking for."

AndroidGaming,3e2exi,_sadme_,2,Tue Jul 21 14:15:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah the blue cog are jobs, I avoided to give the building names because I just want them to be Icons and display there functionallity by a picture and not a name. I do know that you hit a wall pretty quickly and I'm really concerned about this, but I have to come up with an idea because I like the late game and how it works, and changing numbers in the early game would be too crucial for the end part.

AndroidGaming,3e2exi,vic242212,2,Tue Jul 21 15:24:25 2015 UTC,"The game looks very promising!   The tutorial is not as bad as you think, but switching from one screen to another looks very unnatural. Please, add some animations or fading in/out.  It's really hard to see whether I'm in ""zooming"" or ""building"" mode - a border around a button at the bottom is not not enough. Maybe the city's empty tiles should change colour when I'm in ""building"" mode? Demolish, zoom out and tutorial buttons look like flat images and they give no visual feedback when they're pressed. They should at least invert their colours when I keep my finger on them.   Anyway, I'm really looking forward for the new version!"
AndroidGaming,3e2exi,vic242212,2,Tue Jul 21 14:48:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the really contstructive feedback! Improving the buttons is a really important issue, that I should've come up with by myself. And you're right, the tutorial screen just splashes up, doesn't look good. I'll try implement a fading screen and update it. For the difference between ""building"" and ""zooming"" mode. Changing empty tiles would kind of look weird I would imagine. In the later game you frequently change between building and zooming, I don't know if a huge visual change between these  2states would be rather annoying?"

I've started the game twice now and lost all progress both times."
AndroidGaming,3e2exi,lukazaz,2,Tue Jul 21 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"Okay this error is new to me. What phone are you using? It's programmed in a way, that everytime you close the game (the back key for a samsung phone) it saves your building pattern and the numbers. When you start the game, do you still have to go through the tutorial again?"
AndroidGaming,3e2exi,lukazaz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:09 2015 UTC,I'm using Galaxy S5. Does it only save with the back button? I usually use the home button to close out of apps. And no it doesn't show the tutorial again (I'm on the second stage)
AndroidGaming,3e2exi,RebelBinary,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:53 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, the phones I tested could only end the game by pressing back. I should add a ""home"" button trigger then? And swiping the menu should be easier with the next update."

It's trivial for a script to find an optimal Scrabble solution, but the entire point of it as a human is to test your vocabulary. I'm sure Tetris could be easily 'solved' by a script as well.

I'm sure Tetris could be easily 'solved' by a script as well.    I'm not sure, Scrabble might be pretty difficult to solve for, since there are a lot of scoring variables and the code would need a database and to maintain a full layout of the board during play to calculate the highest score. An app that finds the best score for your current letters isn't the same thing as solving the game.  Scrabble also has random elements in the letter grabbing, so unlike something like chess or go, it's not an entirely static setup, and maintains complexity as the game proceeds (whereas in something like chess, complexity decreases over time). I do enjoy Scrabble though, fun game to play with my spouse, and I do love wordplay.  I'd agree Tetris could be coded for best case solutions. Might even be fun to try. But I don't really enjoy Tetris, so I'd actually be happy to solve that with a script.   Tetris has little actual complexity, and it's easily manageable as a puzzle game. The only difficulty comes in reflex speed, until eventually the game becomes too fast to be humanly solvable. To me that doesn't demonstrate a good puzzle, despite Tetris' enduring qualities. Adding reflex to a puzzle game is fine, but forcing the game to end by speeding up until it becomes literally impossible... that's boring. There's an automatic human hard limit on success there."
AndroidGaming,3e27b3,AtomicSlothCreature,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:29 2015 UTC,"Talking about puzzles or puzzle games is different to just 'games' generally, which is what you said originally. I'd argue that an app finding the highest possible score with your current letters is sufficiently 'solving' the game (in the context of the OP and what we're actually talking about here anyway.) If you mean finding the optimal possible layout of all possible tiles on the board to ensure maximum score for everybody, sure that'd be more complicated."

AndroidGaming,3dxyio,pupunoob,5,Mon Jul 20 15:34:40 2015 UTC,I'm from Malaysia and all assignments and exam answers are written in a long drawn out way with lots of fluff here. Its fucking stupid.
AndroidGaming,3dxyio,TheRealKidkudi,3,Tue Jul 21 08:10:43 2015 UTC,"I remember one time in either 7th or 8th grade (in the US), our teacher assigned us to write an 8 page essay on To Kill a Mockingbird. Of course, we were middle schoolers - he might as well have told us to write a novel. When it was due, we all turned in essays that were basically 2 pages fluffed up to 8 pages and he was so mad. He drilled into us how to be concise.  By the time I got to high school, our teachers knew what was fluff and what wasn't and they would shit all over you if you fluffed up an answer just to make it longer. For certain assignments, one of my teachers actually made a length limit."
AndroidGaming,3dxyio,pupunoob,2,Tue Jul 21 11:04:55 2015 UTC,I found over the years that writing short and concise while still being interesting is way more difficult. That's just me though.

AndroidGaming,3dxyio,HephaestusXIII,-2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:38 2015 UTC,"When it comes to mobile games, a couple of things are on a lot of people's minds: Ads and In-App Purchases. Crossy Road has both of these things. However, Crossy Road (at least on Android), does not feature ads during regular gameplay. The player has the option to view these ads to get a special 20 coin reward. This is a great way to have ads in your game. They don't obstruct your view and give you something special for helping out the developer.  In-App Purchases have a different take in Crossy Road. You have the option to buy characters instead of taking your chances in the prize machine. Some characters can only be unlocked by doing certain things with certain characters but most characters can be bought for a low price. At certain points in the game, it will ask if you want to purchase a certain character and if you purchase it at the time, you get a coin bonus.   Sure this is a good system but why are you acting as if Crossy Road is the pioneer of it? Games have been doing this for years now."

AndroidGaming,3dz2dm,NotADamsel,6,Mon Jul 20 18:26:00 2015 UTC,The Metal Slugs....I've purchased the original and if you have a high res screen then the touch controls cover the entire screen. They are pretty much unplayable unless they have updated them especially for here. No word on that yet.   The fighters work well with a bluetooth controller. I know that Garou can use 2 bluetooth controllers. Not sure about the others.

Garou Mark of the Wolves: it's actually easier to play this game with touch controls rather than with a controller. They added 2 new buttons that do the special attacks and super attacks with a swipe. I was actually struggling to do special attacks with my BT gamepad but it's a breeze with touch. The d-pad seems to respond well to backhops but I can't seem to do forward lunges well.   I'll try out the others and update this post."
AndroidGaming,3dz2dm,morphinedreams,2,Tue Jul 21 02:43:22 2015 UTC,Doesn't seem worth it to pay over average when they cost 99 cents each in the play store anyway.. Just buy the one or two that you want.
AndroidGaming,3dz2dm,morphinedreams,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:17:55 2015 UTC,true. But it also depends what is offered next week as well. Probably KOF '98 or KOF 2012. Either that or Beast Busters or or one of the unreleased ones which are due out. Athena Asamiya or Monster King.  Monster King will probably be a reboot of King of Monsters https://youtu.be/lgoU7Y5a6Yg?t=18s  Not sure about the other.  But keep an eye out.

AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,rbwrath,3,Mon Jul 20 07:45:51 2015 UTC,"Thank you.  I do want to polish the game up a little now.   I went with the philosophy of focusing on good solid gameplay, but I found that without adequate polish, some people don't give the game a chance.   I'm going to look into putting in a new font tomorrow along with taking some screenshots of interesting places."

It is worse than 'judging a book by its cover'  - - many of your target demo don't even read...   Focusing on gameplay is important but if they don't give more than a glance,  they will never experience it."
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,djhamilton,2,Mon Jul 20 12:27:57 2015 UTC,"I will give this game ago, based on your post, details, and effort over the years.  You are correct on the polishing, and very right about people not giving them game a chance.  I am one of these suckers who judge the book by the cover, And i think thats adapted over the years of trying to filter through utter junk on the store.   Polished Icons, graphics / tiles, Fonts, Sounds etc  (Removing the sharp edges and rounding them make all the difference) Video of ingame footage is a good selling point for me (Too many trails of NONE ingame footage)   This is no direct criticism, i am writing this as your game is downloading.  This is just a few of the things i notice while browsing games these days,   Also am very reluctant to install Free games any-more.  Two reason:  My parents always told me nothing in life is for free (Am 28) <- Wise words There will be Add or a horrible form of IAP purchases along the way or if neother of these, It will Hijack my notification bar adding stupid content in there.

Your parents aren't all knowing. There's lots of free good stuff out there, and there's something called open source software.  Even if it's not for android, Dwarf fortress is the biggest example.

AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,Graverobber2,9,Mon Jul 20 11:57:41 2015 UTC,"@ /u/goodnewsjimdotcom, please do this.  This is probably one of the biggest problems you have on the store page itself: the graphic styles are not consistent. Characters and monsters have completely different art styles, which makes it look like your game was thrown together from some loose asset, despite how much time you may have invested in it.  You don't need AAA-grade graphics, just make your art style consistent.  I'll play through this for a bit when I get home and post some feedback."
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,thenewshaft,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:44 2015 UTC,Great advice
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,BGzC1utch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:47:33 2015 UTC,The thing with those tools is they are very generic and have little customization. I have bought some of those tools on Steam and have regretted buying them. There is a little customization you can do too it but not enough to make it your own.
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,NotADamsel,4,Mon Jul 20 20:03:41 2015 UTC,"Sure, most of those tools are shit, I won't disagree. That's not why anyone should buy the pack, now matter how much the folks on the site want to flaunt them. For a competent developer (like OP seems to be) it's 12 bucks for a bunch of good assets and the Spriter program. That's still pretty good value!"
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,Skywise87,9,Mon Jul 20 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are really passionate about what you made and that you worked really hard on it.  However in my experience game developers do not make great marketers.  Maybe find a friend more business inclined to help you write your blurb/description?  It's kind of rambly and unfocused being that its sort of a list of reasons why you like your own game.  Im not saying your game is bad at all, I just think you might benefit from a better presentation."

AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,Graverobber2,6,Mon Jul 20 09:25:46 2015 UTC,"It's mostly because the art style is inconsistent. Makes it look like some cheap crap thrown together in a few minutes.  As I said above, you don't need AAA-grade graphics, just make your art style consistent. That alone will be a big improvement and will stop scaring people away."
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,jb611,19,Mon Jul 20 15:03:22 2015 UTC,Can't open because it requires Adobe Air. Screenshots are not compelling me to jump through the necessary hoops. Good luck.
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,zworp,11,Mon Jul 20 03:23:42 2015 UTC,Thank you for honest feedback.
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,zworp,7,Mon Jul 20 03:30:23 2015 UTC,There's a setting when you build your Air app to include the Air runtime with the game so people dont need to download it seperatly. (Also it's a bit more safe in case Adobe removes Air or updates it to be incompatible with your game)
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,NotADamsel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:32:40 2015 UTC,"You think I should go that road?   I opted to allow Air to be separate in case people have several adobe AIR applications.   If someone owns several AIR applications, and each imbedded AIR, it would take more space on the phone.   Also I don't think Adobe would update AIR to be incompatible because it keeps legacy versions inside its latest version.  If I should chain my app together with Air, let me know.  I don't know the standard methods on this."
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,hamspiced,5,Mon Jul 20 11:36:46 2015 UTC,"I haven't done anything with Air in years, so I don't know for sure. But I think it's worth the extra size to not have to make the players download something extra. I'm pretty sure that's how most developers do it."
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,shsourov,2,Mon Jul 20 11:59:05 2015 UTC,"If you're going to stick with Air, then definitely bundle it. It's a mark against your game to require us to download it, and the people with air already won't realize it either way."
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,Graverobber2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:04:14 2015 UTC,Thank you.  I'll do that now.
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,zoopz,3,Mon Jul 20 22:34:55 2015 UTC,"Ill be honest.   I downloaded your game.  The installation failed.   I removed two other games to install yours.   Once it installed i tried to run it for the first time it said i needed the AIR runtime.   At that point i said Eff it.  Uninstalled your game without playing it.  If it were bundled it may still be on the device.  But personally i wont play games that require a third party app to play. Ill give it another go though.  seems the comments are positive enough to try.  Otherwise coming from a power user, too many steps increase frustration enough to not bother for me."
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,Roman_Reddit,4,Mon Jul 20 21:19:58 2015 UTC,adobe air is really light weight. and you'll need it for some other games too. you should install it I think
AndroidGaming,3dwj3v,HumanTarget,15,Mon Jul 20 04:20:38 2015 UTC,"to be fair, games shouldn't require other apps to be playable (emulator don't count, since they where meant for another platform).  you're completely dependent on the other guy keeping his app up to date and not pulling it from the store (which adobe already did with flash)"

If you can put up with this, then it's a fun distraction. I didn't find the writing quality to be comparable to that of a good book, but... it's a dollar. It entertained me for a few minutes and that was worth the price I paid. Certainly not a life-changing experience and far from ""best game ever"", but I've spent more money on worse."

AndroidGaming,3dv6gk,fusedotcore,2,Sun Jul 19 20:40:15 2015 UTC,"I'd do it. It was a cool and unique experience. I will say, though, there isn't much replay value. Yeah there are different endings and a few different things can happen based on your decisions, but many of the different outcomes from earlier in the story have no effect at all on the ending, and some seem like they could have significant effects later on but are not mentioned again. Most of the differences are quite minor. The real challenge is just staying alive. I started my second play through and did things differently and i didn't see much difference. Ended up googling alternate endings and uninstalling, but it was a really good game for a buck and I'd say go for it."

I play a lot of choose your own adventure style games, and one of the mayor appeals to me is that I can explore all the different ways until I succeed. But I finished this on the first try. Maybe I was lucky, maybe that's just how it is supposed to be, but I don't feel the urge to replay an extremely short storybased adventure which I know the ending of.   I would say if you want good games of this style go with 80 days or the sorcery series. They are MUCH longer and great games with awesome stories."

AndroidGaming,3dv6gk,TheBrokenMan,4,Sun Jul 19 20:19:34 2015 UTC,"Spoiler  The game seemed kind of cool at first, but the interactions with Taylor seemed more and more... bleh. I mean the narrative conceit is that your her one outside contact, but the fact that you could actively come after her isn't even addressed, and you make decisions like you're in her shoes--she does pretty much exactly what you tell her... and she freaking TYPES to you as she's running or in peril of her life, etc... which is stupid. And somehow there's no time lag between transmission and reception.  And in the end the mystery is kind of lame. Like a made for TV level sci-fi plot device. No real sense of wonder, and any gravity is sort of ruined by her flippant sarcasm."

AndroidGaming,3dxbmi,Venomousvillainy,3,Mon Jul 20 08:40:28 2015 UTC,"I have the process automated using Dropbox and an Android app called DropSync. The app will let you specify a folder on your Android device and sync its contents with a folder on a Dropbox (Paid or free) account. The free version of DropSync supports a single folder. I ended up getting the Pro key to sync multiple folders. This allows me to manage the books and media on my tablet using my dropbox account.  Here's what I do:   Sync the following folder on my tablet to a folder on Dropbox: /storage/emulated/0/Android/data/com.aspyr.swkotor/files/saves Include that folder in the ones synced to my mac. Create a symlink on my mac to link the synced Dropbox folder to the corresponding folder on my Mac copy of KNOTOR.    From there, everything is automated. My Android gameplay is synced to my Dropbox account by DropSync and the Dropbox client on my Mac takes care of syncing between Dropbox and my desktop. If I were to play on one device before the changes from the other had synced up, I'd have conflicts and possible corrupt files, but it's pretty easy to view the sync status of Dropbox and Dropsync.  I even use this trick to use a Windows emulator on my Mac to run a save game editor. I use a shared folder between the guest Windows box and the host Mac to edit the Mac's save files. Dropbox syncs the new save game files to Dropbox and Dropsync syncs them to my Android tablet.  All of this should work just fine without a Mac, as long as your Windows version is one that supports symbolic links.  Linkme : Dropsync (Dropbox Autosync)"

Any Creo that is given to you, from a farm for instance, can easily be 7 star and is possible to save prior to getting them to reset for a higher star version.  Also, and not sure if just anncedontal, but I've had better luck with higher star Creos from the ones you can see rather than random encounters. Each area always has some Creos walking around and they do change from time to time."

Years and years ago my favorite game ever was a mac only platform and i haveyet to find a game as similar in design to it.   While VERY similar to master of Orion It was part space RPG part action adventure.  It was called: Escape Velocity you can pick up a great trial of it, but this style game is something ive yet to see on the android market, and it could easily be accomplished.  Link for game The other idea is not so much a game, but like something soely to increase the ""gamerscore"" playstore points.   I dont know how Android allows you to input challenges, but i was wondering why there isnt a ""game"" out there just to severely inflate the gamerscores.  And if you, as a dev are concerned with IAP like it seems alot of Dev's are you can create different IAP's to increase the gamerscore multipliers.  MY idea for a game that culd be liek this is similar to the old flash based game Upgrade Complete Or even build the metric into one of your current game ideas just build in one of the odd features that it completely bunks the Playstore game-score metrics.  And just over inflates it by a mass amount.   Like you can get a playscore from 1 - 20 in just one playthrough..."

The screen quality is miserable, the speed is terrible. They'd hard crash running Temple Run, and I had one that wouldn't reboot even if you held the power button in- to reboot it you had to let the battery drain to nothing and turn itself off.   The screen being as bad as it is meant that even the slightest bump would crack the LCD, and the thin-ness of the tablet meant that if you shifted the weight in your hand even a little, the LCD would ripple like you were pressing on it."

I only really use it to play Hearthstone and some other games. Minecraft runs flawlessly with ""fancy graphics"" enabled and max render distance.

AndroidGaming,3dq4xb,Graverobber2,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:57:18 2015 UTC,"Both are very good, but they are completely different types of games.  Sproggiwood is a really typical roguelike: Turnbased combat, where you and your opponents move and attack at the same time.  TWoM is a survival story where you have to manage the mental and physical health of the people in a building. You have to go out at night and scavenge to improve your hideout. It's no so much a fun game, as it is an engaging game, as the game gives you a lot of hard decisions (i.e. do I rob this old couple, just so my survivers can live,...)"

I don't want to say too much so I don't spoil anything, but it's one of the few Android games that I found to be well done story wise.  With that, I'm sort of in OP's situation where I'm looking for good text based games beyond Lifeline."
AndroidGaming,3dpbba,Inaudible1,4,Sat Jul 18 07:43:04 2015 UTC,"IMO, idk if anyone else feels this way but, the writing in Lifeline was too simplistic and the character came off as too ""dumb"", for lack of a better word.  However, this was my first text-based phone game, as it probably is for most people but the dialogue could have been better. SPOILER"

For me, it was a good game in a sea of pay to win turds (maybe I'm just looking at the wrong types of games to play).  I bought it for a dollar when it was on sale about a week ago so I say I definitely got my money's worth."

AndroidGaming,3dofjj,PlayStoreLinks__Bot,2,Mon Jul 20 05:51:57 2015 UTC,"It's called a spot shadow. It's a projected texture, not screen-space ambient occlusion.

You use a limited supply of credits to buy units (tanks, rocket-launching robots, etc), plan a route to your destination, then go. Here's a gameplay video that IGN did (not sure if it's the PC or mobile version).  If you don't like it you can refund the purchases up to 30 minutes (don't quote me on that though) after you buy them. Time enough to download and test them out (be aware that they are on the large size, Anomaly 2 was 1.8GB for me).

I'm a serial messer-of-devices and wipe and flash regularly. And it seems every time I want to play ""The Impossible Game"" it won't let me because I have no signal for it to check licence servers.  A much better implementation would be a nag screen every couple of games that says something like ""It looks like you're enjoying our game but we can't verify that you've paid for it. Please consider buying it.""  I've seen a post somewhere about a dev that did this and it just seems a far less draconian way of doing it.

I quite enjoyed the game, the missions themselves play a bit like XCOM except that the abilities and weapons your character has available at any time are determined by what cards you've drawn from your deck and how you've built said deck.   I never reached a point where I found my progress hampered by not having paid anything. I did constantly feel like I didn't have enough currency to do everything that I wanted to do but I took that in my stride and played it like XCOM where I was making choices for what I wanted to do.

AndroidGaming,3dociv,Ryvaeus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:19:12 2015 UTC,"The closest I can think of is Emulating Populous. Either for the SNES or the Nintendo DS. I still remember emulating Populous on my symbian phone so it shouldn't be that big of a problem. In case you're wondering, Populous is a game about beating the fuckin' ugly reds with your army of smurf people by sculpting landscapes to give way for your blue people to build a civilization and using the divine energy accumulated to overthrow the red people through the power of the gods.  The SNES version has a lot of game features right off the bat, including a ""Custom"" mode where you can play the game your way on over 900 computer generated maps with your own choice of tileset and Handicap. Problem is that variety is lacking outside being able to pick your own terrain and setting what either you or your enemy can cast (Your choice of tileset actually affects both growth rate and health...a grass tileset takes time to birth new followers but they're harder to kill while a desert tileset offers the opposite).  The DS version is technically and mechanically superior in content (Which is a mix between the best parts of Populous 1's free play Sandbox mode and Populous 2's multiple deities), but being a dual screen touchscreen game its also clunkier. The game has more features like the aformentioned multiple deities who have their own unique set of God Powers and worshiper attributes and the return of the first game's multiple tilesets but most of them need to be unlocked. But I don't think that's big of a problem since I'm not that good at the game anyway and mastering the ropes should make it more fun...at least imo.

AndroidGaming,3dlk7p,worstchristmasever,2,Fri Jul 17 12:54:49 2015 UTC,I find controlls in this Easter egg to be less precise than in floppy bird.
AndroidGaming,3dlk7p,ColdSkalpel,3,Fri Jul 17 14:28:46 2015 UTC,It's actually more precise (and less forgiving) than Flappy Bird thus causing the huge ramp up in difficulty. I did not do well in this game at all until I realized that the droid's bounces are directly proportional to your touch on the screen. Light taps are the way to go.

And if you're cool with a roguelike that has a sidescrolling twist, there's WazHack.  Ananias has an interface designed specifically for mobile, it needs very few screenpresses, and it is by no means casual, though a bit oddly done.  And lastly, while it is certainly very approachable for casuals, I would recommend Hoplite.  Linkme: HyperRogue, WazHack, Ananias Roguelike, Hoplite  P.S. You get used to the OSK, especially in DCSS, trust me. It's got all the right commands already on it and it's not even intrusive."

I guess I basically just want a DCSS that looks and plays like Ananias, or for ToME to hurry up with its Android port.  Ananias and Wazhack are probably my favourite mobile roguelikes, and they're probably the closest I'll get to what I'm looking for at the moment. I'm just kind of over the typical ""roguelike"" on mobile. I love DCSS's depth, and absurd amount of races and classes.

For me, stand outs include Republique (fantastic rogue like puzzle game with console quality graphics), the bard's tale ( award winning diablo style rpg that will having you laughing from start to end), anomaly (console graphics tower defense spin off game where you play as the invaders ), and maybe Implosion (just came out. Diablo style, short missions, great graphics and touch controls). As for arcade, I highly recommend sky force. Oh, and if you are into MOBAs, you absolutely MUST try Vainglory (award winning iOS title with smooth 60fps, Dota 2/LoL quality graphics and 20ms server response time ported to android a few weeks ago.

For action RPGs, even if they are not Diablo like you have something like (and so much more, those are just 3 great games):   The 3rd Birthday God of War Monster Hunter   Not to mention games like GTA Vice City/Liberty City stories, Loco Roco, Patapon and a shit ton of other exlusives.

If you want something retro try Deadly Dungeons, Questlord or Delver (this one is pretty cool, it's like a first person hack n slash/dungeon crawler/roguelike/fps, without any iaps)  Block Story is a Minecraft+rpg fusion, there's a free version available, you can check it out before buying the paid version.  Also playing Terraria multiplayer is really simple, you pretty much need 2 or more devices connected to the same wifi network.

AndroidGaming,3dhv5z,Lurkndog,6,Thu Jul 16 14:24:41 2015 UTC,"There certainly are several android device forks/ports of various C64 and Amiga emulators already available.   However, the C64 and Amiga were full home computers, with keyboards, joy sticks/pads and mice, and software for them tends to use keyboard extensively (well, there were some fairly unsuccessful games-console variants of both like the C64GS and Amiga CD32). So they can be kind of frustrating to use on small mobile/android devices beyond some of the more basic and slow moving games, even more so than typical pure games-console emulators like NES/SNES (which ""just"" have the usual ""touchscreen virtual joypads suuuuuck"" issue).    While the necessary ROM/OS images are not exactly hard to track down, Amiga Forever is an official (i.e. fully licensed, including relevant ROM and Disk OS images) Amiga emulator package setup for easy use on current platforms from Cloanto (well-known in the Amiga era as developers of Personal Paint), lately including a setup intended for use with existing android Amiga emulators.

I'd say one of the less worse (still pretty bad) of those I met was DomiNations. A lot of waiting for buildings to get ready, but the troop building is faster and even on the worst raid you are bound to get enough food to rebuild any loss you had in the army. You surely can't sit and play, but I once spent a day or two battling a new city every 1-5 minutes depending on how disastrous my attack was."

AndroidGaming,3dk2c8,Grossmond,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:42:30 2015 UTC,Is there an option for more builders? Thats a really cool option in CoC
AndroidGaming,3dk2c8,SyntheticEmerald,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:44:59 2015 UTC,"No.  The individual build times are much shorter.  If you look at the end-game build times (which are the easiest to compare,) Boom Beach construction times are roughly 5x quicker than Clash.  Its kind of like the game coming with five builders at the start.  Not only are upgrades more gratifying when they're done in hours (and at endgame, a day or two,) you're not stuck without something critical long periods of time.  cough archer queen with 25 levels of upgrades that take a week each cough  Its also easier to maximize your builders' time usage.  Instead of trying to stagger upgrades of varying lengths so they don't all end at the same time, you have one project with simple time math.  eg. You start a project at 10am, it takes 6 hours, and you should log on some time around 4pm to start your next project.  Before my Clash base was maxed, I had upgrades on my fucking calendar so I could be sure not to run into issues using all five builders."

The advertising method looks interesting but I have a clarification question. For the pay scale are you considering clicking the ad to go to the listing within curated as the click pay scale or is it clicking to go to the play store?
AndroidGaming,3di08m,AmberVaid,2,Thu Jul 16 18:24:28 2015 UTC,"Yeahp - I've been thinking about including apps in Curated.  Still not 100% on it.  But I do have plans for another app that will include all categories and will be entirely community driven.    The click counts for going to the Curated page.  In theory, it should be pretty much the same - since the Curated listing is the same as the Play Store listing, but with extra information.  If someone actually wants to install the app, they'll probably be willing to click the install button twice (once in Curated & once in Google Play).  And it doesn't disrupt the user experience by opening the Play Store app."

I signed up for the beta and was granted access hours later. It's a lot of fun, although the skill curve is rather steep, or rather it's just hard to see what's going on in fights at times. You're given some heroes, although you unlock the rest League-style. IAPs are disabled for now, but the only thing you seem to be able to do with IAPs, you can do with actual in-game currency."

AndroidGaming,3dlqv9,HarrisL2,8,Fri Jul 17 08:11:13 2015 UTC,"This game needs a better tutorial system.   they are not using a real language afaik, and while progressing the story mode, it is not explaining what is working how exactly. There is a documentation but having a step by step (better) tutorial will be better imo.   Other then that this game is great!"
AndroidGaming,3dlqv9,kallshak,2,Fri Jul 17 10:51:19 2015 UTC,"This game has frustrated me. The limitations on the tools available to you are just silly at times. It's not a coding app, it's a logic puzzle app. Half the puzzles I've done could have been more cleanly, quickly, and easily solved if only necessary language tools were available at any given time. I'm talking simple programming 101 stuff like multiplication, pow(), and modulo. Heck, as far as I can tell the game doesn't have a modulus, I'm not even entirely sure how integer division is handled in the game, I'd need to screw around a bit and check whether it's rounding to nearest, upper, or lower. Pretty sure doubles/floats aren't addressed, everything's been integer so far."
AndroidGaming,3dlqv9,tomkatt,2,Fri Jul 17 13:43:43 2015 UTC,"First you have to solve thing without multiplication and pow() then you will get those options, why would you deserve the shorter path if you can't even walk the long path? (That doesn't make sense I know) But you do get it later."
AndroidGaming,3dlqv9,tomkatt,0,Fri Jul 17 14:00:47 2015 UTC,"No, I get that. It's just pretty stupid at times. At one point I had to multiply values by a specific amount (basically input squared). Instead of being able to do pow(input, 2) or even input = input * input, I was forced to use two placeholder values. One as a counter, and one additive so I could iteratively loop over the value of input and do var_b = var_b + input (and on that note, why no += functionality?). I was literally locked out of basic mathmatical functions like multiplication and division. It was really, really stupid to have to do it that way. Not to mention if this thing is supposedly some advanced hackpad from the future or whatever... well, it's pretty damned crippled for what it needs to do.  But you're making my point to a degree.    why would you deserve the shorter path if you can't even walk the long path?   Exactly why I say it's logic puzzles, and not a coding app. I have to solve a puzzle, not write code."
AndroidGaming,3dlqv9,tomkatt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:03:20 2015 UTC,"I know what you're saying, but that is EXACTLY the point! After that level you got to do it with pow() again!  Fault of the sub! It was a typo, but I couldn't edit it!"

However, keep in mind that where I live we don't have that much of a consumerism culture, and not everyone has a high-end cellphone.  If you are a developer, i think that (sadly for me) you'll be better off aiming for a more ""online play"" market if you have multiplayer.

AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,BowsersaurusRex,3,Thu Jul 16 20:23:28 2015 UTC,"As the meme goes, that's not how any of this works.  Atari v. North American Philips (1982) establishes a general ""look and feel"" requirement:   Although not ""virtually identical"" to PAC-MAN, K. C. Munchkin captures the ""total concept and feel"" of and is substantially similar to PAC-MAN.   This isn't a case where the features are essentially required by the idea itself, like the two karate games in Data East v. Epyx (1988)    [W]e find that [the games' features] necessarily follow from the idea of a martial arts karate combat game, or are inseparable from, indispensable to, or even standard treatment of the idea of the karate sport. As such, they are not protectable.   Superman and Captain Marvel weren't exact clones, but that didn't stop the court finding in favor of Supes in National v. Fawcett, too.  The idea of raising creatures to fight one another isn't as restrictive as karate, so I'd argue we're closer to the Atari case than anything.  I'm not bashing the game - I like that they made it, after all - but I'd reckon a C&D would head the developers' way should they get too big for the rights holders not to notice."

AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,houseofbacon,10,Thu Jul 16 00:04:53 2015 UTC,"From my knowledge, it's mostly costume items for your character or monster and not anything vital for you to play the game."
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,Coppermcpick,7,Wed Jul 15 14:26:49 2015 UTC,"Oh good, I saw like 58 bucks and I was like holy crap"
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,houseofbacon,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:33:39 2015 UTC,"I bought the game, basically you can buy gems which will let you buy costumes, a random lvl.5 creo with a 7+ rarity, and a item that makes creos not appear in areas you've cleared."

AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,antonyourkeyboard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:20:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed; this and the fact that their 'website' (linked on the Play Store page) is just an 'under construction' page (2005 called, they want their web design for dummies book back), I got very worried, especially on top of the IAPs behind a paywall.  Although to be perfectly honest, I still kinda am."
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,TinynDP,2,Thu Jul 16 20:26:53 2015 UTC,This game was developed by just a few people in total. When I backed it on kickstarter almost 2 years ago the creator was a student in Boulder so I am incredibly impressed with what has been accomplished. Definitely needs Android TV and controller support though.

AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,Ag3ntDeZa,22,Wed Jul 15 22:35:22 2015 UTC,"MINI REVIEW First, this has Google Cloud save. Try the free version, if you like it, spend the dollar. Your data will transfer over    Yes, this game is a LOT like Pokemon but does have some places it stands out. Based on the tutorials, several Creos evolve based on affinity towards a particular element. This is tracked on the status screen and can be manipulated. Your starter is one such Creo. Status conditions are fairly powerful (so far) and can stack/worsen. For example, you can burn an opponent twice and they take more damage. Neat little mechanic.    Loading times are crap. Starting up the game takes a fair amount of time. Battles take several seconds to load, much like FF7. Quite surprising based on the average graphics.    IAP Yes, this has IAP. It is a premium currency you can purchase to summon Creos and Shiny Creos (Gatcha style), item to avoid encounters in previous areas, and Avatars. Buying the full version gets you 400 premium currency, which is enough for one shiny summon. I assume Avatars are unique to IAP, but I don't know about the summons. I'm not far enough in to know yet.    However, this game is certainly worth a dollar right now."
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,dannubs_,2,Thu Jul 16 02:35:09 2015 UTC,"FYI, you get far more than 400 Premium early on. Explore the towns. :)  Already got two Alt Creo by the time I went to the first city."

AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,dannubs_,3,Thu Jul 16 20:20:01 2015 UTC,"It does. I haven't played with multiplayer very much yet. Spent yesterday exploring the first few cities. That's on today's agenda. With just a quick peek into it, trading works like Pokemon direct trading. You need to have someone's name in order to trade. I would have preferred something like the Global Trade Station in DPP instead."

AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,zekkas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:30:09 2015 UTC,Does playing without buying premium currency feel like a grind? Can you get premium currency without spending money? Can you get shiny Creos without buying them?
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,Rygdea,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:33:31 2015 UTC,"Not really. There's plenty of experience to go around, and my starter has carried me well enough so far. You get another high rank Creo after beating the first arena to help round out your team. And to further reduce the grindy nature of this type of games, you can re-battle the arena (gym) to gain quick experience. Don't waste your time leveling against wild Creo."

AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,mrfluffleupagus,5,Wed Jul 15 16:25:54 2015 UTC,hows the game? it looks pretty interesting and seeing how theres gonna be more updates for it
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,intellos,5,Thu Jul 16 03:48:46 2015 UTC,"It plays pretty much like any of the Pokémon games.  It has arenas, trainers, and an evil enemy like Team Rocket.  Different monsters evolve and you work your way to the top of the coliseum.  Also, there's multiplayer trainer battles/trades."
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,mrfluffleupagus,12,Wed Jul 15 16:08:16 2015 UTC,"It's worth pointing out though that the mechanics are actually quite different for battles.  Instead of being lazy and making a direct copy of Pokemon's system they created their own, it's actually a bit more complicated too."
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,intellos,5,Wed Jul 15 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"more complicated too.   Holy shit, how has it not collapsed into a singularity of mechanics?  Then again, Dota 2 exists..."
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,mrfluffleupagus,3,Wed Jul 15 16:36:57 2015 UTC,"It's nothing overwhelming (IMO) but it's got some interesting choices.  You have affinity to the types for example, which builds as you use abilities of those types. So a creo will do better with skills of the type its built affinity to.  Also instead of PP some skills have different amounts cooldowns so that they can't be spammed and you're forced to use more strategy later on, and effects stack... you can be inflicted with multiple at once and repeated use does things like raise duration."
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,Elephaux,8,Wed Jul 15 16:46:12 2015 UTC,"You have affinity to the types for example, which builds as you use abilities of those types. So a creo will do better with skills of the type its built affinity to.   If I understand correctly, this sounds exactly like Pokemon's STAB.  That's interesting about multiple + stacking statuses... also fucking terrifying if they are anywhere near as effective as they are in Pokemon.  Really the thing that bothers me the most about Pokemon's battle system isn't necessarily the complexity, it's the fact that the majority of the mechanics are completely hidden. Take the STAB example; In the pokemon games I have played it existed, but there was nothing in game that let you know that they did. Often times you will only recieve the tiniest hint that there are hidden underlying mechanics, like when they introduced the Hairdresser in Silver, and trainers talked about how ""Happier pokemon seem to grow stronger!"". That was the ONLY information the game gave you about EV's, which are the second most important growth state in the game."
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,Gabe_b,3,Wed Jul 15 17:01:36 2015 UTC,"Not exactly but very similar yes. The biggest differences in it and stab that I've found so far are that a) it's directly influenced by your choices unlike static stabs from typings and b) it can actually affect what your creo evolves into (kind of like Eevee). The fact that it's up to you makes builds pretty flexible from what I've gathered so far.  Statuses are just as terrifying if not worse, some (maybe all) actually have different levels too.. like a burn can be a bad burn, which is basically just even more potent. I'm not sure if the levels are a typing thing or just RNG yet though.  and yeah, that always kind of annoyed me too. EvoCreo seems pretty transparent in its mechanics, I'm not incredibly far into it yet but it lays most things out in easy to understand ways even has a built in help that's actually fairly helpful. :P"
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,intellos,2,Wed Jul 15 17:55:07 2015 UTC,"""fucking terrifying"" is a little bit of a stretch, no?"
AndroidGaming,3ddsr4,Gabe_b,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:17:54 2015 UTC,"Feel like I may be missing a joke, but pokemon always seemed to have the most simplistic jrpg combat of any major franchise. Granted I never played against other humans, just the campaigns."

If you have problem with the loading message box after pressing ""Sign in"" button, you can close it with the back button (the android one, not the top ""in game"" one).

AndroidGaming,3dfq9v,vangogh11,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:47:41 2015 UTC,"Assuming that Google doesn't take payment to get featured, which i think seems reasonable, a few things need to happen.  First, they need to find your game in the sea of games, so some type of prominence in the Play store probably helps.  Second, from the rumors I have heard, the best that I can say is that they want games featured on the Play store that make people ""like"" android, and want to continue using it.  That means (simply my opinion here, but you are probably not going to get anything official) games that are already crazy popular, or games that users seek out, or games that, when taken into the Android ecosystem as a whole, improve the ecosystem as a whole, and make users want to spend more time and money on Android.  That means that you probably are using some of Google's fancy new services - after all, they Google's Android is competing against other flavors of Android.  That also means that it has an aesthetic that fits well with the rest of popular Android games (notice I didn't say Material Design, it is a game after all).  It should be different enough that users don't get bored, and exciting enough, that they see picking a game off the featured list as a positive experience.  Also, it should not have quirks or bugs - Android is still trying to shake off its reputation as a second class mobile OS!  If you get into the mind of the app reviewers, and try to guess what instructions corporate Google would give them for what apps to include, I think that is more helpful than simply ""you need to pay them off"" or ""you need 1,000,000 downloads""."

AndroidGaming,3dg4sm,PForPho,2,Thu Jul 16 00:26:14 2015 UTC,"""Best"" is subjective but I can recommend a few with active communities.  Brave Frontier- Tons of characters, gameplay is a bit grindy.  Community is pretty active and the game is still frequently being updated with more stuff.  Art style is great in my opinion, but they are not generous with premium currency so you'll have to pay if you really want to collect.  Summoner's War- Again very active community, very grindy.  Good amount of free premium currency, but the draw rates seem to be terrible, at least I never got anything really good when I was playing for a few months.  Chain Chronicle- Great tower defense-lite gameplay, the rest of the game is a gacha.  Actually has a pretty good story for a gacha rpg, reminds me of old classic RPGs.  You can drown yourself in the free premium currency, enough comes your way from events and side missions that you can get pretty much everything eventually for free (though of course it is faster to pay).  Million Arthur- Just launched in English, so there are still some issues to be hammered out.  Gameplay is typical card collector, similar to Rage of Bahamut or its hundreds of clones, so if you're looking for minimal gameplay and just collecting this is a good option.  Lots to collect, and the community is active since it just released.  Dragon Blaze- Classic RPG gameplay, but super grindy.  Decently generous with premium currency, you could play this for free.  Art style like Odin Sphere if you ever played that PS2 game.  Soccer Spirits- My personal favorite.  Best gameplay of the bunch, they actually turned soccer into a pretty believable card rpg.  As generous with premium currency as Chain Chronicle is, easy to get and ways to get it long term so you'll always be able to get things with time instead of money.  This is the only game in the bunch that I feel is truly fair to free players, since you can get everything the paid players get just slower.  Draw rates are a little wonky right now, but it also has a Scout system that lets you acquire players with pseudo-premium currency earned through PvP matches, so you have a pretty good chance of being able to get a player you want even if you don't get them in draws.  Also great music and UI, probably the easiest to use of the entire list."

AndroidGaming,3dg4sm,quick_useless,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:21:47 2015 UTC,"Since you've never heard the term, i'll let you know. Gacha is short for Gachapon which are toys/collectors items you get by random chance. Gachapon games (or Gacha games) are games where you pay a currency and get something back at random. Some people like them (especially developers) but some people think that if they're paying money they should be able to pick what they're getting.   The more you know!"
AndroidGaming,3dg4sm,SpaceSurfer-,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:46:15 2015 UTC,So you're paying real money to gamble for a virtual item? Can you sell these items back to someone for real money or? Is there anything else you do with the items or are they just status symbols if you happen to get a rare one?
AndroidGaming,3dg4sm,quick_useless,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:55:33 2015 UTC,"i'm not 100% familiar with it, but in Japan i think Gachapon shops are for real, tangible items that you can then resell or trade.

The game has infinite tickets where you start at 10 per play but its more for the sake of a Highscore competition that's relevant to how often you get higher ranking Gacha.  The game's IAP is just a permanent doubler if you want to speed up your Gacha's leveling by giving 2 Gacha worth of the one you caught."

But apart from that, this ""cons"":   Restart always from the beginning   While talking about roguelike is just enough to mildly infuriate me. And I'm not a roguelike fan at all.  Edit: I should have worded better. Despite the feature being bothering of course, it's the fact that it's presented as a cons that annoy me. Roguelike have some core mechanic that define the genre:   Steep difficulty curve Permadeath (Start from the beginning) Random generated map Turn based movement/combat (thanks /u/Graverobber2 I forgot it) (optional) Loot / Levels / Classes   If you list the permadeath as a cons, really I don't know what we're talking about anymore."
AndroidGaming,3ddlot,Graverobber2,5,Wed Jul 15 13:37:39 2015 UTC,"That's actually not a roguelike, but a roguelite.  Roguelike is also turnbased, with enemies moving at the same time you do. Sproggiwood/Crypt of the Necrodancer are good examples of roguelikes. Binding of isaac is a roguelite."
AndroidGaming,3ddlot,thecrius,2,Wed Jul 15 14:11:54 2015 UTC,"Right, absolutely forgot the turn based movement/combat"
AndroidGaming,3ddlot,thecrius,2,Wed Jul 15 14:36:51 2015 UTC,"Roguelike != Random map every game.   Sure, which I suppose is why there is a new term ""Roguelite"". Which I suppose some of these fall into, but really I think of it more in a looser sense as a genre, like platformer or FPS. There are many games that are action-platformers, but do they not also fall into the term platformer, same for FPS, may FPS games do not have a focus on shooting, but are they still not a FPS?   While talking about roguelike is just enough to mildly infuriate me. And I'm not a roguelike fan at all.   That is understandable as it is a feature of any roguelike, but not always one for roguelites. Which may cause some irritation when compared across games when some do and some don't. Some give the player rewards for their actions, earned items they keep for the next playthrough, others do not, to me it seems like a fair distinction to make.  *edit:   If you list the permadeath as a cons, really I don't know what we're talking about anymore.   It's not that the permadeath is a con, more so that the player has to start from scratch. Games like Wayward Souls allows for the player to build up their players despite their death, which at least gives a sense of progression, something that is lacking in a game like Out There. While yes, Wayward Souls is more of a roguelite, it still fits in the genre, which is why the distinctions are made with each's pros/cons."

AndroidGaming,3ddlot,Chief_Beef_Queef,2,Wed Jul 15 14:25:21 2015 UTC,"Pros   Lots of nerd references, movies, books, quotes. Random encounters include (off the top of my head) an encounter with the bearer of the one ring, which you can get as a usable item. Necronomicon. Trolls. Game devs. Stuff like that.   Dialogue is funny, like I said lots of references.   Loot loot loot. A lot of it is just different powered stuff of gear you have, but there's a decent amount of spells and weapons to collect and use to fit your play style.   Can save and quit from anywhere. Turn based so no worries about setting down your device.   Cons  Limited choice of starting heroes, you pick a party of three from six choices. Randomly chosen who the six are, each game gets five re rolls for heroes. Kind of a pro though cuz it forces you to switch up your play style sometimes.  Inventory space is limited, there's no chest or something to store stuff for later if you so wish.   You'll run through a dungeon and then have a random encounter on the way back and they'll fuck you in your ass with stupid powerful bullshit status effects fuck! Basically status immunity is too powerful not to concentrate on that so it makes the elements rather useless.   No way to carry anything over from run to run, unless you count the heroes you unlock."

I've always wanted an android roguelike that has the same scope and mechanics as Elona...which is basically a Roguelike Sandbox game that's......something....you can start off with a character that can breathe fire in the beginning of the game...and yes you can cook food with it too!!  Or to keep it simple, I want a perk system like in Doom The Roguelike or Cataclysm: Dark Days ahead."
AndroidGaming,3dek4d,Jimothyscrye,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:02:26 2015 UTC,Hrm.  I've not played any of the above.  Can you give me a better idea of which mechanics you liked?
AndroidGaming,3dek4d,Jimothyscrye,2,Wed Jul 15 18:16:34 2015 UTC,"Well, in Doom the Roguelike I liked the perk system which basically gives you a different set of skills and made characters unique despite having a class system.  There are perks that increase your melee damage, weapon damage, and hit points. Some also did you good like Hacking terminals and increased your running speed iirc. So yeah...a Perk System would do good in terms of giving diverse character classes....Doom The Roguelike had you pick from Space Marine, Scientist, and Assassin I think. The perk system is something that gives the impression of no 2 characters of the same class ever being alike."
AndroidGaming,3dek4d,Initial_Official,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:26:17 2015 UTC,"Ah, so basically a skill tree?  I'd planned on making some RPG elements in the game so that the game could (theoretically) be ""endless"".  So for instance, your character's ""level"" would be based on how many ""levels"" you'd managed to muscle your way through.  Every 5 levels, you get a ""skill"" point to spend. Higher skills cost more skill points.  In theory, you could have a character you'd worked on for a month, had crazy skills, but then died.  :D"
AndroidGaming,3dek4d,NitroxideShock,2,Wed Jul 15 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"uhh...yeah something like that. That every 5 levels thing actually reminds me of how elona gives you a new skill point to spend...which you can spend on the more absurd stuff like Vampirism or Hypnosis....or less absurd like Increased Stats and stuff depending on what you'd rather be.  Doesn't sound like leveling through beating levels is a bad idea. But I think that means the game's levels scale with yours. Not really making you that much stronger than ever before...but that's just me, maybe it'll be better than I think."
AndroidGaming,3dek4d,Mik0ri,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:43:18 2015 UTC,"""But I think that means the game's levels scale with yours.""    Yes, but the levels would also be randomized.  So say you focus on ""water"" magic/attacks, whatever.  When you come across a water level, it should be a cinch, so on those levels, you'll want to focus on collecting/killing monsters/resting/etc.  However, if you go to a ""fire"" level (obviously, this is all arbitrary at this point) you might want to make a bee-line for the exit instead, avoiding the creatures there.    In the lower levels, those kinds of decisions won't make much sense, or in the upper levels, if you've made your character evenly balanced, it'll be more even between the ""types"" of levels.    I really liked the way objects were handled in ""The Binding of Isaac"" too, so might have some of that in there, too."
AndroidGaming,3dek4d,blackrabbits,2,Wed Jul 15 18:54:34 2015 UTC,I'd like to see just a bunch of classes. That's what I always liked about DC:SS

The thing is, obviously devs are not going to bother implementing it as many don't know it exists and others just don't care. So Google needs to fix this problem, just as LG has on their devices having a built in way to force on a per app basis.

AndroidGaming,3dfvkx,camn,8,Wed Jul 15 23:11:55 2015 UTC,"It's probably better to ask subs like /r/gamedev or /r/Unity3D such questions, but I'll try to give an answer here regardless.  First of all, a simple, 2D top-down RPG is nowhere near ""nothing fancy"" in terms of difficulty. Making an RPG is extremely difficult. You'll have to make overworld scripts, some sort of party and inventory management system, battle systems (lots of work, especially if you want it to be as complex as KOTOR is), dialogue systems (along with the dialogue scripts, which can take forever to write). In addition to all this programming work, you'll also need art assets like music and graphics. Seeing as you're a CS student, I highly doubt that you have the skills necessary to be able to create a full RPG in Unity3D from scratch. I myself am a second year CS student at university and have been making games since 7th grade, when Flash was still an acceptable platform. I would probably never even go near creating an RPG unless I had a team of 5 or 6 people working on it with me.  Now that that's out of the way, I'd probably recommend making much more simple games first and building up with regards to complexity as you go along. I don't know how much game dev experience you have outside of Unity, but perhaps you could try to start with platformers, twin-stick shooters, or a clone of some famous game (Jetpack Joyride, Flappy Bird, etc). These would also need some asset creation on your end, but are a lot less involved than making an RPG. Make something completely stupid and easy and post it here for feedback.  Last thing I'd like to address is your, ""I won't be spending a dime on this, so you shouldn't either."" This is completely not the way you should want to think about your game dev skills. Regardless of the simplicity of a game, you, as a content creator, are going to be putting a lot of time into development. Don't undersell yourself! You don't need to expect to make $50 per hour you put in to the game like professional developers, but at least try to understand that your time is valuable, and that if you try hard and make a game worth purchasing, people will purchase it.  Please PM me or reply to comment if you have any more questions! I'm an enthusiastic young game developer and would be happy to help any other enthusiastic young game developers seeking to start making games!"
AndroidGaming,3dfvkx,raahilsha,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:00:52 2015 UTC,"I really just want an excuse to hone my art and programming skills. A huge RPG like I want to do will take literally forever as a single-man project, but I'm cool with that. Basically, my plan is to make a super barebones RPG and just add on to it daily until it's where I want it to be.  I've made a few little shmups, platformers, etc. and I've done a few little RPG lite projects just to figure out all of the coding for inventory management, items, shops, and all of that.  As for the money, if this were anything but something to do when I have downtime, I would charge for it. If it gets to the point where I'm spending insane amounts of time on it, I might charge."
AndroidGaming,3dfvkx,partisparti,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:23:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, I'm not OP but hopefully you can answer a question for me regardless.  So I'll be starting my third year in CS this fall and the one thing that I really need to work on at this point is building some personal projects.  I already had a great internship so unless some outstanding opportunity comes up I'll probably be spending a lot of time over the next year or so working on my own stuff.  Unfortunately I don't have much experience so I'm not sure where the best place to start would be.  I've been working my way through Google's beginner Android dev guide but I'm worried that I'm trying to dive into advanced stuff before I have the basics down.  All I've learned of Java has been self-taught online but I haven't really applied it in any way as the only languages I've worked with in courses are Python and C++, and what I did with those was very basic assignment-type projects that don't necessarily translate very well to real-world applications.  I guess what I'm worried about is that I'm trying to dive into the Android-specific nuances of a language that I don't feel completely comfortable with on a basic level yet.  So my question is, do you know of any good resources that'll walk me through some Java fundamentals in the context of Android development?  I searched google before making this post and found this guide, which I surprisingly haven't seen before but that looks like it might be helpful for me.  However, I'm also wondering about Unity since you and OP were talking about it.  If I only know a little about Java, I know nothing about Unity so I'm not sure if it's something I should be poking around with until I feel more comfortable making non-Unity apps.  I'm also somewhat hesitant to try to learn Unity as I don't plan on making games exclusively for Android; I just want to start with games because they're very familiar to me, and I feel like I'll have a much easier time wading my way through normal app development once I've made a few basic games.  So if you can provide any tips or useful links I'd appreciate it.  I know this is a pretty open-ended question so don't feel obligated to walk me through the whole process or anything like that.  It just seems to me that (and I know this sounds ridiculous) there are so many different resources available for learning programming it's kind of difficult to nail down which ones are specifically useful for learning more about a particular niche within app development."
AndroidGaming,3dfvkx,raahilsha,2,Thu Jul 16 13:30:51 2015 UTC,"To learn the fundamentals of Java, I'd probably recommend the Java Software Solutions book. Out of all the Java resources I've used, it's probably my favorite. The book is very clearly laid out and explains everything in nice, concise terms. The only problem with JSS is that it's meant mainly for beginners and won't help you much with upper level topics. If you have quite a bit of C++ experience, I'd probably recommend not using JSS and looking up online articles about inheritance, polymorphism, classes, and memory management in Java. Memory management and addresses in Java may be confusing to you as you come from a C++ background, where pointers are explicit. Java has implicit pointers to all objects (passed by reference) and passes primitive types by value. The Blue Pelican textbook is also pretty nice for understanding the weird nuances Java has that makes it different from other programming languages.  As for programming, the resources that you look into would be different depending on your goal. If you want to make games, I'd definitely recommend looking into Unity as a game engine. Don't even attempt to code up your own small engine within Android Studio/Eclipse. It would be a huge waste of time and you'd have to spend way too much time fixing bugs in your engine for it to be worthwhile. You can use either C# or JavaScript with Unity. C# is very similar to Java and JavaScript is a completely different language altogether. If you'd like to stick with C++, Unreal Engine is a very nice choice. The learning curve is pretty steep, but Unreal is a very powerful engine. I'd prefer Unreal over Unity if not for Unity's simplicity. For 2D games, I'd stick to Unity.  If you don't really want to do games specifically, it would probably be a good idea to pick some sort of field and focus on it. Since you know Python and C++, you could look into artificial intelligence, image processing, or other related topics. These are pretty nice for small personal projects that you could put on a resume to look fancy. For example, you could probably be able to make some sort of predictive AI for stock prices pretty easily using neural networks or some time series model. Make sure to remember that there are a ton of libraries for this kind of stuff already available (OpenCV, Neuroph, etc) and you wouldn't have to actually create a neural network from scratch with linear algebra. Take as much advantage of you can of work that more experienced people have published for free on the Internet!  As for mobile development in general, you may actually consider looking into iOS development before Android development. I know that this is an Android Gaming subreddit that would most likely be appalled by that suggestion, but since you know C++, iOS would be slightly easier to pick up. You can use Objective-C++ to make iOS apps (combination of C++ and objective C), so the learning curve for you would be a lot slighter there. If you want to do Android more for some reason, use Android Studio and try to build a simple, non-game app first. Learn how to use Activities and switch between them with some amount of data retention, figure out how views and organizing elements works, and try to build up something simple, even an app that tracks the number of times a user clicks a button.  The upcoming semesters, make sure to take some higher level math classes if you can/haven't already. Having a background in multivariable calculus really helps a lot when making video games and would help a lot with understanding 3D space and making algorithms that work within it. Linear algebra is really useful for artificial intelligence and would probably give you an introduction to some of the more advanced topics you'd have to learn when making a game engine. Don't know if your university has a course in it, but a course in computer graphics that uses OpenGL would probably cover a lot of useful information (quaternions, interpolation, how animation works, etc). I took this course last fall and found it to be seriously helpful with respect to game development.  Hope that my answer pointed you in the right direction with regards to things to learn! Let me know if there's anything you need clarification on!"

AndroidGaming,3dfvkx,partisparti,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"Wow man.  I can't thank you enough for writing all of this out!!  This is hugely helpful and I really appreciate it.  I'm definitely going to pick up a copy of JSS, as I have some good reference texts for both Python and C++ from earlier courses but I have nothing pertaining to Java.  (As a side note, do you have any idea why my school wouldn't offer any Java-based courses? It seems like it's one of the most widely-used languages out there right now, and yet my school hasn't offered any Java courses since 2004. This is a state school with ~50,000 enrollment, so I can't imagine it's a staffing or attendance issue, which means there must be some other reason? I dunno, point is moot at any rate.)  I think JSS will be perfect for me because while I do have some experience with C++, I'm not confident that I know enough about it conceptually to identify the major differences from Java.    As for a project, I think for the time being I'm going to hold off on getting into any Unity/Unreal development as I don't plan on working in game development (not at first, at least).  I imagine that's something I'll tinker with more as a hobby so I'd rather hold off on that stuff until I have my degree.  I think I'm going to look into some potential AI-related projects, as that's a field I'm interested in and I'll also be in a machine learning/AI class next semester.  Besides that, I started building up an investment portfolio once I started making some money from my internship so I think something stock market-related could be a great project for me since I've been slowly learning more about that stuff over the past few months to begin with.  I'll see if I can't come up with any cool ideas in that vein.  I'll look into iOS development as well.  Definitely not opposed to it, the main reason I decided to go with Android to begin with is because I have an Android phone currently so I figured it'd be easier to test anything I write that way.  That doesn't really matter though with virtual machines.  Additionally, TBH, I'm not crazy about the Android platform based on what I've done so far (made an app that lets you enter text into a field which will be displayed on the screen after submitting it).  Of course that's probably just because it was all very new to me.  I'm still up in the air on that one though because I do think it would probably be helpful to learn the basics of Android as I'm improving my Java competency but I'll just play that one by ear.  I do have one question regarding math and computer science.  I'm glad to hear multivariable calc is useful for game development as that was probably my strongest math course to date.  Linear algebra is (I believe) the only relevant math course I have yet to take so I'll knock that out within the next two semesters.  My question, however - is there a lot of overlap between computer science and differential equations?  I'm wondering because I really struggled with DiffEq, had to retake it once and I still had trouble the second time around.  Just one of those courses that I had a really hard time wrapping my brain around - I was fine with the basics but things got rocky for me when we got into stuff like eigenvectors/eigenvalues and (to a somewhat lesser extent) Laplace transforms.  Based on the applications of that stuff that I'm aware of I'm hoping it isn't really all that relevant for CS, but if it is I'm probably going to need to practice that stuff independently.  Again, I can't thank you enough for all the information.  My school does indeed offer an advanced graphics class that uses OpenGL, though I'm going to plan on taking that next year as it's a very high-level course at my school.  This was really helpful for me and it's very much appreciated!!"
AndroidGaming,3dfvkx,raahilsha,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:01:22 2015 UTC,"Unless you're doing some kind of applied computer science (to Physics, Engineering, etc) you probably won't need to know more than a basic level of Diff Eq. You will probably have to apply calculus somewhere along the way (differentials and integrals), but I haven't come across a problem outside of physics where I've had to use the material taught in DiffEq for CS. As for eigenvectors/eigenvalues/Laplace, if you ever actually do run across a problem involving them, you'll more than likely have access to some kind of library that can help you solve the problem.  Most schools usually don't have a Java course since a C++ course can usually cover everything taught in a Java course, as well as other topics such as memory management. Here is a pretty nice Reddit thread as to why an intro-level CS course would teach C over Python, which could provide a few insights as to why a course would teach C++ over Java. Universities mainly try to teach ""Computer Science,"" a skill that's a lot more important than any one programming language, and C++ and Python both have their own advantages over Java when it comes to teaching Computer Science. Java may be more useful as a programming language when it comes to projects in the real world, but what you can learn from learning C++ or Python trumps that for the same reasons that an Economics course doesn't teach you about how to do taxes. The assumption is, that if you can learn C++, you'll probably be able to pick up Java on the job after a week or so. (And after you learn about five or so programming languages, picking up another one will only take you about a day or so. Try to pick up a few diverse programming languages as you go and maybe take a course on web development. Doesn't really seem like what you're trying to aim for in terms of career development, but web dev is always a nice fallback if your primary options end up not working.)"

I learned the basics of Java and Object-Oriented programming when I took AP Comp Sci in high school."
AndroidGaming,3dfvkx,partisparti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:50:06 2015 UTC,"Well, I have learned some programming, just not any Java (excepting what I learned independently).  At my college, the equivalent to your Computer Science I is probably very similar except they use Python rather than Java.  The next level of that course used C++, and I also used some C to write assembly in my computer architecture course.  I was initially wondering why my college chose to use Python and C++ for the introductory-level courses, rather than Java which seems to be used much more commonly.  After thinking about it a bit more though I can understand why they omitted Java considering how much easier it is to pick up if you have some experience in C++ (or another similar language).  Still not quite sure why they use Python for the very first class in the subject.  I suppose it's because the syntax can be a bit easier to pick up when compared to C++ and others, though that's probably a matter of perspective."

It is their answer to Order and Chaos Online to take over the world of MicroTransactions lol. In general it will be another MMORPG with 5 classes and as far as i've seen its more of a casual take on MMO's so if you want Intense skill-based play go Order and Chaos, if you want casual play go for Forsaken World Mobile (FWM is scheduled to be released at the end of this month.)"

AndroidGaming,3d8gi4,whatarethebest,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:58:23 2015 UTC,"Here are some games that may get you hooked on. Yes they're all portrait mode games.  Soul Unleashed - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.qualiasoft.soulunleashed.en  Its currently 0.99 for the first 5000 buyers, I've never played a pen & paper RPG before but this one has quite the immersive world. The RPG elements are one of the most unique things about this game. You play as a total nobody with an ambition and a choice of skills that determine both your playstyle and the game's progression. You and 3 other randomly chosen party members set foot in adventures to stuff from Forests and other Towns to Dungeons and Catacombs. Its basic D&D esque stuff with a little more freedom of choice with skills that determine your playstyle like Magic Missiles, Combat Skills, and Healing Spells and also skills that might come in handy in your adventures like Locksmith, Summon Light, and Detect Evil. Oh and the game pretty linear.  Nebulous - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=software.simplicial.nebulous  If agar.io hooks your on this is an offline alternative with a lot of game modes and bot support.  Landscape (Its a portrait game I swear) - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.voidgames.landscapegame  A pretty nice village building game that reminds me of Townsmen on the old J2me mobile phones. You basically lead a town with different needs and stuff. Feeding your citizens with bread, coffee, and religious fervor. This one is a little more complex in that you need to be careful in the resources you'll spend for the resources you need which is always a breather when you think about how most games like this tend to have a bare bones supply and demand system. Basically you can't make a self-sustaining city from the get go, you need to think ahead and plan your resources wisely which is something not a lot of mobile city management pull off. The graphics are nice too....basically crossy chicken with a calming and gentle theme."

AndroidGaming,3d8i2l,nowifinodie,3,Tue Jul 14 09:37:34 2015 UTC,The hair customization is really nice
AndroidGaming,3d8i2l,Wafz,4,Wed Jul 15 17:15:06 2015 UTC,"It's a surprisingly pretty game. The UI isn't all over the place, the overall aesthetic is pleasant, and everything runs smoothly enough. I like that you can disable displaying other players in town - helps when you're figuring out where stuff is/offsets any lag. The only thing that put me off was that it seems whether you play as a boy or girl, outside of some specific hairstyles, you pretty much look and move like a woman, as though the devs intended you to be a woman from the get-go. Not a huge deal, but it is kinda funny watching my male character be so lady-like.  EDIT:  Well, given it's a beta, I suppose this isn't a huge surprise, but it's rather short. Level cap is 45, I beat the last ""boss"" at level 30-ish, solo'd the entire way through (I'm level 37 now). Technically I was under leveled but there's a few things that make soloing it possible for lower level characters.  What follows is a short review.  Gameplay: Nothing terribly original, but it works and is somewhat more involved than you might expect. Enemies have special attacks which have tells and can thus be avoided - decent timing is beneficial if you don't want to spend all your healing stuff quickly. Bosses have breakable parts, triggered by successful special attacks, wherein you tap the screen to do damage to the part. Breaking it gives the chance for rare drops, as I understand it. Not sure what all the parts are used for as of yet, as I was able to get some of the better equips without a lot of them. The story quests give crazy amounts of exp - I would often level 3 or 4 times simultaneously.  Community is mostly a bunch of needy folks who can't spell, but hey, mobile game, goes with the territory. I actually never had need of a full party to progress, so I didn't meet a whole lot of folks (chat did get absurd fairly often). Nothing particularly abusive or offensive that I saw. Lots of Indonesians.  Graphics are as I said before surprisingly nice. Vivid colors and fairly good detail, and each area tends to have a unique feel.   One thing to keep in mind: In the beginning, there's an opportunity to get an absolute shitload of healing items, and set them to auto-use when you're at low health. You are also given a bunch of ""orbs"" (an eventual alternative currency, currently free) which allow for revives during boss fights. Properly used, you can solo everything without too much issue.   Overall, I'm looking forward to updates. I've seen a bit of the content the Japanese version has and it seems like it will get more interesting as time goes on. It IS a beta, so you will see some areas that are inaccessible for now. Here's to hoping; if you want a traditional MMO experience, and were in particular a fan of stuff like Ragnarok or Asobimo's other games, you'll enjoy Toram."

Translations seem pretty good with little jokes thrown in.

AndroidGaming,3d8dip,meetbaxter,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:36:20 2015 UTC,"World of Tanks Blitz offers some good stats, pretty much everything you do, you can check out on your profile at any time (i.e damage done with a specific tank, games survived, kills, deaths, damage taken, playtime, enemies spotted, etc). It logs eveything you do in the game very well and precisely, you can check out specific stats for specific tanks or just your overall stats if you are interested in those. World of Tanks Blitz"

AndroidGaming,3d8aw8,hillman_avenger,2,Tue Jul 14 08:00:04 2015 UTC,"It's like Laser Squad remake but in real time. Plays strange, especially because you can't control all units at once and some are getting killed without you even knowing. I think proper turn based movement would greatly improve gameplay."
AndroidGaming,3d8aw8,oskarw85,3,Tue Jul 14 08:29:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the comment. :) In this version, the unit icons flash when your unit can see the enemy, and the icon disappears altogether when the unit is killed.  I think the real skill in this game is using the limited Pause option when the action kicks off.  BTW, there is a ""proper"" turn-based version: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scs.stellarforces.main.lite"

Either way it's really fun  Catan is a board game but it does have online play, if they don't know how to play a comprehensive tutorial is included and it's really not a hard game to understand.  Quiz Up used to be good but apparently some changes have been made that make it pay to play recently, it's still a really solid trivia game regardless"
AndroidGaming,3d7q4n,DankBake,3,Tue Jul 14 04:10:49 2015 UTC,"They're by the same developer. Space Marshals is tactical and stealthy with some storyline. Xenowerk is a dual-stick action shooter- same controls as SM but no stealthy element, just sweep and clear a level at a time.  No IAPs in SM, yes there are in Xenowerk.  Overall, I think SM is a better game, but XW has its charms as a simple dive-in-and-blow-stuff-up diversion. SM also isn't done (storyline)."
AndroidGaming,3d7q4n,loopgru,2,Tue Jul 14 05:48:03 2015 UTC,"Xenowerk. It's all kinds of fun and gives a sort of Metroid feel to it. You may want to try Implosion, though it's not real lesser known now that is but the 1 million download mark."

Most other games catch those signals and immediately save the game. No clue in the world why this guy can't do that."
AndroidGaming,3d9zkv,TinynDP,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:35:02 2015 UTC,"It's possible that the save system isn't flexible enough to allow for that scenario without significant work. It's pretty clearly designed around a desktop paradigm. I think the Bard's Tale comparison is an apt one because in earlier versions of the game you simply lost any progress made after the last save point. The ability to restore ""unsaved progress"" was added to Bard's Tale later, probably as a direct result of user feedback. Both games faced a very similar issue. That said, Bard's Tale has a bugger budget, bigger market and a bigger development house behind it, so that kind of change was probably an easier expense to swallow."
AndroidGaming,3d9zkv,dandmcd,3,Thu Jul 16 14:28:30 2015 UTC,"While I wasn't mad enough to write a long rant, I just downloaded and played it 2 days ago and had the same experience.  I got a text and went to check it, just 5 seconds later return to the game to see I'm no longer in the dungeon.  I was a bit pissed at the game and haven't had an urge to play since.  This game needs a pause feature, and perhaps I will again try to play it, because I'm constantly playing games while in the subway, and I don't have 15 minutes to devote to one dungeon.  I think the concept of this game is great, but the graphics are some of the worst on Android I've ever seen, and the game interface could use some work."

AndroidGaming,3d7o1f,SakiSumo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:41:40 2015 UTC,what was the main problem you'd say with the build quality? Felt structurally weak? I'm not really expecting a hardcore screen on it. Likely get a screen protector with it as well.
AndroidGaming,3d7o1f,SacaSoh,2,Tue Jul 14 08:45:38 2015 UTC,"Feels cheap and light.   Screen had a large dead spot.  Left Joystick would stick.  Right Joystick ended up permanently off centre.  Battery wasnt as tight as it should be meaning if your a little rough with it, it would come loose and instantly shut down.  Power button would get stuck on.  After about 3 months, I went to power it off, but it wouldnt respond to my presses of the power button. So i just removed the battery. Restarted it and it now displays a Dead Android mascot.  It was a good device. But quality was terrible.  I also had the S5800 (the phone version) and it was just as problematic."
AndroidGaming,3d7o1f,DankBake,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:10:43 2015 UTC,Dang. Seems like a cheap Chinese product but even for the price I'd hope for a bit if quality in the build.
AndroidGaming,3d7o1f,nightblair,2,Tue Jul 14 09:23:09 2015 UTC,"Why don't you just get an ipega 9023 or moga pro for your phone (probably more powerful than the jxd device)?  If you want the best jxd-ish device get the nvidia shield portable, it destroys jxd in performance, and it humiliates any device in build quality (sole Android controller with analog triggers and no deadzone on sticks)."
AndroidGaming,3d7o1f,scream4cheese,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:28 2015 UTC,"Because its cumbersome. I already have a Bluetooth phone controller anyways.

AndroidGaming,3d7o1f,xoleras20099,2,Tue Jul 14 13:50:06 2015 UTC,"Basically there are two issues which .  During charging, the reported percentage rises quickly to 100% (after restarting, it displays correct value). Or, more rare problem, does not charge at all (plug in, charge 10-20% then after whole night charging no increase). After restarting or plugging the connector again it works again.  It haven't occurred when charging from discharged battery, but when charging after half battery is gone then all these issues are happening. Might be some calibration problem I suppose.  People on forums tried lot of solutions and for someone works this, for some other that. I've seen:   replacing motherboard at service shop replacing battery replacing usb connector replacing charger replacing charger cable trying to calibrate battery by discharging and turning off it for a while   You'll see. Many people does not have any problems at all!"

I've heard it explained (from what was supposedly a developer) that the idea is they get more exposure and would sell more because of it. What it did instead was increase the number of people who had it (and therefore demand for updates, servers, etc) without much of an increase in revenue.

For example early on I was worried that (like a lot of CYOA books) I was going to be railroaded into doing what the book wanted me to (basically helping the American military win a war), so I was surprised that my attempt to flee the country and seek asylum was actually a valid path and I was allowed to stay neutral in the war without getting a game over."

AndroidGaming,3d3r84,Jaws_Elevator,6,Mon Jul 13 17:53:56 2015 UTC,No IAP. Most choice games have a demo and IAP to buy the game. This is clean and free of IAP.
AndroidGaming,3d3r84,xavim2000,2,Mon Jul 13 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"The top amazon review is critical of the developers for copy/pasting the code/permissions between the free and premium versions.  There are no IAP in this premium version, but they were too lazy to change the required permissions, so it shows up as having IAP, thus scaring people like yourself away."

AndroidGaming,3d60z8,Andymetoo,2,Mon Jul 13 20:16:25 2015 UTC,"My preferred real-world based game is Ingress. Although it's quite a bit different than PK and does require moving, it's a lot of fun. It definitely gets better when you connect with other players. Practically every area has an organized resistance or enlightened group, usually through G+ and hangouts. Asking in the local in game chat or googling will help you find them."

AndroidGaming,3d60z8,CircumcisedSpine,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:54:27 2015 UTC,Haha that's convenient. I wish we had a setup but the nearest portal is a few blocks away. Would be nice!
AndroidGaming,3d60z8,Initial_Official,2,Tue Jul 14 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"We recently moved from the suburb of one city to the downtown of another... and it's been great for Ingress. I'm buried in portals that are in walking distance. Our old place, there were maybe a couple of portals for every square mile or so. You'd have to get in a car to hit more than one or two.   Of course, I wouldn't suggest moving just for Ingress... but we did pick this location because we wanted to live someplace walkable. Ingress turned out to be a fringe benefit. Plus the local player groups are pretty cool."

AndroidGaming,3d1ogk,htid85,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:28:13 2015 UTC,Because that particular sentence's template makes the hashtag two of the words you used attached to each other. So they played the words Indented and Vaginas separately.

AndroidGaming,3d1ogk,createweb,2,Mon Jul 13 03:40:15 2015 UTC,"Been enjoying the game a lot. Only thing I don't like one bit is the ""nap"" system. When your score is so highly dependent on what bears you're able to use at the time, it absolutely cheapens the value of skill and makes the game much less rewarding.   I bought the $5 infinite honey thing but now I'm on chapter three, barely able to get a gold on any of the levels unless my best bears are active.   If you're reading this, devs, please overhaul the nap system. There are much less intrusive and cheapening ways to monetize a game.   Asides from that, excellently made game!"

AndroidGaming,3d1ogk,tenpn,1 point,Tue Jul 14 07:25:32 2015 UTC,"Hi, I am one of the devs that worked on Alphabear. I appreciate how this can seem frustrating, but there are three things I'd say: - getting silver isn't necessarily a bad thing. sometimes there's good drops in silver eggs - try levelling up a range of bears so you've always got some that are awake or close to waking - we know some of the events are a bit imbalanced, and we're looking to rebalance them in the next day or two. This will happen via server, not via an app update, so keep an eye out!"

AndroidGaming,3d5itn,LunosOuroboros,2,Mon Jul 13 18:11:03 2015 UTC,It's powerful enough for GBA and PSX games. You might experience some lags in some psp games but most of them should work fine (I managed to get 30 fps in games like monster hunter or crisis core on a much worse device).  The OS version is outdated though. That might cause some problems.
AndroidGaming,3d5itn,Imasgrohn,2,Mon Jul 13 18:24:37 2015 UTC,"Powerful enough for everything up to PS1 and some N64 titles. Also portables up to and including NDS (DraStic). It may not do well for PSP, only way to know is to try it and see.  If it's still on Android 4.0, you also have the option of using a Wii controller with it if that's your thing, Wii bluetooth support stopped working after Android 4.1.

AndroidGaming,3d3qwy,celphy,3,Mon Jul 13 13:30:12 2015 UTC,"I agree on Hearthstone. While I have bought deck packs and arena entries, you can do well without buying anything.   Just do the daily quests to earn gold. Then use your gold for arena matches. At worst you spent 50 extra good for a pack. At best you'll do well and get multiple packs.  Then there is the new Tavern brawl which earns you a pack. Heck, I won a pack last night and it had a legendary card I hadn't gotten yet.   It's slower to do it that way,  but you can survive for free."

AndroidGaming,3d3qwy,pastarific,3,Mon Jul 13 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"Ascention .. you cant end game or reach top level without IAP.    Ascension is expansions, not ""packs.""  All players draw off of a single deck.  You literally cannot have a ""pay2win"" model.  Its far and away my #1 played android game that isn't from supercell.  edit: And its 1/10 the price of the physical version.  And you don't have to do all the scorekeeping, shuffling, etc. by hand."
AndroidGaming,3d3qwy,KPipes,2,Mon Jul 13 16:15:11 2015 UTC,"I can see why you'd want it all free, etc. but I think what you're asking for is a bit much, no offence..  Think of physical TCG/CCG decks. They aren't free - you have to spend a bit of money to play and build a good deck. The game store isn't going to just give you free sleeves. Time and energy and money went into these games. Doesn't make sense to be free with no catch. The best players with physical decks spent money to get there. Why would it be any different in virtual format?  Most of the games you've listed are great, and if you like one of them the spend a few bucks to get some sleeves and build out your collection.  Star Realms is a good choice because it isn't a CCG. You start with the entire deck. It's just deck/hand management.  Shadow Era is also a good option for cheap. You get to pick one starter deck. If you focus on just that build, you can buy/sell cards and get a free daily card (many of which will be rare or epic). If they don't match your starter deck build sell them and buy something that does. They often have sales on sleeves and packs so you can build a great set for a few bucks here and there.  Hearthstone goes without saying."
AndroidGaming,3d3qwy,FredDerfman,2,Mon Jul 13 13:44:30 2015 UTC,"He didn't say free, he said no p2w IAP."
AndroidGaming,3d3qwy,KPipes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:33:33 2015 UTC,"meh that's semantics if you ask me. He asked for a game that doesn't require IAP. In other words a game you can master the leaderboard without money. I.e. Free.  My point stands. Virtual CCG mirror the payment model of the physical cards at least for the good ones. You don't win and hell, can't even play those without buying some packs or a starter deck.   Edit: and for the record I'm not knocking the payment model here. I think it actually makes sense. You pay a buck or two for a pack of cards, just like back in nineteen-dickety-two when only physical cards were available at the corner store."
AndroidGaming,3d3qwy,FredDerfman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:45:38 2015 UTC,"Don't be silly. He asked for a game with ""NON IAP n gameplay"". He complained about games where ""you cant end game or reach top level without IAP"". He didn't ask for a free game, or a game with IAP to turn off ads or anything like that. He made it very clear that he wants to avoid P2W.  That fact that you see P2W IAP as the same thing as a paid game without IAP says a lot more about you then about him. You are probably pretty much alone in that position."
AndroidGaming,3d3qwy,KPipes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:55:12 2015 UTC,You've lost the point. Virtual card games mimic the real physical game. You do not win without spending something on cards. My point was you can't expect to be the best at mobile CCG realistically without investing a few bucks.  That's it.   I'm not an idiot. I know the difference between a ftp and paid game.  I'm just sick of the mentality of expecting high quality games without spending anything on them. We all bitch about IAP and PTW and forget those models are there because no one will fork out anything for quality content.
AndroidGaming,3d3qwy,FredDerfman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:27:20 2015 UTC,"You say you know the difference, but three times now you have gone the route of ""not wanting P2W"" is the same thing as ""not being willing to pay anything at all for a game"".  First you said:   I can see why you'd want it all free, etc...   and then:   He asked for a game that doesn't require IAP. In other words a game you can master the leaderboard without money. I.e. Free.   and then:   I'm just sick of the mentality of expecting high quality games without spending anything on them.   Its comments like this that make it look like you think that not wanting to P2W is the same thing as not wanting to pay anything at all.   If you want to argue that Virtual CCG have to have IAP is they are going to mimic real world ones, you might have a point. Its not the point you were making before, but it is a possibly valid point. And if you want to argue that games these days are all P2W, because that's what people pay for, you might have another one. But don't tell the OP he's asking for free when developers need to make money, because that's not what he said."

Yes, the game has IAP's, but I got the sense that these were just for people who were really impatient with the system and wanted to build their collection immediately. The game was originally designed as a pay-up-front game where packs/cards are then earned through game play. If you can afford 30 minutes in the game once a day then you will be able to build up your first tournament quality deck within a week or two."

But I'm sure if I do manage to pull a rare specialist then of course that'd be better its just a gamble.  I think I'm on day 3 or 4 for the daily reward"
AndroidGaming,3cxo6g,mindsystem,2,Sat Jul 11 21:27:54 2015 UTC,"I have the ARMS, carrier, and laser upgrades. I think that after you get the laser or ARMS upgrades, it unlocks their specialists when you draw. So I would suggest waiting on those, since they would decrease your chances of getting the other specialists. Also, if you look at the math, the carrier doubles the speed for the first upgrade (60 initial + 60 upgrade), while the refrigerator only gives a 20% boost in price per sample. So if you're selling all your samples you should get double the profit from before within the same time frame if you get the carrier. Plus, if you accidentally sell samples you needed to build a truck or something, there's less time to wait to make up for your mistake. TL;DR: if you get a cube upgrade, go for the carrier (or wait to get the cube detector)."
AndroidGaming,3cxo6g,SushiBlade,2,Sun Jul 12 04:41:46 2015 UTC,It would be better to save your quantum cubes for the cube finder specialist and the zombie finder. That would eventually make farming cubes and super zombies easier since you dont have to scroll

It's like Brothers in that Brothers is barely a game and has a story that wouldn't see praise if it were a movie or a book (because it's so basic), but it's alright. Yet people talk it up as this extremely great thing, and that causes other people to go in with inflated expectations only to leave disappointed. It really taints the game.  Your opening sentences also make me wonder how many games you've played if you really consider this to be ""one of the best games/experiences ever"".

And plus, this is a paid game, there's no way for people to try it without actually paying for it, so people might buy it based on my opinion of it and then regret it and feel disappointed. But also on that, since this game is a paid game, hearing different opinions helps people decide whether or not it would be worth their money.  I've tried a lot of mobile games, and most of the time I didn't play for more than a few minutes. Which is a big part of why I was fascinated by this one.

Some of the ""right"" decisions are mindbogglingly stupid so I just feel like Im doing a coin toss every time and being punished for it.  Also I get pulled out of the game or un-immersed or whatever you want to call it when Taylor literally jokes about everything that is happening.  I feel like if you were in a life or death survival situation you would be panicking and freaking out and not very humorous.  To top it off if I had to choose to tell a story with only images or video and no dialogue (like say brothers a tale of two sons) versus a game with no images or imagery or video component whatsoever like lifeline I feel the former has a lot more going for it.  Having taylor have to describe everything is almost fourth wall breaking because she sometimes has hidden knowledge that doesnt really make sense or says things people wouldnt really say for the purposes of the games cohesion.  The game would have been better served by having some sort of third party narration or having the suit relay information to you such that taylor didnt have to describe everything.

And I can tell you this, there's no one decision that will make or break the result, it's more about the general direction you take. The game gives you a lot of chances to take certain decisions back.   As for it being limited to text and text alone, I really think that's part of what made me like it so much. It really felt like I was texting a person stranded on a moon. I didn't have all the details, I couldn't see the whole picture, I didn't know what the character was going through other than what she told me, and that's what made this more of an experience to me than just a game.

AndroidGaming,3cw4mt,ObeseCarrot,1 point,Sat Jul 11 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"It's really subjective. To me it really was one of the best games that I've played on Android. It really doesn't mean it's the best for everyone or anything like that. And I agree with you, it's less a game and more of an interactive story but also, the fact that you can make Taylor go back and forth, made it move closer towards being a game. I agree with everything else though.. Oh the cliffhangers"
AndroidGaming,3cw4mt,FrozenMangoAP,3,Sat Jul 11 20:33:27 2015 UTC,"I genuinely enjoyed it.  ... in the beginning. Then it honestly got worse and worse - and the ending I got.. I was very disappointed with how it ended (took me three days, but the last five minutes of it was rushed to darn much). I was genuinely having a ""what..? that's it? :/"" moment - and when I saw the ""You can go back and play it again to see different outcomes"", I just uninstalled it.  So many times the writing broke the immersion -  especially the stuff in brackets. Worth the money, but... yeah - I hope someone takes the idea, gets a better writer and implements some more depth to it.  Fantastic idea, though - and I have recommended it to many people, but it's really not as great when you get deeper into it."
AndroidGaming,3cw4mt,Mik0ri,3,Sat Jul 11 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Guess I'll be another ""I enjoyed it"" since so many people want to rain on the parade. I think it is a lovely idea for mobile gaming/story telling and I hope it is expanded upon further. It is like a visual novel and a choose your own adventure,  but the format really fit the story/scenario and made it more engaging.   I also loved that it was simple and approachable. Some rpgs have great story, but take hours of gameplay to get there. And for a mobile game, the time between events made it easier to digest."
AndroidGaming,3cw4mt,I_cant_speel,2,Sat Jul 11 17:39:44 2015 UTC,I think it's really your second point was what drew me in. It took nothing for me to feel like I was involved and wanting more. I think I didn't give a lot of good games a chance because they're weren't so engaging from the start
AndroidGaming,3cw4mt,eddied96,7,Sat Jul 11 20:19:40 2015 UTC,"It just really didnt do anything for me, I felt like Taylor was just a less charismatic, worse written Mark Whatney from The Martian, didn't find the character believable at all."
AndroidGaming,3cw4mt,I_cant_speel,0,Sat Jul 11 09:12:40 2015 UTC,"Like I said before, for some reason, thinking of Taylor as a guy made me like him, but not too much. Thinking of him as a girl, the second time, made her charming and funny.. And I know that's kind of sexist, but I've always like having female friends over male friends, so maybe that's why"
AndroidGaming,3cw4mt,HornyDBalzac,4,Sat Jul 11 20:40:07 2015 UTC,"I played through it all and, to be honest, it wasn't really that amazing. The dialogue was awfully sarcastic and annoying, which just made me hate Taylor. On top of that the game really felt very linear, with only 3 locations to actually travel to, and with a pretty underwhelming ending. 5/10 for me"

I mean, I recommend the game, but it played more like a tech demo for the concept of notification-games, it wasn't special. I enjoyed the writing and liked Taylor, but it was extremely short and had a very standard trope set. Not something I would expect anyone to be floored by.  Now that 3 Minute Games has got confirmation that we love the format, I'm hoping they'll get down to making a game that's a bit meatier."

AndroidGaming,3cvow3,Redd575,3,Sat Jul 11 04:53:45 2015 UTC,"This is important: you need to have a good wifi router, or else it will be laggy and slow. Internet speed doesn't matter, but be sure that your router transmits at a high speed.   You also need a computer with at least a GTX 660. That's an Nvidia graphics card, and as long as your graphics card is numbered 660 or higher, it will work.   They make laptops with Nvidia graphics cards, but laptops are suboptimal for streaming because you can just move a laptop around. If you have a desktop computer, you might be able to just stick a graphics card in it and buy the tablet.   Finally, the shield tablets are good for streaming games, if you want to stream video there are cheaper and less hardware intensive ways to do it."
AndroidGaming,3cvow3,nudemanonbike,2,Sat Jul 11 17:43:32 2015 UTC,"Nudemanonbike nails it right on the head. I've got a fairly powerful desktop (i7 5960x / 980ti SLI) and I feel like my SHIELD performs on par with my N7 solely because my access point isn't exactly 'good'. On the contrary, my STEAM box works wonderfully over a wired connection.  On a different note, I experimented with an OTG cable and a USB Ethernet adapter, and it reinforced the fact that the access point is an extremely deciding factor."

AndroidGaming,3cvow3,muimu,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:30:29 2015 UTC,I dont know about other tablets but the shield tablet is very good at streaming.  You need a good quality wifi signal or ethernet. Speed isnt quite as important as quality. The shield streaming is much more stable than steam streaming to my laptop even when i use wired ethernet.   Think carefully about what you want to play. I am currently working my way through the fallout series and civ 5. Civ 5 doesnt really work with it and fallout whilst controller friendly isnt as good with a controller.

I think I'm mostly done with the campaign and so far I've more than gotten my money's worth out of it. There's definitely enough to do in it that I'm probably going to play the campaign again and explore the other 50% of the game I didn't get a chance to see.

Baldur's Gate would work fine on the SP3, really you can look up just about any game you want to play on YouTube with ""Surface Pro 3"" in front of the game and find videos detailing how well it will run.  Almost any game will run fine on the G3, the only exceptions would be Portal, Half-Life 2, and similar but I've even seen where people have ran them fine as well with some tweaks.  Edit: Why haven't you bought an external DVD drive for your SP3?

I really liked Soccer Spirits but I stopped because no new content (just story mode, a colloseum, PVP and regular dungeons). Great game still, worth a try.  Summoners War also good but leveling up units is a pain in the arse. Similar to Soccer Spirits but even tougher here. Otherwise, pretty similar to BF.  One Piece Treasure Cruise is also good. Requires more timing of attacks than BF.   All have drawing/summoning units/players/monsters."
AndroidGaming,3cv9dt,ZedTemp,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:32:24 2015 UTC,"Soccer Spirits has a new update teased, probably coming out at the end of the month that is adding quite a bit.  Most of their updates tend to be smaller, balance patches and adding individual players rather than massive patches.  This new one is pretty large though, and is including their Club (clan) system.  Also unit levelling is actually really easy in SS if you use the penguin matches you can purchase through the in-game store.  They are only 10 crystals (you can earn that much in less than five minutes in story mode), and each set of three penguins is worth around 10 to 20 levels depending on how close the player is to max level.  Summoner's War is a total grind though to get any kind of leveling done, so I definitely agree with that."

Recently I started playing ""Guardian Hunter"", it's very fun, but it's kinda big and I hate that for some reason it needs permission for SMSs (I'm very picky with games with odd permissions, hence why I don't play Soccer spirits). I can say it's fun so far, there's many game modes, including a very artificial PVP (as in I doubt it's in real time), PVE, survival mode and raids (which I havn't tested yet) and activities involving clans.  I would recommend you Chain Chronicle (Developed by SEGA, ran by GUMI) but unfortunately unlike Brave Frontier it's very mismanaged by GUMI. We've been expecting ""Version 2"" to come, but they refuse to follow sega's schedule so one way or another we always end up being screwed. The core game is great, but the mismanagement is killing it.  I tried Road to Dragon, is very colorful, but the interface was clunky, unintuitive and it heated/drained too much battery from my phone. They're very generous with the permium currencies, but it gets repetitive after a while (to me).  If you find anything interesting let me know.  Cheers!"
AndroidGaming,3cv9dt,Noc3,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:58:35 2015 UTC,"So I've been reading comments here and downloading/trying out games myself for the last couple days. I tried Celestia: Broken Sky, Crusaders Quest and Terra Battle, and am about to try Soccer Spirits.    Out of those, I can comment that Crusaders Quest has a ton of charm, and has a pretty fun gameplay system. Terra Battle also is a ton of fun (strategy in battles), but is limited in a social aspect (no PVP, clans/guilds, global chat) so I'd recommend that if you're looking for more of a single-player experience. Fingers crossed for Soccer Spirits though, based on the comments here :)"

AndroidGaming,3cqw5b,MakinItFancy,7,Fri Jul 10 03:28:53 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this in another thread about Lifeline, but if you play through the rest of the game Taylor's tone is clearly a choice made by the game's writer. Taylor's tone changes from sarcasm to self-sufficiency - it's one of the biggest signs of character growth for them, tied with going against the choices you make for them because they've got a mind of their own."

The developers have said that Lifeline was developed using Twine ""an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories."" Give it a go. What's the worst that can happen?

If you want slow progression go with the city, if you want to blow your bloons load quickly hit up bloond td 5"

I'm willing to pay 3 to 5 dollars if game gets some improvement and is launched on play store.   Suggestions: Pinch to zoom will be really great. The text and buttons are a bit small. A place to view the info of all available units can be nice. Also I didn't really liked the movement with arrows, maybe a ""tap unit then location"" method is better. Otherwise great job on the game, looking forward to full release.   Edit: maybe add an undo option in game (limit to skirmish only?) , and I can't figure out how to move my camera in map editor"

We know that AI turn is very choppy but we are working at it (move AI to the separate thread, re think ant algorithm and so on).  The game will be on Play Store and it will get improvements. But we do not like to sell the game for fixed price. We are very pleased by our financial model right now: pay as many as you want (from 0 to infinity). This way anyone can support us while the game is still (practically) free.  About suggestions. They all very good. So good that we already have them in the roadmap :) You can check this at our trello board.  Map movement in workshop is done by right-click, something not achievable on the touch screen.

AndroidGaming,3cqhlu,Switchblade1080,2,Thu Jul 9 23:27:17 2015 UTC,"I tried the 'lite' version of the game, and It would be so much fun if you had control over either your party members or your characters upgrades.   I feel that having your new talents be random, and having your party members be random takes away from any ability to plan or prepare. at this point you might as well just give me 4 random party members  really cool concept otherwise. I like the card system  for abilities and it worked really well. So to others looking into it there's a 'lite' version you can try for free. it';s worth a look even if i didn't like it"
AndroidGaming,3cqhlu,quick_useless,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:31:17 2015 UTC,"I understand. I personally didn't mind the gameplay elements as much due to the unique implementation of the card system. I really don't like inanimate turn based combat but I enjoyed this game's art style and music so much that it just sank into me. I liked making my own character with absolutely no relevance and carve my own way into the plot with the skills I have. I was immersed into the game's universe, I mean its nothing special to be sure but it isn't shoved upon your face and its all up to your curiosity and the fact that your skills also have the potential change the game's story is a nice touch.  But I do agree that it would be better if you had control over character upgrades; but I don't think they have plans on changing that especially since the game uses Lucky Stars to reroll your skill points AND create a new character which is a load of shit. I mean don't get me wrong they don't shove it to your face but it does discourage experimentation, which is an absolute must in a game with a unique mechanic such as this."

AndroidGaming,3cnzve,Elgin_McQueen,2,Thu Jul 9 20:06:17 2015 UTC,"Anomaly Warzone Earth ran beautifully (both in terms of visuals and performance) on my old 600Mhz phone. Great game - basically reverse tower defense - cleverly adapted to touch controls, should easily run on your significantly more powerful device.  Air Control Lite is a much more simple game, but still a great time-waster.  Frozen Bubble, an old open-source classic that someone ported to Android. It's a timeless puzzle game.  Plants vs. Zombies. Another classic. Looks great, runs on any device, will keep you busy for weeks. Avoid its IAP-infested successor at all costs! This game does have IAPs, but they were added later and are not part of the original game design, as far as I know.  Minecraft Pocket Edition. Try the demo first. It scales very well and should run just fine on your device.  ScummVM allows you to play those old Lucas Arts adventure games on your phone. It doesn't come with any games, but you can e. g. purchase them on GoG. Since those games are mostly from the first half of the '90s, hardware requirements are very low.  Terry Cagangh's games are inventive, clever, minimalistic little masterpieces. Super Hexagon and VVVVVV in particular are absolutely fantastic, stand-out titles you shouldn't miss!"

Leveling is simple but highly customizable. You have 8 different attributes to spend stat points on. The Skills are a little harder to explain, you don't really start off with a lot of them to be sure. Some weapons can give you up to 2 different skills or spells while rings give you only one, but you can also loot skill books in the game world that will give you opportunities to further customize your own character. A loot system is there too.   -Different classes would be nice too.   From what I've said, there are no classes. You start off in a blank slate as a ""Novice"" of sorts with no specializations, it pretty much gives you a good starting point since you can familiarize yourself into the game's mechanics.   -Randomly generated levels and enemy variety are also features I'm looking for.   The game's universe is randomly generated, but only in the sense of how Diablo 2's overworld is randomly generated. You can also access a ""Challenge Tower"" that plays like Diablo 1 where the levels are randomly generated. The enemies are relatively varied but only exclusive to the locations you visit. You fight off living flora, skeletons, zombies, vampires, space marines, mechs, and more enemies that I haven't even looked at yet.   -Doesn't have to be a free app, but I'd prefer not to pay more than 4 or 5 bucks.   And it is. But if you're generous, you can buy an ad-free version for like...4.85 bucks that also unlocks more character sprites for you to play as.   -I also don't want something with an energy system (required resource to pay levels and once it's gone you'll have to pay or wait to pay).    There's none of that in this game.   -Also I'm playing on an S3 so I'm skeptical still of some if the nicer looking games being able to even run on my phone.    This game runs well on my 1.2 ghz Dual Core with 512 MB RAM and its smooth as butter on my 1.2 ghz Quad Core with 1 GB RAM so you're fine."
AndroidGaming,3cq9qu,Switchblade1080,3,Thu Jul 9 23:05:56 2015 UTC,Props for adressing so much with your reply. I'll give the free version a shot but it sounds promising. Are you familiar with Path of Exile? Sounds like the skill system is similar
AndroidGaming,3cq9qu,Switchblade1080,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:34:02 2015 UTC,"lol I didn't get that far in Path of Exile...I don't even remember what skills I had but I do remember playing as a Templar.  But game mechanics wise, Path of Exile uses gems to give you skills IIRC. Unfortunately this one only has skills based on the weapons you buy, but I think you can get around that if I can figure out how this game's Magic Cores are used. But it does have an ""upgrade"" system that uses materials to improve on your weapons of choice. But on the other hand you get 2 ring skill slots and 3 innate skill slots.  But there IS a weapon switch system that gives you quick access to 2 different weapons (basically the ""w"" key from Diablo 2), its one of the only ways to make a single specialization like a Full Mage viable and its an important game mechanic that should also be considered when you're making a character build.  Some of the game mechanics are weird though, particularly the magic system because if you have an offensive magic spell that's NOT bound to your weapon, it scales with your currently equipped weapon and will have all the weapon's attributes.  Oh yeah, there's a Hireling system too...and he/she is nearly just as customizable."
AndroidGaming,3cq9qu,Switchblade1080,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:51:47 2015 UTC,Is there other equipment to augment stats beyond just rings and weapons?
AndroidGaming,3cq9qu,perortico,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:01:29 2015 UTC,"Why don't I just explain the equipment system?  You have 2 weapon slots (used to be 3), 1 Armor slot, 2 ring slots, and 1 amulet slot. It all depends on what equipment you have. I don't think Armor has any base protection other than whatever bonuses it has in the description like Increased health or +10% Life Steal. Whatever it gives you is all pretty random...you know?? Just like Diablo 2??"

I would assume the market for puzzle games (reductivist, I know, but that's what people see) has really shifted away from PC. Especially considering the format of RNT, which would lovingly straddle a tablet screen, it definitely seems the primary market may be elsewhere.  That being said, I can't even fathom what a financial risk trying to port something to mobile, especially something likely to only work on tablets and necessitating a legit price point, poses for developers as of now.

AndroidGaming,3ck3ys,Jayrmz,4,Wed Jul 8 16:52:26 2015 UTC,"It seems to be based on the density in demand. If high density residential is needed and the conditions are right (water, electricity, low pollution), it will start using more squares to build larger structures."

If you can dedicate yourself to 30 and 40 minute sessions, the game is probably fun, but if you need to be able to pick it up and put it down or, God Help you, answer a call on your phone, you'll find yourself having a lot of your progress reset on a regular basis, making it a frustrating game about spinning your wheels."

AndroidGaming,3cnavd,antonyourkeyboard,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:43:43 2015 UTC,"The first one I believe requires a purchase to go beyond the beginning island, which takes ~2-3 hours.  99cents iirc, and then youve got several more hours(10+)though, so not too bad. 2 is free, but requires an online connection, which can be annoying for sone.   You can pay to have the online restriction removed, so that can be considered intrusive.  It doesn't shove premium content down your throat, or even ""teach"" you to use any premium currency, which is a plus.  I have inbuilt ad blocking, so I can't speak to ads."

AndroidGaming,3coj3n,whoamanwtf,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:33:02 2015 UTC,I'm using latest version on Motorola Moto G. I've only used  FileCommander
AndroidGaming,3coj3n,meganukebmp,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:21:17 2015 UTC,I also recommend FolderMount. Its perfect for rooted devices with very little internal memory.
AndroidGaming,3coj3n,flakingnapstich,2,Fri Jul 10 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Don't use the file commander to move game data around. Android has some built-in features for moving portions of an application or game to the SD card. The specific interface varies somewhat by Android version, but these are the general steps:  On your Android device: 1. Launch the Settings app. 2. Select ""Apps."" 3. Select an app. 4. You'll have a number of options such as clearing data and clearing the cache. If your device has an SD card slot, you will also have the option to move data to the SD card.  Applications have varying levels of support for this feature. Some games will move almost the entirety of their resource files to the SD card, while others will only move a few K. I've noticed that applications that have been moved to the SD card can sometimes falsely claim they are not installed when you try to launch them after a reboot. It can take up to half an hour after a reboot for the phone to finish recognizing these apps as being installed.  While checking one app at a time is possible, it's cumbersome. The app AppMgr III (App 2 SD) gives you a nice interface allowing you to sort applications by how big they are. It even lets you trigger bulk operations.  Another option would be to root your device and boot FROM the SD card. For example, I have an old 8GB Nook Color. Instead of using the OS on it, I boot an older release of Cyanogenmod (An open source distribution of Android) from a 16 GB SD card. While I can't really make much use of the built-in 8GB this way, it lets me run the Nook with 16GB where I have full access to 16GB without mucking around with shuffling portions of apps between the built-in 8GB and the SD card's 16GB. Given the limitations of moving data to SD card in Android, I probably get MORE use out of the SD card this way. I can use a 32GB card instead if I want more space.  Older devices can easily support up to 32GB SD cards, while some of the newer ones can supposedly make use of up to 128GB cards.  Rooting your device and booting from SD card can be a fairly complex and advanced task, depending on how much work has been put into streamlining the process for your device. It might not even BE possible to boot from SD card on your device. Some research will be necessary."
AndroidGaming,3coj3n,bakageta,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:35:07 2015 UTC,"But, when I select 'move to SD card', what happens when I reopen that app? Will it reload all of the revelant data for that app until i'm done with it, and then mve back again?   And about rooting, I'm just looking at easier options first because of how complex it is"
AndroidGaming,3coj3n,flakingnapstich,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"It moves relevant data to the sdcard in an .asec container, and reads it directly when it needs it. It won't move the entire app, and some can't be moved at all, but it helps."

So, if it stuck slightly to the side, my home screen would scroll constantly. I think the reputation just comes from selling these types of pads longer. Either way you'll probably be happy with both. I just like that the q9 has a stronger processor. I never really use the analog sticks myself, since I am mostly using for console emulation and videos, but I can see how that might affect native android games. I saw that it is very easy to replace the q9 nubs with ps3 nibs, but like I said, I will rarely use them!"

This is the ending where I picked up the abandoned humans in cryogenic sleep drifting around wrecked ship and aim for the yellow-marked planet. You will need a lot of Omegas (there's lots of barren solar system and blackholes towards the end).

Hours well spent for me.  P/s: Do inform me if this is not the subreddit for this kind of post and I will take the post down. No need to flame."
AndroidGaming,3cle1q,jonvel7,5,Wed Jul 8 20:32:24 2015 UTC,How the hell did yiu get that far with that ship?... thats my only question
AndroidGaming,3cle1q,HowlingPantherWolf,6,Thu Jul 9 00:29:15 2015 UTC,"Well I played quite a lot of the older Out There back then so I know a few tips and tricks. Throughout this Omega Edition gameplay, I had found quite a lot of old and new ships and I would say I would still stick to this new ship (the one with 3 round shapes around and have high ecosystem). Sure it has incredibly low power and resistance, but it has the biggest slot space (20 of them), I think only beaten by the round purple ship (I'm not sure so it could be wrong). Anyway, the big slot space is my strategy where I will use the slot to upgrade the ship so that it is way better than other ships with high spec but low slot space. For this ship, I would focus on upgrading its power and resistance.  Power = Solar Sail, Gravitational Well Generator, Tau Stasis, Subspace Reactor, etc.  Resistance = Shield Generator, Supra Conductor, Thermal Resonance, and the other one.  The high ecosystem is actually very good for me because at the end it is freaking hard to find a Garden Planet. I actually almost died running out of oxygen a couple of times even with high ecosystem that depletes only so little oxygen each jump. If the ecosystem is low for this ship, then I would consider making cryogenics and shared cryogenics, but it is already good so that would only take 2 precious spaces.  Even with the big slot spaces, I was always in a constant struggle on deciding what to keep or leave (Upgrading the power and resistance takes up lots of space). The rule I use is : ""Only keep the essentials"" . It means if space is an issue, I would prioritize Fuel (He, H), Shield (Fe), and Oxygen (O) first.  Towards the mid-to-end gameplay, with all the upgrades, I would usually have at least a bit of Fe for repairing broken equipments (drills, space folder, etc) and shield doesn't damage quite a lot after the many upgrades so I never have more than 1 stack of Fe at any time unless there is extra space (which almost always never happen).  I rarely keep O at the end even though it is dangerous to go around with no O supply, but I think it is worth it as the oxygen level drain so slowly and I feel like I am wasting space because O takes up space for too long without any use and then I would find a Garden Planet and regret bringing O around. Plus, Garden Planet fills up your O supply fully unlike fuel and shield so they usually last very long. In desperate times, I would use Omega.  Fuel is usually my top priority, I would have one or two stacks of fuel (He first, then H) because even with all the upgrades, they run out so quickly, and the upgrading equipments are usually hard to be repaired if they break down (requires Pt, Th, Au or some weird material I just don't have) and if they do break down, you'll be guzzling fuel like crazy. A lot of people don't know the trick to harvesting fuel. I usually go 7km, then analyse how good the outcome is. If it is a lot, then I would go 2 or 3, then 1 and 1 and 1 and 1 etc. until it depletes. If it's bad, first 7 then 1 and 1 and 1 etc. When you go 1 km deep for the fuel probe, you are using only 1 fuel count. But you will get at least 1 H (which fills up 2 fuel count). So you are getting a profit of 1 fuel count everytime you do that. I repeat the 1km probe launching until there is no more to harvest. It doesn't seem like much but trust me, it worth every tonne of that fuel. Also, since the beginning of the game, you'd want to get good resistance (Shield Generator and at least 1 more upgrade, 2 will be nice) and Ultraprobe as soon as possible. These 2 will allow you to harvest fuel from the star itself. Star does a lot of damage so you'd want a good resistance for that and Ultraprobe will allow you to probe launch into the star. Even with 2 resistance upgrades, I still don't go into Neutron Star unless I absolutely have to. And Supernova is just a no-no for me. Anyway, the ability to harvest from the star itself (which is usually way more abundant that Gas Giant, especially after the attack which might be inhabited by enemies) is a super advantage and even using the Ultraprobe at a Gas Giant increases the fuel yield so definitely go for it.  For my ship, I would get the following upgrades (somewhat according to priority, varies with situation)   Interplanetary reactor Drill Hydrogen Probe Space Folder Telescope Power upgrades = Subspace reactor, Solar Sail, Gravitational Well Generator, Tau Stasis (try to upgrade both for interplanetary [that says requires Interplanetary Reactor] and interstellar [that says requires Space Folder] Shield Generator, then the upgrades = Thermal Resonance, Supra Conductor and the other one. Ultraprobe   This is usually good enough for you to go around and survive for long enough.  Not necessary but maybe worth the slot space at times:   Advanced Telescope (or whatever it is called) - have higher telescope range Inferometer - allows you to know what planets there are in any system within your telescope range, useful when planning your route on branching system paths.   You can get away without it but I had it for a while but never hesitated to break them down for space if I need to (actually applies for everything in desperate times).  Things I never used because I feel like it is a waste of space (maybe I'll have them if I have more than 30 slot spaces, which never happens):   Cryogenics (therefore also Shared Cryogenics) - The ship has good ecosystem already (9/10) and even with decent (maybe 6 or 7/10) I would still not take these upgrades Ansible - Allows you to see if there are enemies occupying at least one planet on any system within your telescope range. No point knowing if there are enemies at a system if you cannot know whether they are occupying all of the planets, or only one you don't want to go to (like Rocky at times), or that one you desperately want to go to (like Gas Giant) at least for the older edition, where it shows you - yes or no - there are enemies at the system (if with the inferometer), not on what planets they are on until you actually warp there (which is the same as not having them at all). Unless there is bigger advantage after the Omega Edition update (which I have not checked yet), this is usually utterly useless.   The rest of the upgrades are also usually never used by me unless I have to, like the Wormhole Generator and Life Seed at the very end (last 2 jumps) for the yellow marked planet.  To summarise my strategy,   Go for high space slot ship, (and use the space to upgrade its weaknesses) Keep essentials only (drop the Pt, Th or any other tempting material for fuel, Fe and oxygen supply priorities) Stockpile as many Omegas as you can and use them only when you really need to   The rest of the gameplay is usually also determined by luck but there is control (to a certain extent) on how you can change your luck and stay safe long enough. Sorry for the wall of text. If you have any other questions, fire away. Cheers.

No you don't need take all of them (and it's highly improbable that you'll survive with whatever little space slots you have left if you do). But the more you can bring to the final planet (yellow marked), the more points you'll get, assuming you can actually get to the end.  I took 3 stacks of them at first, feeling so bad that I have leave the rest to die (at least they'll die in peace, in their sleep). But I felt even worse later on when I had no choice but to leave the two stacks I took with me (1 on Rocky, 1 on Gas Giant) to make space for my essentials. :("

AndroidGaming,3codra,Lokomotivewest,7,Thu Jul 9 14:00:15 2015 UTC,"Well, this is /r/AndroidGaming so I'm biased when I say stick to android. On the more logical points side, I'd say it's not an entirely valid reason to jump ship.  Curated - Higher quality games tend to make it into Curated's list, which means that most of what you find on the list are good games that aren't junky. While in no way a replacement to the Play Store it can help make navigating it much easier.  /r/AndroidGaming - Out of however many people there are here, someone's bound to find an answer. I could probably spend a few days months just browsing through lists of recommended games.  Other Sources - Yes, I'll admit it. The Play Store is something of a nightmare and sometimes you just can't find what you're looking for. That's where other stores come in, like Humble Bundle (despite all their flaws) and the Amazon App store. Humble's selection of games aren't bad (if there's ever a bundle in which something is F2P, purchasing it gives you the premium all-IAPs unlocked version), even if it's rather small. Amazon, well, let's just say I've got a backlog of 200+ apps I got for free (including some greats like Monument Valley and Terraria).  Emulators - I mean really, let me see here. Android games, PSP games, DS games, GBA games, Atari games, SNES games, Hopefully-Soon PS2 games. Nothing quite like playing Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron for the PSP on your phone, even more so if you're techie enough to setup the multiplayer component. I've spent the greater part of a year finding good PSP games that'll run and I've only just finished. I dare say that most PSP games (since I'm familiar with emulating them the most) are of a higher quality experience, and length, than your average mobile game. Star Wars Battlefront trumps Crossy Road in my book any day.  Is it true that devs are delaying or not even releasing android versions? Yeah, I'll say that is true in some cases unfortunately. I'm sure that if enough of us got on the horns at devs that they'd start paying more attention to android though. But on the flip side I'd say that I'm not very concerned. Between Amazon's Free App of the Day, Humble Bundles, and Emulators I've got more than enough stuff to take up my time until Fallout Shelter arrives (and then some).  TL;DR; It's a valid worry when taken by itself but when you factor everything else in, it's rather small."
AndroidGaming,3codra,InTheShadows0,2,Thu Jul 9 14:33:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks, this is a really informative comment. I'm probably going to go with the s6 edge. I always have these doubts when it comes to getting a new phone."

AndroidGaming,3codra,rube,4,Sat Jul 11 02:45:41 2015 UTC,"Don't use the Play Store to find new games and you'll be fine.  I use Android Police and this subreddit to find new games, and I find plenty.  There are still many games that come to iOS before Android.  But most of those seem to have a gap of a month or two now, instead of a year as they once were.  The major benefit you get with Android is the easy access and use off emulators.  But I know they're not for everyone.  I personal would never go back to iOS due to the need for iTunes to do any sort of PC transferring, but that's just me.    TLDR  Android gaming is quite healthy, regardless of the state of the Play Store listings."
AndroidGaming,3codra,sarxion,2,Thu Jul 9 14:32:49 2015 UTC,"I develop for both platforms, and I have to admit, I've sadly seen a trend where the biggest titles land on iOS first, or sometimes don't even make it on android. Proof of this is Bioshock for iOS and none for android, as well as Vainglory, the best mobile Moba to date which took a while to land on android. iOS gaming imo is of much higher quality overall, however, expect a big price jump even for indie games on iOS. The thing is, iOS is way more profitable per user, and costs less to develop since you only have to test it on a handful of devices.   However... Like others have said, android's emulation capabilities without root are a huge plus, so of you are into it, it well makes up for the game quality.   Also, please don't get the S6, specially if you are comparing it to the iPhone, because Samsung is the complete opposite of smoothness. Get a stock android device. The Moto X 3rd gen is coming out soon, as well as the OnePlus 2. Other alternatives include the Nexus 6 and Droid Turbo"

You can get some nice N64 games (Mupen64AE alpha), or some Dreamcast ones (Reicast - look for alpha builds) in almost any newish phone. Dreamcast got some awesome RPGs, like Grandia, Skies of Arcadia, and Shenmue. Also, PSP can be emulated on PPSSPP (runs awesome even on a Nexus 4), PSP got RPGs on par (albeit in higher numbers) to two aforementioned consoles (take a look on some ""25 best"" list - too many to write here).  If you haven't played Knights of the Old Republic (Star Wars Bioware RPG) I would suggest that - it's a native Android port with controller support."

AndroidGaming,3cf6jk,cdnutter,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:03:55 2015 UTC,"I remember now that apparently they want to minimise updates to avoid splitting the players, which is why it has loads of extra permissions. Presumably if it's intended to be monetised then IAPs would be included in that?"

AndroidGaming,3cf6jk,Avamander,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:22:07 2015 UTC,"Run at startup is the only douchebaggy permission there for a game.  I'd kill that permission before I even launch the game once.   Network access, view wifi, etc. - Serve ads. Retrieve apps/run at startup - Only suspect permission, IMO.  This is usually so they can send you unsolicited notifications ""hurr durr come back and play our game."" Vibration/prevent sleeping - Standard game stuff Read phone status - Handle situations like an incoming phone call while the game is running. Approximate location - More ad stuff.  This lets the ad companies figure out what sort of regional ads, what sort of demographics use the app and what they should show etc. Modify/delete/storage access - save game type stuff?  I have no idea what the game is.  Just looking at the store description.. maybe it downloads more textures/graphic stuff/easter eggs over HTTP? This sounds super nefarious, and maybe it actually can be, I don't know.  Its a super common permission though.  A good way to instantly ruin your reputation, permanently, is to mess with people's devices.  Personally, this is an acceptable permission for anything that isn't ""Joe Cool's Awesome App"" with <1k downloads. Google play billing/data/network - standard for IAP   So nothing really out of the ordinary, other than ""run at startup"" which it has absolutely no business doing, but you can easily disable that.  I'd also disable locations, because fuck ad providers.  They may use it to detect your country ""hurr durr you ate a guy from germany!"" but usually there is a fallback to geo ip lookup.   I've never had an issue turning those two permissions off and I do it all the time."
AndroidGaming,3cf6jk,ClippingMinis,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:41:07 2015 UTC,"You're pretty on the money when it comes to why we ask each of those permissions.   Retrieve apps/run at startup - This is for notifications before the user starts up the app yes.  Modify/delete/storage access - This is because we download new skins on the fly. This allows us to add new skins to the game without having to release a new update for it.  You can disable these of course, but if you do, please be mindful that the game might become unstable and crash."

It's a fully fledged Android/iOS/Desktop MMO, that focuses on resource acquisition and high-risk PvP in a fully moldable world. So, for example, your role in a guild could be being a caravan guard, who gets paid to protect the guy hauling aaaall your expensive guild resources from one port to another. Or you could be the guy on the caravan. Or you could be a highwayman who purposely attacks these caravans. Or you could be the farmer who farmed all these goods everyone wants to begin with. It's totally open ended and highly strategy based, even in its unfinished form I've really been enjoying it."
AndroidGaming,3cj2jj,Mik0ri,2,Wed Jul 8 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"Would be nice to have one, even if it was a buy to play instead of a free to play I would invest in buying if there was one.  Not to slam the Albion mention but that game is MMORPG that is 90% PVP and has an open loot system like old school Ultima Online.  Completely different from a real strategy game and completely dominated by zerging clans."

The only thing I might suggest is that you maybe slow down the first maybe 10 - 15 platforms and gradually increase their speed as you work your farther into the game.

I'd suggest slowing it down in the beginning.  I think that will help keep your users addicted and wanting to play more and more if they are able to feel a sense of success by passing at least 10 platforms at a low to medium difficulty.

AndroidGaming,3cfeqa,sr1v3r,2,Wed Jul 8 07:28:45 2015 UTC,"It's quite easy for the NST. And all of the apps that manage root (superuser) only grant root access to other apps through a whitelist or asking you to confirm when the app tries to use root access. You can limit it to just GLTools and that'll be that.  But I totally respect not jumping into rooting if you don't want to. Stuff like rooting, moddig, and so forth should only be undertaken if you've read and understood what's being done and the possible consequences (and how to deal with them). That's not for everyone.  But if you did want to do it, you don't need to be tech savvy for the NST.   Here is the root guide on XDA. If you only want root (which is all you need for GLTools), you only need to follow steps 1-3. Basically, allow unknown sources, download TowelRoot (get the version for the NST, obviously), install it, open TowelRoot and click ""Make it rain"", the device should reboot and then you can install SuperSU from the play store. Tada, you're rooted."

It's just yet another bandwagon which has gained enough inertia that some people need to hop on to avoid being criticised. I liked kairosoft games years ago, I like them now. Some are great, some are average, some suck a bit. Ultimately all that matters is whether you enjoy them or not, rather than whether other people think a level of similarity from game to game is automatically a bad thing."

I played it for almost a year before burning out, and I was checking in on it all. the. time.  Now I'm playing Crusaders Quest and it's gobbling up a ridiculous amount of my time.  I've been playing it for..4 or 5 months now, and I probably log in at least 4 hours total each day, in either small 5 minute increments or when I get home at night and use up all of my currencies and do the daily dungeon-y thing. (if all of my resources are full when I sit down, and I do the daily dungeon thing and burn everything out I usually get about an hour and a half of playtime before I run out, maybe 45 mins to a hour if I do World Boss runs)  It's really polished and really fun and really fair for f2p folks (I've been throwing $10.00 a month at it for the past 4 months...)  linkme: Crusaders Quest"

AndroidGaming,3cc192,CleveRoh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:53:34 2015 UTC,I was able to max my second sneak 3 weeks ago and got them both pretty-close-to perfect weapons to go along with my max Susanoo with another really good weapon and it's been easy street to top 5% ever since.    I think I'm playing it because it scratches my addiction to grind that I've been fighting since my EQ days.  Slowly but surely I get more and more 6* heroes that I don't really need because sneak/sneak/anything clears any stage on hard mode.  I haven't cleared Tundra past normal 5-13 to get Dionne because I don't want the repeatables in my list. I can beat the first 9 stages of FoS reliably (still haven't beaten FoS 10).  I have one good SBW and it's Leons (bleh.)  But I still log in day after day and merrily grind my gold and bread and heroes...

AndroidGaming,3cc192,CleveRoh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:44:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think it's the best idea to use gems for gold...I use mine like 95% for contracts probably and the other 5% for meat refills when I'm bored and just want to play.  I think if you just want gold you get a much better return on your gems using them for meat and doing quests or just levels (plus you get exp).  Once I got my legendaries I've only done the 5 keys / 2200 gold dungeon levels, and it adds up pretty fast, then just bread dungeon each week.  That keeps me a little over one 6* per week which is fine.   The thing I've lacking right now is Iron to upgrade SBWs, there's really no good way to accumulate that, it all sucks."

AndroidGaming,3cc192,ScubaGibs,3,Tue Jul 7 02:44:00 2015 UTC,"MMO - Dawn of the Dragons   I've yet to ever see it mentioned on here, but I play an mmo called Dawn of the Dragons daily for at least 15-20 mins.  The thing that makes it so wonderful is it is not at all like other MMOs. It doesn't have 3d graphics and you don't have to level up and compete with/against a team.  The way raiding works, for example, is you use your stamina to attack a static picture of a boss. As the health depletes (say %s) the picture changes. The pictuers can look like hand drawn paintings and some are gorgeous. A dragon raid might have the dragon sleeping in a pile of gold at 100%, show him starting to awaken at 80%, show him breathing fire at 50%, show him bleeding and wounded at 10%, etc  Each boss has a loot table with tiers. So even a lowbie gets loot for doing at least 1000 damage, while the heavy hitters who've been playing a while get a chance at more loot for hitting higher tiers like 1m or even 10b.  Despite having a resource system (actually 3 with energy - questing, stamina - raiding, honor - guild raids), and letting you pay to refill it, IT IS NOT AT ALL NEEDED nor encouraged. There's literally no reason to. Here's why.  The game simply has no level cap. You can level to infinity. I've been playing since Oct and am about to be level 1000, while the highest level player just reached 10,000.   Levels are meaningless, the real power comes from collecting.  Are you an RPG gamer who likes to collect? Do you finish save files with one of every item, weapon, armor, etc in your inventory? You'd love this game.  You have a ""legion"", which you outfit with troops and generals that you collect as loot rewards from raids (along with gear and other stuff). Each (I have hundreds of different ones) has their own att/def and special abilities. You collect legions with different abilties (say Legion 1 can have 10 generals and 50 troops while Legion 2 can have 15 Generals but only 30 troops) and you outfit them accordingly, mixing and matching troops/generals to get the most Legion Power possible which directly affedts how much damage you do to a raid.  This can switch up when new content is introduced as well. For example, I had these things called Clockwork Whelps that I never used. A new general was put into the game that gained tons of power for each clockwork whelp used, so I spent some time farming more and reoutfitting my legion to take advantage of this new general I had gotten. This happens fairly often and is a lot of fun as you mix and match troops/generals to see how much legion power you can squeeze out. One general might buff all merfolks in your legion making a crappy merfolk troop you didnt use suddenly valuable. One legion might only allow 3 strength based generals and 3 wisdom so you cant use your favorite Agility general, but maybe with the right combiation of troops this legion will come out ahead. Play around!  It sounds overly complicated maybe but its absolutely not. It's a lot of fun and a F2P mmo done right. I love it. Every Wed. and Fri. at Noon the Devs summon a special world raid that all players in the world beat up on with good rewards for the different tiers.  Oh yea the collecting. A whole lot of the best gear/troops/generals in the game scale based off of your collection. So you'll have a general that says ""Gains 5 att/def for every unique troop you own"" or ""Gains 25 att for every 3 unique weapons you own""  This really encourages you to go back and farm old easy raids with low tiers as well as push hard for the high tiers on new raids to collect one of everything so your collection and thus your power grows.  if anyone picks it up, it's free and I've never spent a dime or felt inclined to. Hit me up with any questions."

Like if I'm playing Clash of Clans, letting me know when a building's complete or something is fine if it's at the point where it takes days to complete.  However, when Crossy Road or something else is reminding me I have coins every three seconds, you know your app has a problem."
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,PotFarm,8,Tue Jul 7 16:28:55 2015 UTC,A. No question about it. I'd rather not have an IAP that encourages continuous spending.
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,anonymous-bot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:33:13 2015 UTC,Great response. I appreciate the feedback.
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,aldikiller,3,Tue Jul 7 17:17:44 2015 UTC,A. B isn't that big of a problem as long as there isn't something like you can only buy this if you spend real money or that you can only play 5 times and then you have to wait.
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,Mik0ri,3,Tue Jul 7 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"A is perfect, B is awful. Everyone wants to feel like they actually own a part of the game from their purchase, not that they're frivolously renting buffs. Plus, most people here have more than one Android device or plan to switch to yet another Android when theirs is dead, and in situations like those, still having your permanent purchases in your games is extremely important."
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,anonymous-bot,2,Tue Jul 7 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"Great point. On the device switching subject, what has been the easiest transition? Which game have you found the most ease in moving from one device to another? Ours right now is attached to Facebook ID's, which has caused a lot of problems, and more work for our support team in the long run."
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,NonConGuy,3,Tue Jul 7 17:20:12 2015 UTC,What about attaching it to the users Google account? I believe non-consumable IAP can be attached to the Google account so that it goes with you between devices. Also if you use Google Play Games then take a look at using the Saved Games API.
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,krimsonstudios,2,Tue Jul 7 17:43:13 2015 UTC,My personal favorites are VIP system where you buy currency but also get bonuses based on how much you already spent in the game. Good example would be heroes charge which imo had the best currency system. Also a big fan of pay for daily login bonus where you spend some money to get x amount of currency a day. In the end it is much more efficient to buy the daily login special than buying bulk currency and also makes them want to keep playing for login bonus. Again look at heroes charge.
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,EastSideGames,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:36:14 2015 UTC,I spent a lot of time in Heroes Charge and really enjoyed the concept of pay X and get Y daily for a month. Almost like a premium currency subscription.   Thanks for your comment!
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,anthonyvardiz,2,Tue Jul 7 17:09:06 2015 UTC,Temporary boosts get absolutely $0 from me. I am willing to spend a bit of $ into IAP's if I feel there is some sort of long term value from that investment.

AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,G-Solutions,2,Wed Jul 8 16:48:41 2015 UTC,"I've given up on games that attempt to use B to gain a leg-up. It's just an easy way for developers to ""force"" people to pay in order to unlock content that is required.  At least A gives you a reason to actually upgrade since you know you'll always have that bonus. It may result in less money short-term, but it'll be much easier to keep your user base and grow it long-term."
AndroidGaming,3cfwjm,_pelya,2,Tue Jul 7 21:29:25 2015 UTC,"A) It has to be permanent. Preverable more content, not just bigger numbers"

The games are Magic Rampage, Prince of Persia Shadow&Flame, and Megatroid (and I probably would agree if you tell me Megatroid requires IAP for the final boss).   And countless games where it is abused to force you to pay $100 for slightly less shitty gameplay."

AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,manfredmaniek,13,Mon Jul 6 09:12:20 2015 UTC,That's a pretty racist title.
AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,Blinkroot,7,Mon Jul 6 09:34:08 2015 UTC,"Makes you think the tutorial will say something like "" swipe up to clutch purse tighter""."
AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,RadioactiveCorndog,4,Mon Jul 6 11:02:50 2015 UTC,"The title may SOUND racist, but it definitely ISN'T racist, because the game has no real world references whatsoever, so saying it is racist just because there is a colour in the title is an exaggeration.  By the way we thought of another title, but we couldn't find anything that was this catchy and described the mechanics of the game with such precission."
AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,Brarsh,9,Mon Jul 6 11:31:01 2015 UTC,"Just keep the title if you like it and it accurately describes the game.  The color black shouldn't be banned from speech just because people are scared of possible racism, which this clearly isn't.  If that's the first thing their mind goes to that's their fault, not yours.  Also, from your description in the play store I'd make the assumption that English isn't your first language. That being said, the phrasing might not mean anything to you, but others might draw significance to ""the black"", which in segregationist America was used to marginalize a particular group...  Just a quick FYI."
AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,o0joshua0o,0,Mon Jul 6 12:39:56 2015 UTC,Can you palette swap to a color different from black? Or use a different descriptor for the pieces to be avoided?

AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,kurtman,2,Mon Jul 6 16:04:01 2015 UTC,"Be prepared. About to give some feedback on something other than the title.   The gameplay is fast, the addition of powerups is what I feel separate it from wave wave and other twitch games. The look is very polished as well. Good job. Would pay probably up to 2dollars for this had it been a paid game."
AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,kurtman,2,Mon Jul 6 14:12:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the feedback.  The problem with paid games is that when you come with your first game nobody wants to buy it, because it's totally unproven ;)."
AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,Ivysaurous,2,Mon Jul 6 14:17:19 2015 UTC,Good point. Makes sense. Seriously though the color schemes with material like design really looks good. Makes it look very professional.

I'd consider making the screen inactive until the animation is complete, or simply adding a screen in between."
AndroidGaming,3ca8nl,Evil_Vagina,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:37:28 2015 UTC,I like the game but it seems like if you stay near the edges it's a lot easier. Also I think the exit button is slightly annoying. Otherwise it's a great game.

It just took to long and now everyone is all jaded and couldn't care less. I'm sure it will do well, but it seems to me android Fallout fans are already sick of hearing about this title. They should never of made it a timed exclusive.  Edited for the English teacher in the room."
AndroidGaming,3c77tl,GeistMD,2,Sun Jul 5 16:19:09 2015 UTC,Does anyone ever think that things come out later for Android because of the work needed to support tons of devices with proper optimization? Or they they are adding amazing things to it? Why ya'll gotta be so darn pessimistic?
AndroidGaming,3c77tl,Neomeir,2,Mon Jul 6 16:01:15 2015 UTC,If they had wanted both versions out at the same time they could have. And releasing it the same day as the FO4 reveal shows they were definitely thinking a head about release dates. Hence the only true conclusion one can come to is it was obviously a timed exclusive.
AndroidGaming,3c77tl,GeistMD,10,Mon Jul 6 17:04:51 2015 UTC,"You meant ""couldn't care less"". If you COULD care less then you do care about it, if you CAN'T care less then that means you don't care about it. Sorry"

AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,RoryMcK,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:04:47 2015 UTC,"I upgraded a few months ago to the G3, and have been thouroughly satisfied with it. The screen is just gorgeous on this thing. It is exactly as big as it can be while fitting comfortably in a pants pocket, and the resolution is larger than most games actually use. It still manages to feel like a phone, rather than a phablet. Battery life is solid, and it charges quickly. The stock OS includes some really nice features (like the option to force full screen mode; fantastic for games) while not feeling too weighed down with bloatware.  I occasionally use it for phone calls, but spend far more time gaming on this thing. I have nothing bad to say about it at all."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,TrueGnosys,2,Tue Jul 7 03:15:51 2015 UTC,I completely understand what you mean about it fitting in your pocket perfectly. That was my biggest worry when I was buying it

AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,G-Solutions,2,Mon Jul 6 07:29:48 2015 UTC,I'm waiting for a Note 5 myself since I'm in no hurry to buy and love what I've read about the Note 4.   The guy above mentioned a 4k screen on the Note 5 but my understanding is that nothing is official and all info about the Note 5 is just speculation. But they have a history of putting top notch hardware in Note's and charge a very very high price to start with.   The LG G4 and Nexus 6 were the only other alternatives I considered and decided to wait.  Also it's worth considering if an android tablet will do what you want.....just a thought.
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,PanzerSwag,2,Mon Jul 6 14:00:00 2015 UTC,"I mean depends in how you can afford to wait really. Note 4 is more than you need already, so only wait for the 5 if you can afford to."

AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,LordSpaghetti,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:28:34 2015 UTC,"Check out /r/EmulationOnAndroid! We'd be happy to help over there. And be sure to read the wiki, I've linked most common emulators there (still missing stuff for Neo Geo, Sega Saturn, and Atari Jaguar, but otherwise it's close to complete).  What are your requirements? As in, what systems would you like to emulate, and how big or small would you like to go in terms of screen size? Depending on your answers, a different phone, or potentially even a tablet might be a viable solution."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,tomkatt,2,Mon Jul 6 18:25:33 2015 UTC,"Just mentioning a HUGE detail everyone seems to be missing on. If you can, get a phone with a 1080p screen, not a QHD (which sadly almost every flagship has right now) . This is because more pixels mean a more powerful GPU is required to render it, and GPUs on smartphones haven advanced enough to even compensate on this. For context, a 1080p has to render about 2 million pixels, while a QHD display has to render 3.6 million (this means you need a 60% more powerful GPU to render the qhd screen at the same frame rate as the 1080p one). This also applies to emulation, unless you downscale the rendering, which almost always means a performance loss as well. The dream gaming phone would be a snapdragon 808 with a 1080p screen... However, good luck with finding one."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,sarxion,4,Mon Jul 6 13:43:11 2015 UTC,"Yep, I agree with you. The Oneplus One would probably be the best option: the SoC still runs everything you throw at it, it has a huge display but at only 1080p, huge battery and 3gb of RAM."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,tomkatt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:01:57 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of 720p for Android devices smaller than 8-10"". Seems to be the sweet spot for good emulation.  My emulation/gaming tablet right now is a HP Slate 7 Extreme and has run everything I've thrown at it. It was an amazing deal for only $90."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,sarxion,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:28:00 2015 UTC,"Me too, the problem with 720p displays is they tend to come in non-high end hardware. A 720p and a snapdragon 808/805 or heck, a tegra processor would be the holy grail of emulation."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,tomkatt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"Slate 7 Extreme or Tegra Note 7 then (they're basically the same). Tegra 4 quad core @ 1.8GHz at 720p. I bought the Slate recently and it was a steal, just a fantastic tablet for dirt cheap. Only drawback is that the Slate only has 1GB of RAM, but it doesn't seem to have been a detriment, it's snappy fast, and has emulated everything I've thrown at it including PSP and Dreamcast."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,sarxion,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:33:08 2015 UTC,"Damm... I completely missed this, I'll definitely check this out, even more so considering its 90 dollars on Amazon right now. Have you tried running monster Hunter portable 3rd? Or metal gear peace Walker? Both PSP tiles. 60fps without issues?"
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,tomkatt,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:45:25 2015 UTC,"I haven't tried those. The most intensive game I've played has been Madden 2012, which strains the limits of the thing, and requires a bit of frameskip. It's confusing though, since the game seems to have a variable framerate, and at times states it's running at 15/30 fps but reports that to be 100% speed, so I'm not sure, it could be it actually taxed out the original hardware.  Here are the settings I've used to get Madden 12 running butter smooth at 2x psp resolution, and native display scaling.  Every other game I've tried has run full speed without frameskip at 1x psp resolution, and most have run full speed without frameskip, or with minimal frameskip at 2x PSP resolution (Guilty Gear XX ^Core was an exception, and struggled at 49-50/60 dips without frameskip at 2x).  I don't have portable 3rd but I do have Freedom Unite on the tablet. I'll test it out later tonight if I have time and let you know how it runs."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,sarxion,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:56:31 2015 UTC,"Monster Hunter freedom unite is known to run without much issue. I was wondering on the other 2 because metal gear is known to be barely runnable on most current hardware. My Moto X with the snapdragon 801 runs it at about 15 fps/30 or less, and monster Hunter portable 3rd (English patched version) runs barely at 45/60fps, and in a lot of stages drops to 30fps. If you have any luck with any of those let me know. It's still surprising how the Slate came at least 2 years ago and still holds up emulation wise."
AndroidGaming,3c9tbf,FieldzSOOGood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:15:27 2015 UTC,"Well, the Tegra 4 is pretty comparable to the Snapdragon 800 series, and specificially on par with the Snapdragon 801, so I wouldn't expect any miracles. Only drawback is the T4 only runs GLES 2.0, not sure about the snapdragon. GLES 3 would be nice, but isn't generally needed for emulation (though newer ones like Play! and Dolphin are using it I think).  Here's a bunch of benchmarks comparing the Tegra K1, Tegra 4, and Snapdragon 801.  The T4 and the SD801 are pretty comparable, with one or the other edging out in various benchmark comparisons. It is impressive the Tegra holds up so well against it, given the lower clock speed. I don't think the T4 can go above 2.0GHz given the associated heat issues with it, but with a good cooling solution and an overclock I'd love to see what it could do.  All told though, it sounds like if you really want to run MHp3rd or Peace Walker, you're gonna need the Nvidia Shield Tablet with the Tegra K1 or something equivalent. Whatever it is, it won't be cheap. :P"

Well, my friend has the S6 and we did. Despite the S6's clearly superior hardware and GPU, it ran everything at the same level as even the snapdragon 801 on my Moto X. This wouldn't be the case if the S6 had a 1080p display, and instead of running things at the same speed or even worse, would be much faster and smoother."

AndroidGaming,3c8syo,RovingSquid,2,Sun Jul 5 23:43:30 2015 UTC,What do employees do?
AndroidGaming,3c8syo,Pooptown_LLC,3,Mon Jul 6 18:04:25 2015 UTC,"We're working on updating the tutorial right now to better explain their mechanic, but for a quick overview:  staff basically effects property income. If you don't have all the required staff, the property sliders for maintenance and management will slowly go down, to a minimum of basically the percentage of required employees - ~5% (so, if you have 50% of required employees the slider will bottom out at ~45%). This reduces the income the property makes by that much. If you hire up to full, the sliders will slowly go back up. From a strategy perspective, you'd always want to keep all required employees, and early on this is easy to do, but employees costs go up exponentially (similar to the way property costs do) so later in the game, employee cost will become a much bigger factor, and will potentially out cost their benefit, making it worthwhile for instance to keep some of the properties at only 80% full  (particularly with the higher end properties that take a ton of employees to keep full)."

AndroidGaming,3c8syo,TrackieDaks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:45:40 2015 UTC,"Been playing this since I found this post and I have the following for you.   Parking Garages seem to be underpowered. At this moment in time with a x568.70 income multiplier, my 441 Parking Garages are making me $293.532 Quadrillion a month. Meanwhile, my 404 Small Apartments are making me $377.096 Quintillion a month. Hell, my 355 Duplex's make me $4.914 Quintillion . It feels like it falls into the same incremental game trap of 'Play until it takes ages to upgrade then reset and start again'. I have no idea how long it's supposed to take until I can get to 5000 High Rise Condo's but all I can assume is MONTHS. I have noticed some lag on my device, a Google Nexus 4. It's not horrendous but it just means that changing from say Portfolio to Research seems sluggish.   It's not all doom and gloom though.   The Short Sale Bonus is done well. Optional ad for a 6 hour double speed bonus? Count me in. Follows the Cookie Clicker idea with the Brokers being the Heavenly Chips equivalent."
AndroidGaming,3c8syo,pastarific,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:05:38 2015 UTC,"We're working on doing some balance this week, but with Parking Garages, notice that though they make less than most other properties, when you upgrade them to a bonus level, they effect ALL properties, not just themselves. (so for instance, 50 of them gives 1.5x profit to ALL properties, which ends up being a huge bonus).  Duplexes are similar in that they effect other property types, but only 1 type per award level.  Also, yes, 5000 of a property is a very long term goal...  We're hoping to add some more end game research and bonuses once lower level balance is a little more stable."

It's probably the closest in terms of gameplay.  Also has some of the best music I've heard in a mobile game, but that isn't relevant :)  Dragon Blaze is another option if you can get past the grinding.  Brave Brigade: Hero Summoner has some similarities, but I never got too into that one so I'm not sure how it holds up once you really get into it.  Unison League also has some gameplay similarities, similar to Brave Brigade I never really got into it.  Still probably missing one or two but those are the ones that come to mind."

AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,Awilen,4,Sun Jul 5 09:08:37 2015 UTC,I just started it again to see the other choices so far I'm loving it
AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,GeodesicGnome,5,Sun Jul 5 09:27:53 2015 UTC,"If it had better writing I'd be interested, but the sarcasm was so thick Taylor didn't even seem like a real character. Very juvenile writing."
AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,rillip,9,Mon Jul 6 15:30:12 2015 UTC,"Alright. So this is a text-based game. Which means the scenario is the one thing that the writer can't screw up. And I have one, huge, MAJOR gripe with the scenario.  Taylor doesn't show any sense of urgency.  ""Here I am. My ship blew up. I got in a safepod. Crashed on an unknown planet that miraculously has breathable air. I don't have any survival skill. No water, no food, no nothing. And I then proceed to crack sarcastic jokes at the first person I get in contact with, while my life is at stake !! But that's ok.""  Why ?  Not that I'm not enjoying the game, I'm still waiting for Taylor's next input right now. But this part of the character really detaches it from the scenery."
AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,Jay_Burd,13,Sun Jul 5 17:38:45 2015 UTC,"Why ?   Not everyone copes with a crisis the same way. Sometimes people deflect with humor until they manage to get their head screwed on tight. I actually think writing Taylor in a defeated, dismissive manner helps a lot towards the later half of the game, because when they start taking charge and making decisions on their own against your suggestions, they start becoming independent, fleshed out people.  Honestly, I feel like if I ended up stranded on some alien planet and the only contact I had was with someone who was of no help other than for conversation, I'd probably crack a joke for the morale boost more than anything."
AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,Cleanfel,3,Mon Jul 6 06:21:19 2015 UTC,So I just told Taylor to go sleep near the reactor. How fucked is she?

AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,Wiccy,3,Mon Jul 6 16:53:04 2015 UTC,There are times where Taylor is busy walking or napping..  And you literally can't do anything.  So the notifications tell you when you have another transmission.

I haven't seen any mention of it online. Before the rescuer punches him to ""knock him out of it"",  we get some direct alien text describing the purpose of the parasite and it's ultimate goal.

AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,Blazingscourge,5,Tue Jul 7 05:36:10 2015 UTC,"Welp couldn't find anything so extra long warning thing then.  SPOILERS BELOW  SPOILERS BELOW  SPOILERS BELOW  SPOILERS BELOW  SPOILERS BELOW  Basically, something happened in my playthrough in the peak cave where the ship's crew showed up with the aliens inside of them and tried to get one down Taylor's throat. And after staring at them for a bit he kind of accepted what was about to happen to him for a moment before I snapped him out of it. So it seems like staring into their glowing green eyes can give some kind of hypnotic effect."
AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,GeodesicGnome,5,Tue Jul 7 05:56:46 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I got that same thing! So you think from staring at all the green eyes while taylor was running towards the ship they were hypnotized into saying that stuff to the rescuers?   I thought that since Taylor did acknowledge spitting green that the alien had successfully invaded him. But then again the alien comrades do try to place the alien down Taylor's throat, it would suggest an alien vacancy.   Due to my hypothesis,  I played until I got the ending where Taylor blew up the planet with themselves on it, figuring that was safest for the universe.   Oops,  sorry Taylor."
AndroidGaming,3c5i5i,ScubaGibs,3,Tue Jul 7 06:02:18 2015 UTC,"Yep I was guessing from staring at all the eyes it ended up trying the hypnotic thing on him again. Especially since there were what, millions of eyes for him to look at instead of four or five? So more chances for their plan to work out, pretty sure that punch saved him.  And I honestly just assumed the green he was spitting was from biting down on the alien as a reflex when it tried to crawl into his mouth or something? And that its blood or ""juices"" or whatever was inside it got left behind a bit. Nothing to really support that one but eh it was the first thing I thought of since they still wanted to put an alien in there.  And rip NaMg's Taylor"

The big downside is a very strict stamina system (it doesn't even recharge when you level). Aside from that, they give you a ton of premium currency by just playing. The gameplay is really fun and fast, a match 3, 4, or 5 system with combos (match 4, then 3, to unleash a special attack), or match 5 to place a special block on the map which either moves your character, attacks, heals, blocks, or charges your fury bar.

Constant upgrading with no real payoff and relentless pressure to grind or spend money to advance are problems, but for me the worst aspect is that there's just no consequence or depth at all to the game.  You get attacked... so what.  Nothing happens of any consequence.  The allies have no real function as there is no geography, no coordination, no long term struggles of any kind.  The whole game is just a long series of upgrades with no real pay off at any point.  I liked it at first but now a couple weeks in it makes me want to throw my tablet away."

At that point all the upgrades get so expensive that one has to spend hours attacking other players just to pay for one, there's just no way to get the resources needed otherwise... without paying of course.

I played for 15 mins and then it was telling me I had to wait or pay $$ to keep playing.  Any game that has IAP ranging from $.99-$99.99 is an instant no for me, no matter how polished or appealing. I wanted to try this game because someone recommended it being similar to Pokemon Shuffle, which will be coming to Android soon. I certainly hope it doesn't have an energy system like Angry Birds Fight.."

There seems to already be a fairly good variety of enemies. Its easy to tell where you need to go to travel between zones thanks to the blue glow.   The bad:   Weapons are too hard to find.  I only found 2 and they were right near each other in the water temple thing with the giant snake statue. Its really difficult to tell what you can click on and what you can't.  I found similar looking chests in the inn and near a few statues, but I could click on the ones near statues but not the ones in the inn. The UI needs work, equiping a weapon was a bit confusing since I was trying to activate it appearently.  An """"equip"" button would be nice.   The buggy:   Sometimes you don't auto respawn, and if it gives you the respawn button you can keep attack in a monster when you are dead with the button on the right. When you zone it shows a different character model for a moment."

I died several times because I wanted to move and I just couldn't, for various reasons. Get some good ol analog stick here and it'll be fine. Also the camera could be better.  It needs a goal, a story... We were just walking around, finding things, fighting monsters, which is fun but it got boring after a while. Why are we doing all this shit?  We have absolutely no idea how to do several things. I mean, we figured out things like crafting and cooking and such. But give us anything. I still don't know how do I open chests.  But, even if the game has some flaws, I still like it. It's an unique survival rpg experience, it looks beautiful and I can play it with someone else. It definitely has potential.  Also, how big is this game? We're currently at the beach and we explored several locations, including the city, the tower, inn, and some caves."

AndroidGaming,3c4apx,FurbyTime,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"I bought it out of loyalty to the title, but as a port it's not good.  It's a full on lazy port of the IOS version, down to the same resolution types that result in black borders on Android devices. As a port itself it wasn't really redesigned for touch screens- More that they just added a few novelty touch screen options, then just on screen buttons for anything they couldn't figure out in a few seconds. Some of the touch screen buttons jump out at you in a jarring way that shows they just shoved something on the screen for you to touch to do what you would have done in that situation.  That being said, they did give you the ability to skip cutscenes, and the graphics for the player sprites were updated and look nice.  I said it when I first gave a mini review: If you've never played the game at all and want to do it on your mobile device, it's good enough for that. If you've played it before and want it on mobile, you'd be best suited using an emulator for your favorite version (PSX vs PSP)."

PF:GE is a quality farm game with a twist. Great gameplay, hand-drawn art. The game is finished, yet ""still growing"": updates often add new features. The devs are very close to the players with regularly updated FB posts with Q&A, tips and Twitch streams, which is not very common among studios afaik.  There are of course IAPs, but the in game currency is very easy to earn, and is not required to advance in the game in ANY WAY, which is a great thing in these times. Video ads and surveys are also a source of premium currency.  You need to have internet connection to play unfortunately, but some parts of the game wouldn't work without it anyway.

AndroidGaming,3c1zp5,Patremagne,15,Sat Jul 4 00:47:54 2015 UTC,"Move to SD doesn't move any of the data files from games. Only the app itself.  For example, XCOM has 2.8GB obb file that can't be transferable unless you're rooted and you use apps like foldermount. If you move the app to sd, all it will move is the app itself which isn't that big in the first place. The game data files are still stored in the storage.  Unfortunately, most big games have other data files that needs to be installed to play the game. Particularly games that are over 500MB will have obb files."
AndroidGaming,3c1zp5,unknown_ninja,7,Sat Jul 4 03:05:13 2015 UTC,"As someone who isn't super knowledgeable about tech stuff, but can follow instructions very well... do you know of a guide somewhere on how to root, what rooting does, and then how you can move these files around once rooted?"
AndroidGaming,3c1zp5,Thiery_de_Menonville,5,Sat Jul 4 03:43:50 2015 UTC,"Rooting method is different for every device. XDA would be a good place to search for rooting method for your device. Rooting allows you to access your phone root data files. Be wary though that rooting usually voids warranty for your phone. There are ways to un-root your device after rooting, but every phone is different and some are unrootable.  After you root it, all you need is SuperSU. Some apps need access to your root and SuperSU gives access to those files on your device to make the app work. Finally, you can get foldermount and it will be able to do its job if you did the previous things. You can move the actual game data files that takes up a lot of space to your SD card and link it to the game app itself so that the game looks for the files on your SD instead of the internal storage."
AndroidGaming,3c1zp5,unknown_ninja,2,Sat Jul 4 04:06:48 2015 UTC,Theres also the posibility with xposed. If you have exposed you can get obb to sd and every time you put an obb on the sd card it will link it automaticly

If you already use Xposed and want convenience along with it, Obb to SD is extremely easy to use so it is possible to take that root. Unlike foldermount and Link2SD, you don't need to do anything except enable the app and make a folder extSdCard/Android/Data and extSdCard/Android/Obb and start moving the files there.  Of course, if you don't like Xposed, you can always take the foldermount or Link2sd method. Either way, you would need root no matter what."

AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,diction203,39,Fri Jul 3 17:08:27 2015 UTC,Can't imagine anyone liking the Amazon app store better. I used it on my phone years ago and from time to time on my daughters Kindle Fire and it makes me appreciate just how good the Google Play Store is. Free games are nice but its not worth dealing with that mess.
AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,antonyourkeyboard,65,Fri Jul 3 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"By far the biggest drawback to the Amazon store is that Amazon apps will often not get updates for long periods even after the same app has been updated on the Play Store. I've heard of some apps basically never being updated after initial release on the Amazon store because there's little incentive for devs to do so (small user base etc.). For that reason alone I prefer the Play Store. Amazon also has a very poor download/update interface. However, it's hard to turn down free apps on Amazon which is pretty much the only reason why I use it (via FAOTD or Amazon coins)."
AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,starboard,16,Fri Jul 3 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"I've gotten around $30 in Coins from Amazon and between that and their free apps and humble bundle I'm pretty much set. I have all the most popular titles, Google opinion rewards fills in the gaps."
AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,SrslyCmmon,3,Fri Jul 3 19:05:59 2015 UTC,Do you know if there's a way to be emailed or something when an app that gives you coins is free?
AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,Patremagne,5,Fri Jul 3 19:16:46 2015 UTC,There was a free coin giveaway a little over a year ago. You downloaded a bunch of free apps and they gave you a dollar in coins for each one. There hasn't been one since that month that I'm aware of. There were a few opportunities to buy cheap games and get like $5 in coins but those are gone now too.
AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,SrslyCmmon,11,Fri Jul 3 19:31:10 2015 UTC,Play store. My biggest pet peeve with Amazon is it doesn't preserve your scroll position when you click on an app and go back to the list. This can be very frustrating.
AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,androidgamerguy,2,Fri Jul 3 18:40:36 2015 UTC,"They fixed it for a while, but now it's even worse.  For a glorious few weeks it was remembering where I was in the list if I clicked on something.  Now, if you click on an app in the list to see the description, when you hit the back button it goes back to the main screen and you have to click on the little hamburger, choose my app, and then click on ""Cloud"" just to get back to the list.  Not to mention you have to click on the app icon, if you click anywhere except the icon (such as the name of the app) it does nothing and you think the app has quit working.  If it weren't for the free apps, I'd remove it from my phone."
AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,BranWafr,8,Fri Jul 3 21:41:11 2015 UTC,"Play store is better technically of course, but I use Amazon at least as much (FAotD and it has some things not on the play store)."
AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,jedinatt,9,Fri Jul 3 17:26:13 2015 UTC,"Amazon app store runs in the background 24/7 to provide its DRM stuff.

I get my FAOTD religiously (700+?) but haven't had AAS installed in a year or more."

AndroidGaming,3c0f5k,reeegiii,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:50:08 2015 UTC,The annoying thing is that when one of your apps does need an update it incessantly badgers you about it even if you swipe the notifications away. And the actual priced of updating a single app feels like it takes about a minute and a half. And about 50 clicks.

Which is too bad, because I have a lot of apps from Amazon that she would like on her phone.  Oh well, she's getting a new phone for her birthday so that won't be a problem anymore."

Hell no) The play store's biggest draw lets me pay for games and apps with my own phone balance similar to the old days of buying j2me games through GPRS.  I do like Amazon's Free Apps though, but when I noticed that I couldn't play my games without it bolted into my small phone's already miniscule internal memory it was really not worth it."

I can pause the game (close the lid) at any point and return to it whenever I like.   On Android, if you switch away to read a text and then come back... Boom! Splash screen. Yes Kemco, I know you made the game and I know what it's called. I just checked a text, why were you unloaded from RAM just for that?  The games on the DS are are much higher quality as well (which ticks me off, I have a GS5, why are old DS games better than new Android games?) I'm currently saving for a 3DS myself as a result."
AndroidGaming,3c2f9z,tsaot,7,Sat Jul 4 11:57:39 2015 UTC,"If you are playing pretty much GTA/KOTOR level games then sweep the 3DS library and see how many 3DS games you'd play.   The 3DS lacks the sort of 'mature' games like GTA/KOTOR but it does have stuff like monster hunter and stuff, beyond those you are practically on the nintendo train with stuff like mario/smashbros/mario kart/animal crossing/etc. Personally i have nothing wrong with this but you might if those games aren't your thing.  Another factor is that the 3DS is exactly that where as android devices have far more flexibility also probably the biggest factor people are likely to spam here - emulation. Down side is short of a nvidia shield you are going to have to jury rig some sort of controller setup - personally i wouldnt want to be doing that on public transport, also IMO battery life is going to blow.  Personally i'd go 3DSXL, but if you want the more mature games, android it'll have to be."

That said, yeah rigging everything up on a bus is a pain in the ass.  And if I'm in for a 30 minute subway ride, popping open my 3DS has been drastically easier than trying to use a rigged up diy gameklip.  And I wouldn't leave a moga or ipega attached.  All the more reason to go to the new XL. Another 'pro' to that list then!"

I actually use 3D because it tracks you and you don't have to hold your 3DS and head at weird angles. It also seems to have better battery life but that might be because my other 3DSXL was old.

AndroidGaming,3byo3o,prentle,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:40:36 2015 UTC,"It takes a lot of factors into consideration, such as your age, sex, location, interests, past answers etc. These are businesses and organizations who are paying Google for this information and they have a limited amount of money to spend, so if your demographic is saturated or the personal profile Google has on you is not interesting for these companies, there's a lower chance that you will get a question."
AndroidGaming,3byo3o,androidgamerguy,-6,Fri Jul 3 06:13:46 2015 UTC,I think you may be confused... there is no way that a company pays 40 cents to give me a 40 cent expiring credit... I was under the assumption that Google themselves were using the data.
AndroidGaming,3byo3o,androidgamerguy,6,Fri Jul 3 11:45:11 2015 UTC,I think you may be confused...  I was under the assumption   Googling is more productive than assuming:  https://support.google.com/consumersurveys/answer/2530825?hl=en  https://support.google.com/consumersurveys/answer/3541440?hl=en  http://www.google.com/insights/consumersurveys/pricing  https://support.google.com/consumersurveys/answer/2372144?hl=en  https://support.google.com/consumersurveys/answer/6013193?hl=en
AndroidGaming,3byo3o,jesusice,3,Fri Jul 3 12:16:06 2015 UTC,"No one cares about if you use the credit. Companies pay Google to gather market research. I used to do this for years and it involved approaching randoms in the mall hoping that they fit into the demographic quota you were paid to get. Respondents were paid in cash. But now Google has found a way to do that cheaper and easier. They already have a database of user demographics and can reach respondents instantly and complete in hours what would've taken weeks using old methods. On top of that Google doesn't pay in cash. They pay in credit that can only be used to purchase from Google's store and Google gets to keep a certain percentage of what you spend.  I hope this clears up your confusion. The end is not to get you to spend the credit. Google gets paid regardless of what you do with the credit. If you don't spend it, even better. Now Google has paid nothing to gather your data and sell it.  As to why you don't get many surveys? Your opinions aren't desired either because you're a demographic that doesn't use or purchase the products in question or because they've just got too many of your demographic already. For example, if you're a 20-something male without children then you're probably out of luck. You guys are a dime a dozen on Android."

AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,buddha_abusa,3,Thu Jul 2 20:18:41 2015 UTC,I usually run out of fuel
AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,TehSerene,2,Thu Jul 2 23:27:04 2015 UTC,I swapped out my main ship for one that uses Oxygen and Hydrogen as fuel. I ran down to almost no fuel left and found an Oxygen rich planet and after getting into orbit I had like 2 fuel left and they usually allow you to do a last ditch effort type of thing. So I landed on the planet.   Instead of filling up my fuel it just killed me. Kind of sucks landing an O fueled ship on an O planet should fill your air and the tanks. Sucks that it does not.
AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,TehSerene,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:41:15 2015 UTC,I suppose you needed enough oxygen to make it through atmospheric entry while keeping your crew cabin pressurized. You landed but had already asphyxiated. A sad and tragic end to the fated traveller.

AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,Avamander,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:36:01 2015 UTC,"But the game still has some major flaws.  1) Pseudorandom should be used instead of random  2) Glitches  3) Small ships, geez, it is the future, why can't there be bigger ships than 20 squares?"
AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,AngryWriter,2,Thu Jul 2 13:43:27 2015 UTC,"I've achieved some of the win conditions with smaller ships. I don't think the game is supposed to be laden with Monty Hall-grade excess.   The difficulty is what I like about it. Having to make tough choices about what to take or do. And getting fucked for something you couldn't have anticipated is part of the difficulty that I, personally enjoy.   I would not consider those flaws. Bugs, those always suck.  But I have no issue with the game design."
AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,Avamander,3,Thu Jul 2 14:26:18 2015 UTC,"Why should they remove the possibility to get a bigger ship or just a different ship in that matter? They're all the same basically offering almost nothing different compared to others.  It is not difficulty, it is gambling. Random function they use makes it possible to get extremely unlucky that removes all the fun from the game because it just screws you over and over again. Pseudorandom would give the player both unlucky and lucky strikes so that user can actually enjoy the story (Spoiler: the stories ain't great)"
AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,NeroIV,0,Thu Jul 2 20:17:38 2015 UTC,"Randomness is an intentional game design. Many games work this way. I'm fond of it because it kind of reminds me of playing some of the more hardcore /r/roguelikes  that I've been addicted to for ages.   It's not like anyone is saying you have to like it. But complaining that the game design is inherently flawed isn't really solid logic. I assume you avoid card games, dice, role playing games with RNG-based mechanics, and so forth.   Having played the game quite a lot (I really like it), I can reliably make it quite far in the game or complete a given end condition. It's a lot like playing Pixel Dungeon -- if you don't learn how to overcome the challenge of unpredictable threats and resources, you won't make it far. However, this doesn't stop many players from very routinely advancing quite far.  Randomness is a legit game design approach. It's also completely legit to not like it. But you should be clear that it's personal preference not a flaw in the game. That's like bitching that FPS's suck because you need good eye/hand coordination and you don't have it. The FPS doesn't suck, it just means you aren't good at it. Something I've long accepted about myself."
AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,lbrol,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"This ain't like bitching that FPS's suck because I need good eye/hand coordination because that would be my problem bad random that ruins gameplay is the game's problem.  Remember that I made it to all endings despite the shitty random they use and I am just disappointed because the story is weak and if random decides to screw me there is nothing I could do, I'll just lose the game."
AndroidGaming,3bv7wk,TehSerene,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:09:25 2015 UTC,"Never played the game, but I agree that that doesn't sound like a list of flaws, it just sounds like a list of ""things I don't like""."

AndroidGaming,3bwd21,HillDrag0n,3,Thu Jul 2 22:08:30 2015 UTC,"In order to check licensing with google, and be able to allow you to use the game with the same account across multiple devices, we have to use the Identity permission. We do not read or store your identity in any way except a unique ID that is provided by Google and associated to your Google account, it contains no personal information and is just a UUID.   For the other permissions, it's the same, they allow us to do things we are not interested in, but we only use functionality that is directly related to making the game work, for example in order to write a cache file for games we have to use the photo/media/files permission, which we only use for that one purpose, writing and reading game cache files, nothing else.

Tapping the screen, swiping at the screen, holding notes down, standard stuff.  Using the microphone to play however is probably more interesting way to play the game. Upon selecting the option, you are given the choice to test the microphone and tune the noises that you will make louder or softer. Making noises will substitute for button presses in the game. Would recommend using quick and sharp noises for this section.  There are three major IAPs in the game. For new tracks, avatars and items. The biggest transaction in the game is a $41 IAP used to buy a set of 48 tracks in the game. Unsure if you can unlock it eventually. Other than that, all IAPs are priced within the $0.99 to $15 range. Buying individual songs is possible or buying specific packs such as the Arc System Works pack is possible.  Buying avatars in game can change the layout of the stage or help clear a stage more easily. So far all avatars in the store you unlock only makes the stage easier to clear. That high score will still be attainable with enough practice.  Buying items or using them either changes the layout of the track or makes the game easier to play. (Making the avatar invisible) I do not know if using these items will give a direct increase to score.  There are two ways to unlock music in this game. Either by playing the game regularly or purchasing them. I do not know if you can unlock all of them by playing regularly.  Some of the music tracks include:  Rebellion - Daisuke Ishiwatari (Arc System Works) Two faced lovers - wowaka Children Record - JIN (Kagerou Project) ""VISIONNERZ -Genshijin-"" - OGR (Darius Gaiden) Play merrily - Shohei Tsuchiya  Game is AD-FREE with IAPs.  Game size is kept to a minimum of approximately 8mb at the start and only downloads songs when you play them for the first time. Currently played 10 songs and used approximately 50mb. I will expect it to increase as I play further and unlock more songs.  Edit: Made/Corrected errors on the artists name.  There are a lot of details I have not covered yet. I'm typing out on a phone. I think I've mentioned the most important stuff in the game. You will have to start discover the game by yourself."

The 'track' is twisty, filled with mesmerizing visuals. On the previous, iPhone-only release, multitouch is not supported. With the release of Groove Coaster 2 on mobile, TAITO added support for multitouch play, adding more note variations to match its arcade counterpart."

AndroidGaming,3bsvh3,iWizardB,30,Wed Jul 1 21:40:52 2015 UTC,Dammit I bought this four days ago.  Although I should mention I already uninstalled it. The writing is just okay and DRIPPING with sarcasm. The story progresses at your own pace but late in the story the four hour intervals turn into push notifications ever three minutes and Taylor was too entertained by his own soaking sense of humor for me to care whether he loved or died.
AndroidGaming,3bsvh3,houseofbacon,8,Wed Jul 1 23:20:00 2015 UTC,"I absolutely felt this way at the beginning as well. But I'm just getting to the ending right now and it's hooked me in.

The fact that he comes off as a sarcastic middle school child that turns everything into a joke just had me rolling my eyes.  I uninstalled it, couldn't deal with the writing."

AndroidGaming,3bsxom,_pelya,3,Thu Jul 2 09:30:54 2015 UTC,"Greenpants here kind of nailed it.  As an artist I really need some kind of cohesive artstyle in the games I play. I don't care if it's pixel art, low poly flat shaded or high res hyper realistic, but Swordigo's artstyle feels like it has hardly any control over their meshes, used photoshop filters for their textures and have no idea what a colour palette is.  Not to rag on it, I'm sure it's a great game but this is just what makes me not able to play it. :("

LinkMe: Doctor Who Legacy."
AndroidGaming,3btg5s,tmj31,2,Thu Jul 2 08:27:10 2015 UTC,"An alternate take from a lifelong Doctor Who fan: Legacy is one of the most engaging match-3 puzzlers I've seen, and it has Doctor Who imagery and terminology all over it.   What it lacks (at least from the stuff I've played so far) is anything resembling a coherent plot. It looks like it's trying to, with snippets of dialog stringing together encounters - but the dialog might as well be randomly generated from a list of stock phrases, for all the sense it makes. The characters' personalities are virtually nonexistent in dialog, though, in fairness, there is an enormous cast of characters to choose from and gradually level up. While they have a lot of different special abilities, they start to blend together after a while.   Beyond that, it's one of those games which increases difficulty primarily through adding more enemies and giving them more HP. There are s few variations, such as timed levels, but even these use the more HP/more enemies route for increasing difficulty.  So, from my perspective, it's a fun puzzle RPG which uses the Doctor Who theme in an almost purely decorative sense."

You have a team of pets like Pokemon that determine your damage per colour of gems you match. There's guilds and you really need to work closely together as you fight bosses.    However it's very spender rewarding, if you spend on an event, you will rank high and get better monsters. So if you're on the low end of the spender curve for an event, everyone will improve faster than you so in order to actually improve you need to spend more than average.    Fun game if you have a lot of disposable income."

It's set in the zombie-pocalypse and you and a small band of survivors must find a way to reclaim your town or find some sort of rescue.  You start with a basic 'base' and need to send missions to clear blocks, find resources, rescue others, or simply thin the zed herd. The people you rescue are unique and bring different skills to the table. Researchers will make it possible to advance through a tech tree that spans base defenses and other structures, ways to better kill zombies, and possibly find a way out.   It's a lot of fun  and well done. And Rebuild 3 is coming out soon for Android (already out on Steam for PC). IIRC, if you buy Rebuild 3 from the developer's website, you will be able to join the Android beta for it.   Linkme: Rebuild"

If it comes out in four months for Android, then you can buy it and enjoy it.  Okay, who cares if it comes out on another platform first in two months?

AndroidGaming,3bqhyv,rube,21,Wed Jul 1 23:53:26 2015 UTC,"I have no patience for timed exclusives when Android is the platform with a higher user count.  On PC, I use Linux, and expect the opposite; things come to Linux after a delay, since it is the smallest in terms of users.  Buying (or just using) applications that continue to do timed exclusive deals with Apple is only justifying the behavior, and as a consumer, I do not approve of that behavior.  EDIT: To be clear, I'm not talking about a difference of a week or so, just because the Play Store drags their feet with approving; I'm talking about a delay of months just because the developers in question choose to develop for iOS first, knowing that Android is globally bigger in terms of users)."
AndroidGaming,3bqhyv,k2trf,7,Wed Jul 1 12:40:42 2015 UTC,"The problem here is that they go towards where the developers will receive more money, which is towards iOS users. I wished we got platform parity in releases but it's a business, Apple probably pays for exclusivity and the dev know they'll make more money on that platform so they stick with it."
AndroidGaming,3bqhyv,OrangeScarface,2,Wed Jul 1 13:43:47 2015 UTC,"Firstly, thank you for not being one of those people that try to argue Apple having a significantly smaller market share, but a higher revenue payout for developers than Google does.  Secondly, you're likely right, and it is a shame, but it can only be stopped by consumers voting with their wallets; this is why I do exactly that. One person won't change anything in that regard, but eventually enough people will get tired of the timed exclusives (although they may get tired of scummy IAPs first), and eventually there'll be enough people to make a difference.  Either that or developers will take the Garry route, and assume there's no need to port to Android with any sense of importance because nobody really is going to consume what is produced (meanwhile they're just refusing to consume the pile of s*** that exists)."

Also starves you for premium currency to force you to buy in if you want to keep progressing.  Chain Chronicle, good story, pretty good gameplay for a party builder.  Decently generous with premium cash and lots of events.  Has the feel of a classic RPG that got turned into a card collector, which is a good thing.  Some of the menus are clunky to navigate.  Summoner's War, I only recommend it because it fits the genre and sort of the art style.  Grind is kinda extreme, and the draw rates are terrible so even if you pay chances are you'll get nothing useful.  Soccer Spirits, story is mostly anime tropes but the artwork is good for almost all characters.  Gameplay is fantastic, better than all of the above options with the exception of possibly  Chain Chronicle (I personally feel Chain Chronicle can be a bit too fast paced later on).  Super generous with premium currency and mechanics, you can pay nothing and still compete with all but the biggest whales endgame.  UI is clean and easy to use.  Also has some really good music, though they still are adding new tracks so some things sound the same."

AndroidGaming,3bozst,URETHRAL_FECES,47,Thu Jul 2 01:34:29 2015 UTC,In my opinion the game should be banned from the app store until it's fixed where it doesn't try to bribe you.

Which is true, the app can't even verify if the user has rated it at all.  That, and I think the dev console only shows ratings that have a review attached to them."
AndroidGaming,3bozst,stratos_,1 point,Wed Jul 1 11:10:13 2015 UTC,"Of course, it can't. I pretty much misread the original picture assuming it was a troll reviewer.  This is the kind of the same as the dungeon keeper thing where you get sent to google play review only if you selected 5 stars in the app.  I assume the dev just hopes the user doesn't know he can't actually detect the rating, I do the same thing with unlocking a gamemode if they tweet about my game. If they tap the tweet button they get sent to twitter but they can just back out without posting and they get the gamemode."

(edit) Whether they say yes or no, it never returns  One user left a review ""Ask me to review your game? Well here is my review"" 1/5 stars.  So, while bribing for reviews isn't great, I think we will find low quality reviews no matter what, some people are just unreasonable and don't understand that on the other end there is actually a real live human being too."
AndroidGaming,3bozst,nickervision,25,Wed Jul 1 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"People should feel compelled to write a review, not be pestered. The worst offenders don't even give you the ""don't bother me again"" option and keep doing it."
AndroidGaming,3bozst,dingosaurus,7,Wed Jul 1 01:56:34 2015 UTC,"Yah, I agree, but offering the suggestion to leave the review/rating is still perfectly reasonable for a developer isn't it?  As well, in my games, I should have said at first, after the game has been opened five times and asks the user whether they'd like to rate the game. Whether they say yes or no, it never returns."
AndroidGaming,3bozst,nickervision,3,Wed Jul 1 02:31:02 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, yes, especially once the application in question has been opened 5 times, or used for a set length of time -- they must like it to be using it that much anyways.

AndroidGaming,3bozst,k2trf,3,Wed Jul 1 03:12:03 2015 UTC,"After some thought, I think that I agree with you. Maybe there have been enough nagging apps (I'm looking at you Feedly) that the situation feels worse than it is.  As long as you allow me to say no thanks, I'm more likely (personally) to leave a rating and full review when I'm back at my PC.  Edit: a word"

AndroidGaming,3bozst,shlogan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with you seeing everything you've said in this post it's perfectly reasonable to do that.  But as someone who has also played a fair share of games from the play store and seen stupid shit like ""rate us for more plays"" anything that comes up asking ""rate me"" sorta grinds my gears. I would definitely suggest adding a human feel to any prompt that asks me to rate your game (idk how you do it, I'm just saying in general). A prompt that bluntly asks me to rate your game is going to get nothing or a negative review depending on my mood and the quality of your game. Not trying to be an ass or anything, but until I read your post I never considered it was a human on the other end and other developers that pull shit like the pic in the post has sort of soured me."
AndroidGaming,3bozst,sossles,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:06:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced asking users for reviews is worth it for the Play Store.  Once you get a certain number of reviews (say a few thousand) does anybody really care how many people reviewed it?  Does 10,000 reviews make much difference compared to 1,000 reviews?  On the AppStore it's a different story.  AppStore users don't rate/review as often, and the AppStore hides many of those reviews anyway (eg. you only see reviews from users in your country).  As a result, you need a huge number of iOS reviews worldwide to make your app look respectable.  I think the pattern of asking for reviews is probably just something that's crossed over from iOS developers that isn't really necessary for the Play Store unless you're really struggling for reviews."
AndroidGaming,3bozst,valkyriav,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:15:16 2015 UTC,"Play Store rankings depends to some degree on reviews. That makes them much more important than in the App store, where ranking is pretty much only based on downloads.  So even if no human will read those 10000 reviews, it's still important to have them (provided they are positive).  On the other hand, I'm not sure pestering a user for reviews will really help, particularly since there is no way to detect if the user actually reviewed the app. It's really annoying when some games keep bugging you regardless of whether you tapped yes or no. So you tap yes to review the app, do so, and then it still bugs you :/"

However, if I like your game, then the option should be readily available and easy to find. I know a few apps that have pestering popups, but no review options in the menu. Having ONLY popups, in my opinion, is unacceptable. I would rather just review from the store, with no reminders at all. I took the time to download the app. Trust your uses to give the feedback you deserve."

I tried running a PS1 game (Chrono Cross) on my PSP and Nexus 5 using ePSXe and, after messing with the settings a bit, I found the Nexus 5 to be superior for PS1 games - I got a better framerate and vibration, which the PSP lacks. The rest was the same on both platforms. As for PSP games, I tried using PPSSPP to run GTA: Vice City stories, and even after messing with the settings I couldn't get it to perform as well As the PSP. My final conclustion: Nexus 5 for PS1 games and PSP for PSP games. As for the controller, I'm using a MOGA Power Pro with my Nexus 5 and I recommend it."

Be sure you're using a recent build of PPSSPP from Orphis Buildbot, the Play Store version is probably outdated whereas buildbot is updated with every new commit (pretty much multiple times per day).

If you care about anything outside of those, get a good controller for your phone.  For the Nexus 5, a Moga or iPega PG-9025/PG-9028/9017 would all be good choices. Alternatively, my favorite controller is the iPega PG-9023, which wraps your phone in a way to give it a PSP aesthetic (but with handle grips!). Lag is a non-issue when properly paired as a HID device.  Alternately, if you're ballin', you could also get a phonejoy for ~$70-80, which wraps like a PSP as well but collapses small enough to fit in your pocket. I still like the PG-9023 though because it's the only controller I've found that's large enough to hold my 7"" tablet comfortably.

It's VERY well made, the UI is slick and there are SO many tools just in the client alone for learning the game and making sure you know how to play. There's zero pay to win aspects (aside from buying heroes, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but it's the model, so whatever), and the game itself runs smoothly with gorgeous graphics.   This is one of the most impressive mobile games I've ever seen."
AndroidGaming,3bnzq1,Marzz,3,Tue Jun 30 21:41:16 2015 UTC,"Just wondering, out of all the ones you have played which do you prefer?"
AndroidGaming,3bnzq1,HighestLevelRabbit,8,Wed Jul 1 01:17:41 2015 UTC,"Mechanically I'm very fond of Dota. There's lots of things you can do in the game and the skill cap is VERY high. There are still tricks I'm learning how to do even to this day. But, it also frustrates me to no end sometimes and I've gotten more mad at that game than I have literally anything else in my life. It's scary.   Awesomenauts takes the formula and throws a new twist on it and it's a damn shame it's not anywhere near as popular as the others. It's a sidescrolling game with a saturday morning cartoon aesthetic, and if I had to choose exactly one of these games to play for the rest of my life and couldn't play any other moba, I'd choose Awesomenauts.   But if I boot one up, it's either going to be Dota or Awesomenauts. I play League and HOTS occasionally when friends want to play, but it's certainly not by choice."
AndroidGaming,3bnzq1,Marzz,2,Wed Jul 1 02:40:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight. I really should give Dota more of a go but I had a fairly hard time getting into it.

AndroidGaming,3bnzq1,rorshoc,3,Wed Jul 1 16:01:11 2015 UTC,"I feel like HotS is the only option for me simply because DotA matches take so long.  I really like the mechanical complexity of DotA as well as the vast pool of heroes to choose from, and I understand that a lot of that complexity is directly resultant of the considerable game length.  However, I just can't confidently set aside anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half, particularly considering how badly you screw your team over if you have to leave the game.  This kind of compounds with the fact that DotA takes tens upon tens of hours just to be familiar with all the basic mechanics - given that I'd only have time to play two or maybe three games in a day I feel like it'd take me years before I was able to play at what I'd consider a competitive level.  I ignored HotS for a long time because my experience with DotA led me to assume that I just don't have the time to get invested in a MOBA.  I tried it a few days ago on a whim, and once I realized that most of the matches only last 15-25 minutes I got hooked pretty quickly.  It really sucks in a way though, because playing HotS really makes me hanker for the intricacies of DotA.  All the same, though, I've been having a really good time with it."
AndroidGaming,3bnzq1,partisparti,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:12:26 2015 UTC,"Hello. As a dota player who tried HotS, I gave up on HotS after ~100-150 games, I felt the game had no future. Dota is a game which is older than 10 years and will probably still be there in 10 years. I didn't feel that way about HotS, I think Blizzard will give up on the game in some years. I understand your situation but honestly even if you can play no more than 2-3 games a day I would still suggest you to play Dota over HotS. I consider Dota to a much more fun and interesting game, HotS is way too simplistic and boring for me. Dota game's average lengh is around 35-40min, games longer than 1h are very rare. And there are 20min games in dota. I would suggest you to focus on a small pool of heroes you want to learn, as you don't have much time. Some heroes are very easy to play, lich or wraith king for instance. Besides I really believe that you can have fun on dota as a newcomer or as someone playing the game as a casual. I won't lie to you, I have sunk 5000 hours into dota and I still have a lot to learn. And this is why LoL is more popular than dota, because LoL is much easier to step in, Dota can be very intimidating at the start. But if you're willing to go through this hard time of learning the basics of the game and dealing with the leavers you'll probably encounter on a regular basis in your first 50-100 games...  the game will reward you immensely and that's a game you will keep playing for years, no matter how often, few games a week or 10 a day, it doesn't matter. You will continue to play it because it's awesome, well supported by Valve and with a wonderful community. Sorry for my english, I'm no native speaker. Cheers."
AndroidGaming,3bnzq1,BillFay,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm with you man.  To me DotA is now basically just one of those Valve games that I probably won't ever uninstall (along with Team Fortress and CS:GO), even if I don't have enough time to play I still really enjoy the presentation of things like the International so I still log in from time to time.  I'd actually extend that further and say that the observer mode is one of my favorite features of DotA and it's always one of the biggest things I miss when I play other games.  I'm not super into Twitch streams but sometimes I really enjoy just popping in to whatever game currently has 500+ viewers and watching that for a few minutes.  Some day I imagine I'll probably have enough free time to play a decent amount but right now my schedule is too fragmented/unpredictable.  Again, though, I agree with all of your points. I think DotA and LoL have basically established themselves as the two pillars in the MOBA genre, and due to the massive time investment, any games trying to seriously break into that scene deal with the same problem that new MMOs face with World of Warcraft: too many players have already essentially devoted themselves to their game of choice, and there aren't enough 'un-initiated' players to start a new community around the game that would rival the size of the existing communities."

It's variety in gameplay mechanics and fast paced nature is a nice breath of fresh air in a genre that had seemingly reached a stagnation of sorts.

My issue is that it is at total loggerheads with what I look for in a mobile game- if I'm gaming on my phone rather than on a computer it's because I only have a moment and don't know for sure when I will be interrupted, so I'm not going to put myself in a position to be a leaver and ruin other peoples' fun because real life intervened."

It's got a huge battery for its power output (3100MAh battery IIRC, 1.2GHz quad core Snapdragon 400 / Adreno 305). Screen resolution is only 960 x 512 or something. So it's far from a high end phone, but with the huge battery, it lasts an eternity.   I ride the bus to work every day and game 45 minutes each way (generally emulation, either Nintendo DS, Playstation, or GBA). I play local music literally my entire work day, spend an hour or so talking on the phone on breaks, and I've still never gone home with the battery lower than 68% unless some service hung and ate up the battery.  I've measured the usage and it was coming to between 3-4% battery usage per hour for ePSXe and 3-5% battery usage per hour for NDS. The worst battery hog was Nintendo 64 (Mupen 64+ AE), draining between 6-8% battery per hour.  Even native Android games like Kingdom Rush didn't really drain a lot. I didn't really track those, but it was never more than 10% per hour, and I presume it was lower as I'd play those off and on for hours over the weekend without charging.  I've noticed screens at lower than 720p resolution have great screen time, there's little drain.

AndroidGaming,3brs90,tomkatt,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:11:54 2015 UTC,"I won't argue. Higher end phones do have faster processors and much higher resolution screens than mine. The battery life is ridiculously good on that specific phone (the LG Volt), others will vary.   That said, even my tablet gets about 5 hours or so, probably drains 15-20% per hour when doing intensive gaming (still emulation, but I'm talking Madden 2012 for PSP, or PS1 games on ePSXe with the OpenGL renderer at screen-native resolution).  I personally wouldn't buy a phone with a short battery life, I need a phone, but opinions may differ. I can accept that kind of battery life from a tablet, but not something I might need in an emergency and just need to work."

AndroidGaming,3bptxn,PsichoBrony,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:33:10 2015 UTC,"Great game so far. Seems more about logic puzzles than programming though.  I'm currently stuck on a puzzle but without all tools needed. If I could simply multiply it'd be resolved, but instead I got stuck because it's requiring some convoluted solution instead of just doing x*y."
AndroidGaming,3bptxn,tomkatt,2,Wed Jul 1 18:59:39 2015 UTC,"Is it the ""High School Hack""?"
AndroidGaming,3bptxn,tomkatt,2,Wed Jul 1 19:30:36 2015 UTC,"yeah, the one for switching the grades. I don't get it. I actually know a good deal of programming and have been working with Python and Java for over a year now, and yet I'm stumped on this puzzle because of the limitation of the tools provided.  It should be as simple as:  var_a = 0; while var_a < input * input {     var_a++; } return var_a;   or something close to that. But without using multiplication it's overcomplicated. I'll figure it out sooner or later, I just don't appreciate the unnecessary restriction. If you have any hints you can provide, I'd appreciate it.  EDIT - heck, it could be as simple as return input * input if you wanted to keep it really short. Even if the grade was less than zero that would return a positive. /EDIT  I'm assuming they want me to use ABS, which is probably the hidden case I'm missing (since I'm forced to work with addition, I'm assuming the hidden test case has negative integers)."
AndroidGaming,3bptxn,-tink,2,Wed Jul 1 19:40:24 2015 UTC,The while point is that it makes you do that without the needed operator so you understand how it works.
AndroidGaming,3bptxn,tomkatt,2,Wed Jul 1 20:40:27 2015 UTC,"I still don't like it. I mean, understand how what works? The problem is it's not clear what they want from me, other than the output to equal the value of the input squared. I don't understand why I'm limited to addition to do this.  I can't get tips or see the hidden cases, because I'm not going to sign up for a twitter account just for this game."
AndroidGaming,3bptxn,tomkatt,2,Wed Jul 1 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"Son of a rat, I solved it. I can't believe I didn't see the solution, they gave you var_a and var_b to work with for a reason.  I still wish it didn't have the restrictions though, and it's why I noted above that it seems to be more about logic puzzles than actual programming. I had it ""solved"" in under a minute with actual programming logic, but have been puzzling over it off and on for days to solve it the way the game itself wanted.  Edit - okay, and don't know why that stumped me so hard, as the next three puzzles in high school hack were a cinch and I solved them in moments."

AndroidGaming,3boczb,Chezzymann,10,Tue Jun 30 20:53:11 2015 UTC,It's exactly what you fear. Great game ruined by endless waiting until it gets boring.

AndroidGaming,3boczb,G-Solutions,4,Tue Jun 30 23:03:04 2015 UTC,Everything gets exponentially more expensive until you either pay real money or or wait all day.
AndroidGaming,3boczb,JPOnion,4,Tue Jun 30 23:25:09 2015 UTC,"Or longer.  I got to the point where it took over a week of daily gameplay to gather / create the necessary money and resources to build the next house that moves the story along.  I can tell there's a lot more content (like, a swordsman and the caves and smugglers) but I haven't even unlocked those.    It's a great game, but the timers and not-so-gentle push to use real money kind of broke it for me."
AndroidGaming,3boczb,Gabe_b,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"If you're not bothered by wait times in Clash of Clans would this game be okay, or is it even worse than that?"
AndroidGaming,3boczb,JPOnion,10,Wed Jul 1 01:29:54 2015 UTC,"Warning: long post!  I play all 3 SuperCell games: Clash of Clans, Boom Beach and Hay Day.  In my opinion they aren't the kind of games you want to play for hours at a time anyway, so wait times make sense, even long ones at higher levels.  Yes, technically they're there to push you to speed things along with gems (and maybe real money), but it's no big deal if you just stick with the timer.  On some level they even add to the game: I know I feel a weird sense of accomplishment after gathering the necessary resources and then waiting multiple days to finally upgrade my town hall.  Seabeard is a different game.  There are a bunch of islands, each with things to do and tasks to complete.  You have a lot of customization options, like different outfits or furniture, and there are different mini-games to play.  There's a lot to do and since it's a new game there's a lot more the developers could add.  This is a game you could sit and play for hours.  But you can't, not entirely.  The core game is always available, you aren't prevented from going anywhere, but after a few minutes things just get timed out and you're stuck waiting for things to complete before you can do more.  For example, a common item citizens will ask for is a pancake.  OK, easy, right?  Well, you first need an egg, milk and flour.     You get eggs by searching under bushes for worms and feeding them to chickens, but only when they're awake.  Wait 15 minutes for them to pop out an egg.   You get milk by searching other islands for a blue leaf and feeding them to cows, but only when they're awake.  Wait 22 minutes and 30 seconds for them to produce milk. You get flour by milling three wheat, which are only found in the farm when it's open on certain days.  Note that when we talk about days and time-of-day in Seabeard we're talking real-time, not game-time.  Also, only 6 wheat grow on each day wheat is scheduled to grow.  When you have three wheat take it to the mill and wait 45 minutes.     Once you have all three ingredients you go to the restaurant and make a pancake.  Pancakes take 2 hours to make.  Then you've got people that request items you only get in mini-games (or they're required to move the story along).  Well, certain items are only found if you get a gold medal in a specific mini-game, though mini-games have multiple awards for gold medals so there's no guarantee you'll get the exact award you need.  Your first problem is finding the mini-game as mini-games seem to mostly be random between different ship routes.  You can spend pearls (the premium currency) to switch a route to a random mini-game with no guarantee of getting the one you want.  Once you find the mini-game you want you better hope you have enough mini-game tokens to play it because you have a limited number (4 at a time max) and it takes 15 minutes to get another one.  Each play takes a token, so you better hope you win gold medal and get the item you need.    There are also items that don't refresh for hours upon hours, maybe even a full 24 hours.  Fish, for example, or drift wood which you'll need a lot of.  Some items only show up at certain times of the day, like rock fish.  Other items, like crops, only show up on certain days of the week.  Let's not forget about coins.  Recipes and blueprints and customization items need to be bought, sometimes with premium currency but usually with coins.  There are daily missions that give a decent amount of coins (100 to start with, 250 if you've done it 19 days in a row), but other than that it's slow to save up.  Sometimes 1 coin is hiding under a bush.  Sometimes a fish will sell for 15 coins.  If you win silver medal in mini-games you can win up to 12 coins.  The pancake recipe mentioned above is 400 coins to learn (plus 80 coins each time you cook one), others are more expensive.  Blueprints are much more, in the thousands, and you'll need those to move the story along.  Story missions don't expire, but citizen missions do, usually after 24 hours so hurry up!  Anyway, that's a brief overview of what the timers are like and how they fit into the gameplay.  As you can see they really interrupt the flow of the game, sometimes for minutes, other times for hours or even days.  Timers feel like part of the gameplay in SuperCell games, they're expected and don't overtly push you to spend real money to speed them along.  Timers in Seabeard, though, routinely bring gameplay to a screeching halt and feel like something unnecessarily increased to shove people towards the ""Buy Now!"" page.  They're needed on some level of course (real chickens don't lay eggs the instant you feed them, crops take time to grow, pancakes take time to cook, etc) but there's so many and they feel much, much longer than they need to be.  All that said, I really do think the game is nice.  The core gameplay is fun, it's a cute story and the artwork is fantastic.    tl;dr: I actually like SuperCell games and their wait times.  SeaBeard is a fun game but the wait times is the only reason I stopped playing.  EDIT: I just remembered something.  The moment I realized how greedy this game is was after I finally played 20 consecutive days and could select one of the three Master Masks as a daily reward.  Wearing one of these masks slightly increases the spawn rate of various objects (plants, monsters or fish).  You can buy them, though, if you don't want to wait.  For $80 freakin' dollars each"

AndroidGaming,3bnsvk,iDingo91,11,Tue Jun 30 18:30:34 2015 UTC,"I bought it on launch and found the negative reviews on reddit to be hogwash. The biggest complaints people had were   1: It was unchanged from the iOS version. This was silly to me, because the iOS version was fine. What needed to be changed?  2: The game didnt have a 16:9 aspect ratio, which once again I found silly because if you've played the original, the fights take place on what is effectively a floating square, nothing of value is lost by ""letterboxing"" the sides of the screen.  The game performs very well on my S6. The only real complaint I have is that $14 is a pretty hefty price tag for a 18 year old game.  If you've never played it before, I strongly recommend it; it's in my top 10 games of all time and the android port is pretty solid."
AndroidGaming,3bnsvk,omgpokemans,3,Tue Jun 30 19:03:32 2015 UTC,I came here to say the same - my biggest complaint is I'd have rather paid $10 over $15 but c'est la vie.

The sprites have been re-done and look great, there are zero slowdown issues that plagued the original PS1 and PSP versions, and the camera controls have been re-worked as well. I'm playing on a Shield tablet, so the aspect ratio doesn't bother me at all. There are two very slim black bars on the edge of the screen. My screen is 8"", but I guess someone with a regular phone screen size might feel ripped off.   TL;DR: My favorite version of tactics, to date."

I've played countless hundreds of hours in ps1,2 psp. Touch makes gameplay many times slower. You have to wait for through every menu animation for the next menu options to appear and become tappable. Even stuff you think would be easier/faster with touch, like selecting units during a turn, seeing how far units can move, what they have queued, etc... is way slower and more cumbersome.  Being so used to a fast pace, it's a deal breaker. It feels like player vs ui, rather than tactics rpg."

Deck building is currently broken on their Android port, but the Windows client syncs the decks with their central servers so I can edit a deck by booting up my XP VM. Bit of a pain, but I'm still new to these games so deck building won't be a priority right now anyway. According to their support forums they're having their clients, which were only beta, rewritten from scratch for a Fall release.  I also have decks for Star Realms thanks to that bundle. I even have physical decks  for that one. Star Realms is another cross-platform system that syncs decks across platforms and it offers OFFLINE play as well!

About the checkpoints, in my opinion that is exactly the spirit of the game. You make a little mistake, oops, you're dead in a few clicks. You have bad luck three times in a row, oops, you have to plan really exactly what you're doing now, or either you're dead. With this spirit, checkpoints would destroy these situations."

I found it was like this in the old version and hoped it would be fixed in the update. Is this supposed to be this way? It's super annoying. I even emailed the devs about this a while back and never heard from them. Reading any text is like the game is narrated by a shouty old man with a lisp.  Also Play Games integration and the back button to exit doesn't work. On a Galaxy S3.

AndroidGaming,3bikos,LimeGreenTeknii,3,Mon Jun 29 22:10:18 2015 UTC,"Geometry Wars 3 isn't a Nintendo IP. Gunman Clive, Retrocity Rampage, and Steamworld Dig are also multiplatform 3rd party titles.  What makes this unique is having a piece of Nintendo IP on any platform that isn't owned by Nintendo, and what makes this disappointing is that the game they do port to android is a lousy match-3 title that will clearly be bogged down with microtransactions."

The character is too big and jumping mechanics are too slow. I would implement a more obvious scoring system that somehow makes the game progressively harder (something that the player can recognize like score milemarkers and a speed multiplier displayed). Also all of the platforms are just blue buildings. Make some new textures and maybe give different buildings different features. Possibly slippery or sticky surfaces, and enemies to dodge.  Also, I know you are going the story-less action rout, but maybe a little excerpt in the menu that has a short explanation of why he's running and where?"
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,decafdreamer,29,Mon Jun 29 13:49:36 2015 UTC,"It's really too bad. Crescent Moon was one of the good publishers left on Android.  Hopefully their FTP model going forward will be pay to remove ads, and not energy and other timer bullshit.  Mines of Mars is (was) awesome."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,KPipes,11,Mon Jun 29 14:05:35 2015 UTC,"I can't say this is all that disappointing. Their games aren't that great when you take a hard look at them.  For all the clout it seems to have, Ravensword is at best the bastard son of a bad Elder Scrolls clone, with its predecessor and Aralon trailing close behind.  Mines of Mars will forever be dwarfed by the colossus that is Terraria.  Exiles was like a science fiction themed Ravensword, but with more bugs, less content, and some really poor controls.  Topia never did turn into anything of any substance, and why splay Strike Wing when there are entries like Galaxy on Fire and Galactic phantasy floating around? And Neon Shadow, when I can play something like DoomGLES (or D3 for fellow shield folk, DTouch if you want BrutalDoom)? There are way better options (better made, at the very least), and some of them didn't cost as much as their own at best mediocre games. And that's to say nothing of emulation (besides doom, of course).  Premium is dead for them because they aren't worth it."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,Thomas-C,3,Mon Jun 29 19:30:46 2015 UTC,"Premium is dead for them because they aren't worth it.   That is actually a very eloquent point. There was a time where sub-par upfront priced games could do fine on the store, as there was not much competition in that particular area. Now that the store has tons of good ports that are real hardcore games, it makes sense that selling a sub-par product does not fair well anymore when asking for an upfront price."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,7,Tue Jun 30 15:12:48 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone has a problem with them releasing F2P versions of their games, but screwing your paid users out of future updates to do it is a really dumb move."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,SGDCraig,22,Mon Jun 29 18:16:29 2015 UTC,I see no reason for not having a free and a paid version. If they coded their stuff properly it should be switching a bool from true to false and rebuilding.  This is what I did with Hexjack.
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,fusedotcore,6,Mon Jun 29 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"Sadly the problem here is entitlement. Instead of creating a new game or even just offering a free version of the same title, the dev/publisher feels entitled to make more money on an old mediocre game off the backs of those that were willing to support it."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,6,Mon Jun 29 14:29:53 2015 UTC,The developer is entitled? It's 100% their decision how they market their game. Your post makes it sound like you are shaming the developer when its really the customers who irrationally feel entitled to whatever gaming model they prefer. If customers didn't 'choose' the FTP model they wouldn't have switched to it.
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,fudsak,4,Mon Jun 29 15:54:44 2015 UTC,"The problem being the choice was made for a premium game, of which it no longer is. It was the studio that chose to offer a premium app, of which they willingly sold with the understanding that it is an upfront paid game with zero in app purchases or advertisements. Now they want to change their decision as they want to earn even more on a titles that are years old and people already paid for and in return screw those that supported them. So yeah, it's the dev that is the problem here, not the customers who gave them money for a premium product that they now do not have."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,-6,Mon Jun 29 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"Uh, no? The article linked says that it will still be ad-free for those who purchased the premium version and they will continue to support that for everyone who purchased it. The decision to go FTP only affects anyone downloading the games moving forward."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,fudsak,8,Mon Jun 29 16:30:05 2015 UTC,"Nope, read it again.   ""If you plan to install on a new device, just let us know your order ID and we'll get you a copy of the previous paid build version,"" Crescent Moon said in an email.   All it takes is the app needing to be reinstalled to no longer have the premium ad free version. It is tied to the game saves as users have already reported.    As previously mentioned, the latest update will negate the paid download if you just so happen to have Uninstalled the game previous to the update and tried to reinstall as I did. I don't have time to watch ads for a mediocre game.   Considering Android tends to not be the most stable of OS's with users needing to do full wipes after OS updates due to bugs and errors, there is a high chance many users will need to reinstall their apps at some point before a device is replaced. There is also the fact that users often have to swap out apps due to low storage. Not to mention the fact that most devices are not owned longer than a year or two to be replaced with a new one, which means new installs of every app.  People paid for a full ad free version of the game, they no longer own a full ad free version of the game the second they have to reinstall the app. This is called a bait and switch, another word for it is fraud."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:37:32 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you can always get back to the paid, ad-free version via the developer. What's not clear to me is if they will continue to update that path or if you have to switch to an ad-supported version to get updates. If so, that does suck."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,fudsak,4,Mon Jun 29 16:54:22 2015 UTC,"From the quote it sounds like they are offering the version before ads went live, which means the premium version will not be receiving any updates. Plus, who wants to email and sideload an app they paid for anyways?"
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,-1,Mon Jun 29 17:02:40 2015 UTC,"thats just how everything works. it comes out- you pay the early adopter premium, over time the price drops as the demand drops."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,Shadow_Being,4,Mon Jun 29 18:02:53 2015 UTC,"I understand that, it sucks to pay full money for something and a day later it's in sale. And now it's free instead of paid, and on new devices they need to deal with ads?  Jerk move, but if it had been a separate app most of the user wouldn't even have known. But now they do as it's an update."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,fusedotcore,4,Mon Jun 29 14:33:28 2015 UTC,"It is new devices and new installs (it's tied to the games saves). It should not be on those that paid for the app to be used just because the studio does not want to advertise a new version that is free. If the game is not popular enough to warrant a separate free version on its own merit, maybe that's a clue. Taking away premium in order to stay relevant is not a worthwhile excuse.  What this boils down to is that Crescent Moon does not care they are screwing over their paying customers, as from this point forward their target are those that download FTP. Just another in a long line of studios to avoid on Android I suppose.  For those looking for refunds, go here, click on Actions (the three dots), report a problem, Purchase is defective or does not work as advertised. Google will refund you no matter how old the purchase is."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,5,Mon Jun 29 14:38:14 2015 UTC,"The problem really lies in shovel-ware. I don't mind paying for a quality game, but you can't find the damn things. The search functionality of the store is useless. Reviews are useless as unscrupulous designers try and bait out good reviews right after a tutorial resulting in shitty games getting good scores. So in the end you wind up with most of the shit on the store not being worth a dime and people highly unwilling to spend cash.  No, I don't know the solution."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,jdmgto,10,Mon Jun 29 19:40:21 2015 UTC,"Gotta love the concept of screwing over those that bothered paying for your product, instead of releasing a new version that is FTP. Not only is this a shit move, it is just lazy. When Beavl Games did this a week or two ago for Kapsula, sure it's a poor move, but they are a tiny studio who might not have the manpower to have multiple releases of titles, what exactly is Crescent Moons excuse here?"
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,-1,Mon Jun 29 14:00:48 2015 UTC,"If you read the article it said previous users won't see ads, only new downloads.  I still hate the whole thing but your facts are off a bit."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,KPipes,10,Mon Jun 29 14:04:22 2015 UTC,"They will see ads on any new device or download of the app. So if it ever gets uninstalled, you have to do a wipe of your device, you get a new device, that's it, there will be ads. Instead of making a new FTP app and leaving this one without ads they are literally offering old versions of the app to then sideload in order to skirt the ads for those that do not want them on their new devices.   ""If you plan to install on a new device, just let us know your order ID and we'll get you a copy of the previous paid build version,"" Crescent Moon said in an email.   So no, I don't think my facts are off a bit."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,6,Mon Jun 29 14:07:34 2015 UTC,Well that sucks. I read it and thought they would license check the date or something and based on purchase date wouldn't show ads. If not then fuck them.  I got mines of mars via humble bundle so I don't have to worry.

AndroidGaming,3bid2s,ceanji,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:07:19 2015 UTC,I realize that yeah. Publishers/Developers offer up their games pretty much as is on the date of the bundle from what I've seen. I actually can't recall a single update being available after about 6-8 bundles bought over the years.  The odd time my HB games tie back into google play (I think it's a bug) and I can continue to update them. Strangest thing but I won't complain.

AndroidGaming,3bid2s,diction203,2,Mon Jun 29 17:29:49 2015 UTC,"If they want to go FTP, that is on them, but you do not do it by taking away peoples already paid in full apps.  This is not a move that one of the biggest publishers on Android needed to do in order to stay afloat, it is simply a money grab on old content.   Making an upfront paid game does not guarantee you will earn money, that was their choice. To cheat the people that did pay for it though is a slimy move and is completely unnecessary of a studio of this size."
AndroidGaming,3bid2s,thermoplastics,-2,Mon Jun 29 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"Maybe the ""money grab"" is necessary to keep those games alive, but I see your point (it's a little minor since the game does remove the apps if you paid). Anyway they might come with some more options given the reactions."

AndroidGaming,3bifrc,Interanc,27,Mon Jun 29 14:14:10 2015 UTC,"I mean, of course. Shoving ads in our faces makes more profit than releasing a game for $5. Not sure if I like it or not. I definitely understand why devs are doing it though.  Eh, as long as the game doesn't have an energy system I'm fine with ads and iaps in free games. I'd still rather get a complete game without any of that bs of course."
AndroidGaming,3bifrc,Imasgrohn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:30:25 2015 UTC,Not an expert but I think a game sold for $5 is generating more money than an ad-infested game. It might have lower downloads but to get $5 with ads you need a lot of installs.
AndroidGaming,3bifrc,TwistedTomZ,4,Mon Jun 29 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"Well, lets say that we have a game where you die a lot. Every 10 deaths the game shows you a pop up ad. Also there's a banner at the bottom of the screen. Plus, you can get special outfits and such for some extra cash. There's more, dev can implement energy system that you can recharge for $$$. All of this generates money. The amount of it depends how greedy the dev is and how many active users app gets daily/weekly etc.  Considering the fact that people are more likely to download a free app rather than to buy a paid one, it's gonna get more downloads than the game numero 2.  Now we have the aforementioned second, paid game. Let's say that they sell it for $5, without any ads or iaps. 1000 people bought it, which is usually the case when it comes to indie/lesser known games. Devs get $5000. That's it. The other dev can get even $50 - $100 every week, and that's only ad revenue. Add iaps and energy system and you're rich. Of course most devs aren't that greedy but it doesn't matter, I know a lot of people that play ad/iap ridden games everyday and I've seen a lot of paid games with less than 100 downloads.  I'm not an expert as well and probably everything I just wrote is bullshit. Can we get an actual dev here?"
AndroidGaming,3bifrc,Imasgrohn,3,Mon Jun 29 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"I'm an actual indie dev, but we're really new and only have one game out so far.  From what I understand, ad revenue generates around $6/1000 views. That means if 1 million people played our game once, we'd have $6000 total. This is absolutely ridiculous when you think of the development cost to make one. It is easy to burn $30k to $50k on development hours.  I think most people over-estimate how much money these smaller games make. It is very winner-takes-all. Most people only play games that are very high quality (very expensive to make) and they only pay for the best of the best.  So we are definitely leaning towards IAP for our next game. Seems like it has more potential. If we charged a price for our game up front, no one would buy. Period. But of course, making a game that is more fun to play gives us more of a chance. It's a learning process. A very expensive learning process."

I even try to avoid game with ads, but sometimes there's nothing to do.   I think people should not support such a greedy behavior, I mean maybe a banner and some IAPs is good, but using 2-3 ads and many IAPs and energy bar is just too much."
AndroidGaming,3bifrc,TwistedTomZ,3,Mon Jun 29 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"I talked about this before in this sub - the mentality of majority is ""buying console/pc games - sure, but I ain't paying for a mobile game"". Typical Android user will pull out his phone during a coffee break and play something stupid for a moment. Then he'll come back home and play on a console, because it's a better alternative.  They shouldn't support them, but right now ""iaps are not that bad"" is a selling point.   I'm avoiding games with all kinds of energy systems because they are just incredibly stupid and they ruin the whole experience for me. I'm not buying iaps when I don't have to. I liked what AdVenture Capitalist devs did, giving you bonuses for watching ads, that was good for both sides. But it's not as profitable as shoving ads and iaps up my face."

AndroidGaming,3bifrc,Mitchiro,6,Tue Jun 30 08:48:19 2015 UTC,"Because of the fact that people are unwilling to pay money for a quality game, devs have little choice but to go F2P with IAP if they actually want money. Otherwise, people are gonna see a price and go ""5 dollars for a GAME?? I'm not spending money on that, I'll opt for a free one with ads that will try their hardest to force me to buy something!""  I can't speak for everyone and their wallet, but think about it this way; depending on how old you are, you likely had or still have some handheld gaming device. There were never games that were released and ""cheap"" for these things; cheap would be maybe $20. If you wait for a while, the price would get lower or you could pick up a used copy (which the devs get no money for). Now we have a brand new emerging market of ""handheld"" (mobile) games at ALL kinds of price points. Yes there's a lot of garbage out there but there's also a lot of gems, and most of them are gonna cost money because the devs put in a lot of their time and money into making it. You can likely buy a dozen games on mobile for the price of a handheld game on another system. What makes mobile gaming lesser? What makes you totally unwilling to spend less than a lunch to play a game that you might think looks good?"

You could pay to make that time enjoyable and even if it's short, it all adds up. Who knows, you may even enjoy it to the point where you're sitting at home ready to play a console/PC game and say ""You know what I really want to play? Geometry Wars 3.""  Hell, I've played through Dragon Quest 1-4 and I'm currently on 5 this way. Walking to another building at work? Waiting on a bus? Boring car ride? I can play for a few minutes. These are 20-30 hour games that I paid for, had a GREAT time with, and finished by mostly playing for a few minutes at a time.

AndroidGaming,3bj6xn,litewo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:52:11 2015 UTC,"With Xposed it is, not so much using the poor apps available in the Play Store. Per app immersive mode is the want here (which none of the Play Store apps successfully do), as forced immersive mode breaks things in other parts of the OS's UI, such as using the keyboard (which is not really a problem in games). There is also the issue of backing out of games that have forced immersive mode (when using the junk apps on the Play Store) that will not allow the user to get back into the game, it just blank screens. Frankly the only acceptable tool for forced immersive mode is App Settings, which of course is not an option on the N9 due to the fact there is no official support of Xposed for that device.  Also of note is that forced immersive mode does not always work. Try forcing immersive mode in Out There, SuperBrothers, Block Legend, Puddle, Another World. This is a feature that is best set by the dev, which seems to not be happening, which is a problem for those that use Nexus devices or any other device that utilizes the nav bar. Studios as large as 2K have no excuse to not be using immersive mode in every game they sell two years after the implementation of the feature in the OS."

Again, it comes down to the lack of support of Android from devs. The state of gaming on Android just infuriates me at times. The split store for Android TV with so many missing games, the lack of any forced design guidelines (4:3, immersive mode, letterboxing), poorly optimized ports that lag, the ridiculous state of featured games on the store and it's worthless search and categorization, not to mention the constant victim blaming of gamers when they voice displeasure of these problems as well as unhappiness with FTP, PTW and other anti-consumer tactics.."

Pixel Wars Z, Game Of Survival (1, 2, 3), Zed, Zomcraft, the one op just posted... The list goes on and on. And all of these games have the exact same graphics (and most of the time GUI).

An asset called UnitZ in particular is infamously used. The pack offers a basic, functioning survival zombie game with Minecraft-y graphics, thereby hitting several trends that make scam artists see dollar signs. Unity assets are supposed to be foundations on which artists begin building their own games but has begun to be exploited by people reselling the packs."

AndroidGaming,3bijjc,FallenWyvern,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:13:18 2015 UTC,"No, time is accelerated. Think of it like playing an RTS game, such as Command & Conquer. In real life it'd take you a few months to completely organize an army. Command & Conquer lets you do that in the span of a few minutes.  Edit for clarification: I just realized that might be more confusing, so if it is just ignore it. It won't take you 80 real life days to finish the game, I beat it in under an hour for my first play through. Try watching a gameplay trailer or review, that should help give you a better idea of how the game works/looks."
AndroidGaming,3bijjc,FallenWyvern,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:06:55 2015 UTC,"No, lol, time is compressed. But there is little time to make your decisions. Since the point of the game is to get around the world in 80 days, it'll ask questions like ""where are we going next?"" and you'll have a few options but while you're looking through your options and weighing locations vs how much stuff you're carrying (it costs more to bring more stuff with you) or as you pack your bags (diablo style inventory, where you tetris stuff into your packs) time is still progressing.  My first playthrough I didn't realize that time didn't stop during dialogue or packing your bags so I only made it 1/10th the way before 80 days were up"

AndroidGaming,3bikxt,OnePunkArmy,2,Mon Jun 29 19:37:03 2015 UTC,"Well, I haven't gotten to play anymore, but from what I learned of the tutorial, there's two different types of summons. One is with what's called ""Essences."" There's six types (Water, Fire, Wind, Trees, Dark, Light... you know, the standard), and collecting 30 of these essences gets you to summon one of these types. You also get one free ""essence"" summon every.. 12 hours? You get to pick the type you want. Essence summons are 1-4 stars. Haven't seen where you get essences in game yet, but I assume its from the treasure chests you can find on each level.  You also have jewel summons. This is your typical ""cash item"" currency, where you're rewarded jewels from missons, but can also buy some. You do not pick the type for these summons, but it's 3-6 stars. You get one free jewel summon every 48 hours.  So it seems to give a lot of free items, not to mention you can enhance units to be higher stars, so I feel like it's not TOO pay-to-win.

AndroidGaming,3bikxt,OnePunkArmy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:10:12 2015 UTC,"Well that answer is complicated.   Soul hunters is a title released by the people who made the original (which is only available in Korea) for the US market.   Heroes Charge was the first successful game of that formula in the US, but ripped the code straight from the Korean version of Soul hunters.   So I'd say Soul Hunters, even though technically it just released a week or so ago."

It does have a watch-them-fight side, however the first time you do any level, there's a cool randomly generated map you have to hop around on. It's a block-based map, so you tap on different blocks to move around the map. I actually like the exploration and can't think of another game that's similar.   The combat is a different system from the exploration system. They mesh quite nicely."

Somewhat unrelated side note, Minecraft PE originally came out for the Xplay ( a big reason why I was interested in it) and it was able to use the controller on that phone.

Their reviews are well done and they have sections for games on sale, best games and other Android specific categories.  Humble Bundle has regular time-limited game bundles that let you snag some great games for cheap, while sending a percentage of the profits to charities. They also have their own app store. A lot of the games I play the most came from the Humble Bundle.  The Amazon appstore has a free app of the day and lets you buy games with amazon coins. They often have their own game sales and giveaways. For example, the sarcastic Bard's Tale is free as I'm writing this.  You need to enable the install of third party applications on your device to install games form the amazon appstore or the Humble Bundle.  IGN's Android coverage is spotty at best, but the have decent reviews of games that are avaialbe for Android and IOS."

AndroidGaming,3bi9f0,dmista21,2,Mon Jun 29 22:03:04 2015 UTC,"So to expand on this, the game has 1 premium currency called magic stones and you get around ~10 every 2 weeks or so (+ what you get from the game itself). This tends to be enough for most players and is thus fairly generous. The only issue is that IAPing really isn't since you'd require 5 Stones or around $5  per roll in the rare egg machine (It could be worth doing for stamin refills though.

You're constantly yelling at one another (just giving directions really loudly..). You always need a person who can let everyone know what to expect in the upcoming level (there's always a specific problem you'll run into on each level), like the buttons get unhinged or goop starts covering buttons and etc. I think its always best to have 1 or 2 somewhat experienced players playing with newer players then everyone starting at first.

And as a short update since it does support controllers right off the bat, I'm using a OTG cable with the PS3 controller.   I bought this yesterday with my Google Play Rewards credit. I'm going to do a brief summary of my experience.   Controllers are nice and responsive. I really like the quick weapon switch with just one press.   IAP on this aren't bad at all. There's 3 packs of currency and all of them are at a reasonable price (.99, 1.68, 3.37) These are made for the player who want to move forward more quickly.   There's 24 weapons in total, you can select 2 weapons to carry (Primary and secondary.) There seems to be a decent variety.  4 armors are available. Each has more perks than the previous set. I've only had the chance to play with the one you begin with so I can't say anything on their differences.   10 missions in total. I've only played 1 and it was short, decent level design. I don't know if there are more as bonus levels but I hope the devs add more later on.   The Google Play support is great. Cloudsaves, leaderboards and achievement support.   The graphics setting is something I wish more developers would support. Options for 60fps, detail options, and resolution settings.   I had many crashes with my LG G3, I emailed the devs my problem, I don't know how responsive they are. If you purchase it and you have these problems just go for the refund and message the devs then wait. It worked great with my Galaxy Tab 3 though so I didn't refund my purchase."

It has a stall in front of your farm where you can sell items to other players. There's also a news paper which you can check to see other players selling items in their stalls. There have been several times where I have been able to snatch up some items sold by newbs that are extremely cheep and they I resell them for the average price making some good money.  So there's some good buy low sell high stuff going on in the game.  Linkme: Hay Day.

AndroidGaming,3b9k8c,DoctorSteve,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:42:19 2015 UTC,I played the shit out of it on my laptop so did they add anything to make a mobile purchase worthwhile?
AndroidGaming,3b9k8c,omgitsbigbear,12,Sat Jun 27 11:09:52 2015 UTC,"They upgraded the difficulty by not adapting shit to mobile interfaces, and also making UI elements as tiny as possible, and added exclusivity by making the game compatible with about two devices and a half."

One thing I'd like to add is that it does have moderate replay value, but also takes an average player about 15 hours to clear the first time through, so I'd say it's a lot of game for the price.  And thanks for posting!  Nice to finally get a google alert telling me someone posted something about the game other than an .apk torrent ;)"
AndroidGaming,3bak2z,seandanger,3,Sat Jun 27 19:36:31 2015 UTC,I LOVED this game a lot but that part where you have to make the one specific rotating type of beer was really god awful and I think that's where I quit playing the first time.

AndroidGaming,3bak2z,Hurikane211,3,Sun Jun 28 02:04:44 2015 UTC,"Well it's my company comprised of just myself and my artist partner Kelly working on the game, just like in Fiz.  So I am allowed to say, I just can't say with certainty. :)  Privately I'm hoping for December, but it is going to be a real challenge to get it ready by then.  For instance, I thought Fiz would take 6 months to develop, but it wound up taking 18, so I'm pretty bad at estimating.  Anyway, I would like to release it by December, and we're working hard on it now.  It's going to be another tycoon style game, this time with a more fantasy theme.  We're sticking with what I hope will be our trademarks for management games, which is light humor and a story line included in addition to the tycoon gameplay.  I think people who enjoyed Fiz will definitely like this next one.  If you want to be notified when we've announced official details, we have a mailing list you can sign up for here.  I've never used the list yet, I only plan on using it when we are looking for beta volunteers, and when the game is released.  Thanks very much for your interest!"

I've just started a new game+ I believe I've re-checked all the same boxes under options but now when I move a batch into storage once brewed I get a confirmation box asking if I'm sure I want to move it which I don't remember happening on my first run, what haven't I checked?

AndroidGaming,3b7jav,Endda,9,Fri Jun 26 16:32:03 2015 UTC,Visually your site blows the rest out of the water. At the end of the day though content is king. I worry if you're managing it manually that it will be too cumbersome? To compete with other app-sales sites you have to be quick to both report sales and take down expirations. A few bad days where you fall behind and people will stop visiting it out of lack of trust.  That's just my two cents. I really like what you're trying to do I'm just not confident it will be a success unless it's either automated or community driven.  Good luck to you. I'll certainly keep an eye on it. Are you considering developing a companion app for it?
AndroidGaming,3b7jav,KPipes,3,Fri Jun 26 18:30:15 2015 UTC,"You definitely make very good points and I appreciate the honesty and feedback.  There's no way that I can compete with the speed of expirations or posts when compared to a fully automated site but I do hope to excel where others fail.  I have added a 'report expired sale' button, but it will be dependent on the community reporting them when they find one of them has been expired. I might be able to dedicate some time on a saturday or sunday to going through the current sales but I can't guarantee it.  I do have some plans to allow the community to submit sales to me so that I can go in and manually add them. I also hope to connect with the developer community and have them contact me when their application goes on sale.  At this time my plans for a companion application are far in the future. That is, unless the site takes off instantly so I can pull in some funding to pay for it. My history with websites are that they typically start slow and snowball in popularity  Plans can always change though but since the mobile version is good, users can simply add a shortcut to their home screen from Chrome to get that 'app feel'. Definitely not ideal but it will work for now.  If you come across any bugs or think of anything that needs to change, or maybe think of some ideas for features then I would love to hear about them. I have a few ideas brewing and I'll see if/how they can be implemented after I finish polishing up the rough edges  Thanks again for the feedback! I truly appreciate it"
AndroidGaming,3b7jav,KPipes,3,Fri Jun 26 19:00:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah all makes sense.  From what I've browsed so far...  Pros:   Vibrant, clean design Love  the section near the bottom with the colorful background where the Kemko games are highlighted. I ended up getting side-tracked looking at those games on google play. That's says something about the design lol nice ""material"" / ""card view"" design   Room for improvement:   When drilling into the list of games or apps, we should have the option to list more than the default per page. There is too much paging. Ideally the ability to 'view all' or increase the page size. I didn't immediately see a way to view thumbnails when looking at game details. It's a must. Maybe I missed it though? I like the design near the bottom of the page best and wonder about adding more 'pzazz' to the top somehow where the featured titles are. Like ""feature"" them more prominently somehow..   All I got for now..  Edit: formatting."
AndroidGaming,3b7jav,InternetExplorer8,2,Fri Jun 26 19:30:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for all the feedback. By default there is only one screenshot/thumbnail of an application but I can definitely look into putting more on there.   By the 'design at the bottom of the page', are you talking about the 'random sales' section? Like, how that grid is laid out or do you mean the background image?  I think that I could do something that will allow you to customize how many apps are viewed per category page. Or at the very least, I should easily be able to expand this from 10, to say 20 or so  Thank you again for the added feedback"

AndroidGaming,3b7jav,Grooviemann1,1 point,Sat Jun 27 13:21:43 2015 UTC,Relying on the community to report bad sales is a terrible idea. The whole reason your site exists is to tell users when sales are going on. Yet you're making them manually do it anyway. You're providing a service that's performed by the very people who want you to give them that service.
AndroidGaming,3b7jav,avipars,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:08:11 2015 UTC,"I agree, it's not ideal but it is how it is. Maybe in the future I can set something up to automatically check them but asking the community to take 2 seconds and click a button if they notice a sale is expired isn't the worst thing in the world  Hopefully the service I provide is worth it to the community to want to help out. I can go through them once per week(on the weekend) but I can't check the sales for dozens of apps every single day"
AndroidGaming,3b7jav,plaidman,4,Sat Jun 27 23:11:39 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm probably in the minority and this might be an issue because I'm on mobile but I'm really disheartened at the way modern sites value gigantic pictures over a more efficiently browse-able site.

AndroidGaming,3b7jav,xkcd_transcriber,2,Fri Jun 26 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"You're definitely not in the minority. I've had some feedback about how the site looks on mobile.

But when I look at it on my Nexus 5, it's only one column and doesn't look good at all.

AndroidGaming,3b6syz,xandan,3,Fri Jun 26 17:16:37 2015 UTC,In the third one you want to use the sound button to guide springtrap around the building without him getting into your room.  You can close one vent at a time to prevent his travel through them.  They're are also 3 systems that need to run for you to play that you will need to reset from the left panel.  If the ventilation is our for too long is game over.  If the camera system is down then you can't  see through the cameras in the right panel.  If the sounds system is offline then you can't use the sounds to guide springtrap away from you.   Occasionally you will see hallucinations.  These are there to scare you and distract you from monitoring springtrap.   If you still have any questions about it or the first one I would be glad to help.   The first one does have a guy that somewhat outlines the gameplay goals in the start.

I went into the 3rd game never having tried the series before and was surprised by how little information was given to new players. It seemed like they assumed everyone had played the previous versions. I might try the first version and see if I figure it out. It might give me enough of a feel for the game to encourage me to try the 3rd one again.
AndroidGaming,3b6syz,xandan,2,Fri Jun 26 18:06:42 2015 UTC,The third one doneness gave the least amount of info to the players. The first one actually mentions things to do as the phone guy knows what's up.

Even creatures in the same class type have different stats and abilities. It's turn based in a way that the more speed a creature has, the more it could go first or more often. It's kind of strategy where creatures also have elements that rock paper scissors each other, and it better to use some creatures vs others. There's both a campaign mode to progress through and other players to play against. Graphics are pretty good too. Encounters through campaign are kinda random. You know what creatures and what elements will appear, but the lineup in each level changes.

If you're not as big of a fan of the style, you're going to hate what I was thinking of doing then. One of the things on my ideas list is to remake the core of Bing Bong, Pivot, and Righty Tighty in this new style / engine / programming of Ding Dong. My intention was to make them smoother and better, with the power ups added too. Would make them a little more exciting. Of course I'd do them as a separate sku, so as to not remove the original versions that so many people enjoy. I just feel like i've learned so much in the last few months, that this runs so much better than those ones do, and the programming on even a couple month old game of mine now looks cluttered and inefficient. I may or may not be a bit of a perfectionist."
AndroidGaming,3b59ss,kankeinaikara,1 point,Fri Jun 26 07:01:43 2015 UTC,"The new design isn't bad in any way, but really different compared to the older ones. The idea is cool, but is it really smoother? Because I have the feeling the obstacles are legging, caused by their ""tailes"". But it could just be my Moto X 2013 that recently got Lollipop and may have some problems.  What really ""scares"" me, that the games get even harder. What I mean, is that the characters aren't areas anymore, only transparent areas with borders, which makes spotting of obstacles more complicated. But I hope this, plus power ups could nevertheless improve the other games!  Edit: OK, playing Ding Dong for 20 minutes, I start liking the whole colour range and the particle effects when the obstacles crush into the borders. And my bad, the areas aren't transparent, they are the same grey as the background, which makes them appear transparent. I don't know what the others say, but it still ""annoys"" me a bit (sorry for the bunch of quotation marks, I'm from Germany and my English isn't that fluent, so it's sometimes hard to find the right words)."

You will be awarded a point for each succesful move. The game becomes faster and more challenging the more points you have. There are also some powerups that appear every so often that will help you out.

If you could label any game with the same view port and control scheme as ""blank-like"" you'd never get any useful information out of it!"
AndroidGaming,3b40m6,tstorm004,2,Fri Jun 26 13:34:54 2015 UTC,Umm maybe this game is a bit different than the GBA version I played years ago. But that game was most definitely a hell of a lot like GTA 1&2

AndroidGaming,3b1u62,syzygyz,2,Thu Jun 25 14:22:17 2015 UTC,Am I the only one that was disappointed from this game? I actually bought it on a sale for 1.99 at some point and it took me about an hour or so to finish the game. There is no replay-ability as it's only a single way to finish a chapter and although the graphics are really nice it seems to me like this game is way too over hyped. The game you buy is also not the full version as it has IAP in the game (I know it was free and definitely get it when it's free but I would not pay much for this game)  Just my two cents on this game.
AndroidGaming,3b1u62,romantic_boy,2,Fri Jun 26 12:22:13 2015 UTC,Nabbed this last time. How do you access new content: Ida's Dream?

Apparently, the Amazon version comes with extra content. Can I install the Ida's Dream content onto that version? Or will I need to remove the Play version and install the Amazon version?"

The Sarah Northway game was interesting and nice to look at, but the gameplay wasn't enough to keep me interested.  Got through the first handful of levels and wasn't captured by the gameplay.

AndroidGaming,3b3e6j,Brarsh,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:13:35 2015 UTC,"It can depend on what type of game it is. Most casual games don't need that extra screen space, or get rid of on screen nav buttons to achieve their goals.  High graphics games of course should do this because they are looking for immersion and don't want anything breaking the visual continuity.  Some games might also use the back button to avoid extra buttons in the game itself. People know where the back button is and what it does, so sometimes it's just simpler using that instead.  Because your phone doesn't have off-screen buttons isn't a reason to fault a game.  To uninstall a game just because it shows a bar with navigation buttons?  That's a little harsh."

Analog sticks are great, they have click buttons underneath, there are analog triggers and digital bumpers on the shoulders as well. It's just curvy enough to be comfy, yet flat enough to pocket. It's powered by a rechargeable battery with a decent capacity and comes with an optional short cable to allow the phone to draw power from the controller. It drastically reduces the battery life of the controller (maybe 2-3 hours of play max opposed to 20+ when the controller isn't charging the phone), but at the benefit of not having your phone half empty from a gaming session. It also has a clip in the center that's completely flush with the controller but folds out to hold your phone for truly portable gaming. The clip expands enough that it can hold most phablets with a case even as long as it's a very slim case.   I'm not affiliated with moga at all, just a hardcore gamer. Do yourself a favor and check this out first. It absolutely will blow away anything in its price range, I assure you"
AndroidGaming,3b3b5s,Tyr808,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:33:17 2015 UTC,Iv seen a few people mention this. I'm pretty new to wanting to play seriously on android. Do you have to map this controller? Or is more like if it works it works for a game.
AndroidGaming,3b3b5s,Tyr808,2,Thu Jun 25 22:46:32 2015 UTC,"It has two Bluetooth modes. One is their proprietary mode, one is a generic Bluetooth device mode. Mode A is the moga enhanced mode where any game that supports it will simply work right away with zero mapping. Mode B is a generic Bluetooth input device mode. Both work just as well, and some of my games that aren't moga enhanced (no mode A) even work perfectly out of the box on mode B (this is when the game has controller support, but wasn't developed surgically for moga). If the game has no controller support at all but I still want to use a controller, I use an app called Tincore. It's EXTREMELY powerful and let's you map any button, stick, or dpad movement to any tap, swipe, pattern, etc to the touchscreen and seems to have zero input delay, but these are profiles you will have to set up for yourself manually. There are other apps that do this same function as well. I don't know which one is considered the best, but I'm comfortable with advanced software so I prefer the complexity Tincore offers.  Having to custom map a profile for a game will be an issue for any controller out there if the app doesn't support a controller on its own though. Mapping isn't bad by any means though. Takes a minute or two and only has to be done once per app.   I find that most games that feel like they'd play better on controller tend to support controllers these days anyways.  Out of the 6 games on my phone I play with a controller, only 1 needed a custom mapping, and out of the various 20 something games I've tried, only 3 or 4 needed mapping, and one of those wasn't intended for controller play anyway, I just wanted to see if it worked."

AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,Tuberomix,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"I was talking with a friend the other day.  I really wish Apple would release some of their services for Android, like iMessage and Continuity.  If I could use those, I would probably buy an iPad just for the games."
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,WellTimedPoop,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:49:05 2015 UTC,"Well they will of course have their reasons for keeping their services to themselves, making people get used and rely more on their platform. It works too - I often read on people who like staying on iOS thanks to all their friends using iMessage (I never met someone like that IRL though, since everyone here just uses WhatsApp).  However, the last WWDC actually showed Apple opening up a little bit, with Apple Music being announced for Android too plus the Swift programming language being made open-source (which also means it would work on non-Apple platforms).  Though Ion't think that means we'll see iMessage on Android though, and certainly not Continuity."
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,Tuberomix,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:16:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree with you.  And I might be a fringe case, but I wonder how many people would buy other apple peripherals if they could use services like iMessage and Continuity on non-iOS devices.  I've also looked into buying a Mac, but I decided against it because the latest versions of OS X have really tight iOS integration, and I don't have any iOS devices."
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,WellTimedPoop,2,Thu Jun 25 14:19:28 2015 UTC,"Well in general I believe Apple wants to keep people in their controlled platform. On the other hand I agree that having some well-designed cross-platform stuff could also convince people to give in to the full Apple ecosystem.   I've also looked into buying a Mac, but I decided against it because the latest versions of OS X have really tight iOS integration, and I don't have any iOS devices.   I don't see how this a good reason. It's not that you lose anything (other than money spent haha), it's just that you don't gain this Continuity thing which you don't really have anyway (though Android has some decent alternatives - such as Pushbullet - which work on Mac too). Of course what Apple really wants is for someone to buy a Mac, loving it and then later getting tempted to buy an iPhone (or and iPad too!) to fully giving in to the platform and being able to take advantage of useful features like Continuity..."
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,Tuberomix,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:37:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pushbullet is definitely great, and I love it now.  but being able to take phonecalls from your computer is so awesome.  I want that."

But to be fair I think the blame in this case is actually on Google; I think Apple couldn't make Continuity work with Android anyway. But Google, they could have a feature like that too (and actually I'm wondering now why they haven't done it yet)."
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,Tuberomix,2,Thu Jun 25 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah... that's a good point.  I guess most of my blame should be put on Google.  I just feel unsatisfied with Android lately, but I've spent too much money on apps to have to start over again on iOS"
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,WellTimedPoop,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:49:12 2015 UTC,I've spent too much money on apps to have to start over again on iOS   Haha this is exactly the kind of benefit I was talking about that makes people stick to the platform they're already used to.
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,Tuberomix,2,Thu Jun 25 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"It definitely is.  I mean, there are plenty of reasons to stick with Android (I really like playing emulators with my sixaxis controller, and blocking ads), but lollipop is so slow for me, and the battery life is so bad, and there are so many games that never come to Android that I've seriously considered iOS.  According to MyPaidApps, I've spent $481.65 on apps.   I'm sure most of these apps I wouldn't buy again on iOS, but there's probably $100 or so in apps I would need to re-buy because I regularly use."

As I said to someone in another thread who was ranting about how bad the Play Store is, you just have to browse sites like androidpolice.com or this sub to find good games.  There are plenty of full fledged, IAP-free games out there, you just need to know where to look."
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,rube,3,Thu Jun 25 01:42:34 2015 UTC,"There are even some free, full-fledged, zero ads or IAP games, like Tiny Dangerous Dungeons, <insert adjective> Pixel Dungeon, Commander Genius, OpenTyrian, QIII4A + OpenArena game data, Vector Pinball, XRick, plus product tie-ins like Lego games or 300, which are still free games with zero ads or IAP.  On PC you can spend like several years playing only free games, on Android that scene is small but slowly grows, especially open-source games."

AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,braden26,18,Thu Jun 25 12:52:47 2015 UTC,Tablets and phones got more powerful and porting an existing game costs much less than making a new one.   So there's less of a need to hit high sales numbers.

AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,thermoplastics,9,Thu Jun 25 15:54:59 2015 UTC,Crashlands comes out soon.Looks good.
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,Dedlifto,3,Thu Jun 25 01:30:02 2015 UTC,"According to their blog, they offer for IAP:   Beds which can be slept in to shift time forward 6 hours (not in real life, we're not that advanced...YET)  The Anger Omelet - a breakfast snack you can cook for your pets to buff them with Berserking  Bombs (including seedbombs and harvestbombs)  The Thro-Pipe - a blow pipe that, when swung, hurls a poisonous dart at enemies   So, timer skips, buffs, weapons and more.  Looks decidedly less good now."
AndroidGaming,3b0ifu,thermoplastics,2,Thu Jun 25 10:16:12 2015 UTC,"They also say this about those enrichment's.   Paying players can buy the full game with a one-time IAP that unlocks every Enrichment recipe forever, including any we patch in later. This also unlocks HARDCORE MODE, which allows the game to be played with Player permadeath and Pet permadeath. This IAP will rise in cost to reflect the growing value of the game as systems expand and more content is added, so getting in early might not be a bad idea!   But really it is unclear, a whole blog post on this and they don't bother to clarify anything. They do say there is a full game unlock that gets the player all the recipes, but what you posted does sound like those are more than recipes as they sound like complete items. So will we be able to craft a bed (to move time faster), how difficult will it be to craft?  I would imagine it won't be easy in order to have incentive to just purchase one. Frankly this is what I have been afraid of as they were never clear on how they would do IAP (over the course of the last year or two every time I asked).  Of course I could be wrong and maybe the game is balanced well for full paying customers. I guess we will have to wait and see."

There is a lot of, what could be termed as 'full' games around and more and more coming.  It just needs a shift in android gamers attitude to these types of games and that they should not expect these quality titles to be available for around 0.99p.  We see on here a lot that when a quality game comes out with no IAP and is a true full game, a lot of users come on to say 'OMGZOR!!1! £14.99 is too expensive'  There is a cycle of development/purchasing that needs to be supported by us gamers, if we want to keep seeing this sort of trend in android gaming, we need to put our hands in our virtual pockets and fork out the cash for these titles."

Every Nexus handheld needs it in order to play full screen. Which by the way are supposed to be ""the"" development devices for Android OS. It's been two years since the release of 4.4 and immersive mode, get with it people."

AndroidGaming,3b15cd,thermoplastics,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:33:04 2015 UTC,It hides the nav and notification bar so the game can be played full screen.

As an LG G3 owner I'm surprised companies haven't copied their 'hide home buttons' feature, it's very useful for many app. I hope enough people complain to get this feature on most apps."
AndroidGaming,3b15cd,thermoplastics,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:00:26 2015 UTC,"It was actually implemented by Google with 4.4, two years ago. At this stage it does appear as though most devs will not bother or even know it exists. Sadly Google not having forced design standards is a double edged sword. Devs get freedom and we get more apps cause of it, but the lack of polish when it comes to anything Android is becoming too much of an issue anymore."

AndroidGaming,3b26bm,Redicus,11,Thu Jun 25 10:53:40 2015 UTC,"Yes and no. It depends on how fast you want a competitive deck. You can craft a ""face hunter"", rush paladin, or zoo warlock (Google them) all for relatively cheap. The game has a ranking system and hidden match make rating for an attempt to match you up to someone of your relative strength.   The biggest problem with HS nowdays is it's hard for newcomers to catch up considering there has been 1 expansion pack, and 2 adventures  (that reward more cards) that either require $$ or about 2,000 gold to unlock. IMO, Blizzard should start offering some discounts even if they are small or some package deals like being able to buy both adventures at a discount.  The game is more Pay for variety than pay to win."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,Andro30,5,Thu Jun 25 12:14:09 2015 UTC,I see. So will i be able to compete/win games? Or will i lose more than i win?  I just want the game to be unbiased. And to be not too much grinding.
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,shsourov,6,Thu Jun 25 13:19:24 2015 UTC,you'll lose more than you win. but after a while it will even out
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,Jubag,2,Thu Jun 25 13:36:58 2015 UTC,"Ive just started playing HS i have spent a little cash not much bought like 4 packs, but there's enough ways to earn free cards whether you lose or win, if you play ranked you get a better match up of skill and decks, ive found that casual gets you people with crazy good decks that destroy you"
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,n0tj0sh33,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:56:53 2015 UTC,"You just have lose enough until you understand the game, also pick out one class and stick with it, makes it easier to focus on learning how to to play."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,Andro30,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:20:27 2015 UTC,You will be ~50% win rate unless you have a variety of decks that can react to the meta game. For example a control warrior deck will hard counter certain rush decks but it costs A Lot of dust to craft. Of course your win rate is dependent on skill too. A good player can still get legend rank with hunter alone
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,Tuberomix,2,Thu Jun 25 13:34:40 2015 UTC,Wait so you're telling even a beginner can already win half the time?!
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,MOONGOONER,2,Thu Jun 25 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"I got it a month ago. For each class you have to grind a bit to get the basic cards. I end up playing basic decks (nothing bought)  until I get there and I win a decent amount of games. I definitely lose plenty, but it's a multi-player game, there's always going to be a loser."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,mindsnare,2,Thu Jun 25 18:34:37 2015 UTC,That's how the matchmaking is supposed to work.
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,shsourov,3,Fri Jun 26 02:03:35 2015 UTC,almost half. it's like if you play 10 game you'll win at least 3 guaranteed unless you make dumb choices. and if you're lucky you'll win 6 our of 10 but then next batch will be hard so you won't probably win 6 from the immediate next batch
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,Tuberomix,6,Thu Jun 25 16:28:21 2015 UTC,"Well I thought it was weird because how could you beat 50℅ of the time when most of the players are already experienced?  But now I figure this means the game must have some matchmaking system, so complete beginners could only be matched with other complete beginners..."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,commenter_on_reddit,5,Thu Jun 25 17:53:03 2015 UTC,"It has matchmaking, and IMO it works really well. When I started playing I was actually winning a lot more than 50%, because I was getting matched against other new players and they didn't understand how to play as well as I did. I had played a lot of Magic: The Gathering as a kid, and the games are close enough that I started out better at Hearthstone than them.  For instance, a lot of players wouldn't use their hero power so they'd run out of cards really quickly. Others would play as many cards as they could every turn even if I already had stuff on the board which could clear them out the next turn."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,HnNaldoR,3,Thu Jun 25 21:00:39 2015 UTC,"It's not pay to win.   If you want to just play around, it is essentially free. You can grind for cards slowly.   If you want to play seriously, consider it pay to play. It's like a $40 game considering the cards/expansions. It's fantastic but definitely not cheap.   It is by no means p2w through. More good cards do not really help you as long as you can get 1 good competitive deck."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,alexe0108,3,Thu Jun 25 14:55:51 2015 UTC,"If you wanna play ranked, it is pay to win. Beside that it's very enjoyable. Now they added Tavern Brawl which is pretty fun and you get a free card pack every week (you need to win one game in Tavern Brawl in order to receive it).   Anyway, after a while, you can compete in ranked even if you don't spend money."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,blazerk,2,Thu Jun 25 15:01:46 2015 UTC,No more than Magic: The Gathering or any other TCG is pay to win.
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,OhSeven,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:40:05 2015 UTC,Less if you consider that there's no cost to the standard cards and even rare cards can be earned for free.
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,LimeGreenTeknii,2,Thu Jun 25 22:49:09 2015 UTC,"I know that arena and single player are paid, but that's not a matter of pay-to-win; it's a matter of pay-to-play. There's no way to pay to get any type of advantage in arena, no power-ups, no extra cards, nothing. Single player is fair too. You don't need fancy cards or anything; you just have to build decks around the bosses you meet.  For casual mode, it certainly won't be an issue, if you just want to do matches for fun and that's it, not worrying about your rank. As for ranked mode, you can't lower in rank at the lower levels, so if all you want is the monthly card-back, you just need to play a certain number of games until you win enough times. I don't think there's any type of reward for getting above that; the rest is just for pride, but even that resets every month.  Card packs are random for everybody anyway, and you can earn gold to get them anyway, and you can always get rid of cards you don't want for cards you do want using dust.  Either way, Hearthstone does not deserve the bad reputation it gets here. I think the people who dislike it are judging a book by its cover."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,Meloku171,2,Thu Jun 25 23:55:26 2015 UTC,"Hearthstone is a game of patience if you don't want to spend any money. Thanks to the daily missions, you can easily earn a booster pack every two days if you only play for those, and websites like Icy Veins have deck builds that don't even require anything besides the free cards you get by playing Practice matches and leveling up each hero.  If you want to spend as little as humanly possible, I suggest you to try a Face Hunter deck. It's the best cost/effectiveness ratio you can get. But be prepared to grind for a month or two.  Also, check Icy Veins for the Basic Paladin deck based on the Mid Range archetype. It doesn't need ANY money and it has a decent w/l ratio on Casual play."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,mboarder,2,Fri Jun 26 04:11:08 2015 UTC,"depends on how you want to play , if you can't bare the thought of losing or grinding endlessly then these games are not exactly friendly for your wallet. I have seen the extent in forums to which people will go to win or be in the top leaderboards and to be honest it's just not worth it for your average casual player to even try and jump in unless you were there from day 1 and have been playing every day since."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,commenter_on_reddit,3,Fri Jun 26 07:21:06 2015 UTC,"Hearthstone is not at all pay to win unless you're trying to climb the ranked ladder, which resets every month and only rewards you with a cosmetic back for your cards. In the casual mode the matchmaking algorithm will make sure that the people you play against are on your level.   So theoretically if you spent $10,000 and made a deck entirely of ultra-rare cards you'd win a bunch of matches in a row, then the system would figure out how good your deck is and you'll be stabilized at a ~50% win rate (unless you have literally the best deck in the world).  I've been playing Hearthstone at least a couple days a week for about 6 months without spending a cent, and I like it. I have spent most of the in-game currency I got from playing on the Arena and some on unlocking more single-player content."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,JJGIII,2,Thu Jun 25 13:23:28 2015 UTC,Is the single player content unlock a one time unlock?
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,commenter_on_reddit,2,Thu Jun 25 19:34:45 2015 UTC,"As opposed to paying for it each time you play it? Yes, it is a one time unlock. But if you're spending the in-game currency that you earn for playing, each single player campaign is a whole bunch of unlocks. Each unlock gets you 3 new AI opponents and I think each of those gives you two copies of a card (or one copy of a really good card) the first time you beat them. After you beat all 3 a challenge against each with an assigned deck is unlocked, and after you beat those you get an extremely hard challenge.  What I like the most about the single player is that it doesn't have time limits, so I can start a single-player match and wander off for 5 or 10 minutes whenever I feel like."
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,JJGIII,2,Thu Jun 25 20:55:51 2015 UTC,"Ah OK I started playing but never figured it out and was wondering, thank you"
AndroidGaming,3b26bm,Ulfur69,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:11:22 2015 UTC,"It is a bit pay to win. But more like pay to increase your odds of winning. Just buying a bunch of stuff is not enough to win. Someone with a better deck is always favored but a mediocre deck played well still has a chance, learning to play is just as important as having good cards.  I just want to say that the game can feel a bit unforgiving for new players because you will inevitably go up against people with both better decks and more experience. It's tough but if you keep at it, perhaps buy the adventures for some solid cards, get one good deck together and start winning some games. You will earn enough gold to buy like a pack of 5 random cards every day or every other day, depending on time and which daily quests you get. Or enter arena for a chance of even better rewards.   So once you get over the initial hump you can progress quite nicely without paying anything. Besides, collecting the cards you want is a good carrot to make playing the game even more rewarding. Since you can also craft cards from arcane dust gained from disenchanting other cards (duplicates and such) you can eventually get any cards you want. I really do think this is a thing that keeps me coming back to the game, so I actually don't feel inclined to spend a lot of money on cards."

I've only had the chance to play with the one you begin with so I can't say anything on their differences.   10 missions in total. I've only played 1 and it was short, decent level design. I don't know if there are more as bonus levels but I hope the devs add more later on.   The Google Play support is great. Cloudsaves, leaderboards and achievement support.   The graphics setting is something I wish more developers would support. Options for 60fps, detail options, and resolution settings.   I had many crashes with my LG G3, I emailed the devs my problem, I don't know how responsive they are. If you purchase it and you have these problems just go for the refund and message the devs then wait. It worked great with my Galaxy Tab 3 though so I didn't refund my purchase."

AndroidGaming,3axrdn,CircumcisedSpine,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:14:48 2015 UTC,Do you have to be rooted to sideload apps?
AndroidGaming,3axrdn,i_know_my_writes,2,Wed Jun 24 15:45:13 2015 UTC,No. You just have to tick a box in the settings that allows you to install apps from 'unknown sources'.
AndroidGaming,3axrdn,skipjimroo,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:30:34 2015 UTC,"Nope. As said elsewhere, sideloading is a standard Android feature. Depending on your phone manufacturer and Android version, the 'Allow unknown sources' option may be worded or located differently. It's usually under Security but sometimes it is under Apps.   It allows you to install an APK (android app package file from which apps are installed) from any source. This means other markets like the Amazon App Store or F-Droid in addition to apks you find elsewhere online.   Some things will require root (basically permission  to do more to the OS and file system than   the standard user account), which is readily available for the NST (but not necessarily every device -- my Verizon  Note 3 will lose root and cannot get it back if I upgrade passed 4.4.2, dicks)."

AndroidGaming,3axrdn,CircumcisedSpine,3,Wed Jun 24 14:13:20 2015 UTC,"No problem. The promise of XCOM on the go was about 80% of my decision to buy the Shield Tablet, so imagine my surprise when the best Android gaming platform wasn't compatible with the best Android game (imo).   Haven't used GLTools for any other games. To be honest, I barely understand what it does; I just followed the steps in that post and loaded up XCOM.

AndroidGaming,3axrdn,goblygoop,-3,Wed Jun 24 23:15:24 2015 UTC,The randomness in combat ruined this game for me
AndroidGaming,3axrdn,WeeklysForDays,5,Wed Jun 24 12:09:33 2015 UTC,The whole theme of the game is playing with the unknown. I think it fits perfectly.
AndroidGaming,3axrdn,Copernican,6,Wed Jun 24 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"It's a fair criticism. There's a world of difference between random opportunities and random results.  It's actually one of the bigger differences in modern board games vs. classic board games. Random opportunities are very common. Different things available in a given round, different ways to score bonus points, etc. The important thing is, the randomness happens before you've made your decision, and you know what the immediate outcome of whatever decision you make will be.  This is in contrast to many classic board games, most RPGs, and, yes, Xcom. In these, you make your decision (I'm going to attack that guy) and then find out whether you succeed.  Neither approach is inherently better or worse, but many people find the latter form of randomness less satisfying. I don't particularly mind it in Xcom, but nor do I think it's especially thematic. I think the game would work just as well without randomized chances for success.  There's a great roguelite called Invisible Inc. which feels very much like Xcom, but with an emphasis on stealth instead of combat. It's firmly in the random opportunity camp, though; the levels are randomly generated, but the effects of the decisions you make are always consistent and predictable. If you attack a guard, he will be knocked out (assuming he doesn't have some trait that prevents it, like armor, but even that's known ahead of time)."
AndroidGaming,3axrdn,Asmor,4,Wed Jun 24 16:34:30 2015 UTC,"Personally I like the randomness as it forces you to to deal with contingency. There's a reason why I hate the boardgame Pandemic, but love Defenders of the Realm. Both are nearly identical, except that in order to remove minions/plague from the board in DoR, you have to roll a d6 to attack. It solves the ""quarterbacking"" issue in pandemic as a co-op, but also is great because it forces you to take risk and adapt your turn accordingly. The thing is the randomness isn't completely blind. You know your odds and attack ranges. X-Com does a good job of representing that.  That said I think it's interesting that a mutator in the game allows you to increase the random range of attack damage, but their is no mutator to make everything predictable and determined."
AndroidGaming,3axrdn,Copernican,2,Wed Jun 24 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"That said I think it's interesting that a mutator in the game allows you to increase the random range of attack damage, but their is no mutator to make everything predictable and determined.   Completely agreed about this. In fact, I actually thought there was one for removing the randomness, and I was going to tell the poster above about it but I decided to double check just in case I was wrong. Glad I did, saved me from looking like an idiot."

Imagine if you lived in a rural area, where there was one portal within walking distance and only four more without having to jump on a highway of sorts. Now imagine the one within 'walking distance' is labeled as 1.1km away, according to the app. Now imagine that the app doesn't take height into account and that 1.1km is more like 1.8km. For walking, not a big difference in distance. For driving though, that's bad. VERY bad.  This is why I have a love/hate relationship with Ingress. Took me about three months to get to level 2, and another four months to get to level 3. Not played the past two months much (summer break, am being lazy)."

Astro Empires - think if EVE but no graphics. You essentially build up multiple bases and ships. Fights are one clickish events but when big battles occur it can be lots of fun.   Runs 24/7 with structures etc taking hours or days to complete. Great for logging in every 6 hours or so to fill queues and look for fights.   It is free to play with limited structures but only 20 euros for a years subs.   Let me know if you are interested and I  can see if there is an account free to be taken over in my team.

AndroidGaming,3b00my,kynanisawesome,2,Wed Jun 24 21:41:01 2015 UTC,"Similar to what /u/Switchblade1080 says, I feel it centers around a perfect mixture of depth and minimalism.  Minimalism in that the game boots in seconds, can be immediately closed with either instasaving or no particular consequence anyway, has fluid controls, an easy to learn/remember formula of gameplay, and a solid hook.  Depth in that the game has infinite/insanely high replayability, hours of buried content you may not uncover for months, unique and interesting strategies/areas/mechanics that emerge more and more with play, and lovable/beautiful aesthetic style from start to finish.  My personal opinion is that these two points most often reach their perfect balance in the Roguelike genre - games like DC:SS and NetHack, for example, will have you delving for months or years before you finally ascend, and there is so much to do in between, yet due to their small footprint they can be stored, booted, saved and loaded with ease, making them the ultimate mobile games."

AndroidGaming,3av73a,AntediluvianEmpire,7,Tue Jun 23 22:00:30 2015 UTC,"The problem with Google Play is that it's so much drown in shovelware that it's really hard to find quality content.  Google is supposed to be good at search, when they arrived on the search engine market they crushed the competition because they were the only one not drown in spam. Why can't they do that for Google Play??"
AndroidGaming,3av73a,erwan,2,Wed Jun 24 07:37:55 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately the majority of Android users disagree with you and me, and most others in the gaming subreddits.  The casuals that love to play farmville games, bewjewed clones, and gambling are the majority, and Google and Apple are making an insane amount of money from these people.  Google really does need a curated section to highlight paid apps and promote the indie games, and I think it would help a lot to give ""hardcore"" gamers a place to look for something they know won't just be another Flappy Bird/Bejeweled/Clash of game.  Google could quite easily hire an intern to curate this section."
AndroidGaming,3av73a,dandmcd,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:08:27 2015 UTC,Try alternatives like the  Curated app. Seriously.
AndroidGaming,3av73a,royalbarnacle,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:37:32 2015 UTC,"I agree, but there's much exploiting of the system to drown out the good stuff. The amusing thing is that this has also been the case in the past when going to brick and mortar stores, which is why we had things like Nintendo Power and PCGamer to tell us what was worth looking at. Shovelware permeated the shelves and you had to sift through things, without the ability of being able to return the $80 game (if your parents bought it for you in the first place) you just got.   In any industry, it's hard to find the quality content and I can only imagine trying to write an algorithm to filter out ""quality"", when you can pay someone to review your game at five stars and then make several clones and similarly drive them up the charts. It's the same concept that many big businesses use in their own industry; look at Bud Light for example. They have so many different variations on packaging, solely for the purpose of taking up shelf space and making the consumer more likely to purchase that product. You have to delve deep into the craft beer scene if you want to find the ""quality content"".   I don't disagree with you, I just think it's far more difficult than we might imagine."
AndroidGaming,3av73a,AntediluvianEmpire,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"I know it's difficult, but Google became successful specifically because they managed to fix the problem for the open web. It's supposed to be what they're good at.  Which is why if you search for the name of a website, you get that in front page and not a bunch of unrelated spammy web pages. Even if the website is not very popular But on the Play store, if you search for the exact name of a fairly unknown app, you get random results that have absolutely nothing to do with the search term.  It should be easier for apps, where they control the friggin store!"
AndroidGaming,3av73a,erwan,4,Wed Jun 24 15:15:28 2015 UTC,And it's our choice if we want to consume it or not. So I don't get it when someone says why things exist. Honestly sounds like something only idiots say

AndroidGaming,3av73a,MLGsallados,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:38:39 2015 UTC,"atari 2600   Upon further reflection, I think it was actually the Atari 5200, as the graphics of that more closely match my memories than that of the 2600.   But the Atari was our primary system until we one Christmas got an NES, which was a fucking revelation for the both of us. Though, her being 7 years older than me caused some problems when it came to gaming, because she was much better than me. Where I'd die immediately, she'd play for what seemed like hours and I'd never get my turn."

You should make screenshots that don't include the banner ads (even if its the test banner ad) It's just more attractive to the potential user base. You could also stand to have another screenshot or two. I usually aim for at least 5.  You should also look into adding flags for the Android Immersive mode It really imrpoves the overall look of the game when you can get those pesky bars out of the way too.  Gameplay wise, a neat and easy concept. Its my type of simple one note game. Good job."

We didn't do anything out of our way to make it compatible, so unless Unity has some built-in funcionality for it, it is not supported.  Thanks for the idea. Do you only game on Android TV, or do you also game on your smartphone/tablet?"
AndroidGaming,3au3g0,docstarr,2,Tue Jun 23 15:39:24 2015 UTC,"I have an android tablet and I game on it some. I normally play mobile games on my iPhone 6. But I bought a Nvidia Shield TV and  have been playing a lot on it. It's a great device  EDIT:  There is a Unity game I play on iOS and Android that the play store showed as computable with my Nvidia shield TV.   However, after installing it the controller did not work. I have been meaning to test a wired XBox 360 controller to see if that worked.   EDIT 2: The Play store does list your game as compatible so I installed it. I will give it a test run tonight."
AndroidGaming,3au3g0,docstarr,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:33:43 2015 UTC,The controls don't work on android TV. You can start the game if you hook up a mouse but you can't really play it.
AndroidGaming,3au3g0,bloodhorde,2,Wed Jun 24 01:12:58 2015 UTC,It's an awesome game... I loved it. It would be nice if you changed the control scheme to touch instead of using the accelerometer.

AndroidGaming,3av2rp,PlayStoreLinks__Bot,2,Wed Jun 24 01:56:45 2015 UTC,"While I agree ""yes"" is a sufficient answer, I'll expound a bit.   The game is a full fledged RPG with a self contained story (devs said this is the first of a series). It has deep customization where your character can develop into anything (I made a spell slinging archer for example). The advertised 12 hours completion is very accurate and the content doesn't feel boring or rehashed. The locations are varied (there's a slums, an uptown, an oasis, a desert, a lot of different tiled caves, etc.) and each one has a very distinct atmosphere.   The characters in the story felt just right for a mobile game. Each of the mercs you get have their own story (sadly no NPC quests to further build their character) and their own fighting style. There's also a dog lol. If you've played Dragon Age, the combat is similar to that. The 3 traditional classes (fighter, rogue, mage) are present and you can mix and match them however you like.  The graphics are also really good, provided your phone can handle it. I toned it down to minimum to keep my phone from exploding but the graphics are still a lot better than most games on Android.  I really enjoyed my time with the game and would recommend it to people that like western RPGs.  TL;DR: The game feels like a Dragon Age game for mobile."

It's genuinely one of my favorite action games on Android. Very smooth, polished, funny, and fun.   And the guys at Butterscotch Shenanigans are really cool. They're working on some other great games, too.

AndroidGaming,3aske5,SlightlyManic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:04:58 2015 UTC,"Hands down one of my favorite action games on Android. Great hack and slash. IAPs are never necessary for Butterscotch Shenanigans games (but they are an option, QR was the first and only Android game that I completely finished and cleared and then bought a ton of IAPs because I wanted to throw money at the devs/screen for all the fun I had) unless it's a one-time unlock after the 'free trial' content.   Another great action game from Butterscotch is Towelfight 2: The Monocle of Destiny. It's kinda like Zelda (less so)  meets Binding of Isaac (more so), without permadeath and with persistent map. When you die, you go back to the start but can see where you have been on your map yet each room will be randomly repopulated again. Ton of fun, also well done. And you'll recognize some friends from QR.   And they have a lot more in the works... Good guys.  Linkme: Towelfight 2"

The anime/magazine mogul are pretty much copy and paste game Dev but still a lot of fun.

AndroidGaming,3avcwx,NotADamsel,3,Tue Jun 23 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"A mix of Idle Oil Tycoon (game continues even if closed or phone off since its clock dependent) and a shop sim (get items, sell them in a shop but the shop is idle and auto tended you just drop stuff and it gets sold)  And that looks like a kairosoft game,,,, basically beasty bay but with and idle mode and shop mechanics where the building aspect does not really affect stats of your character... If done properly I would pay the same as a kairosoft game for it ($4.99) :( I WOULD but I dunno how many other people would pay for it - I'm actually hunting for a alpha or beta of something like this"

AndroidGaming,3avcwx,lukazaz,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:31:25 2015 UTC,"Huh... that does sound kind of cool. A shop-keep game, but with an RPG element, could be rather interesting. It could incorporate a clicker/idle mechanic for when you're not around (hired a manager?), but unlike most clicker games your player contributions wouldn't be useless after the first few stages.  I'm going to give this some thought, but the ball is certainly rolling."
AndroidGaming,3avcwx,lukazaz,2,Tue Jun 23 22:09:49 2015 UTC,"You got the idea!! Lets say you start with X number or looters/heroes and send them out the take X time to get random loot plus a ""fixed"" amount of currency add here the manager or guild boss that manages the idle aspect once you unlock the game plays itself when closed (time based similar to how idle oil tycoon works - I think it has the best representation of what Idle means) plus you hero/looter that you control (with RPG aspects) can also be sent out to get ""stuff"" but it requires you to play/battle...  If you make the game I would love to alpha/beta test (this thing or any games you make) :)"
AndroidGaming,3avcwx,lukazaz,3,Tue Jun 23 22:46:23 2015 UTC,"The narrative framing I'm considering is that you're a mighty adventurer in typical RPG world, and you've saved up enough to open your own shop. It is managed by your trusty side-kick, and throughout the game you can give him raises and increase his operating budget in order to improve his performance. Your manager hires adventurers, contracts with local craftsmen, etc, leaving some decisions up to you. As you are, indeed, the shop owner, you can mark certain blueprints as ""make one and save it for me"", which will allow you to basically equip yourself with the finest kit that the town you're in has to offer. As far as the active play aspect, I'm strongly considering a variant on the tried-and-true turn-based JRPG system, as I think that it best fits with the single-tap stop-and-think gameplay that the rest of the game will require. As far as loot goes, normal crafting materials will drop, but also rare loot! If you or a hired adventurer finds an above-common-rarity item, your manager will ask you what to do with them the next time you load up the shop interface. I am hoping that the RPG gear system will keep the player character up-to-snuff with their AI auto-player allies, as the one thing I hate about most clicker games is that after a while you're basically useless."

AndroidGaming,3avk9e,darthvalium,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:11:46 2015 UTC,"Every user in Hattrick has a team of his/her own. The user has wide control over their team, and gameplay is mainly limited by economic and tactical restrictions. Many different types of teams exist within Hattrick; the team's type is generally shaped by the training program set up by the user, as well as the formations played.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattrick  There is also /r/hattrick but it's not very active. They now have an Android app so I figured I post here to hear what reddit has to say about it.   Hattrick originally started out as a browser game in 1997. I've been playing since 2007 and I obviously think it's an amazing game, otherwise I wouldn't have held on to my team for so long. Hattrick moves at a rather slow pace. Your team has two matches per week, and a season lasts 16 weeks. At the end you can advance to a higher league or be demoted. There's also a national cup system in place.   You don't have to be a football expert to enjoy Hattrick but the mechanics of the economy and training and match engine are quite complex, and the learning curve is steep at the beginning. Best for newbies would be to go to the active forums and ask for help, I guess. When I started I had someone showing me the ropes. They just started a mentoring program so newbies could resort to that as well.  It has been struggling with declining user numbers since 2009 but I still love this game.They still cling to their freemium model where you can by so-called ""hattrick supporter"" (which, I have to admit, has become quite expensive). This package removes ads and enables certain cosmetic features to the game as well as seperate ""Tournaments"", in which you can play additional matches that don't count for the ""normal"" economy of hattrick. So you don't get in-game advantages from being a supporter but it improves the experience."

Imagine a persistent world that's massive in size, with beacons that control a specific amount of area. This becomes incredibly competitive and rewarding. It has all the same feature from previous castle building games like neutral resource camps and hundreds of items to use.   Find the right league or clan, and you'll be protected till level 50, without spending a dime I've advanced fairly far in this game. And without the worry of a new server killing the population down the road. Since the game just started, the highest levels are in the 70-90 range. I've gone from 1-45 in about 10 days."

AndroidGaming,3aundq,JPOnion,2,Tue Jun 23 17:58:24 2015 UTC,"I've never played them, nor have I contributed a vote to either comment, but I think people generally respond negatively to supercell games because of their slimy IAP monetization schemes.  that's what I seem to recall reading around here anyway.  I couldn't care less as I'd much rather just pay up front and get a complete game, as opposed to paying nothing up front for a game with a shit ton of paywalled content.  this is particularly troublesome for games with a significant online component, as it throws any potential for balance out the window.  some people would argue that the very act of supporting devs who operate this way is toxic to gaming in general.  I wouldn't know, but I steer clear simply because you get what you pay for (piracy notwithstanding)"
AndroidGaming,3aundq,unerds,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:23:39 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, and good points.  I don't like IAP's or paywalls either and 99% of the time I avoid games that have anything like that, but I feel SuperCell strikes a nice balance.  Their games are fun and playable without paying for anything, and I've never run across a situation where it felt like I needed gems (the ones I earn just by playing, or ones I can buy with real money) to access content or continue playing.  EDIT: That said, gems do let you speed up troop or building construction so I guess if you want to quickly level up you can spend a lot to do that.  That, I think, is where a lot of their revenue comes from.  However, the matchmaking in Clash of Clans and Boom Beach are pretty good so even if you are matched with someone that spent a lot of money to get where he is you're still matched with someone of about equal power.  In other words, it doesn't feel like the battle is unbalanced because your opponent spent real money."
AndroidGaming,3aundq,JPOnion,0,Wed Jun 24 02:58:44 2015 UTC,"I played it for almost a year (near maxed th8) before I quit, so I'll help explain why its not typically welcome here. It's pay to play. There's about a minimum of 20 mins in between attacks on other players. If you want to keep playing non stop, you have to use gems. This is obviously how they get the game to stretch out for so long, as when you finally do get enough gold/elixir to make an upgrade, you have to wait days to use that item/get that builder to do something else again.   I spent a large amount of time, killing my battery, staring at the screen waiting or talking to people in my clan. I have some good memories from CoC, but I wouldn't recommend it. You can rarely just sit down and play it for an hour or two, because you rarely get to actually play."
AndroidGaming,3aundq,LordKwik,-1,Wed Jun 24 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"More fair points.

Collect gems to increase stats, enchant your armor, do quests to get items. Beat the game? Go to New Game+ were everything gets harder and gives more XP and Gold (items all stay the same)  Personally got to New Game +6 before my usual tricks couldn't beat the last boss."

AndroidGaming,3arpai,CrsIaanix,3,Tue Jun 23 16:52:24 2015 UTC,"1) We went through many iterations of the tutorial after play tests. The problem with giving the option to skip the tutorial is most users will do it and they won't know how to play the game. We tried to make it as minimal as possible.  2) Theses can be turned off at the os level. Settings->apps->battlecore-> uncheck show notifications.  3) Can you give us more details on the glitches? which device and os version do you have? Is it graphical corruption? if so is there a specific place you see it happen?  4) I'm not sure which message you are talking about, can you clarify?  Thanks for the feedback."

'Selling source code' sounds like you want to buy a successful game with some userbase and convert it into a malicious spam app to milk money out of users. And yes, there are several businesses like that.  What you actually propose is publishing and translation services for China market, which is practically not serviced by Play Store.  And you don't actually need sources, unless you are planning to add new levels to the game, you can send translated texts to the dev and they will give you compiled .apk file.  Most such businesses will pay the dev some percent of the app sales, but you are offering lump sum up-front, which could be preferred by some devs.  I've received several emails from different Android app stores from China, so you're not the first one who got that idea."

AndroidGaming,3anzfa,j035u5,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:13:58 2015 UTC,"A stunning rebuttal, I must bow to your insightful addition to the conversation here.  Obviously its personal taste but the SNES dpad (or really any of N's dpads as they're all similar) is very popular for good reason. It feels good under the thumb and its easy to tell from touch where abouts your thumb is. It rocks very well so its good for fighting games, but it doesn't feel sloppy like the 360 pad. It doesn't feel as stiff as the DS/DS2/DS3 (the DS4 is much looser) so its much more comfortable to input quickly. The reason other companies don't use them is that they're patented, otherwise they would all be cross shaped."
AndroidGaming,3anzfa,Lucosis,2,Mon Jun 22 13:31:25 2015 UTC,"I bought their previous NES look-alike controller when it was $20 on some deal site, and it is god awful. Buttons are spongy as hell, and frequently would hit 2 buttons' contacts when pushing one down. Absolutely shitty."
AndroidGaming,3anzfa,nickervision,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:31:47 2015 UTC,"This looks super cool, but for the price, I am not sure its bringing all the right things to the table.   I have two of those ASUS bluetooth controllers for the nexus player. I actually often find I have problems when playing two player games, as though the controllers have weird intermittent signals sometimes. So I am still in the market for something that could be better."

AndroidGaming,3anzfa,MoeHartman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"I have one of these and can confirm that it is indeed a very cool controller. Very light and portable, and compatible with a surprising variety of devices, including most mobile phones and tablets, PC (as X-input or a generic controller), PS3, Wii/Wii U, maybe others. However, mine stopped working after a firmware update went wrong, and it also had a defect that caused the left analog to stick if I pushed it left or up, so I can't whole-heartedly recommend it. It was great while it worked! I did manage to get refunded for my controller, and have considered replacing it, since it was probably just a defective unit, but I'm a bit hesitant, since I already have a DS4, which I could use for mobile gaming. It's worth considering if you don't already have a good controller."
AndroidGaming,3anzfa,Wyrmmountain,4,Mon Jun 22 05:12:09 2015 UTC,"It seems nice, but the only thing this beats a DS4 on is portability. Otherwise, the DS4 is a superior device on every way."

AndroidGaming,3ap5js,thatjubi,5,Mon Jun 22 10:52:42 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've tried so far:   Type: Rider - it's an educational platformer where you traverse landscapes composed of letters and characters. It has information about the history of letters and writing. It's a bit easy as a platformer but it's a nice way to learn about stuff gamers aren't usually interested in. Meltdown - it's almost exactly like the Play Store version, except for one thing: It has no google play integration. No achievements if you play the HB version :( I've played and bought Meltdown twice (on pc and on Android). It's a really fun cover shooter that is cross platform (Android, iOS, and Steam). It becomes a bit grindy at the end but I've never paid anything else past the initial cost to unlock the whole game. It plays well with a moga controller and IPEGA 9025 Mode Y. It plays just fine on touchscreen too.  Pretentious game - If you played Thomas Was Alone, it's quite similar. The game is incredibly simple, but the story it tells is interesting.  It has a lot of surprises that gave me feels.The music absolutely makes the game. However, one thing that irks me is that this game has full screen ads :/ It's not really disruptive of the gameplay, it's just annoying that it pops up after you finish a chapter. Lone Wolf - Read my post about this game here. Personally, I think the BTA tier is worth it for this game alone. Corto Maltese - haven't played yet. Twin Blades - haven't played yet. Dark Lands - a runner where you can fight enemies. Lots of upgrades and this version comes with 6000 free gems. I only played the first 3 levels but I can tell this isn't for me. Aby Escape - haven't played yet. Orborun - this plays kind of like the special stages in Sonic The Hedgehog games.There's a path that you have to go through and there coins and powerups to get along the way. Lots of things to make things interesting like ramps, glass panels to break or avoid and speed boosts. I like that it's only 85 mb but is visually above average. My only complaint is that there's no spinning sound. Jazz: Trump's Journey - a very simple platformer, nothing new, but it does accompany it with some pretty good jazz music. The story presentation and art is very charming too."
AndroidGaming,3ap5js,grawrz,3,Tue Jun 23 04:16:46 2015 UTC,"Lone Wolf alone is worth the price of BTA if you like gamebooks. It is a top tier title like the Sorcery series. I haven't played any of the other games, and frankly am not interested in them, but Lone Wolf would make me buy this bundle."

I play regularly on my iPad and it is by far the best mobile game on the market in my opinion. If you can get into the beta, do it.   Super Evil Megacorp(the devs) are great people who seem to truly care about their player base. The game is free. Characters are purchased through in game currency or premium currency, but there is a stable of free to play characters that changes every week. They update regularly with new characters, bug fixes and new features."
AndroidGaming,3aoye1,SCStrokes,2,Mon Jun 22 13:47:34 2015 UTC,"I loved it but grew disenchanted. The servers are laggy, it can take a long time to find a match and the friend system is buggy.   Metagame wise, it's fantastic. I had played it from release til a few weeks ago and reached rank 1 first week of the first season. I played with a bunch of top players but many of us just don't want to put up with the same issues that've plagued it since release.   It's a very fair game, don't need to purchase anything with real money. Can all be earned or found rather easily. In game communication is limited to pings and most players are idiots. Also, anytime a player drops out - you get a bot. And it's not uncommon to play a match where the majority of the 6 players are bots.   IMO, it's what a MOBA should be on mobile as far as direction goes. Straight action. 10mins or less matches (time limit is 15mins). Team vs team. No creep or mobs.   Having creep in a mobile MOGA is... Ugh. Just ugh. Vainglory is basically LoL for mobile. That may or may not appeal to you but IMO Vainglory is so overrated."

AndroidGaming,3aoa17,LoveRecklessly,2,Mon Jun 22 10:07:52 2015 UTC,"The Vainglory circlejerk in this sub is ridiculous. The one guy who recommended TWBA got downvoted. Jeez.   Here's what I wrote regarding TWBA:  ""I loved it but grew disenchanted. The servers are laggy, it can take a long time to find a match and the friend system is buggy.   Metagame wise, it's fantastic. I had played it from release til a few weeks ago and reached rank 1 first week of the first season. I played with a bunch of top players but many of us just don't want to put up with the same issues that've plagued it since release.   It's a very fair game, don't need to purchase anything with real money. Can all be earned or found rather easily. In game communication is limited to pings and most players are idiots. Also, anytime a player drops out - you get a bot. And it's not uncommon to play a match where the majority of the 6 players are bots.   IMO, it's what a MOBA should be on mobile as far as direction goes. Straight action. 10mins or less matches (time limit is 15mins). Team vs team. No creep or mobs.   Having creep in a mobile MOGA is... Ugh. Just ugh. Vainglory is basically LoL for mobile. That may or may not appeal to you but IMO Vainglory is so overrated. """

And just to add, I don't see how CoC has a ""ridiculous"" paywall. I've been playing for months without paying a single penny.

We've gotten a lot of questions from people assuming that we'll be cramming IAPs into this game, so I figured it warranted a post. Crashlands will be pay-up-front. No monetization of game mechanics.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND that's all!"

They are some fantastic works, and Crashlands looks to top everything you've made so far."
AndroidGaming,3ajn9c,Trajer,7,Sun Jun 21 15:20:30 2015 UTC,Can we pay for more trailers XD?
AndroidGaming,3ajn9c,Squishydew,4,Sun Jun 21 13:38:44 2015 UTC,Technically by buying the game you ARE funding more trailers! We'll likely do one more for launchytimes.
AndroidGaming,3ajn9c,BscotchShenani,2,Sun Jun 21 14:31:05 2015 UTC,Will beta be free?
AndroidGaming,3ajn9c,Kyofo,4,Sun Jun 21 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"[Edited by Adam: We actually aren't at all sure how this is going to work. There are a lot of things we need to take into account. Most important are the test design (e.g. test copies might be incomplete and may have to be provided externally to the big distributors) and the purchasing rules for each platform. So it's best to assume that it won't be free, or that if it is free you'll be playing a transient version different from the production game. That doesn't mean we won't make it cheaper for testers (we'd like to) -- we just have no idea!]  Original comment:  Unfortunately, Google has a policy that if a game is ever set to free, it can never be set back to paid. So we will have to charge for entry to the beta, but it will be as low as we can set it, so you'll be getting a massive discount. Because when the game actually goes public, you'll still own it!  That is if we use Google Play for the beta. If we distribute it ourselves, then it can be free. We're still figuring out the details, though!"

AndroidGaming,3aj3yg,shaker28,22,Sat Jun 20 18:13:25 2015 UTC,"I just found this game climbing up the ""new paid games"" section. It's a choose your own adventure type story, but the game plays out over several *real-world days.  The story is that you're contacted by the lone survivor of a spaceship that crash landed on an unknown moon. You're the only person the survivor (named Taylor) can contact, so it's up to you to help guide him.  The interesting part is that sometimes Taylor will need time to perform a task, say investigating a wreckage or moving from one area to another. These tasks take real world time and Taylor will contact you when he's done, adding a sense of realism to the story.  I realize this will probably not appeal to a lot of folks in this sub, especially with a $3 pricetag, but it's worth checking out for any interactive fiction fans.  *edited clarification"
AndroidGaming,3aj3yg,Imasgrohn,29,Sat Jun 20 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"I started playing it yesterday.   The writing most of the time is pretty... okay. Borderline good. I was expecting it to be way more serious. The dialogue is just filled with sarcasm. I legitimately cared about the character. I don't mind that he/she (couldn't figure Taylor's gender) likes to be an asshole. Taylor died today and... I was really upset. (→ SPOILERS →) I mean, look at this. Fuck man. The game is not all about important choices that will probably kill the main character. Sometimes Taylor just wants to talk. Or wants you to find some info online. Pretty cool. Losing/winning the game unlocks two things - rewind (self explanatory, you can go back and fix everything you fucked up) and fast mode (you don't have to wait to do things). Neat.    8/10 made me feel horrible because I let Taylor die."

AndroidGaming,3aj3yg,Gerdle55,6,Sat Jun 20 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"Definitely recommend this game. The most interesting part (gimmick?) of this choose-your-own-adventure game is that some of the choices you make for Taylor (the person you are in contact with) have reasonably real wait times (ex. Taylor is tired and you tell him to rest, you wait a few hours). This gimmick, in my opinion, gives you a sense of immersion/reality? (for lack of better words).   The notifications, if set to separate, can spam up your phone and maybe make it crash, so I recommend to set that option to clustered notifications.   Similar to the reviews found on the Play Store, it made me have legitimate feelings for a fictional character."

AndroidGaming,3aj3yg,teto_medina,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:14:23 2015 UTC,"I believe someone else has already chimed in on the replay value.  After completing your first play through, you unlock a fast-forward mode that really removes the immersion that the waiting mechanism provides. Sure, it's something you get excited about, but it turns every single story branch into a chore rather than a cautious decision you're making upon someone else's life.  I explored maybe one or two different story paths before I decided I'd had enough."

Zombies, Run! must also have been on my phone for ages, I'm fuzzy on the timing, but I know I never went through the hassle of uninstalling and reinstalling.

Do be aware that the battery is flakky. Mine went from working properly to dies whenever it feels like inside of a few months. Got it replaced via warranty (their phone staff is useless. In store folks actually are very helpful if you live near one) Only for the second one to have the same problem. Granted I use heavily but not even getting a year of good use is... not optimum."

AndroidGaming,3al478,G-Solutions,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:11:18 2015 UTC,Correct me if I'm wrong but most games are vector based art and therefore scale infinitely without loss. Thus it should automatically be 4k in many ways.
AndroidGaming,3al478,MyNemIsJeff,6,Sun Jun 21 07:23:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry, but I hate to be the one saying this, but you're incorrect. As a graphic designer I know when it is appropriate and when it is not appropriate. Vectors are very simple and can be infinitely scaled, however it is not suitable for use on games. Why do I say this? Well with vector art you are limited to the design style,  you can only use simple geometric shapes and art style in which you don't get much out of.  You cannot be precise with vector images, you can't paint how you want and you can't create your graphics how you would normally do because you're limited to the amount of tools. Basic shapes and such are easy using Vector art but it's just a pain to add small important details, you can paint things much faster and conveniently with a rasterized graphic style. You have more tools and options.  Vectors are mainly used for iconography, ux/ui design and what not, it is not suitable for game graphics. Scaling isn't an issue because most designers build game graphics at very high resolution. Like take me for example, my upcoming game will have full 4K graphics to ensure it will look good on later devices."

AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,k2trf,2,Sat Jun 20 04:24:14 2015 UTC,"For one, his comment was regarding directly ripped assets, which will always be illegal.   Parody requires commentary on the subject. It is generally used for media works, as that is where the commentary is easily delivered. Creating a competing product under a thinly veiled pseudonym is not parody, it's IP infringement. Trademark and copyright law directly prevents people having products that are near enough to create consumer confusion, which is what you're describing.   If you created a game, using your own assets, that was only similar rather than a copy, that specifically made references to the fallacies of the Fallout universe and the game's mechanics, you may be protected by right to parody. It would still be a fight, as the example cases on that wiki page you linked show. Ripping the game and giving it another name however, or creating your own assets very close to the original but with a new name and slightly different design, is IP infringement and you'll be taken down swiftly.   In both cases, you're going to lose anyway, because Bethesda is not your standard android dev, they have a legal team. If a cease and desist letter doesn't scare them off, a legal battle well above any profit you would manage will. The reason most of the clones on the market last is because the real devs either don't realise or care it exists, or can't afford or understand the legal process to prevent it."

AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,cooldito,0,Sat Jun 20 05:31:06 2015 UTC,... 15% (also read as 15/100) is not a majority. Its not even one quarter...
AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,k2trf,0,Sat Jun 20 08:34:30 2015 UTC,"He didn't say it was. Reread his post. *edit: So glad someone who's illiterate is downvoting me and piyushr21. Let me spell it out for you dumb people: Apple has 15% market share but higher revenue on their marketplace, despite Android having 80%. So that's a not only higher total profits, but much higher per customer."
AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,k2trf,2,Sat Jun 20 08:44:56 2015 UTC,"It generates the same revenue, although it is often skewed since the quantity of Android devices sharing in that generated revenue is larger. This is often because outside of the US and EU, Google Wallet, PayPal, and other major financial companies won't allow people to use their services (for various reasons, mostly lawyers covering their asses).  So it isn't that people don't WANT to spend money on things they like on Google Play, but rather that a large portion of the large market share that is Android is restricted from doing so.  EDIT: This is actually because Google Play as a marketplace doesn't play nice with the financial institutions in smaller countries. Then again, neither does Apple, they just have people willing to spend massively more than the average Android user."
AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,k2trf,2,Sat Jun 20 13:52:56 2015 UTC,"But still 75% marketshare generating less revenue than 15% marketshare   As I said:   This is often because outside of the US and EU, Google Wallet, PayPal, and other major financial companies won't allow people to use their services (for various reasons, mostly lawyers covering their asses).   Moving on:   its less headache for developer to make iOS port due to fewer devices than Android because their many factors that come to play like screen size , Cpu architecture , ram , Different OS skins , screen resolution and much more.   I love seeing this constantly; Apple people love to think this is the case when they couldn't be more wrong. A developer designs to the API level they design to (the version of Andriod). Whether or not it works on individual devices is the end-users' problem.  Same thing in the world of PC Gaming; devs build to the OSs & versions they build to, and end users worry about if they meet system requirements or not."
AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,LaughterHouseV,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"So whose fault is that   Mostly the countries in question; Google and PayPal are simply unwilling to do business there due to more loose constraints and securities both for them and their users.   I have heard Apple has no problem about this.   You've heard wrong; Apple has just as much a problem as Google and PayPal, for the same reasons. On top of this, the US is the only big-economy country to have any popularity with iPhones. When they were first released, they were locked to CDMA-network providers. Only in the US is CDMA used; the rest of the world uses GSM. These days iPhones don't have to be locked, nor do they have to remain locked even if purchased that way, but the fact remains that their small marketshare is a direct result of being unfriendly to users' freedom of choice early on; the revenue developers can make from iOS is only bigger in comparison because the pool is smaller. Instead of (for example) 3% (15/500) of users purchasing crap with IAPs, there is more like 15% (15/100), not because iOS users are more willing, but because there's simply a smaller pool of users overall.   Last but not least if developer did support fewer devices , it will get very bad reputation because on iOS it supports very lower end devices too, they can't take the risk of releasing to fewer devices and have comments filled with negative reviews and get 1 stat rating this gives them bad perception and people will say its shitty port of iOS.   Did you hear about Fallout Shelter's release? That POS works on exactly 4 versions of iOS, starting with the newest. Developers don't care about releasing to an API level, because half of the reason they get more money is that Apple gives them a better price point for designing to only work on newer iOS versions (that way people don't have a choice but to upgrade past a couple of years)."
AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,k2trf,-1,Sat Jun 20 14:26:25 2015 UTC,Lol wut? PC game developers constantly check out different hardware to make sure it works. It's part of the reason why so many develop for consoles first. It's analogous to Android vs Apple development too.
AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,vvrex,2,Sat Jun 20 14:46:57 2015 UTC,"Um.... no. They choose the engine(s) they build the game with based on what prerequisites it works with, and then use those prerequisites to determine what minimum and recommended system requirements are.  Developers don't just have tons of different setups of varying quality for testing -- not even big publishers would bother doing that.  The only reason things come to console first is because they're timed exclusives (unless they just never come to PC, which is indicative of a console exclusive, with little to no demand on PC)."

AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,mboarder,3,Sat Jun 20 20:13:57 2015 UTC,"I played it on the Ipad a bit so let me elaborate: It basically is a freemium game without the freemium aspect. Meaning that iaps are not needed to enjoy it (no paywall) and that you can play it as long as you want in one sitting (no energy bars or other shit). This makes it very enjoyable for the casual aspect and simplicity it delivers. UI interaction and animations are very far from anything an amateur developer could come up with.  Therefor I don't really understand your need to repeat the phrase ""consumer guine pig"", but whatever floats your boat to make you feel superior.  The Bethesda part: They make great games and only published this little game (who would have guessed it is not an AAA for handhelds amirite?!) to promote Fallout 4, which already is a game that really will sell itself. So it is a nice Addition they put on top.  TL;DR: not spending a dime on an enjoyable minigame does make you a consumerist guinnea pig why exactly?"
AndroidGaming,3ag9z9,Minimalphilia,-1,Sat Jun 20 05:44:10 2015 UTC,"yeah thats nice and all but still not explained WHY the game is worth playing?

It appeals to the basic reward systems in our brains which is the motivator in every single pc game we ever played. Practise, get better, grow and repeat.

AndroidGaming,3aet4m,grawrz,5,Fri Jun 19 15:23:17 2015 UTC,"Both H&C games look impressive, but the screenshots gave me the impression of a large game world ripe for exploration. The first game was a bit of a let down in that regard (for me, anyway), since it's entirely base defense in enclosed levels against fixed waves of enemies. I don't consider it poorly designed, or even unenjoyable, but I felt that the visual presentation implied a less compartmentalized game world and more varied gameplay.  Is H&C2 still purely ""defend against incoming waves of increasingly stronger enemies,"" or does it have a little more meat on its bones?"
AndroidGaming,3aet4m,PSBlake,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"it's primarily castle defence... that's the core element around which they've implemented other elements.  you level your character and select/train/upgrade skills and equipment like an RPG.  and you build/upgrade defenses and train/upgrade units like rts.  the first one is one of my favorites on this platform.  very well balanced blend of genres.  iaps weren't necessary for accessing content, they're intended as shortcuts...   I'm only a level or two into this sequel, so I can't comment on that, but so far, it feels like a proper sequel, not just a reskin of the first game.  it's not an open world, but the maps do seem quite a bit deeper and more varied than in the previous game."
AndroidGaming,3aet4m,unerds,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:34:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I saw a gameplay video of it yesterday and it looked like a 3d castle defense game. Like literally a castle defense game where all you do is attack waves of enemies and summon units and defend your base. Still looks kind of fun but seems like it might get repetitive.
AndroidGaming,3aet4m,phoenixblue,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:22:30 2015 UTC,"I hear you. I have the same complaint with the first game. This time there are other areas,  not just the starting castle (and the beach front castle after it). In between missions,  you have an option to travel to other lands to capture them (basically,  you raid them) to capture resources and unlock units that you can summon.   This game is a hell of a lot more demanding Btw. I had to turn down everything just to get a decent framerate."
AndroidGaming,3aet4m,PSBlake,6,Fri Jun 19 20:36:08 2015 UTC,"It shows army on army battles, and mentions conquering lands, but there isn't any clear indication of whether it's a large, open world, or just ""level one is this castle, level two is this other castle, etc.""  How interconnected are the environments down in the video?"
AndroidGaming,3aet4m,Thomas-C,6,Fri Jun 19 15:49:46 2015 UTC,"There's a map where you choose where you want to go. Each location has a map which is fairly large, but exploration isn't the emphasis.  You don't have set levels to go between, rather each location has a battle to be fought and it will need to be defended periodically after you take it, the goal being presumably to conquer every map location.    There's your castle, wilderness locations, towns, small outposts, enemy castles and outposts upon which you lay siege, maybe one or two others.  But to get back to the point, they're interconnected through a map screen - you do not travel between them and explore territory."

AndroidGaming,3aet4m,unerds,2,Fri Jun 19 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"insta buy for me.  the first one is excellent... sunk many hours into it, beat the first castle, played well into the second... unlocked all the characters without IAP.  played this one for a few minutes and it definitely feels like a proper sequel.  iirc, I had suggested that the castle have multiple entry points, and they made that happen!  love it when devs have actual meaningful interactions with their communities.  I know people hate the IAP thing, but in the last one, iaps were 100% optional not detracting from gameplay in any way.  they're more like shortcuts to content that you'd unlock naturally as you progress.  in the first game, it really wasn't any sort of grind... the sequence of rewards and unlocks was well balanced for just casually playing through."
AndroidGaming,3aet4m,ceanji,2,Sat Jun 20 00:35:41 2015 UTC,"This is a bit late, so I'm not sure if anyone will see this, but I've played a few hours of the game already. Here is my review:   The game, at it's core, is very much like the original. Your hero is stronger than the units you can summon, but not terribly powerful that you can solo the content unless sufficiently leveled. This game adds a layer of difficulty over the original, in that you can lose some units if they are unlocked by owning a territory. The Priest is the most notable because that unit is very important and the only healer for the early part of the game. Races can now ""multiclass."" Warriors and Paladins in the first game were both humans but they are separate classes. In this game, you can be a Warrior AND a Paladin at the same time, given enough levels. I love the sword swipe attack of the Warrior, and I love the Healing Aura by the Paladin.  I can have both for my Human Hero now! :D This game is still hard as nails. I have to redo several missions to gather up enough crystals to upgrade my units. The game does provide you with mercenaries when you fail so you have a better chance of winning the waves.  This game supports my IPEGA-9025 Mode Y out of the box. It actually surprised me how well this game plays with a controller. I hope FM can implement this system into H&C1 and Bug Heroes 2 too :D This game is VERY resource intensive. I had to set everything to low just to get a decent framerate, but it still skips a few frames when I max out my unit count. I have a THL 5000, (2gb ram 1.7GHz octacore); older devices should steer clear.   I would love to see FM iron out a few more things like the ground constantly redrawing  when I enter a level but overall, I am very happy with my purchase."

To explain in more detail, there are four pins in a usb connection, two power, and two data. The wireless Xbox one controller is the same as the wireless Xbox 360 controller and although the cable has usb on one end, it is only for charging, not transmitting data.  Edit: This appears to be incorrect. While the above is true for the 360 controller, it isn't so for the XO controller. You can use any standard MicroUSB and plug it into a PC to use it. The caveat here is that you must be using the Windows Drivers from the Xbox Support site. If someone were able to reverse engineer these drivers and build support into an android app or ROM, then perhaps it will work OTG. Until then, using a XO controller on android remains a no-go."

AndroidGaming,3adqnr,theBloodedge,12,Fri Jun 19 08:37:09 2015 UTC,"They basically use 2 engines and stay with that engine but change a core feature here or there as well as the story to give it a fresh feel. I personally enjoy them because they give me that mid 90's feel of rpgs when the super nes and genesis would fight for supremacy.  That pre-polygon era feel for the most of their games. That's Kemco's stong suit. They have been around since 1986 so they got their formula packed as far as churning stuff out. They just use around the same 2-3 engines and swap out the play styles and writing. The plots are usually the same jrpg stuff, save the princess,town, country, kingdom or avenge blah blah. Some have time travel and some of mechs or a pokemon style collect thing going on.  That being said the stories can be long winded sometimes as in someone needs to tell them the meaning of succinct when it comes to their writing. That being said I can tell you the ones that I enjoyed the most out of this which usually give me a Phantasy Star vibe or somethings around a late 80's to late 90's feel.  Chrome Wolf, Rusted Emeth, Fanatic Earth, Fortuna Magus, and Bonds of the Sky.  Shelterra is pretty good and Aeon Avenger is meh.   I have heard some not so nice things about Dead Dragons but I am picking up Revenant Saga, Grace of Letoile, and Eclipse of illusion I have the rest for the most part and Seven Sacred beast is a collect and battle with monsters type deal with the evolution a la pokemon so I am steering away from that. Those games usually demand your attention so I stay away from those.  If you want details of the ones I played already pick one and I can give you more detail.  EDIT: For grammer"

AndroidGaming,3adqnr,theBloodedge,5,Fri Jun 19 09:52:59 2015 UTC,"Good question. I'm going to say this. They aren't that grindy. The grinding part doesn't ruin it because a lot of the way they do their combat systems. You'll want to grind in order to figure things out.  They don't ease you into things to much. They kinda just yell at you to this that and the other then give you keys and send you off without a 100% full lesson.  When they do it's like a text based cut scene. That would be the most annoying thing with their games. it isn't the grinding but their  want to do a cut scene but with sprites that don't move.  By that they would sit them at a table and give you 3-5 paragraphs of dialogue. THAT is where you get the grinding from. The damn dialogue. If you want to get an idea without paying try Fortuna Magus (there is a trial version), Band of Monsters, End of Aspiration, or Crystareino. You'll get an idea of what I mean.

AndroidGaming,3adqnr,scotttech1,7,Fri Jun 19 09:18:20 2015 UTC,That would be impossible to say the best. Seriously. It would be the equivalent of what Square Enix game is the best. These games tend to blend in different genre and jrpg eras. Like if you were looking for something more 80's in the tune of Phantasy Star Sega Master System type and maybe with some mech that would be an easier way to go.  I.E.

Second Edit: I tested all the kemco games that I have and all of them except Destiny fantasia DOES NOT need to be connected to either mobile or wi-fi to start. All of them started in airplane mode without a problem. I didn't get Dead Dragons or Eclipse of Illusion so I didn't test them.But I pretty much have all of them in this sale EXCEPT those two.

AndroidGaming,3adpo8,Ragey_McRagerton,9,Fri Jun 19 12:23:43 2015 UTC,"Toddler Lock is a drawing app that's pretty useful when they're young. It actually locks your phone (you have to press each corner clockwise to unlock it) so they can't do damage, and they can draw, or tap the screen for random shape stamps & a little bell ding. Really useful for when they're starting to get rowdy in a waiting room or something. Eventually they get bored as they grow up though.   Toddler Fun is good too, especially for that next age group of maybe 2-3. It has 4 modes, drawing, shooting fireworks, stars & connecting dots. The connecting dots is great when they're starting to get fine motor skills & logic developing. They can get out of it though, so beware the random text messages to your contacts."

And two, they start fine, but by the second area there's rubbish ""challenge levels"" every few designed to drain your lives, and they get worse and worse. They get next to impossible without the purchases, or easy with them. I gave up on it, despite loving peggle & enjoying the other levels, because I refused to support that kind of bullshit.   Unobtrusive is something like Middle Manager of Justice, which has a coin doubler and a bonus doubler, neither of which you will ever realise exist unless you go looking. You certainly don't feel like the game is designed to be played with them, and damaged by playing for free."

AndroidGaming,3adfpg,n0tj0sh33,1 point,Fri Jun 19 09:38:15 2015 UTC,"Depends. I play Multiplayer on Asphalt 8 a lot. I drive the Dodge. You know, the one that comes free when you start the game. It's pretty easy to upgrade it by doing a few single player races, and I come top 3 9 times out of 10 on multiplayer.   The racing is good. Sometimes I win easily. Sometimes I get wiped out. But mostly I have a good challenging race that's a lot of fun.   I get where you're coming from. It's pretty annoying when a Renault Dezir comes out of nowhere because there's no way my Dodge can match it's straight line speed. But on most courses, most of the time, I love my Dodge. I've never spent any money on the game and I feel no need to start now.   Besides, I've almost accumulated enough in game credits to buy the Dezir!"

Then another 'more powerful in every way' car is added, rendering your current best car useless. It costs a bomb so you can't buy it immediately. But cheaters and rich people can. So multi-player sucks once again. But wait, there's more! A newly added totally-awesome track can only be accessed if you have a maxed out version of the new car! Rinse and repeat.   That has been my experience with the Asphalt 8. I stopped playing a while ago."

I keep thinking about buying a Moga Hero Power controller, but then I'm just not willing to spend the money on a controller for my phone.  I wonder if the gaming problems are on iOS?  I recall playing more games when I had an iPhone, and while those titles are available on Android, the problems were seemingly added in.  Do you think it's all because of people stealing games?"
AndroidGaming,3abs8n,InternetArtisan,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:10:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what the problem is, I've never owned an iPhone but I'd say that because literally anyone can become an android developer and upload an app on the Play Store (unlike iOS that has strict rules) it makes the play store and by extension android a not that good platform for serious projects.  And I don't really blame android or google, they wanted an open ecosystem that anyone can join, and I love android for that reason! The problem is that a lot of malicious people take advantage of that and make apps only to earn money not caring if they are degrading android's appearance in a bad way, while on iPhone people must go to great extends to become developers not to mention a yearly pay, which makes it less likely for someone to ""throw away"" fake accounts to spam apps, that cannot make it to the app store anyway because of apple's strict rules.  A perfect ecosystem (in my opinion) would be one exactly like android, but only filled with people that cared about it and released apps that made it better and better (like linux! ) but this seems high unlikely. If you ban people for uploading money hungry games you don't have an open ecosystem.  One last point is that anyone in android can review an app and give it any stars they want. I've seen reviews stating ""it's perfect ! 1/5 stars"" and things like ""I didn't like it 5/5"", this makes it very hard for actually good apps to be discovered. Casual people care mostly about the appearance of an app. A beautiful app must mean it's working better, right?  This makes developers focus on appearance rather than an app that actually works, it's bug-free and battery lightweight. I can't blame developers, they are after numbers, and I can't really blame casual people (in terms of technology) because I'm a casual on other aspects - like cars - and I could be making similar mistakes."

Copy paste piece of text now explaining the game: This War Of Mine provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. For the very first time you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout. At night you get a chance to scavenge nearby locations for items that will help you stay alive.  Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them to endure the hardships. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better."

AndroidGaming,3a556h,Fellhuhn,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:16:03 2015 UTC,"The game has two parts:  During the day you control all your survivors but can't leave your house. You manage their time (realtime) by assigning tasks. At start you secure and cleanup the house and later on you can craft stuff. You also control who sleeps, eats etc. There might be some events during a day with additional choices.  At night you can select one survivor to go on a scavenge hunt. First you select the target which ranges from ""poor old grandma's house"" to ""reinforced military outpost"". Those houses then can be looted. Your inventory is limited as is your time. Dying comes easy.   Besides death from various angles you have to defend against the insanity that is called war. Will you rob the old poor people to ease your own suffering? Will you risk the sanity of your people in doing so?"

It was 2.50USD on Steam last night (sale price), when its normally 3USD on Android, and normally 25USD on Steam.  I'd best describe it as an RTS Warfare Management game, but that's also inherently incorrect; turns are done whenever you want (games can last minutes or days), but when both people submit their turn, the server will play them both at the same time, and show both people the outcome, and then await submissions of the next turn.  It isn't free, on either platform, but there's no IAP mechanics, P2W or otherwise. The Android client is (as far as I know) the exact same as the Steam client, with the exception of some animations in the backgrounds, and the screen size."

You can buy 'gold' ammo, even for in-game currency that you can grind, but it sucks at long distances compared to stock ammo, and better team tactics will trump that advantage any time of the day.

AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,ashkpa,24,Tue Jun 16 21:41:04 2015 UTC,"It's not that difficult to develop for Android.  Maybe it's just absolutely insanely easy to develop for iOS? (rolls eyes) I'm obliged to give the benefit of the doubt, because the last time I've ever been on the Mac landscape was 15+ years ago (and as a user), but I very much doubt that B started developing FS on both platforms at the same time (or even more or less the same time) and they were able to focus on the iOS version and have it out by E3, but the Android version just cannot be done yet because of how much easier one environment is compared to the other.  TL;DR: Even if there is a strong difference in development difficulty, the time period of ""hopefully a few months"" represents a difference in scale of colossal proportions. I see no other explanation other than a contractual obligation."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,speaks_in_subreddits,6,Tue Jun 16 21:50:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's way easier to make an app on iPhone for just about every reason except their vetting process. Without going into tons of detail, one huge reason is that Android apps need to support thousands of different devices, with different screen sizes and various other specific quirks. Additionally it's a fair amount easier to build an app in Objective-C with Xcode than it is to build one in Java.  Most likely they started developing for the iPhone with plans to begin the Android port post release. The main reason devs do this is that iPhone is significantly more profitable for developers. To be fair I doubt the ease or difficulty of developing on either was a huge factor here. More likely it was a financial decision, and quite frankly the correct one from a financial perspective."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,Smooth_McDouglette,16,Tue Jun 16 22:14:14 2015 UTC,"If they had written the game in a cross platform friendly engine/framework like Unity I'm willing to bet they could have the Android version out in weeks instead of months. For native development the gap has closed between iOS and Android now that Android Studio is out as well. The argument for choosing iOS over Android for development reasons is pretty outdated now. For business/support reasons one could still argue that it's better to just focus on iOS to start (iOS users spend more money, smaller user base to handle customer support and server load). Mobile game devs really can't ignore Android any longer however as the Android user base is so much larger and therefore more potential money to be made."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,starboard,-2,Tue Jun 16 22:24:29 2015 UTC,"Android's user base is only much larger on a global scale.

Both platforms use OpenGL and similar Object-Oriented languages, and while Android is a little more fiddly I don't see different screen sizes being that much of a problem. I made quite a simple game on Android so I might be biased, but scaling was a mostly trivial problem to solve.  Also I would agree about the financial perspective with many other apps but I think this is just as much about marketing the brand as it is straight app profits, and Android has a much larger user base."

It just seems absolutely retarded to close out half of your userbase, probably more since I'd imagine most people interested in Fallout 4 trend on the Android side of the fence but that's just me guessing and means nothing, for literally no real reason.   Source on those numbers: https://gigaom.com/2015/02/04/android-and-ios-are-nearly-tied-for-u-s-smartphone-market-share/"
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,Colby347,-23,Tue Jun 16 23:27:14 2015 UTC,"I'd have to disagree that most people interested in fallout 4 would be on iOS. I believe they would be almost even. Even with that, you can't deny that the Apple app store is more popular for games. Android's game market is close to dead due to piracy (despite the facts most piraters won't pay for a game if it was their only option) and iApp fraud. Also, Bethesda isn't ""closing out"" half of their market. They are still releasing it. I would rather wait a few months for a good game instead of the shitty ports Square Enix has shit out."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,braden26,5,Wed Jun 17 00:14:47 2015 UTC,Android's game market is close to dead due to piracy.   Spoken like a true Apple fanboy
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,bagboyrebel,-7,Wed Jun 17 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"I have an android device. Have you looked on the play store lately? The top page is all Candy Crush and Clash of Clans clones. The only good games are pixel dungeon banner saga and a few others. I don't care for Apple, but they have a much larger selection of games."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,braden26,-39,Wed Jun 17 13:36:37 2015 UTC,"I'm an android user and I'm not upset with this. Why should iOS users be limited by us? You are getting the game. Bethesda didn't even have to release this. Fallout 4 isn't enough, you have to get this game now? Just be patient and stop acting like a spoiled brat."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,braden26,24,Wed Jun 17 14:08:53 2015 UTC,"billion dollar companies can release android and ios together, its not about holding back ios."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,yaba3800,-33,Tue Jun 16 22:56:11 2015 UTC,"You are acting as though you are entitled to this game. You're not. I would rather have that billion dollar company putting it's resources to its game and not an android game. I'm not that informed on cross platform development, so I am not the most qualified for saying that. But this entire comment section has been Bethesda should have done android sooner. This game didn't have to exist. Why try to ruin someone else's fun because you can't get it sooner? Even if it was a times exclusive and Android would have had to wait any way, you are getting this game and Fallout 4. None of us are entitled to receive any of those. Just stop complaining that Bethesda is ignoring android when they have stated there will be an android release."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,braden26,14,Tue Jun 16 23:18:50 2015 UTC,"The thing is is that Bethesda is not some kind of charity. They're not making games out of the ""goodness of their hearts,"" they're making games because that's how they became a multi billion dollar company. So while we aren't entitled to games, we are also the ones who will (or after this maybe won't) be paying Bethesda, so we are definitely in a position to be allowed to demand fair treatment."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,wyratt14,-6,Tue Jun 16 23:24:10 2015 UTC,"Then why not treat valve the same way? People have been saying Half Life 3 for years, but no half life 3. Bethesda delivered with Fallout 4. And instead of being happy about that, you guys are complaining about a shitty iOS app that most of the iOS users say isn't that good."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,braden26,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:59:55 2015 UTC,"Right, billion dollar company but if they work on an Android game they won't have manpower for Fallout 4. It's literally just Todd and 5 other guys scrambling to finish."

I don't care about it now, and won't care about it when I can get it."

AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,yaba3800,23,Tue Jun 16 18:34:11 2015 UTC,Why does it take a couple months to port an app?
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,Chairman_Yeng,22,Tue Jun 16 23:18:03 2015 UTC,Especially when development platforms exist that work for both operating systems.
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,TeutorixAleria,10,Tue Jun 16 19:40:09 2015 UTC,"They suck, it takes as much work to accomodate both platforms in a way that doesn't end up looking good."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,basilect,9,Tue Jun 16 20:10:34 2015 UTC,Still not an excuse for leaving half your audience behind.   The whole purpose is to build hype but by the time the android version is done we will be playing the actual fallout game.
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,TeutorixAleria,-3,Tue Jun 16 21:26:05 2015 UTC,"Not to be disparaging here but do you think Bethesda cares? People are hyped for Fallout 4 with or without this mobile game. Budget wise I'd be surprised if Fallout Shelter had even 1/1000th the money thrown at it as Fallout 4. Why should they prioritize it?  I have an android phone myself and I'm pretty irked that I can't play this game now, but I totally understand it from a business perspective."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,Smooth_McDouglette,2,Tue Jun 16 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"Wtf are you talking about? Unity has been used to have games on PlayStation, Xbox, Android and iOS."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,libertyfrog,18,Tue Jun 16 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"It doesn't, the app is likely ready or close to ready.  There's a hidden timed exclusivity deal going with Apple or with one of their partners."
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,steak4take,3,Tue Jun 16 22:24:21 2015 UTC,Is this speculation?
AndroidGaming,3a2fqt,pickle182,13,Tue Jun 16 22:57:30 2015 UTC,"It's totally speculation, but it seems pretty likely. The weird way they were praising Apple during its presentation pretty much screams ""paid for""."

When you finish the quest, and get the item, force close the app. Come back, you'll have the item, but you can turn the quest back in to get it again. I did this with The One Ring, cut down on the grind. In retrospect, probably made the game too easy."

AndroidGaming,3a1coh,dubplate,6,Tue Jun 16 13:38:03 2015 UTC,"The only supported devices are S6 and S6 Edge, yet all their pictures and videos show it being used with the Xperia Z3...Hopefully they add it as a supported device before its release, this sounds amazing."
AndroidGaming,3a1coh,Alebot,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:19:35 2015 UTC,"We started our prototype with Z3, at the time was the best option to go for, but as it's not going to be a recent model by the time we release Flitchio we decided to start with supporting flagship models first. However you can vote for your favourite phone here https://flitch.io/phonevote"
AndroidGaming,3a1coh,Flitchio,1 point,Wed Jun 17 10:44:44 2015 UTC,"Already voted _, but by the time this comes out the S6 will be almost a year old...well hopefully more flagships are added before it releases, if not I guess I'll be waiting a while."
AndroidGaming,3a1coh,Alebot,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:35:06 2015 UTC,"Would you actually pay $60-$100US for an Android controller? When there are solid, proven alternatives for as little as 15?  This thing looks neat at best I can't see it selling more than a handful of units at such a high price. $100 for a controller is beyond ridiculous."
AndroidGaming,3a1coh,xenthum,2,Wed Jun 17 02:30:50 2015 UTC,It really depends on how good it is. I would honestly prefer a slide out controller case like the one that's available for iPhones but this would be great too if they'd just open it up to more devices. I have a Nexus 6 and would pay a lot for a slide out controller and would be willing to lay $60 for this if depending on how well it works. The idea is to just not have to carry around controllers everywhere you go.
AndroidGaming,3a1coh,shangrila500,1 point,Wed Jun 17 07:44:38 2015 UTC,"The main idea is to have an all-in-one solution, while Flitchio is a controller, it works as a protective case too. we've put a lot of work into design and functionality to make sure it is a high quality product. The cost mainly relates to the technologies used and the tooling."
AndroidGaming,3a1coh,Flitchio,2,Wed Jun 17 10:47:22 2015 UTC,Will you be releasing it for other devices? I have a Nexus 6 and am very very interested in getting one but as of now there is only a case for the S6 devices.

I know that that's the whole point of your original pitch, but this way at least more people would be able to pledge.   Sort of like how dimple.io does it."
AndroidGaming,3a1coh,YukarinVal,1 point,Fri Jun 19 07:17:33 2015 UTC,That is one of the original ideas that we had as well. The main problem with something like that is that it is not solid and most importantly not accurate enough for a gamer. Our primary goal was to have the controller be as accurate and responsive as possible.

I'm from Germany and I bought Wolfenstein: The New Order German Edition last year on Steam.  Here is a report from schnittberichte.com (google translate link), if you want to know more.      It was banned in Germany       That is wrong. Wolfenstein: The New Order has been censored, not banned.  Censorship is inacceptable and I want to change this practice in my country, which is a slow process.      because they don't have freedom of expression there.      Also wrong.  Here is the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany in english.      Article 5  Freedom of expression, arts and sciences  (1) Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech, writing and pictures, and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed. There shall be no censorship.

AndroidGaming,39xy23,TheMrPooper,5,Mon Jun 15 18:26:07 2015 UTC,Has anyone played these games? I've played Type:Rider which I thought was interesting and fun although got a bit repetitive. And Lone Wolf is very popular although it wasn't really my thing. I think I got both of those in previous bundles.  But some of these other games have pretty brutal reviews on the play store.
AndroidGaming,39xy23,blueclawsoftware,3,Mon Jun 15 18:58:51 2015 UTC,Lone wolf is a pretty great game.
AndroidGaming,39xy23,AshTheGoblin,4,Mon Jun 15 21:34:35 2015 UTC,"I just bought the bundle and I'm working my way through them now...  I'll update as I go.  Dark Lands: A fun runner with a bit more depth.  The controls could use liiitle work, but apart from that, the concept is good.  You can try it for free here too. Maltdown: Played the free version before - decent arcade/action shooter. Pretentious Game: Not a great game. Super short (~5 minutes). Totally unoptimised (it's a direct AiR port of the flash game, lags slightly on Nexus 7). Concept is good. Game is poor. Would recommend This Level Again over it if you're looking for something in a similar vein."
AndroidGaming,39xy23,The_Mighty_Tspoon,2,Tue Jun 16 09:23:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, three stars leaves me a bit suspicious as well.   I got iPollute from a past bundle, but I don't understand it enough to review it. It's a claymation game where you do things to the environment (create land fills, cut down trees,) and all of the actions have an effect on the environment. The goal is to create as much as you can without destroying the environment. Instruction is pretty much absent from what I can't tell so you'll have to mess around with the different command buttons to figure out what does what.  Edit: stars"
AndroidGaming,39xy23,Tomato_Farmer73,3,Mon Jun 15 19:31:11 2015 UTC,That's disappointing to hear iPollute is one of the games that intrigued me. I love the art style but it was hard to tell from the video and description how it was a game.
AndroidGaming,39xy23,blueclawsoftware,3,Tue Jun 16 00:32:51 2015 UTC,It depends on the order of how you interact with the environment. too much attention one place gives attention some other place. But taking unexplored options give a higher overall completion percentage.
AndroidGaming,39xy23,ceanji,2,Tue Jun 16 13:24:13 2015 UTC,"I've played the free version of Meltdown because it works well with my Moga controller, was fun, and challenging. However, it was such a grinding game that I came to the point of pay or quit. I quit. If I remember right I couldn't justify paying  because it seemed like you'd eventually have to pay more later. If the premium version fixes this count me in. Anyone know?"
AndroidGaming,39xy23,Biblelicious,2,Mon Jun 15 19:40:21 2015 UTC,It's around $4. Yes it is.  I have heard not too good things about Colto Maltese &  how some of the clues are lost in translation.  Twin Blades is meh. But Lone Wolf and the rest carries it home.
AndroidGaming,39xy23,ceanji,6,Mon Jun 15 19:53:17 2015 UTC,"Lots of repeats on this one,  but holy crap Lone Wolf is in it again! It's worth it for that alone. I've raved about it before in this sub.   I've played and bought Meltdown twice (on pc and on Android). It's a really fun cover shooter that is cross platform (Android, iOS, and Steam). It becomes a bit grindy at the end but I've never paid anything else past the initial cost to unlock the whole game. It plays well with a moga controller too. Not so much with my ipega though. It plays just fine on touch screen.   I'll definitely buy this bundle.   EDIT: Bought the bundle. Here's what I've tried so far:   Type: Rider - it's an educational platformer where you traverse landscapes composed of letters and characters. It has information about the history of letters and writing. It's a bit easy as a platformer but it's a nice way to learn about stuff gamers aren't usually interested in. Meltdown - it's almost exactly like the Play Store version, except for one thing: It has no google play integration. No achievements if you play the HB version :( I already posted my thoughts on it above.  Pretentious game - If you played Thomas Was Alone, it's quite similar. The game is incredibly simple, but the story it tells is interesting.  It has a lot of surprises that gave me feels.The music absolutely makes the game. The bundle says that the OST is included, but it's nowhere to be seen on my download page. Already sent a message to HB about it. However, one thing that irks me is that this game has full screen ads :/ It's not really disruptive of the gameplay, it's just annoying that it pops up after you finish a chapter. Lone Wolf - Read my post about this game here."

You can build facilities and train and level up your vault dwellers so they can go outside and scavenge. Apparently they mentioned that there aren't any pay walls in form of wait times and such. But there are microtransactions in the form of lunch boxes that can be used to obtain items. I'm pretty sure you can obtain lunchboxes without the use of money. So it's kinda line tiny tower with a fallout twist and rob elements.

The bread system still makes it that way to some degree but the bread is easy enough to get without insane grind. I don't understand why more games don't have hero level up based on usage.

AndroidGaming,39woze,Imasgrohn,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:16:36 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I was thinking I could convert my app into a generic browser game playing app where you define the controls based on the game. For example you enter the url of the game and I would have buttons and a joystick and you could define button 1 as space bar and button 2 for x and the joystick as the keyboard or mouse depending on the game.

Especially if you are into visual novels.  I would also recommend Dragon Quest 9. It's one of the best JRPGs that the DS had.  Another good visual novels are Hotel Dusk: Room 215 and Last Window: The Secret of Cape West. Amazing art-style and interesting story.  Finally, I think Rhythm Heaven would look good on your tablet."
AndroidGaming,39x6rm,MetalGearZEKE,5,Mon Jun 15 19:48:11 2015 UTC,"Game: 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors (999)  Genre: Visual Novel  Enjoyability rating ON TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:  This is a visual novel type game so it's not that action heavy. To follow the story, read the dialog and solve puzzles with simple taps.     Game: Professor Layton Games  Genre: Puzzle  Enjoyability rating ON TOUCH: 9/10  Reasoning:  Reason behind the 9/10 score is because these games are recommended to be played with the DS Stylus. Now don't worry, this will not ruin your day. The only slight issue, if you can even call it that, is that the game sometimes will ask for the answer to be written down, and if you are using your fingers this will provide mild inconvenience with the recognition thingy but it's not a huge hurdle to overcome.     Game:Miles Edgeworth Ace Attorney Investigations 1 & 2  Genre:Puzzle/Mystery  Enjoyability rating ON TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:  This is very similar to the Phoenix Wright series. In this spin-off the characters sprites are animated and you can walk around the place. The tap enjoyability is high because once you put your fingers on the screen the only thing lifting them up will be the low battery warning sound.     Game: Hotel Dusk - Room 215  Genre: Mystery/Puzzle  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:   This game is played sideways. The idea behind it was that you'd be holding the DS like you would a book so it might be slightly confusing at the first glance.The controls are fairly simple you use the touch screen to move, touch things access menus and even to open the detectives notebook and clumsily write things down.     Game: Golden Sun: Dark Dawn  Genre: RPG/Adventure  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 8/10  Reasoning:   Now the only reason that this is an eight is the fact that not everyone has 5 inch phones. Depending on the screen size of your phone using your finger to move the main character may prove to be difficult. Now of course this shouldn't be an issues for most of you. The entire game is playable using only the touch screen and its playing perfectly. I wouldn't want to miss this one,it's an amazing rpg.     Game: Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 1 & 2  Genre: Turn Based Strategy/RPG  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 8/10  Reasoning:   Well it's a strategy game which means you won't be fingering your screen in a panicking manner, but you'll be calmly making tactical decisions while sipping tea or something. The score is lower because I can't remember if some of the game interface wasn't accessible with only using the touch screen.     Game: Advance Wars - Dual Strike  Genre: Turn Based Strategy  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:  Well it's becoming kind of a trend by now but yes, turn based strategy games work great on phones(tablets), and this one in particular maybe more than the others.     Game: Jake Hunter - Detective Chronicles  Genre: Visual Novel  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:  This is another easy choice to make if you're concerned about touch screen controls. The game is played a lot like the Ace Attorney Series.     Game: Time Hollow  Genre: Visual Novel  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:   Yes,another visual novel. This one is about time travel if the title wasn't a big enough hint.     System: Nintendo Dual Screen (NDS)  Emulator used: Drastic  I copied my comment from a thread couple of days old with a similar question, might be a good idea to start making a list in the sidebar or something. Have fun!!"

AndroidGaming,39wbnk,TheGodfeather,3,Mon Jun 15 09:53:45 2015 UTC,"The thing that really bugged me about Merchant is the economy is screwed. You make more money selling the resources you gather than you ever could by crafting things. It's a great concept, and it seems like it would only take a bit of a tweak to fix, but the devs seem to have abandoned it.  To be fair, you can pretend this isn't the case and still have some fun with it, but when I did a bit of math and realized crafting was pointless, it killed the game for me."

AndroidGaming,39tppb,Smooth_McDouglette,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:11:05 2015 UTC,"Great for turn based rpg type games. Not so great for platformers that require accuracy and more than one simultaneous button press (Donkey kong/Mario Y to run + A to jump is a problem as it's basically impossible to hit two buttons at once). Almost all platformers suck on a touch screen emu, with the notable exception of Sonic since it only has one button.  But if you're down to check out some old school rpg games, it's an ideal user interface for that. Some of my favs include Earthbound, Chrono Trigger, FF3, Pokemon, Link to the Past is really clunky but doable. Mario RPG is really good except for one part in booster's tower that is impossible on a touch screen, so you have to send the save to PC, beat the part, and send it back to the phone after."

AndroidGaming,39tppb,coppergone,3,Mon Jun 15 02:16:12 2015 UTC,"Inflation right is kinda niche. You pick a character (each one has different stats and can use different weapons etc) and fight enemies where the area you are in dictates their level. You don't actually fight, it's all automated you just decide how to split your upgrades. You have 30 battles to get as high a level as you can. Items and gems you buy (which give you start buffs) remain but you start at lvl 0 all over again.   Collosatron is a top down blow everything up game where you upgrade a huge mechasnake as you destroy cities and collect upgrade orbs that fit into its body. Different colours do different types of attack and defense and colours can be joined (red and blue make purple, eg)"

BitDungeonII is more a rpg than anything else except you never control your stats. Roam the top world to kill enemies and collect new weapons and armour and scour the Dungeons to find rare magical items and find out who killed the Princess you see at the start.

AndroidGaming,39tppb,mboarder,4,Mon Jun 15 02:14:58 2015 UTC,"So, I have a tablet, not a phone... but...  Icewind Dale Works great. Solid RPG experience.  Breach and Clear I've played it for PC, and its a solid tactical game. Would recommend.  Plague Inc. Always a good timewaster. Great game.  Grand Prix Story I've played their other games, like Game Dev Tycoon, and they're usually really good.  Slayin Sort of an odd timewaster. A little more action oriented by comparison.  Freeciv Haven't opened it yet, but its civilization 1, open source, so...  Dragonfall Solid, solid Turn-based RPG. Highly, highly recommend.  XCom Enemy Within Turn-based strategy RPG. Fantastic game. Highly, highly recommend. The management aspects are great.  Godus Have it on PC, too, and its a solid 'god game' where you don't directly control the NPCs.  Knights of Pen and Paper 2 So far, I'm not as much of a fan of KoPaP2, but mostly because my characters feel a lot weaker than before.  Terraria Solid game, but the controls suffer from some translation problems from PC. i feel like they lack a level of precision, because of how small you're able to modify the pixels, etc.  Infectonator Solid timewaster. You basically play the zombies and try to wipe everyone out on individual maps. I'd say its a puzzle game, buts its more of a strategy game.  Minecraft PE Well, its minecraft. Do I really need to say anything?  Defenders Haven't really played it much, but its a tower defense, and those are usually pretty great.  Pixel Dungeon and Soft Pixel Dungeon Good Roguelikes. I prefer Soft Pixel Dungeon because I don't like the perma-death of roguelikes, in spite of liking nearly all the other elements.  Catan Board game. Haven't played it much yet, but it should do a great job of scratching the boardgame itch.  Bard's Tale I like the dev, and its an RPG, with comedy, so its probably pretty good.  Fortress Fury You build your own fortress, in 2D, with resource limits, etc. and then try to kill the other team's fortress. Cool concept. Plays well enough.  Final Fantasy Record Keeper Play final fantasy fights? Ok then. I haven't gotten a change to open it, yet, but its probably pretty solid.  Bloods TD 5 More Tower defense. I think TD, in general, is fun, so...  Hearthstone Another one of the solid, solid games. Great CCG game. Fun to play, but requires internet access. Also not really a singleplayer style of game.  Modern Combat Its like a weird take on tower defense. Its tower defense, but with some slight difference. Good game, though.  Bardbarian Its sort of like a 3-lane tower defense, except your towers follow you around as NPC, and... yea... its different  Rebuild Solid game. Its has a sort of base building and management mechanic mixed with a little sprinkle of RPG.  Star Traders 4x Elite Pretty sure its just a space trader game, as the name implies, which are usually rather fun in their own right. Take a ship, make some money, upgrade your stuff, and repeat.  Merchant This one is weird. Its got a time-wait function, like many of the micro-transaction games we all know and generally loathe, but it doesn't, to my knowledge, have micro-transactions to speed things up. Good game, if repetitive, and after a while, rather pointless.  Star Command Solidly fun, but short. I wish there was just more to this game, and more to do. Its campaign-based, but the campaign is fairly short.  Simple Rockets Basically a 2D version of Kerbal.  Soccer Spririts Saw someone recommend this one, and haven't had a chance to try it out.  Star Realms Seemed like a space-sim game, so I grabbed it. Haven't opened it yet.  Fiz A rather great management game. Reminds me of Game Dev Tycoon, but with beer. Good game. Could use more upgrade options, not tied to story elements, though. As it is, it feels like you can't become Budweiser if you wanted to, only remain as a small-scale local brewer.  Galaxy on Fire 2 Space sim. I know its good, but I haven't played it much yet.  Open Tyrian Great game. 2D spaceship fighting game. On rails space shooter? I dunno, look up gameplay. hard to compare, except for games like Galaga, and it has ship upgrades with points you gather in each level. Lots of fun.  King's League Really fun team-management game. Gets a little repetitive, and its a bit short. The ending kind of snuck up on me.  Dungeon Quest Sort of like Torchlight, but simpler and more 'kiddie' in style. Not bad. I might stick to other ARPG options, though.  That's it for the first page of two. I'll edit in the other page later, although they're mostly all new games I downloaded as I opened up more space (after rooting), and so their quality is generally less than my first page."

AndroidGaming,39tppb,MadMonkey119,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:49:38 2015 UTC,"Here are three games with no in-app purchases and no ads:  Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars: The GTA most suited for mobile phones, in my opinion, since it was originally made for handhelds. The mission structure is good for on-the-go gaming, you can replay missions easily, the gunplay is relatively balanced for the touch controls, the touch screen is used to good effect, and the drug dealing side quest is its own game in and of itself. The little details in-game are also nice, like cops chasing down criminals, drivers getting out of their cars when they run over someone, and ambulances rushing to aid a pedestrian you shot at; it makes the city feel alive. Size-wise, it is also lighter on storage space than the console GTA games.  Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic: I'm cheating a bit because I had to uninstall this to make some space on my internal storage. But it's the classic Star Wars RPG everyone knows and mostly loves. I prefer the second game, but it's cool having this on my phone. I can also apply mods from the PC version to the mobile game, as well as transfer saves back and forth, so it's nice when I'm not near my computer.  Tien Len: Vietnamese Thirteen card game. This was the best aesthetically-looking offline Tien Len game with no ads that I could find on Google Play. No bluetooth or online multiplayer, however. So if you don't have a physical deck of cards with you, you'll have to make due with the CPU. At least you can change the difficulty to match your skill level."

AndroidGaming,39uiut,Gelu6713,2,Sun Jun 14 22:08:28 2015 UTC,Dominations is crap! Don't get started cause once you advance to the medieval age it becomes such a chore to farm. All the upgrade times are short still but take so much loot it's not balanced at all. Troop AI sucks even with being able to control every 30 seconds. I've been playing clash for over a year and I'm almost max th9 defenses. Clash is way more balanced and fun. Dominations clans are crap to because all you can do is donate I ran a clan on there for 4 or 5 months before I gave up. No one talks and you have to force people to donate before requesting to keep orders filled.
AndroidGaming,39uiut,FSC3D,1 point,Mon Jun 15 12:14:28 2015 UTC,So are you suggesting to get into clash since it's more balanced? What about boom beam instead
AndroidGaming,39uiut,FSC3D,2,Mon Jun 15 15:48:08 2015 UTC,Boom Beach is fun in its own right  I recommend it with clash at the same time. Switching between both is different enough to be fun! I log in to both multiple times daily even if I'm not raiding. The people is what make it for me! The game play of clash and base building fits that nostalgia of War craft 2 for me. Boom beach is a really neat strategy game as each raid can be examined for as long as you'd like or skipped. Both games keep being updated and evolving with the player base!

AndroidGaming,39t649,ceanji,3,Sun Jun 14 15:51:04 2015 UTC,Puzzle forge 2 is an interesting twist on it. The board is blank and you add your own ores to it and they combine into bigger ores. Ores with molds make item parts and item parts together make weapons and armour to fulfill orders. The challenge is in managing your board space as you can't move things and have limited ability to delete them.  Edit: In fact it's basically the same system as Triple Town.

However it is possible to run the original(not rebirth) demo version of the games .SWF flash file using a flash game player app on Android although when I tried it a long time ago it was very laggy. It's possible that with a combination of faster devices and updated flash player apps that you might be able to play the demo at a decent framerate now, but I don't really care to find out since it would be really tough for me to go back to the original after playing rebirth so much."

Definitely check out /r/Android, like HillDrag0n says, they'll be much more knowledgeable about this.  Also; can't really tell from the video on your site, but I suggest adding in a maximum firing distance (i.e., BaddieShip must be within Y meters of GoodieShip in order for LaserCannonOmega to begin firing), that way I can't drop in gunships on one end of the map and torp enemy cruisers on the other end."

AndroidGaming,39qnp9,walaska,6,Sat Jun 13 22:26:37 2015 UTC,"The only two hacks I've played are Light Platinum (based off of ruby) and Dark Rising 1 and 2 (based off of fire red). Light Platinum is more well done and has more of a generic Pokemon story line (albeit with more rivals). Dark Rising has a more compelling storyline imo, but it requires a lot of grinding (or rare candies) to keep up with trainers and wild Pokemon  Hope this helps a little bit."
AndroidGaming,39qnp9,chocobo22,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:35:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I'm a Pokemon fan but have never tried a hacked ROM. Assuming I am up to date on the games and have a 3ds, what do I get from hacked ROMs?"
AndroidGaming,39qnp9,Redd575,4,Sun Jun 14 02:46:51 2015 UTC,"The only thing you'd probably get out of it honestly is a new storyline. I haven't played actual pokemon games since white on the DS, so my experience with these roms is different. Most of the roms don't have the physical/special split that was introduced in gen 4 (I think dark rising 2 did), and dark rising 2 is also the only one I've played that had any pokemon from x and y. Dark rising 2 did not, however, have any fairy type pokemon or attacks despite having a few pokemon that should have been. In the description for most roms it'll tell you how many generations of pokemon can be found. I'm probably not the best source though because I've only played the three roms.   Tldr; new story with watered down game mechanics and fewer pokemon"
AndroidGaming,39qnp9,chocobo22,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:59:13 2015 UTC,"The good ones have awesome stories. Also some of them are much more difficult than the real ones.

AndroidGaming,39qnp9,Vermonster_802,12,Sun Jun 14 20:15:29 2015 UTC,"Game: 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors (999)  Genre: Visual Novel  Enjoyability rating ON TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:  This is a visual novel type game so it's not that action heavy. To follow the story, read the dialog and solve puzzles with simple taps.     Game: Professor Layton Games  Genre: Puzzle  Enjoyability rating ON TOUCH: 9/10  Reasoning:  Reason behind the 9/10 score is because these games are recommended to be played with the DS Stylus. Now don't worry, this will not ruin your day. The only slight issue, if you can even call it that, is that the game sometimes will ask for the answer to be written down, and if you are using your fingers this will provide mild inconvenience with the recognition thingy but it's not a huge hurdle to overcome.     Game:Miles Edgeworth Ace Attorney Investigations 1 & 2  Genre:Puzzle/Mystery  Enjoyability rating ON TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:  This is very similar to the Phoenix Wright series. In this spin-off the characters sprites are animated and you can walk around the place. The tap enjoyability is high because once you put your fingers on the screen the only thing lifting them up will be the low battery warning sound.     Game: Hotel Dusk - Room 215  Genre: Mystery/Puzzle  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:   This game is played sideways. The idea behind it was that you'd be holding the DS like you would a book so it might be slightly confusing at the first glance.The controls are fairly simple you use the touch screen to move, touch things access menus and even to open the detectives notebook and clumsily write things down.     Game: Golden Sun: Dark Dawn  Genre: RPG/Adventure  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 8/10  Reasoning:   Now the only reason that this is an eight is the fact that not everyone has 5 inch phones. Depending on the screen size of your phone using your finger to move the main character may prove to be difficult. Now of course this shouldn't be an issues for most of you. The entire game is playable using only the touch screen and its playing perfectly. I wouldn't want to miss this one,it's an amazing rpg.     Game: Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 1 & 2  Genre: Turn Based Strategy/RPG  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 8/10  Reasoning:   Well it's a strategy game which means you won't be fingering your screen in a panicking manner, but you'll be calmly making tactical decisions while sipping tea or something. The score is lower because I can't remember if some of the game interface wasn't accessible with only using the touch screen.     Game: Advance Wars - Dual Strike  Genre: Turn Based Strategy  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:  Well it's becoming kind of a trend by now but yes, turn based strategy games work great on phones, and this one in particular maybe more than the others.     Game: Jake Hunter - Detective Chronicles  Genre: Visual Novel  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:  This is another easy choice to make if you're concerned about touch screen controls. The game is played a lot like the Ace Attorney Series.     Game: Time Hollow  Genre: Visual Novel  Enjoyability rating on TOUCH: 10/10  Reasoning:   Yes,another visual novel. This one is about time travel if the title wasn't a big enough hint.     System: Nintendo Dual Screen (NDS)  Emulator used: Drastic  May eventually add more when I think of some other high tap enjoyability games"

System: PSP Enjoyability rating ON TOUCH: 7/10 (I cleared all 8 Floors and killed the Final Boss entirely with touch controls) Emulator used: PPSSPP Played on: 1.0-1.3 ghz Dual Core device with 512 MB RAM.   RENGOKU 2: Stairway to H.E.A.V.E.N. is a roguelite Action RPG with simple controls. Basically the game has a lock on button that you don't need to press and hold and it has simple movement/attack controls where one of the D-pad buttons control your movement while the 4 main action buttons fires the weapon equipped in the assigned limb (Head, Left Arm, Right Arm, and Torso).  Here's a Gameplay video of the Final Boss battle (in Spanish) so you can get some idea of how the game plays: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkbzcySmzJA  As for the progression, you play as a humanoid cyber-exoskeleton AI (Called an ADAM) that you can outfit with a variety of melee and ranged weapons like Guns, Rockets, Swords, Axes, Katanas, Flamethrowers, Missile Launchers, etc in each respective body part mentioned earlier. Though the game has you fighting nothing but other ADAMs; they all use a wide variety of equipment that you can steal after you kill them (though on the other hand, you can basically kill them with any build that suits your playstyle). Also you collect stuff called Elixir Skin which is used to level your HP, Defense, and Heat resistances respectively.  As for content, the game has 8 Main Floors that consist of most of the story. Completing all 8 Floors gives you H.E.A.V.E.N. A new gamemode with 100 little floors that basically works like a Roguelike where levels are randomly generated."

AndroidGaming,39qnp9,formerdigguser,-1,Sun Jun 14 14:47:42 2015 UTC,Yeah it really depends on the games you play I guess...   For example Kingdom Hearts:(forgot the subtitle) did work pretty well (around 70% speed)   But the Megaman remake game (forgot the name) was choppy and ran very slow
AndroidGaming,39qnp9,grawrz,0,Mon Jun 15 16:26:08 2015 UTC,Your phone shouldn't have a problem running it if it's not more than three years old or something. Maybe even then. The only problem is that there is only one psp emulator and I find its a little tricky to get a good configuration for the more graphically intense games to run smoothly.   It seems like there is always at least one little bug with every game but most of the time it's nothing major. Just don't even try Jeanne D'Arc.

I got totally hooked on the awesome Mechcommander 2 mods/remakes (MS opened the source to the original game and the MC2 community went nuts). That ran well and was a ton of fun.   Torchlight? About a handful of frames per second in netbook mode.  Shouldn't have reallyt labeled it that or called it a feature relevant to netbooks.

AndroidGaming,39mx2w,CiDhed,0,Sat Jun 13 15:52:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree, Torchlight 2 isn't even what Torchlight 2 should have been.  The class balance is wonky to all hell, the stat system tries too hard to be different and fails, harder differences are boring because enemies become spongey, especially bosses, and most importantly the skill ""tree"" is terrible: it's not a tree, it's three pages of skills, none of which have pre-requisites, meaning you can grab any skill from any tree, leading to homogeneity (i.e. if your character has multiple jump skills, then regardless of your tree you pick the best of them) - to limit progression, skills in lower tiers only become avaliable at high levels, for example, 30 and above, which makes much of the game a ridiculous bore if your character's build relies on such a high level skill, for example, Venomous Hail for a pistoleer Outlander."

Releasing the game with a flat price will mean they lose on 90% of the profits due to piracy. What other options do they have? Ads? Cosmetics? Let's be real, cosmetics don't make money unless you have millions upon millions of users like LoL. Not to mention that it's not on PC, it's on mobile, and mobile users don't tend to pay for content unless it's for premium p2w stuff."
AndroidGaming,39mx2w,sadshark,2,Sat Jun 13 16:11:12 2015 UTC,"Agree and disagree. Yes there's the real risk of piracy. Just look at the Monument Valley problem.

AndroidGaming,39qo7w,swbat55,5,Sat Jun 13 20:35:38 2015 UTC,The key with turn based multiplayer games is that they must have a catch up mechanic if they are more than a few turns. If the game allows a player to snow ball at the smallest lead the other player will simply quit. It's just not worth his time to keep playing.
AndroidGaming,39qo7w,Dont_Pan1c,3,Sat Jun 13 21:39:15 2015 UTC,Please please please listen to this guy. Too many devs focus on appealing to their user base rather than creating a good game. I do not care how many turns so long as my actions have consequences and I have meaningful actions I can take.

So for instance, you didnt want to wait for someone to make their turn you could play in real time where it had a ""take turn time counter"" say like 15-30 seconds. Thats the direction Im thinking of heading in. So far I already have a turn based mode in the works, but a realtime shouldnt be much more difficult."

AndroidGaming,39qo7w,CHEESY_ANUSCRUST,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"For a game like Hero Academy, I don't particularly care how many turns the match lasts so long as the opponent continues to respond in a timely manner. Each turn and response to the opponent in that game can be fun all the way up until the last one. I can imagine it would be a similar situation for other games, though it would depend on the genre. QuizUp or other real-time quiz games only have a few rounds, but require both players to be active. If you have the real time aspect, Dont_Pan1c's point is very valid, where one player making moves faster or responding to his phone more efficiently would get far ahead."

Well made and have addictive potential.  Here is some feedback, but I tell you.. this could be just me :).   1. The constant-hopping speed could be reduced, It felt like massive frame skipping since it was too fast. 2. The video reward message & the twitter follow message sometimes comes up just after PLAY dialogue shows up, I clicked the video twice by mistake when I was trying to go for Play.You can do better here by having a second button popup right under the play again option which can reward user or prompt user to follow you or rate the game. 3. Which network are you using for rewarded video ? I got black screens twice with no video to watch."
AndroidGaming,39pca1,The_STD_In_STUD,2,Sat Jun 13 16:31:00 2015 UTC,Wow thanks for the detailed feedback.   I will definitely look into this. For me after playing it for a while everything seems slow motion for me. I think my eyes just got conditioned to the fast speed.  I completely agree with you and I'm currently looking for ways on improving the reward message and twitter message.  I'm using Unity Ads for my rewarded video. I will look into why you are getting black screens. Can you suggest anything better? I've only been using Unity Ads because its super easy to integrate but I'm sure there is much better out there.   Once again thanks for the feedback!
AndroidGaming,39pca1,LordKwik,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:02:29 2015 UTC,"No worries mate. BTW game speed is perfect, I was just talking about the fast y-axis movement of the character when on a platform.

AndroidGaming,39okpg,Imasgrohn,9,Sat Jun 13 06:59:05 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the rant, but honestly, what's the point of cheaply made 3D games on mobile devices? Most of us wouldn't tolerate those visuals and gameplay on PC or console. I've played a few similar games on Android and while at first it is quite neat to have a 3D world to explore on a mobile device, in the end, every single one of those games is cheaply made, atrociously looking, hard to control and just not good at all.  While mobile devices are powerful enough for decent 3D graphics by now, they are just not the right platform for big 3D RPGs. Most bigger developers know this and that's why third-rate developers are rushing in to fill this ""gap"", because their games would be laughed at if they were to be released for PC or console. Look at the clipping, clumsy animations, low-res textures and empty landscapes in this video. Just because it might be ""good for a mobile game"" doesn't mean it's a worthwhile game per se.  Just to provide an example: Ravensword: Shadowlands is one of the most well-known 3D RPGs for mobile devices - it actually looks quite a bit better than whatever Angel Sword is supposed to be. User reviews are 4/5 stars on Google Play and 42% on Steam (professional reviews are similarly divided between PC and mobile). There are effectively no differences between those two versions - I've played both. Yet people are - for some reason - much more critical about it on PC. Why is that? Just because there are vastly superior alternatives available for PC, the game is still the same. Many players of the mobile version are playing it, because it's the closest they are getting to the Elder Scrolls and Gothic series on their smartphone and tablet. Those people should be aware of the various significant problems Ravensword has. Story, quest and world design, gameplay, controls, visuals, sound are all very poor, even on their own and especially when compared with superior games of the same genre.  Neither mobile nor PC players deserve those kinds of games. Some genres, like 3D RPGs or first person shooters, demand a developer that has access to a significant amount of expertise, manpower and money. Even with today's engines and tools being cheaper and easier to use than ever before, there is a real barrier preventing you from creating the next Elder Scrolls or Call of Duty on your own or with two or three of your best buddies."
AndroidGaming,39okpg,DdCno1,3,Sat Jun 13 15:06:51 2015 UTC,"Oh we're ranting? Neat.  Okay, first thing - vast majority of people won't play anything more complicated than Fruit Ninja... and that kind of sucks.  People prefer to play games on other platforms, like PCs or consoles, which is perfectly understandable, they're actually designed for playing games, they're way more powerful etc etc.  That's why play store is filled with (arguably) bad games. Typical smartphone user will pull out his device during his coffee break and play something silly for 20 minutes. Then he'll come back home and play on his ps4 or whatever - it's just a better alternative.  Developers don't really want to develop high end games for phones - as I said before, since people play only casual games, they probably won't buy anything complicated. Almost everyone I know has a bunch of simple games installed but nothing besides that. Hell, at this moment I only got 0h h1 and a bunch of similar puzzle games on my device.  So, the developer can do three things: make his game casual gamer friendly, add IAPs and release it for free (that usually works pretty well), release it for ~$10 and hope for 100 downloads (also this kinda games get pirated like crazy) or release it on PCs or consoles, where people might actually play it.  Of course there are some exceptions, but most of these are ports of PC games anyway.  Another thing - I played previous games by Dvide Arts and yeah, if they'd release them on PCs critics would shit on them. Example - Earth and Legend did a lot of things wrong - no randomized loot (there were literally 6 sets of armor and weapons, which makes like 100 items in total, including potions and shit like rings). Also most of them just give you slightly better stats), small world, mediocre graphics... It had multiplayer, that was kinda fun but this game was essentially grinding/doing simple quests like  ""bring x items to me""→ getting better armor → killing a boss → repeating til you beat the game. It had potential tho.  However that was like 3 years ago. I am extremely curious if they learned from their mistakes.  Typical android users are not quite ready for high end games. Hopefully this will change soon but as for now, you either stick to PCs and consoles or play casual games. Or if you really wanna play games on the go, get PS vita or 3DS."
AndroidGaming,39okpg,mboarder,2,Sat Jun 13 15:58:59 2015 UTC,"while it was no means a deep and strategic game , I actually enjoyed earth and legend for the small cost of 99p and at the time it provided quite a good few challenging hours even if most of the game was fetch quests and grinds but then most rpgs are built with the same tasks anyway , OK it was limited compared to many console games but fun to play for short periods which is what a mobile game should be , I agree that graphics and worlds could now be bigger and better on mobile but the general game needs to be made for a wide market and until everybody is using high end phones then developers will try to maximise for larger profit across android hardware. If this game is improved in terms of depth over earth and legend then I'm actually looking forward to it."
AndroidGaming,39okpg,mboarder,2,Sat Jun 13 19:26:35 2015 UTC,"I guess, Earth and Legend was kinda fun, but mostly because I played it with someone else. If I had to beat it in single player I probably would hate it.  This game is filled with bullshit. Like when you hit level 25 and you get the best gear in the game and you have to grind for 5 levels to get to the level cap. Or the fact that the world is pretty much a straight line and it's ridiculously small. Or that they implemented fishing but I only used that skill once, because of that one quest. Also speaking of quests, they're boring and there's not enough of them, which means more grinding. They did a lot of things wrong but hey, for 99p, sure, if you don't mind grinding it ain't that bad. I just hope they will look at games like Aralon or The Shadow Sun and say ""hey this is fun we should make a similar thing""."
AndroidGaming,39okpg,DdCno1,2,Sat Jun 13 19:47:34 2015 UTC,"your right about everything but it didn't make it particularly bad just very simple in game layout and design , I actually beat the game just out of sheer determination in the end but still it was worthwhile for a mobile game, I would say the game world is not used to full potential but many things such as budgets and dev limits could explain it. I hope they fill this new games world with more content and quests this time , Also aralon I thought sucked and shadow sun looks like a copy and paste of a combination of both aralon and earth and legend."
AndroidGaming,39okpg,Thomas-C,1 point,Sun Jun 14 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"Oh, absolutely.  The Aralon and The Shadow Sun bit though. I disagree.  Aralon is fantastic, really deep, it has hundreds of things to do and places to explore, it's a great rpg. People would like it on PCs as well. Of course it's not Skyrim or whatever but it's good. The graphics aren't the best but E&G is just as ugly. First 30 minutes might feel a bit slow but after that it's amazing. I never finished it but I played it for a bit and I did enjoy it - I'm planning on revisiting this game soon. My dad beat the whole thing twice and he thought it was pretty cool too.  Unfortunately, there's this GUI scaling bug which prevents you from playing the game on anything that is bigger than 5"". I played it on both 4"" and 4.5"" screens and it was perfectly fine. If you have a tablet, you're gonna have a really bad time playing it.  The Shadow Sun feels like a The Elder Scrolls rip off... but it's actually good, so whatever. This game feels like a high end rpg and I thought it was pretty good, there's a shitton of things to do in it.  IMO both Aralon and TSS were better than Earth and Legend in every possible aspect. But hey, opinions."
AndroidGaming,39okpg,xblackdemonx,2,Sun Jun 14 19:23:40 2015 UTC,"you either stick to PCs and consoles or play casual games   There is a third way. Well-made mobile games that have decent presentation and a concept that works on the small screen that are not just casual games. A great example is Hitman Go. It's a fairly simple, but well thought out puzzle game that actually has a unique and gorgeous look. It's not expensive, levels have just the right length and difficulty. Another great mobile game is The Room. Its puzzles are designed around the input methods available on mobile devices, not the other way around. Add to that a competent presentation and fair difficulty and you have a game that actually works better on smartphone or tablet than on PC, while at the same time being a excellent game on its own, not just a good mobile game."
AndroidGaming,39okpg,HephaestusXIII,3,Sat Jun 13 16:52:58 2015 UTC,"They work because they're puzzle games, which means casual gamers can play them for 10 minutes while enjoying a cup of whatever their preferred drink is. If we're talking about this kinda games, then sure, you are right. But when it comes to 3d RPGs then the best you can get are pc ports and they are not quite the same thing as an Android exclusive game.

AndroidGaming,39p2sd,NdemicCreations,1 point,Sun Jun 14 09:13:18 2015 UTC,What difficulty was your friend playing on? I remember they added an extra difficulty level which is harder than Brutal mode.

AndroidGaming,39p2sd,tomkatt,1 point,Sun Jun 14 10:22:57 2015 UTC,"No difference. Plague is worth the purchase.  That said, it's not hard to ""game"" the game. Boost your transmission and resistance rates until you've infected the entire world, get a partial refund for your points in transmission and such, and make your disease as lethal as possible with things like pulonary edema, seizures, coma, and the like.  It's easy when you get the hang of it (and when the RNG favors you)."

AndroidGaming,39m552,MadMonkey119,5,Fri Jun 12 18:28:46 2015 UTC,What differentiates this from Desert Golfing?
AndroidGaming,39m552,CrsIaanix,4,Fri Jun 12 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"Good question! As you can tell I was inspired by Desert Golfing however these are not the same game. I wanted something with more substance than Desert Golfing even though the game is renown for its minimalism.   Unlimited Golf takes a different approach by showing scores and pars as well as actively encouraging and rewarding good performance. There are different course types such as plains, mountains, ponds, forests and more which drastically change the holes. There is wind physics simulation. There is grass that behaves like grass and a ball rather than the purposefully annoying sand physics from Desert Golf. Plus I intend to support the game with a variety of new features and courses over time!  Edit:Also you can follow the games progress on  https://voat.co/v/unlimitedgolf"

AndroidGaming,39m552,thewretchedspawn,2,Sat Jun 13 05:29:25 2015 UTC,Are you playing on Android? Because I have:   cactus in hole 316 water in hole 446 and 501 rock in hole 537 cloud in hole 684   It must be some kind of glitch if you haven't seen anything yet. I would ask for a refund!
AndroidGaming,39m552,thewretchedspawn,2,Sat Jun 13 05:46:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm playing on android. It does say that they are randomly generated holes so maybe mine are just getting randomly generated differently. And I only get water maybe every 200 holes or so.

That said, I'm still playing so clearly the rest of the game makes up for it."
AndroidGaming,39m552,IHerdYouLiekMudkipz,2,Fri Jun 12 19:40:01 2015 UTC,I agree. I like the game but I think the spin needs to be a big priority. I haven't found much consistency between angle and spin direction either
AndroidGaming,39m552,SomeoneUShldKno,1 point,Fri Jun 12 21:05:25 2015 UTC,I'm glad you like it. I will continue to look into improving spin as well as consistency.
AndroidGaming,39m552,SatNav,2,Fri Jun 12 21:10:18 2015 UTC,It isn't intentionally random. My goal is to have no spin or to find a good way for a player to purposefully spin the ball.
AndroidGaming,39m552,nahfoo,3,Fri Jun 12 19:59:40 2015 UTC,"I'd shoot for having no spin first. Honestly, just keep trying at it.

However even when it was laggy at times with many enemies on screen, v. 1.4.0 played pretty well. I'm just not sure what they've changed in v. 1.5.0 to cause a total failure to load.  And just to put this out there I unfortunately never logged into the game with G+ (kept getting a ""license check failed"" error, which I wasn't able to resolve until I went back and forth between versions trying to login to port progress...but was a moot point by then, as without a full login....), so if any of my progress would have been saved via that.... well, can't even try until the next update maybe enables me to login at least once on the S3."

AndroidGaming,39jl0o,TheIrateSPider,3,Fri Jun 12 17:50:00 2015 UTC,"TBH, I'd rather you just play whichever one you would prefer :)   When it comes which nets more, it really depends on how much the user plays I imagine. Some people will play a game like this once and never again, in those cases the up front cost of a paid version or an IAP to remove ads would net more. In other cases some players become just obsessed and play a round every time they have to kill a minute or two, in which case the ads would probably wind up netting more over time. Either way though, i'm more concerned with how the user wants to play the game, thats why this version exists now.  Thanks for the support :)"

AndroidGaming,39jl0o,Colindapieman,13,Fri Jun 12 10:06:58 2015 UTC,Yah. It's a very recent addition to the play store. As a developer you answer a bunch of questions and then it applies different ratings for all the different territories. It's neat because if I remember correctly whhen I was releasing a steam game last year it would have cost money to apply for ratings. Though I'm certain the ratings will largely be ignored as usual by the general public and parents will be furious at everyone else but themselves when they let their own child play an m rated game.

In the US alone, Android phones take up just over 50% (52%?) are smartphone owners. Most of those people are people who need their phones for business, casual use,  or are a younger audience who don't care about actual quality.  Witcher 3 being a standard for AAA games as it's recently been called makes sense, because it's developed for a platform for gamers.  Phones,  especially the  Android platform, don't really market to just one demo like gaming companies do.

AndroidGaming,39k1s0,Larrynho,2,Fri Jun 12 10:58:15 2015 UTC,"Not lootable per se, but Shadowrun Returns is a third-person isometric RPG and is incredibly well done. There's also SR: Dragonfall, which is called an expansion but is essentially a new campaign in the same engine. Hong Kong will be coming out soon as well.   EDIT: Apparently they're also cheap as hell. 2 bucks for Returns, 3 for Dragonfall. Worth every penny."
AndroidGaming,39k1s0,Gorphax,2,Fri Jun 12 07:49:52 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend Returns. Dragonfall includes improvements to the engine and gameplay. Returns feels more like a throwback to the SNES and Genesis games both in its own little ways. Dragonfall is a campaign proper and much improved, IMO. Plus the character development and plot are several rungs higher."
AndroidGaming,39k1s0,LoveRecklessly,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"It's true, Dragonfall is generally better from a technical standpoint. I haven't finished it (PC) so I can't say for sure which game is a better introduction to the setting/world for new players."
AndroidGaming,39k1s0,Gorphax,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:48:36 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's Dragonfall by a mile. I enjoyed Returns because I've been a big fan of the Genesis version and interested in the Shadowrun mythos since I was a kid.   For a complete casual however? Dragonfall is just the better all around package. Although I do think Returns captures elements of the setting that Dragonfall doesn't and vice versa.   If you're cool with 5$, get both. If you want to dip your toes in the water, get Dragonfall."

AndroidGaming,39fjbp,Cheloo16Hz,6,Thu Jun 11 18:14:25 2015 UTC,It's not just you. The Android port was thrown together quickly and with very little optimization done. I think the original port was even running on top of an abstraction layer of sorts (on top of Java).

AndroidGaming,39fjbp,Madmanquail,3,Thu Jun 11 12:26:16 2015 UTC,Can you outline the difference between the two games?
AndroidGaming,39fjbp,Intuition17,4,Thu Jun 11 16:55:27 2015 UTC,"Threes- Numbers are multiples of three. Aesthetically, the game oozes style and character.  2048- Numbers are in multiples of two.

AndroidGaming,39fjbp,skipjimroo,11,Thu Jun 11 18:59:41 2015 UTC,there are functional differences too.  In Threes! a swipe moves all the tiles that are able to move one space in the direction you swipe.  Whereas 2048 moves the tiles as many spaces as are available.  I think Threes! is a much better game.
AndroidGaming,39fjbp,aspbergerinparadise,2,Thu Jun 11 19:34:30 2015 UTC,Threes! also shows you what tile is coming into the grid next. The new tile always enters from the side opposite your swipe.
AndroidGaming,39fjbp,FungalCactus,3,Thu Jun 11 21:56:33 2015 UTC,"also there's the fact that you can't combine a ""1"" with another ""1"" and the same with ""2""s"

AndroidGaming,39fjbp,Charwinger21,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:29:26 2015 UTC,"Gameplay-wise, the smallest numbers are 1 and 2 in threes, and they have to combine to get 3s, while in 2048 the smallest number is only 2. Also, a swipe in 2048 moves everything to one side, while a swipe in threes moves everything one space. It makes specific moves easier, but the board can fill up quickly if you're not paying attention!  The score is tallied by what tiles you have left on the board, so no matter what, a bigger score is better, whereas in 2048, you get points for each move, and it's debatable whether a bigger score is better or worse."
AndroidGaming,39fjbp,LimeGreenTeknii,1 point,Thu Jun 11 21:10:37 2015 UTC,"Threes! requires strategy and planning.  2048 requires a few simple rules to remember (pick two directions and stick with them for as long as you can, then hope you get lucky with the third direction)."

AndroidGaming,39hv9w,mboarder,7,Thu Jun 11 20:40:33 2015 UTC,"Hi mboarder.  I just want to say a couple things that come to mind as a no name developer. The more I read and try to learn about how to be successful at releasing small games, the more I see that free to play is succeeding in a variety of ways and is easily the most attractive to developers.  The most important way, is by removing the cost you effectively remove all barriers to entry for a player and it makes it so easy for a player to jump into a product and try it to see if they like it.  This really makes a huge cut in the profits of those trying to release games that cost money upfront and have no IAPs, ads and whatnot. People (not necessarily purposefully) will dismiss a paid product in favour of a free one almost all the time.  Personally I am not a fan of the type of game the wants you to pay to speed up gameplay and what not, but hey, there are plenty of people that are crazy about that type, and there are way more of them.   Currently I just make games that are ad-supported with a single IAP to remove the ads, I feel like this is the best middle ground developers have found so far to appease the majority of players. Those that don't want to pay, get to play for free and see some ads, while others (like myself) will pay a buck or two after a couple minutes playing and realizing they like the game.  Hopefully the market with level out and become more reasonable in the future and it will be more up front and consumer friendly, but hey, thats not the way its going in other markets like consoles and pcs (preorder bonuses, dlc baked in) so who knows.  I basically forgot the main point I wanted to make but kept typing anyways. Hopefully any of this is worthwhile :)"
AndroidGaming,39hv9w,nickervision,4,Fri Jun 12 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"As someone who is not a dev, I have no problems with this type of IAP (remove ads). I also don't mind ftp when it's only a demo and payment unlocks the rest of the game, IAPs for vanity items are also fine. I won't buy them, but as long as they aren't vital or lead to a completely unequal pvp experience, I don't begrudge their existence.   I'm wary of bonus content IAPs, but if the game I paid for is fully formed and the dev continues to put in work on new levels (not ones that should have been included in initial payment), then that's cool too. However, I do understand that from a new customer's perspective, it's hard to tell what should have been included with the basic package and not all devs have scruples.  Just my 2 cents."
AndroidGaming,39hv9w,UnmarkedDoor,6,Fri Jun 12 12:21:56 2015 UTC,"Just turn off mobile data on your phone.  If the game then doesn't work, don't play it and choose one that does.  This isn't meant to be dismissive, but it means that only games that cater for what the players want will get played, and thus the devs of the other games will notice a drop in ad income."

Even when I'm in transit or something, generally I'm emulating retro games on my phone, reading a book, or watching local video on microSD external, so no need for youtube or anything.  Even when it comes to the games I'm playing, I use FAQr to download the FAQs for any games I'm playing or plan to be playing soon. I'll use data for that generally though, I mean, the average FAQ is what, like 50 - 300kb? That's practically nothing.  Email sync is also pretty simple, and on my phone I only sync back 10 days, don't really need any more than that.   Very occasionally I'll download an app, but that's generally when I know I have the overhead for it, and even then, I'm not huge on instant gratification, it's not like I can't make a note of it and download it when I get home and connect to wifi."

AndroidGaming,39jlq9,Megalokk,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:14:42 2015 UTC,Honestly heroes charge is the best of this genre. I tried the angel one (forgot the name) and the anime one and both just were so clunky and felt rushed beyond belief. Also tried marvel future fight but two issues I found with it was the amount of time you needed for each dungeon run and the scarcity of raid tickets to bypass running the dungeon manually. The reason I like heroes charge so much is that you can just burn through your energy in 5 minutes with raid ticket. Can't stand it where you need an hour to burn through all your energy.

Really good controller. Tight controls. Good buttons. The only downsides I've found is that the way the phone is mounted on the top of the controller makes it uncomfortable for long durations of play. Also the games formatted for the moga are somewhat limited. The phonejoy was a recent buy. Way more comfy for long play. Haven't had a chance to get into all the games yet, but the phonejoy app has way more games then the moga.  I really love the way the phonejoy gets so compact for travelling. Even comes with its own nifty travel case. The only downside I found with the phonejoy is the thumbsticks are a little stubby for my taste and the position of the thumbstick on the right of the pad can make it difficult to use the shoulder buttons. I would recommend both controllers. Hope this helped. I had a hard time trying to figure out with controller would be a good buy."

The sticks and buttons work great. The triggers are stiff, but work. The thumb buttons under the sticks are stiff and don't activate if the stick is not near full upright.  Love the arm to hold. Traveling is easy and it works with a tablet.  For those reasons with a few shortfalls, I like it more than my other controllers. Oh and the software isn't great, but in normal Android controller mode I have yet to find incompatibility. If you combine with tincore, you can play almost anything with the controller."

I actually prefer it to my PS3 controller now, oddly enough, and wish I could use it when PC gaming.

AndroidGaming,39b8uv,bws201,11,Wed Jun 10 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"A global rollout   Not really related to the console itself, but yeah, more markets is good.   Experiences you can’t get elsewhere   Already the only 4K set-top box, and the only real in-home streaming box until the Steam Link comes out. And who wants exclusive games? What developer is going to make a game solely for the Shield console? I am sure Nvidia would love an actual exclusive, but I think it would be more worthwhile to port over 10 good games rather than develop an entire game.   Pack in a smaller controller   I think updating the controller a bit would be nice and it could probably be slimmed down a bit, but I don't see it as being huge. It fits my hands about the same as a 360 controller, and is actually a bit more comfortable. What I would absolutely not do is make an alternate controller with a different feature set. If they dropped any buttons that would mess up compatibility, the only things they could possibly drop would be the touchpad or headset jack, which are great to have at times. Having two controllers would just complicate things.   Android TV needs an upgrade   This is really a matter of Google updating Android TV and app developers bringing their apps over. I am not really sure what Nvidia would do here.   At least bundle in the remote    Would be great to include the remote, and I really don't understand how it could cost that much. The full controller is only $10 more.   4K isn’t ready for everyone   I am not sure what the authors point is here. 4K is bad because not everyone has the internet/TV to support it? It might be wasted on most people right now, but might as well put that power to use somewhere.   Throw in more storage   Yeah, the base model needs to be 32GB. Although I am not sure why people recommend getting an SD card when a USB 3.0 flash drive would be much cheaper and faster. You can even throw a gigantic USB hard drive on there if you want to."

AndroidGaming,39b8uv,thetaprime,2,Wed Jun 10 18:29:47 2015 UTC,If each pixel took up 2 pixels wouldn't it lower the resolution?
AndroidGaming,39b8uv,Roalith,2,Thu Jun 11 11:33:47 2015 UTC,"Or, you know, stream from your beast pc. 4k pc monitors don't seem nearly as common as TVs, and shield's in-home streaming is actually pretty solid on gigabit."
AndroidGaming,39b8uv,bakageta,2,Wed Jun 10 22:29:44 2015 UTC,But streaming 4K resolutions??  I highly doubt that would be smooth in any way even on 1Gb.
AndroidGaming,39b8uv,thetaprime,2,Wed Jun 10 22:34:31 2015 UTC,"Netflix only does ~16MBps for 4k, you could easily quadruple that locally even with just a single gigabit switch in your router. 4k bluray is only planned for 100MBps, a tenth of your bandwidth.  I have my heavy traffic devices on one switch, with light traffic and the switch's uplink on my gigabit router. Maxing out two devices on the switch (htpc and storage system) makes no difference in the rest of the lan's performance. Latency should be no different than existing local wired shield streaming, which has been very good in my experience."
AndroidGaming,39b8uv,bakageta,2,Wed Jun 10 23:37:23 2015 UTC,"Actually,  I knew that,  but duh me today.  4k game streaming just sounds like a lot.  I keep forgetting they do it with h.264 codecs, so it does make sense."
AndroidGaming,39b8uv,thetaprime,2,Thu Jun 11 00:27:20 2015 UTC,"With games designed to run off of significantly less powerful and more efficient phone processor?  Hell yes! It's actually pretty genius when you think about it. Hardware to push 4k Android games will be much, much more affordable than literally $1000 minimum 4k gaming rigs."
AndroidGaming,39b8uv,atfsix,1 point,Thu Jun 11 10:32:19 2015 UTC,"You obviously don't have a SHIELD. I have the tablet and the shield library includes high/PC quality games. It can also stream from your computer (I play a variety of Steam 'Big Screen' games that are controller friendly) or from the nVidia Grid service.   It's not about playing Flappy Bird and Clash of Clans...   It's about using Android as a platform to deliver high quality gaming experiences in different physical formats. Mobile, tablet, console..."
AndroidGaming,39b8uv,CircumcisedSpine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:33:56 2015 UTC,"The throughput on the Shield can't match that of a GPU on a modern gaming PC. That I do know. There are some PC titles it can undoubtedly run but not with the same shader quality, texture size and effects like AA and anisotropic filtering.  I have no doubt it can perform like a gaming PC from 5 years ago, , but it requires some pretty smooth tricks by devs to run the high poly, large texture games of today. With streaming however, your options jump quite a bit."
AndroidGaming,39b8uv,thetaprime,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:45:24 2015 UTC,Streaming is also beneficial for battery life on the tablet. You can get about 5x more life out of the battery by streaming a game than playing the same game natively on the tablet.

AndroidGaming,399ni6,OleGravyPacket,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:07:47 2015 UTC,"Well, a customer forgot a tattered old touchscreen glove at my store about a year ago, but all I used it for (before throwing it out) was my basic phone functions: feedly, andchat, SMS, etc. It seemed to work fine enough for that, but I really wasn't paying attention to the actual performance. I was just dinking around with the first conductive glove I'd ever had the chance to use.  But, sadly, I'm not terribly surprised to hear that they're pretty damn lousy. But for whatever reason I was still holding out hope that there's a conductive glove/fingertip out there that's (nearly) as accurate as a bare finger without the periodic spikes of high friction or loss of conduction when you accidentally roll your finger too far towards fleshy grip or too far back onto nail that looses touch signal."

AndroidGaming,397wc0,kadmo,9,Tue Jun 9 22:05:47 2015 UTC,"I bought that game when it was on sale for $5. It's really buggy and I'm not sure if it's worth the time. Here are some issues I found:   It's not compatible with lollipop according to the previous thread I made. Online Multiplayer is dead since it relies on Gamespy. (Which has been shut down). The game doesn't work reliably. When I tap on the app icon, sometimes it will work, sometimes it won't. A phone reboot usually fixes it but not always. The archer is gimped solo. :( Best class for soloing is definitely the apprentice. Local Wifi Multiplayer works... sometimes.    Here are the good points:   The game is feels just like it does in the PC version.  When local wifi multiplayer works, it's great and actually fun! That is, if you have the patience to setup the game.   My personal recommendation: If you only wanted that specific game for Android, don't buy the Bundle."

AndroidGaming,3958jx,shsourov,0,Tue Jun 9 13:10:45 2015 UTC,ymbab is just a reskin of that game. the dev just pulled a kairo with this (kairo is kinda infamous for reakinning their game)
AndroidGaming,3958jx,firebane,2,Tue Jun 9 13:17:51 2015 UTC,There is a lot more going on in YMBAB than 10000000

AndroidGaming,3958jx,firebane,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:55:58 2015 UTC,Sometimes its not the content a lone but the game play. By changing something too much you'll cause people to really not like it.    I personally like the game and feel its different enough from the first to warrant the purchase.
AndroidGaming,3958jx,shsourov,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:57:44 2015 UTC,the one thing I dislike a lot about this game and probably this is the reason I'm struggling to have a positive opinion in this game is I can't lose and I always win? but it's gameover. it gets boring after awhile seeing you win everytime although I know I lost. the game is being really shallow and trying to pretend that I won lol that was really annoying for me lol. but hey that's just my opinion and we're allowed to have different opinions
AndroidGaming,3958jx,firebane,2,Tue Jun 9 14:05:06 2015 UTC,I will agree that I dislike the you can never lose aspect of it but it just makes it more silly.

AndroidGaming,393vvf,grawrz,18,Tue Jun 9 01:59:26 2015 UTC,"Here's a quick review of the games I've tried:   Timelines: Assault on America - an actual complete RTS game. It has base building, tech research, unit manufacturing, etc. It looks like a Command & Conquer: Generals game. Controls are a bit finicky though and takes some getting used to. You need to have an internet connection to start SP missions though. :( Ministry of Silly Walks - endless runner based on Monty Python. It has 3 obstacles that you either jump, double jump or slide through. The game collects coins for costumes or to upgrade the powerups. It's really meh. Hellraid - ETC won't install on my phone (THL5000) or tablet (Samsung Note 8.0) :/ Files are too big for me to try all versions. Puzzle Retreat - This is the game I spent most of my time on. This is a really good puzzle game that had me cycling from ""Shit, This puzzle is hard"" to ""FUCKY YEAH I'M AWESOME"" at every level. I'm pleasantly surprised at how good this game is. Just a warning: at the start, tap on all the levels to ""claim"" them. The other levels disappear for some reason if you start playing without claiming all of them first, and there's no way to unlock them without having to reinstall the game. Worms 3 - pretty much the same as Worms 2, except this version has on screen buttons for actions. So no need to struggle with the gestures to jump backward or jump forward. Twisty Hollow - another puzzle game. It's sort of like match 3, but you match a butcher with a knife and a pig, then match that with a client that wants to eat bacon. First few tutorial levels are boring, but it really picks up after the 6th level when the patience timer on the clients becomes really short. PUK - If you've gotten OLO from the previous bundle, it's like that, but this is single player. It's basically Shuffle Board where you have to hit targets, but the catch is that there's a timer. It's very fast paced. Also, the sound track is AMAZING. Good thing HB bundled the OST with the game! :D Jump'N'Shoot Attack - This is a homage to Megaman games. The difference is that this is an auto runner and you only control the Jumping and the Shooting. This game is hard as nails. If I recorded a game, it will look like a death montage lol. It's very difficult and I think only really dedicated people can play through this.   Personally, I think 3.24 (as of this writing) is worth it to get a lot of levels in Puzzle Retreat and the OST for PUK."
AndroidGaming,393vvf,PSBlake,5,Tue Jun 9 02:20:55 2015 UTC,"I got it primarily for Timelines, but didn't realize it required an Internet connection until afterwards. It's a good game. Wish it had an offline mode. It's odd that it requires a connection, though, since Humble Bundle's description of the bundle specifically talks about gaming without an Internet connection.  Hellraid looks cool, but like you, it wouldn't install for me."

AndroidGaming,393vvf,diagonally_stacked,4,Tue Jun 9 06:06:31 2015 UTC,It comes into its own as an extremely relaxed game you can pass around a few friends whilst you're hanging out. I've never really enjoyed it on my own.

There's a campaign mode where you get rewards for every 4 matches you win as well as a multiplayer tournament.  The players are all fictional, however, which is my only gripe. You can't 'collect' LeBron James or Kevin Durant, which I was pretty sad about.  If you want to give it a try, you can enter my code 'D9CF2N' for a free premium pack for a chance at a gold player."

AndroidGaming,391nod,superhappyrobots,2,Mon Jun 8 18:14:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah same with me, lagged when unlocked some achievements"
AndroidGaming,391nod,superhappyrobots,3,Mon Jun 8 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! I've had a play and it's fairly solid and simple - which I definitely like. As for areas that could be improved;   On my Nexus 5 running the Android M preview, the FPS seems a little low. Even from the very start of a new game, the triangle movement feels juddery. There's no reason why, in a simple 2D game like this, you shouldn't be reaching a smooth 60 FPS. As mentioned in other comments, around four achievements came up just as I started my first game. That's very excessive IMO and you definitely don't want to distract new users in this way. The difficulty scaling once you reach ten points is very sudden and jarring. I feel it would work a lot better if there were a sliding scale - where difficulty got progressively harder - rather than ""buckets"" of difficulty."
AndroidGaming,391nod,superhappyrobots,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"Hey SuperHappyRobots - Thanks for looing at the game.   Stuttering/slowdown - That appears to be an issue with the way I'm handling achievements. I've added what I hope is a fix, but I'm still testing just in case. I do absolutely agree I was very bottom heavy with the achievements - In retrospect I didn't give them the attention they deserved when setting them up. I donlt think there's a way I can change them now the game has been published - But  I will take that on-board should I write any more. Speed scale - I can change. Part of the problem developing solo is losing perspective on players who haven't played before. I'll see what I can do to 'ease' the speed increase in& add it to an update this week.   Cheers for the feedback superhappyrobots - It really helps!"

I'm going to spend tomorrow looking my setup more closely, but if I'm not getting anywhere in a day or so & if you don't mind, I may bug you with a question or two about where I'm going wrong?"

I suspect there is a step or two I'm missing in my attempt to recreate the issue.  Could you give me a little more info on your setup? - I'm guessing no sim with wifi?  & also, what happened? what were the steps you took? - Downloaded update, attempted to sign-in, dialog opens & you select 'continue'?

Dead Effect was fun while it lasted. I wasn't really a fan of FPS games on phones but I really enjoyed this game. Joe Dever's Lone Wolf is a great game. I've posted about it a lot of times in this sub. Neuroshima Hex is a really good adaptation of the board game. The HB version has all the factions unlocked so it's far superior to the Play Store version. My only complaint is that there's no online multiplayer. :( The Room Two is a great ""escape the room"" game. It's very atmospheric and best played with earphones. It's also a bit scary so its good for horror junkies."

AndroidGaming,3922fm,PlayStoreLinks__Bot,2,Tue Jun 9 00:06:03 2015 UTC,"Right now for me it's Crusader's Quest.  It's a cute RPG game but is a heavy heavy grind.  It scratches the ""need to grind"" itch.  The asthetic is cute and the soundtrack is fun.  It's F2P but it runs three concurrent timers (one of which can essentially be used to fill up another one) and has a special dungeon that resets every day, so  even through it's F2P if you're at max level and waking up to full resources you can get a solid hour, hour and a half of playtime before you bottom out.   It also has a pokemon-esque type system where you rescue heroes, and then promote them into other heros.  There are six ""levels"" of promotion, and from 1 star to 3 star you get random heroes, then from 4 to 6 you get ""master"" class ones that stay the same from rank 4 to 6, just get increased abilities. Most of the good heroes can only be obtained by using the premium currency, but it's not terribly difficult to get once you get rolling.  But yeah, like I said earlier, it's a pretty serious grind.  link me: Crusader's Quest"

You can program the games in Javascript or C#.  I've developed a few small games in it even though I had absolutely no previous experience in game development and almost no programming background."
AndroidGaming,392sn1,andre-lima,2,Mon Jun 8 21:12:42 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll check it out.  I was planning on making a side scrolling shooter with puzzle elements and a story. Is 3D going to be harder?
AndroidGaming,392sn1,andre-lima,2,Mon Jun 8 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"3D is harder since it deals with 3D models, meshes, lighting, 3 dimensions, and such. But Unity's workflow is designed for 3D, so it makes everything almost as simple as making a 2D game.  As I said before, I knew almost nothing about game development when I made these games: my awesomely short experimental games  So you could make something similar or better, since you already know Javascript and GameMaker."
AndroidGaming,392sn1,EdgeMentality,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:43:18 2015 UTC,"As I recall unity requires a paid license for android publishing? Great tool, unreasonable if you intend to go beyond just making the game, such as publishing and distribution. A lot of other cool stuff is locked behind a license. You'll have to ask your artist if 3d feels reasonable, that is where most of the differences would be.  Edit: old info, apparently unity got really indie friendly since last I gave it a chance"
AndroidGaming,392sn1,andre-lima,3,Mon Jun 8 21:33:51 2015 UTC,Yes. They are a lot better now. Android is free and they have native 2D and GUI functionality that makes 2D games a lot easier then before.
AndroidGaming,392sn1,thewildnath,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:41:10 2015 UTC,You can also make 2D with Unity. Check /r/Unity2D and /r/Unity3D for more examples. Do you have any programing knowledge?

It also have a very active community and there are plenty of platforming tutorials around to get you going. If you decide to check it out, a recommendation is to not to code in MonoDevelop, but instead use notepad++, sublime text or VS.    In Unity you can either program using a version of javascript or C#. I do recommend you to use C# thought because many tutorials and most people (I think) are using it."
