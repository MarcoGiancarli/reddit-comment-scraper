It's still drawn as a gable roof.    There's at least one labeled as a gambrel roof, but not very useful without seeing it from the side.  Under ""manufactured"", those are just trailers.  An actual  manufactured home could look just like a regularly built house, and can even be a two-story.  Is ""McMansion"" really an official term now?  I'm not very well-versed in architecture, but I know a lot about their structural aspects.  These few things make me think there are other errors or misrepresentations of some sort, potentially incomplete even.  Still, a very cool graphic.  Would look nice framed."

coolguides,3d524g,marshsmellow,17,Mon Jul 13 23:42:37 2015 UTC,"Basically olive oil with truffle flavoring added in. It's very strong, and can quickly over power a dish when added. Chefs and foodies tend to hate it, 1.) because of the pungent taste, but 2.) they've also gone on a witch hunt against it due to it being made with synthetic ingredients. The main aroma compound in question is 2,4-Dithiapentane, which is naturally occurring in truffles and various cheeses and things. However, when producing truffle oil, that compound is synthetically produced. Nevermind that it's still a chemical equivalent, it still sets off people's ""artificial ingredients"" alarm. It's about as fake as the synthesized Vitamin C that goes into your daily multivitamin, which is to say, it's the same damn thing. I've seen people say it's indigestible and super bad for you, but I've never seen any actual real evidence of those claims. In my mind, it equates to people saying how terrible gluten is for you. I tried looking for some scholarly articles pertaining to it's metabolization and why it's so bad for you, but didn't really have any luck. If someone does have some reputable sources they can pass along, I'd gladly welcome being put in my place if it means I learn something.   edit: I should also add that being indigestible isn't automatically grounds for something being bad for you anyway. I mean, it can be, in cases like lactose intolerance and stuff. But we tend to eat all kinds of things we can't fully digest/metabolize anyway. Ever poop out corn or peanuts? We don't have the enzymes necessary to break down cellulose, a plant fiber, so those things can stay in pretty good shape as they travel through you. Again, just because something is indigestible, doesn't necessarily mean it's bad for you."

Also, the rep ranges are bullshit. If you can do more than about 20 reps of an exercise, you need to add weight/resistance to make it more difficult if you want to stimulate muscle growth.

It used to be that people would downvote you because they disagreed with you (which they shouldn't do anyway, but whatever); now it's to the point that they'll downvote you if something in your comment vaguely sounds like you might not be 100% in favour of whatever circlejerk happens to be going on right this instant. It's almost more about your phrasing than your content.  ""Only downvote comments that don't contribute to the discussion"" has always sounded like a wildly optimistic ideal, but these days it sounds more like it was written by someone who'd never even been on reddit.  Your comment was totally reasonable; don't let the downvotes get to you. They're just imaginary internet points, after all."

coolguides,3cn7iz,-Wire-,2,Sun Jul 12 20:00:58 2015 UTC,Skip filler. Especially when the show is like 50+ episodes. If you go to wikipedia it will tell you which seasons are filler.  Most anime comes from comic books. Filler is when the show produces episodes to buy the author time to push out another chapter of the comic. You aren't missing anything.  Bleach is 45% filler.
coolguides,3cn7iz,Tatsko,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:58:14 2015 UTC,"I've never seen bleach so take my suggestions with a grain of salt, but it's a member of a genre called ""battle shounen,"" shows that have more of an emphasis on the plot advancement and action than character development - HunterXHunter (2011) is generally agreed to be the single best in the genre at the moment.  It's a bit long, I think 112 episodes, but I've heard literally nothing but good things about it.  If you want something a bit shorter, Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is about 62 episodes and (from what I know of Bleach) has some similarity in the overall tone of the show, and comes with the bonus of being a complete masterpiece - it's the #1 rated show on myanimelist.net, coming in at an average score of 9.25/10."

coolguides,3cn7iz,Tatsko,2,Wed Jul 15 06:48:16 2015 UTC,"I took the test. I want to see more anime, as I stopped years ago.  I was never a real connaisseur, but I really enjoyed those I watched. I feel good animes excel at delivering surprising plot twists, engaging action with consequences and character investment. Also they do marvelous banter, roadtrip, sci-fi and magic.  From the chart and reading the synopsis in My Anime List, here's my anime list:   Code Geass Gintama Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun Eureka Seven Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica Aria the Animation (I have my doubts about this one. It depends on the setting and the type of ""valuable life lessons"" learned.) Shirobako   If anyone cares to chime in, I'll be humbly grateful for your insight on any of those."
coolguides,3cn7iz,TheMemoman,2,Thu Jul 9 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"I have a few recommendations if you are up for it.  Firstly, I would recommend the following be added to your list based on what you listed (not sure if you have seen any of these)   Gurren Lagann and Stiens;Gate  And although it is only sort of relevant I think you may also like Nichijou. It is a very laid back and relaxed anime which is much different than all the ones you picked but if you can appreciate the surreal humor you will come to like it.   Now as for your list I have only personally seen 3of those.   Code Geass is awesome. I have never met anyone who didn't like it. It does get a little weird at times but for the most part it is good stuff.   Modoka Magica. I kind of liked this. I was personally not very interested at first but it got interesting pretty quickly plus I believe it was only 12 or 13 episodes. Do make sure to watch subbed for this one.  Gintama. A lot of people do like this one I stopped watching like 2 episodes in for some reason and never picked it back up.   If you really like Code Geass definitely be sure to check out gurren lagann. If you like Modoka Magica, be sure to check out Stiens;Gate and possibly Nichijou."

In a word: Yessssssssssssssssss  That sounds right up my alley, I'll check it out. I'll check all of your three recommendations. Thanks for sharing. I haven't thought about number of episodes, but I'll consider that before diving in. I'd like to make some progress on that list."
coolguides,3cn7iz,Firrox,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:18:53 2015 UTC,Awesome!   I believe Code Geass is the longest of the mentioned ones. It is around 50 episodes long. nichijou and others are all 24 ish. Nichijou is nice to watch if you don't have a lot of time because it doesn't really follow a story and the episodes are broken down into parts.
coolguides,3cn7iz,bashfulfax,2,Thu Jul 9 19:40:34 2015 UTC,"Of those shows,  I really enjoyed Madoka and Shirobako, so definitely have fun with those.   A word of warning with Gintama though: it's massive.  Getting into it might be hard so good luck."
coolguides,3cn7iz,_GrinReaper,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:01:32 2015 UTC,That's a fair warning! Thank you.
coolguides,3cn7iz,capplay,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:54:19 2015 UTC,"Code Geass is an incredibly smart show, but in my opinion it suffered from trying to add some generic highschool drama elements around the middle. Still a great show, though!   Madoka Magica is my second favorite show,  I think it's an absolute masterpiece!  It does a fantastic job of portraying human emotion incredibly realistically, and their method of storytelling is unique and well-done.  The show benefits from you knowing as little about it as possible going into it, so I'm just gonna say you have to watch three episodes before you're allowed to judge it!   Those are the only two you listed that I've seen, but I can toss you some more suggestions if you wanna describe what kind of shows you usually enjoy!"
coolguides,3cn7iz,waterdevil19,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:28:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, man.  Well, it's been a while, so I'll try to remember:   Saint Seiya Dragon Ball Z Evangelion Full Metal Alchemist DeathNote Paradise Kiss   I'm sure I've forgotten others, and I didn't cite any movies, but I liked: Perfect Blue, Paprika, Akira, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, Ninja Scroll, Tekkonkinkreet, Totoro, Ghost in The Shell.  There's more I'm sure, I even looked up some, but this is as far as I remember. Maybe that helps. Thank you for asking and commenting."
coolguides,3cn7iz,casualbacon,3,Thu Jul 9 20:43:48 2015 UTC,"If you liked Evangelion then I definitely think you'll enjoy Madoka Magica, and I'll also toss Mawaru Penguindrum in - it's a show that'll make you laugh out loud at the sheer absurdity of it,  but the underlying plot is incredibly dark and deeply symbolic, and the overall tone of the show seems to follow suit as it goes on (I'm about 16 of 25 episodes through it).  I can't really put my finger on why,  but it feels hugely reminiscent of Evangelion for me.   Something about the way that they tell the story and the juxtaposition of childish things done by children in a bleak and hopeless situation.  The story follows two highschool brothers whose sister is terminally ill, and on her deathbed she's possessed by a supernatural being who says it's decided to temporarily extend the girl's life, and in exchange the brothers have to find it the 'Penguindrum', telling them nothing about it except who ""probably"" has it.   If you liked Death Note then you'll probably love Code Glass, it has a lot of the same ""watching two geniuses outsmart each other"" type thing, and it's a helluva ride overall.  The same director has a new show, Knights of Sidonia, that's on Netflix and is supposed to be fantastic.  I haven't seen it, but reviews have been stellar for what it's worth!    I'd also toss in Fate/Zero and Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works in there, even though the plot isn't that similar.  Basically it follows magicians on a modern backdrop in a Battle Royale for the Holy Grail, a wish granting artifact  that only materializes once every 20ish years after a Holy Grail War,  in which each of 7 mages summons one of 7 'classes' of spirits represented by various historical and mythological figures, like King Arthur and Gilgamesh.    The order in which you watch them is a bit confusing,  and requires a bit of an explanation of the background: Fate/Stay Night was originally a 'Visual Novel',  you can think about it as a choose your own adventure book on the computer,  complete with voice acting and all.   It had 3 'paths' based on your choices: Unlimited Blade Works, Heaven's Feel, and Fate.  An anime adaptation was released that was very poorly recieved, and with good reason: it tried to combine all three routes and repeatedly descended into tropes and forced dialogue.  Later on, a different studio  came by and made Fate/Zero, a prequel to Stay Night that recieved a Huge amount of praise - it really is a fantastic show.   The same studio that made Zero is now remaking Fate/Stay Night,  following the Unlimited Blade Works route.  It's currently airing and has gotten great reviews.  In theory you're supposed to watch Fate/Stay Night UBW before Zero, but I watched Zero before UBW was out and then proceeded to watch Fate/Stay Night,  and didn't really feel like I lost much because of it except being lost at first  because they assume you've seen Stay Night.   The last thing I'm gonna recommend right now is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood.  Originally Fullmetal Alchemist was a manga,  and while it was being released they made the original anime that you watched. The problem is that the show caught up with the manga and therefore ran out of source material, so they just kinda said ""fuck it"" and made their own story.  Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood is  a remake of the anime that actually follows the manga story,  and it is the single highest-rated anime - it's truly a masterpiece.  Sorry for writing you an essay, ha!  I can give more suggestions or information if you want, and if you need a place to watch these shows shoot me a pm!  I use this awesome streaming site, but it's legally grey and I'm not sure how Reddit feels about promoting that kind of thing..."

I came in asking exactly for this, someone knowledgeable that would like to share some of that knowledge to alleviate some of my ignorance.  I think I'm starting with Madoka Magica, because it' short, so it'll be  like a stretching routine before delving deep into anime. After a couple short ones I'll go with Code Geass.

coolguides,3cfv99,BrajScience,44,Tue Jul 7 19:16:37 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. One of the ""rules"" of a logo is that it needs to convey an idea or brand as quickly as possible. When I can't interpret anything from a logo, it's not memorable."
coolguides,3cfv99,raginmund,16,Tue Jul 7 19:29:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think the concept could be any worse. At first I tried to assign the colors to ""Arti"" and ""Promotions"" so the red kind of looks like a P if you stick them together, but then the white is a backwards D with a Euro-ish sign."
coolguides,3cfv99,Cyntheon,6,Tue Jul 7 21:45:06 2015 UTC,at a first glance i could barely read the thing. i had to realize that the letters were making a OO shape.

I understand that with the exception of apple, logos typically represent a symbol or idea, as is the case with Mitsubishi and Nike. But without knowing the backstory of the brand, this means nothing. Three diamonds is simply three diamonds. I don't get anything out of that. I am willing to bet that some of the best and most memorable logos are just catchy and give no insight as to the brand itself."
coolguides,3cfv99,DeathByPetrichor,9,Wed Jul 8 02:27:21 2015 UTC,"This is why I put ""rules"" in quotation marks. Because it's sort of a guideline in the initial creation of a logo. This logo fails for more than just that reason though, allow me to explain.   They're attempting to use shapes and thin vector lines to make the word ""arti"" into a stylized format. However, typographically, it doesn't read as ""arti"" it reads as ""Orfi"" or even Drfi. Typography is everything when designing a logo using a word, and this piece is a typographical disaster. The closed bottom of the stylized A is misrepresented as an O or a D. Because of this, the logo is being misread and the company is not getting recognized. If it weren't for the fact that this composition has the company name plainly written out beneath it, I would think that Orfi made this infographic.   Furthermore, the stylization of the logo, what is it supposed to look like? A pair of glasses? Two circles? I don't immediately know what the symbol is, therefore my mind is becoming frustrated looking at it. If the logo frustrates the viewer, they will not remember it.   Finally, and this goes hand in hand with the typography, the letters have far too much curvature for them to be recognized instantaneously. Instead of going ""Oh! Cool I see it now,"" With this logo I went ""oh... I guess I see it now...?""   It's not a great logo.   As for Nike and all of the other logos you mentioned, mainly Pepsi, the company established itself to some degree before establishing its logo. Early Pepsi logos are just cursive typography of the words ""Pepsi cola"". Nike was just plain dumb luck and forced correlation.  Also the fact that it too used to have "" Nike"" written under or even within the iconic swoosh for awhile before the swoosh itself gained recognition. With this logo the company is... What? A promotional thing? Do they sell anything? Where is their logo placed besides at the footer of their papers and infographics? Not really anywhere, so I can't even get forced correlation from it.   Don't know how I can explain it any better."
coolguides,3cfv99,raginmund,17,Wed Jul 8 04:29:25 2015 UTC,Thats the first thing I noticed. Such an awful logo.
coolguides,3cfv99,Vroxilla,12,Tue Jul 7 20:12:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not only is the logo really, really bad, the name itself is horrible as well. I'm assuming this person's name is Arti. Whenever I see ""Promotions"" in a name I immediately think of a fake management company, for a wanna-be rapper, with a stereotypical logo (dollar signs, gold chains, diamonds, blunts, etc.) trying to pass themselves off as an established success. It's a very overused and abused ""business"" name."

It talks about color, but doesn't bother to mention that the best approach is to design in black/white/grey because if a logo doesn't translate without colors, it won't translate with them, either.    More than staying away from ""cliches"" I think it's more important to stay away from trends. A truly ""timeless"" logo doesn't have any particularly trendy thing going for it. For instance, remember when everything had to have a ""2.0 gloss"" to it, or for a while the big thing was stacking the letters on top of each other? Things like that quickly become dated.    Finally, I think the most important thing about logo design is to remember that your best idea is probably not your best idea. When you arrive at your best idea, come up with 10 more."

coolguides,3cblyk,DextrosKnight,1 point,Tue Jul 7 11:03:23 2015 UTC,"Trying to learn about digital photography. Just one question, why would you want to underexpose/overexpose an image instead of keeping it at 0?"
coolguides,3cblyk,AluminumGerbil,3,Tue Jul 7 07:08:01 2015 UTC,"If you're photographing landscape or anything where the sky is pictured (assuming that the sky is clear) you should expose the picture by pointing your camera at the sky. Light meter will then tell you when your picture is correctly exposed. Then you would underexpose the shot about -2 so that your picture won't be underexposed and the sky wont be overexposed either.  When photographing snow you should underexpose the shot a little, otherwise the snow could be overexposed. This all depends on your camera and it's metering."

Although Italy awarded the most renowned region of prosecco a DOGG under the name Prosecco about 3 years ago just to confuse everybody. I read somewhere that the grape varietal changed it name in 2009 (before the DOGG) but that was in the middle of the period I worked in the wine industry and the only 2 names the grape was referred to as were prosecco and balbi.

Everyone who has ever been to a party before they were legally allowed to buy alcohol has tasted that 'wine'."
coolguides,3c9xgx,Vakieh,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:17:31 2015 UTC,Cool guide.  I was shocked that Prosecco now outsells Champagne. The Ruffino Prosecco I've had is really pretty darn good for $8 bottle at HEB.

coolguides,3c46e5,Jizzipient,5,Sun Jul 5 16:17:19 2015 UTC,I always remember this because it's the same way you fold a paper football.
coolguides,3c46e5,agent_carmichael,5,Sun Jul 5 00:57:19 2015 UTC,Can i fold other flags like this or just american ? Instructions unclear
coolguides,3c46e5,Ravka90,1 point,Sun Jul 5 09:28:25 2015 UTC,"Each nation has its own customs for folding their national flag. So no, this is only for USA."
coolguides,3c46e5,buzzabuzza,4,Sun Jul 5 11:06:58 2015 UTC,Why would you ever want to fold it into a triangle? If you fold it into a square it'll probably be less puffy in the middle.
coolguides,3c46e5,aprn,5,Sat Jul 4 21:06:45 2015 UTC,"Having done this quite a few times. If done right (which it almost never is), the part that attaches to the flagpole tucks away nicely into the flag and it looks rather flattened."

coolguides,3c46e5,crod242,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:23:25 2015 UTC,You fold it to where just the stars show. To make it pretty?

coolguides,3c46e5,ICameHereToRead,2,Sun Jul 5 05:26:13 2015 UTC,Can confirm. Used to fold the flag like this everyday after school in the fifth grade. Ah the days of being a safety guard.
