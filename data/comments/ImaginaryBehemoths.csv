ImaginaryBehemoths,3b2ili,apophis-pegasus,6,Thu Jun 25 14:02:43 2015 UTC,"You know it's funny, I'd never really considered how out-of-balance the Diablo universe is with the Warcraft one.  The Nephalem are ludicrously powerful, taking out the literal embodiments of evil, not just demons from another world. If that Monk has been grinding T6 Rifts, Sargeras is in for a world of hurt.  Also, awesome picture."
ImaginaryBehemoths,3b2ili,ramblingpariah,2,Thu Jun 25 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"See, I see it the other way around with the power levels being much lower in the Diablo-verse. The difference between a ""god"" in American Gods by Neil Gaiman and a ""god"" in Greek mythology. Sargeras just entering Azeroth's dimension would be considered an apocalypse. Diablo at fully primed evilness (pun!) could still be stopped. Someone like the Lich King seems to be on Diablo's level-- and frankly that's probably being generous to Diablo."
ImaginaryBehemoths,3b2ili,nospecialhurry,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:47:44 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting take on it, but I still see Sargeras as a very powerful god-like being, whereas Diablo is a literal embodiment of a facet of evil (or the Prime Evil, depending on which Diablo we're talking) - and Sargeras was overcome by despair and fell to evil (one could almost theorize that was the first victory for Team Evil, but now I'm just being silly).   Sargeras is obviously crazy powerful, and it'd be a hell of a fight, but he is, in the end, just a (immortal, uber powerful, godlike) being in the universe, whereas Diablo is a part of the universe itself, in a sense.   That being said, a T6 D3 character vs Sargeras would still be a sweet ass fight (in my opinion, obviously)."

The last battle was a quiet one, fought in no more land than a wolf might wander in a day. It was not fought by deities, it was not even fought by warriors, but by a single, vulnerable friend.  He had fought for her before. He had fought because the whisperings of good told him she would make a difference.  Protect her, they deigned.  And though this was said to nearly a dozen, only Zal remained to fight for her. Where others had faded to the black or fallen with despair, only he had stayed at her side.  The world had come to its end. The Taer, its body emblazoned by the apathy of billions, fueled by ancient fears great and small and the nagging of death, decay, and destruction, descended towards the final light.  Zal's paws clutched the grit of earth; his tail swept the cliff's breadth. The world was ending, and his was the only body left to stop it.

ImaginaryBehemoths,2ywbqm,Luteraar,1 point,Fri Mar 13 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"Sun Wukong:       Sun Wukong, also known as the Monkey King, is a main character in the Chinese classical novel Journey to the West. Sun Wukong is also found in many later stories and adaptations. In the novel, he is a monkey born from a stone who acquires supernatural powers through Taoist practices. After rebelling against heaven and being imprisoned under a mountain by the Buddha, he later accompanies the monk Xuanzang on a journey to retrieve Buddhist sutras from India.  Sun Wukong possesses an immense amount of strength; he is able to lift his 13,500 jīn (7,960 kilograms (17,550 lb)) staff with ease. He is also extremely fast, able to travel 108,000 li (54,000 kilometres (34,000 mi)) in one somersault. Sun knows 72 transformations, which allow him to transform into various animals and objects; however, he is troubled in transforming into other forms, due to the accompanying incomplete transformation of his tail. Sun Wukong is a skilled fighter, capable of holding his own against the best warriors of heaven. Also, each of his hairs possess magical properties, capable of being transformed into clones of the Monkey King himself, and/or into various weapons, animals, and other objects. He also knows spells that can command wind, part water, conjure protective circles against demons, and freeze humans, demons, and gods alike.   One of the most enduring Chinese literary characters, Sun Wukong has a varied background and colorful cultural history. For example, Sun Wukong is considered by some scholars to be influenced by both the Hindu deity Hanuman from the Ramayana and elements of Chinese folklore.

A planet's gravitational pull increases as its mass increases and a creature that massive is going to sink into the earth if the surface its walking upon can't support it. So your choices are either sinking into the earth or being effectively immobilized by gravity. Not to mention the absurd amount of energy that would be needed to sustain a lifeform of that size.
ImaginaryBehemoths,2xvfjy,FatherSuperior7,5,Thu Mar 5 19:49:17 2015 UTC,"You made a lot of assumptions in this post. I know it doesn't mean a claim is valid. And I'm not saying you have to believe more anything like that. I'm just saying it's still possible on other planets. Because there is such variation in planets that it could happen. We don't know how they process materials to create energy. And if it doesn't exist in this universe, there may be another universe in which it does exist. But, who knows. I sure as hell don't. I'm not even certain I'm comfortable saying it does exist. I am comfortable saying it's a possibility."
ImaginaryBehemoths,2xvfjy,ChemicalKid,-2,Thu Mar 5 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"In order for these kinds of things to be possible, our understanding of physics and biology would be rendered obsolete and the reality we live in would change fundamentally. Being on another planet isn't going to change how the universe functions.  Energy isn't created by lifeforms, it is absorbed from other sources. Efficiency of energy absorption is only going to be able to do so much and won't change the fact that massive creatures would need a great deal of energy to operate.   The possibility of other fundamentally different universes in which such creatures could exist is irrelevant to the topic because the initial post explicitly said that these types of creatures do exist, which is an unsubstantiated claim that is incompatible with our understanding of how the universe works.  Finally, making assumptions isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially if they are backed with reasoning. When you get right down to it, the only thing that isn't an assumption is ""cogito ergo sum"" or ""I think, therefore, I am"" (and even that is debatable). So saying ""who knows"" is just unnecessarily muddying the waters."
ImaginaryBehemoths,2xvfjy,FatherSuperior7,3,Thu Mar 5 21:08:28 2015 UTC,"Being on another planet isn't going to change how the universe functions.   No, it's not, but you seem to forget that different levels of gravity can exist, and that there can be beings made of different materials than current life. On earth, life is carbon based. What's to say that's always the case? That being said, life could be carbon based, with a crystallized structure that lends immense strength to its limbs, allowing for much larger beings. Furthermore, combining that with a very low gravity world would allow for beings in excess of 200 feet in height quite easily. After all, we have blue whales right now because gravity is ""lower"" under water.  Energy needs are quite possible to be met. Again, look at blue whales, they survive just fine even though they're averaging 190,000 kg in weight and 30 meters in length. Given ideal conditions somewhere else, what's not to say that something twice the height couldn't survive?  Your eagerness to dismiss any ""faulty"" logic seems to be, amusingly enough, out of a disregard for logic."

They first appear in the 1965 novel Dune, considered to be among the classics in the science fiction genre, and are iconic of the Dune series.   In the series, the sandworms — called Shai-Hulud /ˈʃaɪ hʉˈluːd/   among the Fremen of the desert planet Arrakis (Dune) — are worshiped as manifestations of ""the earth deity of Fremen hearth superstitions."" The Fremen believe that the actions of the sandworms are the direct actions of God, and so the worms have been given numerous titles such as the ""Great Maker"", ""The Maker"", and the ""Worm who is God.""(God Emperor of Dune). Virtually indestructible and with indefinite lifespans of potentially thousands of years, the giant sandworms are also referred to as the ""Old Man of the Desert"", ""Old Father Eternity"" and ""Grandfather of the Desert"".  The worms may also be referred to by Fremen as Shaitan, post God-Emperor.

ImaginaryBehemoths,2c4srg,lordjimbob01,1 point,Wed Jul 30 11:41:04 2014 UTC,For some reason I'm picturing this with a word bubble that includes a dadjoke of some kind.
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,TheMalien,10,Thu Jul 24 11:13:01 2014 UTC,"By modern definitions of behemoth and leviathan, Godzilla seems to fit behemoth more.  behemoth:   a huge or monstrous creature.   leviathan:   a very large aquatic creature, especially a whale.   Since the aquatic part is arguable, labeling Godzilla as leviathan would be also arguable. So the more general term would apply, in this case behemoth.  If we go into the root meanings of the two words (which I think is what you were referring to), things get complicated because Behemoth strictly implies that Godzilla is a land beast. That being said there was also a fairly vague physical description that applied to the word which many of the submissions in here do not adhere to, since they are following the more modern definition."
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,piedoodle,3,Thu Jul 24 15:30:45 2014 UTC,I think the meaning of the words should be as used on these subs (/r/ImaginaryLeviathans and /r/ImaginaryBehemoths) regarless what the dictionary definitions are.
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,EuphemismTreadmill,5,Fri Jul 25 00:50:33 2014 UTC,He's sort of both but since he is usually shown on land I guess he would be behemoth. And if he was shown in water he would be leviathan.
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,DomRomanNoodles,5,Thu Jul 24 12:42:53 2014 UTC,"So it depends on his immediate environment, you think? Humh, might be so."
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,MindlessMindless,3,Thu Jul 24 13:26:32 2014 UTC,"Speaking as a network mod, I think that would probably be how we would handle it. Godzilla coming up out of the water would be cool for /r/ImaginaryLeviathans. Godzilla walking on land and smashing skyscrapers would fit very well here in /r/ImaginaryBehemoths."
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,Dolannsquisky,1 point,Sat Jul 26 05:56:49 2014 UTC,Agreed:)
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,Dexiro,1 point,Sat Jul 26 19:10:30 2014 UTC,I don't know. I think he's more of a leviathan. He lives at the bottom of the ocean.
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,KhanneaSuntzu,7,Thu Jul 24 15:45:46 2014 UTC,Kaiju.
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,EuphemismTreadmill,3,Thu Jul 24 22:36:05 2014 UTC,Could you say that leviathans are a type of behemoth? Or that leviathans are purely aquatic. Because if either of those are true I'd say Godzilla was a behemoth.
ImaginaryBehemoths,2bl2yj,dethb0y,4,Thu Jul 24 17:52:08 2014 UTC,"I am still unsure what he is, a Behethan or a Leviamoth."
