Animedubs,3e45cv,leftyflip86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:46 2015 UTC,Thank you good sir.
Animedubs,3e45cv,GoodSirMatthew_2,2,Tue Jul 21 23:06:14 2015 UTC,"See I could tell you a few good sites but any reference to those sites would get the comment deleted cause they're bad and illegal. Your best bet is to wait till the end of the week to look for it again, it usually doesn't take long for dubs to appear online after their DVD release. So be patient young padawan :P"
Animedubs,3e45cv,0mfgroflmao,2,Tue Jul 21 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"Ahh me sees wink Not what I was looking for but yes I am sure those ""sites"" will have them eventually."
Animedubs,3e20g0,proznac,13,Tue Jul 21 10:06:40 2015 UTC,Where on earth is the Steins Gate movie dub?   In a different timeline. ;-;
Animedubs,3e20g0,TwistedBOLT,5,Tue Jul 21 10:35:48 2015 UTC,"We need to reach 1% divergence, and even then we don't know if the new attractor field will have the movie..."
Animedubs,3e20g0,pickelsurprise,2,Tue Jul 21 15:19:28 2015 UTC,"http://www.funimation.com/blog/2014/08/09/home-video-announcements-from-otakon/  Pretty much everything from that section of the announcement didn't happen. The re-release of Haruhi and Lucky Star are huge too. Those box sets from the previous release are stupid expensive right now. It seems they aren't even planning to dub the Strike Witches movie, and I don't think that's been released in any way even in its subtitled form either.   These are all licensed from Kadokawa, so I wonder if they screwed up something in the contract for this batch or something.   Alternatively, the Broadcast dubs have proven to be overwhelming for them."
Animedubs,3e1d0q,qodzero,7,Tue Jul 21 05:10:20 2015 UTC,The blu-ray only just came out in Japan about a week ago and there aren't even fansubs yet so I wouldn't expect a dub for 6 months to a year from now. And as Funimation dub everything and the first 2 seasons are already dubbed it's a 99.9% chance this will get dubbed too.
Animedubs,3e1d0q,0mfgroflmao,6,Tue Jul 21 07:01:01 2015 UTC,Still waiting on the Steins;Gate Movie to be dubbed...
Animedubs,3e1d0q,LeSpanishRice,4,Tue Jul 21 07:43:18 2015 UTC,Steins;Gate has a MOVIE? I am now upset it's not dubbed.
Animedubs,3e1d0q,Nikolai_Roze,2,Tue Jul 21 09:37:00 2015 UTC,Most likely.
Animedubs,3e1d0q,shwag945,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:34:27 2015 UTC,why can't they hurry this bitch up?
Animedubs,3e1d0q,TwistedVivid,4,Tue Jul 21 05:39:27 2015 UTC,The subs aren't even out yet and neither is season 2's bluray. The movie will only be released once it is ready to ship on bluray so it might be like a year. Maybe more.
Animedubs,3e1d0q,shwag945,4,Tue Jul 21 05:44:49 2015 UTC,You also have to keep in mind Funimation is doing simuldubs which take a lot of time from dubbing older shows and they basically dub almost everything they get so it may be a while
Animedubs,3e1d0q,superange128,2,Tue Jul 21 05:58:37 2015 UTC,I hope so. The series have been very fun to watch so far.
Animedubs,3e1d0q,WinterFresh04,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:42:06 2015 UTC,"The most we know is that they have the rights to it but other than that, nothing. Hopefully with the film being out on DVD/Blu-Ray in Japan, we might get an announcement soon."
Animedubs,3e0r9u,huzaifa96,3,Tue Jul 21 01:55:03 2015 UTC,It's coming but been delayed until September
Animedubs,3e0r9u,0mfgroflmao,2,Tue Jul 21 01:59:16 2015 UTC,"The situation regarding the Jojo's dub's a bit weird. For starters the big announcement regarding a dub came from a release listing for the DVD, and the only place to have first seen and heard the dub was at the Anime Expo panel earlier this month, where only a handful of cast members were confirmed.  Not only that but Warner Bros is handling the home video release rather than Viz Media (as many thought since they licenced the merchandising rights for the anime), and we're all pretty much theorizing that they're handling the show to help with the copyright and band name issues.   It was originally meant to be out on DVD this month but got delayed till September for some unknown reason."
Animedubs,3e0r9u,JRPictures,3,Tue Jul 21 02:18:46 2015 UTC,"It is commendable that the copyright issues are being handled so well by Warner Bros, I'm presuming they have a studio in the LA area. What is the studio name? Is it B!Z! Or Studiopolis? Also...Blu-Ray?"
Animedubs,3e0r9u,JRPictures,3,Tue Jul 21 03:07:14 2015 UTC,"It looks like Bang Zoom so far, based off most of the actor's credentials and the ADR director's work. And so far there has been no Blu-Ray release confirmed so far unfortunately."
Animedubs,3dzdlu,Auriellric,2,Mon Jul 20 19:36:53 2015 UTC,"I don't think you will find a place where Eu's notes are translated in English in Season 2, stream-wise. Blame FUNimation for that little mishap. I suppose you could try pirating it and then adding fan subs to it.  I watched the second season without the English notes and it didn't really bother me that much. I kind of imagined what she would say Ayumu-style. :D"
Animedubs,3dzdlu,WinterFresh04,4,Tue Jul 21 10:51:49 2015 UTC,You mean Is this a zombie? I watched it on funimation.com and pretty sure all the notepads are translated otherwise you wouldn't know what she was saying!

Animedubs,3dzdlu,0mfgroflmao,4,Mon Jul 20 20:19:56 2015 UTC,"Oh didn't realize the second season had ""of the dead"" tagged on the end.  But funimation have both seasons dubbed on their site (incl OVAs) and I don't remember having issues with subs on Hellscythe's notepads."
Animedubs,3dzdlu,Xhynk,3,Mon Jul 20 20:27:57 2015 UTC,"To couple this, their apps have everything on them too (the Xbox One app just go released a few days ago [Freaking FINALLY!])"
Animedubs,3dzdlu,0mfgroflmao,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:41 2015 UTC,"I use Funimation only through the Roku app and it's pretty good, could use a few improvements though like keeping track of where you are in a series like crunchyroll's app."
Animedubs,3dzdlu,Xhynk,2,Mon Jul 20 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"The X1 funimation app keeps track of all that for you. I wonder if you could prod support about adding it to Roku. It's great, just boot up the Xbox, load Funimation, and click on any show you've watched and it takes you to the time and place you last watched it."

Animedubs,3dzdlu,0mfgroflmao,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:40:19 2015 UTC,"All prices are here, the all-access is $7.95/month but cheaper if you go for 3 or 12 months."

Animedubs,3dw96j,TwistedBOLT,5,Mon Jul 20 09:24:52 2015 UTC,Apparently Sentai dubbed the movie as an experiment in seeing if it would sell well enough for them to consider dubbing the show. I don't know it's worked or not but it has been some time.
Animedubs,3dw96j,JRPictures,5,Mon Jul 20 02:53:38 2015 UTC,"For the most part I believe the dub was well received,however it would take way too much money,than what they have available ,to take on a show of this size."

Animedubs,3dwa6r,The-Sublimer-One,2,Mon Jul 20 02:03:11 2015 UTC,"Another is basically the anime version of Final Destination. It's a pretty fun ride, but by the end of it (the last two episodes especially) you may be rooting for some characters to get axed off."
Animedubs,3dwa6r,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:01:00 2015 UTC,If you look at it as a mystery/detective story it's shit because of the end. But if you just stick around for the blood with your brain off it's pretty fun.
Animedubs,3dwa6r,LunchTrey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:19:16 2015 UTC,"Important to point out that the reason to watch Clannad is so you can get to Clannad After Story. I mean, Clannad is fine, but After Story is great."
Animedubs,3dwa6r,Venom45528,4,Wed Jul 22 05:55:16 2015 UTC,"You haven't seen some of my favorites yet, you're in for a treat. For mystery, Monster is incredible. It's kinda long, but every episode is great. For a fantasy show, A Certain Magical Index. Freezing and Highschool DxD are great action animes in a school setting, also DxD is hilarious. My favorite of all time is From the New World. It takes a while to build up, but it pays off big time. These are also all dubbed."
Animedubs,3dwa6r,Venom45528,3,Mon Jul 20 02:02:42 2015 UTC,"I've seen Magical index and DxD, I've read up on Monster and it has caught my attention. Ill take a look at From The New World, thanks for your suggestions!"
Animedubs,3dwa6r,TwistedBOLT,2,Mon Jul 20 02:05:24 2015 UTC,"Also for horror, Another is pretty good. I've also been watching Ghost Hound recently, and it's looking pretty promising."

Animedubs,3dtngu,superange128,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:38:55 2015 UTC,"But in this scenario, there would be no previously established cast.  In this specific series, this question works very well, as the FUNimation dub of DB was based on the Latin American dub, as in 1996, Toei had thrown out all their old tapes of Dragon Ball by then.  This is noticeable in the older dubs, as the voices of the Harmony Gold dub and to a lesser extent, the 1995 part 1 dub, sound much closer to the original actors, who of course were familiar with the source material.  Of course, the Texas cast has improved tons, and is relatively a decent cast, but they are all miscasts in the first place, especially as poor and short of actors as FUNimation was back in 1998-2000"
Animedubs,3dtngu,superange128,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:30:42 2015 UTC,Oh.  Well Im no good with what ifs if theres already a dub that I already like.  Something that could get redubbed like Cardcaptor Sakura would be fun for me

Animedubs,3dol66,Chamaeleontis,3,Fri Jul 17 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"I watch a lot of yuri subbed so there are likely some more dubs that I am skipping. Also, not all of them have kissing/dating and are instead ""subtext."" Though the yuri is clear enough in all of them. The more romance centric yuri anime are all subbed unfortunately.  Blue Drop  Kannazuki no Miko  Noir  El Cazador de la Bruja  Madlax  Canaan  Kurau Phantom Memory  Revolutionary Girl Utena"
Animedubs,3dol66,Chamaeleontis,2,Sat Jul 18 00:34:54 2015 UTC,Thanks a bunch. I wonder if they aren't dubbed because of the content? Which I think would be a stupid reason. It's anime. I expect the following:  1)Kissing  2)Lewdness/Nudity  3)Violence/Blood
Animedubs,3dn5hj,LordLightning,6,Fri Jul 17 17:00:42 2015 UTC,"B Gata H Kei is a great one. (Though the last episode does have boobage, if that's not your thing.)  EDIT: I just remembered that Haganai is full of exposed breasts, so I don't know what I was thinking.  School Rumble is another one that has what you're looking for.  Space Dandy is probably one of the funniest shows I've watched in a long time, and there are some good romance episodes in there.  Is This a Zombie? It currently has two seasons and two OVAs.  Azumanga Daioh is the series that got me back into anime, and is absolutely hilarious.  Similarly, Pani Poni Dash is like Azumanga Daioh if all the writers were on shrooms. Still hilarious.  A Certain Magical Index and its spin-off, A Certain Scientific Railgun, both have some great humor interspersed with some kick-ass action.  Mirai Nikki can be humorous, but a fair warning. It can get really dark at points. Also the post-series OVA is only subbed at the moment, sadly."
Animedubs,3dn5hj,The-Sublimer-One,2,Fri Jul 17 17:05:29 2015 UTC,"I've actually already watched School Rumble. I have Azumanga Daioh and Space Dandy on my personal to-watch list, though I'm slightly apprehensive about Space Dandy since it seems similar to Cowboy Bebop to me and I wasn't really a huge fan of that."
Animedubs,3dn5hj,The-Sublimer-One,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:30 2015 UTC,"Pretty much the only similarities Space Dandy shares with Bebop is that it's episodic and the currency used is Woolongs. There are a few references to the show, but overall it's entirely its own thing."

Even if it was anime original I wish I kept going! Same for The Devil is a Part Timer, where's my season 2 of that?!?"
Animedubs,3dn5hj,The-Sublimer-One,3,Sun Jul 19 13:01:45 2015 UTC,Or Baccano?

There's actually a rewatch starting tomorrow on the main sub, which would be a great way to watch it for the first time. Even if you wouldn't prefer doing that, I still highly recommend watching it at some point. It's probably the best dub for anything I've ever heard."
Animedubs,3dn5hj,jdimaria3,2,Sun Jul 19 13:20:18 2015 UTC,"Oh awesome, I had no idea about the rewatch! I'll have to hop on that for sure (if I can keep myself to episodes a day since I normally binge watch), thanks for letting me know. Better than TTGL, B Gata H Kei and The Devil is a Part-Timer? That's pretty damn impressive haha!"
Animedubs,3dn5hj,The-Sublimer-One,2,Sun Jul 19 13:50:17 2015 UTC,"I know, right? After hearing those dubs, it's hard to believe there could be something better. But that's just another one of the things that makes Baccano amazing."
Animedubs,3dn5hj,jdimaria3,2,Sun Jul 19 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"I'll take your word for it! If I don't end up doing the rewatch it, I'll definitely binge it at some point soon (making it a priority, along with Steins;Gate). Thanks for the recommendation!"

Animedubs,3dnbs2,notorious2122,2,Sat Jul 18 07:17:20 2015 UTC,"Didn't really watch the whole dub (since I wanted to stay consistent with S2 and the OVAs which were only in Japanese), but I skimmed through each episode.  It's an alright sounding dub but the actors (who have all sounded great in other roles) feel poorly directed and there's a few script choices that don't go over too well (Satoko still calling her brother 'Nii-Nii' in the dub wasn't the best choice but I can understand how they couldn't find a suitable replacement for it)  Still I wouldn't object to rewatching the series dubbed if Sentai Filmworks dubs the rest of the seasons with the same cast, hopefully."
Animedubs,3dnbs2,notorious2122,2,Sat Jul 18 08:28:42 2015 UTC,"I was soo bored of this show, got like 6 episodes in. Heard the second season makes it a lot better. Maybe I'll try to revisit one day."
Animedubs,3dnbs2,superange128,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:47:22 2015 UTC,"In season 1, it doesn't explain what the hell is going on, and it leaves people confused, and bored. So, the second season does indeed make it better since it tells you why everything is happening the way it is."

Animedubs,3dglx0,Crazyripps,3,Thu Jul 16 05:16:21 2015 UTC,I haven't seen the anime but read the manga  manga series 1 spoilers Basically i am not worried about her since she is a supporting character.   First trailer I have actually watched for the anime version. I don't think the animation fits the manga too well. we will see. Also for the second season it is not supposed to be related to the manga pretty much. I also doubt TG :re will be adapted because it would make no sense to adapt it without the anime and manga ending matching up perfectly. So expect an anime original s3 if there is one.
Animedubs,3dglx0,shwag945,3,Thu Jul 16 07:30:59 2015 UTC,Yeah I've seen both seasons subbed but I mean it's just not the voice I would give her. I know she doesn't show up that much in the first & second season but still

I personally think it's stupid when others claim the only way to truly enjoy an anime is by watching the sub.. that's simply not true, but so many closed minded people will ignore any and all reason."
Animedubs,3d741k,xProtoZoax,7,Tue Jul 14 04:14:03 2015 UTC,That's why I always tell the haters that they should judge an anime's dub on its own merits rather than by comparing it to the sub and automatically saying it's shit.

Animedubs,3d741k,GoodSirMatthew_2,6,Tue Jul 14 08:35:29 2015 UTC,"Most of my thoughts on the subject can be found here.  I only watch anime in subs, but I only watch anime in the first place because of dubs. I think it's fine to compare the two and conclude for a show that a sub or dub gives you a 'better' experience, but I also think the dub of many shows should be encouraged to someone who prefers things in English. Each has their place in the anime community.  A lot of anime fans just prefer hearing Japanese characters sound Japanese, hence why we get erroneous statements like 'all dubs suck'. Some however don't connect to a language they're unfamiliar with, and will likewise erroneously advocate that all non-Japanese people should watch dubs. The best place is a middle ground where you can respect both and choose either based on your preferences."
Animedubs,3d741k,JekoJeko5,4,Tue Jul 14 12:30:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. For some series I actually prefer the dub, but those series are often shows where the main cast isn't little girl characters. Spice and Wolf I highly prefer the dub cast but something like Madoka I'm a bigger fan of the original voices simply because I'm not a fan of the way english casts do 'high pitched little girl' to match the personality of the characters.   I approach dubs on a case-by-case basis."
Animedubs,3d741k,dreamendDischarger,7,Tue Jul 14 17:52:24 2015 UTC,well... i watched dub mainly because im too lazy to read.... i like to just sit down and relax while watching my shows... i dont even use subs when watching movies either... but if a show is actually good and worth my time.... i might just watched it subs such as love live and mikakunin..... :)
Animedubs,3d741k,Blackpiece,3,Tue Jul 14 20:26:08 2015 UTC,People generally know English and don't know Japanese so they are able to find faults in the sub but if there's a mistake in the sub they just write it off as a translation error. This pisses me off more than it should.

I love when I show them a good dub and you can read on their face that they are enjoying it but they still pull out some bullshit reason why they don't want to watch them. Usually it's something along the linea of ""it doesn't feel right"" or ""it's not the original"" or ""it's not how the writer intended"" aka bure bullshit."

Animedubs,3d4v6l,You_Stealthy_Bastard,13,Mon Jul 13 15:45:15 2015 UTC,"Zero. My primary argument in favor of dubs is that word emphasis is important for understanding subtle nuances of meaning. Since Japanese grammar/sentence structure is so different from English, and because subs almost never use bold or italics for some reason, it's really easy to miss things like sarcasm. My friends claim they know enough Japanese words to get the gist of it. And the reason I know they're all lying sacks of crap is that they easily get bored of dialog-heavy shows without a lot of action."

In all seriousness though, i feel like a lot of the effect is lost when i can't speak the language. word emphasis and choice of wording is important, and understanding wordplay and accents makes for much better characterization in animation then being forced to assume by way of reading. to all the elitists that say subs are the ""right"" way, then i just tell them they are going out of their way to absorb a series in an ineffectual and sometimes ""missing"" format due to the lack of real understanding of their subtle speech quirks."

I searched Google Videos for it...to find ""Episode --- English subbed"". Oh, it's in Japanese. This isn't fun. And gave up on the show. Something 90% of modern kids would find astonishingly horrifying lol.  Anyhow, I grew up on 4Kids!' Pokemon and later Yugi-O and they are as American to me as the Pakistani flag...so I had much trouble considering the pill of Japanese-language material, even though intellectually I understood due to copyright statements, the origin of the shows. I definitely was into reading ""free"" manga, especially un-localized stuff...but anyhow, in more recent times, I have become much less opposed to learning more about ""original"" versions of the shows I was into, and am pleased to learn that many of the dubs I was into are fantastic representations of the Japanese-language production.  So that's my story of Japanese-language anime. Thanks for listening.  And for the answer to the question, I have 2 friends who are interested in this stuff. One is a dyed-in-the-wool ""sub"" fans, one is slightly more casual, and half-and-half. And another much more casual fan who I wouldn't talk to on the subject, definitely a dubbie.

There is always going to be something lost between languages and I would rather have the dialogues tweaked so that it resonates in my language than a literal sub any day.

Animedubs,3d3oz0,0mfgroflmao,3,Tue Jul 14 02:21:21 2015 UTC,"Ok so I've got an update on the status of this series' dub. I tried to buy it from RightStuf, but the item is still unavailable, so I guess the dub release date was wrong? I don't really know, but I'm a bit disappointed."
Animedubs,3d3oz0,TweetsInCommentsBot,3,Sat Jul 18 18:26:28 2015 UTC,"Also, the dub has been unavailable for at least a week or more now."
Animedubs,3d31g0,0mfgroflmao,4,Mon Jul 13 03:08:32 2015 UTC,I am afraid it is yet to have a dub. Although Tamako Market has got a dub which took over a year to be released so I would say it is still possible for the movie to get a dub.  Deciding if you wanna hold out and wait longer to see if maybe there is any news say by the end of the year or watching it subbed is totally up to you and whether you mind waiting longer before watching it.

Since you like Baccano you can check out Durarara, both are written by the same guy.   Darker than Black is in the same vein of this shows as well. I would skip the second season and OVA's though.   Black Lagoon is awesome as well. Very action movie like."
Animedubs,3csfoz,The-Sublimer-One,2,Sat Jul 11 12:38:10 2015 UTC,"I recommend watching the original FMA first, then Brotherhood. The original, while not as good, provides a nice amount of character depth that Brotherhood skims past, most likely because the creators assumed people had already watched the original."

Haven't posted on here in like a month, so there will be some stuff from a few weeks ago listed.   Ninja Slayer: Watched 3 episodes of this and it is absolutely balls. Thank god the episodes are only 15 minutes. Studio Trigger is so over hyped. Like the opening song though.   Ben-To: I have no idea why I watched all of this. Bad.  Rolling Girls: I've been trying to finish this forever but it is such a chore. On episode 8. Its at least colorful.  Ping-Pong the Animation: Probably the best thing I've watched all year. Not the prettiest, but the art is interesting. Really liked the dub as well.   Nagato Yuki-Chan: Man this is such a guilty pleasure. Sooo corny, but I look forward to it every week. I've heard it gets more serious later on. Dub is fantastic of course.   Noragami: Great! New season in the fall, can't wait.   Otaku Teacher: I've finished 4 episodes and I can't take it no more. God Awful.   BlazBlue: I thought this was pretty good. Plot was meh but characters were likable except for Taka....her existence baffles me. Has got me back into the video games."

Animedubs,3ccee5,The-Sublimer-One,20,Mon Jul 6 20:37:21 2015 UTC,"Kyle, when screenwriting for a western audience, do you feel it's better to put more focus into exact translation (Exmple from K-On) or looser translation with more entertainment value (Example from D-Frag)?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,12,Mon Jul 6 22:57:01 2015 UTC,"Depends on the show/scene. I think that K-On scene obviously works better in the sub, because man, that would be hard to write around.  I personally like straying aware for entertainment value when it makes sense. We're dubbing with the North Western hemisphere in mind, so I think we can change things with that in mind."
Animedubs,3ccee5,The-Sublimer-One,2,Tue Jul 14 00:14:12 2015 UTC,Thank you!
Animedubs,3ccee5,Dawnstar9075,2,Tue Jul 14 00:57:36 2015 UTC,I think the D-frag example is ironic and funny because that's dialogue for an english dub of an anime
Animedubs,3ccee5,kingdomofdoom,15,Wed Jul 15 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"Hi Kyle, thanks for doing this AMA!  What's the interaction with the Japanese companies usually like during preproduction? Do they want to aprove scripts and have strict guidelines when it comes to how the English dub should be? Or is it more ""here are the videofiles without all the dialogue, knock yourself out"" sort of thing?  A bit of a tec nerd so I always like to ask this:  What sort of software do you use at funimation for dubbing and editing?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,11,Mon Jul 6 20:54:45 2015 UTC,"No problem!  Depends on the caliber of the show. One Piece had a lot of pre-approval from the Japanese. They gave the final say on casting and want us to stick pretty close to translation. It's relaxed a bit since it came off the air, but that's the biggest example I can think of. Generally, though, we have a decent amount of freedom aside from key terms we can't really change.  Pro Tools. I think our video department uses Final Cut. We're almost exclusively Apple products in production, if not company-wide."
Animedubs,3ccee5,Irongarden3,12,Tue Jul 14 00:09:47 2015 UTC,"Hello Mr. Phillips, I was wondering how different simuldubs are from just the regular process of dubbing a show after it has completely aired in Japan? Also do you believe that a simuldub is going to become the new standard for a lot of animes in the near future?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,9,Wed Jul 8 03:23:29 2015 UTC,"Hello! The biggest difference is deadlines. Generally, DVD dubs are 6 episodes dubbed in a month or two, while broadcast dub episodes are start and finished in one week. I think it will be the new standard for at least the high caliber premiering japanese shows."
Animedubs,3ccee5,putemonsteret,11,Tue Jul 14 00:52:36 2015 UTC,"Hey Kyle.   Whos the favorite voice actor that you've worked with and why? What is your opinion on deviating from the source material and altering the dialogue of the dub away from the  original japanese source material to something entirely new and original to the dub? Did you do this a lot in Ultimate Oraku Teacher? I havn't seen it (altough I will probably check it out now). But you mentioned that the sub ad left a bad impression that you wanted to rectify. How did you go about doing that?   Also I don't know if this is something you have insight on, but it's something I've been wondering:   Most dubs are curently restricted to NA, leaving people outside of this zone to no other choice but to pirate if they want to watch dubbed anime. Netflix has made some progress here with their Knights of Sidonia dub (which is the only anime they have that is available world wide).  Do you see any change to this in sight? Have funimation ever considered going international as far as you are aware?   Thanks for doing this AMA!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,8,Tue Jul 7 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"Hello!   Just one?! They're all great (mostly). Todd Haberkorn and I are really good friends and always have good time when recording. Cole Brown is a lesser known guy that I wish was in all the time. He's always fun to work with and has one of my favorite voices. Also, Mallorie Rodak, Bryan Massey, Tia Ballard. Sabat. EVERYONE. Kinda answered this earlier. I love doing that when it makes sense. I personally think UOT is a love letter to the otaku out there, so we try to squeeze in as many anime/game/manga references as possible without going overboard. The Ninja Slayer reference we did in ep 06 is my favorite so far! The vocal minority seemed to drop the show because of the animation. I'm hoping that our dub will help you ignore the animation. Also, we treat the bad animation instances like Skyrim glitches; we love them! I honestly don't have any insight into this. I assume that's something we're working toward. Who knows what kind of legal loopholes you have to jump through, though.    Thanks for the question!"

Animedubs,3ccee5,subtlepaw,10,Tue Jul 14 00:33:46 2015 UTC,"Hi Kyle!  What unlicensed classic would you love to get the chance to adapt and dub?   People say that adapting shows that rely heavy on japanese wordplay and language quirks (like for example Bakemonogatari) is impossible and shouldn't be attempted. What's your take on this? And if you don't think it impossible, how would you aproach a dub like that?  Also would you take the challange and dub Bakemonogatari given the opurtunity?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,5,Tue Jul 7 21:12:20 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Not sure about unlicensed... I would've loved to dub Cowboy Bebop. Also, I'm a huge fan of Bayonetta, so I would've liked to have dubbed that (we did it out of house because of the cast).  I'm not familiar with Bakemonogatari, but I think most anything can be dubbed. It would require working with the Japanese licensor and them being okay with us writing around/eliminating the japanese wordplay. If it's very, very visual, though, then maybe not.   I would totally take the challenge!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,wolfflame21,4,Tue Jul 14 00:38:34 2015 UTC,Watch Bakemonogatari then get back to us...seems like a nightmare.
Animedubs,3ccee5,Billy-Orcinus,9,Tue Jul 14 02:49:15 2015 UTC,"Hello Kyle,   I just wanted to start off by saying thanks for doing this AMA and that I think FUNimation dubbing is absolutely amazing! I enjoy it so much that for shows like Fairy Tail, I only watch the dubbed version.  My first question is, how is the determination made in regards to what to keep from the Japanese version of the show when adapting it for Western audiences, specifically cultural elements? In other words, what is the process for determining what to change and what to maintain when dubbing a show?   Secondly, what are some of your favourite animes?  Thanks"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,9,Wed Jul 8 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Good to hear! Thank you!  Depends on the show. For something like Kamisama Kiss, we're going to want to keep most of the japanese culture in there. Something like Desert Punk? We have more leeway. It really depends on the writer/director. If it'd be appropriate and funny to stray away from translation, we probably will. We'd never just do something completely different just for gits and shiggles.   One Piece (if anything has pirates in it, I'm going to love it. Check out Black Sails on Starz), Cowboy Bebop, Vampire Hunter D, ULTIMATE OTAKU TEACHER. Toriko and Shangri-La is are very underrated anime that I worked on."
Animedubs,3ccee5,Billy-Orcinus,3,Tue Jul 14 01:22:09 2015 UTC,"gits and shiggles.   Yeah, I gotta remember this one. Hope you don't mind me using it in the future because it's just so unique and funny!  Also I just recently finished Cowboy Bebop and I must say it was excellent. That series absolutely deserves all the praise it gets. I especially enjoyed the music, which was no surprise to me as Yoko Kanno always does a brilliant job. In fact, she also did the music for Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, which is one of my favourite anime series.   Thank you for answering my questions, I really enjoyed reading your responses."
Animedubs,3ccee5,AstonishingSpiderMan,8,Tue Jul 14 02:17:19 2015 UTC,"Hi Kyle,  Are there any plans for the OVA of Fairytail to be released via FUNimation?  Why was the dubbed version of Fairytail delayed?  Why do the dubs in general take so long to come out?!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,8,Wed Jul 8 18:45:00 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Tyler really wants to dub those OVAs but we haven't heard anything.   They took a year off, so we took some time off. I think we'll eventually catch up. Some day.  The process can be quite long! Also, sometimes the licensors drag their feet on materials. We're pretty in-house on everything, while in Japan almost every aspect of doing an anime is done by a different company. It can be challenging to coordinate with them in a timely manner."
Animedubs,3ccee5,JeremyMcDev,5,Tue Jul 14 01:24:13 2015 UTC,It would be great to see the OVA's come out.
Animedubs,3ccee5,The-Sublimer-One,5,Tue Jul 14 01:26:01 2015 UTC,"Are there any plans for the OVA of Fairytail to be released via FUNimation?   And the OVA of Future Diary. It provides a lot of closure for the series, and it's pretty jarring having to go from the main series dubbed to the OVA subbed."
Animedubs,3ccee5,Theskian,10,Sat Jul 11 04:14:08 2015 UTC,"Hey Kyle!  So like, how does one even get into doing Voice Acting? It's not something I've ever thought about doing myself, but I've always wondered. Is it similar to an actor with agents? How does one look for the advertisements? What does the interview process incur?  For a cheeky second question, what is Colleen Clinkenbeard like? Erza and Gohan (Mostly Teen) are my favourite characters ever, and I always get a little excited when I hear her in an anime. She is probably my favourite VA too.  Thanks in advance! Have a good day!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,5,Tue Jul 7 09:17:17 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Most of our voice actors have agents. I think most people start off in theater. Voice acting is just one skill of an actor. Hardly anyone is just a voice actor. You can submit a demo to a voice agent and then they get you work, or honestly, just know someone who would recommend you and get you in the door. The ""interview process"" is just an audition. We don't have any employeed actors; they're all independent contractors (aside from the ones who have full-time positions as well).   She's really cool, smart, funny and obviously really good at voice acting. She's very professional and has high standards (not in a bad way), so she can be pretty intimidating as a director, and is quite infamous among the engineers. We like to throw the new guys at her because we're awesome.  Also, Colleen doesn't like farts."
Animedubs,3ccee5,Theskian,4,Tue Jul 14 00:24:46 2015 UTC,Thank you!  Glad she is such a cool person! :D
Animedubs,3ccee5,miranasaurus,3,Tue Jul 14 00:40:53 2015 UTC,"Also, Colleen doesn't like farts   Classic Colleen"
Animedubs,3ccee5,Syndromic,9,Tue Jul 14 02:27:36 2015 UTC,"Hi Kyle, thanks for the AMA. Normally how long does it take to adapt the script from Japanese to English? And is it usually done by 2 people or depend on the anime's genre? Is there circumstance where the voice actors have to ad-lib?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,8,Wed Jul 8 03:59:55 2015 UTC,"Hello, no problem! For broadcast dubs, when we get the translation in (no idea how long that takes), it takes about 2-3 weeks. For DVD dubs, we usually have a bit more time. The physical act of writing a script takes about 2-4 hours for ADR prep (time coding) and 20 hours for adapting the script. Then, it goes through lead writer review, corrections, and then finally head writer review. Depends on the deadline, actually. When we had 3-4 booths recording One Piece, it was all hands on deck (ha!) for the writers. For broadcast dubs, it's generally a lead writer who writes and another writer under them. World Break had just one writer.  Sometimes the actors do, and when they do it's a combined effort with the director to come up with something. We always do some fine adjusting here and there when we're in the booth if we come up with something funny or different that we like."
Animedubs,3ccee5,zSoulweaver,10,Tue Jul 14 00:59:27 2015 UTC,"Hi there, I would like to know what is stopping companies like Funimation from working with the Japanese studio before release to be able to dub a show that will release side by side with the subbed release? Is it to do with communication, money or even you'd like to see how well the show does before starting a project?  Another question I have, which I guess is kinda related the my last, is how does Funi chooses the shows they want to dub. Whether it be for simuldub or a dub after the show has aired. Cause with new shows that come out with simuldub you wouldn't know how well they would do in the community unless the maybe the manga got good praise.  Thanks for your time and effort aswell!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,7,Wed Jul 8 05:25:29 2015 UTC,"Hello! I think seeing how well the show does is probably the biggest reason why there's a delay. I think the standard format will eventually be when it airs in Japan, we have it dubbed and available 3-4 weeks later. I think we'll see more like Space Dandy where it comes out at the same time, but this is still pretty new to us and coordinating all the materials in time is quite tasking.  With whether to dub or not, it's a combination of buzz, proven studios, and manga popularity. For just simulcasts, it's if the price is right!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,JoeyJojos_Wacky_Trip,10,Tue Jul 14 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks for doing an AMA Kyle,  How fun was Ninja Slayer? Must've been an easy job considering all the Aaaargh!'s and Yeeart!'s :P"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,10,Wed Jul 8 20:10:49 2015 UTC,"No problem!  How fun is Ninja Slayer? TONS. We get to break a lot of our dubbing rules with it. ""That read was terrible? Great!"" ""Cast the same guy as multiple people in the same ep? Sure!"" We love Ninja Slayer. A lot."
Animedubs,3ccee5,SuperSaiyanPan,8,Tue Jul 14 01:25:42 2015 UTC,"Hi Kyle, I was wondering if you can give us any bit of news on Dragon Ball Super being dubbed? Is it even being passed around as a joke?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,4,Tue Jul 7 05:44:30 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately I can't. We obviously would love to dub it, and I would be surprised if another company did."
Animedubs,3ccee5,SuperSaiyanPan,2,Tue Jul 14 00:16:05 2015 UTC,Thanks for your reply. I don't expect a second reply so now it's more of a vent.  This series will supposedly have 100+ episodes. I bet we don't get a dub until it's all over. And just like the new movies it will all be spoiled because in the time it takes to wait people ruin it for us who appreciate the dubs. I really hope you guys dub this.
Animedubs,3ccee5,flappy_pipe,8,Tue Jul 14 02:20:28 2015 UTC,"Hey Kyle. Broadcast dubbing aside, what do you think about the current climate of the dubbing industry, in regard to where it's going, and how does Funi intend to spread the popularity of dubs?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,6,Tue Jul 7 22:05:57 2015 UTC,"Hello! I think us starting the broadcast dub initiative will push other companies to do something similar, so faster dubs! I'd like to see more dynamic casts instead of just throwing the usual suspects in familiar roles (hence how I cast UOT). We're bringing on some new marketing people with new ideas, but spreading the word of our streaming service is our big thing right now. SUBSCRIBE!!!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,MrReynevan2,8,Tue Jul 14 00:42:02 2015 UTC,"Hi Kyle!   Is FUNimation planning to release their products/allow subscription worldwide? Do you have any information on that matter? It would be awesome to watch dubs freely on FUNI's website. I don't mind paying a few dollars for the subscription, as I'm doing the same for music streaming and it's working perfectly for me. It's just that with anime I have no such option. What determines whether or not an anime gets"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,5,Wed Jul 8 00:37:08 2015 UTC,"Hello!   I kinda answered that earlier. Unfortunately I don't really have any info on that. How would we make money if we give away our dubs for free? You can watch older dubbed/subbed stuff with ads on our site.  ...whether or not gets dubbed? Justin Cook has some secret logarithm that determines if something gets broadcast dubbed and a physical release, just broadcast dubbed, or just a sub release."
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,3,Tue Jul 14 00:48:24 2015 UTC,Now it works?!
Animedubs,3ccee5,The-Sublimer-One,2,Tue Jul 14 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"Ha. Yeah, you have to put a space after the asterisk."
Animedubs,3ccee5,GanahaMode,6,Tue Jul 14 00:58:39 2015 UTC,Hello Kyle. Might I ask why it is so difficult to get an audition with you guys? I've spoken to Tara and requested to be put on the waiting list multiple times and I haven't heard anything in over a year and a half at the least. Did I miss a change in the process somewhere or was it just a but if bad luck that cause my emails to go overlooked? Thanks in advance!
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,7,Wed Jul 8 05:28:41 2015 UTC,"Hello! Our waiting list is quite, quite long. We generally work with only agented actors, but we occasionally bring in fresh meat with recommendations. We do open auditions every once in a while to comb through the unproven actors. If you're not local, it's really, really hard to get in. If you're local, knowing what you sound like ahead of time is helpful. Sending in a demo reel is never a bad idea.  Also, Tara is the busiest person in the entire world."
Animedubs,3ccee5,Vincen44,8,Tue Jul 14 01:11:09 2015 UTC,"Hi there Kyle, thanks for doing this. Few questions about the FairyTail dub.   Is there any benefit to releasing the dubs in chunks as opposed to on a weekly basis? Or is that a consequence of it not airing on a tv network in the states? Will there be any changes in procedure with the translations of the 2014 series? I know the dub is supposed to appeal to a younger audience but I'd really like to see some more vulgarity and profanity from the show.  Can we expect regular installments of the dubs for now on after the august release? Or do you see more turbulence as the dub moves forward? Could you possibly comment on these past/future delays ?   Thanks again, any response will be Appreciated."
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,9,Wed Jul 8 22:00:47 2015 UTC,"Hello, no problem!   I think eventually we'll get to a somewhat broadcast dub state with Fairy Tail. It'd be really challenging with such a big/out-of-town cast, though.  I think it's matured a bit since we've started. Happy probably won't be cussing any time soon, but Natsu, Gray and Gajeel can get pretty PG-13. A certain someone getting shot in the head was pretty freaking brutal.  We'll take breaks every now and then, but I think it's fair to assume that we'll dub the whole show in a timely manner, and I doubt you'll ever see any prolonged delay.    You're welcome again!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,EpicCenter134,9,Tue Jul 14 01:31:57 2015 UTC,Hello Kyle. I was wondering how the anime dubbing industry is. What stresses do you have to deal with/ what are the moments that stand out to you? Do you have to go out job hunting often or does your reputation help you get offers and has it always been that way? Any actors that you particularly enjoy working with/ are a bit difficult to work with :P?
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,5,Thu Jul 9 08:01:36 2015 UTC,"Hello. It's great! Deadlines, especially with broadcast dubs can sometimes be stressful, but as long as you aren't lazy it's no problem. Casting a new major character can be stressful but in a fun way. Job hunting? No. I've been working full-time at FUNimation for over seven years. Todd is a good friend so we always have a good time. I kinda answered this one earlier. Difficult to work with? No one really. Carrie Savage used to be somewhat infamous among engineers for her somewhat picky headphone demands. She's really talented, though, and I wish she lived in Texas still, so I could cast her in my shows!"

If nothing else though, if you ever see this, thank you and Funi so much for always doing such a great job with these dubs. I've always stood behind you guys cause you do the best work dubbing these shows, both in the writing and the voice acting, and you're doin' God's Work helping get these shows to people who wouldn't otherwise watch them and often times giving them a second life. So, thank you all~"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,3,Tue Jul 14 04:00:18 2015 UTC,Thank you! What's your question? I'll let you ask! I tend to lurk on reddit.
Animedubs,3ccee5,SummerSatellite,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"Oh god, thank you! :x Well, so many people in this sort of thing always ask about the path to becoming a voice actor, but nobody ever seems to ask about the way to get in to being the translator/ dub script writer for a company like Funi. I'm sure it has a ton to do with stuff like having connections and putting yourself out there like voice acting does, but what about stuff such as what classes to take, what experience to get for yourself? Ever since I watched the director's commentary on Steins;Gate (oh god was it Patrick Seitz or Michael J Tatum? I can't remember which and that's bad, but I know I got to sit in on a Q&A Michael did at a convention which was also awesome) I've loved the idea of writing for those dubs. Not only transliterating it, but then matching up mouth flaps, trying to stick as close to the original intent as possible, but also knowing how to use stuff like pop-culture references to get across a meaning to the audience... :V Which means it sounds like I definitely need to check out the dub for UOT now, which I hadn't been doing previously.  My ranting aside, yeah, what do you really need to get a job like that? Do you need a background in acting or theater to be able to really understand the ins and outs of the position? Is it necessary to have a full fluency in Japanese, or is it more important to just be able to understand stuff like why a character uses speech patterns or what a certain sentence references? And again, what sort of college classes (even majors) would be most helpful with that sort of career?  (Rant over, thank you again for your time.)"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,2,Tue Jul 14 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure how to get to be a translator, but they're super certified and have degrees in Japanese and stuff like that. Our script adapters don't do any translating at all. It's all fitting flaps, being consistent with character traits/voices and having it make sense for Western audiences. Background in acting or writing only helps. Having funimation style booth recording experience helps a lot, which is why a lot of our writers are former/current directors/actors. Our writing is exclusively dialogue driven, so practicing writing dialogue in general is really helpful. Creative writing! Learning to write from the different character ""voices"" as opposed to just your voice is vital. As far as how to get in with FUNimation's writing team? I think we post job openings every once in a while, but it's not very easy to get in. Generally it's on a recommendation basis."
Animedubs,3ccee5,SummerSatellite,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:48:09 2015 UTC,Just more hard work and heavy practice till you can sneak in when nobody's watching and amaze everyone with your talents and dedication before they can throw you out get your foot in the door it seems.

Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,3,Wed Jul 8 15:29:03 2015 UTC,"Hello!  Consistent gain and sticking to TV/DVD volume standards. Performance wise, keeping the environment in mind i.e. if the characters are in a helicopter, they're probably going to be yelling to be heard.   We use the Sennheiser TLM 103, with a pop screen hanging out in front. Mic is angled about 45 degrees back aiming up at the actors mouth. Actors mouth is about a ""hang ten"" away from the pop screen.  Our mix engineers! They're awesome and have been doing this for a very long time. They just stick to those standards.  Pro Tools.

Also, Fairy Tail is my favorite anime, how has getting to know the series made you think of it ? What do you do as the assistant director of this dub?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,6,Wed Jul 8 20:42:52 2015 UTC,"Hello! Interviewed out of audio technical school in '07, didn't get the job. Did a 3 month internship at another studio, met Chris Sabat there, the rest is history.   I love the music in Fairy Tail. It never fails to get me pumped up or crying. Basically, I would direct the overflow/night sessions. Or direct sessions when Tyler was sick/out of town, etc. Tyler would still review everything and give the thumbs up, but basically full-on direct."
Animedubs,3ccee5,miranasaurus,2,Tue Jul 14 01:28:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply! I concur about the Fairy Tail soundtrack - I can literally go for weeks without listening to much else :p Keep up the good work!
Animedubs,3ccee5,JeremyMcDev,6,Tue Jul 14 02:22:05 2015 UTC,How difficult is the timeline to maintain on a broadcast dub and do you think Fairy Tail may eventually become a broadcast dub? Or is the fact that Todd and Cherami are living in LA make it to difficult logistics wise?
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,5,Thu Jul 9 19:44:22 2015 UTC,"Not very. A week to record, a couple days to mix and review, goes up on the site a few days later. A hard deadline is actually a little more relieving than a soft one because it forces you to be organized so you get your stuff done no problem. I think it will eventually turn into a kind of broadcast dub. Maybe we'll release them in batches or something as opposed to one a week. Yes, the out-of-towners would make it a little more challenging to broadcast dub."

Go to college if you can and take acting classes and get a bachelor's degree just in case you don't make it as an actor. Do theater. Get an agent. Be professional and easy to work with. Nothing gets you not cast again faster than being an asshole. Also, bringing cookies to audition doesn't hurt!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,JeremyMcDev,5,Tue Jul 14 01:34:12 2015 UTC,Out of the voice actors you've worked with which actors seem to have the best flap timing and are able to get everything right in the first take? Are there any voice actors that really blow you away in the booth or are a step above the rest?
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,9,Thu Jul 9 19:49:14 2015 UTC,"Todd. Houston actors (ADV, or sentai) are used to working without previewing the japanese first, so they usually can give you something useable on a first take. When I first started directing, I thought I had an idea of who was good and who wasn't from when I was an engineer. I knew Lindsay Seidel was good, but the first time I directed her she blew me away at how good she was."

When doing transfers (to Blu Ray), how hard is it to clean up audio of old anime like Trigun or something from an earlier time (Hellsing when it first came out, another example). The same goes for video but audio is your speciality so mainly the audio. Thanks again!  Clarification: as in don't know, I mean I don't think you ever worked in stuff like that."
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,4,Tue Jul 14 00:09:19 2015 UTC,"The audio cleanup isn't hard, it just takes time. Probably....... 1-3 hours an ep? Yeah, no idea on the video end. I assume it's much, much harder."

To be honest, I've never heard of an ADR engineer until reading this. But, it must be pretty important!  2) How did you end up in the anime industry and with Funimation?  3) How fast are the turnaround times for Voice Actors in between shows? When someone is finished working on one show, do they go searching right away for another show to audition for?   4) What has been the reception of these relatively new broadcast dubs from the Voice Actors' POV? Has it been more demanding on them? Or are they enjoying the opportunity to work on currently airing shows? How about from the ADR Directors or Engineers' POV?  5) I see that you were the Lead ADR Director for Date a Live. What was it like to work on that particular show? Did you enjoy working with the likes of Joel McDonald, Josh Grielle, and Alexis Tipton? It's one of my favourite shows!  6) Do you have a favourite anime where you weren't a part of the staff & production?   Sorry for asking so many questions! Thanks for doing this AMA! Keep up the good work with Ultimate Otaku Teacher. I've seen a few dubbed episodes and it's pretty funny!"

Good audio quality recordings, session/file management, back end clean up.   2) Met Chris Sabat while I was interning at Dallas Audio Post and he got me the interview with FUNi.   3) Actors can work on multiple shows at the same time and they can overlap with newer shows as they come in.   4) Local actors like them because it can be a steady source of income, plus they're at the studio more in general so they get more exposure to the other directors. Out of owners generally can't be cast because of the weekly commitment. Lazier directors don't like the weekly deadline :-P. Workload hasn't really changed for Engineers.   5) Date A Live was fun minus the one time one of our hard drives crashed in the middle of the session and we lost about a day's worth of work. Yes, yes and yes! Glad you like it.  6) Answered this earlier, so I'll add. Show by Rock is one of the cuter shows I've seen recently, and the animation is great. I think a lot of little girls out there are gonna love it.   No problem! You're welcome! THANK YOU!"
Animedubs,3ccee5,GanymedeBlu35,5,Tue Jul 14 01:55:15 2015 UTC,Once again thank you Kyle for doing this AMA. My question is: did you watch Toonami when it first started airing in the late '90s and if so what was your favorite(s) show featured on their block?
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,4,Tue Jul 14 00:24:05 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I did! It was surreal meeting Sabat for the first time. ""This bald dude is the voice of Vegeta?!"" Sabat is awesome and hilarious. Yu Yu Hakusho and DBZ. I had a VHS tape that I would tape over again and again with the newest ep of DBZ. It eventually broke. I liked the 1-3 minute music videos they did on Toonami, too. I have them all on a mix cd somewhere..."
Animedubs,3ccee5,flight-by-flatulence,3,Tue Jul 14 02:02:59 2015 UTC,"Assuming Funimation licenses season 8 of One Piece, anything in particular you're looking forward to with Marco?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,6,Mon Jul 13 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"Voicing him! I've only done like, 15 lines so I'm stoked about getting to the Marineford arc. He's probably the most different voice I've done, so it'll be a fun challenge."
Animedubs,3ccee5,tacos4lolz,3,Tue Jul 14 01:45:52 2015 UTC,"Hey Kyle, thanks for taking the time to do this AMA.  Have you ever hated or despised a character you had to voice for?  On the other hand, what was your favorite character to voice?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,6,Mon Jul 13 23:28:32 2015 UTC,You're welcome!  Hated or despised? Hmm... no. I usually get to do fun or cartoony stuff. Sakuya in We Without Wings was a lot of fun but the content of the show almost made me want to back out. Almost. Marco has been brutal because it's been sooooo long since I've voiced him! Can't wait till ep 461! My favorite? Jason is always fun. Cool-a-doodle doo! I just voiced a creature that was a lot of fun that hasn't been announced yet. Keep your eyes peeled!
Animedubs,3ccee5,kinght6,3,Tue Jul 14 01:59:16 2015 UTC,Hi Kyle thanks for doing this ama and I have two questions: 1. I doubt you could tell us but any news on Evangalion 3.33? 2. What are your favorite dubed mecha anime (mine is Eureka 7)?
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,6,Tue Jul 14 01:20:18 2015 UTC,"Hello and you're welcome!  1. Your doubts are correct. No idea.  2. Gundam Wing! Oh yeah, I should've added that on to the last question I answered. I loved gundam wing on toonami."
Animedubs,3ccee5,kinght6,2,Tue Jul 14 02:04:06 2015 UTC,Thanks for answering
Animedubs,3ccee5,taylorstar,3,Tue Jul 14 03:55:31 2015 UTC,"Hi kyle im a big fan of character mannerisms(?) in anime, an example of this is Fairy Tails character Ichiya saying men in almost every sentence, how challenging is it to bring those quirks into an english dub?"
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,6,Tue Jul 14 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"Hello! We love Ichiya's ""man"" as well. MAAAAAAAAAN. That's kinda a flap thing. Sometimes at the ends of sentences there is just an extra flap that we have to fill somehow. We generally like to incorporate them into the character without overdoing it, as it can get awkward or it doesn't make sense in English. In Fairy Tail, Cancer says ""shrimp"" at the end of most sentences... but he's a crab. So we don't do that."

Animedubs,3ccee5,ChickenPlunger,2,Tue Jul 14 02:27:52 2015 UTC,Hi Kyle! Now that you're a director. What are the differences in the style of your type of direction and say maybe Mike McFarland or Chris Sabat? Are you a jokester? I know plenty directors like pulling pranks too!
Animedubs,3ccee5,KylePhillipsFUNi,3,Tue Jul 14 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"My style of directing is most like Tyler's since he was my directing mentor and I assistant directed for him.

Animedubs,3c87jo,JeremyMcDev,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:19:11 2015 UTC,I am hoping they eventually get to simuldub status. It'd probably be 2018 before it happened I'm betting where they still have so much ground to make up. It's a fine line for sure where if they went to fast it'd probably hurt DVD sales.

I pointed out that the same is true for Japanese voice actors and the response was, ""But since I can't understand the language, I can't hear the flaws that well.""  Like... I have no words to that kind of double standard."
Animedubs,3c0cv6,The-Sublimer-One,8,Fri Jul 3 17:25:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've had people tell me that all the voice actors are terrible, except the ones in Baccanno, Cowboy Bebop and FMA:BH as they're well VA'd... I then point out that those voice actors are the same voice actors in ALL DUBBED ANIME.  There's also the idea of unless you understand the language, the inflections and tone of a voice is ultimately lost... Also it just becomes white noise for me."
Animedubs,3c0cv6,The-Sublimer-One,8,Fri Jul 3 18:49:52 2015 UTC,"the inflections and tone of a voice is ultimately lost...    Pretty much. Here's a great example I saw in another thread that /u/potentialPizza came up with:  A sentence can have many different meanings depending on what word is stressed. ""I didn't eat his sandwich"" can have five different meanings depending on the word on which emphasis is placed. But if that was in Japanese and subbed, you wouldn't necessarily know what it meant because languages can have vastly different grammar. So if the word that is stressed is the hypothetical word ""fnarg"", you wouldn't actually know what meaning it was meant to have. But when it's dubbed, and it turns out that ""his"" was the word that was dubbed, then you can actually understand it. Many similar subtleties simply can't be conveyed if you have to divide the meaning between the voice and the written words."
Animedubs,3c0cv6,Clannad-Feelchair,3,Fri Jul 3 19:22:49 2015 UTC,What if subs bolded or did something for words that are stressed? I feel like subbs should be enhanced somehow to have a better translation.
Animedubs,3c0cv6,The-Sublimer-One,2,Sat Jul 4 01:12:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Even the official BluRay subs (which for the most part are really good, translating signs in the same font as the sign itself, etc.) need to work on this."

I found a site that had the anime Soul Eater on it, it was in dub, but it also had the subs at the same time, if you watch carefully the dialogue is all messed up, one person could be making a sarcastic joke about something in dub voice, and the sub is reading out as an insult rather than sarcasm. I try reading subs, but they don't make any sense sometimes, the cultural speaking differences really pop out.   An example could be like this; Sub: Guys look at the dancing freak, he is crazy! Dub: What the hell is wrong with you, we're in public you psycho!  Also it's the emotional value in the voices, someone screaming in another language and having to read what the heck their doing is ludicrous in my mind. When watching something in your own language, you can relate more to it, because...well... you speak the damn language lol.  Not trying to push in a wedge or anything, but I like watching something with my own languages emotion in it, not all dubs are perfect, but not all subs are perfect either. So people trying to start crap about what's better is a mute argument, it's preference, if you like dub then great, if you like sub than great too. I'm a dub guy, what the hell do I know right LOL."

Animedubs,3c0cv6,Kafke,3,Fri Jul 3 18:04:29 2015 UTC,"The most common that I see is that the voice acting is bad. In my mind if someone is saying that then they haven't seen the anime in dub format and are just saying it to hate on dubs. Now granted there are some anime that do actually have bad voice acting, but those are far and few between.  I mean seriously, when we have top talent like Cirpsin Freeman, Johnny Yong Bosch, Todd Haberkorn, and a whole host of others that argument doesn't fly anymore."
Animedubs,3c0cv6,The-Sublimer-One,4,Sat Jul 4 20:10:44 2015 UTC,"""It'll never be dubbed, the jokes wouldn't work.""   I generally hold this position. Some anime just have stuff that wouldn't work in a dub (but works alright in a sub). I think most famously are the 'engrish' jokes. Both Steins;Gate and K-On both have something like this, and were both dubbed. The dub pretty much wrecked the joke. Because there's no way to get across the popularity and general attitude towards english (a foreign language) while also showing inability to speak it, and make a joke off it. Dubs have done a variety of things, and failed every time IMO. K-On simply used another language (I think french?) and the joke fell flat. Steins;Gate changed it to ""gangsta talk"", and then the joke became racist and unfunny.  Likewise, anything involving lots of cultural stuff generally gets a shit dub. Again K-On is a good example. Do you change Yen to dollars? Are they in Japan? Ace Attorney (game) is famous for ""localizing"" and ultimately changing the entire theme of the  game, and having to bastardize some stuff to make it work. 4kid's dubs are some good examples as well (Jelly donuts! In actuality are rice balls).  And then ultimately we have restrictions on the dub translation, as it has to 'fit' the mouths/scenes, while subtitles don't. Again, leading to lower quality translations.  Now, I'm a guy who likes dubs. But I can clearly see when they fail. Not everything works in english (but is okay getting subs), and that's alright.  The other problematic area would be wordplay/puns. EVERY time, it fails hard. The words don't sound like what they are saying, sometimes the meaning is changed entirely, etc. Nichijou has a few jokes like this, and those scenes fall flat (even when subtitled). Though I'm sure they are great if you understood Japanese.  That said, there are dubs I think are better because they are in english and wouldn't work as Japanese. A good example of this is Baccano. No way in hell would I watch that subbed. Not that it wouldn't work, but it's more of a theming issue.  Haruhi is another one I don't like subbed. Crispin Freeman's interjections as Kyon aren't in the subbed version, and really up the quality. The Haruhi series also pretty commonly 'tweaks' things to make it more enjoyable for an english audience, without altering any of the meaning. The sub version falls flat, as it's comparatively bland.  Bottom line is that some stuff just doesn't work with english audio, just like how some stuff doesn't work with Japanese audio. And some stuff doesn't even translate through subs, though you can get the meaning across.  Other issues are censoring/localization. Lots of times a dub will change references so that english speakers can understand it (again, see Yen to Dollars). Do you localize ""nyan""? What about honorifics? Haruhi gets a bit weird in the dub because they keep the honorifics, but change it to be the english versions ""Miss asahina"". It doesn't quite work, but it's made up for with the rest of the content. I've seen dubs that quite literally keep the Japanese suffixes. And I've seen dubs that change ""sensei"" into ""Professor"" (coughYuki-chancough).  It's all about picking the right language for the right job. That, and certainly the VAs can be better/worse.   So... what are some of the annoying arguments you've seen at the dismissal of dubs as an anime form?   The weeaboo 'subs are better because it's Japanese'. That and the blind outright dismissal of dubs for no reason other than ""they aren't the original version!"""
Animedubs,3c0cv6,Kafke,3,Fri Jul 3 18:59:52 2015 UTC,K-On simply used another language (I think french?)   You're thinking of the Chuunibyou dub. K-On's dub is as faithful as you can get.
Animedubs,3c0cv6,GibbsLAD,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:18:28 2015 UTC,"here's one issue. Though I honestly didn't see the movie, so these scenes aren't what I'm talking about.  Anyway, the scene I'm talking about (I can't seem to find it), I think was in one of the OVAs. They are sitting on a bench and ""speaking english"", and failing hard at it (typical engrish joke). Which would be fine, until you realize that in the dub they keep the joke, but simply switch the language they are speaking.  Lemme pull out my K-On stuff and see if I can find the exact scene for you.  Though I remembering while watching it there were a lot of issues because they just kept the exact phrasing, but they were speaking english (I'm speaking Japanese! === They are speaking english. English is hard! === They are speaking english). With subs, it's understandable, with dubs it's outright gibberish unless you acknowledge that the original source was in Japanese. And then as I mentioned, the yen->dollars thing. Along with other problematic stuff. But I loved the voices to much to switch to the sub.  Edit: If it helps, they were sitting on a bench when discussing it. And I'm pretty sure it was in one of the OVAs. Definitely K-On though."
Animedubs,3c0cv6,JefferyUchiha,2,Fri Jul 3 19:28:52 2015 UTC,"Thats an amazing point, I never thought of that."
Animedubs,3c1cje,notorious2122,6,Fri Jul 3 21:25:49 2015 UTC,"I'm really looking forward to a dub of Prison School, if you've read the manga than you know it is awesome! My main concern is the dub actors, I really hope they don't add in Greg Ayres, he's alright but, you know. also Josh Grelle, it seems like he is in every single anime gets kinda old lol.  Also, that last link you posted about the chart, does that site have a specific chart for dubs only?"
Animedubs,3c1cje,Reaper_Hellscythe,3,Sat Jul 4 03:33:15 2015 UTC,"Ohh yeaa Greg Ayres is just...yuck. I heard prison school is hilarious though and am looking forward to it, should be an easy pick for funi to dub.   Ummm regarding charts for dubs, no it doesn't. It just does charts for Japan. Only a few shows are simuldub anyways, and that is almost exclusively by funimation."
Animedubs,3c1cje,CaptCanadaA,4,Sat Jul 4 09:20:55 2015 UTC,"Aside from all of the Funimation series, which I expect most of to get dubbed, I'm hoping for dubs of God Eater, Charlotte, and Rokka: Braves of the Six Flowers."
Animedubs,3c1cje,Clannad-Feelchair,5,Sat Jul 4 06:11:08 2015 UTC,Charlotte all the way:)

Animedubs,3c1cje,Djdray17,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:58:01 2015 UTC,For dub? Probably won't hear anything about it until at least a couple months after its done airing.
Animedubs,3c1cje,razorlikeblue,5,Tue Jul 14 11:47:35 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I want Daily life with monster girls to be  dubbed but i doubt it with til about a year later"

Animedubs,3bxpvb,shwag945,7,Fri Jul 3 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"Awesome, been holding off watching this until a dub comes out."

Animedubs,3bxpvb,Clannad-Feelchair,3,Fri Jul 3 01:05:06 2015 UTC,Dude I have too!  So happy its finally happening I have been wanting to watch this one forever.
Animedubs,3bxpvb,Thinkingpotato,6,Fri Jul 3 02:46:28 2015 UTC,Really awesome news this was definitely one of the more recent anime that I really wanted to get a dub. Definitely looking forward to it and I can't wait.
Animedubs,3bxpvb,Overlord3k,2,Fri Jul 3 01:04:05 2015 UTC,I know! I had a bet with a steam friend that if it was not dubbed in a year and a half I would have to watch it subbed. (since i have so much to watch i was in no hurry to watch it).
Animedubs,3bxpvb,Overlord3k,3,Fri Jul 3 01:05:36 2015 UTC,Lol then you are in luck now to wait for the release. Personally I already saw it but definitely wanted a dub to rewatch. One of my favorite anime in the past year or so.
Animedubs,3bxpvb,Clannad-Feelchair,2,Fri Jul 3 01:13:03 2015 UTC,Anyone have an educated guess when this will be finished? We talking months? A year?
Animedubs,3bxpvb,The-Sublimer-One,2,Fri Jul 3 01:36:49 2015 UTC,"Aniplex is normally fairly quick on their dubs (their Kill la Kill dub was finished releasing only a few months after the OVA came out), so I'd say a few months probably.  Gonna be pricey as fuck, though."
Animedubs,3bxpvb,wolfflame21,2,Fri Jul 3 03:29:57 2015 UTC,They are good at putting series on Netflix. So might want to wait on that.
Animedubs,3bxpvb,notorious2122,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:29:52 2015 UTC,Yeah. They make their shows very easy to watch without the boxed editions.
Animedubs,3bxmtj,JRPictures,7,Fri Jul 3 00:17:42 2015 UTC,Bummed to see Shirou and Archer get changed. Liam O'Brien's archer is on par with the original Japanese if you ask me.
Animedubs,3bxmtj,GanahaMode,3,Fri Jul 3 06:08:18 2015 UTC,That is a lot of cast changes between Fate/Zero and UBW(TV). At least Saber is not going through a third change. Hopefully based Gilgamesh does not go through a third one as well!
Animedubs,3bxmtj,shwag945,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:14:53 2015 UTC,Hopefully based Gilgamesh does not go through a third one as well!   Gilgamesh is being voiced the same guy who did him in Fate/Zero. The cast lists him as Blond Servant for some reason (probably to prevent spoilers but that doesn't quite work.)
Animedubs,3bxmtj,shwag945,2,Fri Jul 3 01:26:48 2015 UTC,Awesome! I needed that. Way too many cast changes but at least both those two didn't change again.
Animedubs,3bxmtj,LighterSideOfDark,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"Unless I'm misreading, it looks like Saber, Rin, Sakura, Ilya, Kirei, Kiritsugu, and Gilgamesh are all the same as in Zero. Shiro isn't, but does Shiro even have a speaking line in Zero? I can't think of anyone else who appears in both that shows up on that list."
Animedubs,3bxmtj,shwag945,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:12:44 2015 UTC,Not the same VAs as the original series either.
Animedubs,3bxmtj,shwag945,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:18:18 2015 UTC,"Archer, Shiro, Ilya (cast change in Zero), Assassin, Rider, Shinji, Some other changes as well."
Animedubs,3bxmtj,LighterSideOfDark,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:27:16 2015 UTC,"Archer, Assassin, Rider and Shinji don't show up in Zero. How can their cast change between Zero and this?"
Animedubs,3bxmtj,shwag945,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:10:16 2015 UTC,sorry I meant between Deen F/SN and UBW. Some cast changes happened between F/SN and F/Z. Now further changes between UBW and F/SN and F/Z
Animedubs,3bxmtj,LighterSideOfDark,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:13:41 2015 UTC,"Ahkay, that makes sense. I only watched a couple episodes of the Deen show and the UBW movie, with Zero being my introduction to the entire series. Consequently, the Zero VAs were the ""right"" ones in my head."
Animedubs,3bxmtj,shwag945,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:17:42 2015 UTC,Deen is right to me but I got plenty used to the Zero Gilgamesh and Saber.
Animedubs,3bxidi,happy_Bunny1,2,Thu Jul 2 23:39:17 2015 UTC,Depends on how recent you mean.  Off the top of my head:  Devil is a Part-Timer  K-On  Good Luck Girl  Lucky Star  My Bride is a Mermaid  Baka and Test  Is This a Zombie  Girls und Panzer  The Girl Who Leapt Through Time  Haganai and Haganai NEXT  Soul Eater NOT  Toradora
Animedubs,3bxidi,The-Sublimer-One,5,Fri Jul 3 00:09:23 2015 UTC,Don't forget D-frag! Where the dub is much better than the sub.
Animedubs,3bxidi,LeSpanishRice,3,Fri Jul 3 00:33:32 2015 UTC,Of course! How could I forget the dub that gave us this line ?
Animedubs,3bxidi,The-Sublimer-One,2,Fri Jul 3 00:40:36 2015 UTC,One of my favorite but not my favorite line of the show.... so many great quote came out of that English dub that aren't part of the sub...

Animedubs,3bxrqx,Hedgito,5,Fri Jul 3 01:03:06 2015 UTC,"Really disappointed with the casting here. Shirou, Rin, and Archer all sound wrong. I like Bryce pretty well, but I'm tired of him being cast as every MC ever. I guess I'll be sticking with the sub on this one unfortunately."
Animedubs,3bxrqx,TlMB0,2,Fri Jul 3 02:55:05 2015 UTC,"That's... not the voice I expected for Rin. (EDIT) Ah, it's the same VA they gave her for Fate/Zero... I'm always skeptical when an actress tries to voice both the child and teen/adult versions of a character. There's not too many that can pull that off successfully.  However, rejoice! For Crispin Freeman continues to be Kotomine!"
Animedubs,3bxrqx,SolDarkHunter,1 point,Fri Jul 3 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"Didn't watch much of the trailer to avoid spoilers, but I'm very excited about this. Stated release date is 8/25/2015."
Animedubs,3bxrqx,MangoTangoFox,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:58:11 2015 UTC,considering the cast changes between FN/S and F/Z now the changes between these the Deen and UBW series the cast is so different :/
Animedubs,3by8vi,Saber778,4,Fri Jul 3 03:38:24 2015 UTC,I would imagine chances are pretty good as I believe everything else Sentai has from KyoAni for the last several years has been dubbed.   Sentai aren't known to dub things quickly though.
Animedubs,3bv03c,anonymepelle,3,Thu Jul 2 11:08:47 2015 UTC,Sounds like fun.   Let's hope we can get enough traffic to make this worthwhile for all parties involved.
Animedubs,3bv03c,Onarax,4,Thu Jul 2 22:26:14 2015 UTC,That would be awesome

Animedubs,3bv03c,notorious2122,6,Fri Jul 3 21:34:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on the person and how much free time he or she has. We havn't worked out the details yet.  In this case we will probably post an open thread a week or so before the actual date of the AMA so people can ask their questions even if they can't be there on the actual date. Then Kyle would have an opurtunity to answer them. Ofcourse if you want ""live"" (quote un quote) interaction with him or ask followup questions you can show up on the actual time of the AMA and ask him then. :)"

Animedubs,3bv768,brandon62197,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"1) I don't know if it's dubbed, I don't think it has.    2) Because they were going bankrupt and it's easier to make an hour and a half movie compared to a full fledged season.    3) See #2. The whole thing is hard to keep up with. The pacing is sooo far off. Imagine you're on an island and then next thing you know, you're already almost to the mainland. Takes a minute to get re-situated, and this is no different. A lot ""wait.. what?"" going on, and the character development is the same. It would have been great to have a season 3, where they could have added in twice (or more) of the content and the pacing and timing would flow much better, which unfortunately isn't the case."
Animedubs,3bv768,Xhynk,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:46:03 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, that really sucks. I take it that its probably not going to get a dub if they went bankrupt. What company went bankrupt? The studio who produced the anime?"
Animedubs,3bv768,Mozillo,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:40:29 2015 UTC,"I got this feeling with the first film, if anything it felt a lot more like just a tacked on side story that really had no bearing on the plot... especially as it did the thing most anime films do where all the characters introduced in the film either die or ""are forgotten forever"" in a heroic sacrifice, seriously so many movies do this."

Animedubs,3bjjiv,adhding_nerd,0,Tue Jun 30 01:18:34 2015 UTC,I like her if for no other reason than her name is actually Steph.  That and the fact that I never actually watched the sub of this show probably means that I'm going to enjoy this more than others who have.

Animedubs,3bafkc,Ayn_Rand_Was_Right,3,Sat Jun 27 12:20:15 2015 UTC,"It's a sequel to the series that tells it's own stand alone story. It's alright. Far from as good as the series, but if you just want more FMA:B then it's worth a watch.  Edit: Seems I confused it with The Sacred Star of Milos. Like /u/The-Sublimer-One said It's a followup to the original FMA, not Brotherhood. Much more worth wile than The Sacred Star of Milos is and is much more of a real sequel to FMA than Milos is to FMA:B. Definitly worth it if you've seen the original FMA, if not then there's not much point. It follows a different continuety than FMA:B and is completely unrelated to that story."
Animedubs,3bafkc,NeonFangX,2,Sat Jun 27 12:33:30 2015 UTC,It should be noted that this movie is a follow-up to this original FMA series. Not Brotherhood.

Knights of Sidonia - The first season was great, can't wait for some more atmospheric survival horror action.  A Lull in the Sea - I'm a bit doubtfull wether or not this is going to be good to be honest, but I'll definitly watch it.  ALDNOAH.ZERO - Been looking forward to this for quite some time. Everyone says it sucks, but for some reason i still can't wait. And hey, some times has a bad reputation and then it turns out to be a freaking masterpiece (looking in your direction Flowers of Evil)  No Game No Life - I've heard mixed things, but it's so popular that it got to be watched."

Animedubs,3ba3d0,BalefireX,9,Sat Jun 27 05:56:59 2015 UTC,First of all the madoka dub is faaaar away from bad.  It just doesn't do moe well and as a person that dislikes moe I liked it more that the sub because it makes the characters seem more grown up. Now for your question:   I'd watch Shinsekai yuri ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) dubbed simpley for the voices of Kiroumaru and Squealer who stole the show. The rest of the cast is  very good  but those two stood out in my book.
Animedubs,3ba3d0,TwistedBOLT,2,Sat Jun 27 07:54:54 2015 UTC,+1 Kiroumaru and Squealer were awesome

Animedubs,3b6n58,TwistedBOLT,5,Fri Jun 26 12:00:18 2015 UTC,"For those that don't know how my list works and what the symbols mean please read the header:  http://myanimelist.net/animelist/TwistedBOLT  (Also looking for feedback on my remade style and for recommendations on what to watch next)  I didn't participate in this post last week so I will just be writing about the last 2 weeks: Let's start    Mysterious Girlfriend X I wanted to throw up so many times so I put it on hold after 6 episodes. I have a weak stomach so sorry to everyone that actually likes the show. I promise I'll come back to watch it eventually.    Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They? Long title, short show I really wish there was more of this to watch. If you didn't watch it, imagine if log horizon had a baby with no game no life.   Pros: Lots of colorful characters, interesting word, no problems with the dub, good opening.  Cons: Too fast paced and most characters don't have enough screen time. Too much fanservice a bit of ass-pull logic.  Overall pretty enjoyable.   Overall grade: 8☁.    Gankutsuou (The Count of Monte Cristo) Damn. That was... Damn... Saying what I like about the show will spoil most of it. Let's just say it's impossible to predict.  Pros: Story, Music (I Love that the opening and ending are in English) A lot of good characters especially the count, The show has a really good understanding of human emotions and pushing characters to the breaking point. Set in an alternative France which is a good change from the sea of Japanese highschools. Amazing dub! The art is also amazing!  Cons: The art. I know that's contradictory to what I said before but the art really takes some time to get adjusted to. But once you do it's rather enjoyable.  Overall grade: 9★.    Noragami  Nothing special in my opinion the show was good... but it was nothing special.  I don't want to write the pros and cons simple because nothing was sticking out good or bad. If I want to compare it to something it would be blue exorcist to be honest the shows are very similar as they are both pretty mediocre and predictable but also enjoyable.   Overall grade 7.    Shinreigari: Ghost Hound Yet another amazing show. I wouldn't necessarily call it a mindfuck but it's definitely far from predictable.  Pros: A few good characters, The opening, the story and the world itself. The show also covers over a lot of topics related to psychology and philosophy which I enjoyed immensely.  Cons: These awful designs (Everyone that watched it saw that con coming) and apart of that... not much..  Overall grade: 9☁    Clannad and Clannad: After Story  Pros: Clannad: After Story  Cons: Clannad    Alright, alright that's not all I have to say about those two, it's a joke...   Clannad is meh, boring and It's forgettable, the only good thing it does is setting up the characters, the town and everything else for the After Story.  Overall grade: 6☁  The After Story is amazing on the other hand I went in to it saying ""HAH my heart is a brick you can't fucking make me cry you silly Chinese cartoon"" and boy was I wrong. It takes your heartstrings and instead of gently pulling on them it starts playing DragonForce - Through The Fire And Flames on them. It was a journey that I was glad to take a part in I even cried once, on episode 20 and I'll leave it at that.   Pros: A good portrayal of growing up. Believable characters each broken in their own way. It gives us ovas for multiple ending with your favourite girl which is nice. Very emotional. Good music that fits the tone of the show and makes you emotionally connected ti it so that the song you enjoyed in the beginning and got bored of it in the middle hits you like a baseball bat of emotions near the end.   Cons: The windup on this roller-coaster of emotions is endless taking an entire season and a half to begin to be good. But god damn it was it worth it! The only other problem I had with it was the dub. Don't get me wrong the dub is decent and perfectly watchable but some pronunciations were a bit off and there's also a few things here and there that could have been a bit better.   Overall grade: 9☁ (As someone who doesn't enjoy slice-of-life this is the highest grade I can give it)    Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann There was drilling in that show... But I'm pretty sure there was drilling in the studio that made the show. They were drilling some poor chaps ass to see how much logic can they pull out of it and still make something that they can call a story. It tries too hard to one up itself, makes no sense half the bloody time, it's predictable as all hell, has more plot holes than a sponge made of Swiss cheese episode 4 looked like absolute dog crap and honestly... I don't give a shit. It was balls to the wall awesome but only if you do what the show tells you do do and that's to kick out logic and just enjoy the bloody thing. I enjoyed it enough to make this so at least that says something I guess.  Pros: Mindless fun. Row, row fight the power!  Cons: Too many to count but they don't stop you from enjoying it so I won't list them...   Overall grade: 8☀    I'm currently watching Tokyo ravens and the Rozen maiden re-wind.  That's about it. Thanks for reading if you did."
Animedubs,3b6n58,The-Sublimer-One,2,Sat Jun 27 11:17:56 2015 UTC,"Wow. Surprising and cool to see you rated Psycho-Pass 2 higher than season one.  Sad to see you dropped K-On. One of the best dubs I've ever heard. The VAs couldn't have been more spot-on, but I get that moe isn't for everyone."
Animedubs,3b6n58,TwistedBOLT,2,Mon Jun 29 01:51:31 2015 UTC,"Both psycho passes were decent shows but the paradox presented at the end of season two was the reason I rated it higher.   K-on teally isn't for me. I'll try to watch it again some day when my tolerance for similar shows goes up a bit but for now, I just can't especially because of the slice of life part which I just can't stand."
Animedubs,3b6n58,The-Sublimer-One,2,Mon Jun 29 07:12:26 2015 UTC,"I also saw Girls und Panzer on your dropped list. That would probably be a good show for easing you into moe, due to how much tank action is interspersed between the cute girl bits."
Animedubs,3b6n58,TwistedBOLT,2,Mon Jun 29 13:48:25 2015 UTC,I only saw the first episode and the tank bits looke horrible!
Animedubs,3b6n58,The-Sublimer-One,2,Mon Jun 29 14:34:28 2015 UTC,They get a lot better. The first episode is really just as much of a warm-up for us as it is to the girls.

Animedubs,3b6n58,Ayevee,2,Fri Jun 26 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"Shiki - Rating (74/100)  Surprisingly good, it started out feeling like a worse Shinsekai Yori, but by the end I was really enjoying myself. Make sure you watch the extra two episodes in the right order, they're really good.  D-Frag - 81  My first school comedy, heard it was really good with amazing voice acting, and people were right. Must watch for sure.  Expelled from Paradise - 91  Just finished this an hour ago, holy shit, I had high expectations and it still blew me away. The fight scenes combined with the music was just a constant surge of goosebump ecstasy. Though there's not that many fights, the content in between is still great; an interesting, thought provoking, and unpredictable story. The characters are okay, and there's really no supporting characters, which kind of sucks but it doesn't get in the way much."
Animedubs,3b6n58,The-Sublimer-One,2,Fri Jun 26 12:39:14 2015 UTC,"Finished Haganai and Haganai NEXT. They were both absolutely hilarious, and I'm so glad Kodaka finally got some sense beat into him by Rika. I hear the light novel gets stupid after this, though, so hopefully if they ever make a third season, they'll shy away from staying totally faithful to it.  It also gave me this amazing reaction WebM that I can use: http://w.webms.org/m/LG1detHk.webm  Currently watching My Bride is a Mermaid. It's really funny, but damn do I feel bad for the MC."

Animedubs,3b6n58,Niko_Liez,2,Sat Jun 27 16:14:43 2015 UTC,"Soul Eater - Pretty ""fun"" series, feels more like a cartoon than a anime. Nothing to take serious. Its something I watch before I goto bed. Something you dont have to pay alot of attention to.  Assassination Classroom - I really didnt expect this one to be good, but man its pretty awesome. Nothing deep or to serious, just pure enjoyment and the dub is pretty good.  Noragami - Just started this one, and only 3 episodes in. Has some humor and potential to get serious. Another pretty solid dub.  Rahxephon - Not sure how I feel about this one yet. Not really grabbing me, but I feel like it could at any moment. Most likely will get dropped.  Tokyo Ghoul - I completed this one sometime ago, but felt I should mention it as alot of people may pass it up. Currently only the second season is dubbed, but funimation should be releasing the season 1 dub soon. This anime is awesome! Lots of action, suspense, and gore. This will be a day 1 buy for me."
Animedubs,3b6n58,iWoWiS,2,Fri Jun 26 13:11:42 2015 UTC,"Soul Eater Not - Boring  Assassination Classroom - Really Good  Blood Blockade Battlefront - i'm on episode 6 and still don't know what this is about?  Seraph of the End - had a Slow Start but Good so far  Kill La Kill - not understanding how this saved anime?  Noragami - Great, but Yuki is a terrible character maybe worse than Haru from Accel World  Heroic Legend of Arslan - I have only seen the first episode but I didnt like it  Ultimate Otaku Teacher - its Hilarious!!"
Animedubs,3b6n58,The-Sublimer-One,2,Fri Jun 26 15:23:54 2015 UTC,Kill La Kill - not understanding how this saved anime?   Clearly you missed something. Go back and watch it again and again and again and again and again until your will breaks.
Animedubs,3b6n58,TwistedBOLT,2,Fri Jun 26 15:26:04 2015 UTC,"The reason kill la kill ""saved anime"" was because free! ""ruined anime"" so apparently anime needed a saviour."
Animedubs,3b6n58,the_light_of_dawn,2,Sat Jun 27 09:40:58 2015 UTC,"I just started the second season of Space Dandy. The first season was pretty decent, but I have heard the second season is far better.  I also watched Ghost in the Shell earlier this week and it was absolutely stellar."

Animedubs,3b6n58,the_light_of_dawn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:02:42 2015 UTC,Not yet!
Animedubs,3b6n58,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:04:23 2015 UTC,You need the viewing order? Also did you watch the 2.0 Gits or the original version?
Animedubs,3b6n58,the_light_of_dawn,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:07:58 2015 UTC,All I have seen is the '95 Ghost in the Shell. I'd love a viewing order!
Animedubs,3b6n58,TwistedBOLT,2,Sat Jun 27 17:10:14 2015 UTC,2.0 is a remake watch it after you've watched everything else and a reasonable amount of time has passed.  Watch Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence first. People have mixed opinions about this one but I enjoyed it immensely but most regard it mumbo-jumbo. If you like mindfucks it's awesome if you don't... well... Let's just say that the pause button and google are your friends. You'll need them to properly have your mind blown. Sentences are long and use scary words... I know this sounds stupid or childish but it's true. You really need to stop and think about the stuff they say.  Next you'll watch the stand alone complex follow it up with stand alone complex 2nd gig and then Solid State Society.  Skip the laughing man  and Individual eleven movies because they are just recaps of the first and 2nd season.   And finish off with the Ghost in the Shell: Arise movies (Only 2 are dubbed so far)  Have fun. IMO the best part is the 2nd season of the standalone complex.
Animedubs,3b6n58,superange128,2,Sat Jun 27 19:37:54 2015 UTC,"Bro and I are catching up Kill la Kill dub and it's pretty awesome.  Aniplex of America may charge you a bazillion bucks to actually buy their shows but they (and the dubbing company) really know how to get the best California VAs for the job  Lots of newer/underused VAs that really got to show off their stuff (Erica Mendez, Carrie Keranen, Sarah Willams) as well as rising stars that continue to be awesome (Matt Mercer, Christine Cabanos) as well as the typically awesome ones (Stephanie Sheh,  Patrick Seitz, Todd Haberkorn)"
Animedubs,3b6n58,titandrop23,2,Fri Jun 26 16:55:58 2015 UTC,"I like all the many episode shows in English, for sure. One Piece, Naruto, Fairy Tail, Dragon Ball, the ones that you'll be watching for years. And I gotta say One Piece dub is annoying at first but after a while I've come to love the voice acting! It's one of my favorite English Dubs and now I can't watch it japanese anymore.  But my rule if the English is fine, I'll watch it in English. If it annoys me or if I've heard a certain voice actor way too many times lately I'll watch in Japanese. Also if I watch the entire show in Japanese first it's hard to watch the English version. Oh yeah, almost forgot, Fullmetal Alchemist and Soul Eater are also awesome in English!"
Animedubs,3b6n58,Piker10,2,Fri Jun 26 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"Finished Gunslinger Girl, really liked it and will be moving onto the second season and OVA's. 2 eps away from finishing Soul Eater Not! which is pretty funny. Apart from that havent really had much time to watch anything full on, but ive had anime's like Ga-Rei Zero on in the background as i work [first ep i was like WTF IS GOING ON!]"
Animedubs,3b6n58,GoodSirMatthew_2,2,Mon Jun 29 18:16:22 2015 UTC,"Angel Beats, it's very funny,  the dub is on point"
Animedubs,3b6n58,MrReynevan2,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:57:10 2015 UTC,"I'm glad you asked:  Assasination Classroom - 17 - Well, what can I say? FUNimation, the most accurate description.  Ultimate Otaku Teacher - 1-3/3 - Started it because I accidentally clicked ""Random"" button on my anime player. Didn't expect much, watched all 3 episodes in one go, loved it. Both the anime, as well as the dub are awesome. I really recommend it to everyone.  The Legend of Legendary Heroes - 12-21/24 - Really good anime, somewhat chaotic at the beginning, and slow-paced, but it's really interesting fantasy tale.   Genshiken - 1-10/12 - It's not my favourite dub, but it's certainly an interesting show. I still wonder how they did it, because from what I can remember, the Kujibuki Unbalance OVA that was released had the exact same dialogue lines and voice actors as kujibuki from Genshiken. A mysery indeed. The unique feel of this show makes it really interesting. I'm glad I finally found time to watch it ;D"
Animedubs,3b6n58,JRPictures,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:40:30 2015 UTC,"Currently Watching:  Ping Pong The Animation: A random choice made since AnimeLab put up the dub before we were to get the DVD/Blu-Ray in August. Really good so far, the characters especially shine. The dub's pretty stellar too, handling the Chinese dialogue scenes really well.  Assassination Classroom: Since the dub's finally legally available here in Aus, I'm slowly catching up. Pretty entertaining and absurd so far. Dub wins me over just for Sonny Strait's Korosensei.  Blue Exorcist: Decided to just cross this one off the watchlist while it's still around. Alright so far but nothing mindblowing. Dub's pretty standard fare but the line ""I'm gonna beat the sh*t out of Satan"" won me over.  As for stuff I've watched. I finished all of Tiger and Bunny including the two movies. Really, really good and a perfect dub too. (plus the second film has Crispin Freeman in it, need I say more?)  Also finished all of Eureka Seven, (sans AO, for obvious reasons). Definitely worth buying the DVD for. A fantastic mecha show with a great romance at its centre. Dub's great too with its perfect cast.  Expelled from Paradise was pretty good and slightly different fare from Urobuchi compared to stuff like Madoka and Fate/Zero. Dub's really good too, if only for Steve Blum who's pretty rare to hear in anime these days."
Animedubs,3b6n58,Bloodcake,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:56:59 2015 UTC,Otaku Teacher - 8.5/10 I really like it so far as it has both comedy and some simple life lessons thrown in. All the English VA's so far fit the characters pretty well.  Mikagura School Suite - 9/10 I love it. It has the kind of random humor I love. Also Monica Rial is the protagonist VA which is always a treat.
Animedubs,3b2ghf,anonymepelle,3,Thu Jun 25 12:53:13 2015 UTC,"Been waiting a long time for this dub. Hope it is as good as the hype would have you believe. It's often not the case, but I can't wait to find out for myself."
Animedubs,3b05o1,Hedgito,10,Wed Jun 24 22:19:52 2015 UTC,"I really like her, too! I wonder if /r/anime will this time...  I also really appreciate how Sentai is responding to a lot of the video comments. They really want to build a name for themselves other than just ""that dubbing company that isn't FUNimation or Aniplex."""
Animedubs,3b05o1,The-Sublimer-One,4,Wed Jun 24 22:34:34 2015 UTC,/r/Anime will never like any dubs. They are very.. set in their subbing ways and will not think outside of that tiny box they have set themselves in.
Animedubs,3b05o1,Bloodcake,6,Thu Jun 25 00:29:31 2015 UTC,What a boring way to live.
Animedubs,3b05o1,The-Sublimer-One,0,Thu Jun 25 01:37:47 2015 UTC,"Subs get just about the same hate [here] as dubs get there... Just saying.  And I know that this is called animedubs, but I still find it funny.  EDIT: Wow, forgetting a word really changes what the meaning of a sentence."
Animedubs,3b05o1,Ayn_Rand_Was_Right,5,Thu Jun 25 14:29:14 2015 UTC,"Are you serious? Dubs get FAR more hate. Dubs are viewed as Taboo by most anime watchers as if it will kill your taste in anime just because you enjoy dubs. I personally think it improves your tastes and shows your not a pompous asshole who is going to bitch and whine about how its not original or ""the anime's true form""."
Animedubs,3b05o1,Bloodcake,0,Thu Jun 25 23:03:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, I fixed my comment , I forgot a word that changed what I meant to say in a big way.   What I meant was that subs on this subreddit get the same kind of hate as dubs over there. You really need to just read through a simulcast or dub announcement thread.  And for the record, my opinion is that these are all chinese girly cartoons so it really doesn't matter how you watch them cause they are all the same shit."
Animedubs,3b05o1,Ayn_Rand_Was_Right,3,Fri Jun 26 01:11:30 2015 UTC,"I really don't see many hate comments towards subs themselves here.

Animedubs,3b05o1,Bloodcake,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:42:33 2015 UTC,"I do watch subs more, so I guess I tend to notice the comments more.

Animedubs,3b05o1,Ayn_Rand_Was_Right,2,Fri Jun 26 17:23:30 2015 UTC,"I watch more subs now then dubs mainly due to time purposes. The only show I watch in my dreary life now is One Piece. I do have Monster, Afro Samurai, and GitS waiting tho. Issue is, I never understood why they have to be compared. Funi did a great job dubbing One Piece. THEY SOUND EXACTLY THE SAME. Just different languages. The only one that does not is Franky and I like the English one better."
Animedubs,3b05o1,wolfflame21,7,Mon Jun 29 14:07:36 2015 UTC,She sounds pretty good.  And contrary to the first reveal of Sora who I thought was alright he sounded a bit better in this scene.
Animedubs,3b05o1,superange128,5,Thu Jun 25 00:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah the reveal for Sora wasn't a good one. They needed to showcase one of Sora's more memorable moments. If anything, this reveal made me actually more optimistic about him."
Animedubs,3b05o1,ClearingFlags,3,Thu Jun 25 03:48:05 2015 UTC,It is probably like Chu2 where the show sounds way better than the trailers lol.

Animedubs,3avu57,The-Sublimer-One,7,Wed Jun 24 00:01:03 2015 UTC,She was incredible as Taiga and good as Leafa/Kyuubey

Animedubs,3avu57,fooly__cooly,2,Wed Jun 24 03:51:12 2015 UTC,In terms of performance she was probably my second fav in the dub of K-ON after Christine as Azusa (who's one of my all time favorites)

Animedubs,3avu57,Angrymuffin16,4,Wed Jun 24 07:14:48 2015 UTC,I forget his name but whoever voiced Ali Al Sachez in Gundam 00 was absolutely perfect for his role and made that character shine. Same for Laad Russo in Baccano.

Animedubs,3av23n,Dragonfire13,2,Wed Jun 24 13:30:48 2015 UTC,"Oh, yeah."

Animedubs,3av23n,Zaggar,4,Tue Jun 23 20:03:27 2015 UTC,Greg Ayres as Levi from Attack on Titan. I need to see that.
Animedubs,3av23n,Angrymuffin16,2,Wed Jun 24 19:15:50 2015 UTC,Brittany Karbowski as Shenron  Christopher Sabat as Wendy Marvell
Animedubs,3av23n,Coolquip34,2,Wed Jun 24 05:21:00 2015 UTC,Valley girl Shenron? That sounds awesome.
Animedubs,3au6p8,The-Sublimer-One,4,Tue Jun 23 15:19:33 2015 UTC,Digimon S1+S2. Though mostly to have the original music and remove some of the overly cheesy jokes  The Mobile Suit Gundam Movie Trilogy so it's not a literal joke.  I'm probably the only person who wants Sonic X with a re-dub with the newer voice actors + the original music.

Animedubs,3au6p8,RogueHippie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:34:32 2015 UTC,If keeping it would be the ultimate decision maker to make the BGM the original Japanese one and removing cheesy jokes than I'd be for it.
Animedubs,3au6p8,superange128,5,Tue Jun 23 21:38:05 2015 UTC,Off the top of my head Higurashi and familiar of zero mostly because of the 2nd season that I really want to watch :/
Animedubs,3au6p8,TwistedBOLT,0,Tue Jun 23 18:50:27 2015 UTC,Higurashi just needs a redub period. Even the dub of the first season was lackluster.
Animedubs,3au6p8,superange128,0,Tue Jun 23 20:08:07 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I don't know how/why I went through S1's dub especially since Kai wasn't dubbed (and still hasn't) anyway
Animedubs,3au6p8,JesseBorrell,3,Tue Jun 23 21:38:44 2015 UTC,I feel like Rurouni Kenshin needs a better dub
Animedubs,3au6p8,KnightValores,2,Wed Jun 24 00:57:31 2015 UTC,Soul Eater for me would a great redub.
Animedubs,3au6p8,indiefolkfan,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:37:44 2015 UTC,Attack on Titan. The english dub is rushed and not all that good.
Animedubs,3au6p8,superange128,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:05:57 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would love a redub of Revolutionary Girl Utena. Even Crispin Freeman couldn't save that dub. Get a voice director who can make the actors not sound like they're sleepwalking through their lines, and I'm all for it."
Animedubs,3au6p8,Ayevee,2,Tue Jun 23 15:20:44 2015 UTC,I tried this recently and yeah I wasn't into the dub either

Animedubs,3au6p8,basedbecker,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:11:00 2015 UTC,I totally agree on Gatchaman Crowds the main characters voice annoyed me so incredibly much and the other characters seemed so bland and boring that I just couldn't take anymore so swapped to the sub for it in the end which was much better.

Animedubs,3au23c,HughSurname,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:12:49 2015 UTC,"As I said, you shouldn't expect badass action all the time, and the actual plot starts at the beginning of the 2nd episode. That being said, it really has it's moments - both action, and political/economic-related. The main hero is likeable, character development is great part of the show, and overall quality of the series is solid.  It's mostly serious, but it can be funny at times. Unfortunately, half of the jokes is repetitive, so after some time it can get a bit boring.   Ok, I guess it's enough. I say give it a try, but if you don't like journey-themed, dialogue-heavy, complicated shows, well..."

I like all of that stuff just fine, but seeing it all in one place like that..   lol it's good to know it's not an action-heavy series though, I actually kinda hate action if that's all a show's got to offer. I think the most action-y shows I would give a 10 to would be Tsuiokuhen, Geass, and Parasyte. I guess FMAB, too, but still, those all have really cool plots, twists & shitpulls (I call them Geass Nodes) and the sum of what was happening was more than just ""this guy's bad, I gotta fight him!"" And dont get me started on DBZ! 5 episodes of screaming (or running) and then 1 insane fight energy blast that damn near destroys the Earth... repeat."
Animedubs,3au23c,HughSurname,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:53:50 2015 UTC,"It did destroy Earth at some point. Just finished db series not that long ago ;D  But yeah, sometimes pointless action iis all you need, sometimes it's plot... It depends on the mood, you can't watch the same stuff all the time.

Animedubs,3au23c,rjc523,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:24:56 2015 UTC,i don't think so but i wish they would dub all seasons of it. not just the first one.
Animedubs,3au23c,Tusilos,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:56:27 2015 UTC,The first season's dub sucked anyway but no it won't. Maybe someday it will get a redub or something.
Animedubs,3apb81,JefferyUchiha,2,Mon Jun 22 12:05:39 2015 UTC,It's looking like all anime that came out before simuldubbing/simulcasting was a thing will be out a year later than the subbed version. :(
Animedubs,3apb81,GibbsLAD,2,Mon Jun 22 15:05:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah general rule seems to be about a year at least, the only show I can think of besides a simuldubbing that came out within a couple of months is Garden of Words, but that's only like 40 minutes :P  Season 2 has been picked up by Sentai though so it's probably guaranteed to get a dub, we just have to wait."

Animedubs,3aicqh,ghost63450,2,Sat Jun 20 16:15:40 2015 UTC,IIRC correctly they had all of the episodes when it was in their library before it was taken down. Seems lame they'd only put about 40% of the episodes the second time around.
Animedubs,3aicqh,ghost63450,2,Sat Jun 20 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"Even so, they did the same with all the old cartoon network shows they put on there"
Animedubs,3aicqh,twinfyre,2,Sat Jun 20 21:36:31 2015 UTC,Any other new editions to netflix?
Animedubs,3agb0w,Hedgito,5,Fri Jun 19 22:25:52 2015 UTC,This dub is fantastic.   She who mocks the turkey will be mocked by the turkey
Animedubs,3agb0w,Kafke,4,Sat Jun 20 02:42:29 2015 UTC,I like it. Of course I hope this leads to Haruhi S3.  we can hope

Animedubs,3ac380,Hedgito,5,Thu Jun 18 22:01:12 2015 UTC,I cant wait to get the collectors edition.
Animedubs,3ac380,Enchanter_Shiroe,4,Thu Jun 18 22:11:57 2015 UTC,Sentai's CE sets are really nice! I am happy to see them including more disk extras as well.

Animedubs,3ac380,TwistedBOLT,10,Fri Jun 19 08:08:26 2015 UTC,/r/Anime is full of weeaboo little plebs who can't even get that dubbed anime is on the rise. Dubbed anime is getting anime it self more popular with those who use to not be anime fans at all purely because they didn't want to read. I don't get the hate for dubs other than the fact people like to act like purists or like somehow the original form of something is somehow better.
Animedubs,3ac380,Bloodcake,8,Fri Jun 19 23:10:36 2015 UTC,"The best part is when they run out of bullshit that can actually be disproved so they just say ""It just doesn't feel right"" like that's somehow a valid argument."
Animedubs,3ac380,TwistedBOLT,3,Fri Jun 19 23:27:54 2015 UTC,The stereotype of anime fans is that there elitists and hate english dubs even though it's the  language they speak  . r/ANIME fits that stereotype to a T at times depending on the thread .
Animedubs,3ac380,razorlikeblue,2,Sun Jun 21 06:00:53 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that the stereotype needs to stop. I also wish that I could find at least 1 site that has a general consensus that dubs are, if not better, on par with subs but I doubt I ever will."
Animedubs,3ac380,Bloodcake,3,Sun Jun 21 22:47:25 2015 UTC,"Dubbed anime is getting anime it self more popular with those who use to not be anime fans at all purely because they didn't want to read.   Can confirm. I would not watch anime without dubs. I watch anime as an alternative to JRPG games, but mostly when I want to enjoy a story without committing energy to thinking and playing. I also don't enjoy wearing my glasses every time I want to watch. I can't always read the subtitles comfortably from my couch."
Animedubs,3ac380,mattbug,6,Mon Jun 22 20:29:58 2015 UTC,"This is a reason why Im glad this subreddit exists since it seems like the only dubs hardcore non-dub anime fans like are DBZ, Cowboy Bebop and Baccano  Plus its not like all dubs are 100% liked here.

Animedubs,3ab9wr,jakej1020,2,Thu Jun 18 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"Very true, but I found Psycho-Pass to be a show that really lacks the typical anime sillyness for the most part. Or even a lot of the common anime tropes. I think the creators even said that their intention was to be ""anti-moe""."

I think this show did a good job of making sure the reveals made sense to the universe."
Animedubs,3a66tp,TwistedBOLT,18,Wed Jun 17 15:21:47 2015 UTC,Monica Rial.  She's in all the Sentai stuff as a main character and in most Funimation releases in one way or another. Her generic schoolgirl voice is also really easy to notice and since most anime is set in school just exacerbates this.
Animedubs,3a66tp,Brbteabreaktv,14,Wed Jun 17 15:31:52 2015 UTC,Definitely Monica Riel.
Animedubs,3a66tp,TrueEnigma,12,Wed Jun 17 15:29:23 2015 UTC,"Monica Rial is a given, she has like the most obvious voice. Jaimie Marchi is in a boat load of crap."

Animedubs,3a66tp,Djdray17,3,Sat Jun 20 14:17:59 2015 UTC,If this was for like 2000 - 2010 luci Christian had a hand in so many dubs.
Animedubs,3a66tp,Fearflam,3,Wed Jun 17 16:00:46 2015 UTC,The thing is Luci Christian has a lot of range. I sometimes look up a character to see who it is only to realize it's her.
Animedubs,3a66tp,NotTooDistantFuture,2,Thu Jun 18 02:24:32 2015 UTC,Best Yukari ever.

Do you mean you think it shouldn't have been dubbed because it doesn't have a happy ending, and people won't be okay with that? Whether or not it was dubbed has no impact on how it ends, and plenty of people would watch it anyway.  Personally I thought it was one of the best anime movies I've ever seen. That said, it utterly destroyed me for days afterward, so I suppose I wasn't necessarily ""okay"" with the ending myself. But was it ultimately satisfying? Hell yeah."
Animedubs,39y4fd,pickelsurprise,2,Mon Jun 15 22:14:12 2015 UTC,Is there confirmation there wont be more? I thought I read somewhere the creators were pretty keen to carry on the franchise.
Animedubs,39y4fd,0mfgroflmao,4,Mon Jun 15 20:04:41 2015 UTC,Rebellion would not end the way it did if the studio wasn't insistent on going back to it. That said there is nothing official yet

Animedubs,39ruj3,JRPictures,3,Sun Jun 14 03:47:19 2015 UTC,When I first started watching dxd akeno'a va annoyed the hell out of me because of that little lisp that she had. But evantually It started to grow on me and I found myself loving the sound of akeno's voice. Then they change the va in season 3 and it sounds like she is a completely different person ):

Animedubs,39ruj3,JRPictures,0,Mon Jun 15 02:19:17 2015 UTC,Any of the roles you've heard him in this year were recorded long before he retired.  And I heard it from a lot of people around net such as here (in the comments section: http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Scott-Freeman/
Animedubs,39ruj3,Crazyripps,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:35:55 2015 UTC,Some of them were simulcast this year so not long before and just because 1 person says that doesn't make it fact. He might not be able to make it to the studio to recored just because he isn't 1 voice means he is retired and all that

Animedubs,39ruj3,Kxr1der,2,Sun Jun 14 14:47:08 2015 UTC,The voice changes are not good. I really hope they change them for the DVD release
Animedubs,39ruj3,GibbsLAD,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:47:31 2015 UTC,I don't mind Issei's change as much as Akeno. Te original Akeno had this unique sad tone to her voice and the new actor doesn't even attempt to replicate it. Totally chages her character IMO hopefully they get the old actor back for the home release.
Animedubs,39ruj3,Djdray17,1 point,Sun Jun 14 15:48:58 2015 UTC,"Josh Grelle is great as Issei, but Akeno's VA isn't as sexy as the old one so Akeno isn't my favourite girl anymore. Asiaaaaaa."

Animedubs,39p4iy,burstdragon323,2,Sat Jun 13 11:40:27 2015 UTC,"It's not licensed as far as I can tell. The show finished 2 years ago and the license havn't been aquired yet so I'd say the chance of a dub is slim at this point, altough far from impossible. Shows have gone on for longer before getting dubbed."

Animedubs,39kotf,RayOfWill,10,Fri Jun 12 12:00:17 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty much only watching broadcast dubs right now.  Assassination Classroom: A pretty entertaining and funny show. I'm pretty excited about the next few episodes since it seems like   Seraph of the End: I think the only reason I'm watching this is because I like to watch Funi's DubbleTalk show. I'm not really liking the direction it went with the characters being in school after what seemed like a good setup in episode 1. I also don't like any of the characters except purple-haired girl.  Blood Blockade Battlefront: I don't really know what to say about it. It's funny at times, it's badass at times. The overarching story is pretty nonexistent. Kinda get a Cowboy Bebop feel from it, where every episode just has a thing the gang has to do, they do it, and then they never speak of it again.  Ninja Slayer: This is the best show ever. You need to watch this. It's hilarious. I absolutely adore the animation style too, where it goes between actual cool looking animation and basically slapping action figures together. It's so awesome.  The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki-chan: The Haruhi series is one of my favorite franchises ever, but the Yuki-chan manga didn't really do it for me. When I heard that this anime was getting made, I wasn't very excited, but the announcement that the original cast would be returning got me pretty pumped, if only to hear their voices doing something new. So far, I'm liking it. Tsuruya's stealing the show for me, though Haruhi is about to make her grand entrance in today's episode, which I'm looking forward to.  I also rewatched Puella Magi Madoka Magica over the last three days. I really liked it the first time around, but man, it's SO GOOD on a rewatch, when you can pick up on all the things you didn't understand on the first run. It's definitely one of the best narratives I've seen from anime. Now if only Aniplex didn't charge $160 for the series + Rebellion (which I haven't watched yet)."
Animedubs,39kotf,twinfyre,4,Fri Jun 12 16:12:12 2015 UTC,"Madoka Magica is slowly becoming my favorite show right now. I liked it a lot when I first saw it, but after rewatching it a lot of scenes really jumped out at me. Then I looked up the meaning of all of the runes and the symbolism on the wiki, and it really blew my mind. Seriously, if you ever have any time, look up the episodes and characters on the Madoka wiki. There's a lot of behind the scenes stuff that puts the characters in a new light. For example, try comparing Sayaka's story to the original version of the little mermaid.   And it goes even further. The Fridge section of Tv tropes is full of different brilliant things about the show.(I won't link tv tropes though, for fear of creating a black hole.)"
Animedubs,39kotf,RayOfWill,3,Sat Jun 13 05:32:26 2015 UTC,"I know! So many of character's lines especially stood out on a rewatch since you now already know what she went through. What seemed cryptic at first made perfect sense. It was awesome.  Also, I've already fallen in to tv tropes. How can I not read a fridge page? Farewell"
Animedubs,39kotf,Overlord3k,3,Sat Jun 13 13:57:39 2015 UTC,Now if only Aniplex didn't charge $160 for the series + Rebellion (which I haven't watched yet).   At least the movies were all recently added to Netflix so we got that going for us.  I have been thinking about getting around to watching Rebellion and your post is making me want to watch the first 2 movies first so I can 'rewatch' the series. I also have not fully watched the series dubbed so I guess I should take this opportunity to do so.
Animedubs,39kotf,TwistedBOLT,6,Sun Jun 14 09:57:23 2015 UTC,Clannad and Clannad afterstory uhhhh... I'm not done with afterstory (15 episodes in) but so far both are pretty meh IMO...
Animedubs,39kotf,Overlord3k,2,Fri Jun 12 16:28:14 2015 UTC,The anime? the dub? or both?
Animedubs,39kotf,TwistedBOLT,3,Sun Jun 14 09:13:09 2015 UTC,"Now that I've finished it I got to say that I rather found the 2nd season enjoyable... AKA I cried like a bitch on episode 20 when he goes back to his father. The dub was alright, I had no problems with it but the first season and half the 2nd one was just boring as hell to watch at least for me... So yeah... the dub was good..."
Animedubs,39kotf,Overlord3k,2,Sun Jun 14 09:24:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah it took me a long time to finish season 1. I would take breaks and just didn't feel like getting around to it. I had less of an issue with the 2nd season and I believe I finished it pretty quickly...might have even been in 1 or 2 sittings lol.   As for the dub I have only seen the first season dubbed still need to get around to watching the 2nd season dubbed. I don't dislike the dub I think it is pretty good but I definitely prefer the original cast for this series.  For me I lost it in ""cry in daddy's arms"".  Glad to at least hear that you thought the payoff was worth it and don't regret watching it all (at least that is what I assume)."
Animedubs,39kotf,pickelsurprise,4,Sun Jun 14 09:42:47 2015 UTC,"I recently watched the Sentai redub of Maid-Sama. I've never seen the original dub, but I've heard it was pretty bad. The redub was great in my opinion, with the humor and characters coming across nicely. The only con in my mind was it's another case of ""Monica Rial and David Matranga dub literally everything,"" but it didn't bother me in this case.  I also saw an advance screening of the first four episodes of Noragami. I haven't seen the rest of it yet, but I thought it was hysterical. A lot of new voices I hadn't heard before, but I thought they were all great. I'm definitely going to continue this one when I have a chance."
Animedubs,39kotf,Nynm,3,Fri Jun 12 12:53:34 2015 UTC,"Ooo, Noragami is dubbed? Awesome! I've been meaning to watch but didn't want to in JP since the subs go by so fast it was kind of annoying. Hope it's as funny as it looks~"
Animedubs,39kotf,LeSpanishRice,3,Fri Jun 12 15:34:22 2015 UTC,It's currently dubbed to episode 2 on funimation. Noragami i mean.

Animedubs,39kotf,MrReynevan2,4,Fri Jun 12 15:17:00 2015 UTC,"Assasination Classroom - Really entertaining show with unique plot, interesting characters and great dub. I really enjoy the series so far and I really hope it'll stay this way. I''s - I really enjoyed these first 2 episodes. Unfortunately the second series was kinda meh.  Flame of Recca - I expected it to be more like dragonball, but it's actually more similar to Yu Yu Hakusho. I like it. I also like the cast, because it's first time/in a long time I hear some of the voice actors."
Animedubs,39kotf,twinfyre,3,Fri Jun 12 23:43:28 2015 UTC,"I just saw Madoka Magica Rebellion with a couple friends of mine today. I didn't like the movie the first time I saw it, but it's really started to grow on me now. It's a lot like Memento. The more times you watch it, the more the pieces come together.   I love the art style and how Shaft really captured the dreamlike quality of the world. Architecture exists that shouldn't even stand up. Buildings seem to  go on forever in all directions. It's a style I've always wanted to draw in but never had the skills to do so.   Of course, the dub is incredible. Homura's VA does an excellent job. I almost teared up at a few parts."
Animedubs,39kotf,ScarRed_Tiger,3,Sat Jun 13 05:21:31 2015 UTC,"Finished Soul Eater Not! The returning cast slipped back into their characters really well. Especially Caitlynn Glass in a much more expanded role. The main girl Brynn April was quite good, her two costars were just okay. Her ""gigantus!""catchphrase did not translate well. Cute fluffy show that could occasionally shift into the darker elements of it's predecessor.  The DubbleTalk features continue to be excellent."
Animedubs,39kotf,0mfgroflmao,3,Fri Jun 12 22:12:36 2015 UTC,"Ping Pong the Animation 1-11/11  Been waiting for this and it did not disappoint, the animation style is strange but I got used to it pretty quick, the music was great and the characters really interesting, every anime fan should watch this, and now there's a dub so no excuse! high 9/10.  Baka and Test 1-13/13  Pretty entertaining and funny, but not quite as good as I was expecting 7/10.  Problem Children Are Coming From Another World, Aren't They? 1-10/10  Again, entertaining series but kinda glad it's only 10 episodes as I'm note sure I could do 24, MC was too OP imo. 7/10.  Kids on the Slope 1-12/12  Has this sitting around for ages and went into is knowing pretty much nothing and damn was it good! Anyone into the romance/ SOL side of anime should try this one. 9/10.  Durarara x2 1-12/12  Second season of Durarara, pretty good but not as good as the first season, looking forward to the next half! 8/10.  Is this a Zombie? Season 1+2  Kinda ridiculous but hilarious, interesting characters and plenty of laughs. 8/10.  Say ""I Love You"" 1-13/13  Good romance story, really connected to the MC as I'm a total recluse as well. 8/10.  Also been keeping up with some of Funimations broadcast dubs, Seraph of the end, AssClass, Blood Blockade, Otaku Teacher and Nagato. Liking all of them so far with Seraph probably being my least favorite, the first ep was really interesting but it seems they're now going for a high school romcom or something, hope that changes."
Animedubs,39kotf,twinfyre,3,Fri Jun 12 23:19:15 2015 UTC,I've heard a lot of things about ping pong. Maybe I'll have to check it out soon. I hope it gets added to netflix.

Animedubs,39jrer,Ianjh,2,Fri Jun 12 05:44:26 2015 UTC,"I imagine Yuri Lowenthal for Twelve, Josh Grelle also works. For Twelve my guess is JYB with a voice similar to Lelouch from Code Geass. Jamieson Price is who I think could work as the voice for Shibazaki."
Animedubs,39jrer,Ianjh,2,Fri Jun 12 05:58:07 2015 UTC,THATS EXACTY WHAT I WAS THINKING!  It was his Lelouch voice that made me consider him in the first place.  Todd Haberkorn has a similar sound to JYB's Lelouch voice which is why I put him down as well.  And Yuri Lowenthal for Twelve would be perfect.  You put Twelve twice though so did you mean JYB as Nine and Lowenthal or Grelle as Twelve?
Animedubs,39jrer,Ianjh,2,Fri Jun 12 06:06:29 2015 UTC,JYB as Nine. Was replying quickly to get back to something else and didn't notice that.

It was centered around a few girls that were training to become meisters and weapon, but had a lot of cake eating and girls doing girly things and very little combat."
Animedubs,39ddc3,cerb20,1 point,Thu Jun 11 09:09:54 2015 UTC,It's a lot more light hearted and is more formatted to be a slice of life type of show comparitively.

Animedubs,392xhs,The-Sublimer-One,2,Mon Jun 8 21:52:11 2015 UTC,Multitasking is very important in 21st century.
Animedubs,392xhs,MrReynevan2,21,Mon Jun 8 21:48:22 2015 UTC,Dubs are superior because you can get immersed in the anime a lot more I find.  When you are watching subbed you have to take your eyes off whatever is happening at the time and read.  We have more than one sense why not use them?  When I watch dubbed I can always appreciate the art work way more then when I watch subbed.
Animedubs,392xhs,crazyminner,0,Mon Jun 8 21:54:35 2015 UTC,You can always learn Japanese just to watch raw anime ;d
Animedubs,392xhs,MrReynevan2,12,Mon Jun 8 22:01:42 2015 UTC,"I would honestly understand the dub hate more if the 'purist' anime fans were into raw anime, learning Japanese and all would actually be hardcore. But noo, they're pro-sub. I understand some would prefer one over the other, but why would they look down on me for wanting to experience Anime the same as other forms of visual media.  People say dubs sometimes suck but subs often suck too. I guess you could keep looking until you found 'good' subs for some animes but cmon."
Animedubs,392xhs,staindk,3,Mon Jun 8 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It makes little to no sense to me. I keep pointing it out to my friend, but doesn't even want to consider what I just said to him..."
Animedubs,392xhs,MrReynevan2,4,Mon Jun 8 22:30:05 2015 UTC,I'm the only person I know who watches dubs and those I know who do watch anime look at me like I'm crazy.  For what?  Wanting to enjoy the art and animation without having to fixate my eyes towards the bottom of the screen for 20 minutes?
Animedubs,392xhs,C-Dub1980,8,Tue Jun 9 03:44:41 2015 UTC,"I assure you they are the vocal minority (sub elitist).   Anyways I watch whatever happens to be available, though vastly prefer dubs, as it allows me/frees me to explore the scenery and landscapes that are created by the staff. You just can't really get that if you're constantly reading the dialogue, especially if it's a dialogue heavy show, it takes you away from the immersion of the atmosphere that is being set."
Animedubs,392xhs,yolo-yoshi,8,Mon Jun 8 22:20:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, I do a lot of reading and writing in my graduate English class currently.  So when I do get the chance to watch anime, I would rather listen and rest my mind over more reading.  So in essence, I watch dubs over subs sometimes because it is a nice break from what I do a lot of already.  This was the same way when I was in college, I had too many English assignments at times and readings to do.  There are other reasons but this is my main reason."
Animedubs,392xhs,Jormundura,7,Mon Jun 8 22:46:26 2015 UTC,"Two reasons.   I grew up watching dubs, and the first anime I've watched (consciously, when I was 16) was Yu-Gi-Oh, because I wanted to get into anime, so I picked dubbed version. What's the better way to get into anime than picking something you've watched as a child, right? ... right? The second reason is my eyesight. I don't really like reading subs, because it's can be really distracting. I'm blind in one eye, and have some problems with the other, so reading subs and paying attention to the rest can be difficult at times."
Animedubs,392xhs,MrReynevan2,6,Mon Jun 8 21:47:11 2015 UTC,"I read slowly and want to pay attention to the stuff on screen, so it's either dub or pause every two seconds.  I'm serious. I watched each episode of Mayou Maou Yusha over 40 minutes because of it."
Animedubs,392xhs,WildCharger,7,Mon Jun 8 23:01:43 2015 UTC,I have trouble identifying with characters who are not speaking English
Animedubs,392xhs,frostingchain,8,Mon Jun 8 22:23:16 2015 UTC,"When watching subbed stuff, I honestly forget that they are speaking Japanese sometimes."
Animedubs,392xhs,Kafke,5,Tue Jun 9 02:18:45 2015 UTC,"Aside from actually wanting to watch and listen, I think some of the VA's have been really fantastic for a while now, it feels a lot more involved for me, I also like noticing voices and seeing what else they are in."
Animedubs,392xhs,Theskian,7,Tue Jun 9 00:17:05 2015 UTC,"I like to watch my movies, not read them."
Animedubs,392xhs,Captain_Harlock,5,Tue Jun 9 00:18:39 2015 UTC,"Unless you understand Japanese, there's a lot you lose in subbed shows. The simple fact that you can't always tell how a character is supposed to be talking (subtle sarcasm can be hard to detect, for example) is a big downside. Being able to fully understand the emotions behind the voice is nice. There ARE also times where the subs aren't always clear, the Cowboy Bebop subs I have in particular can make it hard to tell what character is talking during a scene, unless you're great as mesmerizing the voices of 1 episode characters that don't speak your language.  Puns and cultural references can't be translated a lot of the time, and if I have to keep pausing to read TL notes (which I do like) the anime loses steam. Dubs will usually make the jokes more clear, or change them so they make sense. Seitokai Yakuindomo is a great example of how a LOT of jokes will be left untranslated or translated incorrectly. Season 2, episode 11 has some joke in the first few seconds comparing a guy's ""rod"" to a fishing rod, but all 3 of my subs for that episode tell the joke completely differently, and not one of them tells it well. A dub would have the effort to make the joke actually make sense on it's own. This also adds unity to the fanbase, because if the show was dubbed, EVERYONE would have heard the same joke. If two people read different subs, they'll see slightly different jokes.  Bakemonogatari is a great anime, but there is so much talking and so many references to so many things that a normal person isn't going to be able to catch them all even if they DO understand the language. It's also a great example of how looking at the subs for the long and fast speeches WILL make you miss visual jokes and gags, as anyone who rewatches the show should see.  Being able to see the full screen 100% of the time is good too, even if subs don't cover that much or require you to look at them too long. Some fansubbers move the subs in weird ways to avoid covering boobs or fanservice and other similar things, but a dub doesn't need to worry about that in the first place.  I don't dislike subs, and I greatly prefer them in some cases, (like in The World God Only Knows and Higurashi) but dubs just simplify things and make them easier to understand for people who aren't huge otaku."
Animedubs,392xhs,thegooblop,4,Tue Jun 9 01:12:41 2015 UTC,"To add to that, I've noticed a specific way in which dubs convey information better.  A sentence can have many different meanings depending on what word is stressed. ""I didn't eat his sandwich"" can have five different meanings depending on the word on which emphasis is placed. But if that was in Japanese and subbed, you wouldn't necessarily know what it meant because languages can have vastly different grammar. So if the word that is stressed is the hypothetical word ""fnarg"", you wouldn't actually know what meaning it was meant to have. But when it's dubbed, and it turns out that ""his"" was the word that was dubbed, then you can actually understand it. Many similar subtleties simply can't be conveyed if you have to divide the meaning between the voice and the written words."

I have a Lumia 521 now so I think it would be a bit too small to watch anime on, but I'm looking to upgrade to something bigger later this year.

Animedubs,392xhs,CanvasWolfDoll,2,Tue Jun 9 01:22:51 2015 UTC,"well, with the rise of streaming services, often you only get the subbed version. it'd be nice to have the option, but nooo, it's cheaper to only get one license, and subs land first."
Animedubs,392xhs,razorlikeblue,4,Tue Jun 9 03:35:33 2015 UTC,Yeah for the most part that's the case . Broadcast dubs are on the rise though for better or worse .
Animedubs,392xhs,Kafke,3,Tue Jun 9 03:58:22 2015 UTC,"I watch dubs because:  ""Talk to a man in a language he knows, and he receives it with his brain. Talk to a man in his native tongue, and he receives it with his heart.""  Or whatever that quote is. Dubs just hit harder, and generally work a lot better for drama type shows in my opinion. Along with shows that require you to keep your eyes glued to the screen.  It's much more relaxing to simply listen, rather than read.  I don't actually prefer dubs. I prefer whatever is the best. Some subs are awful, and some dubs are awful. Depends on the show, really.  Something like Haruhi or Baccano I'd never be able to watch in Japanese/subbed. But with something like Steins;Gate or Mirai Nikki, I can't stand the dubs.  Just all depends, really."
Animedubs,392xhs,The-Sublimer-One,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:17:18 2015 UTC,"But with something like Steins;Gate or Mirai Nikki, I can't stand the dubs.   That's surprising to me. Many consider the dubs for those shows to be extremely well done, especially the MC voices. S;G because J. Michael Tatum is fucking amazing, and MN because Yukki actually sounds like a guy."
Animedubs,392xhs,Kafke,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:00:38 2015 UTC,"For S;G, the MC is what mainly bothers me. He sounds so off. The sub is just too good, and there's a lot of content I can't imagine would work well in the dub (I'm mad scientist. Is so cooool! Sunuvabitch!)  As for MN, just.... ugh. No."
Animedubs,392xhs,Stardweller,2,Tue Jun 9 22:17:24 2015 UTC,So I can multitask.  Plus emotion is more understandable.  Goku and Yusuke Urameshi are my prime examples.  Jap Goku doesn't stir anything inside of me.  No goosebumps.
Animedubs,392xhs,Saint_Sin,2,Tue Jun 9 01:37:03 2015 UTC,"I can not say i prefer them wholly, however i do tend to watch them or even look out for good ones often.  Generally because i dont like having to keep my eyes utterly glued to and focused upon the screen constantly."
Animedubs,392xhs,hydrosphere13,2,Tue Jun 9 03:19:16 2015 UTC,I like dubs cause I can focus on the action and what's actually happening and being said. Not pausing/rewinding to see what someone said. And this may sound racist but I just don't like the high pitch most japanese dubs have.
Animedubs,392xhs,NightmarePulse,2,Tue Jun 9 04:02:37 2015 UTC,"I also need to be able to do other things. ADHD demands that I multitask. It is also a different experience to hear words that you understand, and I do not know Japanese."
Animedubs,392xhs,Pikagreg,2,Tue Jun 9 04:44:18 2015 UTC,"I watch a lot of both and find myself never remembering names when I watch a show in Japanese. I can tell you everything about a character, what their motivations are, and not know their name.  This also happened to a friend of mine when I tried to get him to watch Gurren Lagann. It was shortly after Netflix lost it's streaming rights and we ended up watching it on Crunchyroll subbed. He did not know the mighty Kamina's name until near the end of the series."
Animedubs,392xhs,GoodSirMatthew_2,2,Tue Jun 9 07:07:55 2015 UTC,"I prefer dubs because reading subtitles takes away from the experience of the show whether that be a fight or a funny joke.   Also,  when you're reading subtitles you sorta create your own in your head of what these characters would sound like in English. Dub VAs makes it all easier and do a kick ass job"
Animedubs,392xhs,brightblueinky,2,Tue Jun 9 07:27:14 2015 UTC,"It's a mix of few things. One is that I just absorb information better when I hear it than when I read it (to the point that I often will read out loud to myself when studying), so I can remember plot details and the like a little better.  The other is I like hearing/seeing different takes on the characters from different characters. I like watching both versions and seeing the different choices made in each ones. Like seeing a Japanese voice actor deciding to be more reserved while the American chooses to be a bit more emotional, or how the writers of the dub deal with cultural differences--stuff like puns, voice archetypes we don't really have, even some of the REALLY out there stuff like the Romeo x Juliet dub deciding to try to not just write the lines in Shakespearean English but, when possible, to actually do it in iambic pentameter....I've always been the sort of person that's enjoyed seeing different takes on stuff I like, so it's fun! Like watching multiple different productions of the same play, or a retelling of a fairytale set in WWII, or fanart of Steampunk Disney characters or whatever. It intrigues me."
Animedubs,392xhs,Elethor,2,Tue Jun 9 07:38:45 2015 UTC,Well it started out as a natural choice since English is the only language I speak. However as I started to watch more and more anime I started to become a big fan of some of the voice actors and I now watch dubs for their acting as much as for the language.
Animedubs,392xhs,Angrymuffin16,2,Tue Jun 9 08:54:50 2015 UTC,"I prefer dubs for many different reasons. For one, I can look away from the screen without missing vital things you need to read. Two, usually I feel for the show a lot more if it's spoken in English. I guess I just understand it better that way. Three, I get easily sidetracked and can't focus all too well, so sometimes when watching subs, it gets confusing. Also, I don't think you get the full effect of the anime when it's subbed. Just because you might be little things going on, while reading the subtitles.  And another reason I watch dubbed is because there's certain English VAs I just love and like to watch the ones they're in."
Animedubs,392xhs,Mistaken_Stranger,2,Tue Jun 9 08:58:17 2015 UTC,"If I'm going to read, I'd much rather it be a book/graphic novel."
Animedubs,392xhs,Coolquip34,2,Tue Jun 9 13:01:32 2015 UTC,I like to drink and watch anime the more I drink the slower I get when reading subs and I have to pause sometimes haha. Seriously though I just like dubs more. I don't have to glance down constantly. Depending on their location the characters can have an appropriate accent. For the most part I have no issues with the voices. I think my only issue with dubs is that sometimes the english voice actors lack the passion of the Japanese ones. Which I understand can be hard to match when you're trying to time mouth flaps. So it's not that big of a deal.
Animedubs,392xhs,superange128,2,Tue Jun 9 14:20:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I just enjoy voice acting. When you see mid-90s voice acting anime I can see why the distaste developed (I remember even Crispin Freeman saying they were horrible) but dubs anymore are pretty solid. If, for example, we had dubs like Fairy Tail or even Naruto in the 90s instead I think they wouldnt be as looked down on."
Animedubs,392xhs,The-Sublimer-One,2,Wed Jun 10 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"Outside a few Japanese VAs, since I'm more familiar with the English language, it's easier for particularly good (or bad) performances to stick out to me.  While I don't mind watching subs and do it kinda often, I feel like watching dubs is closer to how a Japanese person watches their anime (aka without having to look at words while watching, especially in action anime).  I think a lot of the work that goes into making English dubs is very underrated. Sure some dubs in the past were kinda bad but many of them have been done very well recently (especially Funi or California dubs).  Surprised to see lots of multi-taskers here though, I personally can't fully enjoy or get immersed into anime (dub or sub) if I'm doing something else while watching."

I'm the same way. Even if it's something as simple as checking a Skype message, I'll have to pause the dubbed anime and come back to it. It's like I have a concussion or something and can only focus on one thing at a time."
Animedubs,392xhs,orphicdragon,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:02:36 2015 UTC,"I like to watch the dubs for the accents the russians, german, and british.  Are a great add on for the humor that you don't get with subs. Also many of the male VA in the original sounds to much like girls or tranny, which is just annoying when they're trying to be a bad ass."
Animedubs,392xhs,Beefdagetti,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:05:03 2015 UTC,"I have ADD and am too old to learn how to watch and read a movie at the same time.  I wish I was being funny. I ""watch"" a movie in bits and pieces. I'm always doing something else I just can't like sit and watch a movie or TV. I usually put it on repeat and after its played through 2 or 3 times I've seen and or heard it all, or at least enough to know whats going on and the plot.   I've tried to sit and watch and read subs and it was just...pathetic. I felt like Eva in Igor strapped to the chair.   English or nothing for me. I'll just deal with the scorn of the ""pure"" anime crowd.  Probably doesn't help that I'm 'Murican and kinda have a xenophobic mindset. I certainly don't hate other cultures buuuuut I'm not really interested in them either. Other countries seem to breed more interest in learning outside things more than we do.   Murica is best, even when it pretty clearly isn't the best. I was indoctrinated well in our public skewls.    What do I get out of dubbed anime? Basically I get the Japanese out of it. Oh and I get to make all the purest gnash their teeth and rage. :)"

ADV's dubbed version retains the basic plot structure and storyline, but alters much of the dialogue into comedy written by ADV screenwriter Steven Foster and ad-libbed by the voice actors.The original Japanese audio and literal subtitle translation are also included on the DVD. The dub received favorable reviews and the original Japanese licensor, Aniplex, approved the changes.[citation needed] Volume one of Ghost Stories went on sale on October 22, 2005.  On August 28, 2013 Discotek Media announced that they licensed the series and would release it in 2014 with the ADV dub and the Japanese audio with English subtitles.The entire series was released on a 3 Disc set on March 25, 2014. straight from WIKI ."

The reason why there's such a long wait is because they're waiting on the Japanese licencors with the home video materials of each show (which is why a show that doesn't get broadcast dubbed but is still released dubbed later takes so long to come out). Plus occasionally these home video versions of episodes might differ to what was broadcast (e.g. extra scenes, cleaned animation) which would necessitate a redub."

Animedubs,38n082,anonymepelle,2,Fri Jun 5 07:32:18 2015 UTC,Is that the order you are supposed to watch (the first bullet point)? I have actually avoided it because I wasn't sure.
Animedubs,38n082,GibbsLAD,3,Fri Jun 5 08:31:16 2015 UTC,"There are two ways to watch it. Original broadcast order or chronological order. The concept at the beginning was that one of the characters of the series had jumbled up the broadcast order of the episodes of the first season to tell the story the way she wanted it told. But this was before they desided to make sequels so they later changed the order of the episodes back to chronological for the dvds and when they re-aired the show back in 2009 so it would be easier for people to follow the over arching story. Therefore I'd say that chronological order probably works a little better just for the state the series is right now, since it helps set up more the plot points that leads in to the movie.  It's worth mentioning that there are a lot of episodes in season 2 that takes place in the time inbetween episodes of season 1.  But either way works,  As long as you watch episode 00 either last or right after season 1 it doesn't really matter all that much.  Here's a list of the different watching orders  Column B is the original broadcast order.  Column E is chronological order (season 1 and 2 mixed together acording to when the events take place).  And column C is chronological order within the seasons. So season 1 chronological order followed by season 2 chronoligical order.  I'd recomend watching it either acording to column E or C. But like I said. All options are fine, it doesn't matter all that much."
Animedubs,38n082,anonymepelle,2,Fri Jun 5 08:47:21 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ, thanks."

Animedubs,38n082,anonymepelle,2,Fri Jun 5 08:56:37 2015 UTC,"I see Baccano! is on your watchlist... would you say The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is less/more twisted than Baccano as far as the timeline goes? I kept up with Baccano pretty well, but don't think I could handle something much more jumbled than that.  If the arching plot is any good, I'd prefer to watch it in order probably, but since that means watching out of release order... are there big spoilers or something that I'll run into If I watch it in chronological order?"
Animedubs,38n082,thegooblop,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:13:18 2015 UTC,"Haruhi is not as plotty as Baccano is. It's more of an episodic show with some overarcing plot threads binding it together. Which is why the watching order doesn't really matter all that much, since you'll probably be able to keep track of the overarcing stuff regardless. Spoilers isn't really an issue since all the plot threads just ends up setting up stuff that gets explored more in the movie. It isn't a plot that's very easy to get spoiled on. You'll probably be able to guess exactly where things are going from the very beginning, it's not very suprising. It's more about the characters than the plot.  Baccano is definitly more dificult to keep track of than Haruhi is."

I also recommend you read the Haganai LNs. 9.4/10 of the LNs are translated and they're amazing. In fact I started reading the LNs directly after the first season, I'm yet to watch the second season."
Animedubs,38n082,Cyclonedx,2,Fri Jun 5 10:06:27 2015 UTC,Baka to Testo Seto no Hanayome Binbougami ga!   Edit: Baka and Test; My Bride is a Mermaid; Good Luck Girl
Animedubs,38n082,MrReynevan2,1 point,Fri Jun 5 21:52:13 2015 UTC,Good Luck Girl is so good. Sadly it didn't get a 2nd season but there is always the manga.
Animedubs,38n082,Overlord3k,2,Sat Jun 6 02:17:23 2015 UTC,Yeah... If it only was LN... I'd rather read LN than manga.
Animedubs,38n082,MrReynevan2,2,Sat Jun 6 13:32:13 2015 UTC,School Rumble!
Animedubs,38n082,brandy1234,2,Fri Jun 5 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"Here are some recommendations:  The Devil is a Part Timer! Is more of a traditional comedy  B Gata H Kei is more sexually driven jokes and the story relates to that, but it's still very funny  Heaven's Lost Property is also sexually driven but unlike B Gata H Kei, has harem elements and is way more in your face with fan service. There are two seasons and two movies of this, though the second movie (finale) wasn't very good, and the plot becomes more of a focus as it goes on.   The dub is really good for the first two, and good but not great for the third one, just as an FYI in case that's how you normally watch"
Animedubs,38kyla,UniversalX1,6,Thu Jun 4 21:59:03 2015 UTC,"It says English Trailer, but no one speaks English lol :( hope they release the dub at the same time :)"
Animedubs,38kyla,Overlord3k,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:13:07 2015 UTC,I don't see why they wouldn't they did so last time. Plus it will probably also come with a Spanish dub lol.
Animedubs,38kyla,wardaniel9,5,Sat Jun 6 02:05:29 2015 UTC,"Is it going to be dub, first season was dub from the beginning..."
Animedubs,38kyla,JRPictures,3,Thu Jun 4 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"Awesome, really enjoyed the first season and was looking forward to this.  And I just checked the S2 trailer on the show's Netflix page and the one line at the start is said in English, so yeah it is dubbed."
Animedubs,38kyla,imnothatguy,2,Fri Jun 5 05:08:01 2015 UTC,First season was awesome.  Can barely wait :)  :/
Animedubs,38kyla,whitegangster400,1 point,Thu Jun 4 22:54:08 2015 UTC,Are they going to release all of season 2 at once?
Animedubs,38kyla,anonymepelle,2,Fri Jun 5 04:34:23 2015 UTC,I imagine so. That's what they did for season 1 and that's what netflix usually do unless they are forced not to by the original studio.

Animedubs,38hjcd,kinght6,10,Thu Jun 4 06:38:29 2015 UTC,Sentai Filmworks licensed semi popular anime revolved around action and cute girls? I'd say it's a fair shot.
Animedubs,38hjcd,anonymepelle,2,Thu Jun 4 07:39:53 2015 UTC,what really? and they rarely dub animes. so it not a high chance.
Animedubs,38hjcd,rjc523,5,Thu Jun 4 11:04:30 2015 UTC,"They usually dub their more popular shows (like Love Chunibyou and soon-to-be Parasyte, for example) and this show seems popular enough to get the dub treatment"
Animedubs,38hjcd,superange128,1 point,Thu Jun 4 17:22:03 2015 UTC,i can't wait for s2 of chunibyou and maybe.
Animedubs,38hjcd,rjc523,3,Sat Jun 6 21:05:22 2015 UTC,Certainly.  It's far too popular to bring over as a sub only release.  Although the initial release might be one of those dvd only sub only releases that make us all wait a year for the good version.
Animedubs,38hjcd,shizknight,2,Thu Jun 4 17:20:24 2015 UTC,i hope so. it looks and sounds cool and funny lol.

Animedubs,38f6mj,JefferyUchiha,4,Wed Jun 3 20:29:25 2015 UTC,Theoretically: Evangelion 3.33 and The Boy and the Beast.  But neither have official english release dates yet.  Expelled from paradise comes out this month. See sidebar for info.
Animedubs,38f6mj,anonymepelle,3,Wed Jun 3 20:49:24 2015 UTC,I just wish someone grows some balls and dubs the garden of sinners franchise... Seriously why the hell is it still not dubbed?
Animedubs,38f6mj,TwistedBOLT,2,Thu Jun 4 00:15:11 2015 UTC,"I just watched Expelled from Paradise via Netflix (US):  Overall, a pretty solid sci-fi action flick, with an English dub that was of good quality to watch. Steve Blum and Johnny Yong Bosch work well in their respective roles, but Wendee Lee sounded a little miscast, since she doesn't normally voice Tsundere-ish characters.  Another anime movie dub that's coming soon (late July, to be precise) is 009 Re:Cyborg. just like Expelled from Paradise, it's a CG movie that's stylized to resemble traditional hand-drawn animation. Based on the trailers and synopsis, it seems like a decent entry point to the 009 franchise, and could be easily enjoyed in either Japanese or English.  Oh, and I also believe the latest DBZ movie is gonna have a limited theatrical run in August, similar to Battle of Gods last year."
Animedubs,38f6mj,pterynxli,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:06:55 2015 UTC,"Oh cool, didn't realize Expelled from Paradise is on Netflix, will be adding it to my list!"
Animedubs,38f6mj,0mfgroflmao,2,Wed Jun 3 22:13:51 2015 UTC,"Also: all 3 Madoka Magica movies, in dual audio, have been added to Netflix as well. They were already released with dubs included beforehand (including Rebellion back in April), but Netflix is more affordable as a legal means to watch them."
Animedubs,38dec0,MrReynevan2,6,Wed Jun 3 14:18:42 2015 UTC,"There's really no news on that front.  There are rumours going around that Netflix licenced the show (like they did with Knights of Sidonia), which means they would be dubbing it. But there hasn't been any confirmation on who even licenced the show at this point."
Animedubs,38dec0,JRPictures,3,Wed Jun 3 14:51:46 2015 UTC,i hope it gets dubbed lol.
Animedubs,38dec0,rjc523,3,Wed Jun 3 16:04:30 2015 UTC,It;s sad...

Animedubs,38dec0,rjc523,2,Wed Jun 3 18:26:02 2015 UTC,i hope it gets dubbed. it looks cool and funny lol.
Animedubs,38dec0,zSoulweaver,2,Wed Jun 3 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really is.  It would be awesome material for long-running shounen, but there isn't enough volumes for this. Shame.  it's an awesome story, and I can't believe that it doesn't have the dub already. Take Absolute Duo for example, why did it get a dub? It's kinda nothing special..."
Animedubs,38dec0,Overlord3k,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:29:10 2015 UTC,"http://worldanimeclub.com/thoughts-n-theories/nanatsu-no-taizai-season-2-will-it-happen/  Probably wont be long running. Seems Japan didn't like it, so I doubt we'll be getting a S2. But who knows."
Animedubs,38dec0,rjc523,1 point,Thu Jun 4 07:34:49 2015 UTC,Ehh just looking at the tv rankings isn't a good idea to see how a series is doing. The manga is selling a lot to the point where it was the #1 selling manga for the first half of 2015 (barely beating One Piece) and the #9 best selling manga from 2014. Also the anime bluray/dvd sales have been pretty good.  It wouldn't surprise me if we see a 2nd season in a few years when there is enough manga content.
Animedubs,38dec0,rjc523,1 point,Sat Jun 6 02:55:04 2015 UTC,what really? and it nothing special? haven't seen it since i'm waiting for uncensored/uncut version before i watch it. but it looks and sounds cool to me.
Animedubs,38dec0,rjc523,1 point,Sat Jun 6 21:06:41 2015 UTC,"Absolute Duo is avarage. I gave it a chance, but it was rather disappointing. I might try rewatching it on holidays though, so maybe, just maybe my opinion will change. Aaand there are always Light Novels"

Animedubs,3860ox,We-Are-Harbinger,7,Tue Jun 2 16:08:03 2015 UTC,if you are just finishing the series skip the first two movies as they are recaps and then watch the third movie. Rebellion is a new story.
Animedubs,3860ox,We-Are-Harbinger,3,Tue Jun 2 17:21:57 2015 UTC,Thanks! I'll keep that in mind.

Animedubs,383m6y,anonymepelle,10,Mon Jun 1 16:45:17 2015 UTC,"I just watched Michiko & Hatchin not too long ago, I liked it. I'll probably watch it again.  I don't know about Akame Ga Kill! first impression from reading MAL is it looks kinda lame.  Does this mean Inuyasha will have an ending?"
Animedubs,383m6y,old_po_blu_collar,4,Mon Jun 1 18:57:52 2015 UTC,I started Akame Ga Kill. I stopped mainly because it got too fucked up. Unrealistically fucked up for anime. I loved the take on human nature but some plot points was derived from absolute stupidity.
Animedubs,383m6y,wolfflame21,3,Mon Jun 1 20:10:10 2015 UTC,"Really? I mean its pretty bloody but isn't all action type anime like that? I thought that it had very well done action scenes, and they decently developed enough of the characters, though mc is generic as fuck. Overall I'd its an above average watch. Is nothing special, but it entertained me."
Animedubs,383m6y,my_name_is_the_DUDE,2,Tue Jun 2 01:56:19 2015 UTC,Samurai Champloo which is an action show is not like that. At all.
Animedubs,383m6y,wolfflame21,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:24:55 2015 UTC,Samurai Champloo does have gore in it as well its just not as excessive as Akame Ga Kill. And I'd also argue thats its a bit unfair to compare a classic like Samurai Champloo to a seasonal favorite like Akame Ga Kill.
Animedubs,383m6y,my_name_is_the_DUDE,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:26:14 2015 UTC,But you just compared all action type anime to Akame Ga Kill. One Piece is an action show. As far as I can tell it is not as brutal.
Animedubs,383m6y,wolfflame21,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:43:12 2015 UTC,That is a shounen its a different genre. Akame Ga Kill is a seinen.

Animedubs,383m6y,kooger2439,3,Mon Jun 1 22:50:16 2015 UTC,Oh cool Akame ga Kill is one of the shows I would consider watching if it got dubbed

Animedubs,383m6y,ughzean,3,Mon Jun 1 22:07:56 2015 UTC,prepare for them censors. I was surprised they aired black lagoon on there at one point lol. So many bleeps.
Animedubs,383m6y,hydrosphere13,3,Mon Jun 1 18:57:00 2015 UTC,"They can apparently get away with a lot more now. Kill la Kill is dropping ""shit"", ""asshole"", and ""goddamn"" constantly, all left un-bleeped. Looks like ""fuck"" is really the only thing they can't say on the air."
Animedubs,383m6y,Sea-Salt,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:07:34 2015 UTC,I actually find the bleeps pretty funny... I might even go as fas as saying that if the only thing they censure is the sound I enjoy the show more... but I think that's going to far. Worst case scenario I don't really mind it that much.
Animedubs,383m6y,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Tue Jun 2 00:04:00 2015 UTC,Oh I love bleeps too but every other word in Black Lagoon was bleeped out. Was amazingly hilarious.
Animedubs,383m6y,hydrosphere13,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:05:41 2015 UTC,The more it's used the less funny it becomes... eventually it just gets irritating. Black lagoons dub is too good to censure.
Animedubs,383m6y,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:09:07 2015 UTC,True that but it was pretty funny it how much they censored BL to get it to air on Toonami. They've also censored other shows for minor stuff as well.
Animedubs,383m6y,hydrosphere13,3,Tue Jun 2 01:11:02 2015 UTC,Akame ga kill was recommended to me by the buckets. Can't wait to finally see what's it about... even if it is disappointing...
Animedubs,383m6y,TwistedBOLT,2,Tue Jun 2 00:05:08 2015 UTC,Michiko & hatchin was awesome. Really liked it.
Animedubs,383m6y,Leightonian,1 point,Tue Jun 2 03:30:45 2015 UTC,OK.  Now how about you try to not keep on skipping weeks with One Piece since you're almost 200 hundred episodes behind the DVDs.

Animedubs,37ru18,NeonFangX,6,Fri May 29 21:47:10 2015 UTC,I really hate spoilers in the opening even showing how a character that we didn't meet casts a spell or performs some move ruins my experience when that's suppose to happen in the show itself. Usually when I watch something the first time I watch the opening because I have no idea what's going on so I don't remember any of the characters or the things they did in the opening. Then every episode after that I tab out of the video and just listen to the openings music until it changes (or the series ends) and then I go to the previous episode and watch the full opening. Honestly I usually forget and there are a lot of good openings that don't spoil anything but heh... I think my way is worth it.  About endings... well unless the song (and video) is REEEEEEEEEEEALLY friggen good good (it was the first thing that popped to mind) I usually just skip it and watch the next episode. 99.99% (pretty sure there's at least one that dies it... but I didn't watch it) of times they don't spoil anything so it's alright to watch them.
Animedubs,37ru18,TwistedBOLT,3,Sat May 30 10:26:19 2015 UTC,"Yes. If I had looked up the lyrics for the Clannad After Story opening before I watched it, I would have been pissed."
Animedubs,37ru18,Codee33,2,Sat May 30 11:07:36 2015 UTC,"YES! I had the exact same react to Seraph of the end.   An OP should set up the pacing and setting of a show, but show it giving as little story clues as possible.   Maybe the opening adds in scenes as the series progresses. So as the story is revealed the opening for each episode will become longer and more detailed, while also serving as a recap of everything that has happened so far throughout the show."
Animedubs,37ru18,TheGamerGrant,2,Sat May 30 03:10:38 2015 UTC,"I'm a little new to anime, but what does OP  stand for in this context?"
Animedubs,37ru18,Clannad-Feelchair,1 point,Sat May 30 03:29:15 2015 UTC,Opening; the song at the start of the episode
Animedubs,37ru18,vgbm,1 point,Sat May 30 03:54:59 2015 UTC,Opening. Aka The Song part. It almost always shows the characters in a montage from some point in the show. But sometimes they show a little too much and reveal some kind of plot point.
Animedubs,37ru18,qodzero,2,Sat May 30 03:56:38 2015 UTC,"I usually save the OP's and ED's until after I finish a series, unless I'm watching something like a SOL that probably wouldn't have big spoilersin the OP/ED.   I'm only OK with spoilers if they're done in a symbolic way or likely won't be seen as spoilers, like in the OP of Future Diary and Baccano! , both of which have a spoiler you wouldn't recognize as a spoiler until you see the reveal."
Animedubs,37ru18,thegooblop,2,Sat May 30 04:39:43 2015 UTC,"One Piece's third opening had a huge spoiler for the next crew member who would join. And not like how the original five were shown in the original opening, because in each one of their arcs, it was obvious that they'd join. This was a crew member who was a complete surprise. So I even tell people watching One Piece to skip the intro until they finish that arc. It's certainly a problem."
Animedubs,37ru18,potentialPizza,1 point,Sat May 30 16:15:24 2015 UTC,"It is the same with the next episode previews.  I mean, dont get me wrong, i know it is supposed to be a preview.  But its not that hard to not include any of the visually obvious spoiler scenes."
Animedubs,37ru18,Saint_Sin,1 point,Sat May 30 14:56:50 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately it's a thing that's not going away.

Animedubs,37j3ii,razorlikeblue,10,Thu May 28 00:17:57 2015 UTC,Shark McShark must be one talented guy! /s
Animedubs,37j3ii,0mfgroflmao,9,Thu May 28 00:38:03 2015 UTC,"Shark McShark better be an alias for ""oh man you guys were scared we wouldn't get everyone back, we sure got you good"""
Animedubs,37j3ii,Matoro6,2,Thu May 28 02:00:28 2015 UTC,And it was! :D
Animedubs,37j3ii,Bloodcake,3,Thu May 28 16:33:39 2015 UTC,what a weird time...2:10
Animedubs,37j3ii,Clannad-Feelchair,3,Thu May 28 06:49:10 2015 UTC,Most people will be at work or school so yeah I agree .
Animedubs,37j3ii,Piker10,2,Thu May 28 06:50:18 2015 UTC,i was just thinking about this. good to know we got a date now
Animedubs,37j3ii,notorious2122,2,Thu May 28 02:33:45 2015 UTC,"Thank goodness. It now lists the whole cast is back. The only characters VA not mentioned is who is playing Koizumi, who I'm sure doesn't have much lines anyways.   I liked that Funi kinda trolled the fans with this, pretty funny with the Shark McShark and waiting so long to reveal it."
Animedubs,37j3ii,twinfyre,2,Thu May 28 16:53:17 2015 UTC,Still I hope they get Johnny yong Bosch back. I can't really see anyone else playing the part for koizumi.
Animedubs,37j3ii,superange128,2,Thu May 28 17:38:59 2015 UTC,Just noticed this and saw Chris Sabat's tweet.  Now even more excited to check the show out.
Animedubs,37j3ii,IonicSounds,1 point,Thu May 28 18:20:03 2015 UTC,Are these simulcasts free? Or do you have to subscribe?
Animedubs,37j3ii,JRPictures,1 point,Thu May 28 11:26:44 2015 UTC,"The simulcasts are free, but you'd have to wait a week to watch the latest episode for free. If you subscribe you get the latest episode as soon as it airs and as well the dub."
Animedubs,37j3ii,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Thu May 28 14:07:51 2015 UTC,So no news on the cast?
Animedubs,37j3ii,superange128,1 point,Thu May 28 11:48:43 2015 UTC,"If they are joking like this, I think they are (hopefully) raising suspense that they got at least most of the original cast back"
Animedubs,37j3ii,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Thu May 28 15:23:21 2015 UTC,"Kyon, Nagato and Haruhi are a must have. The rest are good... but not as memorable. Hope they got all of them back."
Animedubs,37j3ii,superange128,1 point,Thu May 28 15:57:50 2015 UTC,Aw I love Stephanie Sheh and Bosch as Mikuru and Koizumi
Animedubs,37j3ii,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Thu May 28 17:38:57 2015 UTC,Don't get me wrong. I loved them too.
Animedubs,37j3ii,Blackpiece,1 point,Thu May 28 17:45:41 2015 UTC,Shark McShark must be very talented to be able to play all the character....why havent i heard of him before... even google doesnt know him.... must be a new guy with way... way... way too much talent... LOL
Animedubs,37j3ii,Blackpiece,2,Thu May 28 16:00:02 2015 UTC,is it only me or did the website just change the Shark McShark name? i click the link a second time and the cast is different... which is much better.... :)
Animedubs,37jd4s,NeonFangX,6,Thu May 28 01:28:00 2015 UTC,176-187 is released on 6/30/15 dub.  :)
Animedubs,37jd4s,brain1234333,1 point,Thu May 28 05:53:40 2015 UTC,Yes! New episodes this month!
Animedubs,37jd4s,kyleey,2,Tue Jun 2 02:31:21 2015 UTC,Just a question: Are they planning to just continue and dub Fairy Tail (2014) soon?
Animedubs,37jd4s,TwistedBOLT,2,Thu May 28 11:40:24 2015 UTC,"Isn't episode 176 the start of fairy tail 2014, it says so on Wikipedia at least.  I think they will just release the dubbed episodes in chunks alongside the DVD/BluRay as they have been doing."
Animedubs,37jd4s,biome3,2,Thu May 28 12:46:23 2015 UTC,Oh? I did not know that but that's great news! So they'll just keep on dubbing episodes without stopping?
Animedubs,37jd4s,TwistedBOLT,3,Thu May 28 13:19:54 2015 UTC,"The show is popular enough, and there are no signs of it stopping, I think its safe to assume that there going to dub every single episode that comes out until the show finishes."
Animedubs,37dxqd,lemifoo,1 point,Tue May 26 22:41:21 2015 UTC,"What an great headline: ""revenge takes its final form"". I love how these latest movies have a bit of humor to them."
Animedubs,37dw8b,Clannad-Feelchair,3,Tue May 26 22:30:56 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like it will, at least not yet. If I were you, I wouldn't count on it. The same goes for Nanatsu too, unfortunately...  I'd love to hear Meliodas and Ban in English :D  PS. Hope they forgot about Hestia too ;))"
Animedubs,37dw8b,MrReynevan2,2,Tue May 26 22:35:04 2015 UTC,"so what would indicate an anime getting a dub?  What's the process? I  feel like with an anime with such great ratings, it would be a no brainer  to  dub it."
Animedubs,37dw8b,MrReynevan2,3,Tue May 26 22:39:25 2015 UTC,"It would... but its not that easy.  First of all, it depends on the company that licenses the anime in US. If they decde that it's worth to dub the anime, they can do it either on their own, or ask some studio to do it on their license, in short.  So basically, if it was licensed by FUNImation, the dub would be already finished. Not to mention, the quality would be awesome, but also, voice roles would be probably assigned to well-known actors."
Animedubs,37dw8b,rjc523,2,Tue May 26 22:43:21 2015 UTC,funi is like an 99% chance to get a dub lol.
Animedubs,37dw8b,MrReynevan2,1 point,Wed May 27 07:33:58 2015 UTC,True ;d

Animedubs,37dw8b,rjc523,1 point,Fri May 29 10:28:10 2015 UTC,maybe lol.
Animedubs,37dw8b,Pikagreg,1 point,Wed May 27 07:34:18 2015 UTC,"Aniplex seems to avoid dubs for shows that they don't think will sell as well. So far they did dubs for Blue Exorcist, SAO, Fate/Zero, Madoka, and Magi.   They did not dub Oreimo, Silver Spoon, Monogatari, Nisekoi, Valvrave, or Zvezda.   Personally I wouldn't count on a dub based on their recent releases, though we can hope."
Animedubs,37dw8b,shwag945,3,Wed May 27 22:18:28 2015 UTC,"Monogatari is undubbable because of the nature of the show. puns, references, ect."
Animedubs,37dw8b,Pikagreg,1 point,Wed May 27 23:19:51 2015 UTC,Yeah that one makes sense at least :p
Animedubs,37dw8b,rjc523,1 point,Wed May 27 23:28:49 2015 UTC,doesn't funi have rights to nanastsu?

Animedubs,37dw8b,rjc523,1 point,Wed May 27 07:53:23 2015 UTC,i thought i saw someone said they did and idk why. maybe they have their hands full with broadcast dubs and normal dubs lol.
Animedubs,37dw8b,ScarRed_Tiger,1 point,Wed May 27 22:17:24 2015 UTC,"Your Lie in April is an Aniplex property. They tend to dub their highly demanded shows so they can get the most out of their Limited Editions. Couldnt predict when a release will be announced, but I am expecting an english track"
Animedubs,37dw8b,rjc523,1 point,Tue May 26 22:50:07 2015 UTC,really?
Animedubs,37dw8b,superange128,1 point,Wed May 27 07:34:05 2015 UTC,I feel like Your Lie in April can go either way. It's a very well-regarded show online but it doesn't seem like a casual favorite.   Of course I'd very much like for it to get a dub.
Animedubs,37dw8b,rjc523,1 point,Thu May 28 15:27:20 2015 UTC,looks and sounds cool lol
Animedubs,37abgs,razorlikeblue,4,Tue May 26 03:42:10 2015 UTC,WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOOOORRGGGGHGHGHGGHGHGAAAASFHAD
Animedubs,376dns,razorlikeblue,15,Mon May 25 06:39:40 2015 UTC,The Devil Is A Part Timer has one of the funniest and best sounding dubs I've heard in a long time
Animedubs,376dns,Baykey123,6,Mon May 25 12:18:24 2015 UTC,"Baccano's definitely a stellar one for sure.  Otherwise I'd say their dub for Steins;Gate is absolutely fantastic, not a single weak link in that one."
Animedubs,376dns,JRPictures,4,Mon May 25 07:08:23 2015 UTC,I found the steins gate dub good mainly for j michael tatum as okabe . He really carried that dub in my opinion . The weakest link for me was who they casted for moeka and mayuri . They sounded green compared to the rest of the dub cast .
Animedubs,376dns,Bashnek,3,Mon May 25 07:39:01 2015 UTC,Really? I though mayuri's english actress was the best of the lot
Animedubs,376dns,superange128,1 point,Mon May 25 15:55:38 2015 UTC,I actually think Mayuri's English VA is better than Japanese since she just sounds just ditzy and not mentally dumb
Animedubs,376dns,notorious2122,7,Thu May 28 15:38:16 2015 UTC,"Yea baccano is the first one I think of, definitely top notch. Fullmetal Alchemist is kind of an obvious one, but great none the less.   I really liked the Haganai dub. I believe it was Whitney Rodgers first role as Yozora on there, and she might have peaked early with that. Alexis Tipton best role was Rika, and Jad Saxton was great as Sena. The rest of the cast was stellar as well, no real weak points. Though I've heard some people hate on this dub, I really can't see why.   I'm not sure if it was dubbed by funi, but Spice and Wolf is great as well. Though it was more like a one trick pony, with Brina Palencia as Holo. I think that was hands down her best role, that I've seen."
Animedubs,376dns,SolDarkHunter,3,Mon May 25 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah spice and wolf is a funimation dub , in the case  of haganai like any dub some people won't like it for one reason or another ."
Animedubs,376dns,SolDarkHunter,10,Mon May 25 18:02:27 2015 UTC,Hellsing Ultimate  I've heard nothing that can top Crispin Freeman's Alucard. Nothing.
Animedubs,376dns,The-Sublimer-One,3,Mon May 25 06:58:41 2015 UTC,I was thinking of dubs done in house by funimation and not outsourced but yeah that counts for sheer acting .
Animedubs,376dns,TwistedBOLT,1 point,Mon May 25 07:41:28 2015 UTC,They only outsourced it because of legal issues with Freeman's unionized status (Funimation is a non-union company). I think they more or less were still in charge of the dub in all but name.
Animedubs,376dns,RedAttorneyMember010,2,Mon May 25 23:16:35 2015 UTC,His Jeremiah in Code Geass is also to die for.
Animedubs,376dns,JRPictures,1 point,Mon May 25 22:51:07 2015 UTC,"Jackson, Gildart as the Major also has to be noted. His speech sent shivers down my spine."
Animedubs,376dns,GenTheIdiot,4,Mon May 25 23:53:57 2015 UTC,"Black Lagoon (although not sure if that counts)   If not, then Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt (yes I'm a fan of dubs that swear in English haha)"
Animedubs,376dns,Ayevee,3,Mon May 25 07:00:53 2015 UTC,"Black Lagoon (although not sure if that counts)   It would only really count for Roberta's Blood Trail which they outsourced to Canada, where the first 2 seasons were dubbed. So technically it counts, but not as a dub Funimation did with their own studio."
Animedubs,376dns,LifeFailure,2,Mon May 25 07:09:50 2015 UTC,"Black Lagoon, because all of the characters are supposed to speak English anyways, so it's the most logical. And well made."
Animedubs,376dns,The-Sublimer-One,5,Mon May 25 15:26:07 2015 UTC,It's gotta be Death Parade. Lots of characters show up for 1 episode and give amazing emotional performances.  Plus there's Jad Saxton.
Animedubs,376dns,Angrymuffin16,2,Mon May 25 10:40:30 2015 UTC,There's already a dub?! Time for a rewatch.
Animedubs,376dns,Tusilos,1 point,Mon May 25 11:50:43 2015 UTC,"Haven't seen it , I do know people have mixed reactions to this show ."
Animedubs,376dns,mqtaylor2,3,Mon May 25 18:07:40 2015 UTC,"Really? For the most part, I'd say people's reactions have been overwhelmingly positive."
Animedubs,376dns,JeremyMcDev,3,Mon May 25 22:53:24 2015 UTC,I agree with Baccano! I think that's the best dub to this date.  Another one that comes to mind is Steins;Gate. J Michael Tatum did an amazing job as Okabe.
Animedubs,376dns,ScarRed_Tiger,3,Mon May 25 16:31:22 2015 UTC,Assassination Classroom had an awesome dub. One of the best dubs i know. And there is Monica Rial <3
Animedubs,376dns,superange128,3,Mon May 25 18:38:27 2015 UTC,Fullmetal Alchemist. I'd say thats one of the only anime's I 100% should be watched dub. Though I have yet to watch Baccano.
Animedubs,376dns,lowhead,2,Mon May 25 20:18:23 2015 UTC,"Baccano is set in 1930's america so the dub is very fitting , if you watch it the first thing you will notice is how much effort was put into it . Funimation  really did there homework with baccano ."
Animedubs,374x1w,Hiltonium,2,Sun May 24 22:24:18 2015 UTC,Reminds me of Amanda Lee! We can always do with more variety amongst English covers! Great work!
Animedubs,373fyx,mqtaylor2,17,Sun May 24 14:50:32 2015 UTC,"Going off of post 2010   Magi-s1 and Magi-s2 - both dubbed on netflix but the audio is messed up on episode 3? on the second season i think (it was when i watched it) Psycho-Pass amd S2 i liked the second season despite its flaws Dusk Maiden of Amnesia Kill la Kill - make sure to watch the Special which is the real finale the entire Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica franchise Toradora! - seires is old. dub is very new Eve no Jikan- exactly 2010 Durarara!! (2010) and Durarara!!x2 Shou (finishing airing on CR on tuesday) Hal Jormungand and s2 Robotics;Notes Attack on Titan Stiens;Gate Baka to Test franchise  D-Frag!-Amazing dub, somewhat girls doing cute things (parody), but with leave you in stitches. The World God Only Knows Franchise Kokoro Connect maybe missing others"
Animedubs,373fyx,shwag945,2,Sun May 24 16:52:58 2015 UTC,Time of eve is dubbed? I searched everywhere before decided to watch it subbed. Are you sure?
Animedubs,373fyx,Ayevee,2,Wed May 27 01:57:16 2015 UTC,The movie is. The ovas are not.
Animedubs,373fyx,shwag945,5,Wed May 27 02:46:46 2015 UTC,You are in luck. The quality of dubs have upped drastically the past few years. Especially from funimation. A few anime I would recommend:   Death Parade Wolf Children Log Horizon Mawaru Penguindrum - This one takes a few episodes before you start to understand what is happening.  Steins;Gate
Animedubs,373fyx,anonymepelle,3,Sun May 24 14:56:15 2015 UTC,i actually saw deathparade this week. got me back into an anime craving and own wolf children on bluray (got it free when i subbed to funi) will definitely check out the other two. is log horizon better than SAO?
Animedubs,373fyx,anonymepelle,7,Sun May 24 14:58:21 2015 UTC,"Man, Log Horizon is like SAO without all the bad. Watching it myself right now. pretty good stuff."
Animedubs,373fyx,hawkleberryfin,4,Sun May 24 14:59:16 2015 UTC,"I like some of the subject matter in SAO better like an actual romance or dealing with more serious issues like mental trauma, but episodes of Log Horizon are more consistently enjoyable for me. I don't really find they have many similarities at all though other than that they take place in MMOs.   Though FYI there is also the second season of SAO being dubbed right now, there's like ~10 episodes up."
Animedubs,373fyx,hack_jalsey,2,Sun May 24 19:45:17 2015 UTC,Do any of these have streaming sources?
Animedubs,373fyx,anonymepelle,2,Sun May 24 15:05:35 2015 UTC,"Death Parade you can watch on Funimation.com  Wolf Children is also funimation. I don't know if it's available for streaming. It might be if you are a member.  Log Horizon is Sentai. It is on Hulu, but I don't know if it is dubbed there. Might have to get it from the sentai store.   Penguindrum is also sentai and on Hulu. Don't know if it is dubbed, might have to download it from the Sentai site.  Steins;Gate is on funimation. You need a subscription to watch it."
Animedubs,373fyx,schlacter3101,3,Sun May 24 15:12:56 2015 UTC,Stein;s gate is also on UK netflix. Just get a UK DNS or VPN
Animedubs,373fyx,Pikagreg,2,Sun May 24 16:22:32 2015 UTC,wolf children is not sadly. its a relatively new movie i think so maybe that s why
Animedubs,373fyx,JustinKBrown,4,Sun May 24 15:47:52 2015 UTC,Colorful is a great movie and on Hulu if you haven't seen it already. It is set in middle school though has some themes to it that are very similar to Death Parade.
Animedubs,373fyx,TheVengefulMany,4,Sun May 24 16:22:51 2015 UTC,"It started prior to 2010, but the recent seasons of One Piece have been amazing. They really nailed the Water 7, Enies Lobby and Thriller Bark story arcs. The series is on Funimation's website. Assassination Classroom is currently ongoing and is really good. Episodes go up on Wednesday on Funimation. B Gata H Kei is absurdly funny if you're comfortable with some NSFW humor. The series is on Netflix. The most recent Dragon Ball Z movie, Battle of Gods, had a really good dub. I don't think it's being streamed anywhere though. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood is often referred to as one of the best dubs of all time. Most of the series is on Netflix, I think they're missing the last 10 episodes or so. Princess Jellyfish was really good, stand out performances by Josh Grelle and Maxey Whitehead. On Netflix. Patema Inverted came out last year, it has a pretty neat concept and Cassandra Lee Morris was great in it. The movie's on Hulu. Summer Wars had an amazing ensemble, pretty much the best Funimation has to offer. It's not streaming anywhere, but Toonami usually airs it in December.  Tiger & Bunny is about super heroes and their live outside of fighting crime, a lot of Los Angeles' best actors were in this. The series is on Hulu."
Animedubs,373fyx,razorlikeblue,3,Sun May 24 20:43:24 2015 UTC,"If you haven't seen Steins;Gate yet, the dub is incredible and the rest of the show is next to perfect, the only flaw I can think of being it starts off pretty slow. Totally worth watching though, one of my all-time favorites.  Plus I'm probably bias since Trina Nishimura is my favorite VA and she voiced Kurisu, one of the main characters. :)"
Animedubs,373fyx,Ayevee,3,Sun May 24 21:29:25 2015 UTC,Space dandy was one of more higher profile dubs of last year . Also the new uncut  VIZ dub of sailor moon is worth a watch if you've only seen the old censored DIC/cloverway dubs of sailor moon .
Animedubs,373fyx,kyleey,2,Sun May 24 18:00:43 2015 UTC,Death Parade is my new favorite dub. Lots of characters show up for 1 episode and give amazing emotional performances.  Plus there's Jad Saxton.
Animedubs,373fyx,potentialPizza,2,Sun May 24 21:19:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of FUNimation's newer releases are pretty average quality and rushed, therefore resulting in sub-par voice acting. Go for their larger titles like Attack on Titan. Tokyo Ghoul √A isn't a bad dub either, although they have yet to release the first season Engilsh Dubbed. You could also possibly try Death Parade."
Animedubs,373fyx,hydrosphere13,2,Mon May 25 04:22:52 2015 UTC,"Assassination Classroom. All of the voices are good, but the voice for pretty much the main character, Korosensei, is absolutely perfect in the dub. The sub's was good but the dub's is literally the voice for him in any language.  Besides that, the show is fantastic (though they do skip some good chapters and sometimes rush the pacing)."

Animedubs,36vpoe,pterynxli,3,Fri May 22 14:27:37 2015 UTC,"The ""dialects"" part of the title is because of the 2 separate Spanish dubs included here.    Since most of the anime dubs discussed here are in English, I figured this video would provide a good way to broaden discussion about other languages in which anime get translated."

Animedubs,36sr8m,hydrosphere13,1 point,Fri May 22 07:05:15 2015 UTC,Yeah it was. I used to watch this show religiously growing up. I cannot even begin to describe my hype levels right now after seeing that the brains behind ghost in the shell will be behind it.

Animedubs,36s9d4,anonymepelle,5,Thu May 21 18:37:32 2015 UTC,dub it NOW!!!... dub nation in da house!!!...
Animedubs,36s9d4,wardaniel9,2,Thu May 21 18:40:25 2015 UTC,I'm so glad Funi licensed this instead of Sentai. They're knocking it out of the park with their simulcast dubs.
Animedubs,36s9d4,dcresistance,2,Thu May 21 19:34:45 2015 UTC,Does Funi dub every movie they license? Or do we not know for sure if this is getting a dub?
Animedubs,36s9d4,notorious2122,3,Thu May 21 20:00:14 2015 UTC,They dub about 98% (arbitrary high number) of everything they license. If they are not going to dub something they usually anounce it beforehand.  For a Hosoda movie it's pretty much a guarantee.   The film were going to be licensed and dubbed no matter what so the only real question was which company was going to  do it.
Animedubs,36s9d4,notorious2122,2,Thu May 21 20:07:06 2015 UTC,"Yea, I guess I've never heard of a movie not getting a dub. The only one I can think of was Welcome to the Space Show that Gkids did. So I wasn't sure of Funi's track record, if they had ever not dubbed a movie."
Animedubs,36s9d4,kinght6,1 point,Fri May 22 00:19:07 2015 UTC,"Funimation only started to release sub only releases only recently. And there havn't been to many of those. That's for any anime they license, not only movies and they're only for less popular series.   Funimation did Summer Wars and Wolf Children also, so we can probably expect a similar release here as with those two movies.   But even if hat had been a distrebutor who did more sub only releases like say Sentai, it's still a Hosoda film so it not being dubbed isn't really something that would plausibly happen regardless of distributor."

Animedubs,36nzi3,JxckkoHD,2,Wed May 20 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"Sentai answered a question referring to the possibility of a dub though only talked about their favorite moment of the series. Ask.fm/sentaifilmworks  If you are looking for new romance dubs, Maid-sama and Chunibyo were both dubbed fairly recently."
Animedubs,36n2xm,TwistedBOLT,2,Wed May 20 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"Or better yet, has there been any news on a dub?"
Animedubs,36n2xm,RayChaos,2,Wed May 20 21:48:22 2015 UTC,Nothing official
