tories,3e2an0,luke-uk,3,Tue Jul 21 12:15:32 2015 UTC,"She might well attract a lot of centrist voters, but looking at the numbers going around she's in zero danger of winning - Burnham started out in the lead, and Corbyn's the one with momentum."
tories,3e2an0,ieya404,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:08:52 2015 UTC,"Win, win I guess. Good for us if she doesn't win and if by some miracle she does then it should benefit the country if she was to win in 2020."
tories,3e2an0,britishchink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:29:41 2015 UTC,"There was one poll by the Independent which put Kendall at a big jump to mid-20s. Still about five points behind Burnham but if Kendall keeps forcing her image onto everyone (all press = good press) then she could well have a good challenge.  Comparing that specific poll to the others, it was a surprising one because virtually no-one opted for the 'dont know' option. Therefore, all of the ones who don't know are inclined to go for Kendall, which is interesting I think."
tories,3e2an0,ieya404,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:30:42 2015 UTC,"There was something else posted earlier today, suggesting that Kendall will come fourth, her second preferences will go strongly to Yvette Cooper, who will then be in a tight run-off with Corbyn as Burnham's second preferences split fairly evenly.  Which would potentially give us another Labour leader elected by the narrowest of margins.  Are they trying to pick candidates to entertain us?"
tories,3e2an0,TheNecromancer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:54 2015 UTC,"Either of those options works well enough for us, I'd say.  The biggest threat is also the least likely to matter."
tories,3e2an0,BlackJackKetchum,3,Tue Jul 21 17:03:56 2015 UTC,"As some journo put it the other day, only own, dear Labour party could damn someone by linking her to its most successful leader ever.  Further, Kendall, who is a sensible enough centrist / centre left type gets damned by the 'no compromise with the electorate' wing(s) of the Labour party because she is interested in winning.  After all, the entire point of a political party is to gain power in order to enact a programme.  In our last leadership I opted for Cameron over Davis, because while I prefer DD's politics, I could not stomach another lost election and thought that trimming to the wind was the sensible move.  Back on Kendall, I would fear her premiership the least of the four candidates, but it is precisely because she would have the greatest chance of winning in 2020 that I'm rooting for Corbyn......."
tories,3e2an0,BlackJackKetchum,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:13 2015 UTC,Do you think there is a possibility that Corbyn could win back a lot of Green and SNP voters? Or is that far left generation of Labour well and truly unelectable?
tories,3e2an0,Evsie,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"I think the Labour party in Scotland is lost until it comes up with a credible Scottish leadership team.  The SNP have done to Labour what Labour did to us - painted us as 'unscottish' - and that is not easily undone.  There might be some movement of Green voters to a Corbyn-led Labour party, but they would be outnumbered by folk running from Corbyn towards us and the Lib Dems - remember them?.  He has little to say on green issues, from what I can see."
tories,3e2an0,britishchink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:44:10 2015 UTC,"For now...   There's a generational shift which will happen when the boomers start dying off (sorry if that sounds callous) and how that plays out is anyone's guess. Yes people drift right as they age, but a lot of the ""new elderly"" (for want of a better phrase) 15/20 years from now will not remember the Thatcher years fondly so that drift may not be so pronounced as it has been historically.   That said, Mr Cameron is not wildly popular, and had Labour run anyone remotely electable in May I'm not sure he'd still be PM so there could well be a backlash against the Conservatives in 2020 whoever runs, and let's not forget you'll have your own leadership contest before then assuming DC is as good as his word, and I think he probably will be."
