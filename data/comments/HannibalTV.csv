HannibalTV,3e2hpk,Gundaranger,46,Tue Jul 21 13:25:05 2015 UTC,In the books IIRC he was a nurse accused or convicted of child molestation whom Mason hires to be his personal nurse. After he gets paralyzed he uses Cordell to collect some childrens' tears for the martinis as well as organizing Hannibals demise in the pig pen.
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,ak47workaccnt,30,Tue Jul 21 14:02:28 2015 UTC,"He is almost like a parody of Hannibal to me. He may be a great chef and surgeon, but he lacks the elegant, mature and charming character that makes Hannibal so likeable or even admirable.  Cordell seems like a child in a chocolate factory on the Verger farm. He can finally do and show off what he wants to, free from any foreseeable legal consequences.  No idea about his backstory, but I guess his motives to work for Mason were money and the freedom to torture people."
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,brobrobroccoli,9,Tue Jul 21 13:52:25 2015 UTC,I didn't find him as lacking in class & I don't think it's fair to compare people to Hannibal. I think Cordell has a lot of class... and is a psychopath.
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,FuckOffMightBe2Kind,8,Tue Jul 21 15:02:44 2015 UTC,I agree. Cordell seemed very refined and spoke rather eloquently when he divulged to Hannibal the manner and preparation that it would require to cook him as if he were being served at a 3 star Michelin restaurant.
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,Kuze421,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"Did you read on the ""Feeding Hannibal"" blog, though, that the food stylist chose to have Cordell serve Oysters Rockefeller because they're quote-unquote ""classy"", but no real connoisseur would serve them? It was a way of showing Cordell's lack of real refinement.    That and the clunky pig's head centerpiece with the overcooked penis sausages--compared to some of Hannibal's creations, that might as well have been carved with a chainsaw."
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,ratbastid,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:39:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Those are good points. But I would also add that Hannibal seemed very pleased with the creativity and slow preparation of some of his limbs, as Cordell explained away to Hannibal. We can never truly tell what appeases Hannibal about his current situation but he seemed very much satisfied with what Cordell was...feeding him, so to speak. I just now realized how much I like cannibal puns."
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,Kuze421,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:48:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's fair to compare people to Hannibal   Or, you know, nice. Even Cordell."

HannibalTV,3e2hpk,meinkush,22,Tue Jul 21 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"Well, when his stint as the Priest of the Yellow King didn't quite work out...."
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,Saguine,6,Tue Jul 21 14:45:38 2015 UTC,"I thought he was an interesting change from the reluctant, victimized version of Cordell from the Ridley Scott film.  In the show they made him Mason's utterly game right-hand man, which was fun and also logical since Carlo and his brother were killed off in Season 2."
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,FatherDude,6,Tue Jul 21 14:33:27 2015 UTC,"I think for the film, they gave Cordell some of Margo's characteristics."
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,lbcsax,2,Tue Jul 21 15:54:05 2015 UTC,That's a good observation.
HannibalTV,3e2hpk,FatherDude,2,Tue Jul 21 15:59:30 2015 UTC,"The saying ""Evil brings men together"" comes to mind. Despite Cordell being an evil immoral asshole I think he is a well-rounded character. At least in the TV show - because he also seemingly has virtues like loyalty, passion and intellect."

HannibalTV,3e1i8z,ZealotKingPrime,14,Tue Jul 21 06:07:11 2015 UTC,Nope. Writers said it's Will and Margot's fetus.  It was mentioned that this part of the story was carried over from season 2 so I'm guessing Mason had it done then and let it grow and die.  I'm guessing the heart beat stopped recently since there was no decomp and Mason brought up the surrogate.
HannibalTV,3e1i8z,akuma_river,17,Tue Jul 21 11:18:02 2015 UTC,"It was hers and Will's. It's probably not, but pigs are very similar to humans, biologically, in many ways. For example, I believe that they've been used as a replacement for dialysis (in real life, not just House, MD). Plus, let's remember that the show isn't quite committed to things being super realistic."

HannibalTV,3e1i8z,Jackal_6,4,Tue Jul 21 12:32:34 2015 UTC,"I had a look online about the legitimacy of growing a foetus inside a pig and it didn't look like it could really happen despite the biological similarities between pigs and humans. I assumed that Mason paid some other woman to carry the child up to a certain point and then removed it and let it die inside the pig. Who knows though, we're probably not meant to think about it too much, haha."
HannibalTV,3e1i8z,tealkraken,5,Tue Jul 21 11:58:28 2015 UTC,That's what a normal fucking person would have done hired a woman to act as surrogate. But Mason is such a detestable human being he couldn't even extend that amount of courtesy to Margot. I guess he selected the pig to remind her exactly how he viewed her.
HannibalTV,3e1i8z,Peanutbutta33,5,Tue Jul 21 16:02:17 2015 UTC,"When Margot was given a hysterectomy, it's implied that Mason implanted Margot's embryo into a female pig. It's very possible that the embryo could have implanted into the uterine wall and developed for some amount of time, but obviously couldn't survive."
HannibalTV,3e1i8z,Wolfir,4,Tue Jul 21 17:06:37 2015 UTC,I think the baby was Margot and Will's.

HannibalTV,3e1i8z,shortbitcoin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:03:21 2015 UTC,I thought the infant lived. Wasn't that the whole point of Margot finally being able to kill Mason because a) should could get away with it with Hannibal in the house and b) because there was now a legitimate male heir to the Verger fortune.
HannibalTV,3e1i8z,redpiano82991,6,Tue Jul 21 15:21:49 2015 UTC,I thought it was dead and Margot was able to kill Mason because she had his sperm and could use it to produce an heir.
HannibalTV,3e1i8z,e-honey,4,Tue Jul 21 15:50:31 2015 UTC,"Oh, true. I guess you could say that Mason Verger planted the seeds of his own destruction."

HannibalTV,3e0xv8,ablebodiedmango,19,Tue Jul 21 02:49:53 2015 UTC,After what they did to Dexter I wouldn't trust any series with Showtime.
HannibalTV,3e0xv8,RagingDriftWood,12,Tue Jul 21 05:04:21 2015 UTC,Showtime is notorious for interfering and ruining it's popular series. As much trouble and neglect NBC has brought Hannibal I'm glad it's on here and not there. HBO is often a lot more tropey and has random sex scenes for no reason. AMC may be the best bet as they like things critically acclaimed and are hands off other than occasionally being cheap. Possibly even FX would be good. But all things considered NBC wasn't too bad.
HannibalTV,3e0xv8,SirGallantLionheart,2,Tue Jul 21 05:02:30 2015 UTC,They gave Hannibal far more than it had earned.  Only because they were incredibly patient did it make it this far.  They pushed the premiere for fuller when he was over.  I really don't get how they neglected or caused Hannibal trouble.
HannibalTV,3e0xv8,byahseeker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:24:33 2015 UTC,"I think FX would be the best channel for it to be on. They let people have a LOT of creative freedom (Louis CK has complete creative control over Louie, he is just paid less), with shows like Fargo and American Horror Story being as weird as they are.   AMC aren't beyond fucking shows up. They screwed with The Walking Dead quite a lot, randomly cutting budgets and firing showrunners."
HannibalTV,3e0xv8,SmashingTeaCups,4,Tue Jul 21 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah no.... Showtime (even though they have some fantastic shows) just tends to ruin it's shows. Dexter and Weeds are two great examples, and Shameless (another favourite show of mine) is slowly sinking down the drain as well.  Seriously... Showtime is the only network where I've started to pray for shows to be cancelled at their peaks. Before they get bad."
HannibalTV,3e0xv8,RunicLordofMelons,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:19 2015 UTC,or they ran their course.  Dexter should not have gone on for 8 seasons. neither did Weeds. Hannibal has a natural and definitive arc based on the books.  Dexter it was obvious that they ran out of ideas by season 4.
HannibalTV,3e0xv8,GaiusSherlockCaesar,3,Tue Jul 21 17:13:10 2015 UTC,Hannibal would just end up being a lumberjack as the result of the most dissapointing series finale ever.

HannibalTV,3e0xv8,akuma_river,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:44 2015 UTC,I have no idea why NBC got it. Maybe they paid more at the Upfronts or something when the pilot was being shopped around.
HannibalTV,3e0xv8,d007h8,2,Tue Jul 21 11:19:06 2015 UTC,I'm sure Bryan Fuller has said it was because Jen -something- at NBC promised to let them make the show they wanted if they allowed NBC to have it.

HannibalTV,3e0qkh,ohhimark108,7,Tue Jul 21 04:03:10 2015 UTC,"Well, HBO has been in talks for over a year now to film an American rendition of the British 'Utopia' series.  Granted, this would be a complete re-make, so your point still stands...  I'm pretty hyped about it actually, as a fan of the original, and hope they go ahead with it.  David Fincher would be behind the wheel directing, and they're considering to cast Roony Mara as Jessica Hyde."
HannibalTV,3e0qkh,frank_leno,2,Tue Jul 21 07:37:33 2015 UTC,"It has potential, but the British version would be extremely hard to top. If Fincher is directing though, I definitely like its chances."

HannibalTV,3e0qkh,Peanutbutta33,5,Tue Jul 21 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"Dude, I will give The Leftovers a degree of respect because the whole show is built around a central event that is essentially a maguffin and will never be answered or explained within the series yet is never marginalized yet takes on a life of its own as the thing that quietly gnaws at your sanity in the background while your life unfolds. It is a very meta statement about the state of our own perceived realities.  Isn't the whole point of the show to observe how people cope with being denied their final explanation and the resolution of the overarching story?     I gotta say it takes some balls to do a show that literally says fuck you to the basic narrative structure we're used to seeing in episodic television.   I don't care all that much for the show, but I love what they're trying to do.   From a storytelling point of view, I would call The Leftovers groundbreaking.   Hannibal is equally as groundbreaking as a series and for similar reasons.  But in a different way.  The internal consistency coupled with the artistic visual imagery is breathtaking.  It excels in storytelling precisely by maximizing every aspect of the manner in which the story can be told.    It both assaults and tantalizes all the senses, its every scene is a splendidly rotten gourmet.  And it produces a singularly visceral experience for those with the palate to stomach it."
HannibalTV,3e0qkh,Max_Trollbot_,0,Tue Jul 21 13:55:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, I can agree on some degree: we obviously won't get an answer as it's clearly not the purpose. And it comes from one of ""Lost"" producers.  I have nothing against the story in itself either and I can certainly understand why some people like it.  [spoiler] I just cannot stand the way it is directed: it's far from being neutral and the oppressing feeling of that central event being some sort of divine punishment -episode 9, which left me speechless, and not in a good way- is what makes me hate the show.  They also give way too much credit to the ""Guilty Remnant"". Way too much. Been such a long time I've hated a tv-show/movie that bad."
HannibalTV,3e0qkh,shiofuki,3,Tue Jul 21 15:59:27 2015 UTC,Which one is the worst? Leftovers or UK utopia? I'm a bit confused.

Bryan Fuller's contractually obligated first priority is now American Gods, Laurence Fishburnes is Blackish, etc.   Hannibal will be unable to jump right back into production for an air date of season 4 this time next year. Given the soonest Hannibal would be back is 18 months, and considering it's absolutely God awful ratings, other networks are rightfully leery if anyone will come back after a long layoff."
HannibalTV,3e0qkh,Oilfan9911,5,Tue Jul 21 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"Realistically, even if they could get the band back together in 18 months, it would be a minimum of 6-9 months of production before the fourth season could begin airing.  So we're really talking about 2+ years wait."

It may have a dedicated fanbase, but that's not anywhere as big as a lot of you would like. Shows like Game of Thrones in subreddit size alone are many times larger than this community.   The Game of Thrones subreddit, for example has 566 thousand subscribers compared to the 24 thousand on here, the show just isn't as popular in the masses for it to ever be financially viable.  Just my 2 cents."
HannibalTV,3e0qkh,frankgogol,7,Tue Jul 21 11:19:30 2015 UTC,The quality of a show is not measured by how many people watch it. That's like saying Transformers: Age of Extinction was a better film than the Godfather because more people spent money on tickets to see it in theaters.
HannibalTV,3e0qkh,chekhovscricketbat,5,Tue Jul 21 13:56:31 2015 UTC,"It doesn't answer OP's question because HBO doesn't rely on viewership numbers for profit. HBO spent years happily airing shows like Treme whose fanbase would make Hannibal's look massive. Their game is prestige. Hannibal would add to that prestige.  The real answer has already been said, it's that HBO doesn't pick up revivals from other networks. They have no need."

I had no interest in it whatsoever and I was actually sort of disappointed it was going to end on a story that is very focused on a character we haven't even seen thus far. Then I read the book last week. Can't fucking wait.
HannibalTV,3e055u,Psychopath-,8,Mon Jul 20 22:59:04 2015 UTC,You won't be disappointed. Especially if Fuller makes changes. This could be the most faithful in spirit but off the rails adaptation of the book. And there better fucking be a Dragon.
HannibalTV,3e055u,drh0usemd,4,Mon Jul 20 23:01:58 2015 UTC,"The book has some terrific imagery, too, and you know how much Bryan Fuller loves his visuals. I feel like I could draw Dolarhyde's house and the room upstairs with the Dragon just from the descriptions in the book.  Everything I've heard says that Armitage is excellent as Dolarhyde and I was behind Rutina Wesley as Reba McClane as soon as it was announced. I'm excited for Freddy to come back, and seeing as they did the wheelchair thing, I'm wondering... well, things I shouldn't say because I'm on mobile and I don't know how to do spoiler tags.  And look at Hannibal in those photos - he looks even more the smug bastard sitting there in his glass cage. I'm actually incredibly hopeful.  The last episode showed just how well Fuller could balance his aesthetics with things actually happening, and if he can maintain that balance with this seemingly more direct storyline, it's got every reason to be fantastic."
HannibalTV,3e055u,drh0usemd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:10:55 2015 UTC,"Rutina Wesley is a great actress. Unfortunately, her role as Tara Thornton on True Blood was complete shit after the fourth season.  As for Red Dragon, it's one of my favorite story lines.  I rewatched the movie last night in preparation for Saturday and I got really excited. The anticipation is killing me. Ralph Fiennes' performance as Francis Dolarhyde was phenomenal. From what I've seen in the Red Dragon story arc trailers, I have no doubt that Armitage can live up to the expectation."
HannibalTV,3e055u,your_mind_aches,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:23:54 2015 UTC,"And there better fucking be a Dragon.   Ohhhh, there definitely will (no pun intended)."
HannibalTV,3e055u,Psychopath-,3,Mon Jul 20 23:25:10 2015 UTC,I literally just watched the movie for the first time and I absolutely loved it. I dunno if it's because of low expectations fresh off of seeing Hannibal (2001) but I loved Red Dragon almost as much as Silence of the Lambs!
HannibalTV,3e055u,your_mind_aches,3,Mon Jul 20 23:34:45 2015 UTC,I just remember being really bored with Ed Norton.
HannibalTV,3e055u,Psychopath-,7,Mon Jul 20 23:39:57 2015 UTC,"Really? I loved him in it.   All in all, seeing Odin consult the Hulk on how to catch Voldemort was just fun."
HannibalTV,3e055u,your_mind_aches,3,Mon Jul 20 23:44:49 2015 UTC,"To be fair this was around the time it came out, it didn't have my full attention, and all I really remember is the scene at Graham's house near the end. I just recall not being impressed with Norton's Graham, which is surprising, because I like him in a lot of other things. I might have to revisit it now that I'm not 15-16 years old."
HannibalTV,3e055u,Psychopath-,2,Mon Jul 20 23:50:14 2015 UTC,"I was around 4 at that time, wow. Hahaha.   Yeah, you should revisit it. It's a bit refreshing to see a Will that isn't so dependant on Hannibal, which I hope we get to see in the Red Dragon arc in the show too."
HannibalTV,3e055u,d007h8,2,Mon Jul 20 23:58:01 2015 UTC,"I forget how old I am sometimes. Maybe I'll watch it tonight. Then I can watch Manhunter on Tuesday (always had a soft spot for that strange film). Wednesday's Mr. Robot, and after that it's time for Hannibal again. I could live with that arrangement.  I'm also really interested to see Will interacting with Hannibal. Red Dragon book Will is pretty different from Hannibal series Will, but I'm wondering if he'll become more similar now that this has all gone down.  Part of the draw of the series - for me - has been this version of Will. Hannibal is interesting, everyone knows that; evil usually is. But Will's earlier portrayals remind me of the main character in Grimm - total straight arrow, no risk of deviating from his impeachably moral course. Hannibal's Will is conflicted and unpredictable - and, I think, more interesting for it."
HannibalTV,3e055u,Psychopath-,3,Tue Jul 21 00:01:34 2015 UTC,"I forget how old I am sometimes   Dude, I was 21 (now 34) when Red Dragon came out so I'm a fair bit older than you. I am always surprised when I see how much younger than me other members of this subreddit are. :-/"
HannibalTV,3e055u,your_mind_aches,2,Tue Jul 21 06:39:12 2015 UTC,"I think it's great. Being able to talk with kids in high school helps me to not forget that I was a teenager just like that not so long ago, and one thing I wanted badly was just to be taken seriously as an individual with the potential to have valid and unique things to say and the ability to add to a discussion. I almost feel sorry for people who dismiss a message based on their often false preconceptions of the messenger - they end up missing out by being so convinced that there's nothing of value to be seen unless they themselves decide to recognize it as such. Not every teenager has something worthwhile to say, but not everyone my age ever developed that ability either. It's a really good way of staying grounded in the reality of how much I understood at that age and how little I was given credit for understanding. I hope I can retain this outlook long enough for my kid to make it from toddler to adolescent. In the meantime, it's kept me engaged in conversations other people might look at derisively just on the basis of the assumption that being older automatically gives you insight or validates your opinion. I think it's a healthy outlook to have.  Annnd... sorry. /rant"
HannibalTV,3e055u,drh0usemd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:18:40 2015 UTC,I hope Will will become more stable
HannibalTV,3e055u,drh0usemd,2,Tue Jul 21 01:05:53 2015 UTC,Same here. It felt like he was forced to play the character.
HannibalTV,3e055u,d_snizzy,9,Tue Jul 21 00:03:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much clearer I can get with this photo, but it's Will Graham screwing in a door.  http://i.imgur.com/5f7Vn7u.jpg"
HannibalTV,3e20lx,zombozo,7,Tue Jul 21 10:09:02 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing, all of the books have had plot points and dialogue interspersed throughout the series thus far in no chronological order.   Major plot points of Hannibal and Hannibal Rising took place in the Italy arc of season 3 and the vast majority of Red Dragon will happen in the rest of season 3.  While we who have seen the movies and read the books know what major plot points are going to happen we have no idea what Bryan is going to do with it.  We already know that the relationship between Will, Francis, and Hannibal will be different. We know the season will end differently than the books or movies did.   So I don't really think you will be spoiling yourself. In fact, I think you will be forewarned that crazy shit is about to happen and can prepare yourself for what is to come.  Mainly, this is like GoT and The Red Wedding. We had that in season 2 with the The Red Dinner aka Mizumono except we had no idea it was coming. The Red Dragon is coming and I think you should read the book and watch the movies. Because #SomebodySaveWillGraham will be trending again.  In order:   Red Dragon (book) Manhunter (movie), best Will Graham movie wise Red Dragon (movie), Hopkins and Finnes Silence of the Lambs (book) Silence of the Lambs (movie) Hannibal (book) Fair warning, it's pretty fucked up. Not even Bryan went there with what they did to Clarice. Hannibal (movie) Hopkins and not as fucked up. But the brain thing happens. Which is why people freaked out about the saw. Hannibal Rising (book) ...most people don't count this but it has interesting bits? Hannibal Rising (movie) I'm told the movie is better than the book. Hannibal seasons 1-3 - the best of everything"
HannibalTV,3e20lx,akuma_river,2,Tue Jul 21 11:30:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you very much, this is exactly what I was looking for, a detailed guide to everything and an explanation to where Bryan's Hannibal fits. I'll start today with Red Dragon (the book) and follow your guide. Thanks again"
HannibalTV,3e20lx,akuma_river,4,Tue Jul 21 12:21:43 2015 UTC,"Np.  Fans should help fans when possible.   I just recently read the Red Dragon and it's a pretty fast and interesting read. You should be able to finish it within a few days if not today if you have time.  Btw, most people don't like Manhunter since it's 80s cheesy and it is, but I like how William Petersen portrays Will Graham. I think he does a better job of it than Edward Norton does in Red Dragon. But there is also things to love in Red Dragon like how they show the real tragedy of Francis. Not to mention Hopkins playing Hannibal.  Which is why I think Bryan who has the best of both worlds is going to knock this out of the park."
HannibalTV,3e20lx,yhiv,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:02 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, the novel Red Dragon is going to be the next 6 episodes of the show. So reading even the first chapter of it will spoil you on next week's episode."
HannibalTV,3e20lx,EveryGoodNameIsGone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:06 2015 UTC,I wouldn't read Red Dragon now (or watch Manhunter or Red Dragon) unless you're okay with completely spoiling the rest of Season 3 for yourself. Just saying. The last 6 episodes this season will be a direct adaptation of the book.
HannibalTV,3e20lx,e-honey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:27 2015 UTC,"What happens in Hannibal (the book) that is so messed up?  I saw the movie, but never read the book."
HannibalTV,3e20lx,yhiv,3,Tue Jul 21 16:38:39 2015 UTC,"There are a few differences between the book and movie.   Margot Verger exists in the book, but not the movie. She is gigantic and muscular, with a deformed clitoris, and in the end, she anally molests Mason to steal his sperm for her girlfriend. Margot is said to be lesbian only because Mason raped her. (Thomas Harris is weirdly homophobic and it crops up in strange ways.) Mason's sadism is explored: in one scene, he calls in a child and forces him to kill his pet cat, before telling him that his foster family doesn't actually like him.  Mason has literally no face. It's just exposed muscle and sinew and he has to be kept in sterile dressings and disinfected rooms to protect it. Hannibal doesn't just tell Mason to cut his face. Mason invites him over for a gay mutual-masturbation and choking session. Hannibal offers him poppers to loosen his ass for sex, but the poppers are actually hallucinogens, and he makes Mason cut his face apart while masturbating, then breaks his neck with the rope he uses to choke himself. Clarice actually enjoys eating Paul's brain, and taunts him about it. They continue eating him until he's a gibbering mess. Jack Crawford dies.   But the real weird/messed up thing people usually talk about is the ending.  In the movie, Clarice handcuffs herself to Hannibal after calling the police. Hannibal cuts off his own  hand to spare her, and flees the country.  In the novel, he drugs the shit out of Clarice and brainwashes her (like he did to Miriam Lass in the TV show). He presents her with the exhumed skeleton of her father and forces her to talk to it. They have bizarre sex, where she breastfeeds him wine, and they flee the country in love. Years later, Barney (the black guard who Hannibal was fond of) spots them kissing at a theater together."
HannibalTV,3e20lx,pancakebrain,2,Tue Jul 21 18:20:10 2015 UTC,How does Jack die? ;_;  Edit: also--   she breastfeeds him wine   What
HannibalTV,3e20lx,e-honey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:48 2015 UTC,"oh wow....yeah, that is all A LOT different from the movie (what I remember, it's been a few years)."
HannibalTV,3e20lx,akosielay,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"the ending is controversial. read it and decide for your own if it is indeed messed up. it worked out for me but for some people, it didn't. you either love it or hate it, i guess."
HannibalTV,3e20lx,konaharuhi,4,Tue Jul 21 17:48:37 2015 UTC,i glad i never watch any of the movie or read the books. the series experience was amazing
HannibalTV,3e20lx,d007h8,2,Tue Jul 21 12:08:35 2015 UTC,"I'm actually inspired to read the books now having seen the series. I know that Fuller refers to his team and himself as DJ mashup artists, or whatever, so I'm not expecting them to follow a similar narrative to the show, but it will be very interesting to see where various themes and plot points come from."
HannibalTV,3e20lx,EveryGoodNameIsGone,3,Tue Jul 21 15:01:21 2015 UTC,"Well, the rest of Season 3 is based on the first book (Red Dragon), so don't read that or watch Manhunter or Red Dragon until after the season is over if you want no spoilers.  The second book (The Silence of the Lambs) doesn't have Will in it, but it spoils where the end of the first book leaves him. The movie doesn't. So you're safe to watch the movie, especially since the show's production company doesn't have the rights to the book, so they can't use Clarice or Buffalo Bill or the general storyline from the book at all. So no spoilers there.  The third book (Hannibal) was adapted (very loosely) in the first half of Season 3. The book itself and the movie again do not feature Will at all. I can't remember if the book references him or the events of Red Dragon at all, but the movie doesn't. So you're definitely safe to watch the movie, and might be safe to read the book. Don't watch the movie until after you've watched Lambs, and likewise don't read the book until after you've read Lambs (or at least seen it).  The fourth book (Hannibal Rising) is terrible and so is the movie. Don't read/watch it. But it's a prequel to the entire series. They talked about the events of this book in the first half of Season 3 (with Chiyoh and every mention of Mischa, Hannibal's sister), so you should be safe to read/watch if you really want to. I don't think there are any references to Will or Red Dragon at all, but I could be wrong.  Personally, if I were you, I'd wait until after Season 3 is over, then:   Read Red Dragon Watch Manhunter Read The Silence of the Lambs Watch The Silence of the Lambs Read Hannibal Watch Hannibal (movie, not show) Watch Red Dragon (since it came out after Hannibal) Ignore Hannibal Rising in all forms Rewatch all 3 seasons or Hannibal and enjoy all the references you didn't catch the first time around!"
HannibalTV,3e20lx,CaptNemo131,2,Tue Jul 21 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about spoiling the TV show with the books, but the order I've heard for the books should be Red Dragon -> Silence -> Hannibal"
HannibalTV,3e20lx,skylights,2,Tue Jul 21 10:55:58 2015 UTC,"I'd advise not to read Red Dragon before watching the rest of season three, since the remainder of the season will be an adaptation of that book. Sure some things will be changed, but you will surely spoil major elements."
HannibalTV,3e0li8,agentbueller,11,Tue Jul 21 01:07:54 2015 UTC,book spoiler
HannibalTV,3e0li8,OakRiver,2,Tue Jul 21 01:16:34 2015 UTC,"That was my best guess as well, looks like he might has some sort of crazy set up where he projects the films from some sort of mask?  Edit: Also is that Lecter's office?"
HannibalTV,3e0li8,EGL23,10,Tue Jul 21 01:27:53 2015 UTC,"[BOOK SPOILER]  In the novel Red Dragon it's explained that sometimes Dolarhyde would feel like The Red Dragon was escaping from his head, like beams of light shooting out of his ears, eyes, and mouth."
HannibalTV,3e0li8,EAMike212,4,Tue Jul 21 03:46:35 2015 UTC,Maybe it's Dolarhyde imagining himself becoming the Red Dragon
HannibalTV,3e0li8,bhammer100,3,Tue Jul 21 01:19:14 2015 UTC,WTF?!
HannibalTV,3e0li8,Chocow8s,3,Tue Jul 21 01:27:16 2015 UTC,"Might be part of a dream sequence/hallucination, where he's found Hannibal's office and is trying to piece together all the stuff he did there, I'm guessing. There's this shot that got me curious as well:  http://i.imgur.com/ekrDzGQ.png  Looks cool, but it'll be really weird if those film strips are actually part of something functional."
HannibalTV,3e0li8,josh5180,5,Tue Jul 21 02:41:50 2015 UTC,"That's gotta be Dolarhyde, you can tell by the cleft lip."

HannibalTV,3e0pdh,jasonmm1979,9,Tue Jul 21 01:40:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind it if they spread out the court trial into flashbacks throughout the six episodes, but I really want them to focus on the Red Dragon more."
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,drh0usemd,3,Tue Jul 21 04:22:11 2015 UTC,"Ditto.   I want flashbacks or people commenting about things.   Hannibal surrendered here and I'm curious how he got himself declared insane. And if there was even a trial to begin with. He might have just plead guilty on account of insanity and spending his time in a mental institution instead of prison...it can happen.  Mainly, I want to get into Red Dragon and how Bryan is going to pull this off. The book isn't really that long and a 2 and a half hour movie could tell the story accurately.  Which means for this to stretch out over the next 6 eps Bryan has been playing around with things and adding more story."
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,akuma_river,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:39:34 2015 UTC,"I think they are definitely going to address how he was declared insane. But I think the fact that he's a psychopath is enough evidence for the court to declare his insanity. But then again, your idea where Hannibal just pleads guilty by reason of insanity also makes sense. Lol.  The Red Dragon story arc is one of my all time favorite. Brett Ratner fucked up Red Dragon, and I doubt Bryan Fuller would screw it up."
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,drh0usemd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:00:26 2015 UTC,What did Brent do wrong? I liked the movie. Granted I never read the book either
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,drh0usemd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:27:46 2015 UTC,Ridley Scott should've directed. Ratner is more of a comedy kind of guy.
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,akuma_river,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:44:52 2015 UTC,"Except Hannibal isn't a sociopath and while he has a psychopath personality trait so does Will, Alana, Jack, and millions of others.  Hannibal has the capacity for love and people he's fond of. He just likes to kill and eat people too. His manner of rationalizing that is what makes him insane.  Well, if you think about it. No one wants to put Hannibal on trial if they can get a plea deal out of him it's better for everyone.   I like Manhunter for William Petersen's portrayal of Will Graham. I also like Red Dragon for Hopkins and Finnes and how they show Francis as a tragic character.  Bryan is going to give us the best of everything. We already have our Will, our Hannibal, and now we have our Francis."
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,drh0usemd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:28:21 2015 UTC,"Ralph Fiennes did a fantastic job as Francis Dolarhyde. That guy played fucking Amon Goeth in Schindler's List and Voldemort in the Harry Potter franchise! Then again, those three of Fiennes' characters are psychopaths."
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,akuma_river,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:37 2015 UTC,Yep.  He really made you hurt for Francis. The poor guy. He was okay until something set him off and he took the first family.   I keep wondering what would have happened if he and Reba had fallen in love two months earlier.
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,drh0usemd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:52:43 2015 UTC,If only he wasn't so obsessed with the Great Red Dragon then he and Reba and drive off in the sunset.   OMG I WANTED THAT TO HAPPEN SO BADLY! ...BUT NOOOOO!!! :(  I literally shed tears for Francis Dolarhyde when I watched Red Dragon.
HannibalTV,3e0pdh,Saguine,3,Tue Jul 21 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"It would be cool, but we've already had ""Hannibal""s court plot arc: Will Graham in Season 2. I'd be surprised if we see more than TattleCrime snippets."

HannibalTV,3dzatt,deaddogseye81,8,Mon Jul 20 19:16:22 2015 UTC,"Not sure how Jack appears to be large and in charge again at the end, but I took the scene between him and Chilton back in Episode 4 to imply that he was leaving the FBI. (He says all the money is going into anti-terrorism these days instead of serial killers, but I didn't take that to mean that he would actually be working on terrorism cases from then on).  My only guess is that, rather than heading to Muskrat Farms to try and rescue everyone after leaving Italy, Jack went to his contacts at the FBI and got them to back him up. After finding a charnel house at Mason's farm, they proceeded to go to Will's place, which is where they find Will and Hannibal."
HannibalTV,3dzatt,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,3,Mon Jul 20 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"I think you may have misunderstood Jack. Chilton directly says Jack was forced to retire from the FBI - remember Mizumono when Kade Purnell had warrants for Jack's arrest? Jack's failure to capture Hannibal and his illegal methods to incriminate him are what made Jack lose his job. Jack said the Behavioral Science department just didn't have the resources just as a way to keep his dignity.   In short, he was basically fired which is why Pazzi said he was a disgraced. If he and Jack together could capture Hannibal they'd recover their reputation.  How Jack led the FBI to arrest Hannibal in Digestivo we don't know. There were some plot holes in that episode actually. I suppose once Chiyoh freed Jack, he called the FBI and explained the situation and led the team to Will's house based on his past experience? Because Jack was there to capture Hannibal, he gets his job back as we can see in the preview for next week's episode."

HannibalTV,3dz3of,hitalec,2,Mon Jul 20 20:28:28 2015 UTC,"Both times, I tried to acquire them when they went on sell. However, if you, or anyone has ever tried to make a purchase from Mondo, then it doesn't require saying: it's impossible.  Their posters sell out within the first minute they go on sell. I am not exaggerating. Luckily, I got their The Master poster when it went on sale during the Academy Awards a couple of years ago. But Christ. It's not fair. And some of the people who purchase them are scalpers. Very rude."

Still, the price is right so I wouldn't hold it against anybody yearning for a copy--it is so dang pretty.  I lucked out and timed things just right on Mondo, had my credit card info ready to copy-paste out of Notepad and everything.  I spent a lot of time refreshing the page over and over, gave up, then hit it one last time an hour later on a whim...and it worked.  It is huge and gorgeous and smells like paint.

HannibalTV,3dz3of,akuma_river,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:10:15 2015 UTC,"If you can't wait: https://thepiratebay.gd/search/charlie%20countryman/0/99/0 & http://kat.cr/usearch/charlie%20countryman/ & https://www.solarmovie.is/watch-charlie-countryman-2013.html (streaming)  I could tell from IMDB that it was going to tear me up. So I've been putting it off. I'll check out En Kort En Lang aka Shake It. I can't find it on Netflix but I'll add it to my list.   Btw, have you seen King Arthur (2004)? It has both Mads and Hugh in it. It's where they met and began their friendship. I only saw the dvd version on Netflix I'm torrenting the unrated version. I hear it's way better. If money wasn't tight I would have bought it from Amazon but I'm also pissed at them so... lol.  Got any other recs?"
HannibalTV,3dz3of,lightabigfire,2,Tue Jul 21 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"Sweet, thanks!   I didn't particularly enjoy King Arthur - it was pretty much the same as The Three Musketeers in that the only thing keeping me from falling asleep while watching it was pretty much Mads and not much else. It had some good scenes with Mads and Hugh (the ""getting a taste for killing"" scene comes to mind), so I'll give it that.  You've probably watched A Royal Affair (if you haven't, get on that!). I'd also recommend The Door (another personal favorite of mine, though reviews aren't that great); Adam's Apples; After the Wedding; Flame & Citron; Open Hearts (very artsy); Prague; The Green Butchers (notable since he plays a cannibal); and Flickering Lights. Those are his major roles - if you look through his filmography there's also some great films where he had smaller roles (Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself was really good). You should also check out Rejseholdet, which was a pretty good crime drama from 2000 (though IMO The Killing is still the best Danish TV show...)."

Except, if I remember correctly, in the book, Margo fishes the eel out of the water and kinda throws it on top of Mason while he's in bed. Either way, it ends up lodged in his throat."
HannibalTV,3dz2bg,bpainsickbrain,5,Mon Jul 20 19:17:22 2015 UTC,I think it's more forced down his throat by Margot in the book. She much more angry and on a steroid regime.
HannibalTV,3dz2bg,weaselbeef,3,Mon Jul 20 20:44:15 2015 UTC,"Well I am glad they went with the book ending then. I have seen the movie version of Hannibal where Mason is massacred by his own pigs if I remember correctly, and that ending didn't really seem fitting in my opinion."

HannibalTV,3dz2bg,EveryGoodNameIsGone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:29 2015 UTC,They've already broken significantly from the books by giving Will and Hannibal a much more extensive and intertwined past than they had in Red Dragon.
HannibalTV,3dz2bg,your_mind_aches,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:00 2015 UTC,"Technically the films broke that too, as well as the ones above. Red Dragon has Will and Hannibal talk about the years they spent as friends."
HannibalTV,3dz2bg,EveryGoodNameIsGone,2,Tue Jul 21 03:02:55 2015 UTC,"Manhunter didn't, and I seem to remember Red Dragon implying that he'd consulted Hannibal a couple times on a case or two before realizing it was actually Hannibal himself he was chasing.

Mason's always been obsessed with genitalia and sexual violence, namely with his dealings with Margot's impregnation. I see this as representative of his crude and animalistic nature of evil, countering Hannibal's intellectual and precise style. Hence Hannibal looking to eat Will's brain, and Mason looking to eat Hannibal's dick. So, to bring his story full circle, Mason is killed violently in a fashion which looks disturbingly like some representation of murder via deep throat gone horribly awry."

HannibalTV,3dxi0o,JeamBim,9,Mon Jul 20 23:29:48 2015 UTC,"Earlier this season, Hannibal pretended to be a famous professor at a prestigious college without disguising his appearance (one which should be world-known as a serial killer) at all. Will sailed across the Atlantic then walked the train tracks to Italy. Mason's in charge of a behemoth meat conglomerate yet it isn't newsworthy that he ate his own face off or is training his pigs to eat people. This show is choc full o' unrealistic bologna, this isn't the first thing. I'd just say, view it like a fantasy show more than a real crime drama."

HannibalTV,3dxi0o,Haberdashery2000,4,Tue Jul 21 15:01:24 2015 UTC,"Fuller's emphasized in multiple interviews how the show is only very selectively rooted in reality, with grounding characters like Jack, but its primary mode of existence is more of a metaphorical miasma. Chiyoh as a character seems to exist almost entirely in this mode, which also lets an 80-year-old man construct an enormous totem pole out of dead bodies and lets a man with advanced encephalitis survive (and even operate a vehicle) without any treatment for several months. He importance as a character, during the climax, is to help Hannibal escape, yes, but that still carries important weight: she is the surrogate child who protects her manipulator, and stands in contrast with Will.  Of course I can very easily see how this would be annoying to other viewers, especially when you get down to details. But characters like her, and the show itself most of the time, aren't designed to be nitpicked for reality checks. They're like broad-stroked figures on an impressionist painting. If you get in close to the canvas, you can complain that all you see are a bunch of meaningless colors, but the devil ISN'T in the details. It's designed to be consumed from further away, by taking a step back."
HannibalTV,3dxi0o,d007h8,2,Tue Jul 21 14:42:31 2015 UTC,"A little of what Brian Fuller had to say:  Is this the last we'll see of Chiyoh this season?  Fuller: Yes. She told Hannibal that she was going to be his keeper. She was always going to be that angel in the bushes with the rifle making sure that no one further was killed by him. That's the penance she's willing to pay for 20 years of keeping a prisoner out of the interest of not taking a life. In essence, she's saying to Hannibal, ""I'm not going to cage you, but I'm going to serve as your jailer."" But as she's watching the takedown of Hannibal, she realizes her job is done and she's free, for the first time in her life, to go off and pursue her own life.  http://www.tvguide.com/news/hannibal-postmortem-digestivo-bryan-fuller-season-3/"

HannibalTV,3dw1yy,Somnambulist815,7,Mon Jul 20 02:43:59 2015 UTC,"Aquarius had the entire season up on NBC.com, Hulu, etc for free the next day after the premiere. Lots of people (including me) binged it that week.  The hits they got from the binge is why it got renewed even though the ratings on tv are bad. Which is why I think they will keep the season 2 renewal and do the same thing next season in getting the whole season out for people to binge on and then showing Aquarius during a slow time on tv.   As for the comment about Hannibal doing better than Aquarius in the time slot that is because since Hannibal started Aquarius was beating it (slightly) in the ratings. But that might be due to it being on before Hannibal and people just not switching over to something else yet.   Either way, Aquarius' ratings went down with the move while Hannibal's stayed steady. Which means that Hannibal fans stayed with the move."

In this scene they speak again about time reversing and shattered tea cups coming together again. The electroweak force famously breaks time-reversal symmetry explicitly.

HannibalTV,3dwo88,NotActuallyCezanne,7,Tue Jul 21 16:27:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it ever comes right out and says exactly why Chiyoh is heading towards Hannibal, but here are a few notable thought thingies:   Chiyoh was tied down to her ""home"" because Hannibal left it up to her to decide whether or not to kill the man who apparently killed and ate Mischa (in Hannibal Rising, a handful of men ate her together so they could survive harsh conditions during a war). Will kinda-sorta prompted her to kill the caged man, so she no longer felt the need to stay home. Chiyoh helped Lady Murisaki (Hannibal's aunt) raise Hannibal, so she probably felt partly responsible for him, maybe?  She probably didn't want Will to kill him. As she told Bedelia, she wanted Hannibal caged, not killed. So following Will was an act to protect Hannibal from him. She apparently changed her mind, maybe after seeing Hannibal's sorta-kinda-good side when he rescued Will even after Will was going to kill him? So in the end, it might have been just a matter of being with someone she considered family. No need to ""cage the beast,"" because she saw that the beast could do good things too...?   But I could be wrong about all of that. Point being, her motives likely changed as events unfolded that showed Hannibal's good side."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,bpainsickbrain,8,Mon Jul 20 06:30:47 2015 UTC,"I dont know about her helping raise Hannibal, she looks atleast 20 years younger than him. How old do you think Chiyoh is in the show?"
HannibalTV,3dwo88,KalaniKawehiKapono,3,Mon Jul 20 09:05:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure how old she's supposed to be. She was Lady Murisaki's assistant or maid or something, I don't remember at the moment. So she is more like a younger sister to Hannibal than a mother figure."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,bpainsickbrain,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:29:43 2015 UTC,"She is meant to be Lady Murasaki's handmaid and in the book Hannibal Rising, she was around Hannibal's age when they knew each other while they were young.  http://hannibal.wikia.com/wiki/Chiyoh"
HannibalTV,3dwo88,c_megalodon,5,Mon Jul 20 09:34:26 2015 UTC,"She apparently changed her mind   I think she witnessed Hannibal turning himself in. she got what she wanted - Hannibal in a cage. For closure of her story, they might have her visit him somewhere down the line of the remaining episodes."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,betnhe,2,Mon Jul 20 09:37:36 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that in the series, it seems to be implied that there was only one man who murdered Mischa as opposed to multiple men."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,c_megalodon,2,Mon Jul 20 09:35:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm hoping we get more backstory during the second half of the season. I'm a little bummed by how little we've been told about Mischa. I've read/watched Hannibal Rising, so I know that version of the story, anyway."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,bpainsickbrain,9,Mon Jul 20 09:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'd actually prefer the rest of the season to be spent on all the Dolarhyde/Red Dragon stuffs!  I think Mischa being this mysterious, traumatic past that is never fully revealed adds more charm to the show. In Hannibal Rising (the film), Hannibal becomes too ""normal""/relatable for my taste, it sort of took away the mystery.  Though if they do give more insight on Mischa, I wouldn't complain."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,c_megalodon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:10:03 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, don't get me wrong, I am all about the Red Dragon plot. I just meant, I was waiting to hear what more Bryan Fuller did with Mischa's death and all that. I guess I expected... more... of something. We know the one guy killed her and ate her and we know Hannibal ate part of her too, but that's about it."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,bpainsickbrain,3,Mon Jul 20 10:13:53 2015 UTC,It's hinted that Hannibal found the man in the process of murdering of her (possibly rape too) and it was too late to save her.  For some reason Hannibal ate her.   And instead of killing the guy he left him to Chiyoh to punish. Maybe she was supposed to be watching after Mischa and it's her partly fault that she died?
HannibalTV,3dwo88,akuma_river,7,Mon Jul 20 11:04:35 2015 UTC,"This from the TV Guide post mortem with Bryan Fuller:  ""Is this the last we'll see of Chiyoh this season?  Fuller: Yes. She told Hannibal that she was going to be his keeper. She was always going to be that angel in the bushes with the rifle making sure that no one further was killed by him. That's the penance she's willing to pay for 20 years of keeping a prisoner out of the interest of not taking a life. In essence, she's saying to Hannibal, 'I'm not going to cage you, but I'm going to serve as your jailer.' But as she's watching the takedown of Hannibal, she realizes her job is done and she's free, for the first time in her life, to go off and pursue her own life.""  So, I can kind of get that from her scene with Hannibal, but overall, her character did not work for me.  She was used too much as a deus ex machina, and only when the writers needed her to be one.  Her attitude towards violence, torture, and killing were all over the place, so I never got a full grasp of her character."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,RabbitHoleNetwork,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:44 2015 UTC,"Shame we won't see her again. There's a lot of potential I don't believe was tapped with the character. If the show manages to get picked up, hopefully she'll be brought back in should Hannibal (inevitably) escapes later in the series."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,Mor-Tax,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:28 2015 UTC,"I agree, she was interesting at the beginning but then she sorta felt like her only purpose was to appear/be in the perfect place at the right time. When she shoots Will in the middle of the day outdoor, when she saves Jack and when she saves Hannibal when he is carrying Will."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,Rusted300,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:35:23 2015 UTC,"I thought she was trying to help arrest Hannibal?  How could she have seriously expected to follow him for the rest of his life to make sure that he was unsuccessful in killing others, especially when she was responsible for Hannibal's near-successful attempt to kill Will?  Wouldn't he have eventually tried to kill her if it went on too long?"
HannibalTV,3dwo88,STEAM_0-1-203706,9,Mon Jul 20 19:48:04 2015 UTC,the best part is she is somehow there to save jack but cant save hannibal in the same location 5 minutes earlier.  or maybe the best part was that she was in the US with her sniper rifle like a day later.  in a tree.  at the exact. fucking. right. spot.  honestly her character was shoehorning the plot along in nonsensical ways
HannibalTV,3dwo88,wookiewin,5,Mon Jul 20 04:35:18 2015 UTC,"That's because Chiyoh is not a character at all, she's a plot device."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,LouraMax,4,Mon Jul 20 19:01:10 2015 UTC,When I saw her carrying that long sniper rifle a day later in Maryland all I could think about is how did she even enter the American border with that thing?!!
HannibalTV,3dwo88,akuma_river,4,Mon Jul 20 07:54:57 2015 UTC,I don't think it was a day later. I think it was several days because they shipped Hannibal and Will as livestock.
HannibalTV,3dwo88,LouraMax,3,Mon Jul 20 11:05:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, my mistake. I just can't shake the fact she took that big sniper on a plane across the U.S. Border.  I get this is fiction. Don't mind me haha…"
HannibalTV,3dwo88,akuma_river,3,Mon Jul 20 11:33:03 2015 UTC,Did you forget this is America land of the 2nd Amendment?  She probably just bought a new one. :D

HannibalTV,3dwo88,paladin_blake,4,Tue Jul 21 16:37:57 2015 UTC,"I assumed that she saw the questora take Hannibal and assumed he'd been arrested (which is what she wanted, since she let Jack into the apartment). When the questora was going to kill Jack, she knew that he wasn't arrested and decided to rescue Jack to get the information she needed. When he was helpful, she let him go."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,Derkanus,4,Mon Jul 20 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"honestly her character was shoehorning the plot along in nonsensical ways   I agree. I think this season would've been better without Chiyoh, like if we would've teamed Will up with Pazzi or Jack or anyone else, really."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,j-dusk,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:48 2015 UTC,"Basically. I was honestly pretty intrigued by her character at first, but I've lost track of her motivation and have concerns for the integrity of her character. I thought she wanted Hannibal caged, but then she said some beasts shouldn't be caged (though someone suggested she might have meant herself?), and now she's probably going to stick around and show up at some opportune time like helping Hannibal escape maybe? I want some reassurance that she's acting for herself and not just sticking around for Hannibal, because I don't like the idea of her playing some kind of bodyguard role."

HannibalTV,3dwo88,Tipop,0,Mon Jul 20 06:41:56 2015 UTC,"My god, you people can't imagine anything you're not shown explicitly on the screen, can you? If someone suddenly shows up, it's because they were magically placed there by the writers, huh? It can't possibly be because they traveled there in their own completely logical manner.   the best part is she is somehow there to save jack but cant save hannibal in the same location 5 minutes earlier.    ... because she just got there? Why is it ok to ascribe Will's last-minute rescue from Hannibal's cranial saw as ""coincidence"" but a character can't show up a minute too late to save Hannibal.   or maybe the best part was that she was in the US with her sniper rifle like a day later.     She got there at the same speed as the kidnappers did. Why is her arrival noteworthy  if theirs is not? Also, why are you assuming she brought her rifle rather than acquiring a new one?   in a tree.  at the exact. fucking. right. spot.   Yes, so silly for a sniper to get in a good position to shoot. So unbelievable."
HannibalTV,3dwo88,Rusted300,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:15 2015 UTC,"What I didn't quite understand is how Chiyoh told Will there are other means of influence than violence...but she kills several people in the latest episode, contradicting her more pacifist stance.  Why did she shoot Will and put him in a position to be killed by Hannibal if she didn't want anyone to be harmed by him?  She wasn't the one who stopped that from happening."

HannibalTV,3dvi2j,akuma_river,4,Mon Jul 20 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"Arguably, Jack Crawford is worse than Hannibal for ruining Will's life. Jack wants to use Will, sod the consequences. Hannibal wants to help Will embrace the darkness in his mind and in a way, Will embracing the darkness allows him to embrace the good stuff."
HannibalTV,3dvi2j,sherlock2040,2,Mon Jul 20 13:19:25 2015 UTC,"True.   It's not Hannibal that ruins Will but Crawford who pushes Will towards him. Literally.  Remember season 1? Jack literally drove Will until he broke and it was Hannibal who became his confidant and the one who he leaned on.  In Season 2 Jack had regrets because he thought he drove Will to kill. But when he realized Will was innocent he drove him to betray Hannibal and set him up. No matter the consequences.  Then we have season 3.  And we all know what happened to Will in the books.  Hannibal, on the other hand got Will to delve deep into himself, accept his ability, and control it. He gave Will control, balance, and peace.   Hannibal for everything he's done directly to Will has done more good than harm. Vastly more good than Jack. That is so fucked up. And yet true."

HannibalTV,3dvi2j,lightabigfire,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:49:00 2015 UTC,Well in the book and movies he only took out two families.  They were thinking of doing hints of Francis before that..but I think that changed after the pilot and the season went on.  I just LOVE season 3. I think it's awesome.

HannibalTV,3dua2d,steviamies,7,Sun Jul 19 21:33:59 2015 UTC,"Not really...   It should just be common decency to realize that not everyone is able to watch a television show at the regular airing time. Some of us record it or torrent it and watch it later, typically the following day or weekend.   Having a productive discussion about the weeks episode is great but it shouldn't require blatant spoilers in post titles.  Personally I haven't been burnt by this too badly with Hannibal but as an avid MMA/UFC fan, being subscribed to the /r/MMA sub is a nightmare. Everyone there assumes that everyone must watch the fights live and unfortunately due to other obligations I often miss them on Saturday nights (when they typically air) and watch them on Sunday. The number of times posts have been titled with the fighters names and who was victorious are absurdly common."

I didn't pick up on the women in positions of power. All of the ladies involved in the show 'killed it' (no pun intended) in the latest episode. Chiyo and Jack were great with their ""wrong floor"" bit.  All of the restraint/prisoner gymnastics along with the funny dialogue with just the right amount of darkness and humor that, just like the article stated, kept the episode grounded and me at the edge of my seat. Good article."

HannibalTV,3e1qs3,NuclearPiano,13,Tue Jul 21 07:52:33 2015 UTC,"I think this is assigning too much blame on deviations from the source material (which I'm personally glad for, and which I think are rather blameless) rather than how much of a niche audience this series was ever going to have. In my family, two people are Harris fans, one isn't (me, oops), and all three of us weren't up to even giving this series a try when it first came out. My relatives, because they're rather fond of the Hopkins version and didn't want to see just another repeat of previous adaptations; me, because there were certain elements in SOTL and the Red Dragon novel that I disliked intensely and didn't want to see on screen. The only thing that got us to start watching was a close friend insisting that we try it. Left on our own, none of us would have touched the first episode with a ten foot pole.  Since we've been hooked, I'm finding difficulty pimping the series to others. Gore's a hard sell, and gore with a story that people already have either negative or positive impressions of, even harder."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,Chocow8s,7,Tue Jul 21 09:11:57 2015 UTC,I have always assumed that Clarice Starling's arc was merged with Will Graham's.
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,Overlord1317,2,Tue Jul 21 08:10:35 2015 UTC,"This. I appreciate this interpretation more so than line after line of why this isn't canon. With the prospect of never having access to the character of Clarice, it's likely Will was written this way to allow the character to fulfill that roll moving forward. If they do get Clarice, then meh, no sweat, Will rides off into the sunset and is written out of the show after Red Dragon.  Further, let's be honest here. Hannibal as a construct, as a monster perceived is a powerful thing. Hannibal as written by Thomas Harris... well... lets just say he took some amazing liberties with his creation to ultimately dull that sharp edge... I'm looking at you Hannibal Rising."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,mad_destroyer,14,Tue Jul 21 17:27:51 2015 UTC,"Nope. Nope nope.  No one cares about ""canon"" -- that's even more niche than the rest of it. The reason why people don't watch this show is simple: Gore + cannibalism. The general public doesn't like it."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,PigeonDrivingBus,4,Tue Jul 21 11:51:14 2015 UTC,"Eloquent as your analysis is, it's also fundamentally flawed.   In a nutshell: people would have to be watching the show in the first place in order to note these changes. And people aren't watching in the first place."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,Bardorba,3,Tue Jul 21 12:45:30 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to comment on one part of this (sry didn't have time to read the whole post yet), but I think there are actually lots of popular with the mainstream bromance heavy TV shows/books/movies out there (Sherlock Holmes being one that just immediately springs to mind but there may be other better examples). I think they generally make a big hit with just certain demographics... so there would need to be an aspect that would also appeal w/ everyone else, and I wonder if that's more so what is lacking here. I don't think ppl not into bromance would be turned off by it in this show,  I think it is just lacking something else interesting enough to pull the mainstream in. I think it's also probably harder for your average perhaps reality show viewer to grasp too... lol :) I found some episodes hard to understand completely myself. And I do agree not having Clarice and replacing her with Will definitely would hurt the show too for mainstream audiences.... since that is what most ppl know.  But yea mainly I have to point out the bromance thing seems huge in other popular media because I am into that myself, and I feel that I see lots of popular shows/movies all the time with a ton of fanfic and art created out of bromances. Though perhaps the bromance angle is more contrived from the fans in other shows, but this one is much more intentional... that could be a turn off for those not into it I guess.  But I did want to mention - my husband liked this show in s1 and started to get uninterested in s2. It wasn't due to the bromance - my husband just said it got boring and repetitive. He tried to put into words for me why he got bored - he said it started to not follow a path that made sense to him in s2. I think it got too weird for him."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,Addiekat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:41:08 2015 UTC,"I agree with you about the bromance; it's not that people dislike this element in general, and that's not what I was trying to say.  My point about NBC's Hannibal is that nobody in the mainstream expects that element to be present in this particular storyline.  If you say the name, ""Hannibal Lecter"", practically everyone immediately thinks of Clarice--who is a female character.  That is primarily owing to the films SotL and Hannibal, though readers will be familiar with the actual novels as well.  The nutshell in this is that the general audience is naturally predisposed to think about Hannibal Lecter in the context of a masculine/feminine paradigm.  So if you portray it from a bromance angle instead, then people are more likely to be left confused and disinterested in the show.  When a particular fandom comes attached with certain entrenched expectations, a writer can't just buck them to pursue their own personal vision--not unless the honest goal is for the show to eventually be cancelled.  If Bryan Fuller is happy with his three seasons of Hannibal and sincerely doesn't care, then that's fine; it's just that if he isn't, he should have known better, in my opinion."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,stampedes,2,Tue Jul 21 12:17:21 2015 UTC,"Have you been watching ANY adapted television lately? Pretty much any of them that you can list have made SIGNIFIGANT changes to plot, character relationships, etc. Even more so than Hannibal. I'll use the Walking Dead as a specific example that is doing the exact same thing that Hannibal is doing. In the original comic, two of the main characters are romantically involved and it's a large part of the story. In the TV show one of those people has already died, so instead they are giving aspects of her character to a few other people. This is the exact same situation that Hannibal is in with Clarice, except it's pretty obvious that Bryan knows he'll never get the rights to her, so he's using her as he can.  My point is, changing things between adaptions is not bucking the will of the original creator, it's offering something new for people to enjoy. It's also not a one way street to cancellation. The Thomas Harris fandom is honestly not that large, especially not the ones who are obsessed with the novels enough to care this much or otherwise decided to watch the show at all."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,Addiekat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm well. I see your point, but I don't know if I agree that the deviation from source material is that huge of a reason it is being canceled. I'm not sure if you are trying to say it's a main reason, say like 90%, or maybe just a factor in it. I could agree with it being just a factor... but I think the main reason is the way it was written in a crazy and inaccessible to a general audience way. I think it was either on here or in a YouTube video (or maybe both), that I saw some ppl mentioning how hannibal started as a very typical ""monster of the week"" criminal show and eased you into the crazy as the story progressed. I think a lot of ppl who maybe tried it for a bit just never wanted to even be eased into it :) lol, and they just stopped there. Or others never started, not because they heard it deviates from source material... but because they didn't want to see it done the same way as before.  So if they had started watching the changes may have been welcome. I could see some ppl stopping watching due to the changes but I just feel like that's a concern I've heard of a lot less often."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,imnotthere95,3,Tue Jul 21 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"The show is closer to Persona by Bergman than to the original books. I had already known the influence since there's a reference in one episode, but i have rewatched the film, and there are a lot of parallelisms, and i find it brilliant. I'm glad they didn't try to appeal the general audience. Yes, probably it would have a lot more of seasons, but the show would have lost his essence, and if we want the take of the books, we have already got both, the books and films. Trying to adapt your creativity to the public is the death of creativity. The public always applaud the same things presented in different ways, and that's sad.  Anyway, I don't consider the Hannibal of the show being OOC. He is always playing, and he didn't sacrifice himself. Will was giving up the game and he wanted to continue it because it amuses him, so he tried to make of that end a break. Plus, it's a way to keep himself in control of the situation."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,DuckingShot,3,Tue Jul 21 09:09:10 2015 UTC,"Great post.  I agree with most of what you have said.  I will tell you why this show, for real, has never been mainstream though.  It's too artsy and  - strange.  Most people want an A-Z story.  Look at Breaking Bad - the most popular show of the last decade.  It told a very simple story of a guy doing bad shit, trying to hide it, and then getting caught and having a downfall.   Great acting, interesting camera shots, but it didn't need 15 minutes of slow-motion meth making in every episode."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,Tipop,3,Tue Jul 21 14:41:13 2015 UTC,"I think you are vastly over-estimating the popularity of the source material. It may bother you and other literary purists, but for the wider television audience the books might as well not exist. Some of them have seen Silence of the Lambs — and an even smaller subset of that group may have seen the other movies based on the same sources — but very few have read the books.  Deviation from the source material is not the reason why the show didn't gain wider acceptance."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,givebacksome,2,Tue Jul 21 16:15:22 2015 UTC,"Some good points there..I agree..but even if it's not an exact reenactment, it still is a mighty good show with brilliant actors..the show doesn't deserve to die, not because it doesn't rake in moolah, but because of the power struggle within Will, the obsession of Hannibal, and the shows portrayal of the extremes of human nature..like Will not letting Hannibal go..yes, you read it right"
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,slmiami,2,Tue Jul 21 08:32:40 2015 UTC,"While I think you make some good points, I believe the general audience that watches network TV had lost interest in the Hannibal Lector subject matter long ago.  It is not as if the bromance angle was emphasized from the get go and I doubt that the early rating in season 1 were ever very good.  Regardless of how it was handled, this show was doomed on network TV before it first aired."

HannibalTV,3e1qs3,sconceknuckle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:32:54 2015 UTC,"I can agree that this show is not (and was never going to be) mainstream accessible. However a lot of your argument seems to rest on the ways the series deviates from book canon, which I can't agree with. While mainstream audiences certainly may be put off by some of the aspects you discuss (the intimacy of Hannibal and Will's relationship may be uncomfortable for some, for example) I think some of your points (Hannibal is ""out of character"") would not be of concern to most people.   When it comes down to it, most people know Hannibal Lecter primarily from ""Silence of the Lambs"" - the movie rather than the book. Harris' books are certainly popular, but I would guess the number of people who have read then is a small minority compared to the number who have seen that film (I have only read ""Red Dragon"", for example, but have seen all the film adaptations). The film version is a cultural touchstone, however Lecter has very little screen time, and most people just recall his character as a charming, cultured yet monstrous villain. The other films in the series, which explore his past and motivations, have varying degrees of popularity, but none nearly as much as ""Silence"". My point being that most people have limited exposure to Harris' canon and character development, and aren't going to be put off by things like the show changing Hannibal's back story, or having lines delivered by / to the ""wrong"" characters.  Personally I would say the gruesome aspects, dense dialogue, and the dreamlike artistic sensibility the show has embraced have a lot more to do with its niche audience than any deviations in plot, back story or character relationships from book canon."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,drh0usemd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:38:15 2015 UTC,The TV show is a re-interpretation of the novels. That explanation itself is enough as to why Fuller made specific choices as he did for the show.

Some of those who did watch were turned off by the procedural structure of the first season. And NBC's marketing was inadequate."

HannibalTV,3e1qs3,bhammer100,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:01 2015 UTC,"First of all, great job on this post. It was very clear and well thought out. It must have took you a long time to write all that. Good job. And i apologize that I won't be able to clearly express my opinions as well as you did.  On the ""bromance"" angle, i have always saw that in this series, at least when it became more pronounced as the series went along and Hannibal became more and more interested with Will. I've noticed it. But i have never really gravitated towards it. I am not one of these, i don't know what they're called, shippers? I've never completely understood that. I don't mind that element of the series. I actually think its kind of interesting. That this Hannibal Lecter finds something interesting in this Will Graham character. You can see Hannibal get more and more captivated by Will, who he is and how he thinks, in the beginning of the show (which i am re-watching because... why not?).  I don't think this show was canceled because people said ""this is too different from the books.""  I've recently read Red Dragon for the first time (to get ready for the adaption coming soon) and i read Silence of the Lambs a long time ago, so long that i can't really remember much about the book. (I'll get to why i think it got canceled in a minute.)  To me, this has always been more of a Bryan Fuller show than a Hannibal Lecter show. If you have seen any of his previous works you can see Fuller's DNA all over this thing. That is one reason why i think people shouldn't get so upset with the changes that he was made. This is more fan fiction (I think Bryan Fuller has even said that this is fan fiction at one point or another) than a straight up adaption. The books are always going to be there. The show isn't going to destroy the books in anyway. Its just a different interpretation of a series.  I think the biggest reason why this show was canceled (and you brought up the big point) is that i wasn't accessible to the mainstream audience. But i don't think that is a negative thing at all. I like that this is a very unique, very niche show. I don't think this show should be more mainstream because then it would loose whatever makes this show unique and special. I wouldn't want to see this show dumbed down so the average TV watcher can watch.  Reasons why i think this was canceled...  1) It is dark. It is very psychological and claustrophobic. It can be very violent. Its about a cannibal. Now, i understand why people wouldn't watch this show based on its darkness - it certainly isn't something you would normally see on Network TV - BUT... if fifteen million fucking people can tune in to The Walking Dead which has which has just as much, if not more, violence and darkness and gruesome kills (and people eating people as well. I don't know. Maybe it makes a difference that the people are already dead when they start to feed on the living), then i don't understand why Hannibal is struggling in the ratings. The Walking Dead is a show that seems to try and top itself with its gore. Hannibal seems to top itself with its tableaus but Hannibal's violence serves a purpose, usually in line with the episode's themes. The violence on Hannibal shows how violence can affect people.  2) Its about Hannibal Lecter. Why would people tune into a show about a cannibalistic serial killer? Why would they tune in to a show about Hannibal Lecter if they have already seen the movies? Who could possible play Hannibal Lecter when Anthony Hopkins basically perfected the character?  3) Its on NBC. There is nothing worth watching on network TV.  Like i said before, this is more of a Bryan Fuller show than a Hannibal Lecter show. I can understand why people who love the books might get upset at how Fuller and the writers take things from one book or another but this show kind of stands on its own. The books are there to read to get a better understanding of what the author intended. The movies are there. The show is here."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,Mattyzooks,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:46 2015 UTC,"It should've never aired on NBC.  It's too niche and NBC didn't want to waste money properly advertising it out of fear they'd be losing further money on it. They weren't wrong. Even if they did, I have doubts that the audience ever would've came.  This was always a cable show on a regular network."
HannibalTV,3e1qs3,InspirationMinuit,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"I couldn't have said it better. I completely agree with you on all points. It quite honestly bothers me a lot when they have Hannibal aim a quote from the book which was originally aimed at Clarice, at Will instead. Also, the parts where his backstory was altered severely (concerning Mischa) and when he turned himself in, frustrated me. The first thing that really bothered me, and made me stop watching for a while, was when the teacup was mentioned.  The only reason I still watch at this point, quite honestly, is because of how beautiful it is from an artistic viewpoint."

HannibalTV,3dtaq6,akuma_river,27,Sun Jul 19 07:50:23 2015 UTC,"But I don't think that was about her. That was about Will.  Hannibal for all intents and purposes is done with Alana.   Plus, Hannibal is fond of Margot and she is with Alana. He wouldn't do anything to hurt Alana because that would be rude. She also let him escape and he knows Margot and Alana killed Mason. So as long as he claims their kill as his own he has them in his debt.   I think this was a warning to Alana about Will and what 'saving him' means.  Sure, he saved Will's life. But Hannibal's goal has always been to save Will from his morality and corrupt him to become like Hannibal. It is what he has always desired, a partner who sees, understands, and accepts him for who he is.  So Hannibal is going to 'save' Will and he always keeps his promises."

It kind of makes sense, too, but so does your explanation.   The thing is, it is us vs. them because, when Hannibal told Alana she could leave or die, she stayed. Hannibal never told Will he had to kill him, and he already punished will.  He had protective feelings for Abigail too, so I don't think it really matters.

Still he did it out of revenge and rage. Which is what he regrets, letting his emotions over Will's betrayals make him react in self-destructive ways.  Yeah, I saw that interview. Bryan's not like most TPTB and lies to everyone about the seasons and plans. So now I'm a bit worried. I'm just hoping that Hannibal will be persuaded to let Alana live.  Well, I guess it's better than her disappearing to have gall bladder surgery in Chicago. lol.   I think Hannibal's protective feelings for Abigail was in the way he could manipulate Will.

Besides, Bryan Fuller said that the way this season ends, it wouldn't make sense to go into Silence of the Lambs, even if they did have the rights. The way this season ends will apparently completely redefine the Will/Hannibal relationship. That is what a season 4 would be about - exploring this new area of their relationship. Season 4 would be a total reinvention of the show and be completely different."

I believe I read during season 2 they were discussing the possibility of using the Clarice character and doing the silence of the lambs with MGM, but even if they couldn't get the rights they could just alter the story so it doesn't infringe on the Clarice/Silence storyline. I could be misremembering this though. It's unfortunate it doesn't seem to be going to continue somewhere else.

It may star characters people know but it's either too dark, too gory, too artsy, too whatever.  As good as it is I've never been surprised that it hasn't exploded in popularity. You have to remember that the masses don't always go towards what is excellent, sometimes they just want safe. And Hannibal is far from safe programming."
HannibalTV,3dtt48,McIgglyTuffMuffin,9,Sun Jul 19 12:13:15 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand why so many people watch GoT and American Horror Story then. Don't get me wrong, GoT is a fantastic show, but both are undoubtedly gory (I don't think there been anything as gory as the Mountain and the Viper on Hannibal) and, in the case of AHS, pretty creepy. And unlike AHS, Hannibal has always had significance behind and beauty within all of the deaths along with great character development. I honestly don't think it's the content that repels people from watching Hannibal, it's more that it's relatively unknown. It's really sad. :("
HannibalTV,3dtt48,fitzstreet,3,Sun Jul 19 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"I watch GoT religiously and have seen the first two seasons of AHS. Also I watch Hannibal. To me, the reason GoT and AHS have exploded in popularity and Hannibal never has is because it's so artsy. Violence, disturbed characters, gore, etc. are all shares between the three. However, artsiness is exclusive to Hannibal. GoT is a mostly smart show written with dumb people in mind; a significant minority of people who watch GoT watch for dragons and boobs and not, say, political mishegas in King's Landing. AHS is just a really damn weird show; it is less smartly written than GoT, which is saying something, but is also written with the dumbs in mind. I've only seen the first two seasons of AHS, and I really liked the character work on the show, especially all the nonsense with Bloody Face. But, there are also people who like the sex and guts. My point is that GoT and AHS aren't terribly difficult to understand; things are relatively well spelled-out and clearly defined in those shows. Hannibal, unlike both GoT and AHS, is an explosion of visual metaphors and complex writing. Hannibal is many things, but easy to understand it never has been. It's riddled in artsy-fartsiness that neither GoT nor AHS are.   I think Hannibal's relative unpopularity in relation to GoT's and AHS's almost unexplainably massive popularity is akin to Mad Men's unpopularity and Breaking Bad's massive popularity. Mad Men, like Hannibal, was artsy and metaphorical almost to a fault; Breaking Bad was very, very far from a stupid show, but it had its fans that watched it for the guns and HEISENBERG MURDER TRAIN.   Basically, I think Hannibal is too artsy to be mainstream, but GoT and AGS have artsy elements but are only arts-ish. Pardon the overlong response."

HannibalTV,3dtmro,mytailorisrich,3,Sun Jul 19 09:54:59 2015 UTC,"Great interview. Will did not reject Hannibal out of spite. He just wanted out. By surrendering himself, Hannibal continues to have a hold on on Will. He is not ready to let go."
HannibalTV,3dtmro,helpmeobewan,2,Sun Jul 19 22:18:42 2015 UTC,"This right here:   Will's motivation has always been hard to read. Should we believe him when he says he wants Hannibal out of his life?  Fuller: We come back to that moment in the final episode of the season and break it down between those two characters, and they address it themselves. Will is telling Hannibal, ""I don't need you anymore, I don't want you anymore, I release you."" And Hannibal is saying, ""No you don't. You're telling yourself that. You don't want to know or think about where I am? I am going to give you the knowledge of exactly where I am and let that eat away at you for as long as it takes you to come back into my orbit, and I am patient enough to wait.""   Bryan put it in words I've been trying to find to explain it. The way that Hannibal is going to let that knowledge eat Will until he comes crawling back to him. I wonder how long he thought it would take? What does he think of it being 3 years? Soon or late? And how does he feel on Will getting married?   Does Hannibal surrender to Jack out of spite towards Will or is he once again heartbroken? Does he no longer feel like playing this game without Will as a willing participant?  Fuller: Will realizes that he can't win and Hannibal can't win. So, the only option for him at that moment is to stop playing. That, for Hannibal, is a huge rejection. It's an even stranger rejection than the betrayal of Season 2 because Will has gone into Hannibal's past and understands him better than ever. Will has realized that this is not an evil man, this is just a monster doing what he has always been designed to do essentially. So, he can't give him any more energy. For Will, a magic door presented itself that he could step through and leave Hannibal and all of this behind him. But what Hannibal knows is going to come around again on the cannibal carousel is that that Will can't live without him.   Yep, Hannibal is playing the long game. 'You'll be back, you can't live without me.' Kind of like those sayings of if you love someone/thing let it go and if it comes back then it's meant to be.  This makes me very intrigued:   Finally, it seems like options for a fourth season keep becoming fewer and fewer. Is there still hope left for the show to live on beyond Season 3?  Fuller: It doesn't seem like there is any imminent rescue. But I'm kind of waiting for the show to air its final episodes so that the audience can understand what a fourth season would be like and how this story between these two men would continue. None of the networks the studio has talked to about picking up a fourth season knew how this season was going to end; they were just going off the assumption that it was just going to be another season. And so much changes in the finale of the third season that pays off all of these dynamics between Will and Hannibal that we're talking about - the regret and the betrayal and the wanting to move on and the fear that you might not be capable of moving on. All of those things play out through the Red Dragon arc. After the finale, I'd love to perhaps re-open the conversation with potential networks or streaming options once they clearly understand what the story is that we've told.   Does the mean that season finale is awesome and different that it's instantly going to be buzzed about enough that it will get them picked up for a 4th season in a few years?  Does this mean that Amazon and Netflix rescues might not be as dead as we thought?"
HannibalTV,3dtmro,akuma_river,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:51:59 2015 UTC,"Asking the important questions!   ""What does he think of it being 3 years? Soon or late? And how does he feel on Will getting married?""  Hannibal is patient. He has his mind palace to get lost into when he's bored with what goes on in the real world. And about Will getting married. I don't know, maybe he'll find it funny. Poor Will, trying to fit, getting married, with his dogs, etc   ""Does the mean that season finale is awesome and different that it's instantly going to be buzzed about enough that it will get them picked up for a 4th season in a few years? Does this mean that Amazon and Netflix rescues might not be as dead as we thought?""  You know, when I first read that interview I was devastated because the way I saw it, the talks had stopped and Fuller was hoping to reignite the interest after season 4 is over. But then I started reading other people's reactions to the interview and it seems I might have been too negative. Season finale is awesome? Definitely. Bryan is really excited about it (although Bryan is basically excited about everything Hannibal, lol) and it seems he thinks it will kind of shake things up. And about Amazon and Netflix. Imho, I think chances of them saving Hannibal at the moment are null but maybe in 2017, when Amazon doesn't have the streaming rights, they can talk again with Netflix or others. I still hope that after season 4, somebody else will save it but even if they don't, DeLaurentiis said there are other options and they will all be studied."
HannibalTV,3dtmro,akuma_river,2,Mon Jul 20 12:05:17 2015 UTC,"That's an interesting way to look at it.  'Will, your desire to banish me out of your life is such that you marry the first widow you meet after me? Who has a kid? Is that not what they call a textbook rebound relationship? Is this you trying to put your teacup back together?'  I follow DLC on twitter and people ask questions about it. DLC always says that there are interested parties, talks continue, and that the major issue is the timing of things and getting new contracts. But it's a beloved show and people want to continue it.   I found it very interesting that Bryan mentioned specifically how none of the people they are talking to know the end and he thinks that the season finale will change everything and bring even more interest to the series and what season 4 could bring.  Yeah, what I meant about it increasing chances of Hannibal being saved is that I mean a new contract could be made shortly after the season finale (or later) in which Hannibal comes back for season 4 in 2017. When a) Bryan is free and b) Amazon's contract is up."

What disappoints me most from the books (only read red dragon and silence of the lambs so far) is the relative lack of presence of hannibal in the storyline. He is by far the most fascinating character and I kinda wanted to read more about him.
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,Cosuroso,3,Sun Jul 19 18:53:49 2015 UTC,"Hannibal is more present with each successive book, really."
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,EveryGoodNameIsGone,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:00:31 2015 UTC,"Red Dragon wasn't about Hannibal Lecter, it was about Will Graham."
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,PedroIsWatching,-3,Mon Jul 20 03:00:34 2015 UTC,"Agree. I like the show even more now, but the actual books are not that great."
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,frankerwood,2,Sun Jul 19 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"I read them all in the order of release in the past couple months, watching each film immediately after the book. I even watched Manhunter (Don't. It's such a waste of time.)  I was very impressed with Harris' writing. He leaves a shitload of the story before Red Dragon up to imagination, and even Hannibal Rising doesn't really go into the questions that the other three books beg. He leaves so much out that I was actually blown away that it took over ten years before somebody came along to write a prequel/alternate telling that fills all the gaps.   We constantly hear of the encounter(s) Will and Lecter had, but never the details of the encounter. It was nice to have that gap filled this season."
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,Introvariant,7,Sun Jul 19 20:42:34 2015 UTC,I actually loved Manhunter.
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,schleppylundo,2,Sun Jul 19 20:45:14 2015 UTC,"Me too, and I hated the Ed Norton Red Dragon movie. Manhunter may be cheese but it's cheese with character, and with a much better depiction of the book's Will Graham."
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,Introvariant,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:48:36 2015 UTC,"Really, eh? I didnt love Red Dragon either, but definitely much more than Manhunter. Manhunter felt rushed to me, but I see what you're saying about Will."
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,akuma_river,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:06:29 2015 UTC,Agreed.
HannibalTV,3dtxsx,akuma_river,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:13:05 2015 UTC,"I saw the movies years ago. All but Hannibal Rising.   I just finished reading Red Dragon, it's good, but there's so many questions I have.  Like, what the fuck happened to Will Graham?   Was he shot in addition to being stabbed in the face? Did he really run away from Dolarhyde and let him go after Molly? Where did they find Will? What happened to him after being released from the hospital?  I know his marriage was falling part before the book (you can see where Will is mirroring Molly's needs and wants) and then afterwards it's over. She's done with him.  Then in Silence of the Lambs Crawford tells Clarice how Will's face looks like a Picasso painting...but it doesn't quite match the damage in Red Dragon. And they never really bring up Will again. Like he's completely erased from the series.  Oh and did Hannibal keep mailing things to Will? At the end of Red Dragon Hannibal sends him a letter about Will's hospital stay that Crawford burns. So is that the last Hannibal tries to contact Will?   Seriously, what the fuck happened to Will Graham?   I'm in the process of reading Silence of the Lambs. One thing that really bothers me about the books is the racism and sexism. My god, 'Negros' really?   I know it was taking place in the late 70s and early 80s, but Jesus, it felt like it was the 60s but with a few women characters in male jobs sprinkled about."
HannibalTV,3duor0,RabbitHoleNetwork,2,Sun Jul 19 17:31:17 2015 UTC,Great interview with excellent questions. Fuller is always very articulate and intelligent.  Thanks for posting this!
HannibalTV,3dsu6s,SpottyRasang,2,Sun Jul 19 03:06:31 2015 UTC,I still dont understand why Hannibal surrendered.
HannibalTV,3dsu6s,ilovecaptcha,2,Sun Jul 19 19:38:11 2015 UTC,"Will essentially wanted to break up with him, but Hannibal decided to have a say in that."
HannibalTV,3dsu6s,MimeMachine,2,Sun Jul 19 21:14:14 2015 UTC,"Hannibal commented to Jack ""I want you to know exactly where I am."" This was his decimation of to Will's mindset of ""I will not miss you, I will not think about you, I will not find you."" By deliberately placing himself into Jack's custody, he denies Will his salvation - moving on from Hannibal in the way that Jack has. Additionally, this draws Jack back into Hannibal's sphere of influence.  I think this episode catapults Hannibal's character flaw into the forefront. This ""god"" is afraid of being forgotten, of death, of his own mortality. Which is nicely paralleled by the power struggle over the Verger child. To me, Will is more of Hannibal's son than his romance (""You are just beginning to build your memory palace."") at this point in time. Although the romance was emphasized by the ""teacup"" family, looking back at season 2 through the lens of these new developments it seems like Will and Abigail were filial pursuits rather than romantic ones.  Overall, an amazing episode which thematically tied many things together and I believe marks the shift in attention from plot to character development. Now we get to see how Alana and lady Verger will fare without any of the power players to interact with. I have thus far not cared for Alana's character, but her demand for Hannibal to save Will (""I promise.""\""They know."") has somewhat redeemed her. I hope to see her working together with Margot towards a shared goal rather than just piggybacking on Margot's goals. I expect to see the filial unit further challenged by their relationship in Season 4. (lalala can't hear you it's happening.) I think Margot will begin to manipulate Alana much in the same way that Mason did to her.  I am also interested to see how Jack and Will handle staying in Hannibal's sphere of influence. I think both were rather certain that one of the parties would be dead by now. I'm hoping for the reversed power dynamic between Jack and Hannibal to really shed some light on the character of their persons. We have some really good potential for the actors to unleash some emotion, which seems so pent up at this point even after the Jack's brutalizing of Hannibal and Will's manipulation of Chiho. The only characters that have had their catharsis were Margot and Alana. I think Chiho may return to Will in Hannibal's absence, but that's pure speculation. She looked very sharp in her outfit in this episode and I would love to see her again in similar attire.  ;Oops I typed too much. None of my friends watch this show so this is my only outlet. :)"

HannibalTV,3duvz2,asadPWNS,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:38:24 2015 UTC,"Read the book. Only took me about 4 hours.  Then watch Manhunter, then Red Dragon.   Manhunter has William Petersen playing Will Graham and it's awesome. You can see how much Will is on the edge. However, they play Dolarhyde as typical murder monster.  But it is an 80s artsy version of the book.   Red Dragon has Hopkins and Finnes and they do wonderful performances.   Edward Norton plays it too straight. He's not really playing Will Graham as Will Graham but as typical cop. You don't see how Hannibal gets to Will or how he's on the edge or even how his mind works.  Dolarhyde on the other hand is portrayed as being at war with himself. And is shown as the tragic character he is.  The films also have different endings from the book. And Will's face doesn't really get as messed up as in the book. But the marriage is shown as being on it's last legs.  Since Bryan has stated he wants to focus on Dolarhyde as a tragic character and we already have our Will and Hannibal as the best of the series we can expect the tv to blow the movie versions out of the water."

HannibalTV,3dtm58,Wicelo,25,Sun Jul 19 09:42:42 2015 UTC,"As someone put it, Will feels everyone's emotions, and Hannibal doesn't even feel his own (except when he's with Will, and that's why he's so special to him). I think they are both projecting: Will's projecting his own feelings on Hannibal and Hannibal is projecting his passion for murder on Will. Their relationship is like a focal point which creates their identities. They're melting into each other, as it was shown with their faces. And the final difference between them is what Will said in the last episode.  tl;dr: Will and Hanni are in a relationship & the status is: 'complicated'"

HannibalTV,3dt8gg,akuma_river,5,Sun Jul 19 07:07:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the whole reason it's a firefly is because of the relation to snails.  Some snails can survive being eaten by birds and pooped out and find themselves across the world.  Firefly larvae eat snails.  It's another play on the snake and mongoose from season 1. Will is the snail and Hannibal is the firefly. Or Will is the firefly since he's the mongoose hunting the snake (Hannibal)."

HannibalTV,3dt8gg,puppymehard,4,Sun Jul 19 11:55:42 2015 UTC,"On a similar note, I'm really confused about how Hannibal feels about Will. At the end of last episode he was chopping off his head and was going to eat his brains. Now, he's all sad and broken up that Will's done with him? Why does he care if he was just going to kill him anyway?  It's just frustrating because it's like I have no idea how those 2 characters are actually going to interact when they meet up, and it seems completely random. Maybe I just don't understand them..."
HannibalTV,3dt8gg,kkiiji,3,Sun Jul 19 12:43:57 2015 UTC,"I think that's the whole idea behind the lines about there being no decisive victory, zero sum game and what not. The meaning is that they both developed to a place where they realized that killing each other wasn't the right way to deal with it, that it wasn't going to help them emotionally. As one person wins, the other one loses, they are connected together so as one loses, the other one also loses."

HannibalTV,3dsbtf,PackerBoy,26,Sat Jul 18 23:58:37 2015 UTC,"I would still watch it if I was in your position. Even if the show doesn't get picked up by another network, the creator said that the season finale can serve as a series finale. You won't regret it, it's a damn good show."
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,Walker_Bait05,13,Sun Jul 19 00:16:18 2015 UTC,"If nothing else, you can watch it knowing it doesn't fall off. It is (so far) three near-flawless seasons of some of the best television ever. No X-Files style gradual decline here."
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,divingstation,11,Sun Jul 19 02:15:43 2015 UTC,"Chance of it being cancelled? It has been cancelled. :( It's absolutely still worth getting into though. Though I adore this series, what we've gotten up until now has pretty much been entirely original content (stuff that was not touched upon much in books or at all in movies). The same can't really be said from mid-season 3 onwards. Though it would still be interesting to see Fuller's take on the rest of Hannibal's story, if his version can't continue, this last season isn't a terrible place for it to end."
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,collectsparkles,11,Sun Jul 19 01:31:47 2015 UTC,"Watch it anyway. The characters are great. The story is very interesting. This show really does something very unique with the Hannibal Lecter story. You think you know the story? Think again.  If you're worried about the ending not feeling satisfying, i don't think you should worry. Bryan Fuller knows this was a very low rated show and the chances of it were always pretty high. He has designed each season finale to work as a series finale while also leaving plenty room for story if the season gets picked up. Season 1 had a season/series finale. Oh boy did season 2 have a season/series finale. I hear the same about this (maybe) finale season."
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,bhammer100,6,Sun Jul 19 00:36:16 2015 UTC,It's worth it.

HannibalTV,3dsbtf,EveryGoodNameIsGone,6,Sun Jul 19 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"Still watch it, because the finale of this season is also the finale of Red Dragon.  You won't be left with a cancellation in the middle of nowhere- it ends at a logical point in the story, and this is probably the second best place for it to end (the first being the actual end :) ).  It's a fantastic show."
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,privatecarnage,5,Sun Jul 19 04:34:02 2015 UTC,"Definitely watch it. But watch it from the beginning. It will be way more satisfying that way.   Also, I tell my friends that episode six is where they will start to be hooked. So if you enjoy the first couple of episodes, but don't necessarily feel obsessed, keep watching it."
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,Jameson_Beam,3,Sun Jul 19 07:01:08 2015 UTC,"I started watching because a friend of mine is on it this season, and because I heard it was amazing.  Ive literally only seen these last 7 episodes and am absolutely DEVASTATED it was cancelled."
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,ImGoinDisWaaaay,3,Sun Jul 19 03:26:30 2015 UTC,It stands on its own for the short time the show has been on. This is one of the best TV shows ever to be on television. Plus there is always the slim sliver of hope the show will be back in a few years once the production staff has some time. I would say watch it for sure. I'll be buying the Blurays so I can come back and watch it again in the future.
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,black_pepper,3,Sun Jul 19 03:35:58 2015 UTC,"To add to the rest of the responses, this is a show worth watching regardless of the cancellation (which is not absolutely permanent). Bryan Fuller has put an entirely unique spin on the Hannibal Lecter saga, and each season reaches its own satisfying conclusion. The acting is some of the best I’ve seen on T.V, let alone basic cable. And the cinematography and the score are breathtakingly gorgeous. If you're going to give one show a shot that is getting the axe, make it this one. You won't regret it!"
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,glasscode,2,Sun Jul 19 04:39:19 2015 UTC,"Watch it anyway. There are at least three solid seasons. Every episode is worth your time. Besides, it might not be cancelled for good."
HannibalTV,3dsbtf,yourmatchmyfire,0,Sun Jul 19 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"I think with Red Dragon happening this season, this is a pretty complete story. If you think about it, this sums up the Will Graham storyline as a whole, unless I'm wrong and Red Dragon was meant to extend past the season finale.   I always found the Will Graham/Hannibal Lecter dynamic more interesting than Clarice Starling. Will is almost like the superego to Hannibal's ego, where maybe Dolarhyde is the id. Will can understand their minds and their desires, but he keeps himself more or less grounded in a moral code. Getting three seasons just to dive into his character was great for me.   Yes, I want more of the show. Like everyone does. But all things considered with the timing of the cancellation, I think things could have gone a lot worse. I'll leave after the third season with at least some semblance of closure."

HannibalTV,3dt7v2,MisterLyle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:16:29 2015 UTC,"I know Hannibal's all for metaphors and cryptic language, but this seems like a super unnecessarily weird way to say it, right? I mean, not even in an ""I'm super intellectual and artsy Hannibal""-style but more like a high-schooler trying to impress a girl."
HannibalTV,3dt7v2,g2gen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:19:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right, and I actually think most of his dialogue is like that. Most this season, anyway. I liked the nostalgic feel of the line, ""Let's talk about time and relativity and teacups"" (or however it went), because it seemed like a half-apolgetic, half-melancholic way to bring up a previous conversation, right? It wasn't trying to be super-poetic, so unlike your example and the one I'll bring up in a sec, it actually sounded a bit like how someone might talk.   But the Bedelia and Hannibal conversations at the start of the season?  ""My killing Sogliato now would not preserve the peace.""  ""Your peace is without morality.""  ""Morality doesn't exist. Only morale.""  That is high-school level 'deepness.' First off, it was about killing a guy. He says he won't because it ""won't preserve the peace."" What other point is there to saying ""Your peace is without morality."" after this than to appear deep with no reason? Even among the artsy scholars types in the show there are certain lines to cross where it no longer fits with an idea of how such a person might realistically respond, and when it holds no bearing on the conversation, that is one such time, as this was. Even in-universe it didn't seem a realistic conversation, I mean.   And then, ""There is no morality. Only morale.""  Both these last two lines are a complete non-sequitur and unlike season two they do not flow naturally from the conversation (as good friends would talk, crossing threads of conversation).  But I mean, at least this conversation with Chiyoh was a heart-to-heart between old friends. People can get poetic on such occasion, so I can forgive it that.  But you're right, still high-schooler poeticism."

HannibalTV,3dt8hq,IBMflamingo,7,Sun Jul 19 05:54:32 2015 UTC,"Hannibal's central premise has always been that he and Will are the same, meaning that Will is a killer at his core. But at the same time, Will has built a life away from Hannibal: this is something Hannibal, like any vengeful ex, will want to prove is just an overcompensation for the lack of Hannibal in Will's life. Ending of Red Dragon will play out more or less the same - Dollarhyde launches his attack on the Grahams, but in this scenario I think it's important that Will take on the takedown aspect rather than be injured and helpless (otherwise it functions too similarly to the Season 2 finale). I'm betting it will be a tense cat and mouse game around the house, which culminates in Will being wounded but managing to kill Dollarhyde (who may already be injured severely by Molly). But the cost will be Will's family. Either they are killed by Dollarhyde, or the way Will dispatches him will be so horrific that they leave him.   Personally, I'd love it if the last line of the season was a callback to Season 2 where Will is in therapy with Hannibal and says ""You don't want anyone in my life but you.""  Hannibal's only response: ""I only want what's best for you."""
HannibalTV,3dt8hq,Sempere,12,Sun Jul 19 08:19:45 2015 UTC,"As much as I like Will, I'd really like the finale to be Will waking up in the hospital after getting his face sliced up, his wife telling him she's leaving him, and Jack Crawford apologizing, profusely. He hands him an envelope, from Hannibal.   Will doesn't open it. However, Hannibal reads it off in a voice over. It's subtly apologetic for his involvement in Will's situation. He hopes Will would come see him, soon.   The present scenes show Will contemplating opening the letter. But ultimately setting it on fire. Zero music, just Hannibal's words of admiration, and respect. We get a slow motion burning of the letter shot, as the fire burns through the envelope and reveals Hannibal's signature, which then becomes distorted and burned by the flames. We see the scenes depicted, as such, Will retires to fixing boat motors, he experiences frequent nightmares, and drinks heavily to quell the pain.   Hannibal has been removed from his lavish cell, and placed in the familiar cell made of brick, with just a bed a small shelf, a table, and a toilet. Chilton smiles with sinister glee from the other side of the glass. However, Hannibal smiles and nods to the orderly standing next to Chilton, who seems uneasy abouf his bosses attitude, nametag reads ""Barney"".   Jack starts teaching. He feels intense regret for what happened to Will. In one of his forensic classes, he poses a question the class, and a few kids raise their hands, he calls to one, and looks down at a clipboard of names, ""Yes, Miss... Starling."" Young girl answers the question in a really unqie and smart way, Jack Crawford looks very impressed. Cue credits."
HannibalTV,3dt8hq,Lecter07,2,Sun Jul 19 06:28:21 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  There are still talks going on about season 4.   It's not Bryan's fault. His plan was to do both Hannibal and American Gods when NBC declined a season 4 he was contractually obligated to put AG first.  And AG was just one of several reasons why Amazon passed. They haven't said what the others are but they did say that the 18 month wait was one of the reasons why Amazon passed.  As for the ending, I think it will end similar to the books and movies in which Will is scarred and his marriage is falling apart."
HannibalTV,3dt8hq,akuma_river,0,Sun Jul 19 06:22:41 2015 UTC,"First of all, can we please stop bashing Fuller?! He's not done anything wrong here. ""akuma_river""'s post is spot on as to why.  Second, one detail that will crop up in the finale is here: ---> http://www.tvguide.com/news/hannibal-postmortem-digestivo-bryan-fuller-season-3  WILL'S MOTIVATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN HARD TO READ. SHOULD WE BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS HE WANTS HANNIBAL OUT OF HIS LIFE?  Fuller: We come back to that moment in the final episode of the season and break it down between those two characters, and they address it themselves. Will is telling Hannibal, ""I don't need you anymore, I don't want you anymore, I release you."" And Hannibal is saying, ""No you don't. You're telling yourself that. You don't want to know or think about where I am? I am going to give you the knowledge of exactly where I am and let that eat away at you for as long as it takes you to come back into my orbit, and I am patient enough to wait.""  DOES HANNIBAL SURRENDER TO JACK OUT OF SPITE TOWARDS WILL OR IS HE ONCE AGAIN HEARTBROKEN? DOES HE NO LONGER FEEL LIKE PLAYING THIS GAME WITHOUT WILL AS A WILLING PARTICIPANT?  Fuller: Will realizes that he can't win and Hannibal can't win. So, the only option for him at that moment is to stop playing. That, for Hannibal, is a huge rejection. It's an even stranger rejection than the betrayal of Season 2 because Will has gone into Hannibal's past and understands him better than ever. Will has realized that this is not an evil man, this is just a monster doing what he has always been designed to do essentially. So, he can't give him any more energy. For Will, a magic door presented itself that he could step through and leave Hannibal and all of this behind him. But what Hannibal knows is going to come around again on the cannibal carousel is that that Will can't live without him.)"

HannibalTV,3doxq6,lightabigfire,3,Sat Jul 18 20:07:14 2015 UTC,"My personal favorite is En Kort En Lang, but it's not for everyone. It's basically a really soppy romantic comedy but I really enjoyed it.    A Royal Affair should probably be your go-to film, though. Historical drama set in the 18th century. Really a fantastic movie, tied with The Hunt for his best acting. Mads plays the doctor of Denmark's (really rather ill) King and his wife. The film also stars Alicia Vikander, which is never a bad thing!  Adam's Apples was also pretty good (though it's been a while since I watched it) - Mads plays a priest rehabilitating a Neo-Nazi. Some interesting religious themes, very odd ending.   The Door is one of his lesser known efforts, and the plot doesn't make much sense, but it's actually a pretty enjoyable movie.  After the Wedding was very enjoyable, and actually lost out on the Academy Award in 2006 to one of my favorite films. An interesting drama/romance, and Mads played it wonderfully.   Flame & Citron also has Mads' brother, Lars (who is also a really good actor, and had a really good role in The Killing), and it's a good movie if you enjoy art-house and historical films (specifically, WWII and the Nazi occupation of Denmark).  Those are the major ones, which you should probably watch first. Once you've watched those, you could probably work your way through the rest of his filmography. I've watched it all, and some films are more boring than others (King Arthur, Clash of the Titans, The Three Musketeers, and Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky all put me to sleep...), some are intriguing but pretty heavy (Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself, Pusher I/II, Bleeder, Flickering Lights), and some are interesting for their context in Danish cinema (Open Hearts, for example, is a prime example of the Dogme 95 school of filmmaking). Also notable is The Green Butchers, where he plays a cannibal.   There's more, of course, but I've just realised how long this is... if you have any questions, feel free to ask. I've watched pretty much everything he's been in (or, everything I could find) and know some about Danish cinema in general."

I didn't feel a single twinge of guilt downloading episode 7.  Even if I wasn't planning on watching it again on Saturday night as it airs.  (Which I am).  Nobody's entitled to anything, but ""you're stealing, not supporting""?  There are very few ways many of us could support the show more.  Have whatever opinions you want about the legality and morality of torrenting, but that's a really shitty accusation to make when your only point of context is ""This person watched it two days earlier than NBC intended them to""."

HannibalTV,3donn2,IBMflamingo,0,Sat Jul 18 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"When a series has low viewership and rave reviews, it means the show isn't being advertised enough, and from the start it was always in a bad timeslot because of its' graphic nature. All of these things, directly decided by NBC, were responsible for lower viewership. NBC only picked up the series so that the DeLaurentis company could say they've had business dealings with an Americam company. It increases their reputation overseas. But, I'm the ignorant one.

HannibalTV,3dpw3o,TheJessicaProblem,11,Sat Jul 18 08:02:41 2015 UTC,"Hannibal likes to be the orchestrator of the game.  He's also insane, despite everything feeling so organised.  I felt there there was incredible honesty in those to scenes.  Will stating that he 'tolerates'.  He was willing to tolerate for Hannibal.  (Bedelia I think, wants to be able to tolerate).  Hannibal always stated that he let Will 'see him'.  He knows if he leaves he cannot return and Will will not seek him.  So he chooses to remain where he will be a presence, knowing Will will eventually return."
HannibalTV,3dpw3o,Kimchidiary,3,Sat Jul 18 08:36:56 2015 UTC,"Bedelia is a bit of a twisted creature. She is driven by her curiosity to learn and understand Hannibal, especially when given the chance to do ""in the wild"".  She does get a thrill from all the danger, all the deception, and the fact she knows she is playing a dangerous game with Hannibal.  I think she recognized something in Hannibal that she also recognize in herself, however, Bedelia doesn't really want to hurt people or kill people, but her sense of self preservation and curiosity allow her to look past whatever her actions that are less than ""good"" or ""right"". I think Hanibal absolutely respects her and adores her. Helikes her mind, and the fact she is willing and perfectly capable of going toe to toe with him.  Every time Bedelia throws shade at Hannibal (including the first two seasons), to me it shows Bedelia is always Hannibal's psychiatrist first.  It's been a fascinating dynamic, and the actors are just so well matched in every aspect.  I hope we will see more of them interacting n the present in future episodes."
HannibalTV,3dpw3o,4fannibal,3,Sat Jul 18 14:11:40 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents on why Hannibal didn't kill Will after Muskrat Farm: We saw in Dolce that Hannibal could have killed Will quite a few times before the head saw came out. He could have killed him anytime after Will got shot and then kept the body to eat, but that wasn't what Hannibal wanted. He wanted a ""nice"" sit down dinner between him, Jack and Will where they would all enjoy Will's brain together. I think that this scenario was important to Hannibal, since he put so much effort into setting it up (and the dialogue of the scene seems to support that it's a kind of act of closure between the three of them). It may be the case that just killing Will without any ""gravitas"" or symbolism to the death is unpalatable to him. I don't think that Hannibal completely changed his mind about wanting to kill and eat Will, just that the situation in which it would be feasible for him to do the way that he wanted was gone and he wasn't willing to settle for some quicky in regards to the death of one of the most important people in his life.  So instead he sets up a situation where he's forced Will to still have him in his life, and maybe the opportunity for Hannibal will arise again even if he has to wait. Or maybe he'll change his mind.  Just some thoughts."
HannibalTV,3dpw3o,stampedes,2,Sat Jul 18 15:42:41 2015 UTC,This whole goddamn show is giving me Stockholm syndrome
HannibalTV,3dpw3o,TransparentBurqa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"Specifically in response to your questions about Hannibal's change of heart: a lot of people on this sub have talked about how Hannibal's surrender was a way to stay within Will's orbit. And I definitely agree, but I also think a lot of it has to do with the promise he made to Alana to save Will. As he states, he always keeps his promises, so from that point on he was bound to his own sense of honour not to kill Will. And then, when he and Will talk, he comes to realize that their relationship is a zero-sum game (or, Will sees it that way, at least). In other words, if one wins, the other must lose. Hannibal can no longer play by those rules, due to his promise to Alana, and thus must find a new way to approach the game. One in which they have the possibility of interacting non-violently, and he can continue to influence and interact with Will."
HannibalTV,3dpw3o,khaibit_fhtagn,0,Sat Jul 18 14:54:47 2015 UTC,"Bedelia's arc will continue through Red Dragon. We'll learn more about her then.  Hannibal can never leave Will alone unless Will is dead. And he can't kill Will like he was planning- he promised Alana that, and breaking a promise is rude. So he turned himself in to haunt Will more effectively."
HannibalTV,3dr074,RoninKengo,3,Sat Jul 18 16:51:26 2015 UTC,This was a great review and the other Hannibal ones (I've read them all) are beautifully written. Thanks so much for sharing - I didn't know this site existed.
HannibalTV,3dpfes,AllureFX,20,Sat Jul 18 04:27:45 2015 UTC,"Probably the most uneven arc since season 1, but also with some of the highest highs and best moments of the entire series (Hannibal getting his ass kicked, Will getting Krendler'd, the heart-man-stag). I think they spent a bit too much time dawdling in the first few episodes and then tried to pack too much into the last few, but ""Digestivo"" and ""Aperitivo"" were A+, essentially flawless episodes that rival ""Mizumono"" for me."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,divingstation,2,Sat Jul 18 06:44:19 2015 UTC,"i agree with you, but for my taste the episodes had a little bit too many art-scenes. I would have prefered a bit less, even when each scene of these were phenominal."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,panix199,25,Sat Jul 18 15:35:34 2015 UTC,"For me, the show has been on a continuous climb since S1 -- the upcoming story arc is going to bring it to a whole new level >:D."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,HorrorFancy,7,Sat Jul 18 04:49:51 2015 UTC,"Yes!  I think most people got ticked because they wanted the police procedural/solving crimes bit of the show again. They don't understand that it was just a plot device for Hannibal and Will to meet and then build their relationship, the betrayal, and so forth.  This first part of the season was all about what Hannibal did to everyone and how it changed them plus how Hannibal MISSED Will. My god, he was more emoy than a lovestruck teenager having their first heartbreak.  He was happy in Italy so why did he destroy it by killing people and bringing attention? He missed Will that's why.  Plus, I think he was bored.   He was ready to surrender to Will in the gallery before Chiyoh shot Will. So his surrender here isn't surprising.   Will may say he's done with Hannibal (I still swear I heard the melody to 'Somebody I Used to Know' playing during their breakup) but Hannibal will MAKE Will come to him and care once again. In the meantime he will find new ways to amuse himself. Such as fucking with Chilton's mind in the mental institute. Maybe he thinks it will bring him closer to Will to experience the same thing as him?  Red Dragon has me pumped. I finally got my hands on the book and I'm reading it. It's very interesting to see how similar and dissimilar the Will Grahams are.  I am very worried about Will's face. I really hope Francis won't do it. I'm sorry, it's shallow and such but Will is just too pretty!"
HannibalTV,3dpfes,akuma_river,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:00:58 2015 UTC,pretty sure in silence of the lambs book it was noted that Hannibal did that to Will's face and Will went to live out the rest of his days in Florida.
HannibalTV,3dpfes,jonaldjuck,4,Sat Jul 18 16:17:23 2015 UTC,Hannibal carved up Will's stomach but Francis Dolarhyde is the one who carved up Will's face.
HannibalTV,3dpfes,akuma_river,11,Sat Jul 18 20:10:16 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved the arc; the way they explored it was like an art film all in suggestion and psychology. I understand why that could be frustrating for some (especially when we got news of the cancellation and it felt like little narrative ground was being covered), but I was totally on board.   I think its worth noting too how it will playback on rewatches of the entire series - it makes total sense to spend time in the characters' emotional fallout from the s2 finale (and the events of s1&2 as a whole), and in retrospect I think it will feel natural instead of just roaring into a new season with everyone gunning for Hannibal."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,Hutchersans,3,Sat Jul 18 09:52:42 2015 UTC,I agree that it will make more sense when we re-watch the entire series from start to finish. I think it will also be better when we don't have to wait a week in between episodes.
HannibalTV,3dpfes,bhammer100,3,Sat Jul 18 11:37:46 2015 UTC,"I found it to be the best so far. It might have to do something with the fact I binge-watched first 4 episodes and got addicted to the atmosphere of the season very quickly, and the latest episode ""Digestivo"" was just pure brilliance.   It was a roller-coaster from beginning to end. On a scale from 1 to 5, S1 would be a 4+ for me, S2 a 5 and S3 a 5 as well. I really can't wait for Red Dragon. I have no doubts when it comes to Hannibal in regards to how good it will be."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,Seroton1n,3,Sat Jul 18 13:21:18 2015 UTC,"I thought it had a lot of potential, but it felt rushed and they squandered it."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,Riekopo,9,Sat Jul 18 22:26:49 2015 UTC,"Worst so far. It's still great and it has great scenes and character interactions, but the storytelling wasn't going anywhere. Season 1 was Will descending into madness. Season 2 was Will escaping that, trying to catch Hannibal and falling even further into his net.  This first half of Season 3 I don't think was specially satisfying in any sense, I enjoyed it, it was mostly Hannibal playing around but the rest of the characters had no point of their own. Chio, Bedilia and Jack had great scenes but their story didn't go anywhere. Will basically doesn't have any remarkable event happen to him, he just decides to change at the end pretty much randomly, he is caught into Hannibal's net until he is not. The Berger plotline was ok, but it was pretty much everybody acting stupid and still getting what they wanted because the opposite was even more stupid. Berger missed  Hannibal's capture a few times, but Hannibal was acting even more stupid so he ended up catching him. But then he got lucky and he ended up escaping.  So it was ok, but I can imagine skipping these episodes on a rewatch, except the last one."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,empty_place,2,Sat Jul 18 14:01:11 2015 UTC,"The slow start has been completely revoked in my mind, even just all of the establishing shots of Italy that I felt did nothing but act as filler. I should have had more faith in the show, but I've been burned so badly by shows losing their quality before! Everything is still so vivid in my mind, the beautiful colours, the tremulous relationships, the wealth of characters introduced and...subsequently killed.  Just think about how much they managed to introduce and satisfactorily retire in seven episodes. Some of it may have been fraught - Alana's new personality comes to mind, as it was discarded fairly quickly and never set its roots - but for the most part it was beautifully done!  This series, and this season, have a very special place in my heart, and I think outside of any arts-y, any analytical reviews, it can just be said that it was fantastically fun to watch and be moved by!"
HannibalTV,3dpfes,CyberDoakes,2,Sat Jul 18 14:06:27 2015 UTC,"Bit mixed. I loved all of Hannibal's scenes. It was great to see him being so carefree and his relationship with Bedelia was such a delight. I don't I've ever laughed so much at this show than I did in episode 3 - ""technically, you killed him"". Also, enjoyed almost everything to do with Mason, Alana, and Jack. Jack going stone cold on Hannibal's candy ass was wonderful.   However, I thought some of Will's scenes were quite poor in comparison. I only found Chiyo and Pazzi half interesting once they got away from Will. I never used to skipped through parts of episodes, but when I rewatched episode 3 where Will stalks Chiyo, I found myself skipping through a lot of it. Once he ran into Jack in Italy I started enjoying his scenes again.   It's probably my second least favourite group of episodes (my least favourite being the first four or five episodes of season 1). But saying that, the only episodes which I didn't love were episode 2 and 3, but they were still decent chunks of those episodes I thought were brilliant.   TL;DR - Even when Hannibal is not at its best, it's still great. 8.5/10."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,AnIrrationalSkeptic,2,Sat Jul 18 17:55:36 2015 UTC,"I'd give it an 8 compared to general television. Compared to seasons 1 and 2 I'd give it a 4. Slightly below average for the show in my opinion, and didn't live up to the amazing season 2 finale, which, to be fair, probably set the bar way too high.  The first few episodes were too artsy and I didn't feel like all those shots really set up moments in later episodes like I felt about most of the artsy shots from the first two seasons.  The whole arc just felt sort of surreal to me. The first two seasons felt grounded by Will/Jack working on cases beyond the Chesapeake Ripper. In S3 it just feels like the cast is randomly wandering around Italy/Europe and having deep/cryptic conversations with eachother which are great here and there as they were in the first two seasons, but it felt like thats all this season has been so far and that's disappointing for me."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,Imago90,2,Sun Jul 19 01:45:47 2015 UTC,"For me, at the moment, it's the worst arc the show has shown us. But I'm prepared to change my answer in the future when I rewatch/own the bluray. It was slow and plodded along and just too artsty for it's time slot. I think, for me, the show may work better if I sit and watch multiple episodes at a time. I need to complete picture at once, not in chunks.  That said, episode 7 is probably my second favorite episode of the entire series right after the season 2 finale."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,McIgglyTuffMuffin,2,Sat Jul 18 12:44:06 2015 UTC,"D. Episodes 1-5 essentially killed the series. Too much style and little plot. The last two episodes were great, though"
HannibalTV,3dpfes,bravesgeek,5,Sat Jul 18 04:57:00 2015 UTC,"There was a lot of substance. Sure, the plot was slow and got kicked into overdrive with episode 4/5, but god forbid we explore the characters after the season 2 fallout."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,bhammer100,4,Sat Jul 18 11:39:16 2015 UTC,"What did we really learn about any of the characters following from S2? I'm honestly curious to hear your opinion. It felt like to me, Will was the only character that was involved who got any real focus and his characterization was all across the board the entire time. I suppose you could say we explored Hannibal's character too but other than learning he's still real deep into will I don't know what else they really touched on."
HannibalTV,3dpfes,stampedes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:51:28 2015 UTC,"For Hannibal, we only got glimpses into his history. We know he ate Mischa but apparently didn't kill her. He also manipulated (to what extent we don't know) Chiyoh.  I agree with you that Will was the biggest character we got to see develop so far. There was the scene with Jack and Will in Will's garage or whatever (episode 4 i believe). I can't remember the exact conversation off the top of my head. There was also the scene where Will says there will always be a part of him that will want to run off with Hannibal. I think Will was in control these last few episodes. He was going to use the knife (when he got shot by chiyoh) to finally cut that part of him. But the closer he got to Hannibal the more he became confused and the deeper into darkness he went.  I would say Alana got some good development post S2. We found that she has a hard streak in her. That she is open to working for a bad guy if it means she can capture Hannibal. She's even open for a little torture.  Jack seems to be the character that has changed the least post S2. Although i think that says more about the character than the writing.  As for Chiyoh... i like that she is a mystery... that she was manipulated by Hannibal to some extent... but with the shortened and somewhat rushed first half we never really got to know her. Same with Pazzi.  Bedelia looks like she will be coming back in some form."

HannibalTV,3dpfes,chrisjdgrady,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:56:13 2015 UTC,"I loved this first half. It wasn't perfect. I wish we had spent a little more time on Chiyoh and Inspector Pazzi. But i loved the first two episodes and how they explored our two main characters. Then starting with 3 then more so with 4 then 5,6 and 7 being some of the best of the season/series (especially 6 and 7).  Overall i would rate this first half a B/B+.  I would rate season 1 a B+/A-  I would rate season 2 an A  I can easily see this season getting an A- if the Red Dragon is fantastic."

HannibalTV,3dpfes,Thestigsfatcousin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:30:01 2015 UTC,"I loved the first 3 episodes, because it was like a beautiful, terrible dream and the character development was so finely tuned. It was something I could savor. Episode 4 felt a bit like an infodump, but it was okay. I loved the last few episodes, very exciting and intense. Lots of emotions, too.  However, put all together, the pacing feels weird. So much time was taken in the first episodes and suddenly everything is happening at once, so it feels a bit rushed in contrast. This past episode, especially. I wanted to see Hannibal and Will saying something to each other before their ""breakup."" Something that explained how Hannibal went from deciding to eat Will's brains to wanting their teacup to come back together. And after building up Muskrat Farm so much, Hannibal barely sweat. It was all smiles through his escape, and it felt like they were only there for a day, when it was supposed to be prolonged.  I feel like they might have had a lot more that they wanted to show us in this arc that would have helped build character nuances and tensions, but they ran out of time for it near the end."

HannibalTV,3dpfes,helpmeobewan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:09:05 2015 UTC,"The first 3 episodes were pretty good, I absolutely loved how the survivors of Mizumono were kept unknown and revealed individually - lords almighty, the Will/Abigail contrast scene was so beautifully done, and definitely among my favorites in terms of the cinematography.   However, for me I kinda got bored during middle episodes (4 & 5) because of the lack of plot progression and just not much action going on, mainly dialogue and artsy shots. I put off watching E5 and 6 but got back on track when E7 releasde. (which I was actually kinda glad I did because of the huge ass E6 cliffhanger :P)  Hannibal's gone back to being stellar past 2/3 episodes though, probably some of the best in the entire series, so that's awesome :D  Overall: 8.5/10"

HannibalTV,3dpq45,anotheronedown,8,Sat Jul 18 06:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yes absolutely. The show is either original material, a ""remix"" or expansion of the source material. Though, we still don't know how closely Red Dragon will follow the book. That's the only thing  that may be a close adaptation."
HannibalTV,3dpq45,thegreekie,14,Sat Jul 18 06:47:22 2015 UTC,"I think being at least familiar with the novels heightens the appreciation for the show, as you'd be surprised how much stuff they get in. I'd crack open one of the books, looking to track down a specific reference and happen upon something else I had forgotten about that made it into the show. You can tell how much respect and adoration Fuller has for the source material and makes you eager to see how they're going to put their own spin on something you know is right around the corner."
HannibalTV,3dpq45,Mor-Tax,9,Sat Jul 18 07:17:38 2015 UTC,"Oh yes. You'll be catching lines of dialogue directly lifted from the book, often given to other characters. It's like an easter egg hunt.   Freddy Lounds is a dude, Alan Bloom is a dude, so characterizations are quite different. Even Will's characterization is quite a bit different. His level of snark is through the roof. He is sassy as fuck and tired of everyone's shit, I love book!Will. He accidentally dirty talked to Jack Crawford over the phone because he thought his wife was calling (back in the days of no caller ID). He also talks about the story of when he stole a watermelon in his youth and his balls retracted as he jumped over a barbed-wire fence.  tl;dr yes, please read the books!"
HannibalTV,3dpq45,pajamasecrets,2,Sat Jul 18 08:46:13 2015 UTC,"I think it was Byron Metcalf, the lawyer running probate on the Jacobis' estate. Will expected Molly and answered by calling her Hotlips (which just makes me think of M*A*S*H*). I could be wrong, but I just finished Red Dragon for the first time a couple days ago. Also: reading that book makes me so look forward to seeing what they do with it."
HannibalTV,3dpq45,Psychopath-,4,Sat Jul 18 17:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. They're radically different. Seasons 1 and 2 are TV-original (well, the Mason S2 stuff is backstory in the third novel). Season 3A (eps 1-7) is a very loose adaptation of Hannibal (third novel) moved much earlier in the timeline without Clarice, and season 3B (eps 8-13) will be an adaptation of Red Dragon (first novel), but with Will and Hannibal having a much, much, much closer pre-incarceration relationship on the show than in the book.  The Silence of the Lambs (book 2) is nowhere to be found in the show, as the production company doesn't have the rights to it or its original characters (which is why Clarice isn't in the show). Hannibal Rising (book 4, a prequel) had some of its plot used as backstory in season 3 with the talk of Mischa (Hannibal's sister). It's pretty universally regarded as a terrible book, though."
HannibalTV,3dpq45,EveryGoodNameIsGone,2,Sun Jul 19 03:22:46 2015 UTC,I'm in the midst of reading Red Dragon now. It's interesting. I've seen both Manhunter and The Red Dragon (not recently though) and I'm seeing more book Will Graham in Hugh's portrayal than I did in the movies.

HannibalTV,3dm5wi,hitalec,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes it is. And who's watching streams? People who can't figure out how torrents or cloud sharing work?"
HannibalTV,3do8dm,d_snizzy,6,Fri Jul 17 21:53:57 2015 UTC,"Good catch. When he said that to Alanna I immediately thought she was going to be dead before the end of the episode. In this show dialogue is NEVER thrown away. It WILL become important. Unless he meant emotionally kill her, in which a case could be made is something he had done."
HannibalTV,3do8dm,JaxTeller718,2,Fri Jul 17 22:42:51 2015 UTC,"I thought he was going to find her at the end of the episode after he rescues Will and be all like ""I always keep my promises"" and kill her, but I guess he's going to do it somehow via the Tooth Fairy or after he escapes in the Silence of the Lambs story."
HannibalTV,3do8dm,thegreekie,2,Fri Jul 17 22:55:03 2015 UTC,I think that he's going to have Dolarhyde kill Alana instead of book spoiler.
HannibalTV,3do8dm,ink1026,2,Sat Jul 18 01:34:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, it makes more sense within the show's canon than introducing more characters we're not emotionally attached to for the sole purpose of killing them off."
HannibalTV,3do8dm,JPS_TEAM_B_6905,2,Sat Jul 18 01:41:35 2015 UTC,"Plus they already did that wheelchair scene in season 2, and I doubt they'll repeat it."
HannibalTV,3do8dm,ink1026,3,Sat Jul 18 01:43:53 2015 UTC,Well Fuller teased the idea that maybe they planted the idea in his head? It was cheeky of them to fake that so he might try to organize an even more elaborate version of it instead.
HannibalTV,3do8dm,orangewaxlion,2,Sat Jul 18 02:12:27 2015 UTC,He didn't promise to kill her. He told her to run.  Alana lied when she told Mason that Hannibal promised to kill her. This was so that Mason would trust her while she and Margot prepared to kill him.
HannibalTV,3do8dm,divingstation,3,Sat Jul 18 09:25:08 2015 UTC,"Words I do remember are roughly  ""Be blind Alana, don't be brave. If you leave now I'll make no plans to call on you, but if you stay - I will kill you""  And then she tries to shoot him  I just can't remember if he specifically said promise or not."

I'd say those aren't Will's notes, but Hannibal's, and this is a reference to the scene in the books where he rescues Clarice.   You may recall his obsession with the teacup - he drops the teacup to the ground and hopes it will put itself back together and ""Mischa...to be whole again"". In that vein, in the books he does work related to this; I'll quote the book: ""...he sits in his armchair with a big pad of butcher paper doing calculations. The pages are filled with the symbols of both astrophysics and particle physics. There are repeated efforts with the symbols of string theory. The few mathematicians who could follow him might say his equations begin brilliantly and then decline, doomed by wishful thinking: Dr. Lecter wants time to reverse."""

First episode 406.000 viewers (that is 4,5% of Sweden's population), second episode around 250k and third 125k. The channel decided to freeze it for a month and a half because of the bad viewership and put it back on 9.55 pm. Then for the next season it was 10.30 pm and this season it is 10 pm and has been moved to the network's lesser known channel with even worse viewership numbers as a result.  Last episode got 16k viewers."

HannibalTV,3dmyoh,TransparentBurqa,3,Sat Jul 18 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"I wonder about this too. I'm from Brazil and the third season only now started here, which is pretty annoying. I watch it on TV because I like to rewatch the episodes but of course, I always download the episodes when they come out. There are two podcasts about tv shows that I always listen to, and in both podcasts, people said that Hannibal does well outside of the US. I tried finding any evidence of this and couldn't find anything though. It'd be interesting to know."

HannibalTV,3dmyoh,Re4pr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:06:45 2015 UTC,"I think one of the main issues is how long it takes for rights of a show to leave the border. The show runs about a season behind what it does in the USA in all other countries AFAIK.   I honestly can not restrain myself from watching more episodes when I know they're just a button click away. The pilot airing on belgian television was actually how I came to learn of the show. I reeled in every single episode that was out, they were past half of S2 already when the pilot aired here. I don't think they even show it on TV anymore here, or at least not atm. Maybe they'll air S02E01 in a few months :')  edit: also feels kind of shit, since this show is the pinnacle of modern cinema and I'm not contributing anything towards it's profits or continuation. Not to mention all the others who torrent. I'd seriously donate 50€ to fullers pay-pall or whatever the sort. It's just stupid."

HannibalTV,3dmyoh,Re4pr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:46:59 2015 UTC,"Valid point. Fuller and his team really have created something rare and very special.   Out of curiosity, do DVR recordings contribute to the ratings of the show? If not, I'll feel really bad for not doing my part to support the show."

I knew she was a stellar actress, but this was beyond that. What a performance. Also, I think Fuller came up with the perfect way to have Hannibal caught - spiting Will, while extending an olive branch for the future.  What an absolutely incredible episode."

I agree. It was beautifully written and executed. So surprising that Hannibal surrendered, yet gloriously satisfying. Bravo, Fuller!!  (AND we got to see Hannibal rescue Will like Hopkins' Hannibal did with Clarice in the Hannibal movie. That was lovely.)"
HannibalTV,3dlsv8,d007h8,4,Fri Jul 17 13:08:32 2015 UTC,"Did Hannibal surrender voluntarily? Chiyo was pointing a gun at him, so she could have been forcing him to do it? Which would contradict what she said to him, that she didn't want to see him in a cage?"
HannibalTV,3dlsv8,mathau,16,Fri Jul 17 13:41:59 2015 UTC,"She just watched him surrender, and maybe made sure that he isn't attacked. I could see her going on a rampage against the cops.  Hannibal did ask her: ""Would you watch over me?"""

HannibalTV,3dlsv8,d007h8,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:11:04 2015 UTC,Someone else mentioned the iron + silver quote; they said it was from the books.  Anyone else know the significance of this?
HannibalTV,3dlsv8,mathau,9,Fri Jul 17 15:25:28 2015 UTC,"In the novels, Hannibal writes it in a letter to Clarice. Clarice is from a poor West Virginian working-class background, and is ashamed of it; the fact that she's awkwardly trying to hide her accent is one of the first things he notices about her. In his letter, Hannibal tells her to dig out the old iron skillet that all Southern mountain girls must have and to gaze into it while reflecting on the values her parents had and what they would think of her attempting to climb the FBI bureaucracy.    Was a big federal career your hope or theirs? How much would your father bend to get along in a stale bureaucracy? How many buttocks would he kiss? Did you ever in your life see him toady or fawn? (...) Look into the honest iron and tell me: have you failed your dead family?   The implication, more meaningful in context, is that she does not fit in anywhere -- she's not tough cheap iron, like her parents, but she's not carefully-refined silver, like the white-collar elite she aims to land among. It's a strange kind of cruel praise, because he's telling her to accept herself while pointing out that she will never achieve her dreams and by pursuing them at all has betrayed her parents.  How it applies to Chiyo, I have no idea."
HannibalTV,3dlsv8,ryanplant-au,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:08:14 2015 UTC,"Iron's nucleus is also incredible stable, though Silver's can be pretty reactive. I wonder if he was trying to say she has a steady hand, but lets emotions fuel her at times?"

HannibalTV,3dlsv8,HorrorFancy,12,Fri Jul 17 17:12:16 2015 UTC,I saw it more as Hannibal refusing to let go of his one true love/bromance.
HannibalTV,3dlsv8,Colonel_Angus_,11,Fri Jul 17 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that scene of Will telling him he just can't do this anymore was the closest Hannibal's ever been on the show to crying. He didn't want the friendship ending on those terms, even if it wasn't what Will wanted."
HannibalTV,3dlsv8,SweeneyTom,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:16 2015 UTC,All the more reason to love to hate Hannibal to me. He'd prefer to cut his own friend's head open than to part peacefully.

HannibalTV,3dlsv8,HorrorFancy,3,Fri Jul 17 17:15:22 2015 UTC,"In Hannibal's defense, Will was about to cut his throat in public. They were both going to try to kill each other, even knowing that it would be like killing themselves (metaphorically). They complete each other in a way that transcends anything they've ever known before so it's interesting to see that they've now reached the point where they're relatively past trying to kill each other. Will's going to heavily compensate, Hannibal will certainly become embittered...should make for a good miniseries esque event.  but the question on my mind is ""where the fuck is Bedelia?"""

HannibalTV,3dlsv8,PoesRaven,8,Fri Jul 17 17:24:19 2015 UTC,"I cried like a baby at the breakup scene.  I knew exactly how Will felt, simply exhausted both mentally and physically from all this.  When he said, ""I miss the dogs, but I won't miss you,"" it was a slap in the face.  The opposite of love is not hate, it's apathy.  That I could feel sorry for Hannibal after all he's done is a testament to the show and to these two actors.  I know that Hannibal and Will will always have a strong connection, but I was so happy that Will finally got to this place of strength and clarity in his journey. If the series had ended here, I would feel satisfied, unlike the S1 and S2 finales, which makes me very nervous for the S3 finale."

I know a lot of book/movie fans are disappointed we're not going to get some of the great ""how did you catch me/him?"" quotes, I think ""I miss my dogs. I’m not going to miss you"" makes up for it.   The only part of the episode I wasn't that fussed on was Chiyoh, but I've been pretty meh about her since the beginning. I don't know what the writers were going for with her, but I have no idea what her motives were, and outside of conveniently saving Jack from the corrupt police IDK what she really added to the plot."
HannibalTV,3dlsv8,diddum,2,Sat Jul 18 02:47:02 2015 UTC,I do hope though that if we get a season 4 from someone else or a feature film that it isn't a proper goodbye in terms of their relationship outside of a prison cell. their love/hate thing they have for each other is what has made this show into what it is.
HannibalTV,3dlsv8,ChesapeakeRipper98,2,Fri Jul 17 11:24:59 2015 UTC,That was one of the most fucked up episodes of TV I've seen. It was great.

After thinking about it, I do dig how Hannibal turned himself in. Maybe not just as a means to see Will again eventually, or to spite him, but because his ""game"" isn't over yet. He's still playing, he hasn't surrendered, he's just begun a new level. Perhaps he already knows he's heading for Chilton's hospital, and he's played Chilton before, so he's pretty sure he can do it again.   Here's my question: the pig. How the hell did that work? Did Mason keep a baby that whole time, then stick the baby in the pig? Like, I honestly have no idea how to interpret that part other than, there was a dead baby in the pig and that was really facking disturbing."
HannibalTV,3doarw,bpainsickbrain,4,Sat Jul 18 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"I saw it as, when Mason took Margot's ability to have children, he harvested eggs and impregnated a (well paid) surrogate.

It's a significant development for his character. The way to freedom isn't putting Hannibal in chains, but freeing himself from the mental bond that has connected the two of them. And Hannibal flipped everything around brilliantly by turning himself in so that Will couldn't be free of him, knowing that sooner or later Will would need to seek him out.  I agree when it comes to Chiyoh. She just felt...there. I never cared about her character. I feel like she could have used some more development. If we'd found out why she feels so protective of Hannibal (beyond him just having messed with her head when she was younger), I think she would have been more interesting."

HannibalTV,3do4ni,Walker_Bait05,16,Fri Jul 17 21:41:38 2015 UTC,"Did we see Will delight in mutilating prisoner dude? I mean he did it, but it's not like he was dancing a jig as he did it. We don't even know why he did it in the first place, as far as we know no one's ever going to see Firefly man.    And Will has been torn on his feelings about Hannibal since the back end of S2, so I don't get why his being wishy washy about Hannibal in S3 is such a surprise to people. Hannibal and Will have a very complicated relationship, a relationship that in many ways is coded as an abusive romance. Hannibal is the only one who fully understands Will, and who is not only not repulsed by the dark places Will's mind can go, but actually embraces those dark thoughts and impulses. And who does't like being understood? Who doesn't like the idea of being loved warts and all? And if you did have someone who loved you like that would you find it easy to give them up without a second thought?  Throughout S2 Will was fond of saying ""Hannibal wants to be my friend"", but the reverse is also true, Will wants to be Hannibal's friend. And he's never sure if he's willing to ignore the worst part of Hannibal for that, if he's willing to tolerate in the horrors that Hannibal delights in.   Will finally, decisively, saying no to Hannibal is him breaking the cycle of abuse they had been trapped in. Hannibal saves Will's life, but Will saves his own soul, and I don't think that would have been as satisfying if there hadn't been real danger of Will saying ""fuck it all"" to run away with Hannibal in the first place."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,diddum,6,Sat Jul 18 02:18:27 2015 UTC,"I think this was just another victim of the rushed season, meaning we all know Italy was supposed to be a full season, next season Red Dragon and so on. A lot of things had to be condensed. Last nights episode sure felt like a season finale, an epic one (although I WISH we had gotten to see a small portion of Hannibals rage while killing...something) so the case could be made that more interesting and important character moments and dialogue had to be sacrificed due to time.  Feels the same way when you think of Chiyohs story as well. ""Did you eat her"" ""Yes but I did not kill her"" was such a throw away line I felt THAT should have been a revelation. But they just did not have the time."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,JaxTeller718,10,Fri Jul 17 22:36:19 2015 UTC,"I think the worst part of this rushed first half was that it didn't NEED to be rushed?? They wasted so much time on unimportant scenes that they ended up with no time to develop plot points that were actually important i.e. Alana and Margot's relationship, some kind of actual cohesive character for Chiyo and Bedelia, why Pazzi suddenly turned from a nice honest seeming guy to a money hound, etc.  Instead we got snails and Will whining and changing his mind about how he feels every five seconds."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,stampedes,5,Fri Jul 17 23:42:12 2015 UTC,"I cant argue that. Chiyo could have been just as tragic a figure as Will but we couldnt get a chance to feel that. Bedelia was bouncing back and forth between love and disgust and we never really got a chance to feel her pain as well. By the time Jack was showing up at Hannibals all the pieces were fitting way too conveniently together.   If I could compare two very different shows, The Fugitive from the 60's had a great amount of tension because you never knew when Kimble and the One Armed Man would be in the same room. It made those moments epic. Hannibal and Will came together far too conveniently and quickly for it to feel epic. It was great to watch, but epic not really. My heart wanted to break for Hannibal when Will told him Goodbye, but I realized that I had not been given enough time to WANT to see Will and Hannibal sit together and share a quiet conversation.  If we took the two flashback episodes from thebeginning and condensed them into 1, following up with the Hannibal episode and then an ADDITIONAL Italy episode where charactors and motives could be made more clear and defined it would have gone a long way. The way it is now I think they took great material and burned through it just to race to the Red Dragon story when this show has never been about rushing tension and forcing action for the sake of a quick resolution. The first 2 years were a great character study of everyone involved, while this year felt like it abandoned that ideal.  Dont get me started on Mason Verger though. Up until episode 7 he was just a guy who wanted revenge. I had no real reason to hate him. Not until the pig, and by that revelation it was over. Way too rushed."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,JaxTeller718,2,Sat Jul 18 00:03:30 2015 UTC,"Couldn't have said it better.  Here's hoping that they rushed through these episode so they could really nail Red Dragon, I guess. And hopefully Will may actually resemble who he is in the books..."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,stampedes,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:10:17 2015 UTC,"It's impossible for the Will in Red Dragon to resemble the books at this point. In the book, he didn't have a relationship with Hannibal aside from 1-2 consultations on the CR murders. Here...there's way too much history and depth. Even the approach to Dollarhyde has apparently been changed a bit to how I always assumed they'd use Clarice: as a chess piece to assert dominance over."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,Sempere,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:02:19 2015 UTC,"I get that Will's never gonna be exactly like he is in Red Dragon, but I'd still like something different than the strange will-Clarice-Hannibal hybrid he's been in the first half of the season. He needs to get a solid characterization."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,stampedes,2,Sat Jul 18 12:18:25 2015 UTC,Great argument. I wanted to get into the emotions of this arc but it just didn't work. When Will and Hannibal sat together it felt too soon.
HannibalTV,3do4ni,nina00i,2,Sat Jul 18 04:59:54 2015 UTC,"I remember reading somewhere that they had such a tight shooting schedule that they got very few of the shots they had planned, so little that they actually postponed the season so they could shoot a little bit more.  I get the feeling that even with the extra footage, they still got only a fraction of what they wanted, hence the slow-mo shots and gratuitous flashbacks."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,Nomoreadviceanimals,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:40:11 2015 UTC,"One of the weirdest thing for me is that you can tell from behind the scene stuff that they've cut a LOT of scenes that would explain some things for reasons that I cannot fathom other than Bryan says that they ruined the pace of the episode. Or that Gillian Anderson looked frumpy in one of her outfits, apparently."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,stampedes,2,Sat Jul 18 12:16:52 2015 UTC,"I thought Bedelia had a fantastic arc this season.  I would have liked to see more of it, but what we got was perfectly cohesive and played exceptionally well by Gillian, IMO.  Alana and Margot's relationship was one of mutual convenience; they were both united in their goal to use and get rid of Mason.  I don't think we needed more screentime to understand how it began.  Pazzi always seemed somewhat shady to me.  Getting the money was a way of securing a better life for himself and his wife while offering him a chance to see Hannibal captured once and for all.  It wasn't just about pure greed.  ""Will whining and changing his mind about how he feels""  Were you even paying attention to his arc this season?  There was a nice, logical progression from Will questioning Hannibal and questioning his similarities to Hannibal to ultimately rejecting them.  There was no arbitrary change between scenes."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,Rusted300,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:05:06 2015 UTC,"What was Bedelia's arc? Seriously, tell me. I'm not saying they can't or won't expand on it in upcoming episodes during Red Dragon, but she could basically be replaced by a lamp in the 'find Hannibal' half of this season and it would not make much of a difference to the story. She does very little other than look terrified and then randomly throw shade at Hannibal. The only big thing she does in the whole first half is tell the Italian police where Hannibal is cutting up Will.  As for Alana and Margot, it's ridiculous to say that it was just a relationship of mutual convenience. You can tell in Digestivo that Alana is emotionally invested in the relationship. Hell, she helps Margot MURDER MASON because of what he'd done and him threatening Margot. That's not an act Alana would participate in lightly. So yeah, it would be nice to see at least SOME lead up as to how the two of them got emotionally invested in each other. It's not as if it's just a one night stand. There was a possibility of showing really interesting character interaction while Margot figured out Alana wasn't really on Mason's side, etc etc.   Personally, Pazzi came off fine to me in the show. It wasn't until the episode he died that him worrying about money was introduced at all. It was rushed, man. If I hadn't read the books and known how it would end up, I'd be like 'Whoa I thought this guy only cared about clearing his name but now he's suddenly deep into money??'   and LMAO yeah I was paying attention to Will's arc this season. And it was whiny as shit. I love Will, but damn. He could be a politician for all the flip flopping he does in the first seven episode of this season.   I like this season a lot, but it's real flawed."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,stampedes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:59 2015 UTC,Completely agreed. While I'm happy with the decision because that means we'll get to see Red Dragon on screen (I was fairly sure that season 3 was going to be Hannibal's last even before it aired). But so many of these points are right on the money. The pacing of the first half of this season was definitely off and it could have been better allocated in the first 2-3 eps.
HannibalTV,3do4ni,thegreekie,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:55:51 2015 UTC,"I also a little bummed out that Hannibal just turned himself in... especially after he was so pissed that Will would deny him his freedom in last season's finale. Plus, a huge part of his character is his hatred of being caged."
HannibalTV,3do4ni,thegreekie,7,Fri Jul 17 23:54:27 2015 UTC,Will Rejected him.  If he had gone they would never see each other again.  Will would not have that same desire and urge to find him.  If he is incarcerated it will only be a matter of time before Will returns.
HannibalTV,3do4ni,Kimchidiary,6,Sat Jul 18 08:23:07 2015 UTC,"He was pissed because of Will's betray, not because he was going to be incarcerated. It was perfect that he turned himself in. Hannibal can not help but abuse Will while at the same time he won't let his obsession go, even if it costs him his freedom. He does enjoy his freedom, but it's not important the he hate being caged. It's the reason why he's spent so much time in building his Memory Palace, so he can be free inside his mind. Hannibal isn't so easily broken by anything, not torture nor confinement. And in the end, he did it all on his terms, he had control."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,thebeginningistheend,48,Fri Jul 17 16:37:51 2015 UTC,"This version makes Hannibal a more powerful character.  He once again robs everyone of their satisfaction by being in control.  Will dismisses him and doesn't want to know where he is: too bad, Will.  Jack has been obsessed with capturing the Chesapeake Ripper: the Chesapeake Ripper comes forward and surrenders.  Chiyoh wants him to suffer being caged: Hannibal welcomes being caged.  This Hannibal follow several trains of thought at once, and one of them is that he is always playing with people.  When he is ready to leave his cage, he will."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,RabbitHoleNetwork,5,Fri Jul 17 19:32:17 2015 UTC,"Chiyoh wants him to suffer being caged   Why does she then help him escape Muskrat Farm, where he was suffering in a literal cage?"
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,Riverboat_Gambler,11,Fri Jul 17 22:57:09 2015 UTC,"Chiyoh needed to confront Hannibal and ask about Mischa.  It's possible that she wants him caged on her terms, not on Mason's which is just torture and death, but legitimately with someone else as his keeper.  However, I do find her character frustrating.  She also says, ""Some beasts should not be caged,"" then at the end, she has him in her sights until he is cuffed."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,RabbitHoleNetwork,7,Fri Jul 17 23:23:34 2015 UTC,"I wondered if the line meant herself? She does consider herself stronger and less malleable than Will. As for the ambiguity of who she intended on shooting in that final sequence, tracking Hannibal through the scope is also pretty much the only means of keeping an eye on him regardless if she did/n't intend to shoot him."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,orangewaxlion,2,Sat Jul 18 02:23:51 2015 UTC,"I think it was both a means of keeping him in her sights, to watch him leave, AND her doubting whether or not she should shoot hannibal. Killing him would ensure he'd never be free again and it would follow her previous reasoning, where she said he shouldn't be caged. I think she was contemplating whether or not to deny him a cage."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,Re4pr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:37:07 2015 UTC,"Hannibal is always playing, as the episode reminds us. This is the most interesting move for him at the end. It's also a nice reversal of what one might expect - that Hannibal allow himself to be captured in order to save Will, a necessary and somewhat touching sacrifice. It's still a sacrifice for Will, but it's anything but a rescue (or touching - you could argue it's one of Hannibal's most sadistic moments)."

HannibalTV,3dn2hz,pajamasecrets,3,Fri Jul 17 18:41:23 2015 UTC,"I didn't read that stare as longing. I read it as straight-up smugness. Like, ""You thought you could get away from me. Forget about me. But I am never going to let you forget me or what I have done to you. Nice try."""
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,j-dusk,3,Sun Jul 19 04:16:35 2015 UTC,"I saw it as longing. (The show talks about multiple universes, so there's definitely room for multiple interpretations!) Obviously, it was a little spiteful, this being Hannibal and all, but this whole season has been about how Hannibal and Will can't function unless they're with each other. Being separated was awful for both of them. No matter how much Hannibal may want to hurt Will, he also adores him, and can't imagine a life without Will.   To put it in simpler terms, it's just a super fucked up love-hate relationship."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,pajamasecrets,9,Sun Jul 19 04:28:44 2015 UTC,"No, I wasn't really bothered by it. I feel, in the context of his relationship with Will, that it made great sense emotionally because then Will would always know where to find him. Also, remember in the season 2 finale when they were destroying patient files - the idea of being incarcerated didn't bother him. He stated that if he were ever apprehended he would live in his memory palace, which is when we first hear about the foyer being the Norman Chapel in Palermo."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,d007h8,8,Fri Jul 17 18:42:02 2015 UTC,"It caught me off-guard.  Another was why the police came at night instead of right after when Hannibal leaves  (Will could have said ""they know"" -- queue Hannibal walking outside to police lights).  I think Fuller continued with Hannibal as the Devil.  The Devil never leaves you, he is going to stay close and continue to persuade and torment.  As far as the police coming at night, it gave some breathing room that Hannibal might have actually fled, and Hannibal surrendering kept the slower tempo the episode went into after the Mason Verger animal farm.  Surrendering also lives up to what Fuller as set in that Hannibal is 'always in control'.  There are differences from the books, I don't think that Lector would have surrendered for sure.  I am excited to see Hannibal behind bars for the second half of the season -- all back to the mind-games!"
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,HorrorFancy,9,Fri Jul 17 17:05:57 2015 UTC,"Our version of Hannibal is more bound by his desire to manipulate events and people than any desire for conventional freedom; if he thinks he's going to be chased forever, but not by Will, and this doesn't satisfy his need for the right quality of attention, it feels quite natural for him to stroll into 'captivity', and take a sabbatical from freedom at a designated point in time in a way that affords nobody else any satisfaction, and fucks with more than a couple of them (Alana and Margot aren't going to be comfortable with him being on hand for questions about the Verger house & occupants).  Given his supreme confidence his own ability to think rings around everyone else, he's a) not going to get bored manipulating people from inside, and b) if he wants out, then a master manipulator of events needs a good challenge every now and then.  He literally just talked himself out of one cage and Will's already told us that 'Hannibal doesn't worry'.  Hopkin's Lecter frothed to get out because it wasn't his choice to get in.  Not a different character, just a different circumstance."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,city17_dweller,5,Fri Jul 17 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"I was a little bothered by him surrendering himself for much the same reasons you're quoting. Except....   ... He's arrogant. I'd liken it to X-Men First Class, where the authorative and wise Charles Xavier is shown to us as a brash young man and resembles very little what he will become. We're getting a Lecter akin to this, in a much smaller way, I think. We are in prequel territory still don't forget and to my mind Lecter is willing to give himself up to taunt Will because his arrogance allows him to believe that escape will be little or no obstacle to him should he wish to do so. He also has Chiyo, does she exist or someone like her in the novels? Cause I'd be confident of her assistance in a prison break. That's my take on things anyway, based on being a fan of the show and movies alone."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,MadNially88,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:44:59 2015 UTC,"He's arrogant, but is he really that naive?"

HannibalTV,3dn2hz,bhammer100,3,Fri Jul 17 19:14:19 2015 UTC,No. It doesn't bother me. Just because he turns himself in now doesn't mean he isn't going regret the decision later on.
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,JackieBoySlim,4,Fri Jul 17 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"This makes perfect sense for Hannibal's character. For one, you say that he longs to be free, but in the passage that you quoted, ""He was free in his head."" So clearly he feels in some way mentally that he is free even under incarceration. Even in the books, he keeps himself amused. It's the reason why he builds his Memory Palace in the first place. Second, Hannibal is like the most abusive boyfriend, he's constantly mentally torturing Will. Turning himself in so that Will always know where he is, is the perfect move for Hannibal, it makes so much sense. It falls right in line with everything that we know about him: that he can not stop obsessing over Will, that he has an extremely strong will that torture or discomfort can not shake, and that he's always in control. No one has been able to truly take that form him, and his actions in this episode were the result of absolutely brilliant writing."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,skullapius,3,Sat Jul 18 04:23:01 2015 UTC,"It didn't bothered me at all. I was surprised by it, as a good TV show should do, but not bothered.  This season showed us a self-destructive side of Hannibal. First, he clearly said he founded peace in Vienna. So why the impulsive killing and why letting alive a potential dangerous witness? Just because he was insulted by him?  He also let a sadist multimillionaire alive that would so obviously seek revenge.   And there is also pride. A man's pride will be the cause of his fall. It is my opinion that Hannibal dislike using other's people names and that is beneath him to be a runaway.   There is a difference between a free animal and a hunted animal."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,grafton24,2,Sat Jul 18 01:27:57 2015 UTC,"Hannibal is arrogant to believe he can escape when he's done with Will.  Also, sacrifice himself for another 'love' (Clarice) so this is not beyond the pale."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,sassyspeechie,2,Fri Jul 17 17:29:30 2015 UTC,"I found it to be very telling of the extent of not only Hannibal's manipulation of the situation, but also of the intensity of his relationship with Will. When he says to Jack (paraphrasing here) that he'll always know where the Chesapeake Ripper is and then glances at Will after he had JUST told him that he never wants to see/hear of him again, I figured it was a form of revenge, but also an unwillingness to part from his only friend."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,akuma_river,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:01:57 2015 UTC,When Will was in his bed and talking with Hannibal and giving them 'I don't care anymore about you' apathetic speech of a true break up I swear I could hear the melody to 'Somebody I Used to Know' playing.  This was Will saying he's done. He done with Hannibal in all forms.  Hannibal surrendering and then that speech about 'always knowing where he is' was him telling Will 'you might be done with me but I'm not with you. I'll make you care again.' Hence: The Red Dragon arc where both Will and Hannibal are trying to 'save' Francis.
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,Walker_Bait05,2,Sat Jul 18 01:37:35 2015 UTC,I feel like hannibal giving himself up shows us how he's really in control of the situation no matter if he's incarcerated or not. He still has the upper hand. No one could catch him but himself.

It just so happens that it doesn't fit the character as he's defined in the books.    Boo frickin' hoo. The show's veered off pretty wildly multiple times from the source material and from day one, they've never pretended that this wasn't going to be a different take. A different take with similarities but a different take nonetheless.  If and only if an adaptation advertises itself as an honest retelling or pretends to be accurate and then contradicts that notion, then you have a leg to stand on.  If One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest was a bird watching documentary, it would simply be a bird watching documentary called One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest, with no relation to the movie, other than the shared title. Unless it was ambigiously marketed to leech off the movie's established place in history, I don't see what the problem would be.  tl;dr I'll drink the ""kook-aid"", you carry on drinking the mook-aid and acting like a pencil-neck geek."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,Re4pr,-1,Sat Jul 18 10:19:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, in the next few episodes you're going to see Bryan Fuller completely 180 on this questionable creative decision.   Hannibal in Red Dragon is defined by his impotent fury at his imprisonment. It impinges on everything he says and does and drives a lot of of the action at the ending stages of the book.   In a few weeks people are going to be asking ""Why does Hannibal blame Will so much for being locked up."" And the response people will have will be ""Well, it was like that way in the books.""   But no, I'm a ""pencil-necked geek"", you fucking trash-talking uncivil ass."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,j-dusk,3,Sat Jul 18 10:27:24 2015 UTC,"I mean... you do realize that the extent of Will's interactions with Hannibal in Red Dragon before he consults with him on Dolarhyde was finding Hannibal through grunt work, having a lucky epiphany, and getting gutted by a linoleum knife? The Will/Hannibal scenes are going to have to be different by definition because they have a long and sordid history that didn't exist before this adaptation. The scenes from Red Dragon between the two of them have already been played out in large part via Gideon in earlier episodes."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,Riverboat_Gambler,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:32:47 2015 UTC,"I felt that too. But getting arrested would have been an insult to the character the show has built up. Why would he ever get arrested if he doesn't abide by any of the threats the police throws his way? If he keeps fighting till he dies. Surrender sort of gives him the upper hand over things. He wants to stay close to Will Graham and take his revenge(?) or do whatever he intends to do.  Secondly, I feel Chiyoh had a great role to play in Hannibal's arrest. The scene where they showed her sniper on hannibal felt like she forced him to surrender(?)  Bryan! We need your explanation!"
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,divingstation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:33:29 2015 UTC,"I can definitely see the contradiction, but I think you need to come to terms with the fact that Fuller is driving the characters in his own directions.  The hannibal we see portrayed in the series is already vastly different from what we saw in the movies and what I assume he is portrayed as in the books. I haven't read them, but judging from this portion of text and other parts I've seen, the movies are very close to the books, at least in the portrayal of hannibal.  Hannibal in the series is different, he's calm, less stereotypically evil too. Which is a good thing I think, since I have actually empathized with hannibal on more than one occasion in the series, felt sorry for him. That's a very powerful and odd thing that the series has managed, in the movies, and from what I guess in the books, he's pure evil and is easy to despise.  He's not the same batman or superman. It's a reinvented character."
HannibalTV,3dn2hz,Noye,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"I disagree. The Hannibal we see doesn't value freedom above all else, but rather power. He risked being found out in the first season because he was too tempted by/curious about Will's mind and saw the potential to manipulate him to a rewarding end. When Bedelia told him he was going to get caught, he resigned himself to it, and drew everyone even closer to him so he could exert control instead of running far away.  If he had left this episode, for good, he would have left knowing that Will was over him. Will would go back to an ordinary life not caring about Hannibal, not missing Hannibal. Meanwhile, the influence Will had on his life was profound and once-in-a-lifetime, and I sincerely doubt Hannibal would have been able to forget about him or stop missing him - no one would be able to understand him like Will did. If Hannibal had just left and cut ties, he would have lost.  He could have kidnapped Will, probably. A bit of a pain to deal with hen on the run, though. But using force would reinforce Will's desire to leave him. Prison is the place where he will retain the most influence and likelihood of drawing Will back to him."
HannibalTV,3dlnap,MohamedEV,6,Fri Jul 17 07:19:37 2015 UTC,You can use a VPN to watch it.  And I'd like to point out that you can find torrents and other download links if you search for them in case you don't like streaming.
HannibalTV,3dlnap,Sacathus,0,Fri Jul 17 07:21:41 2015 UTC,Stupid question why would someone prefer to torrent it when you easily find a stream/vod of it? Seems like there's a bigger risk to torrent a show rather then stream it for free off a site

HannibalTV,3dlqbl,nina00i,4,Fri Jul 17 08:04:08 2015 UTC,I'm confused about who's baby it is - Will's and Margot's that was saved during her hysterectomy or a Mason and Margot one?
HannibalTV,3dlqbl,sherlock2040,3,Fri Jul 17 10:51:00 2015 UTC,I assumed Mason harvested Margot's eggs and used his own sperm to fertilise and a pig uterus was used as surrogate. Too much time has passed for it to have been original baby...plus I think that would have been too early to do that with.
HannibalTV,3dlqbl,akuma_river,2,Fri Jul 17 17:55:09 2015 UTC,Not really.  It's been about 9 months since the end of Mizumoto. And the hysterectomy was about a few weeks before that?  So it is possible that it was Will and Margot's. But Mason is too much of a bastard and he would use his own sperm.  The question is...how did the baby grow if it's fetal heart never beat? Or...did it once beat but then it died and Mason decided to flaunt it in Margot's face?
HannibalTV,3dlqbl,StevenRayOrr,2,Sat Jul 18 02:02:42 2015 UTC,I assumed Mason harvested Margot's eggs and used his own sperm to fertilise and a pig uterus was used as surrogate.   I'm quoting in case you missed just how disturbing a sentence that was. Every part of that sentence makes me uncomfortable.
HannibalTV,3dlqbl,sherlock2040,3,Sat Jul 18 02:24:40 2015 UTC,In my defence we are talking about a show were a guy was sowed into a horse & a girl was sowed into a horse with a starling sowed into her... :P

HannibalTV,3dlqbl,divingstation,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:46:45 2015 UTC,"I guessed that Mason paid someone to surrogate Margot's eggs and his sperm, then the baby either died or was born dead and mason brought it back to the farm and implanted it in the pig."
HannibalTV,3dlqbl,anotheronedown,5,Sat Jul 18 02:01:09 2015 UTC,That fucking pig...
HannibalTV,3dlqbl,zKENPACHI_bleachHERO,2,Fri Jul 17 09:55:15 2015 UTC,I still can't believe this is aired on network TV. A scene where a man gets his face sliced off while 2 women cut a dead human fetus out of a pig is probably more horrifying than anything I've ever seen in a movie. I'm not complaining by any stretch of the imagination I'm more in awe and how they were able to show it. That being said I think this was the most satisfying episode of television I've watched since the end of breaking bad.
HannibalTV,3dlqbl,Askmeifiseethings,8,Sat Jul 18 06:26:45 2015 UTC,The thing that stood out the most was the creepy weird beautifully scary friendship between will and Hannibal and how they just cannot go without each other.

HannibalTV,3dlqbl,d007h8,5,Sat Jul 18 05:17:27 2015 UTC,Honestly I thought nothing in the show could top Mizumonos final 15 minutes but the final goodbye/break up between Will and Hannibal was heartbreaking. I know were getting Red Dragon but the whole basis of the show so far has been about their Relationship and how they have affected each other lives. It will be interesting to see whether Will will slip back into that train of thought of if hes now permanently  blocked his mind from Hannibal
HannibalTV,3dlqbl,Bmart008,7,Fri Jul 17 11:29:22 2015 UTC,"It DID feel heartbreaking, esp when Hannibal got up to leave without saying anything.

HannibalTV,3dlqbl,slmiami,3,Sat Jul 18 01:57:49 2015 UTC,"Can I just say how amusingly absurdit was the number of book and movie references, particularly to Silence? The face 'gag'(heh) and Mason's 'childbearing hips...roomy' line made me laugh harder than I really should have this episode. Throw in Hannibal trying to eat Will's brain which we revisited this episode, and it was Thomas Harris hog heaven.  Edit-a bit more abstract but Bedelia taking the heroin/meds and not knowing who she was was very reminiscent of what Hannbal did to Clarice in Hannbal as well. They really cherry pick their references well and put them in sideways. Love it."

That said, I hope Gillian Anderson and Laurence Fishburne get nominated for Supporting Actress/Actor. And I think it's about damn time that Brian Reitzell gets a nod for his music score contribution!"
HannibalTV,3diw6i,frigidandhappy,4,Thu Jul 16 18:19:48 2015 UTC,I hope Mads Mikkelsen and Hugh Dancy get nominated for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series.  And definitely Bryan Fuller for Outstanding Drama Series.
HannibalTV,3diw6i,frigidandhappy,3,Thu Jul 16 18:21:32 2015 UTC,Yes of course! Mads especially. He really brought a whole new light on Hannibal in ways that the films could not have done. And Bryan Fuller and DeLaurentiis & Co for troopering on for three years despite the lack of good ratings.
HannibalTV,3diw6i,daedalus311,6,Thu Jul 16 18:31:33 2015 UTC,"To be honest, when Season 1 first aired, I was already rooting for Mads to get an Emmy nomination later that year. His performance as Hannibal Lecter was refreshing and definitely his own, especially when Anthony Hopkins won an Oscar for that performance in 1992 (movie was released on February 1991, so it was eligible for the Oscars the following year).  Mads' performance alone reinvigorated the Hannibal mythos, which was lost after three disappointing movies (Hannibal, Red Dragon, and Hannibal Rising). I'll even admit, on the record, that when I first heard that the DeLaurentiis Company was not only doing a prequel, but they were going to reboot the entire story line, I was livid and shot the series down immediately.  So when the premiere came, I watched it to see how bad the pilot would be. I tried so hard to hate it...but it didn't work. As Season 1 continued to air, I fell in love with Mads' interpretation of Hannibal and how each episode was breathtakingly shot and expertly well written.  I was pissed when Mads was snubbed for Season 1 and 2 and that the show didn't get a nomination for Outstanding Drama Series."
HannibalTV,3diw6i,khanarx,-1,Thu Jul 16 18:59:53 2015 UTC,"I domt know where else to post this. The circlejerk for this show on this subreddit astounds me   its a great show.  And not very popular.  Nominations are popularity contests.  The name hannibal alone kills tons of potential viewership. The show will never be BB in popularity or cult following.  Enjoy, tell folks about it, but always know this show, and societys view of it, will not amount to your expectations  of its popularity.   In other words, get off hannibals nuts.  Its rather embarassing to continuously read about OH NO ITS THE GREATEST SHOW EVER WHY DOES NO ONE CARE ABOUT MY DEAR HANNIBAL AND WILL. preaching to the choir here, rather annoying, dig?   i expect downvotes but my point is valid and relevant."

Sadly it's one of many.  Though every bit of positivity helps, this doesn't take away from Hannibal being a critical darling... yet regular people still won't tune in.  NBC banishing the show to the televised weekend wastelands makes it that much tougher for potential new viewers (and even us regular fans)."

HannibalTV,3diuor,jeserodriguez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:53:46 2015 UTC,The only season thing he changed is that we don't get Hannibal on the run again this time with Clarice bit.   Basically the plan was:   Season 1 - The Bromance of Hannibal and Will Season 2 - The Break Up Season 3 - Hannibal and Bedelia on the run leading up to & including Red Dragon Season 4 - Exploration of Hannibal and Will's relationship leading up to Silence of the Lambs Season 5 - Silence of the Lambs Season 6 - Hannibal  Season 7 - Original ending   Since season 3 and 6 would have the same themes (Hannibal on the run with a captive) Bryan decided to change things up and include Hannibal and Hannibal Rising bits in season 3.  So basically the new plan (before being cancelled) was:   Season 3 - Hannibal (with bits of Hannibal Rising) + Red Dragon Season 4 - Exploration of Hannibal & Will's relationship that betrays season 3 finale? And sets up season 5. Season 5 - Silence of the Lambs Season 6 - Original ending

Maybe because Hannibal was angry that Will wanted to kill him after saying he had forgiven him, he would get back at Will for lying.   Then when Alana asked him to save Will he seemed all for it. Hannibal to the rescue! Like he's now got it in his head that Will can be turned back to the Dark Side again. Hannibal is also a smartass with an ego the size of Jupiter and gets off on toying with people - besides Will I suspect that's what he loves the most. He tried one last time at the end to ask Will if they could be best buddies. When he was rejected and told to fuck off, Hannibal took off his I Love Will pants and put his smartass pants on, and quickly figured out a way to safely stay in Will's life forever."

HannibalTV,3dm1nl,d007h8,2,Sun Jul 19 04:25:13 2015 UTC,"I assumed it was because of Will breaking up with him.  Will told him that he doesn't want to see him, hear from him or think about him and to the only person that Hannibal feels truly understands him that's got to be pretty upsetting. He's staying close so that Will can't just forget about him, they share rooms in the memory palace after all."
HannibalTV,3dll2y,divingstation,7,Fri Jul 17 06:51:24 2015 UTC,i always figured that Molly left Will because of everything that happened anyways and that's how Will completely slipped into the alcoholism
HannibalTV,3dll2y,NightmareStagFTW,4,Fri Jul 17 07:34:57 2015 UTC,"It seemed reallllllly heavily implied that Will and Molly were pretty much done, even before the whole face thing."

HannibalTV,3dll2y,stampedes,2,Fri Jul 17 08:37:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, same.  If anyone can pull it off, it'd be Fuller, but it just seems so cliche. Not to mention kind of a ripoff of that Dexter season finale."
HannibalTV,3dll2y,RabbitHoleNetwork,2,Fri Jul 17 09:01:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I expect Molly to leave him because Will can never be happy or well-adjusted, but if they introduce her to just kill her off to punish Will, that would be terrible.  OTOH, Hannibal always wins in the end.  Will is allowed his minor victories, but Hannibal is the one who leaves destruction in his wake."
HannibalTV,3dll2y,Lecter07,2,Fri Jul 17 20:29:53 2015 UTC,"I would be really annoyed, after that. I want Will to be Will, again, and he can't be as long as he's addicted to Lecter. They aren't friends, and it doesn't make sense that they would be. Hannibal Lecter is a manipulative monster, and I need Will to understand that by the end of the Season, or it's like he didn't learn anything. Just my opinion."
HannibalTV,3dll2y,NightmareStagFTW,3,Fri Jul 17 12:20:40 2015 UTC,"Will is already broken beyond repair, he was heavily cracked to begin with but after all of that he's never going to be the Will that he once was ever again"

HannibalTV,3dn4ft,molbiman,7,Fri Jul 17 16:52:51 2015 UTC,"You're not alone. This season seems to have divided fans of the show. People either like it or they don't. Me, personally, i like the artsy stuff. There is a lot of content this season but it is more directed at the characters."
HannibalTV,3dn4ft,bhammer100,2,Fri Jul 17 18:34:31 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. Personally I think it's the best season of television that's ever been produced. I can see, though, how it might not be everybody's cup of tea. Shattering. In slow motion. Again."
HannibalTV,3dn4ft,schleppylundo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:02:54 2015 UTC,"And then appearing with Will Graham's face as the tea cup, also shattering."
HannibalTV,3dn4ft,LikelyWhisper99,5,Sat Jul 18 04:55:38 2015 UTC,"Well I dealt with the artsy stuff in the first two seasons just fine, but its changed a lot in this season. A face fading into a different face is nowhere near as cool to watch as some of the stuff they did in prior seasons. As for dialogue, it was certainly slow-paced in the first couple episodes, but it seems to have picked up just fine, if with obvious abruptness."
HannibalTV,3dn4ft,Mccmangus,4,Fri Jul 17 19:00:20 2015 UTC,"I think the extreme artfulness will be contained to the Hannibal's European arc.  We are in Hannibal's world and seeing it from his perspective, as well as the perspective of those he changed the most, and Will was already our conduit into the more surreal aspects of the show.  I expect the show to return to the feel of the previous seasons once we are back in the U.S. and Hannibal is in custody.  I'm curious to see what, if anything, will be different now that we'll be exploring Francis Dolarhyde and his psychology."
HannibalTV,3dn4ft,RabbitHoleNetwork,2,Fri Jul 17 20:02:33 2015 UTC,I believe the Europe scenes are intentionally full of artsy stuff but the episode set back in US wasn't.
HannibalTV,3dn4ft,annasinn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:40:23 2015 UTC,I was with you until episodes 5 and 6. The tension ratcheted up and it seems to be getting back on track. I'm hopeful that we'll get back to the feel of the first two seasons.
HannibalTV,3dn4ft,evilbeandog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:45:12 2015 UTC,"Only the first few episodes were like that, it's not anymore. I do agree those episodes could've been better (for other reasons, not 'cause it was too artsy') but I can't believe people really thought the whole season would be like that. Anyway, hopefully people will catch up with the show and stop complaining about this. (Don't mean to be rude, OP, it's just that so many people keep complaining about this even though it's not even an issue anymore if you're fully caught up with the show)"
HannibalTV,3dn4ft,invisiblestone,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:05:32 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, but I'm trying to appreciate it more by thinking of it like Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, which was slow moving in the rising action, but was absolutely beautiful. But the end of the movie had a great, albeit confusing, payoff and I'm sure this season will too."
HannibalTV,3dk0kg,ambidextrouspro,8,Thu Jul 16 22:03:01 2015 UTC,Try subtitles. They let me keep the volume down so I can watch the show no problem when people are sleeping in the next room over.

HannibalTV,3dip9l,DonatedPizza,14,Thu Jul 16 16:18:12 2015 UTC,"It's implied that he is on the autism spectrum and/or has an empathy disorder. Basically he has a difficult-to-control ability to identify with others' emotions and assume their point of view, even to the point that it can become disturbing and possibly start to overwhelm his own identity."
HannibalTV,3dip9l,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,5,Thu Jul 16 16:23:20 2015 UTC,"There is also an additional thing effecting Will, which shouldn't be spoiled, and will be explained, /u/DonatedPizza."

HannibalTV,3dip9l,thebeginningistheend,4,Thu Jul 16 23:00:56 2015 UTC,"To be more specific, because of his empathy disorder, detailed knowledge of crime scene investigation, and possibly some sort of autistic savant type deal, he's extremely good at putting himself in the shoes of the killer when he examines a crime scene. Him running through what happened in his head from the killer's perspective is often represented in the show by showing the murder with him as the killer, and him saying ""this is my design"" all the time.  I felt like it might be good to clarify this because I've seen the occasional post on here where people seem to be under the impression that he has some kind of actually magical power instead."
HannibalTV,3dip9l,sempersapiens,2,Thu Jul 16 20:13:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the show does sometimes portray it that way... not explicitly, perhaps, but the show has a sort of ""magical realism"" about it, in the sense that while there are no demonstrably supernatural forces at work, it can sometimes be damn tricky to justify certain things that happen in rational terms alone. I'm thinking mostly of things like the crow emerging from a dead woman's chest last year (yes, I know, a VERY minor spoiler, shoot me), but I also think there are things Will sees in his ""visions"" that are tough to justify purely in terms of imagination, hyper-empathy, and advanced forensic knowledge."
HannibalTV,3dip9l,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,4,Fri Jul 17 00:24:32 2015 UTC,"I believe there was an interview back in season one with either Bryan or Hugh that stated explicitly Will was not on the spectrum, but that he manifests the symptoms deliberately as a coping mechanism."
HannibalTV,3dip9l,dictionary00,3,Fri Jul 17 07:39:11 2015 UTC,"I'll take actual spoken dialogue on the show (and in the scene where they're first establishing Will as a character for us, no less) over Fuller's largely substance-less verbal masturbations."
HannibalTV,3dip9l,Low_Man_n_Yella_Coat,2,Fri Jul 17 07:41:45 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I do feel uncomfortable using real autism yardsticks to evaluate and interpret a character in such a stylized, unrealistic atmosphere."

He could have easily hid forever in Europe, but he enjoyed the game of 'drawing them to him'.  When he is finally 'caught', it will be a decision he makes, not anyone else.  Now, if someone can influence him to choose to be captured, that's another story, but he sure as hell wont be captured out of the blue and be dragged away in surprised rage.

But, I have read (most) of the books (almost done), and they just re-enforced Mads's god-complex in terms of how Lector thinks in his head.  Overall, I'd say the season was building to his capture, and I knew the second he survived Jack a few eps ago that he would be taken by his own plans and not random chance, but how he did it I daresay was a masterstroke of writing on Fuller's part."

HannibalTV,3dh4od,IndigentRagnarok,6,Thu Jul 16 05:55:17 2015 UTC,We don't need a book. We got Thomas Harris for that. A comic book on the other hand...  Probably a movie.
HannibalTV,3dh4od,bhammer100,3,Thu Jul 16 11:46:45 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would like a movie and a S4 comic book series (ala Buffy)."
HannibalTV,3dh4od,ApproBAT,11,Thu Jul 16 18:39:52 2015 UTC,A movie! He already said they're considering a feature at Comic-Con so I'm hoping they go down that route. What makes you want a book from Bryan? Thomas Harris' books are already meant to be great; what would you prefer about Bryan's adaptation? He's not an author so there isn't much hope of that.
HannibalTV,3dh4od,DaedricDave,5,Thu Jul 16 07:15:01 2015 UTC,Personally I'd hate the movie idea. You can't fit the story to be told into a movie and still have it maintain the quality this show has had or the content and way the story has been told. I say hold out for a return to the series or nothing at all.
HannibalTV,3dh4od,Mottso,5,Thu Jul 16 17:26:14 2015 UTC,"Neither really. If a movie made sooner precludes the chance of the show being revived later, after Amazon's streaming deal ends, then I'd rather wait a few years for the show to come back.    A book would be different, but I'd miss the wonderful visual elements and the acting, which I feel is just as integral to Fuller's version of the story as the writing."
HannibalTV,3dh4od,nina00i,2,Thu Jul 16 10:31:45 2015 UTC,"If we had to pick something other than the show, I'd go with comic book. The idea of a movie seems very out of place for this kind of show IMO, but a comic book would allow for all kinds of artistic freedoms and beautifully drawn pictures."
HannibalTV,3dh4od,eifos,2,Thu Jul 16 11:27:51 2015 UTC,Agreed.  A comic book series would give room and time to actually tell the whole story.

HannibalTV,3dfwuv,Erinescence,8,Wed Jul 15 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"its broadcast TV... the more i think about it truly, it doesn't make sense to have Hannibal on broadcast right before the local news.

HannibalTV,3dfwuv,Erinescence,3,Thu Jul 16 00:08:51 2015 UTC,So I can still watch it Friday in the a.m. because it aired in canada? So in the us it's go screw yourself watch it online or wait we don't care.
HannibalTV,3dfwuv,commandantKenny,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:07:19 2015 UTC,luckily no one has done so yet so no worries on ratings.

HannibalTV,3dgbvs,dazed118,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:57:23 2015 UTC,"I think Hannibal see's himself as created in God's image. As in that he is (tries) to be all knowing and is (tries) to be omnipotent.   He sees God's acts as cruel and above all trying, he acts out acts of cruelty and acts of trying and tries to elevate people to act as Gods in their world.   Look here and see similarities  And of course  Leviticus 1  1 The Lord called to Moses and spoke to him from the tent of meeting. He said, 2 “Speak to the Israelites and say to them: ‘When anyone among you brings an offering to the Lord, bring as your offering an animal from either the herd or the flock.  3 “‘If the offering is a burnt offering from the herd, you are to offer a male without defect. You must present it at the entrance to the tent of meeting so that it will be acceptable to the Lord. 4 You are to lay your hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it will be accepted on your behalf to make atonement for you. 5 You are to slaughter the young bull before the Lord, and then Aaron’s sons the priests shall bring the blood and splash it against the sides of the altar at the entrance to the tent of meeting. 6 You are to skin the burnt offering and cut it into pieces. 7 The sons of Aaron the priest are to put fire on the altar and arrange wood on the fire. 8 Then Aaron’s sons the priests shall arrange the pieces, including the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar. 9 You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest is to burn all of it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.  10 “‘If the offering is a burnt offering from the flock, from either the sheep or the goats, you are to offer a male without defect. 11 You are to slaughter it at the north side of the altar before the Lord, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall splash its blood against the sides of the altar. 12 You are to cut it into pieces, and the priest shall arrange them, including the head and the fat, on the wood that is burning on the altar. 13 You are to wash the internal organs and the legs with water, and the priest is to bring all of them and burn them on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord.  14 “‘If the offering to the Lord is a burnt offering of birds, you are to offer a dove or a young pigeon. 15 The priest shall bring it to the altar, wring off the head and burn it on the altar; its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar. 16 He is to remove the crop and the feathers[a] and throw them down east of the altar where the ashes are. 17 He shall tear it open by the wings, not dividing it completely, and then the priest shall burn it on the wood that is burning on the altar. It is a burnt offering, a food offering, an aroma pleasing to the Lord"
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,devshan95,36,Wed Jul 15 06:45:51 2015 UTC,Margot is a lesbian (she simply used Will for his sperm back in Season 2). Alana is apparently bisexual.
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,d007h8,11,Wed Jul 15 10:31:32 2015 UTC,"I figured since she was so blindsided by Hannibal she has difficulties being with another man (think flashbacks, ptsd,...) which is why she searched for relief with Margo who was most likely actively pursuing her. Margo has a history of sleeping with people in order to gain information/ emotional dependence and at this point Alana doesn't care about rules of society or etiquette. Not to mention that I'd also tap that ass if I were Alana."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,CashRockThunderBeast,9,Wed Jul 15 14:04:28 2015 UTC,"Eh, that's not really how sexuality happens. Unless Alana sees this purely as a power play she was already attracted to women whether she acknowledged it or not."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,schleppylundo,-6,Thu Jul 16 07:10:13 2015 UTC,And of course you're an expert on the matter.

HannibalTV,3dcrv3,thebeginningistheend,3,Thu Jul 16 23:02:50 2015 UTC,I noticed in the previous scene that she started dressing differently almost similar to Margot
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,whiskeyandtravel,23,Thu Jul 16 06:59:31 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't surprise me if Alana is getting close to Margot and Mason in a sting in order to arrest Hannibal.  Get Mason to bring them in, and then arrest everymotherfuckingbody."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,DuckingShot,8,Wed Jul 15 13:44:52 2015 UTC,That would be EXCELLENT. And it would definitely go towards what was said about her character sort of becoming more of a force this season where in season 2 she was more of the prey/victim.
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,loudbears,2,Wed Jul 15 13:50:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think Alana has the power to arrest anyone.  She's not FBI, she's a consultant like Will & Hannibal."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,ApproBAT,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:38:33 2015 UTC,"Alana mentioned that she intends to call the FBI once they get Hannibal.  I'm excited to see exactly what happens, but I would bet that she is the one who actually gets Hannibal arrested."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,Tuneatic,0,Thu Jul 16 21:36:45 2015 UTC,Maybe she's wearing a wire or something?
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,DuckingShot,3,Wed Jul 15 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"All she needs to do is phone the FBI and say ""Hannibal Lecter, Verger Mansion, Now!""."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,niceandy,4,Thu Jul 16 01:27:46 2015 UTC,Didn't she mention to Margot that her plan is basically that? A FBI raid on Muskrat Farms in which Mason goes down for kidnapping and torture and Hannibal ends up in Chilton's care?
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,akuma_river,14,Thu Jul 16 04:50:32 2015 UTC,It's pretty clear the direction this relationship is going it wasn't shocking at all that Alana and Margot slept together.  Margot's reproductive organs were removed last season and that was the only way for her to get from underneath her brother's thumb. She can't inherit the family fortune unless she produces an heir. Enter Alana who as far as we know is completely capable of having children. Margot hooksup with Alana in hopes of using her brother's sperm to impregnante her. The sleeping together is an added bonus Margot has always been a lesbian and Alana can you really blame her for wanting to take a break from men?
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,Peanutbutta33,3,Wed Jul 15 12:48:01 2015 UTC,"Enter Alana who as far as we know is completely capable of having children.   After the damage done to her pelvis in the fall I don't think any doctor would recommend it though. That is the one problem I have with it if that's the direction it's going, which I think it is too."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,FatPinkMast,2,Thu Jul 16 01:47:53 2015 UTC,"I interpret it a little differently. I think they are working together, Mason gets the sperm, everyone get's Hannibal, and Alana gets close enough to Mason where she can get evidence and submit it to the FBI or manipulate Mason into making a mistake in the presence of either FBI agents or Hannibal.  I don't think Alana is meant to be a surrogate for Margot"
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,Contramundi324,4,Thu Jul 16 02:54:03 2015 UTC,In the books and movies it was Margot's girlfriend who gets pregnant by Mason.   And here Alana is basically Margot's gf.
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,akuma_river,0,Thu Jul 16 04:51:59 2015 UTC,Yea I don't think a body-building girlfriend would resonate as well with audiences like Dr. Bloom.
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,Peanutbutta33,2,Thu Jul 16 11:19:20 2015 UTC,Wasn't Margot the body-builder?
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,akuma_river,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:21:22 2015 UTC,Shit yea you're right it's been a long-time since I read Hannibal.
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,Peanutbutta33,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"She did it because she wanted to bulk up and be undesirable to Mason, right? Not to mention how lesbians were featured back then in literature and movies, right? Which is why Bryan changed it if I recall because he thought it was bit misogynistic."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,akuma_river,13,Fri Jul 17 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it wasn't also symbolic, with their kaleidoscopic sex scene sort of fusing and blending them into one, while Will and Hannibal spoke of how fused they, themselves were with each other at that point.   In S2, Hannibal and Alana, and Will and Margot were intimate at the same time, and that entire scene became a fusion of their intimacy. I had sort of taken it as intimacy between Will and Hannibal by proxy, the two women they had slept with now laying with each other. I think Fuller relies so heavily on symbolism (especially this season) that nebulous themes should always be taken into consideration when trying to justify some of the plot points."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,razurite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:38:30 2015 UTC,"I was listening to the Eat the Rudecast podcast today and they mentioned something similar to what you are saying.  That the way the scenes of Will and Hannibal and Alana and Margot are shot and the similarity of words and visuals of the 'conjoined' idea is showing how Alana and Margot are now together.   They are working together for their own plans of revenge against both Hannibal (put him in jail) and Mason (Margot's going to kill him) by using Mason and letting him think he's leading them on his revenge quest. Through that process of these months they have recognized something in theirselves in each other.   That moment when Alana and Margot helping to the dress each other shows familiarity and care for each other. This isn't a one night stand but a long-term relationship they have built together.  Similar to how Will and Hannibal built a type of relationship out of their desire to work together for their own goals.  But like Hannibal (and Will in s2), Margot is planning on betraying Alana because she wants Mason dead and not in jail. While Alana wants him in prison. I wonder if Alana will recognize Margot's hands in Mason's death if they decide to follow the book and movie storyline."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,akuma_river,12,Thu Jul 16 04:48:41 2015 UTC,"Margot is a lesbian.   Alana is apparently bisexual, but it is possible that she is manipulating Margot."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,Wolfir,5,Wed Jul 15 18:48:01 2015 UTC,I feel like one of them is manipulating the other as part of some larger plan.
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,rule2productions,37,Wed Jul 15 11:27:23 2015 UTC,"sometimes when 2 adults like each other, they kiss and hug and lie in bed together. that is called ""making love"". it's a very intimate and beautiful thing but it can also be dangerous. you will understand when you grow up. For now, if a stranger ever asks you to do that with him, run away and call the police. and don't ever accept their candy"
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,mokoko__,12,Wed Jul 15 09:17:34 2015 UTC,"I know it's a joke, but this seems way too dismissive for a legitimate question. It wasn't the craziest thing ever, but that sex scene did seem very out-of-the-blue. We haven't had any clues that Alana is bisexual, and there didn't seem to be any evident practical reason for both of them to have sex.  EDIT: a word"
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,g2gen,2,Wed Jul 15 23:25:55 2015 UTC,We haven't had any clues that Alana is bisexual   Hannibal is kinda metro if you think about it
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,mokoko__,8,Thu Jul 16 07:37:25 2015 UTC,"He also is into some weird fetishes, namely role playing as a wendingo."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,g2gen,7,Thu Jul 16 13:35:21 2015 UTC,"A lot of people seem to have been taken off guard by it, but I can understand to a certain degree.   It reminds me of the 'make me feel good' scene in Monster's Ball. (Spoilers!) Halle Berry's character experiences two major tragedies one after another, and basically just wants someone to have sex with and simply make her feel good. It happens to be Billy Bob Thornton's character, whom she barely knows.  In the absence of any other (useful) men, or maybe being even tired of men after the betrayal she's been though, Alana just wants to feel good with someone, and it happens to be Margot. In the book Margot is a lesbian, on the show I think she made a comment about her sexuality in season 2 but I don't remember. Anyways just my two cents."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,strangedange,6,Wed Jul 15 07:14:24 2015 UTC,Her homosexuality is addressed in Season 2 more than once I believe.
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,FatherDude,2,Wed Jul 15 12:20:20 2015 UTC,"I don't want to spoil anything for you, but I have a theory as to why they rushed the relationship.

HannibalTV,3dcrv3,Karmakerosene,9,Wed Jul 15 07:20:03 2015 UTC,"It seems you're suggesting that Margot might be manipulating Alana for her uterus, just as she used Will for his sperm?  It's an interesting thought."

HannibalTV,3dcrv3,Ascarea,3,Wed Jul 15 09:15:35 2015 UTC,"That was an intermingling dream sequence.  In reality it was Alana and Hannibal having sex in one location while Will and Margot were having sex elsewhere.  Though their physical bodies were separate, their minds were still thinking of the other characters... creating the psychic foursome."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,ApproBAT,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:58 2015 UTC,"There was that really disturbing foursome, so in a way yes they did."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,atuinsbeard,2,Wed Jul 15 10:26:41 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure it was supposed to catch us off guard and will be better explained in future.
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,flawlesslylogical,2,Wed Jul 15 14:42:18 2015 UTC,"I don't think Alana is bisexual, strictly speaking. I think she and Margot are both attempting to use sex as a weapon to achieve their endgame. What their respective endgames are we will soon discover, I'm sure. I don't think Alana is looking for comfort or distrustful of men because of Hannibal or whatever. I think she knows exactly what she's after and sex is just another tool she can use to get it."
HannibalTV,3dcrv3,thefrenchhornguy,3,Thu Jul 16 02:36:37 2015 UTC,"Alana's personality is very different this season, and I believe this may also apply to her sexual tastes.

HannibalTV,3dcqgw,akuma_river,8,Wed Jul 15 19:46:53 2015 UTC,I think the dolarhyde will purposely mimic that death scene (with direction from Lector possibly) which would allow for it's recreation
HannibalTV,3dcqgw,Jaywearspants,2,Wed Jul 15 20:42:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was thinking the same because it was really big news when it fake happened and it's just like a serial killer (the Dragon) wanting attention to mimic and perfect it.

I also know it's a line from the novel but for the life of me can't remember if it was just Paul Krendler being an ass or something was in the broth

HannibalTV,3ddg1n,dazed118,2,Thu Jul 16 14:35:47 2015 UTC,I want to say he said Scopolamine but that doesn't necessarily make sense as its an anti nausea medicine.   I'm going to have to watch Hannibal when I get home because it's driving me crazy now
HannibalTV,3ddg1n,whoatethekidsthen,2,Thu Jul 16 14:40:50 2015 UTC,"Found the script online. http://sfy.ru/?script=hannibal2001  ""I admit I added a little something extra to yours.  Perhaps it's clashing with the cumin.""   Maybe I'm remembering something from the book."
HannibalTV,3ddg1n,dazed118,2,Thu Jul 16 15:45:56 2015 UTC,Awesome! Thank for finding that
HannibalTV,3ddg1n,whoatethekidsthen,2,Thu Jul 16 15:53:56 2015 UTC,"You're very welcome.   The same site has the scripts for Lambs and Manhunter, but not Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising."
HannibalTV,3ddg1n,dazed118,2,Thu Jul 16 15:59:48 2015 UTC,"Ooooh, I'm definitely going to check those out"
HannibalTV,3ddg1n,whoatethekidsthen,3,Thu Jul 16 16:02:06 2015 UTC,"""The soup doesn't taste very good"" is a quote from the movie Hannibal."
HannibalTV,3ddg1n,drh0usemd,4,Wed Jul 15 14:51:19 2015 UTC,It was a drug to make him compliant while he cuts through his head.
HannibalTV,3ddg1n,Wicelo,7,Wed Jul 15 15:25:32 2015 UTC,"He had already given Will a drug.  He identifies the broth as a parsley and thyme infusion, and I don't believe we're meant to believe he's lying.  He's flavoring Will."
HannibalTV,3ddg1n,FatherDude,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:57:12 2015 UTC,He's flavoring Will.   :-D
