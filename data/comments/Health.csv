Evidence shows that teen pregnancies and abortions are reduced with easy access to free, long term birth control.  What makes me completely against the pro life movement is that is is conflated with the abstinence movement which teaches the same little girls that are later going through unwanted pregnancies that birth control e.g. condoms doesn't work and denying them accurate information and choices over their own bodies.

Determining a cause relationship at an individual level should be next to impossible. Only a class action law suit would be relevant. Of course you could get an evaluation of the plaintiff's potential causes of the cancer and see how the risk from smoking compares with all of the other causes - then the payout would be weighted down according to the relative proportion of the smoking risk.

There should be at least once an appointment with a doctor that explains the risks and benfits, how to take it, what to be aware of and so on. Many oral contraceptives come with a risk for thrombosis, so you would advice a patient for example to be extra careful when travelling, stop smoking and not take that kind of pill if you have a certain disease that makes your blood coagulate faster. Also, for a lay-person it would be difficult to asses which oral contraceptive tends to have which secondary effects and which one would be better for them."

Health,3duanw,TiredUnicorn,9,Sun Jul 19 23:55:07 2015 UTC,"Try looking for sudofed, nicotine products, or a levonorgestril two-step emergency contraceptive formulation on the shelves. Those are all examples of ""behind the counter"" meds that you don't need a prescription for, but must speak with pharmacy staff in order to gain access to. Another similar example is vaccination. You can go into many pharmacies and receive flu vaccines, but not before participating in a health screening performed by a pharmacist.   This law will make it so pharmacists may perform the health screening required to obtain birth control without a doctor's prescription."
Health,3duanw,keepingitcivil,2,Mon Jul 20 02:13:06 2015 UTC,"I believe ""over the counter"" at least in the American English usage means ""available without prescription"" without implying that they may be kept on consumer accessable shelves.  Those products you list are over the counter drugs, they are just not shelf-accessable drugs.  They must literally pass over the pharmacy counter to be dispensed."
Health,3duanw,critropolitan,0,Mon Jul 20 04:21:03 2015 UTC,"You're technically right, although I personally wouldn't use ""over the counter"" to describe every medication that may be dispensed without a prescription. There is an emerging group of medications that are available without prescription, but must be dispensed under the authority of a licensed pharmacist. The term used to describe these medications is ""behind the counter,"" although this isn't a legal distinction and these medications are still technically ""over the counter.""   I guess the point I've been trying to make in this thread is that birth control won't be available to the public like aspirin or even the morning after pill -- which is what some may think of as ""over the counter"" -- but will instead be dispensed under the authority and clinical oversight of a more accessible health professional, like the flu vaccine."

Health,3duanw,waterproof13,3,Sun Jul 19 20:54:48 2015 UTC,"Examples of annoying hormonal changes when using the wrong (too high/not the right combination of hormones) dosage of birth control include:  -becoming overly emotional over random things, depression, crying over random little things (when you never used to cry), extreme irritability, breakthrough menstrual bleeding (ie. When you have spotting but you're not actually on your period), sometimes it can cause skin changes or make your acne worse or better...  If you're one of the women who happen to be unlucky and can't get the right dosage for yourself when you first go on birth control, it can be a huge pain in the ass to keep adjusting the dosages with your doctor and finding what's right for your body. It's not as simple as taking a pill a day for some women."
Health,3duanw,hplssrmantcxox,4,Sun Jul 19 21:06:56 2015 UTC,"They usually just prescribe a different one though, why should one not be able to just buy a different one without seeing a doctor? It's not like they order hormone tests to figure out which one to give you."
Health,3duanw,waterproof13,6,Sun Jul 19 21:17:34 2015 UTC,"I mean the principle/idea of being able to freely buy whatever birth control you want or need without having to go to a doctor and prescribe it for you is great; there's less hoops for you to go through as a patient and that's wonderful for those patients, especially women who get lucky and find the right birth control for themselves pretty early on!   ....but if you don't have the pharmacological/medical knowledge to switch birth control pills yourself without knowing the serious side effects you might cause or not knowing what to expect if you're on a screwed up dosage or what kind of pill you should try to choose after, you probably need medical counseling to help minimize the side effects."
Health,3duanw,hplssrmantcxox,14,Sun Jul 19 21:29:31 2015 UTC,And pharmacists are actually pretty well qualified to help you with this. Possibly even better than a doctor. Doctors are best at diagnosing. Pharmacists' ONLY job is the actual medicines. They tend to know them better than a doctor.

The problem is that in many pharmacies sales assistants will sell OTC drugs just calling and showing the pharmacist. Where will the purchaser receive advice on thrombosis risk and so on?  However, because of the costs of medical advice, I can see the value in increasing the availability, although the advice should be available for free for those that need it.

That's simply not true. Humans are not perfectly rational.  Take this guy, for example.  He's in financial difficulties, but still buys more expensive organic to avoid GMOs because of the false impression that they're safer.     No one is going to be forced to buy anything. They will just be more informed as to what they are buying.    So why not label things with the immigration status of the farmers?  Or their sexuality?  Or which astrological sign it was harvested under?  After all, people will just be more informed?   People buy organics now which are more expensive and there is no hard science saying that organic fruits and vegetables are healthier for us. People do their own due diligence and make a choice.    Which proves that consumers aren't rational.   The only reason that holds any weight for advocating taking that choice away from the consumer is because it will hurt the profit of transnational corporations.    NOBODY IS TAKING CHOICE AWAY!  Jesus Christ, people.  Did you not read what I already said?  Let me repeat it for you:   There already exist labels for food containing no GMOs:  ""non-GMO certified"" and ""organic"".

The current label works in exactly the same way as every other lifestyle label, such as organic, vegetarian, vegan, kosher, halal etc. It has a label (paid for by the food manufacturer as it's marketing) that is applied to food the adherents can eat, rather than being legally mandated to appear on literally everything they cannot eat, which would be as silly as having legally required trief/haram labels on literally every single food product that wasn't kosher/halal.   Are you seriously saying that it's all bullshit and GMO's are already labeled?   The notion that there's nothing whatsoever out there for the poor old anti-GM person is bullshit, yes. In fact, here's the label. So why are some organisations demanding a second label when one already exists now an does literally everything they claim they want? Well, have a look at what those organisations are very openly stating are their reasons for wanting a second label. They want to fear-monger to the public about GMOs to push them out the market and increase the turnover for the organic industry (or in the case of the quack ""Dr"" Mercola, sell more herbal ""treatments""), and they can't do it with the current label. If they get a new label, and have it treated in the same way as current essential health or nutrition information (currently the main criteria for mandatory labels) then they can scare people into not buying it by saying ""look, it's so dangerous and bad that it needed to be mandatorily labelled by the Government"".

From what I understand of insulin resistance, not only can it be caused by chronically elevated levels of glucose (which usually happens as a results of frequent eating as well as eating processed foods and foods with added sugars), but it can also come about as a result of a high-fat diet. From what I understand, fat in the bloodstream interferes with a cell's ability to take glucose out of the bloodstream -- in essence it results in chronically elevated glucose levels as well.  These videos here, here, and here show research to that effect. And personally I've know a few people who have very successfully managed their diabetes with a very high carb and very low-fat diet, similar to that condoned by Drs.

I may be entirely wrong, but imo, there has to be a difference when consuming simple sugars vs concentrated sugars/syrups. I can't be entirely sure what those caloric differences are (you can add 19g of sugar to 8 ounces of water, but you can also add 100g of sugar to water and it'll look exactly the same, but the viscosity changes), but it's pretty clear that we shouldn't be chugging syrup everyday."

Health,3dq6x8,jchazu,4,Sat Jul 18 19:15:20 2015 UTC,"My best understanding is that it's spikes in blood sugar that are the worst for a diabetic or a potential diabetic. Fiber slows down absorption of sugar into the blood stream, which makes fruit much healthier than added white sugar or syrup. I can give you my example. I am healthy weight and have normal fasting blood sugar, but I have diabetes in the family, so I bought a blood sugar meter to see which foods I should avoid to prevent it from happening. Essentially I measured my blood sugar levels after different meals. Turns out fruit doesn't raise my blood sugar all that much (there are some exceptions like grapes). Do you know what does, the most? White rice. So, personally, I use glycemic index more than absolute amount of carbs as a guideline. If you are not sure, I would recommend doing the same thing - get a meter and test what works and what doesn't."

Diabetics need to watch out for carbs - yes, too much sugar at once is bad, but a breakfast of fruit and cereal could be bad as well. The goal is 45-60 carbs per meal - cereal has carbs, fruit has carbs, therefore you can't just say ""hurp I'm eating healthy!"" and have as much of that as you want. A cup of rice is hardly different from a cup of ice cream when it comes to diabetes.   The report warns us to replace these foods with five portions of fruit and vegetables, combined with starchy foods like potatoes and rice to avoid getting diabetes.   Another inaccurate statement. Potatoes and rice might be tasty, but if you're diabetic or worried about it, eat them sparingly. If you can, you should go for whole weat as your main source of carbs.  There's also the sad truth that, much to the chagrin of the fat-hating crowd, diabetes has a large genetic component. Yes, even T2. The vast majority of obese people can eat all they want, and won't get diabetes - meanwhile, it's possible that you could develop T2 despite a normal weight and decent diet. Or maybe a less-than-ideal diet, but still, you're way better off than a lot of fat people who DON'T have diabetes. Not saying that diet and exercise isn't important, but far too often, diabetes is treated as a tool of shame rather than the serious disease it is."

I love these things that I have mentioned, but I do not eat them all the time. I enjoy fruits and vegetables. I do exercise regularly, but am not as active as I'd like to be, and I've never been good at dieting, so I am a bit overweight as the BMI goes.   Thing is, diabetes, heart issues, and cancer run in my family, along with a number of other things, so it concerns me. I've treated my body like shit in the past, but have quit smoking and rarely drink. The damage has been done. So I look for information, but answers seem to vary quite a bit. I type in google ""does sugar cause diabetes?"", It basically says: The tendency to get diabetes 2 is mostly inherited. Still, eating too much sugar or food with sugar, like candy or soda, can cause weight gain, and weight gain can increase a person's risk for developing the disease.   My question is, if you eat right and are not obese, but enjoy sweets, is it likely you will develop the disease?"
Health,3dq6x8,kutwijf,2,Sun Jul 19 01:22:19 2015 UTC,"Well, as a serious question, there are a lot of factors.  First off, there is a huge dietary component for most instances of diabetes.  I don't understand why many doctors downplay this, or at least fail to emphasize it.  Yes, there are some people who get it by purely genetic bad luck, but the vast majority of people eat themselves into it ... and could eat themselves out of it or at least delay the onset for a long time by changing their diet and exercising.  Even if you have a family history of diabetes, your diet and exercise patterns can greatly influence the onset and progression of diabetes.  Before I go too much further, I should say that I'm in med school and this is the source of much of my information on the topic.  Because most of the people we will be treating will be overweight and/or diabetic, it is a huge thing that we discuss at length over and over.   The tendency to get diabetes 2 is mostly inherited. Still, eating too much sugar or food with sugar, like candy or soda, can cause weight gain, and weight gain can increase a person's risk for developing the disease.   This is extremely misleading.  Technically it is correct.  The real problem is blood sugar control.  If the body body isn't controlling blood glucose properly, then one start getting swings of hypoglycemia / hyperglycemia, and this can drive someone into diabetes fairly quickly.  But why isn't the body controlling blood sugar very well?  Here's where it gets complicated.  The thing to remember is that the failure of blood sugar control -- for most people -- is driven by the regular consumption of refined carbohydrates (sugar, white bread, white pasta, and so on).  Even if the failure is genetic in origin, what you eat (and how you eat it) makes a huge difference in how long your pancreas will work for you.  I'll keep this as short as I can.  Sugar goes into your bloodstream, pancreas secretes insulin, insulin tells your fat and muscle cells to suck up glucose out of the bloodstream.  But if your fat and muscle cells are already full and can't process more, they don't respond to insulin and glucose remains in your bloodstream.  Glucose in your blood is highly neurotoxic, so your pancreas secretes more and more and more to try to force someone, anyone, to take up the glucose.  Eventually, the fat and muscle cells do take up the glucose.  But now the pancreas gets burned out because it is worked too hard.  Key points if you want your pancreas to last a long time:  (1) Exercise burns glucose out of your muscles and blood stream.  Key point: YOUR PANCREAS DOES NOT HAVE TO WORK TO GET GLUCOSE OUT OF YOUR BLOOD.  It's practically a get-out-of-jail-free card.  If you exercise after you eat, even if you are squarely in type II diabetes, it greatly reduces the amount of insulin you need.  If your pancreas is still working, it does not have to work as hard and you will preserve its function for much longer.  (2) Major blood sugar swings are literally the devil.  If you consume sugar, it should be in the context of exercise to get it out of blood without stressing the pancreas.  If you consume breads, pasta, cereals, or other refined carbohydrates, it should be whole grain whenever possible and it should be consumed with some kind of fat.  Butter, olive oil, coconut oil, anything high quality.  Fats help control blood sugar.  (Stay away from trans fats, those will fuck you up and those are the whole reason ""saturated fats"" got a wrongful bad name a few decades ago.)  (3) Artificial sweeteners are really bad.  The reason is because the brain stimulates the pancreas based on the taste of things you put in your mouth.  If you drink a diet soda, the brain thinks you drinking something with a ton of sugar and stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin.  Insulin hits your blood stream, but surprise! there's no sugar to absorb.  The muscles and fat cells in your body suck up whatever glucose is in your blood, and voila! you are hypoglycemic and very hungry.  Artificial sweeteners make you hungry for real sugar, and contribute to blood sugar swings.  If something here peaks your interest and you want to learn more, I can dig up some references and citations.  This is what I have for you off-the-cuff, though.  I hope I've included enough physiology for it to make sense.  I feel that if you know how your body is working, you can treat it properly so it lasts a long time for you.  Since you have a family history of heart disease and diabetes, this is probably crucial for you if you want to live a long and healthy life.  Remember: Even if you got a bad roll of genetic dice, how you treat your body can completely change the onset and progression of chronic disease."
