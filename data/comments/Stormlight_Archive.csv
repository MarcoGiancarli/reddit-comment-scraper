Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,W1ULH,15,Mon Jul 20 19:57:52 2015 UTC,The honorblade doesn't scream because if I recall correctly it's not a spren (dead or alive). The spren are just a way that humans could emulate the honorblades.   As for the idea of the resurrection of shardblades it has come up before and I vaguely recall a WoB saying that it was definitely possible.
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,RiW-Kirby,11,Mon Jul 20 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"Actually, all Honorblades are Shardblades but Shardblades are not necessarily Honorblades.    Can you confirm if the scene with Taln at the end of Way of Kings is entirely in Hoid's perspective? There was some discussion that it might not be, since Taln's honourblade was called a shardblade.  That entire scene is in Hoid's POV, and the reason for it being called a shardblade is because honourblades are shardblades."
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,Craysh,3,Mon Jul 20 21:28:27 2015 UTC,"So, if Honorblades are all Shardblades, does that mean that they're all spren too? And if so, why are they different than regular Shardblades?"
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,HagOWinter,12,Mon Jul 20 23:00:20 2015 UTC,"To the best of my knowledge, Honorblades were given to the Heralds by Honor and are actually just magic swords. Shardblades happened when the spren figured out how to imitate a similar effect."
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,JordtasticBagel,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:32 2015 UTC,"Is the definition of a Shardblade a spren that turns into a weapon, or is it just any weapon that has a similar effect in the Cognitive Realm?"

BRANDON SANDERSON Yes, they are exactly the same thing. He is a Shardblade that is twisted and is a lot more powerful than normal.   In another post, Sanderson stated Nightbloood is sorta like robot spren."

It wasn't quite successful."
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,chatokun,4,Tue Jul 21 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that Honor took pieces of himself to shape into the Honorblades, just like honor spren are pieces of Honor. The pieces didn't have conciousness like spren did, because they were formed entirely from the cognitive realm, without a human personifying them.   Some other spren learned to do the same thing, but they aren't large/powerful enough to break off pieces of themselves into shards. Instead, they form their entire bodies into the shard blades."
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,brainpower4,6,Tue Jul 21 01:24:59 2015 UTC,"stormfather's objection to Dalinar having a shardblade was that it was a dead spren... and he told dalinar he would not manifest as a blade for him... hence my curiosity of would stormfather allow dalinar to have an honorblade?  which I guess lends the question... if a knight bonds the honor blade of another order, does he now know 4 surges instead of two or three?"
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,sgs500,6,Mon Jul 20 20:11:43 2015 UTC,"Honorblades and shardblades are 2 different things. So the shardblades are dead spren, hence the screaming. Honorblades are more special and are the heralds' blades. They have similar characteristics to sharblades, I believe, but also give the bearer the ability to absorb and use stormlight for surgebinding.   Hopefully this clears up your confusion: http://coppermind.net/wiki/Honorblade http://coppermind.net/wiki/Shardblade  Edit: I'm stupid and bad at reading comprehension. You already understood this. I think it's possible Dalinar could use the honorblade but the heralds might need them back for the upcoming fight if they are involved."

I do not believe that a person who has undergone the oaths of their order can carry an honorblade.  First, the practical reason - because they make those oaths, like Syl, redundant.  But most importantly of all the oaths represent more than just words.    A surgebinder of any order, with their Spren, would simply not accept an honorblade.  They made oaths, performed deeds to prove who both they and their Spren were.  They will not use an honorblade.  The Parshendi, however..."
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,magahsama,7,Tue Jul 21 00:48:45 2015 UTC,"WoB says that it is very definitely possible, but that it is very very difficult, ranging on to impossible.  (note, the one who ""killed"" the spren in the first place could bring it back through a change of heart and holding back to their ideals, but in this case, the original bearer is dead.)   A new bearer could, if they had the same ideal / ideology as the previous bearer, potentially rez the spren IF things happen exactly as they did before.    Sanderson said it was so unlikely that it would never happen.  That said, I still think Adolin is going to wake up his sword and be a dustbringer personally.    Honorblades do not scream because they are not and never were alive.  They were made (likely) by Honor and / or cultivation.  (whereas spren are literally just fragments of an ideology.)   The storm father, who may or may not be the cognitive existence of Honor, finds their usage repulsive, as they are a reminder of the heralds, who reneged on their oaths.    Dalinar's blade should come from the stormfather, but, he being super powerful and a class above regular spren refuses to allow himself to be made to function like that.  Other regular spren would not do that.  They are largely just trying to learn and experience humanity, something so very very different from everything they know / knew.    Kaladin doesn't so much have an honor blade as he is protecting the blade from being used by one such as szeth again.  Syl still has respect for the old ways and the heralds.  The stormfather really doesn't.  Syl would then want that protected for the returning of the heralds.  (we don't actually know that will happen, sanderson did say that it isn't as easy to break the oaths as they think.    So, TL;DR  Blades can potentially resurrect, WoB says it is so hard it will probably never happen.  Stormfather doesn't approve of honor blades.  Kal isn't using his.  It would be less efficient for him to use it than to use Syl anyways."
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,mooglefrooglian,5,Mon Jul 20 20:55:32 2015 UTC,Adolin's Shardblade is an Edgedancer spren (it manifests as vines when being summoned).

Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,Enasor,3,Tue Jul 21 02:31:55 2015 UTC,"Sanderson said it was so unlikely that it would never happen.   Actually no. He never said it would be impossible. He was very careful in each of his intervention on the subject to leave the room open for someone to pull it of. However, it is clear we are not going to see massive dead-Blade revival. If it happens, it will be a one Blade deal and an extremely rare occurrence of full compatibility between Blade and wielder.  Edit: I had missed the end of the post where you do state reviving a Blade is possible, even if highly unlikely and difficult. Adolin will be an Edgedancer though, not a Dustbringer. He is more fitted for the former, I think, than the later."

Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,xbauks,3,Tue Jul 21 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"WoB is that it's possible to resurrect a dead shardblade however its incredibly difficult. He hasn't mentioned what the result would be but I assume it would be the same as bonding to a live spren. At the beginning of chapter 87 of WoR, Syl explains that just because a spren dies doesn't mean that it's gone. Unlike humans, even if a spren dies, it is still there. Waiting to bond with someone so it can come alive.   Regarding the honourblade, Syl said its very dangerous. Not just because it requires the person wielding it to use a lot of stormlight, but also because the power it bestows can be used without any of the safety measures the radiants have. So I think Kal is going to be very hesitant in giving it to anyone. He will probably delibrate quite a bit before trusting someone with it.   As for the stormfather, he might have a problem with the honourblade. The Heralds betrayed Honour. So the stormfather might still be holding a grudge."
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,dce42,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:31 2015 UTC,"I wonder if jezeran took up his old honor blade, would he would be himself again. Or if his current state had more to due with being away from his normal fate."
Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,xbauks,3,Mon Jul 20 20:56:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe. I doubt it has anything to do with the Honourblade. Probably more to do with the Oathpact. If he were to rejoin the Oathpact, I think he can mostly go back to being the way he was. I'm sure the experience will have changed him and he won't be exactly the same, but I think he can definitely become the regal leader he used to be."

Stormlight_Archive,3dzgfd,kesterr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:16:25 2015 UTC,"So Sanderson describes the shard blades as spren who had a large part of their minds ripped out. In those terms he said, theoretically it is possible to reawaken them by restoring what was lost.   But the pain and drama they experienced, plus the overall difficulty of finding someone they would bond with to revive them makes 'resurrecting them' nigh on impossible."

This is a real if:  If Brandon doesn't tell us what's up with his boon and curse (and wife), then he's a shit author who needs to learn to foreshadow.  Having read his books, it's obvious that his wife and the curse will be the focus of the flashbacks. There's no reason to put it in if you're not going to explain it, and there's nowhere else to explain it except in his flashbacks as a featured character.  For Kaladin: We meet him as a captain and then again as a slave. It was obvious that the flashbacks would explain how it happened.  For Shallan: We meet her as she's plotting to steal from the royal family to save her family because her father died with debts. It was obvious that the flashbacks would explain how her father died.  For Dalinar,: We meet him in the midst of hallucinations. These have been explained, and are not necessary in the flashbacks (but probably will be). What isn't explained is the wife and his request from the Nightwatcher. It's the obvious topic and will probably be revealed ~85% of the way through the book. The other main topic will be Gavilar and Navani.  For Szeth: We meet him as an assassin, Truthless of Shinovar. We barely know of Shinovar. We don't know what it means to be Truthless. We don't know why he calls himself son-son- instead of son-. These are all topics that will certainly be explain in his flashbacks.  For Eshonai: We now know that she was there the night of the prologues, so in her flashbacks I expect to find out why the Parshendi killed Gavilar. Beyond that I don't know much, and expect better foreshadowing in the upcoming book."

He may not have answered my personal questions, but he sure worked hard to give his readers feedback. There are many authors out there who do not care to do even half of what Brandon does.  Brandon also is a very aware writer who knows full well what his readers want to read about: I have NO doubt he will tie on the lose ends and give us satisfaction when it comes to Dalinar's flashbacks. To think he may do otherwise is to simply ignore all of the WoB and interview the man had given: he cares about his readers, a lot.

Or does Dalinar have that much more to do?  Additionally, what percentage of the last books were flashbacks. If it's like 10% on average then yeah, maybe we'll see a 500k word book?"
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,StickerBrush,6,Thu Jul 16 15:50:33 2015 UTC,"I doubt he's looking at it in terms of distributing a word count equally between the characters. I don't feel like going through and adding up percentages but I feel like Kal's flashbacks were longer/took up more space of Way of Kings than Shallan's did Words of Radiance. I could be wrong though, that's just my impression. But generally I would guess that he's trying to balance each book individually between live action and flashback, instead of making all of them even throughout the series. 55k words in a 400k word book is still only like 13%. I would be interested in exact numbers from the first two though..  Also, part of it may be that Dalinar has had a much longer time to live than Kaladin or Shallan, has several decades worth of life experiences, and thus a lot more to write about."

Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,_0_-o--__-0O_--oO0__,8,Thu Jul 16 21:50:39 2015 UTC,So next book is Dalinar not Szeth?
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,rawrzorzz,9,Thu Jul 16 14:44:35 2015 UTC,Yup - He changed it about a month ago maybe? Tentative title is Oathbringer.  Woah - its my cakeday!
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,bchprty,10,Thu Jul 16 14:53:00 2015 UTC,"I thought that I read somewhere that each book was going to have the name of an in-world book, so that the Stormlight Archive was really an archive. So a book named after Dalinar's former blade doesn't make sense."
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,Deadspyder88,12,Thu Jul 16 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"That is what Brandon was going for, but I am not sure if he is fully committed yet. Also Oathbringer could be named after a book......"
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,bchprty,7,Thu Jul 16 15:33:04 2015 UTC,It's a shame he couldn't get Stones Unhallowed. I would've been okay with The Highprince of War too.  Oathbringer? I'm kinda eh on that one.
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,HagOWinter,11,Thu Jul 16 16:11:08 2015 UTC,Stones Unhallowed could still be Szeth's book 5.
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,bchprty,3,Thu Jul 16 16:22:46 2015 UTC,Oathbringer is probably just extremely fitting for Dalinar. Possibly more so now that he is a Bondsmith.   I'm also thinking (assuming) that the title Oathbringer is relevant to Dalinar's encounter with the Nightwatcher.
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,rawrzorzz,3,Thu Jul 16 17:42:46 2015 UTC,Highprince of War sounds too generic to me personally

Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,LordCitrus,4,Fri Jul 17 00:39:14 2015 UTC,"Attacking is a very strong word, it was just a casual comment. Personally I think that titles are really only important for the first couple of books in a series. Once the series has been established, the titles are only important for the people that have already read the other books. Surely new readers won't be put off of a series by the name The Highprince of War considering they shouldn't even be reading that book yet. People that have already read the books know just how important the Highprinces are, especially what the Highprine of War represents to the greater Roshar, considering the series is moving away from the Shattered Plains and towards Urithiru and Kholinar.  Although honestly I like the name Oathbringer just as much, but chances are he'll change the name again before the book is truly finished."
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,hodgkinsonable,2,Fri Jul 17 01:05:48 2015 UTC,"Oathbringer is a name of a book in-world, so it doesn't break the pattern"

Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,JulianWyvern,6,Thu Jul 16 15:34:48 2015 UTC,"I have much Higher Expectations for these Dalinar sequences than any other character. We have a lot of potential action to focus on. Duels and wars of unification, maybe some early training stuff, and him training Adolin. And we finally really get to meet Galivar which I am very excited for. I'm sure we'll get a few glimpses of things happening that Dalinar was too drunk to figure out but we'll understand the significance of it.   I thought the flashbacks were the weakest parts of the books so far. To some extent I felt they took us out of the pace of the actual story. Though I did enjoy the views and glimpses of where those flashbacks took us and we did learn a lot, but the pacing on some of them were tough to bear."
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,theelbandito,2,Thu Jul 16 21:51:44 2015 UTC,"I am not sure we are going to see him train Adolin... The flashback will probably stop at Galivar's death, though surely we are going to get a few glimpses of the boys as children.

Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,LordCitrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:31:08 2015 UTC,The interludes between parts of the book are a whole different story than the flashbacks. Think of Kaladin and Shallan remembering their youth. In the first and second books.

Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,TweetPoster,3,Thu Jul 16 14:13:03 2015 UTC,This man is a machine.  If Grrm was even a quarter of the writer Sanderson is ASoIaF would have been finished years ago.
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,lordofsoup,18,Thu Jul 16 15:36:36 2015 UTC,"To play devil's advocate, I think it's unfair to measure a writer's skill by his output quantity. Is Sanderson a faster writer? Undoubtedly, and in terms of quality-to quantity ratio, he again probably wins. But I think using that one metric as the defining trait is a bit harsh."
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,Ulmaxes,6,Thu Jul 16 16:04:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the argument to that would be that the last 3 ASOIAF haven't been getting better, and GRRM shortest time between books was like 5 years, while Sanderson has been getting better and faster between books.   Sanderson will probably end up much like Terry Pratchett in the sense of the scope of his universe, except for with Sanderson, we won't get to see the entire historical development of a single world (vertical history telling). However, we will see a massive amount of what happens in the span of a single, linear time (horizontal history telling)."
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,Chonoon,4,Thu Jul 16 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"Then we move into the entirely different discussion about what does make one writer 'better' than another. I tend to avoid such discussion when there is not an immense gap in skill (Stephanie Myers versus Terry Pratchett, for example.)"
Stormlight_Archive,3di8ug,Ulmaxes,2,Thu Jul 16 18:50:19 2015 UTC,"Personally, I would be wary to use any metric other than the finished product.

In other words, because ""the assassin in white"" became a thing, Taravingian said ""OK let's keep rolling with that."""
Stormlight_Archive,3d7mmy,StickerBrush,2,Tue Jul 14 13:06:15 2015 UTC,"Basically, yes. The Persona of the assassin in white had already been created, so they went with it because it would be recognizable by everyone as well as Taravingan wanted each death be connected to each other, if I recall.   But the original comment was that the Parshendi customs required him to wear white as an assassin because (paraphrasing) ""if you would assassinate a man, he should see you coming"""
Stormlight_Archive,3d7mmy,Brorgyll,2,Tue Jul 14 16:52:11 2015 UTC,"I thought the Parshendi had nothing to do with it. They just took the situation and made it their own. That's how I perceived things, Was I wrong?"
Stormlight_Archive,3d7mmy,Snowfire870,2,Tue Jul 14 11:12:58 2015 UTC,"In WoR, they talk about explicitly hiring him because of something the king was going to do.  It's not very clear exactly what they were so afraid of, but there is no doubt that they hired the assassin."
Stormlight_Archive,3d7mmy,jmcqk6,2,Tue Jul 14 13:00:23 2015 UTC,"Well the two theories I believe is either that a faction of the Parshendi wanted to continue with the war so they could summon the everstorm.  The other one, though it may have been in the book too (I've forgetten), is that Gavilar got drunk and admitted he wanted to kill the parshendi as a way to bring back the Heralds."
Stormlight_Archive,3d7mmy,Brorgyll,3,Tue Jul 14 17:02:42 2015 UTC,"He wanted to bring back their Gods, not kill them. That's why they had him assassinated. As we can see with Eshonai (and a certain Mistborn character), to be enslaved and committing atrocities while still mentally feeling what you've done us a fate worse than death. Come to think of it, Szeth too, though he was physically and mentally in control, if not morally."
Stormlight_Archive,3d7mmy,chatokun,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:15:07 2015 UTC,"There's an interesting comparison here between the experience of being enslaved and committing atrocities while mentally feeling what you've done (on the one hand) vs. committing atrocities because you've sworn an oath to do whatever you are told as punishment for a crime, but still knowing them to be atrocities and believing yourself to be morally culpable for them (on the other hand).  That moment when the latter character learns that he had committed no crime and so need not have been bound by the oath? That was terrible."

Sorry I haven't been in the limelight this week, I decided I needed a vacation so I wrote three new books, hopefully those will be out soon."" - BS"
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,zonine,9,Sun Jul 12 21:59:54 2015 UTC,Man only three new books? He really did take a vacation that week
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,kaggzz,8,Sun Jul 12 23:37:00 2015 UTC,"Read at your own pace.  But keep in mind that even though Sanderson does not sleep and is powered only by the words he writes, this will be a ten book series. So we all have quite some time before the conclusion.  For me that just means plenty of time to reread, which is surprisingly important with novels of this size.  I'm on my first reread of the series and am enjoying it just as much as the first read though for different reasons.  There are so many little nuances and hints at what is going to happen that you will completely miss unless you know what you're looking for and those little hints are part of what will keep me coming back to this series and anxiously awaiting his next installment."
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,Guffertothecore,5,Sun Jul 12 21:31:00 2015 UTC,Is it silly that I'm looking forward to rereading it even though I'm only a third of the way through the first book? I can't wait until I know all the characters by name and I see all the foreshadowing and conflict building. I generally don't like rereading shorter books. But I think you made a good point- rereading a novel this large is an entirely different experience.
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,DreamlordOneiron,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:14:03 2015 UTC,"Re-reading any Sanderson book is a great experience. There are so many different layers of foreshadowing, from the basic character conflicts to the hints of Things going on in the background. Some of the epigraphs even contain hints to events in books that have yet to be released."
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,Snowfire870,3,Mon Jul 13 15:47:59 2015 UTC,10?!??!!!! You just made my day. I was expecting only 3.

Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,Snowfire870,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:38:05 2015 UTC,"The other stuff is good too though (granted, it's no SA). While I'd love a SA book every year, it's almost better having 2-3 Sanderson books a year even if they're in different series."
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,wanna-be-writer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:31:05 2015 UTC,Yeah but I have pretty much caught upbwith all his books minus a few. Just got done with the 2 SA books again

Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,zameon,11,Mon Jul 13 02:41:53 2015 UTC,"Are there any resources for remembering characters you all would recommend?   I don't know if you'll need it, when I was reading the first book I wasn't paying as much attention as I should have, so after a while it became hard to keep track of all the characters. Fortunately, I found this piece of fanart. It wasn't necessarily how I imagined them all, but it assigned a simple, recognizable drawing to each name, so whenever I forgot who each of them was, I paused and took a look at the picture. It helped. Maybe you won't need help keeping track of the characters, but if you do this is one way to do it."

I might suggest reading Warbreaker and the first Mistborn trilogy (and maybe Elantris) before you move on to Words of Radiance. In a way, they are all connected and as the series progress, the connections could play a more important roll..."
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,OgreLord,3,Sun Jul 12 21:57:23 2015 UTC,Yeah different worlds same Universe with some people doing some hopping but that wasn't something I knew till I found this subreddit. It adds so much more depth

Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,OgreLord,3,Mon Jul 13 01:23:18 2015 UTC,"Nothing too huge, but I would read Warbreaker right after you finish... It gives an extra twist to one of the final scenes in WoR. I think the Warbreaker tie ins will be much more important for the 3rd Stormlight book."
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,milamber84906,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:12:21 2015 UTC,"Excellent, thanks. One more question, hopefully it isn't a stupid one, but is warbreaker a stand alone book? Or part of a series?"
Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,Beer_in_an_esky,2,Mon Jul 13 02:21:35 2015 UTC,Right now it's a stand alone (or as alone as one can be in the Cosmere) but I do believe there is a sequel planned... But who knows when that will be written.

Stormlight_Archive,3d1oot,wanna-be-writer,2,Sun Jul 12 21:28:44 2015 UTC,"I promise you, I have ""read"" the series more times than any other living person. I checked my Audible account and I have listened to WoR for about 3000 hours since it came out last years. I have listened to WoK about as often.  I had a really hard time getting into the first book. I had just finished The Inheritance Cycle and was looking for something in that vein. What I did accidently was hear the ending, the last 4 chapters. Then a single moment of self sacrifice changed my mind on the series. I was hooked, totally and completely. Something about it spoke to me in a way a piece of art never has. I am not in some weird place where I think about 100% of the time but I listen to it constantly when I have down time. This series deserves all the praise it gets.  As far as understanding the characters and keeping track of them, I never had a real problem doing that. I just suggest giving each book at least a second read. I know they are the size of small libraries but just pick it up, after you first reading, and read a chapter or a page. It will be satisfying and interesting. It take a while to really see all the shadows that are lurking inside the subtext. It's amazingly well written. Even with its obvious faults, they are outweigh completely by the greatness and vastness of the story you're now participating in."

Like if you read ""War Breaker"" you'll get a lot more out WoR. Though it is not at all required."

Even though, if you think about it, the story of Kaladin follows exactly the same beats in both. I love them. I have listened to them so often I have concocted weird theories that get me laughed out of the 17th shard forums. Like, I think the original KR caused the High Storm. I am almost certain Kaladin's mom is Light eyed or a ""one eye"" (a dark and lighteyed person). I think that Noadon is one of the Heralds. Wit is Brandon Sander's Champion in his Cosmere, if not Brandon then Wit is the champion of the shard of Knowledge or Understanding. Those are just musings I have postulated over the many readthrough's of all the books. Save a couple. I love Elantris, but I'm not ""In Love"" with it."

Why have you cursed me so?” He screamed a pleading cry, then stood and cracked something against the wall. A rock? Where had he gotten it?
