Zappa,3e4byz,therefore4,3,Tue Jul 21 21:19:52 2015 UTC,"His greatest role EVER! I worked at a neighborhood movie theater all through college (1969-73) and ""200 Motels"" ran for something close to a month.  Needless to say, everyone who worked there had the whole thing memorized before long, especially the song lyrics. I was especially mesmerized by the sound track because I was going through this Karl-Heinz Stockhausen phase, and the inclusion of the Royal Phil seemed like a brilliant move to me -- especially the way Zappa used percussion toward the end.  I can still hear in my head the way Bikel delivered his lines in that final monologue, with sort of a sing-songy delivery:  ""...at the END of a MOVIE..."" I even remember finding the soundtrack on vinyl  -- it was at some record store in Golden Valley, Minn., in the early '80s  -- and playing it over and over.  It was great to finally see it come out on DVD.  Looks like I'll be up late tonight!  EDIT: We had this high school kid working at the theater during the time we showed ""200 Motels"" who was a major Captain Beefheart fan. The band had a moderate following in our part of the country (suburban Cleveland) that year because of a big concert they'd played in Pittsburgh that had apparently drawn people from all over the region. Anyway, I always felt Don van Vliet was a pale shadow of Zappa, and this guy at the theater (can't recall his name) would get really wound up whenever I'd cite exactly how and why the Mothers were so much better than Beefheart."

Zappa,3dplwm,machotaco,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:53:42 2015 UTC,Is it really like that in all of the release? I only got the 2012 remaster and the quality is really different. I do prefer the quality of Hot Rats than the ' Album.
Zappa,3dplwm,SpikeDescending,5,Sat Jul 18 13:39:10 2015 UTC,"One thing Ben Watson speaks about in ""the Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play"" regarding the difference in sound between ""Overnite Senation"" and Zappa's earlier albums is close-miking. Zappa used a far more ""intimate"" signing voice on this album as opposed to his earlier ones, and often spoke in a husky whisper or a low, quiet baritone when he sang, which gave those songs an almost tangible, uncomfortable intimacy to the listener. Plus, given the more sexual nature of the lyrics on ""Overnite' compared to the albums just previous, as Watson points out - if you were a countercultural consumer in 1973 and you bought ""Overnite,"" it was like asking for ""Rolling Stone"" and getting ""Playboy"" instead (na d back in 1973, those two magazine were VASTLY different publications). A lot of that difference is due to a more avowed ""commerical"" direction Zappa wanted to take after the Waka and Wazoo albums sold poorly. So he definitely focused on presenting much more commerical material in a much more polished way on ""Overnite,"" which may account for why it sounds so different that the albums that immediately preceded it. Also, as others have mentioned, in the early 70s, there was a great improvement in sound quality over all as more and more studios were working with greater amounts of tracks, working in quadrophinic sound, etc. Zappa, being an audiophile himself, took advantage of these new advances on that album."
Zappa,3dplwm,Badamn_187,2,Sat Jul 18 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"This is pretty common for all bands. Later in your career you have more money for better gear, a more streamlined process, more time."
Zappa,3dplwm,curdlegwad,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:22:07 2015 UTC,"I believe Frank was always on top of the latest innovations in recording technology, and that may have factored in to the change in sound you mention. But the most significant change was due to an accident he suffered in December of 1969 after he was pushed from a stage by a deranged fan. In the fall he suffered a crushed larynx and his vocal range was lowered by a third. You can clearly hear the difference in his pre/post accident recordings."

It’s become a live favorite due to the vocal-and-guitar unison melody and the infectious groove, and I’m glad that something oddly joyful came out of a dark time for me. It was a hard day anyway, as it had become clear that Frank Zappa was not going to survive the weekend – that’s not explicit in the lyric but it was an undercurrent to the whole thing, which made the whole strange event more unsettling, as everything about the world already felt askew at the time.

I didn't want to mob the band after the show, and I spotted Kurt smoking in an alley on my way out, and nobody had noticed him.

Does he go to the doctor? No. He finally collapses. They take him to the emergency room and find out that he’s got this severely enlarged prostate. Then, he refused to get the surgery that might have done something about it because maybe it involved cutting some bits off that he didn’t want cut off.   This makes me incredibly sad. Complete denial about cigarettes and cancer and he barely even bothered to try to take care of himself. Maybe if he had been going to the doctor and trusted them a bit more he would still be alive today."

Furthermore, the soloing over a weird time signature made me think other Zappa fans might take some interest in this, as well as the free section around 9 minutes in. Throw Jan Hammer's subtle synth touches, and I think you've got something that appeals to the jazzier Zappa fan."
Zappa,3c6h0w,bigswifty86,2,Sun Jul 5 08:00:51 2015 UTC,"This is a great Elvin piece, def has a free feel that should apeal to some open minded Frank fans. I believe Miles described Elvin's playing as, ""a blind man falling UP-stairs"". Incredibly apt description of Elvin's laid back and tumbling sound. I would have loved to see Zappa take charge of a capable jazz quar/quintet.  Starring;  Frank as himself,  Elvin/Cobham/Chester on the drums,  Stanley Clarke on Bass,  The Dukester/Chick Corea/Jan on Keys,  and DiMieola/Gambale/McLaughlin (if you could get him on an electric) on the guitar, hell even Jean Luc Ponty on the violin would be awesome.  Then if you're feeling saucy throw in a horn or two and you would have a Jazz Noise crew for the ages.  So basically put Frank as Co-lead to a Return to Forever line-up and I think I might have a cream dream supreme."
Zappa,3c6h0w,bigswifty86,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:03:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm, what would be a good jazz combo involving Frank? It'd have to be a group who excel at knotty themes and vamp based soloing. So, Frank on guitar + conducting, Robert Wyatt or Aynsley Dunbar on drums, maybe someone like Cecil McBee or Buster Williams on bass, George Duke and Don Preston sharing keyboard duties, Ian Underwood on various wind instruments, and JLP or Sugarcane Harris on violin. Really, my overall dream Zappa lineup would've been Zappa, Dunbar, Jack Bruce on Bass, Sugarcane on violin, Duke, and both of the Underwoods."

Zappa,3byeej,squirrellevel,3,Fri Jul 3 04:29:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's all really good. However, the Wolf Harbor thing is just noisy weirdness that goes on for too long. When you just have it on in the background it sounds annoying, bug when you pay attention, it's quite good. I think the album's good, not great. Just excited because this is the first Zappa album coming out since I've been a fan."
Zappa,3byeej,GrammarWizard,3,Sat Jul 4 07:30:50 2015 UTC,"This is the album I've been waiting for and it hasn't disappointed me. The production is certainly excellent. As a huge fan of Frank's other synclavier work, I can admit that it did have the tendency to sound cold and flat. But Dance Me This sounds warm, full and dynamic. And the variety of sounds and tones greatly exceeds that of any of the previous sync works.  This album is further proof of concept to me of why I loved CPIII and was so excited when I learned about it. Frank made a commitment when he got the synclavier to try to do things with it that nobody had thought to do with it. He wanted to create musical landscapes that couldn't be equaled in their inventiveness. And the next logical step from adding in the piano people was to properly (and near-seamlessly) integrate other instruments and vocals, along with other sound effects such as what I'm pretty sure is the old horn-in-the-cauldron-full-of-slop trick that was use in the Yellow Shark concerts.  It's a thoroughly enjoyable listen that admittedly will mostly appeal to the fans of the more experimental/avant-garde side of Frank and music in general. But for those fans I personally think it's amazing."
Zappa,3byeej,FajitaTaylor,2,Mon Jul 6 07:33:47 2015 UTC,Probably one of the more enjoyable of the Synclavier albums. I like how the samples got more realistic sounding towards the Civilization Phase III era with the Synclavier being almost indistinguishable from the Ensemble Moderne. Dance Me This is no exception. He even xenochronically added a guitar solo in there for good measure. I love when Zappa just plays his solos.

Zappa,3bo3s8,aj5dv,8,Tue Jun 30 20:26:53 2015 UTC,yea I remember having a similar moment to this in High school when I first heard Zappa. If I could recommend you some albums i'd say start with:  Hot Rats>Apostrophe>Overnight Sensation>Sheik Yerbouti
Zappa,3bo3s8,aj5dv,7,Tue Jun 30 20:20:13 2015 UTC,"In the middle of Hot Rats right now. I have no idea how Zappa, let alone anybody else, could even begin to put those sounds together. He's a rock composer."
Zappa,3bo3s8,aj5dv,6,Tue Jun 30 20:30:55 2015 UTC,"haha. Well it's my personal opinion that Zappa was just a guy who didn't fit in nor would want to be put in any box. His wheel house was jazz and orchestra music he rarely associated himself with popular music or rock music. The more you learn about him the more you find yourself sitting there going, ""how the hell is this a real person"" I say that in terms of the sheer amount of material he put out and the complex nature of it. He's my favorite musician and i'm sad I never got to see him perform."
Zappa,3bo3s8,ItsEman,5,Tue Jun 30 20:46:30 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what I meant. Like, if someone told me they liked rock, based on what I've heard I probably wouldn't tell them to listen to Zappa. But if someone really liked Beethoven and wanted to get into rock, I'd direct them to Zappa first, if that makes any sense."
Zappa,3bo3s8,aj5dv,2,Tue Jun 30 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely. I wasn't disagreeing with what you were saying, I was just pointing out since you are new to Zappa that he covers so many styles of music and genres he's really difficult to put in a genre. I just call his genre frank zappa. haha."
Zappa,3bo3s8,Daedeluss,4,Tue Jun 30 21:20:33 2015 UTC,"That's funny, all the FZ on my ipod I just put 'Zappa' as the genre.  Nothing else fits him right."

Zappa,3bo3s8,RonPolyp,3,Tue Jun 30 21:29:31 2015 UTC,"His works that you might consider ""jazzy"" or ""orchestral"" are still heavily framed through a rock lens"
Zappa,3bo3s8,aj5dv,3,Tue Jun 30 21:14:31 2015 UTC,"No don't get me wrong. He makes some great rock songs, I was just pointing out that he is an artist that i've tried time and time again to put into a genre and he constantly surprises me. I wasn't just saying he is strictly jazz or strictly orchestral. I was just pointing out that he has such a wide variety of musical styles that it's hard to put him in a rock box, or a jazz box, or classical box or whatever."
Zappa,3bo3s8,luckyjinxer,3,Tue Jun 30 21:18:41 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. That's also what, in my opinion, makes him the most important composer of rock music of the entire century. His willingness to defy tradition and even his own preconceived notions about music/sound led to some of the most fantastic musical works of the 20th century. Zappa didn't live inside the box, he blew the box open and then tried to keep going"
Zappa,3bo3s8,aj5dv,2,Tue Jun 30 21:33:10 2015 UTC,"People seem to forget that FZ was a huge fan of Doo-wop and 50s rhythm & blues. The Doo-wop influence in particular is pretty obvious at times. For example, ""Doreen"" and ""Goblin Girl"" are pretty much just Doo-wop songs with 80s instrumentation (and Frank's attitude, eyebrows, and garlic all over the place, of course)."
Zappa,3bo3s8,jamesprog,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:10:49 2015 UTC,"haha yea that's so true. I have this thought everyday. ""how does a guy who grew up in a California desert town, who listens to primarily rhythm and blues make this kind of music"" The album Cruising with Ruben & the Jets is heavily doo wop influenced.   I think for me i'm just so glad that I got into FZ. I'm not old enough to have had seen him live but it's a really weird feeling missing someone you never met. I'm just lucky he left around so much music for me to listen to in the mean time. haha."

Zappa,3bo3s8,Russkiy_To_Youskiy,7,Tue Jun 30 21:13:25 2015 UTC,"I've started with Joe's Garage too.  I'd recomment 'Sheik Yerbouti', 'You are what you is', 'Apostrophe', and maybe 'We're only in it for the money'."
Zappa,3bo3s8,RonPolyp,8,Tue Jun 30 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"I really dislike when people suggest that you start with a random album in an artist's discography just because it seems more ""listenable"" or ""accessible"" than other albums. Especially with Zappa, why not start at the top? Freak Out! is an excellent album that I think informs a lot of the rest of Zappa's work (along with the other albums record under the Mothers of Invention name)."
Zappa,3bo3s8,RevNimshi,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:13:09 2015 UTC,This is what I'm doing. Everyone here has given me so many great suggestions I decided the best way to do this was go back to the beginning.
Zappa,3bo3s8,EliQuince,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:39:10 2015 UTC,"It's tough to make it through some of those earlier albums if you're new to Zappa though. It almost is best to start in the mid 70's for most people who don't have the ear or patience to get through all that Mother's jamming that happened. I still find Weasels, Fillmore East, Burnt Weenie Sandwich, Lumpy Gravy and a couple others tough listens...."
Zappa,3bo3s8,jason_stanfield,2,Wed Jul 1 15:17:54 2015 UTC,"I always feel like I'm alone amongst Zappa fans in my love for Lumpy Gravy, Thingfish, and FZ Meets The Mothers of Prevention.   Maybe I could make a good rock star; I don't know. Huh...  But in all candor, I would tell you it's, it's outrageous filth..."
Zappa,3bo3s8,ItsEman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:49:44 2015 UTC,Mothers of Prevention is awesome! Thing Fish is an interesting listen but it's hard to make it all the way through that one.
Zappa,3bo3s8,ItsEman,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:34:32 2015 UTC,"When Thingfish came out I absolutely loved it at first listen. Jazz From Hell, not so much. Out of all the albums that's probably the one that's hardest for me to get through. Crabgrass Baby vocal effects on Thingfish were incredible for that time. I wanted something to get that effect, but never found anything until about 1995 when I found a vocal effects processor on the internet that some kid made. It was legit, and I could program it to do that same effect from Crabgrass Baby. I wish I could find that program now, but I'm sure its lost/gone for good."
Zappa,3bo3s8,ichimanu,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:16:50 2015 UTC,"Man From Utopia, followed by Mothers of Prevention were my first two. Then I had to have all of it, so I just started buying whatever I could find (pre-internet, and special ordering from most record stores was a huge hassle)."
Zappa,3bo3s8,Tom_Anks,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:21:50 2015 UTC,Lumpy Gravy is a jewel. I just listened to it yesterday. I really loved the melodies that ran through that album. I believe it's the first appearance of Oh No. I perfected my snork technique at age 15 thanks to this album.

Others might be intrigued by how different it is, but some might get scared away.  Whenever I discover an album I like, I alternate between working backwards and forwards from there. That way you get traces of what you fell in love with -- what made it happen, and what it inspired."

You can stream all of Frank's albums on iTunes for the next 90 days as part of the new Apple music free trial. Have fun dude. I can't imagine having that entire collection ahead of me.

The chemistry between Ike, Ray, and Frank is infectious, the songs are fun, and the album doesn't ask much of the listener. It's my favorite starter recommendation for people who are discovering the music. Volume 2 is easily my favorite of the YCDTOSA series though."

Zappa,3bo3s8,ItsEman,2,Wed Jul 1 01:57:15 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, it's time for live stuff baby. Joe's Garage got me hooked on Zappa as my second album, my first being a live show. I had Zappa in New York on repeat for maybe a month when I started, then did the safe for Joes Garage. Zappa's unique in that you'll likely find time periods you like more than others, but it'll take some time to work your way through and really identify what you like. Aside from watermelon in Easter hay, what were your favorite parts of Joe's Garage? That might help target a recommendation."
Zappa,3bo3s8,PaulTurkk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:24:10 2015 UTC,I enjoyed each song. But two of my other favorites are probably A Token of My Extreme and Crew Slut.

Anyway, others probably said it, but definitely start at the beginning of Zappa's work!  Freak Out! was the first Mothers of Invention album and it is stellar!"

Zappa,3bo3s8,thismoonlife,2,Wed Jul 1 05:54:45 2015 UTC,"Welcome, new friend!  With any artist, I've found that if you alternately work backwards and forwards in their catalog from what you fell in love with, you'll be happiest with your journey. That way you get the music that informed what you love, and the music it informs.  That said, Zappa's music changed a lot after Joe's Garage - the 80s made him really political, and a lot of that material is kind of dated (there's a rap song ... it's really, really awful) - so it might be best to just go backward from Garage, then move forward into the 80s with caution.  That said, Frank's music is varied and prolific. In 20 years of fandom, I have yet to find someone who adores everything he wrote and recorded -- most of the disinterest is in his formal orchestral and ensemble compositions, but pretty much all the musicians I know that are fans absolutely love them. Eventually, you'll build a solid playlist of hours of FZ's music.  And if you get the chance, go see his son Dweezil on a Zappa Plays Zappa tour.   You'll love it.   It's a way of life."
Zappa,3bo3s8,Daedeluss,2,Wed Jul 1 15:39:39 2015 UTC,OK people have covered studio album suggestions. Here's a different suggestion:  Pick up and listen to The Best Band You Never Heard In Your Life. This is a great live album with a rocking band and it covers a lot of stuff from Zappa's career.  Find tracks you like and go listen to the source albums.  That is how I originally discovered a lot of Zappa's music.
Zappa,3bo3s8,Jack_Shid,2,Wed Jul 1 17:37:19 2015 UTC,"Just a note to say you should check out Jeff Simmons' Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up, the 1970 album that features the original version of the title song, plus other gems.

The whole album is worth checking out if you're into Zappa's jazzy stuff as well as his classical.  I like to think of it as ""the real Hot Rats II"".  If you're looking more for instrumental stuff in Zappa's own albums that's dynamic and bombastic,  Sinister Footwear II is one of my favorites.  Or if you want something nice n' brassy, you can't go wrong with the title track from The Grand Wazoo."

Zappa,3beicq,choppadoo,2,Mon Jun 29 16:05:11 2015 UTC,"Mediocre is where you've gotta start. It's well known that the first movies you watch aren't the best ones. You gotta work your way up until you can appreciate the high-quality stuff. Mediocre albums are a great entry point because they're the easiest to digest while still being enjoyable without needing to have first developed an acquired taste.  My firsts were Joe's Garage and We're Only In It For The Money, but I don't outright disagree with the consensus that Apostrophe/Overnight Sensation are the best entry albums.  (Gotta admit, though. Not really a fan of Zoot Allures or Chunga's Revenge. I would call those albums subpar rather than mediocre. Wouldn't wanna have to sit through those before I'm allowed to hear One Size Fits All or Joe's Garage.)"

Zappa,3bdlid,RainbowInCurvedAir,2,Mon Jun 29 03:30:57 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it's underwhelming. The title track, ""Calculus"", and ""Rykoniki"" are the only tracks that stood out to me. ""Pachuco Gavotte"" reminded me of a solo from Guitar for some reason.  If Dance Me This had come out in 1994 we would have shrugged it off as so-so."

Zappa,3bdlid,RevNimshi,4,Sun Jun 28 20:37:50 2015 UTC,"I'm 99% sure they mean it's the last one FZ finished that's full of original material. I think the last thing FZ ever completed was The Rage And The Fury, but that was a Varese-tribute album. So that still needs to come out, along with the Roxy movie still, and then on top of all that I think Gail mentioned something about working on the ""next release"".   TL;DR: They're not stopping anytime soon"
Zappa,3bdlid,YCANTUSTFU,2,Sun Jun 28 21:17:50 2015 UTC,It's the last project he was actively working on. There's still plenty of gold in the vaults.

Zappa,3bdlid,l_Know_Where_U_Live,0,Sun Jun 28 16:18:47 2015 UTC,It's just wrong. It's not unfinished; it's music for a dance troupe; this is how it's supposed to sound.
Zappa,3bdlid,Wizard-in--Black,0,Mon Jun 29 20:29:35 2015 UTC,I only listened to it on YT but on first hearing I'm not too hot on it.  I think that's mainly down to the fact that I don't that much of his synclavier stuff though.

It's done by engaging the vocal chords at the lowest pitch possible while inhaling slowly and making an 'ooh' shape with your mouth.  It also helps to have a mic extremely close to or inside your mouth and to cup your hands over the mouth and mic, which you can see them doing in the video below."

Zappa,3auo5c,swagshoah,2,Tue Jun 23 17:28:32 2015 UTC,"I mostly do not like the '84 tour, but your many qualifiers have convinced me this might be worth it.  BTW one of the most interesting things I heard about the '84 band was that the reason why the sound of this band is way more trebly than previous incarnations was because Frank was suffering from high-end hearing loss. Couldn't hear treble as well anymore, so he had them turn it up. Scott Thunes said so on a podcast."
Zappa,3auo5c,Fatmanredemption,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"While some might disagree, I really do get a kick out of the 84 tour.  Some of the shows on that tour are really tight, even if they do have goofy bits.  This setlist in particular has some nice highlights when compared to other shows from this tour.  Thanks for posting this, well worth a listen."
Zappa,3auo5c,AngusOReily,1 point,Tue Jun 30 07:17:23 2015 UTC,"I've generally not big on the '84 tour, but Evil Prince, Ride My Face, Carol, and Chana justify the band's existence.  Pretty good show (the numerous Owner quotes are particularly appropriate given what just happened to Chris Squire), and Baby Take Your Teeth Out is a particularly rare treat."
Zappa,3aukg4,thatvillainromeo,4,Tue Jun 23 17:02:29 2015 UTC,"nothing circulates. it's not impossible that someone's hoarding a tape of this show, but seeing as there's no circulating tape from the other Helsinki shows of this period (other than the official releases of course) even that seems unlikely. You'd think a big city such as Helsinki would have people taping the gigs, but apparently no, and sadly, not a Dick Barber board tape either. I hope the multitracks still exist and are still playable and uncut. Now as for the extended part....it's Frank and the gang at their prime, but there are several obvious edits, the worst ones being:  RDNZL solo ending abruptly with an audible (to my sensitive ears) edit. Montana jam seguing into the ending part of Big Swifty. Now some people are not sure whether Big Swifty really was played as an outro, but when all circulating versions from this tour have it as a full-blown monster song, i think it's a safe bet that Frank edited it, in addition to the edit actually being, you know, audible by its sonic signature. Also, Florentine Pogen from these shows was partially released on YCDTOSA 4, but it edited into a 1979 version early which didn't have a solo. The 1974 part sounds better than YCDTOSA 2 though, but it still has that drum sound and processed overall sound. Satumaa was actually taken from an unplanned free third show at the same venue BTW. Enjoy the album for what it is for now though. And be sure to get some complete Fall 1974 shows from Zappateers. Most of them blow this release out of the water performance-wise. I'd recommend you get:  both Halloween 1974 shows (a great half-an-hour-long Dupree's Paradise, fantastic long Big Swifty, featuring Bruce Fowler, seguing into a very rare fantastic Apostrophe, great 12 minutes Pojama People, Penguin In Bondage, etc.)"

Zappa,3a3ikl,ausernameitis,12,Tue Jun 16 23:14:57 2015 UTC,"It was the fall 80 tour. FZ told me I was playing too much in one of his solos (Torture?), which I found annoying. He said he just wanted me to just play ""A"", and that's what I did, but in the most irritating, off rhythm way I could. When he played it for me later, he said, ""I don't know if you were pissed off at me or what, but you played really great on this track!"" Go figure."
Zappa,3a3ikl,swagshoah,3,Tue Jun 16 23:35:13 2015 UTC,"That's awesome, it sounds like it could have been one of his xenochrony tracks where he used to take separate parts of different songs and fit them together.  edit I figured out why I made that connection:  https://youtu.be/fE5ZAXQws7s?t=14m11s  One note baseline, all over the place sometimes.  ""Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear.  The solo was recorded over a completely different backing track.

Zappa,3a3ikl,Wizard-in--Black,11,Tue Jun 16 23:47:06 2015 UTC,"Here is the real version. Please ignore any chronologically impossible versions:  There was a moment during the rehearsals, a food break, probably, when I had a chance to try to run through it with Vinnie. When I asked him about it, he said that he had not yet had a chance to look at it, but would be happy to sight read through it. He had a plate of sushi which he opened up and started eating while he located the drum part. He got the chart set up on his music stand, lit up a cigarette and he started reading through it. Incredibly, he was able to play it almost flawlessly the first time through! I was floored. Scarfing sushi and smoking a butt while sight reading “Mo’s.” I couldn’t believe it."

Zappa,3a3ikl,YCANTUSTFU,5,Wed Jun 17 00:10:51 2015 UTC,"I learned from Moroder what it takes to make a hit song and how to produce. It was great to be working on all those songs and movies. Robby I have known since before FZ, and continue to work with him now. He is very humble and a great creative force. The Doors were one of my favorite bands."

Listening to an interview with Frank once upon a time, he credited your musical memory as being particularly impressive, which considering the complexity and breadth of the work is no small feat. Is that something you worked on specifically in your musical development, or is it the kind of thing you naturally tended to?  Thanks again!"
Zappa,3a3ikl,Sapling666,8,Wed Jun 17 02:01:51 2015 UTC,"Wow, where did Frank say that? I never heard it, but it's very flattering! Thanks, FZ! It comes naturally, but only if it is something I think is cool. In fact it is hard for me to remember stuff I don't care for, but if I dig it, it's almost impossible for me to NOT remember it!"

Seemed to me a particularly cool thing to be when it comes to Frank's music; at least I find the notion trememdously impressive. Anyways, thank you for the answer, and for the AMA, and for the beautiful music!  *And apologies for the delay, it took me a while to remember where I'd heard it!"
Zappa,3a3ikl,Misterpeople25,8,Wed Jun 17 07:13:45 2015 UTC,"Seriously, where did Frank say that?"
Zappa,3a4b3i,nonex,4,Wed Jun 17 03:04:27 2015 UTC,"This was the solo that convinced me to learn guitar (even though it's not one of Frank's best, it was more the tone that got to me).   And IIRC the joke was, it was a typically endless Zappa solo, and then it fades out. So you flip the record (or swap to the second disc, forgive me, it has been a couple of decades) and the fucking solo starts up again right where it left off!   Meta before meta."
Zappa,3a4b3i,CaerBannog,3,Wed Jun 17 04:39:57 2015 UTC,That's hilarious. I was trying to figure out why that vinyl rip goes right into again after the song fades out. That makes sense.

Zappa,3a4b3i,Aububuh,3,Wed Jun 17 03:08:32 2015 UTC,Sounds to me like this rip is missing one of the stereo channels and most of the bass.  Still better than the Ryko CD though.  Have you heard the 2012 CD remaster?  It sounds fantastic.  It has everything that's on the vinyl version.
Zappa,3a4b3i,beepboopblorp,3,Wed Jun 17 04:09:53 2015 UTC,I need to find that 2012 re-master. Was there ever an explanation as to why that original Ryko release was such a disaster?
Zappa,3a4b3i,Aububuh,3,Wed Jun 17 14:09:44 2015 UTC,"I think it was a combination of new, untested equipment, and, as Mike Keneally puts it, Frank being ""in too much pain to care that day"".  Spencer Chrislu remastered the album in 1998, and supposedly that version sounds good, but it's nearly impossible to identify a copy because it looks identical to the 1995 ""bad"" version."
Zappa,3a4b3i,beepboopblorp,3,Wed Jun 17 20:07:37 2015 UTC,The 2012 remaster is actually what made me enjoy this record for the first time. What an incredible mix.

They seemed to lament: ""Why didn't he do it properly? Why didn't he give a damn, so we could have much more amazing music instead of the crap he did? Why did he waste his extraordinary talents...""  I'm personally not dissapointed by Zappa at all - he created a truck load of amazing music (and, admittedly, some shite) - but I can understand where he's coming from. With great expectations come great dissapointment, I suppose. Perhaps they haven't really understood what Frank Zappa was about.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy it!

A specific album review should in this case be focussed on the fans, to explain the difference between this exact album and the others. Why this one is worse/better, what's different etc. The review that he made could be labelled on so many Zappa albums....

Zappa,39te12,lexgunner,4,Sun Jun 14 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"""Bongo Fury"" is hardly a masterpiece, though.  Even as a die-hard Zappa fan, this album is mediocre at best."
Zappa,39te12,AM_key_bumps,3,Sun Jun 14 20:41:25 2015 UTC,"IMO the combination of Beefhearts abstract poetry/vocals, Zappa compositions, instrumentals and vocals from both make this album unique. It's very diverse in a certain way. And of course the legendary Muffin Man ending."

Zappa,39jxu3,ChalkPie,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:35:55 2015 UTC,Petting Zoo is a pretty good starter compilation. I only got into the Residents about 5 years ago when I went to one of the Talking Light shows. Two of their best IMO is Commercial Album and Third Reich And Roll.

Zappa,39jxu3,bobo_skips,1 point,Fri Jun 12 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"I like them up to a point, probably around ""Eskimo"" or so.  After that, around the time two of the founders left, leaving only (Hardy and Homer? I think?), the music went from being extremely experimental to just kind of weird, relying on standard instrumentation and structure.  The truly interesting stuff (their first album especially) is what I really like about them.  At this point they're basically just boring art-rock to me, really.  More about the theatrics than the music."
Zappa,39jxu3,choppadoo,1 point,Fri Jun 12 10:40:01 2015 UTC,I was reading about them the other day. Is it true that nobody really knows who they are?  Also they have like 500 albums. Can you recommend the most accessible/listenable/musical? I listened to Swastikas on Parade or something and it sounded like an entire 40 minutes of the 10-second sound effect cuts Zappa used for fun.

The only trouble with the 79 band is that their setlists were very static and Zappa only toured for a few months in Europe that year. I would have loved to see what this particular band would have grown into if given more touring time and more of a chance to spread out and improvise together."

Zappa,38rq17,swagshoah,2,Sat Jun 6 06:15:34 2015 UTC,"For me, the highlight of this show (besides Frank's tasty solos, especially on Pick Me I'm Clean) was Arthur Barrow's ridiculous, Jaco-channeling bass playing during the Society Pages medley.  Of course, Logeman's mostly boring drumming kind of drags down a couple tracks (Easy Meat in particular) and makes me really pine for Terry, Vinnie, or Chad.  edit:  Also, if you're intrigued by this show and want to hear a better performance out of the Logeman band (albeit at a much lower sound quality), I would strongly suggest taking a listen to 6/22/80.  You basically get:   A much, much better, more inspired Easy Meat solo. Pound For A Brown, which is about as 'out there' as this band got. The number one reason IMO, numerous 'Cars' (Gary Numan) quotes and 'In France' secret word usage, including the improvised origin of the actual song 'In France' as a Cars parody during the spoken portion of Mudd Club.  There were a couple standalone performances later in the tour which had In France as a Cars parody which are also potentially worth seeking out, but if you want the origin, this is the one."

From what I heard, the lithuanian statue was originally meant to be somewhere else than in a corner of parking lot but apparently they ran out of money and had to make smaller statue and place it there.

Zappa,38gk2l,grouchyfrostgiant,4,Thu Jun 4 05:23:20 2015 UTC,"Funny enough, it's the same with Zappa's political humor. Happy satire at first, then it evolved into cynical anger towards the end."
Zappa,38gk2l,Iron_Sausage,3,Thu Jun 4 05:46:03 2015 UTC,"This is very true. Both eras for each artist definitely have their value.  With Carlin, it was always communication and social interaction he would poke fun at, in addition to wry observations of life.  Zappa did the same thing, only with great music."
Zappa,38gk2l,grouchyfrostgiant,3,Thu Jun 4 15:13:29 2015 UTC,"""Wonderful Wino"" has the same name as a Carlin bit. I don't know if it was Jeff Simmons or Frank who named the song.  The title looks like a coincidence because Carlin didn't release a recording of ""Wonderful WINO"" until a couple years after Lucille Has Messed My Mind Up came out, but in the '60s Carlin had a radio show in Redondo Beach and he worked up a lot of his later material there. ""WINO"" is definitely a radio bit.  So...maybe."

(they were neighbors) Connolly is basically the scottish Carlin. So there is a chance!  The only thing I could imagine Frank hating about George is that George was a clean cut comic in the begining, He eventually found the drug/hippy scene and we all know how Frank feels about that."

The stereo image is very different and the ""wrong"" version sounds what feels like 'darker'.  If I had to guess, the ""wrong"" version is the vinyl mix and the ""right"" version is one of the many CD remixes.  More info:  http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/apostrophe.html  edit:  Listened to the version on spotify and comparing with the info at the link I posted, I'm pretty sure that the version on spotify is the vinyl mix."

I now see:   Also as stated elsewhere, ""Excentrifugal Forz"" is mixed a bit differently on the CD. This is most obvious during the instrumental introduction, which features a less prominent violin and a more prominent guitar melody.   I guess I've been listening to the CD remix all these year.    Deeper analysis of the difference between versions of apostrophe and overnight can be found here: http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/misc/quad.html"
Zappa,38ds6x,outerspaceways,2,Wed Jun 3 19:58:01 2015 UTC,Zappa nailed it most of the time but sometimes he got it wrong. Example would be the 1986 version of We're only in it for the money.
Zappa,38ds6x,swagshoah,3,Wed Jun 3 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Further on the topic of remixes/rereleases, don't forget the Thana Harris vocals on Sleep Dirt.  And the Ruben and the Jets remix.  The penalty tracks on Uncle Meat.  The insane amount of digital reverb (Chunga, Sheik Yerbouti, Uncle Meat, many others).  Removing Willie The Pimp Part 2 from Fillmore East (though I do understand why that was done).  Cutting out part of I'm So Cute from SY.  Really, I think that FZ's studio remixes being favourable is the exception rather than the rule.  I think there were really only 2-3 remasters that Frank himself did right, as most of the later good ones (1998 YAWYI and Tinseltown Rebellion in particular) were mostly different engineers unfucking what Frank screwed up:   Hot Rats.  People might be mixed about this, but I find both the '86 remix and the vinyl release to be equally awesome, and the remix does correct some of the annoyances I had with the vinyl (namely, making the winds during Little Umbrellas more prominent and normalizing the volume on the winds on Green Genes).  The Willie solo edit is really more of a personal preference thing. The extra 3 minutes added to the beginning of Weasels Ripped My Flesh make the first track flow better and gives you a bit more insight into the bizarre side of the early Mothers. Apostrophe generally sounds better, though I don't think there were any musical changes unlike the latter two."
Zappa,38ds6x,fzforme,3,Wed Jun 3 20:31:19 2015 UTC,"So sue me, I liked the vocal takes on Sleep Dirt and the Money/Ruben/Lumpy Gravy remixes. As much as people hate them, I think they've held up a lot more over time than any of the pre-2012 remasters."
Zappa,38ds6x,RainbowInCurvedAir,2,Wed Jun 3 21:00:19 2015 UTC,"The ""wrong"" version is actually the right version, according to my original vinyl. Zappa took a few liberties when he released the CD's, and in some cases, depending on the countless reissues, they are different. I prefer the ""wrong"" version, but then again, that is what I grew up on. As for WOIIFTM, his original CD release had a lot of weird dubs not on the original vinyl. He got so much shit for it that he eventually re-released it verbatim to the vinyl. It's all fun either way as Frank always toyed with his tracks. As long as we still have the originals."

Zappa,386pwk,swagshoah,4,Tue Jun 2 06:26:42 2015 UTC,"IMO Frank was never about bringing on huge names.  He consistently brought up new talent and infused it around the core of old bands.  Saying, ""Just have Phish"" would never have flown for him (previous drug-related issues aside)    On Guitar, Tim Palmieri... honestly, it isn't even a choice.  On 'El Shankar', Allie Krahl.  She's primarily known as a bluegrass fiddler, but anyone who's ever seen her knows she can bring it to any situation.  On keys, Hiromi Motherfucking Uehara  On bass, Chris Loftlin. Ignore the medicore-ness of Krasno, because who cares, but Loftlin jumping around with joy in the background would fit right in.  On Drums, honestly probably Joe Russo.  Whenever I think of young drummers worth their salt, and doing interesting things his is the first name that pops into my head.  The one exception to my rule is that John Zorn would 150% be there on woodwinds, game pieces and general insanity.  Frank would either hate it, or it would be the best thing ever.  He's not that famous anyways  Depending on what Frank wanted, I'd get some of the horn section from Snarky Puppy to come hang out for a few songs  On Vibraphones, Ed Mann.  He's still around, he's still great.  I'm actually seeing him tonight   I would hang out and do occasional vocals... that's about the only thing I'm good at.  I can nail pretty much the entirety of Studabaker Hoch lines at this point  As to what we would play, it would be about 40% material based on the '78 tour (this band would shine there), 20% early Mothers jams (you can bet your ass there would be a King Kong and Sleeping in a Jar suite), and 40% Roxy / JLP era type stuff    I would come out for at least one silly doo-wop song a night  It would be heaven"

Ray White on lead vocals and rhythm guitar.  He's still got it!  And since this is fantasy time, myself on keyboards and vocals.  As for the repertoire, I would do the most balls-to-the-wall ROCK show any Zappa band has ever played.  Imagine a show that goes something like this.  Set 1: Filthy Habits, Tell Me You Love Me, Hungry Freaks, T'Mershi Duween, Zomby Woof (w/ Guthrie solo), What's New in Baltimore, Moggio, Ain't Got No Heart, Florentine Pogen, Easy Meat, Yo Mama   Set 2: The Black Page [Metal Version], Bamboozled By Love, Echidna's Arf, Sinister Footwear II, Big Swifty (monster song: everybody solos), City of Tiny Lites, Drowning Witch  Encore: Gas Station,  Sharleena, Andy"

The Zappa Family Trust, while known for fucking things up from time to time, has nailed down the vinyl reissue game.   Their recent remasters of Freak Out, Roxy & Elsewhere, Uncle Meat, Overnite Sensation, have all been spectacularly good releases. Excellent mastering, high quality German vinyl, and wonderful packaging with nice poly lined inner sleeves.  I'm really looking forward to this new release. I'm sure the recording is pristine, and was recorded in one of the world's best sounding rooms, and was conducted by a master. This is going to be very special, audiophile quality, modern classical music. I'm stoked.   And we hope to see you at the Movies!   Yeah, they've tricked me with that one before..."

Zappa,37ow80,swagshoah,6,Fri May 29 06:19:56 2015 UTC,"Elvis Has Just Left The Building - Not my favourite of the '88 originals but a solid intro cut and certainly pleasant to listen to.  Planet of the Baritone Women - Probably the best of the 'short form' '88 originals.  I like the overdramatic nature of it, and it fits really well with the band.  I'm not sure any previous FZ band would have done it justice.  Any Kind of Pain - The '88 band does a good job with this one, and I'm glad that FZ brought it back for this group.  Unfortunately, the solo, like a lot of FZ's '88 solos, is not all that great (though it does have its moments).  Dickie's Such an Asshole - '88 does this track okay, but I much prefer the rawer, looser Roxy-era version with Napi on vocals.  When the Lie's So Big - Meh.  Rhymin' Man - The only thing that really redeems this song is the extensive musical quoting, and it bears picking apart and reading the lyrics along the way.  Not one that I can listen to often, but I'm glad it exists.  Promiscuous - This is hands-down the worst song in FZ's officially released catalog, but whether it's the worst song in the entire FZ canon is up for debate (Swallow My Pride is certainly under consideration for the title).  There's a good reason this was performed all of once ever.  The Untouchables - I like this number, Ike monologue included.  Why Don't You Like Me? - Not really big on this rework.  Bacon Fat - I really enjoy this song and I think the '88 band did it way better than the early Mothers.  Stolen Moments - I have a particular attachment to this song because I used to play it in my high school jazz combo, though it is a bit weird to hear the band do a 'straight ahead' jazz tune like this.  My only gripe with the released version is that I've heard that other performances on this tour have had much bigger solo sections, and while the abridged version works well on this record with the transition into Murder By Numbers, I really want to hear some of the other, longer performances.  Murder By Numbers - This track, combined with the previous two, is the disc's highlight for me.  Everyone just sounds like they're having a ball, and hearing Sting put down Jimmy Swaggart is always a great time.  It's too bad, however, that it has to be followed by...  Jezebel Boy - What a turd.  Outside Now - I haven't heard too many live versions of this tune, but FZ manages to whip out a pretty solid solo on this one, especially for '88.  Hot Plate Heaven at the Green Hotel - I like the energy that the horn section brings to the song, but I really am not a fan of the 'stop the world and play a totally different solo vamp' sort of performances because it totally ruins the energy of the song, though this wasn't unique to '88 or this song.  What Kind of Girl? - Yuck.  FZ should have left it in the vault after Flo & Eddie departed.  Jesus Thinks You're A Jerk - Among the better of the '88 originals for sure, but not something I listen to much because this is one of my least listened FZ discs.  Overall, I agree with /u/swagshoah's review, but I definitely disagree on a couple particular tracks.  As an unintentional period piece, it works, but as far as a FZ record, it's definitely one of the ones I play the least.  It also really makes me want yet another '88 disc - we still have no official releases of Packard Goose (which puts the classical interludes on MAJNH in proper context), Uncle Remus, Peaches En Regalia, any of the Beatles tunes, or Marque-son's Chicken (aside from the solo on Trance Fusion), though maybe it's few enough tracks that we could do with a YCDTOSA style release."

Zappa,37ow80,drummaman1,3,Sat May 30 00:27:18 2015 UTC,"I have an interesting note about Promiscuous.  I've talked with a friend about this song, and he sees it as evidence that Frank was losing touch with contemporary music, whereas I see it as more of a takeoff on the lame attempts at rap that certain people were making around that time.  Neither of those points of view shed light on Frank however, as Scott Thunes lays claim to the composition of the musical portion of the song.    I don't think it's much to listen to, but it's not really trying to be.  It's just a silly little groove and some now-outdated satire."
Zappa,37ow80,Aububuh,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:43:38 2015 UTC,"I'm definitely in your friend's camp; 'Promiscuous' is an embarrassment,(musically, anyways) IMO.

After that it's a book fulla rants, but it's fine nonetheless. I liked the part where he talks about musicians cheating their way into making you think they did a good solo by just working up to the highest note, sustaining that, and then ending. Go read it at your local library."

This was shortly after Franks death.  I saw a regular from my bar at the one I was having a date at.  My date and he were the only three in the bar, and he told the bartender he was buying all the drinks, because he just got a major settlement from a record company.  He was picking up the tab before he even noticed the book I had laid on the bar.  http://idiotbastard.com/Interviews/DennyWalley.htm  I had no idea who he was, despite having drank with him numerous times. http://wiki.killuglyradio.com/wiki/Denny_Walley"

Zappa,37e6jn,kbslasher88,1 point,Fri May 29 23:23:03 2015 UTC,"I loved it and enjoyed it both times I read it. What makes it the ultimate Frank Zappa book is like someone else mentioned you truly read it in his voice. I have read a few great music autobiographies that feel like they are narrating, but none feels as authentic for having a conversation with the man/lady then this one, its like sitting down and hearing him rant, it's lovely. Also that being said, I think the organization is actually poor, though this is not an issue for enjoyment purposes. He starts' out like its going to be a chronological tale, with his youth and the early mothers, then just throws that idea away and has chapters on whatever he wants."

He starts' out like its going to be a chronological tale, with his youth and the early mothers, then just throws that idea away and has chapters on whatever he wants.   If I recall correctly, Zappa very much disapproved of the manuscript as it was completed by coauthor David Occhiogrosso, so he sat down and reassembled it himself - adding, subtracting, and editing various things. This may have contributed to its organizational disjunction."

I laughed all the way through the book and came to admire him and his quirks even more by the end.   I went to college for music so the part where he describes the personalities of particular instrumentalists (violinists, flutists, bassists, etc) was spot on and very funny."
Zappa,37e6jn,nikkiten,1 point,Wed May 27 21:59:18 2015 UTC,"The book is phenomenal.  It is simply FZ telling the FZ story.

Zappa,3765d4,YCANTUSTFU,2,Mon May 25 20:36:35 2015 UTC,"I've seen one of these! A record-seller I know picked one up record-hunting in Thailand. As to why Frank is on the cover but the record doesn't contain his music, he explained it to me this way:    Back then, music bootleggers in Asia would just slap any old image on the front of a record because, although people were eager to hear the new sounds coming out of the West, they wouldn't have recognized who was on the cover. The bootleggers just wanted to put something cool and 'American-looking' on the front and didn't see any need to use images that represented the actual music on the record or the artists that created it. As to why someone chose this particular FZ cartoon, we'll never know. I guess people just thought his image was appealing.  This also explains the several other examples of 'no Zappa material on this record' found here."

I saw it in the early 80s when it happened and am struck by how prescient (I'm always struck by how prescient he is) about the ""conservative"" movement. Broadway the Hard Way was a warning to the world about religious fanatics taking over the White House. He was 12 years early, but it did happen and today, after 19 years of Faux News we have people thinking this kind of bullshit lying and minding others' business is fucking normal.   I miss Frank. A lot. It's a shame that the only person in the public eye who comes close to his social commentary about politics and lying is John Stewart.

Captain Beefheart and George Duke were also there, so it must have been during the tour with Beefheart. He talks about music and education and other things in more detail than the shorter TV interviews which focus on his image and persona. There's also lots of audience questions.

Well, that's true if you're only looking for something new - it really doesn't offer a very different version of anything that you didn't hear on FZ:OZ, but unless you really hate NMB's oversinging I find it at worst innocuous.  The only thing imo that can be easily skipped is the Poodle Lecture which is easily the worst thing about any show it appears in.  At least he knows to get it out of the way early so it doesn't ruin my enjoyment of the rest of the recording when it pops up.  In any case, this show absolutely rips.  Napkins and Chunga are completely amazing.  Filthy Habits is a nice treat but I prefer it slower and meaner, and I love San Ber'dino as a show closer."

Zappa,3695li,EnigmaticLemons,16,Sun May 17 11:30:55 2015 UTC,"I kind of get what you mean, but I don't think it applies. I'm sure he did share the stage with some famous names, but as far as his own music, it was just unnecessary.   Frank didn't ""collaborate"" with Vai. Vai was just part of his band. His band was a collection of hardcore musicians who had to be able to perform crazy parts on command. The best of the best. Nothing else was needed. Plus Im sure Frank wouldn't work with someone famous just to promote his own name."
Zappa,3695li,FloydRosita,6,Sun May 17 12:53:17 2015 UTC,I would argue that he didn't collaborate with Beef either.
Zappa,3695li,FormerCyclopse,4,Sun May 17 16:54:39 2015 UTC,"Aside from a couple Beefheart  lyric contributions, Bongo Fury is strictly a Zappa album."
Zappa,3695li,anonymous_rhombus,12,Sun May 17 18:25:12 2015 UTC,"Musically, Frank was such an individual artist that it just didn't work to truly collaborate.  Case in point is the show with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, which you'd think could be great, but it amounted to the Mothers performing their actual songs with Yoko Ono wailing over the top.  Another example would be Mister Sting performing ""Murder by Numbers"" with the 1988 band -- Sting couldn't honestly contribute anything musically to Frank's band, so it was just a cover with a guest singer.  I'd think if Frank collaborated with an established jazz artist like you mentioned, something would be compromised on either side -- like if Frank's band played with Miles Davis, Miles would be the bandleader, and without Frank ""in charge"" the band would be something less than it usually was, or vice versa.  I think the only example of something that worked was Zappa at the Nova Convention, 1978, with William Burroughs.  Zappa working with artists from different media (other than music) had a lot of potential."
Zappa,3695li,zakktravis,3,Sun May 17 13:09:19 2015 UTC,"He didn't have positive feedback about his colab with John and Yoko. I heard this interview where he says he didn't like her attitude and stuff, and the straw broke the camel's back was the fact that they wanted to rename ""King Kong"" to something like ""John's Jam"" or something.   I love ""Murder by numbers"", Sting coming in all big band style. I love YCDTOSA 5 Disc 2."
Zappa,3695li,fumblebuck,3,Mon May 18 06:32:07 2015 UTC,"It wasn't that they just wanted to rename a track, it was a dispute over songwriting credits (Jamrag, a King Kong extract, among them)."
Zappa,3695li,outerspaceways,2,Mon May 18 16:56:51 2015 UTC,"I've heard ""Baby please don't go"" and another track from that recording. It's okay, FZ is just there for a solo, the rest is standard rock fair. Perhaps that's why he wasn't into collaborations; the music everyone else made was way too simple."
Zappa,3695li,fumblebuck,5,Mon May 18 17:08:16 2015 UTC,Zappa jammed with Pink Floyd in 1969. Little known fact.
Zappa,3695li,thismoonlife,8,Fri May 22 05:22:53 2015 UTC,"Zappa co-wrote quite a few songs with other artists, but the main reason he didn't successfully collaborate on large projects was ego and his world-view.  He gives it away in his autobiography. 'There are no friends in the music business', or however he put it (I forget if he said the music business or show business.) This is an incredibly negative viewpoint. Cynical to the max. It may be a wise view from the business angle, but not a healthy view psychologically.   We all love the music, but we also all secretly know that Frank Zappa was a very insular, self-protective individual. A lot of horrible life experiences led him up to that, but it was also a choice. He was psychologically unable to collaborate with others, unless, perhaps, he had the upper hand creatively and in a business sense."
Zappa,3695li,CaerBannog,4,Sun May 17 14:09:40 2015 UTC,but not a healthy view psychologically.    Realism is always healthy.
Zappa,3695li,FormerCyclopse,3,Sun May 17 16:55:22 2015 UTC,"He did do some as others have mentioned but I get the impression that he cared most about having the freedom of full artistic control, which maybe would have made him feel compromised if he tried to collaborate on the songwriting/""band-leading"" side of things?  I suspect that he was kind of a control freak as well haha.  In the collaborations he did do, it seems like there were always very clearly delineated roles for him and his collaborators (like, ""you'll be a guest singer on this track I wrote,"" or ""I'll record a guitar solo for this song of yours"")."

Zappa,3695li,GRIZx,7,Sun May 17 14:55:26 2015 UTC,Doing backing vocals or appearing in a movie isn't really what i would consider a collaboration.

Zappa,35ra8j,DarylHannahMontana,9,Wed May 13 21:05:50 2015 UTC,"I saw an interview on youtube where he mentioned enjoying  Tom Tom Club's Genius of Love, citing their music video as his favorite.     It amazes me to think that Frank enjoyed do-wop and other garbage pop music so much.  He comes across so elitist at times with the ""I only listen to classical music"" quotes.  Admit it Zappa, at the end of a long day you just want to listen to stupid-simple Muddy Waters and you know it."

I heard that thing and I was jumping all over the car. And then when I heard the one after that, Like a Rolling Stone, I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: ""If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else,"" but it didn't do anything. It sold; but nobody responded to it the way that they should have. They should have listened to that and said, ""Hey, that record got on the radio. Now, wait a minute, we've got a chance to say something, you know? The radio is for us to use as a weapon."" It didn't happen right away, and I was a little disappointed. I figured, ""Well, shit, maybe it needs a little reinforcing.""   Source: http://www.afka.net/Articles/1967-09_Jazz_Pop.htm  There was a time when Frank actually cared about social justice and felt that a change was possible. Holy shit.

Zappa,35ra8j,mocthezuma,5,Wed May 13 10:21:01 2015 UTC,"I know what got Frank loved the song ""3 hours past midnight"" by Johnny Guitar Watson apparently he used to go into this diner in high school and play that record in the juke box over and over.  I think in terms of like the Grateful Dead, he said that those kind of hippie's that came along with that scene came after the ""freak"" scene started in LA and that a lot of people give hippies credit for the movement in the 60s to them when in reality it was the original ""freaks"". This is kind of where Franks anti-establishment attitude came from too I believe, because the police used to just drive up and down the street arresting ""freaks"" in the LA area.  I don't think he was big on jam band kind of music or liked hippies very much, but i've never heard him flat out say he hated the Grateful Dead or whatever. I do know i've heard him say in an interview that he thought the beatles and the stones were just, ""okay"" he said that with a kind of quirky smile from the interview I watched.   I think for the most part from what I gather, (this is my view and i'm just a big fan and no expert) he was more into orchestra music and jazz than probably classic rock or jam band music. I also would say since he was such a meticulous composer and kinda OCD when it came to his band, he probably wasn't a huge fan of long un-composed improvised jams that the dead were famous for.   A lot of members the the grateful dead and phish have sighted him as a big influence. I know Phish used to play Peaches n' Regalia pretty frequently."

Zappa,35ra8j,beepboopblorp,2,Wed May 13 18:54:31 2015 UTC,"I know of his interest in Black Sabbath, which is mentioned in both Ozzy and Tony Iommi's autobiographies. I was always curious if he met the Grateful Dead or Yes, but I don't think he was that interested in them. I have heard him mention in some late 70's interviews when asked about new wave, that he thought some of that stuff was interesting but i doubt he went out and bought any Talking Heads LP's.  I definitely think for a while he did not dislike the prog rock that was coming out, but maybe he was a little irked Pink Floyd and Yes were getting huge amounts of radio airplay leading to a huge level of stadium fame, while his music was never given the same time of respect or distribution."
Zappa,35ra8j,abeafzal,2,Wed May 13 15:17:31 2015 UTC,"I also want to mention what people think of the song ""We're Turning Again."" Though I have always taken it has his way of still attacking the ""flower-power"" hippies I actually think he is reminiscing that its worse now (the 80's) Basing this on ""All those assholes really need you."" Also considering he covered not one but a few Beatles songs on his 88' tour. I think though he may have thought they received a huge amount of fame for using  technical studio mechanics in the late 60's he was already mastering. I think he really warmed up to the Beatles by the end of his life. Considering what he may have thought in 66' compared to all the musical shit and MTV of the 80's."
Zappa,35ra8j,abeafzal,4,Wed May 13 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"Though I have always taken it has his way of still attacking the ""flower-power"" hippies I actually think he is reminiscing that its worse now (the 80's) Basing this on ""All those assholes really need you.""   From Sheik Yerbouti onward, Frank engaged in a sort of satire where he would attack both sides, showing that he perhaps supported neither or was fully aware of the problems on the side he did support.  It's like Bobby Brown which satirized both radical feminism and the all-American machismo the movement was trying to change. You come away from the song not knowing if Frank was a homophobic misogynist who feared feminism would end up emasculating the American male, or if he was totally down with the Women's Lib movement because the American male was a greedy conceited rapist who deserved his comeuppance. All you do know is that he clearly hated a great majority of both those groups.  So ""We're Turning Again"" sounds to me like Frank saying, ""God do I hate hippies. Yes, I haven't changed my mind on them. And look at how pathetically they've aged! And the way they've dominated the media so they can deify their dead stupid junkie rock gods that remind them of a time before their minds and bodies were damaged by their ravenous consumption of cocaine and LSD.""  ""sigh... Even so, that nascent period in pop-music history was a little better than what we have in the 80s, now that record execs have become more conservative and afraid to deviate from their formulaic norm."""
Zappa,35ra8j,Fatmanredemption,2,Wed May 13 18:40:25 2015 UTC,"Yea, I think you're right, but i still think his opinion of the music of many artists he may have trashed when they were contemporaries in the sixties changed with age the way most peoples musical tastes did.

Zappa,35q2gj,choppadoo,4,Tue May 12 16:19:12 2015 UTC,"The reason Frank released BtB when he did was that unscrupulous people (generally, skeevy european ""record labels"") had gotten copies (often several generations removed from the master) of various SBDs of FZ shows... which they then began cutting and releasing vinyl records of.    So Frank's response was literally to beat them to the punch, and released versions of the shows so that he could make some money at it.  Unfortunately, he wasn't directly involved in their production and the sound quality on most is fairly poor.  They are interesting as a historical artifact.  Typically there is a good (if not better) source of the same material on Zappateers, and further these shows are by no means a curated selection of excellent shows.  There are definitely highlights (most of which you noticed, except I'd add Swiss Cheese / Fire!), but  I would recommend our own Weekly Listening Sessions, or the Zappateers version which we were most definitely inspired by.

Zappa responded by playing a southern rock version of his song ""Montana"", subtitled ""Whipping Floss"". (This incident was eventually captured on his You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 2 live album, released in 1988.) In 1981, Zappa's band learned ""Whipping Post"" and added it to their repertoire, since the band's new singer and keyboard player Bobby Martin knew the song and sang the lead vocals on it."

Zappa,35ldfr,RondoHatton,2,Mon May 11 20:26:51 2015 UTC,"I think this album is chock full of some of the most incredible music ever put to tape, but I can hardly stand to listen to it.  Why?  It's that damn kick drum sound.  It sounds like somebody drumming their fingers on a plastic cup, and it's way more audible than every other instrument.  It doesn't help knowing how they did it either, even though it is kinda interesting.  Here's UMRK house engineer Mark Pinske talking about it.   Mix: There seems to be some reference in the newsgroups to the possibility that the kick drum on the Helsinki concerts was kind of sampled in or something.  Pinske: It was. It's called a Disco Boombox. It was made by dbx. It's a little thing called Disco Boombox. That's what the name of it was. You could spit into it and a kick drum would come out.[Laughs.] You could basically send anything you wanted into it and a kick drum would come out. We did do some triggering with Synclavier and some stuff like that, try to do that. It kind of got a little bit overdone in some ways. Butwe did manufacture drums out of--what I did was, I would take the original drums on the Helsinki stuff--I sectioned off what was originally just a stereo pair, and then I would take a graphic equalizer, for instance, and find the snare. And EQ everything else out. And then we would use that ridiculously sounding EQ that would spit every time the snare played, and I would externally trigger, using a gate and an external trigger, we'd externally trigger maybe a sample of a good snare that we recorded in the studio. And we tried to make it sound a little bit more real. Because a lot of them sounded just horrible. A lot of them didn't have any drums on at all. They were just a ring-y room. And we tried to give them some definition. And it was real easy sometimes to get a little bit too carried away, and get the proportions a little too up front, or too far back."

Reed thought FZ was getting label support he wasn't, while FZ thought Reed was full of shit and mocked him during the Money sessions. Both probably were right, on some level.  Over the years they sniped at each other in print but after FZ died, Reed reached out and made amends with Gail and the Zappa family, who had him give the Rock Hall of Fame speech when FZ was inducted.   And the thing is they had a lot in common: a love of 50s doo-wop, an interest in avant-garde composers (John Cage comes to mind) and both were pretty killer guitar players."

A notation on there about when Frank was telling the audience about--I think it was August in '84, when he was telling the audience about what the song was about. He was giving them the story. It was kind of funny. He explains that the song was about Mark Pinske in there. I found that kind of funny.   Mix: It's about a girl who wants to follow the band to the next gig, and Frank sings, ""You'll find another engineer?""  Pinske: Yeah. ""You'll find another engineer someday."" Actually, the girl named Carrie Mellon in Pittsburg. Carol Mellon was her name, and Frank introduced me to her--actually, we were at this hotel in Pittsburgh, and Frank called me down to have a drink with him, and I went down there and he was talking to the manager. So we couldn't go up to Frank's suite because the manager working the hotel couldn't go there, so he asked the girl if there might be somebody that she knew that we could just go out and have a drink with her, have a date with, you know. So she called up Carrie and said, ""Oh, yeah, Frank Zappa and me and his sound man are coming over to pick you up,"" and Carrie just said, ""Oh, yeah, sure, right. Frank Zappa, right."" So we pulled up in front of her house with a limo. [Laughing.] Which was pretty funny. And we just went out and did a few things, and then Frank kind of wrote a song about this girl. [Laughs.] And the events that happened that night. Later on, she bought me a cashmere sweater. And she wanted to steal some money from this Mexican guy. She got to be kind of a little problem, later. Nonetheless--I realized then for the first time in my life that a lot of Frank's songs were actually true stories about--  ......  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?p=120473  Anyway I just wanted to say that Carrie Mellon was really a sweet girl and not as “out there” as the song made her seem. There is much more to that story. Frank and I stayed at the other girl’s apartment and Carrie and I were out on the couch. I remember thinking that it seemed weird to be in a very cat odor apartment when Frank had a $2000 suite going to waste back at the hotel. It was the first time for Carrie and I didn’t know that till much later which explains why it started heading to a more clinging relationship.  Her father was with the Mellon bank center of Pittsburgh. And Carrie and her friend did come to another show about a week later. That is when Frank started with some funny lyrics about the whole incident. Yes, she did send me a cashmere sweater months later and she did joke about ways to raise money including this one Mexican guy who came into the bank. Frank did get a kick out of playing on what he called “young love” wasted on an engineer and wrote about it."

Zappa,353hx2,LordOfDemise,2,Wed May 6 23:41:04 2015 UTC,I'm seeing them this Friday. I'm excited.

Zappa,353hx2,Pieslasher,2,Thu May 7 11:50:58 2015 UTC,At their performance at the Keswick Theatre my Dad asked the drummer if they are given sheet music of the songs and the drummer said no. That just shows how talented they are.

Zappa,34ph6r,xylomorph,1 point,Sun May 3 10:48:25 2015 UTC,This has always been one of my favourite FZ pieces and I wasn't aware that ANY live performances of it existed. Too bad it's not the real thing but nice find nonetheless!
Zappa,34ph6r,Ionisation,0,Sun May 3 17:52:56 2015 UTC,"That one guitar and the synths sound sooooo bad. How did the synths from 1972 sound less dated than this?  You guys seriously don't hear it? How much those things just scream ""it's the early 90s, this is the newest tech, and we don't know any better yet!"""
Zappa,34ph6r,RainbowInCurvedAir,0,Sun May 3 17:25:13 2015 UTC,I had never cared for much of this particular program.  This Waka Jawaka is really pretty good.  Too bad Frank was sick and couldn't be there.
Zappa,34kjlv,mathrowaweigh,8,Fri May 1 23:22:56 2015 UTC,"What've you been listening to?   I've found that his canon runs the gamut from easy peasy pop, to funky fusion, to I don't know what the fuck is going on here.  It could be that you need to slip into the shallow end of the pool before trying to do a triple dipple horshat off the high dive into the deep end..."

Zappa,34kjlv,AlwaysSayHi,2,Sat May 2 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"Zappa's music is just music. It's ok if you don't get it, or like it, or listen to it.  It's cool if you do, though. What to you find yourself not getting? What are you listening to?"
Zappa,34kjlv,zck,1 point,Sat May 2 15:51:25 2015 UTC,"Well, it's more his guitar solos. No one could call him a virtuoso, but I still can't recreate what he does."
Zappa,34kjlv,zck,1 point,Sun May 3 16:30:22 2015 UTC,"Are you looking to play them, and having trouble technically playing it? Or the tone? You might want to post again, but explain that. Your post didn't get much traction because it's hard to know what you meant from it."
Zappa,34karv,ausernameitis,7,Fri May 1 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"To learn of an intense dislike between Zappa and Warhol is unsurprising. Warhol seems to be exactly the kind of self-important, pretentious hipshit Zappa lampoons in songs like those found all over We're Only In It For The Money. Warhol was surely intelligent enough to know that he and his ilk were exactly the type Frank was singing about."
Zappa,34karv,SmooveTaste,4,Sat May 2 20:11:44 2015 UTC,"Did some people really dislike Frank?  Sure.  The only things I have ever heard about him from others is that he was pretty cool, but he didn't suffer fools...like Andy Warhol.  As far as Lou Reed goes, every one of his songs sounds like he's getting dopesick."
Zappa,34karv,disco_gravy,16,Sat May 2 20:15:06 2015 UTC,"Zappa was a masterful guitarist. Zappa was a musical genius. Zappa was an amazing critical thinker and social commentator. Zappa was one of the great iconoclasts of the 20th century.   Zappa was a total dickhead to a lot of people. The people around him seem to have adored him, but he could be incredibly rude or unfeeling toward anyone he had no use for. My totally unqualified guess is that Frank had some sort of (obviously highly functional) autism-spectrum related thing going on."
Zappa,34karv,xanax_anaxa,9,Fri May 1 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"I personally doubt the autism-spectrum idea entirely. I've known a few people on that spectrum, and Zappa doesn't seem anything like them. I think Zappa was simply a dickhead a lot of the time. That doesn't make his music any less brilliant. I find no contradiction between loving his music and acknowledging that he was often a crummy person. There's no need to apologize for Zappa."
Zappa,34karv,SinisterMinisterX,3,Sat May 2 14:33:15 2015 UTC,"I can't find a link or any other source to back this up, but I once heard an interview with Tommy Mars in which one of the things discussed was Steve Vai's early days with the band.  According to Mars, there was an episode that went something like this: Vai was having a hard time nailing down some particular piece. After a few failed repetitions, Frank said very matter-of-factly to Vai something like, ""I don't understand why you're having this much trouble. I couldn't possibly take you on the road."" According to Mars, Vai was utterly crushed, and in tears.  Mars went to Frank privately and said something along the lines of, ""that was really harsh, he just wants to make you happy"".  Frank was completely dumfounded and seemed truly baffled that what he said could have hurt Steve's feelings.  I may be remembering it wrong, and Mars might have been recalling it wrong, so there's that."

Zappa,34karv,SinisterMinisterX,5,Thu May 7 22:01:35 2015 UTC,"I personally doubt the autism-spectrum idea entirely.   Oh, I think there is plenty of room for doubt. I only suspect it because it seemed to be a pattern that is hard to explain unless, as you say, he was simply a dick. But ""being a dick"" is often really just misjudging social cues and clues. A pattern of misjudging social cues combined with an almost monomaniacal obsession with something is often autism-spectrum related.    apologize for Zappa.   I was not intending that. I've had several friends with Asperger syndrome and they manage to not be dicks most of the time. But then again they've always had people to rein them in."
Zappa,34karv,xanax_anaxa,4,Sat May 2 14:57:00 2015 UTC,"[a behaviour of Zappa's] is often really just misjudging social cues and clues.   OTOH, he was also extremely charismatic. I mean, he wasn't even famous yet at the time that he got Tina Turner to sing those parts."

Zappa,34karv,Lurcho,7,Sat May 2 02:50:04 2015 UTC,Jazz music is full of Rain Men.
Zappa,34karv,bluelightsdick,-2,Sat May 2 08:41:03 2015 UTC,"...  Who upvotes this shit? You can be a male-brained nerd without being autistic, you know.  Also:   he could be incredibly [...] unfeeling toward anyone he had no use for.   There is nothing wrong with this. People aren't entitled to feels.   rude   Well, I'll give you that...  But there's no need to pathologise someone just for not being a pansy."
Zappa,34karv,smorrow,2,Sat May 2 22:32:04 2015 UTC,"To me, it seems like Zappa felt he didn't necessarily have to show respect to anyone unless they could prove they deserved it. Oh well. Thom Yorke and Bill Murray are remembered as geniuses but they had problems of their own (Yorke is the same as Zappa and Murray apparently beat his wife)."

Dweezil's band is, frankly, way out of Dweezil's musical league, but he is a great presence. I overheard a guy saying, on the way out the door, ""We just saw the best possible Zappa tribute band."" I think that is perfectly accurate; it's an earnest tribute to the man, and worthy of his spirit and music. I have my fingers crossed that Joe's Garage is next on the menu."

Zappa,34c40y,bubbafloyd,3,Thu Apr 30 01:10:27 2015 UTC,Wow.   They are WAYYYY better than the older videos I watched a couple years ago.   They are more of a unit now and seem to be having more fun.   The earlier stuff seemed very stiff and obsessed with holding Franks music as a precious gift with too much reverence.      They just played Magic Fingers!  Even had fun playing the Flo and Eddie parts.   I'm convinced.   Last time they were in town I watched old tapes and thought nah....    Next time I'm there.
Zappa,34c40y,Aububuh,3,Thu Apr 30 03:01:19 2015 UTC,"Dweezil has put together a very talented group of multi-instumentalists, and they put on a respectable show.  One Size Fits All was one of the first LPs I purchased a million years ago, and they did it justice.  Both Sofas (Sofae?) were solid.  Never thought I'd see Evelyn A Modified Dog performed live.  My kids sang along. Forty years since that album came out.  The audience looked like an AARP convention.    I had a chance to see FZ in Dallas in November '84.  I chose to do something else instead, thinking I would catch him next time around.  That ranks up there with things I really regret."
Zappa,34c40y,bubbafloyd,2,Thu Apr 30 04:58:06 2015 UTC,Anyone else seeing the last couple songs with crazy video delay? The framerate's all messed up and everything's in slow motion. The audio's fine though.

Roxy & Elsewhere: More Trouble Every Day  I would have said Son of Orange County/More Trouble Every Day, but since I have to pick one song specifically I'm going to go with the latter song. Quite possibly the best revision of any song ever.  Zappa In New York: The Torture Never Stops  My favorite version of this song.

Zappa,33zvrr,sweaterbrau,2,Mon Apr 27 04:55:31 2015 UTC,"I saw the Chicago show last week and I was kind of disappointed. They had a bunch of technical issues at the beginning, and Dweezil looked really bored, and he was just kind of phoning it in the whole night. It should have been called Guy-to-the-Left-Plays-Zappa, because he was the saving grace of the whole night. Dude gesticulates and does all the weird Frank vocalizations and knows every nuance of every song. He was great."
Zappa,33zvrr,brutalproduct,2,Mon Apr 27 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"I was there as well and couldn't agree more. I also couldn't stand the fact that Dweezil and the bass player fuct up so many times and just laughed it like no one was watching (Frank would've fired them, IMO). I can overlook the TD's..kinda.   I saw ZPZ with Dream Theater a couple years ago (Chicago Theater?) and while technically more sound, it was just another phoned-in performance. Damn shame. Although as you said, the rest of the band was great."
Zappa,33zvrr,sweaterbrau,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:24:34 2015 UTC,Did they do anything after the encore of Cosmik Debris? I had to leave shortly before that song was over.

Zappa,33zcs3,PaulTurkk,1 point,Mon Apr 27 01:32:37 2015 UTC,"Don Francis Bowman ""Sugarcane"" Harris   Born:  June 18, 1938  Died: November 30, 1999   Instruments:  Vocals, electric violin, violin, guitar, organ  Genre: Rock 'N Roll, Jazz, R&B  Don ""Sugarcane"" Harris was an American Rock 'N Roll violinist and guitarist. In 1954, Don Harris joined Dewey Terry, a founding member of a group called The Squires while still in high school. In 1955 the Squires released a record on the small Los Angeles-based label, Dig This Record. In 1957, the group broke up, but Don and Dewey remained together. Both Don and Dewey played guitar, with Dewey often doubling on keyboards. When not playing guitar or bass, Don occasionally played the electric violin, a skill for which he subsequently became well known under the name of ""Sugarcane"" Harris. Even after recording with Art Rupe on his Specialty label using the legendary drummer,Earl Palmer, Don and Dewey failed to record any hits.  After separating from Dewey Terry in the 1960s, Harris moved almost exclusively over to the electric violin. He was to reappear as a sideman with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers and Frank Zappa, most recognized for his appearances on Hot Rats, and on the Mothers of Invention albums Burnt Weeny Sandwich and Weasels Ripped My Flesh. His lead vocal and blues violin solo on a cover of Little Richard's ""Directly From My Heart to You"" on Weasels, and his extended solo on the lengthy ""Little House I Used To Live In"" on Weeny are considered highlights of those albums. Reportedly, he was rescued from a jail term by Zappa. Zappa had long admired Harris's playing and bailed him out of prison, resurrecting his career and ushering in a long period of creativity for the forgotten violin virtuoso. He played a couple of live concerts with Zappa's band in 1969.  During the early 1970s, Sugarcane fronted the Pure Food and Drug Act which included drummer Paul Lagos, guitarists Harvey Mandel and Randy Resnick, and bassist Victor Conte, who was the founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO). Conte replaced Larry Taylor who was the original bass player. His first solo album (with back cover art by underground poster artist Rick Griffin) is a forgotten masterpiece of blues, jazz, classical and funk compositions, and his 1973 live album Sugarcane's Got The Blues, recorded at the Berlin Jazz Festival show an accomplished musician at the top of his game.

Zappa,33wupp,slimjim321,9,Sun Apr 26 11:49:14 2015 UTC,"Berlin 1976. Best ever performance. Get the massive upgrade at Zappateers. Much less hiss because it is only a generation or two away from the master tape. I think the new version is from a safety copy as the master was destroyed in a flood or a fire or something. Taped by the legendary DogBreath, who taped all of Zappa's Berlin shows from 1972 on IIRC.  This is the version you want:  1976 03 04 Berlin DE 7.11 SC & 106.41 AUD 1st (DogBreath-WIU2B-JWB) ZTLS#658  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=29000  I love how the crowd's impatience only inspires Frank and the group to greater heights. And while you're at it,  also check out the following gigs' versions:  Passaic 1978 Evening Show (this gig was legendary before the video with its excellent audio feed appeared)  over 13 minutes of guitar and freakout music! 1978 10 13 (L) Passaic NJ 104.29 SBD (WP-GregZ-flambay) ZTLS#606  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=27457 or on video(!): 1978 10 13 (L) Passaic NJ 104.27 Pro-Shot NTSC DVD (Greg Z) - DVD 2/2  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=27804  1978 10 31 (longest Zappa gig, almost 4 hours without interruption) A really long version incorporating The Deathless Horsie. This rendition is officially available on Halloween (DVD-A), but the whole gig is a must-hear. It also features the definitive Watermelon In Easter Hay (performed as a guitar and violin duet), an amazing Packard Goose (with guitar and violin duels), a jam in 13/8, the only known seventies' rendition of Go Cry On Somebody Else's Shoulder, the last known Take Your Clothes Off (as a solo vehicle for Frank, Tommy and violinist L.Shenkar, featuring Arthur Barrow on acoustic guitar) and a beautiful opening solo. And it's complete (as long as you also download the ""service pack"" discovered after the initial upload, which fits in seamlessly, just replace the original file of that song)!  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=25363 http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=25390  Salt Lake City 1980  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=12666  Not in the same ballpark, but interesting. This show and the afternoon show are must-haves anyway and surfaced not too long ago. They're great quality board tapes. The afternoon show has the best City Of Tiny Lights ever (okay, maybe tied with Linz 1982).  Orchestral Favorites outtakes  The earliest circulating version of the song, recorded in concert, professionally mixed, but never released. Quality is very good, if a bit dull, but that can be fixed.  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=13818 if you only want the Black Napkins off this one, use this one: http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=28930 (compilation of the best outtakes, remastered professionally by JWB, received great reviews on a purist site such as this!)  also check out the following (enough descriptions for now, i'm getting tired):  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=21202 (featuring the unedited Zoot Allures version of BN) http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=11617  http://www.zappateers.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=18614"

The letters that came in to Bass Player Magazine were so harsh and personally offensive that I chose not to take an assignment as a columnist taking over for...some bass player who doesn't deserve to be named. OK, they weren't ALL mad at me. Probably 2/3 of them were unkind, but the 1/3 of them that liked me were fine. Whatever. That's not the point. The point is that they didn't get the full picture.

So I get Scott, I know what he means. He means that bassists should sort of calm down and not try to get too busy and recognize what their function is in a band. I don't think he'd be criticizing Geddy Lee at all. Maybe more those jam band textbook-slappin'-da-bass type dudes who really need to exercise restraint.

Zappa,33789b,Tundergaarth,2,Mon Apr 20 04:33:40 2015 UTC,"He's a pretty interesting author. ""I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream"" is one of my favorite short stories of all time, I recommend it wholeheartedly. Whether they ever collaborated, or even really paid much attention to each other, is sort of impossible to say, really."
Zappa,33789b,Herbderber,2,Mon Apr 20 15:06:44 2015 UTC,"Harlan Ellison had a column in the LA Free Press in the '60s-'70s (don't quote me on dates) called The Glass Teat. I would not be surprised if that was where Frank ran across the quote.  In addition to his stories, Harlan has written a Star Trek episode (City on the Edge of Forever), Twilight Zone and Outer Limits episodes, and what should have been the script for ""I, Robot"". Which was based on Asimov's work and was nothing like the POS that was filmed."
Zappa,33789b,Mule2go,1 point,Tue Apr 21 01:27:38 2015 UTC,"I've also read that Frank liked the Twilight zone alot too, so I feel like he may have known of Ellison."
Zappa,33789b,Fatmanredemption,1 point,Tue Apr 21 02:45:50 2015 UTC,"Ever read Harlan's original City on the Edge of Forever script? Funny thing about that book is how the opening 70 pages are dedicated to trashing Gene Roddenberry and William Shatner for messing with his script through several means of deception.  I've actually never watched Star Trek, but that was a very good screen play."
Zappa,33789b,Mule2go,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:11:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was fun to read."
Zappa,33789b,Fatmanredemption,2,Mon Apr 27 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh go out and read Death Bird Stories, and Slippage, and Edgeworks Vol 2, and Strange Wine! And everything else everyone's recommended.  Also Ellison is pretty similar in that he's massively prolific and an acquired taste even in the realm of speculative fiction, but unlike Frank, Harlan can really really talk your ear off and he's actually interested in doing it. With Frank you always got the feeling he would rather be doing something else and was trying to keep his answers short as possible. Harlan's really good at talking and is probably the only person you'll ever meet who can call upon obscure opulent words from his vocabulary in spontaneous conversation. Most writers can only come up with that manner of speaking when they're in the act of writing.  Go ahead and watch the documentary ""Dreams With Sharp Teeth.""  And this for fun: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jYT6WgNFFE  PROTIP: Read mostly late 60s-Present Ellison. Late 40s-mid 60s Ellison isn't as good. Though there are some really great stories from that time, they are few. You'll find most of the good ones from that era in grab-bag compilations (as opposed to the books I listed above which are more like his canonical ""albums."")"
Zappa,33789b,Mule2go,1 point,Fri Apr 24 00:07:58 2015 UTC,"I am a big fan of both but I am not aware of any collaboration of the two, nor any mention of Frank by Harlan Ellison.  But who knows? What i do know is Harlan Ellison is a phenomenal author. If you want a recommendation for your next book, try The Essential Ellison. Reading Harlan while listening to Frank is a fine waste of an afternoon."
Zappa,33789b,porter_esq,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:15:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks I have only known about Ellison for about 8 hours so my fascination and lack of background knowledge on him prompted me to ask this. However, he seems like an incredibly interesting figure and I will DEFINITELY be reading more of his work.   It just seems eerie that two guys that lived in the same city, with the same cynical worldview never even acknowledged the others existence other than sharing a quote (that I know of)."

A friend who was with him for the 18 months between his diagnosis and his death told me that Frank had a big piano in his living room.

Zappa,31og4c,GrammarWizard,2,Wed Apr 8 01:09:24 2015 UTC,"Upon further reflection, I'm assuming this is just media hype.  The Rage And The Fury was indeed created after Dance Me This, but it wasn't the last ""Frank Zappa"" album - it was an album of Varese music, not FZ music. Dance Me This is the last album of Frank's work.  And I highly doubt with the vaults being as packed as they are that Gail is gonna give up milking the cash cow any time soon. 100 is just a nice round number that people can grab on to, so it'd make sense to release something that people can equally refer to as FZ's 'last' album, rather than another live compilation or special edition or whatever."
Zappa,31og4c,3hj,1 point,Wed Apr 8 16:02:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's basically what I figured too. The media's making it seem like because this is the last album he was working on, that it's the last album of his that will be released, but I'm Gail's going to continue. The vault isn't empty yet."

Yet the man who took the photographs of the American musician Frank Zappa sitting on a lavatory has hardly made a penny from them.  Robert Davidson took a dozen pictures of Zappa in the bathroom of a central London hotel in 1967 to illustrate a newspaper article. Three months later, he claims, men sent by Herb Cohen, Zappa’s manager, arrived at his study in Soho and demanded he hand over the negatives.  “I had little alternative as they were threatening,” said Davidson, who photographed an array of bands during the 1960s, including the Rolling Stones and the Moody Blues.   For almost five decades, Davidson watched as merchandising of what became known as the ""toilet poster"" made a fortune. But last month, he received an email from Javaier Marcote, a Spanish fan of Zappa who had heard Davidson speak in 2010 about his desire to reclaim the negatives. ""He told me he had learnt the negatives were about to be sold online by a Los Angeles pop memorabilia company, Rockway Records,"" said Davidson. ""So I phone them and told them my story.""  Rockaway agreed to sell the 10 surviving negatives back to Davidson for US$99.  ""We had bought them from the Herb Cohen estate,"" said Mark Steckler of Rockaway. ""We are just glad that Robert Davidson could get them back.""  In an interview in 1983, Zappa, who released more than 60 albums including many with the band Mothers of Invention during a 30-year career that also saw him work as a film director, said: ""I'm probably more famous for sitting on the toilet than for anything else that I do.""  Zappa, who died from cancer in 1993, wrongly believed Davidson had denied him royalties from the photographs.  Davidson plans to include the images in an exhibition and may produce some limited editions.  ""Whatever I made financially I am determined that Frank's widow will receive 20 per cent, which is what I was promising Frank all those years ago,"" he said."

Then it is the guitarist's turn to surprise his host by playing Eric Dolphy's ""G.W.""

That Vai was able to figure out FZ and Vinnie's music using cassettes running at half-speed (digital tools can slow down to around 20%), which severely degrades the fidelity and thus one's ability to discern the pitch/rhythmic information, is further testament to his perseverance and genius in the art of transcribing.

Zappa,30mxgc,therefore4,5,Sat Mar 28 21:19:26 2015 UTC,"I'll copy-paste the comment I made over there over here:  ""Parallel fifths and fourths find their way into Frank Zappa's construction of harmony alot, vocal or otherwise. These days the use of parallel fourths (and to an extent fifths) is far more common than it was back in the 50s when it was seen as kind of unconventional and rule-breaking.  Parallel fifths/fourths were a common practice in the days of Gregorian chants, but were later phased out as harmony got more sophisticated. By the Baroque era, these parallel harmonies were in a sense forbidden and seen as antithetical to the concept of contrapuntal writing exemplified by Bach.  Later, composers like Claude Debussy study old Gregorian chants and actually become enamoured with parallel harmony and resurrect it. Over in America, jazz composers like Duke Ellington take a liking to Claude Debussy's richer, parallel, non-triadic harmonies, and base much of their arranging around that concept.  When doo-wop groups come around, their style of singing is like a very simplistic form of jazz, with a few non-triadic harmonies, but mostly based around the simplest of jazz ballad chord structures: I, VI-, II-7, V7. Needless to say, they sang with a lot of parallel fifths and fourths. Depending on the amount of singers, these fourths and fifths could be filled in and disguised by fleshing out the chord, or left bare, which Frank Zappa often chose to do (ie ""Shove it Right In,"" or the opening riff to ""Mom and Dad"")  The reason why FZ's teacher would bother to point this out was that, being a music teacher in the 1950s, he was likely formerly trained in the ways of contrapuntal Baroque harmony and saw these ""rule breaking"" parallel fourths and fifths as a huge distinguishing factor between the music he was teaching and the music FZ seemed to prefer.""  Bonus sentence: Actually, when I first heard Frank Zappa, one of the things about him that stood out to me was how often he chose to use parallel fifths/fourths in his arranging style."
Zappa,30mxgc,Fatmanredemption,2,Sun Mar 29 13:00:47 2015 UTC,"Would you mind explaining to me what, exactly, parallel fourths are?  Is it a melody line with a harmony line that's exactly a fourth above the melody, even if those notes are out of key?  I swear I'm a musician, but if rock journalism is like dancing about architecture, then music theory writing is like watching paint dry about sex."
Zappa,30mxgc,zakktravis,2,Sun Mar 29 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"In the strictest sense, it is exactly how you described it. However, in practice, parallel fourths mostly won't be used out of key if moving stepwise, and somebody's probably gonna sing an augmented fourth (tri-tone) at some point just to keep the notes diatonic (in key.)  Parallel fourths/fifths can also be found in basically any harmony that makes up a chord moving forward step wise. As in ""C-Eb-G goes to D-F-A."" In contrapuntal writing, that second chord would likely be written as C-F-A to avoid the parallel fifth created by the outline of the chord (C-G) moving up to D-A. Just because there's a third in the middle to flesh it out doesn't matter. A parallel fifth motion is still happening on the outside.  So, most singing groups will just do parallel fifths/fourths naturally because they just want to fill out a chord and don't really care much about contrary motion (ie C-E moving to A-F. Two notes moving away from or closer to eachother rather than traveling in the same direction.) Parallel fifths/fourths makes shit sound less flowery and more blunt, which FZ definitely liked.  Furthermore, you can see this parallel fourths/fifths influence very much in the Flo n' Eddy era, since often times when it was just those two singing, he wouldn't have them sing in 3rds or 6ths (which is the most common and ""consonant"" way to write for two voices,) but mostly sing in 4ths or 5ths, which gives it a very bare, even abrasive sort of sound."
Zappa,30mxgc,Fatmanredemption,3,Sun Mar 29 19:06:31 2015 UTC,"I think if you're passionate enough about music, you can just tell if a song is good or not without analyzing it. It connects with you."
Zappa,30mxgc,akimbocorndogs,10,Sat Mar 28 22:48:18 2015 UTC,"I thought I was probably the only person in the world who felt like this. I used to read record reviews and never could understand all the fucking nonsense these guys would write. Whether or not I like the record is all that ever mattered to me.
