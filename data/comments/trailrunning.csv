trailrunning,3e4w2x,brush_turkey,2,Wed Jul 22 05:59:04 2015 UTC,My dad told me a story that this reminded me of.  He and a friend were camping near a small creek in their town. They were camping deep in a small bamboo/river cane thicket and had woven a thick hut out of the green bamboo.   That evening they started to hear a baby crying. They followed the sound and hiked to the creek down a trail.   As they got close to the creek the crying stopped. When they came into view of the creek they saw a man with a shovel just finishing up filling a hole with dirt. When their bulldog saw the man across the creek he started barking.  The man chased my dad and his friend down but they out ran him because he had to run across the creek with was fairly wide but only knee deep.  Once they got back to their campsite (because they were too far out to return home on one go) they made a fire and sat back to back all night with their hatchets.  During the middle of the night their bulldog heard something in the woods and ran out to attack it. They heard all sorts of cussing and yelling. After a few minutes their dog came back with a boot.  He and his friend had never told that story to anyone until they both left their town and had grown up.

trailrunning,3du07g,koeidels,2,Sun Jul 19 13:27:48 2015 UTC,Taking a guess I would think that your long runs each week would be longer than the 16km (10M) races.  So just replace your long run each week with these races for the next three weeks.  It will be a different type of stress; just avoid extra punishment.    The rest of your week I think can be pretty normal with maybe changing any total speed workouts to 16-20km easy pace.  Take off extra days if you feel you need to.    If 12-16km is your long runs then I would cut way back and make any other running very easy/recovery.  Get out and walk the day after a race to get moving again.  Then two recovery paced runs the next few days; a normal pace run the day or two before the race and then repeat the next week.
trailrunning,3du07g,QMi6,2,Sun Jul 19 14:08:17 2015 UTC,"What QMi6 said. Just wanted to chime in as a fellow local - the series rocks. I normally only do the XL though since my body doesn't like too much strain too close together (gettin' older y'know). My suggestion would be can the mid-week runs in week 3 and week 4 if you're feeling overtrained/raced. It all depends on your normal training load, and if you're willing to take it easy in the races as opposed to all out. Good luck!"

I tried an Apple Watch and found the apps like Map My Fitness and too flaky. Not to mention I had GPS accuracy issues with apps like Runkeeper which don't sample points as frequently so tend to trip off turns and grossly under measure winding trails.  I have settled on a Suunto Ambit 3 Sport and really like the watch. I have it setup where I open the Movescount iPhone app after each run and the results are sent to Strava where I can get all kinds of details. I think you can find an Ambit 3 Run or Sport in your budget if you look around.

trailrunning,3dn7rg,safescience,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:11:40 2015 UTC,"GPS works great.  Locks in about 15 seconds and seems to be pretty accurate.  Never loses signal although trail runs tend to show a little short (as they do if I run with my phone).  Battery life is phenomenal.  I could get by with charging it once a week even running 3 times a week.  Without using the GPS it would probably run 2 weeks.    Only real complaint is that it doesn't always reconnect to my phone  automatically.  I leave my phone in my office and frequently have to run to to the other side of the building where it loses the bluetooth connection.  It usually reconnects, but not always.  I will say that it happens less frequently with each software update.  Could also be a problem with my phone which is getting some age on it.    Also, it isn't backlit all the time so the screen looks phenomenal in direct sunlight."

Also the bluetooth if really nice with your phone allowing you to easily make a workout and upload to watch before going out on a run.

trailrunning,3dn7rg,astralboy15,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:39:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not totally sure. I have a Peak and love it. I like the navigation is the biggest difference, I think both have the sleep recovery features. The bluetooth is on both too, which is pretty nice to have over the 2's, though you could always get a 2 Peak, you just have to hook it up to computer to make changes, which was kind of a pain. You also might look at the ambit 3 Run, that might have navigation and just a smaller battery, sells for $350"

trailrunning,3diaxg,out-of-order,5,Thu Jul 16 14:29:19 2015 UTC,"VFF can be great on the trail. Awesome with water, super responsive, great ground feel. I never had issues with them except when it came to trail racing.  Moving the feet faster, caught toes on roots a couple of times which I hadn't really done much plain ole running and that ish really smarts. For weeks afterward!  I would say that I would do better than that now stronger and with more time and experience - but currently my knees would call my bluff. And that's from training runs. LOL (At least they aren't rainbow colored anymore!)  I transitioned from VFF to Altra's a while back for a number of different reasons starting with the Superior 1.5. The ride on the 1.5 was not that much of a stretch from the VFF. Different of course, but not crazy drastic. Still good feel for the ground and I was actually able to spread the toes a bit more. Ahhh - so nice! The change for the Superior 1.5 to the 2.0 though - still struggling with the 2.0 100 some miles into the shoe.  The toe box is much narrower than the 1.5 and the tread is much more aggressive as well.  Thought that was going to be a great idea - but it turns out for me I really only need that tread for super super slick mud. The 1.5 doesn't grab very well in those conditions - but don't have that all that often.  And I just don't feel as stable in the 2.0. Roll my feet way more as I cruise over roots and navigate sugar sand. Feel like the wider toe box and I'm going to assume lower stack height on the 1.5 are the factors that make me favor that shoe.  But that's just my experience and ride preference. I think it kind of depends on what type of terrain you will be running the most. Everyone kind of has their own Goldilocks scenario based on their run style too. Hope that helps!"
trailrunning,3diaxg,D1rtrunn3r,5,Thu Jul 16 15:08:29 2015 UTC,"If you are a minimalist guy on the trails, I would recommend a full on shoe. Can be lightweight and minimal, but stay away from VFF/anything with your toes exposed. The only reason is for protection.   Some who run with VFF on the trail will disagree, but about three years ago in RMNP, I was running with a group and watched a guy who religiously ran in VFF snap his pinky toe, bent it almost 90 degrees sideways, catching it on a rock/root.   Go minimal, but give yourself that cushion for when you do punt an object, you'll be better off.   Just my .02 on avoiding an issue before it even starts."
trailrunning,3diaxg,elguiri,4,Thu Jul 16 17:05:02 2015 UTC,"Dude this is bizarre are you me from a month ago? I had this same dilemma I bought the Superior 2.0 on amazon, but once I got them I found two things. The first was that much padding felt weird. I have been running in 6mm or less on and off trails for about 5 years now. And it just felt weird, but I probably could get used to that. The thing I hated though is that at the toes instead of staying flat on the ground like, altras old shoes, it curves up like a traditional running shoe. Due to this every time you land you also kind of roll. It felt like it was messing with my bio-mechanics and I couldn't stand it, so I returned them. I went to REI and tried on a pair of Merrell Trail glove 3's and loved them right away. They are a bit thicker 10.5mm I believe and they do what a shoe should for me protect me from rocks and don't mess with my bio mechanics. That's just me personally though. I think Altra is a great company and there shoes work great for a lot of people, but not me(unless the toe curve thing changes). Personally try them both on if you can and see how they feel. Hope this helps!"
trailrunning,3diaxg,tabinsur,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:06:42 2015 UTC,it curves up like a traditional running shoe   I am so putting my 1.5 and 2.0 next to each other when I get home to compare. Didn't notice it but I bet you that's another reason why I'm tripping all over myself in the 2.0.
trailrunning,3diaxg,D1rtrunn3r,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:03:47 2015 UTC,yeah let me know I'd be curious to find out. My brother bought a pair of their original street shoes and it didn't have that up turn at the end. I don't know why they decided to add it.
trailrunning,3diaxg,tabinsur,3,Thu Jul 16 21:32:57 2015 UTC,"On a slightly different note, does anyone know where a Canadian might buy/order Trail Gloves these days? I can't find them anymore in the few stores that used to have them. Merrell's Canadian website doesn't even show that model either, as if it doesn't even exist.  Back to the question, I have two pairs of the original Trail Gloves and they are my go-to shoes for any trail. They provide enough protection against most things you could step on out there. As they wear you might start to notice the sharper rocks, but not to a painful extent.  Thicker shoes might provide better protection, but I'm of the opinion that a runner's best protection is watching where he/she steps. Trail runners and minimalist runners are both used to maintaining good awareness. If you want to be a minimalist trail runner, you sure as hell are going to have to keep an good eye on the ground. If you don't step on anything sharp, it won't matter much how much rubber is between you and the ground."

trailrunning,3diaxg,thedarkerside,3,Mon Jul 20 04:02:23 2015 UTC,"I loved the original trail gloves, and was ready to love the Trail Glove 3's until I bought them.  I like to wear them sockless, and I could not do that with the 3's.  The tongue had a lot of excess material toward the toes that didn't feel kind to the top of my foot, and I didn't like that the tongue was not connected on the sides.  Fine for a road shoe, but I don't want more places for trail junk to work its way in.  I returned them and bought another pair of New Balance MT10's.   I expected to hate the superior 1.5's that I bought on clearance, but I was relatively surprised how much I like them.  Look cheap, felt cheap, way too much padding around the ankles, sole feels like plastic, fully planned to hate them.  Ran 13.1 the first time out with them, no socks, and my feet felt great.  More midsole thickness than my other shoes, but it's firm enough that I don't feel like I'm running on a trampoline.  Most of my trail running is in VFF Spyridon MRs and New Balance MT10 (v2, with v3s in reserve).  I like the NB's a lot, wish they were 0mm instead of 4mm, but they feel much closer to 0mm than my other 4mm shoes."

trailrunning,3diaxg,itwillmakesenselater,2,Fri Jul 17 03:23:32 2015 UTC,I had a pair of altra superior 1.5 and hated them. They were so heavy and clunky that I got rid of them after about 50 miles. I decided to go with merrell bare access trail and they are way better. I like altras but I prefer merrell for a trail shoe.
trailrunning,3diaxg,so-very-very,2,Thu Jul 16 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"They are different shoes with similar benefits. As a shoe salesman who doesn't work off commission (meaning I sell shoes to make sure people get in something what's right for them not to pad my own pockets) I truly believe a true minimal shoe is something that 99.99% of the population should NOT wear. They offer almost no cushioning or support or anything that your body needs. Really all they do is make sure your foot doesn't get cut up. You really need to have incredible form to make a true minimal shoe work. My store used to carry them simply because they were a huge fad for a bit but since that has fallen off, we carry no true minimal shoes because they just don't work for most people. The huge benefit of Altra is that you get all the natural benefits of a minimal shoe (wide toebox, zero drop) while still getting cushion, support and even pronation control in a few models if you need it. I have the Superior 2.0's and they are one of my favorite shoes, ran a trail marathon in them not quite a month ago and they performed great. They're the thinnest and lightest trail shoe but still have a solid amount of cushioning, especially in the mid foot. They are super flexible as well. I usually only use them on the trails but I've taken them out on the road a couple times and the trail tread hasn't caused me any issues. I've also put on the new Lone Peak 2.5's and worn them around a bit (though haven't run in them). More cushioned and much stiffer and less flexible than the Superior if you prefer a stiff shoe. The 2.0's felt bulky and awkward to me, while the 2.5's have that natural feel Altra is looking for. Whatever you end up deciding, try them before you buy. If you go with an Altra, you're probably going to end up a half size bigger than you usually wear, they tend to run short (especially the superiors)"
trailrunning,3diaxg,zpppe,2,Thu Jul 16 23:24:22 2015 UTC,"I used to trail run in the VFF Spyridon (mostly in obstacle races, but I'd wear them on the odd trail run here and there) until I had to hop off trail to get around some people that just stopped in front of me. I ended up catching my pinky toe and either breaking it or severely damaging it (causing a Morton's Neuroma in the process). That was my last run in them.  I also had the original Merrell Trail Glove and thought I liked them....until I ran in Altra Lone Peaks. I thought I loved those until I ran in the Superior 1.0. Which I thought I loved until I ran in the Superior 2.0. The Superior 2.0 is easily my favorite trail shoe of all time, and I've run in VFF, Merrell, Salomon, New Balance, Inov-8, and vivobarefoot. Nothing close to the comfort and grip the Superior 2.0 has.  EDIT: Also, you can remove the rock plate in the Superior and still have great proprioception through a very flexible sole, but with added protection still over VFF and Merrell.

trailrunning,3de6t1,rehgaraf,13,Mon Jul 20 10:39:24 2015 UTC,"I did my first trail hm before doing a normal marathon or hm. You will be fine. Honestly I think you will enjoy it more, and that is more important in my opinion. I would suggest you get in some hills beforehand if its a hilly course. Good luck!"

trailrunning,3de6t1,Wrong_Swordfish,2,Wed Jul 15 16:51:37 2015 UTC,I did same thing as subOP and what you propose.  You will be fine.
trailrunning,3de6t1,Phaxda,2,Wed Jul 15 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"It becomes a mix of travel & running when you take it to trails, and less about intense racing (even though it still can be!). I did my first half on trails and wouldn't change it.  Yes, it was hard and a bit of a shock, but I felt strongly motivated to sign up for more races once I did it. Not sure if I would have been as vigorous about my next half if I had sweat on asphalt for couple hours."
trailrunning,3de6t1,rehgaraf,7,Wed Jul 15 23:34:48 2015 UTC,Totally not stupid; way more fun than hot boring pavement! Is there beer at the end?

trailrunning,3de6t1,secondary_walrus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:37:22 2015 UTC,Is there beer at the end? There is always beer at the end. It's just whether or not you brought it.
trailrunning,3de6t1,chokeonsteak,6,Thu Jul 16 10:25:30 2015 UTC,"Trail running is best running. I say go for it, but if you haven't been running any trails might want to go hit some trails maybe once a week leading up to the race. Even still, unless its some seriously technical terrain you'll likely be fine albeit a little unprepared."
trailrunning,3de6t1,Linkynet,2,Wed Jul 15 20:53:41 2015 UTC,"Well i mean, I've run two 10k's where I had to swim in mud basically so the terrain doesn't put me off, just the length/terrain combo, but everyone's been super positive here so I think I'll do it :)"

If you're comfortable with your endurance at that general distance, I think you'll be good.  The only problem I had with my race was heat and humidity - not the trails at all!"

trailrunning,3de6t1,Samkingbass,3,Thu Jul 16 13:09:44 2015 UTC,"Unless it's  flat, doing a half on pavement won't prepare you for certain things.  Go for the trail half and train on the trails, if there are big hills/climbs/downhills incorporate those into your training.  Trails are more fun anyway ;)"

trailrunning,3dac2f,zero0db,3,Tue Jul 14 18:59:55 2015 UTC,That's some solid gain. Well done! Where do you live to get that vert?
trailrunning,3dac2f,elguiri,8,Tue Jul 14 20:02:11 2015 UTC,Thanks for the encouraging words. I live in SF bay area and use Suunto Ambit3 and share the data with strava. Strava corrects the data for any errors. My average runs are 10mi long with 2000ft or less of elevation gains.
trailrunning,3dac2f,qqqsimmons,3,Tue Jul 14 20:09:18 2015 UTC,Nice job.    Do you manually track elevation gain?  My garmin forerunner is awful at tracking it.

trailrunning,3dac2f,megaface5,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:09:02 2015 UTC,So far so good. Been working on core and form since my last race which was terrible because of IT band issues.
trailrunning,3dac2f,megaface5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:51:59 2015 UTC,Did you find anything helpful for treating your knee? I've been getting a lot of vert lately and my knees are consistently sore. . .
trailrunning,3dac2f,secondary_walrus,2,Wed Jul 15 02:51:10 2015 UTC,I am working on my glutes consistently. I haven't had any persistent problems with my knee. Maybe you should get it checked with the doctor or a form check.
trailrunning,3dac2f,megaface5,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:33:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I can't argue with that. I set up an appointment with a doctor. Thanks for the motivation!"
trailrunning,3dac2f,kremfjes,2,Wed Jul 15 04:54:37 2015 UTC,"I did go to an orthopedist and he basically just suggested a few simple things for it, which have worked for me:  1) Stick to a stricter running schedule. Never miss rest days, never increase distance or elevation more than 10% at a time.  2) Prone leg lifts. Lie on your back, put on ankle weights, bend your knees and keep your feet on the ground. Then lift your leg up straight.  3) Try to focus more on good form when running.  Doing those things (and also doing less elevation than I did last year) has resulted in my knee being pretty much fine now - it took about 10 months for it to feel fully cleared up."
trailrunning,3dac2f,secondary_walrus,2,Fri Jul 17 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"Awesome, thanks! Those are all good ideas that I should have known to work on. Good to hear that it worked out for you!"
trailrunning,3dac2f,kremfjes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:26:56 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it's not from running back down, and not from the uphill running? Uphill running should be pretty harmless for the knees I think"
trailrunning,3dac2f,ajschirackjr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:24:26 2015 UTC,"While this may be biologically correct, it seems sort of irrelevant to the conversation - isn't it kind of implied that if you want to train elevation, you HAVE to come back down?"
trailrunning,3dac2f,secondary_walrus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:31:50 2015 UTC,"Well, yes and no. When I reach the top, I usually stop running, start a new walking-activity, and walk slowly back down while drinking some water and listening to some podcast. But I have had quite a few issues with my knees and legs over the years, so maybe I'm just extra careful..."

trailrunning,3dac2f,kremfjes,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:00:21 2015 UTC,Right on. I am thinking about changing my training. Limit the runs to two hours but trying to increase the tempo time in a run. Maybe one long run in a month. I am kind of plateauing.
trailrunning,3dac2f,spokanebeer,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:37:02 2015 UTC,"Plateauing how? Getting faster or just how the runs feel? My training isn't structured at all, so I sometimes don't have any long runs for a couple weeks but then the weather will be perfect and I'll have several in a week.  I don't really train to increase speed or distance though, just maintain so I can enjoy the trails around here in Boulder."

trailrunning,3dbq2l,milkywayyzz,2,Wed Jul 15 01:01:46 2015 UTC,"First... have you tried sizing up in your current shoe? You should have a thumbnails width of room between your longest toe and the front of the shoe. Your foot swells a decent among during a normal run (and I'm sure a lot more during a 2000+ mile thru hike).  I hike and run in the Lone Peak 1.5's and I love them. The wide toe box is very comfortable for long or multi-day hikes. I won't go back to hiking boots. Have not tried the 2.5's, not sure how they different. Just be aware that on the PCT, since they are a sneaker, you will probably go through at least a couple pairs. Mine last me about 600 miles, but I'm running on soft trails with roots, not hiking and scrambling on sharp rocks.  Zero drop shoes don't specifically address any injury. What they do is encourage a more natural running form by eliminating the 12mm heel-to-toe drop that most shoes have. For most people, this encourages them to land less hard on their heel and closer to their midfoot. By running this way, you engage your feet, calves, shins and achilles tendons as natural shock absorbers, instead of relying on the cushioning of shoe to absorb the shock for your heels and knees. This might help with your injury issues, but its not really the shoes that do it, its the form that you run with that ultimately helps. If you can learn to run with proper form, maybe that will take some pressure off your knee. No guarantees though, and since its not really a running injury per se, there might not be a whole lot you can do.  If you decide to try out a zero drop shoe, I would give yourself a good chunk of time to transition into it, especially if you have been training in a traditional shoe with a 12mm drop. The zero drop shoe will require more mobility from the achilles tendon, ankles and calves, and will alter what your shin muscles do through the gain cycle. I would take at least a month of slowly building up time in them before you are in them full time. In the first week, run the last mile of your runs in them. If that feels OK for your lower leg muscles, add a mile the next week, and so on. Make sure you listen to your body. Soreness is OK, pain is not.  This is a good resource for learning to run with proper form. Like transitioning to zero drop, it takes time. Focus on one thing at a time (slight forward lean, posture, foot strike, etc). Once you are comfortable doing that, add something else."
trailrunning,3dbq2l,big_alpine,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"damn, man. thanks for that answer! really interesting. i'm pumped on getting more into trail running because i just moved to a new area last week (grass valley, ca) and it seems that i am surrounded by rad trails....  the only difference i notice when trying on the 1.5 and 2.5 today is that the laminate on the 2.5 doesn't go as far over the toe which felt a little better. I sized up from 9.5 to 10.5. I really like the wide toe box and think I should have had something wider than the solomons for the last few years. the reason i want to figure out a shoe now is basically just what you said... I want to be used to them before going on something super long and i know that i will go through at least 3 pairs of shoes during the hike and don't want to switch to a different replacement shoe during that time. also, it seem like training myself to run different than i have been may be difficult but sounds like fun! thanks!"
trailrunning,3dbq2l,nathanwnelson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:38:22 2015 UTC,Just wanted to add another endorsement for running/hiking trails in the Lone Peak 1.5's...I currently have 557 miles on mine and have been using them on some significantly difficult trails (I know this is all relative). I'm hoping to get another 100 miles or so out of mine and then will go buy another pair.
