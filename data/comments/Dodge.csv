Dodge,3e61ll,MobConDan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:57:27 2015 UTC,I went with the mopar kicker 6-speaker set. It is a night and day difference from the base speakers and a slight upgrade from the alpine shstem
Dodge,3e5s4v,westernspaceviking,4,Wed Jul 22 04:19:38 2015 UTC,What improvements? Honestly curious.
Dodge,3e5s4v,LAfreak,1 point,Wed Jul 22 06:55:25 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm not really sure at all. I think improvements was the wrong word to use. It's just that, some car companies release a new model every year with no changes, while some completely re-do the design or handling or performance of the car, like what Chevrolet did making their Camaro more track-oriented. That's kind of what I was trying to say; whether Dodge will release it with no changes, or will change some things."
Dodge,3e5s4v,Purple_Git,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:09:03 2015 UTC,Well the blower pulley bearings need to be updated...
Dodge,3e5s4v,vhalember,1 point,Wed Jul 22 08:52:57 2015 UTC,"Plum Crazy is supposedly replacing B5 Blue as the rainbow color on the Chargers, but other than that I've heard very little.  As for ""build and improve"" I assume you're referring to the fact the engine is built to take MUCH more HP than it currently does.  I can't see dodge upping the HP rating, not yet at least.  Once you start seeing pulley swaps and tunes for Hellcats in the aftermarket, 800+ HP will be child's play, and cheap."
Dodge,3e5s4v,prescribedburn,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:48:10 2015 UTC,"I don't see any reason to think the Hellcat would see major changes in 2016. There may be little tweaks here and there like any new MY sees but they wouldn't look to overhaul any car the year after its update or release, like the 2015 Challenger or Charger. Especially when it's selling as well as the Hellcat."
Dodge,3e5s4v,wiseoracle,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:23:41 2015 UTC,Confirmed colors for 2016.

Dodge,3e4dry,moosic,5,Tue Jul 21 21:32:30 2015 UTC,Chrysler didn't brief their reps very well because I called this morning after seeing the video and the rep knew nothing about it and tried to say the press tries to make Chrysler look bad.
Dodge,3e4dry,FreedomsTorch,2,Tue Jul 21 22:08:46 2015 UTC,doesnt the article link directly to the update that patches this issue?
Dodge,3e4dry,NastyKnate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:06:19 2015 UTC,It does.
Dodge,3e4dry,NastyKnate,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:05:04 2015 UTC,so its been patched already......
Dodge,3e4dry,kowalski71,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:30:55 2015 UTC,Yes but it requires you to either install with a USB stick or at a dealer.
Dodge,3e4dry,NastyKnate,6,Wed Jul 22 03:06:03 2015 UTC,its 2015. if you cant use a usb stick you deserve to have to go to the dealer. neither option is hard.
Dodge,3e4dry,kowalski71,1 point,Wed Jul 22 05:39:36 2015 UTC,"But my point is that car owner's have to take action on this, it isn't like a Windows update that'll install automatically. So if you know anyone with an affected car, remind them."
Dodge,3e4dry,lilnas313,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:24:50 2015 UTC,Here is a link to the Wired article:  http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/  Here is a link to download the patch according to the article http://www.driveuconnect.com/software-update/
Dodge,3e4dry,lokochileno,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:13:28 2015 UTC,Can I download the update to a usb and just plug it into my uconnect USB port?
Dodge,3e4dry,Purple_Git,3,Wed Jul 22 02:36:07 2015 UTC,"I drive a 2012, and the way I did mine I put the file on an empty FAT32 formatted usb stick, loaded it on the car USB without car being on. Turned on car and let the firmware load."

I've been daily driving mine for a few years (in northern Wyoming for that matter). And it's been just perfectly fine, the weight of these cars really helps in snow and ice.  If you can afford a spare set of winter tires you'll be perfectly fine. Can't recommend these cars enough.  I'm sure with less power (I have an srt model) it'll be even better."

Dodge,3dssjo,-Youdont_knowme-,3,Mon Jul 20 04:09:34 2015 UTC,"I think if I were to ever get a challenger, it would be for a Challenger 392 Scat Pack Shaker package in plum crazy or black on black (that b5 blue is also damn sexy). I found a used challenger RT plum crazy shaker package for 30k with 10k miles on it, and that was the closest I came to actually selling my Charger for one... But I realized I'll keep saving and get one in a few years to keep my Charger, because I love my Charger to much.  As for the ride quality, it also depends on the trim level, and what you are looking to do with it. RT's/392 scats without the upgraded suspension package have a softer ride, which I very much prefer for long trips/daily driver. It's just more comfortable. The SRT/392 scat with suspension package can rattle your teeth out, but is much more fun in aggressive canyon/track driving. But as a daily, it can be obnoxious. My charger rattles so hard, the corner light actually pops out at times :("
