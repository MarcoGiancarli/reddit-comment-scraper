While it's not specifically related to anything transgender, seeing Jimmy Fallon in a shitty female costume on a huge screen like that, where part of the ""joke"" is how terrible he looks and sounds as a woman, immediately made me very, very self-conscious.

transgender,3dtszd,ninjawasp,48,Sun Jul 19 11:48:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm I'm not sure how I feel about this. I've always felt very mixed about Drag Shows.  On the one hand, I think they're great because they try to challenge gender norms directly, which is something that is definitely positive and constructive to the trans community (+ basically everyone else). Theoretically, the less we hinge on gender rolls, the easier it would be for a lot of trans people (in my opinion).  On the other hand, it does sometimes feel like they're making a joke out of me. The whole way they make their commentary on gender is by literally being ""dudes in dresses"" which is something that I struggle a lot with internally, so seeing people go ""haha look at those dudes in dresses how silly is that"" can be uncomfortable. And, sometimes, there are people that don't know the difference between drag preformers and trans people which is not fun to deal with.  All in all, I don't think it's a good idea to ban Drag Queens from a pride celebration, since they're part of pride's history. I do think there are some valid points that this brings up, but I think there are ways it can be solved without cutting out a part of our culture."
transgender,3dtszd,Jess-Me,0,Sun Jul 19 12:39:23 2015 UTC,"theyve said that they were interested in finding trans drag shows, it seems that the thing that they disagreed with was the drag shows consisting entirely of cis men, which i think is completely fair enough"
transgender,3dtszd,tapiocaprincess,20,Sun Jul 19 13:47:41 2015 UTC,"Would that make sense though? The core purpose of a drag show is that it IS cis men making fun of femininity, I think what makes it drag is that they don't identify as female which is also part of the gender commentary imo.  I have a hard time imagining a trans drag show because I feel like it would miss the point if it's a bunch of people dressing up as...themselves. Unless it's a bunch of trans guys dressing up as caricatures of femininity and vice versa which also seems weird because I feel like most trans people vehemently want to avoid doing that."
transgender,3dtszd,Jess-Me,17,Sun Jul 19 13:57:15 2015 UTC,"I identify as genderqueer, was born male assigned, and perform as both a drag king and queen in a burlesque community. My performances act as a vehicle to fully express my whole self that I don't get to do in everyday life, in addition to playing with sex and gender roles in a body positive way.   Blanketing drag as caricatures of gender is really simplifying an entire performance art. Yes, it is prominent, but there is much more to it than making fun of people's lives."
transgender,3dtszd,Illogical_Fallacy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:34:36 2015 UTC,"Yes! Finally a comment that reflects my feelings on the whole thing. People are saying that drag is all making fun of femininity, but the drag I've seen is more about dressing up and creating this beautiful female character who is also possibly talented at dancing/singing/acting modelling. I don't see the piss-taking there; more an art form that isn't saying anything negative about femininity.  Not to mention that I've heard of multiple queens that did drag before they came out as trans. It could act as a valuable experimenting/transitioning stage.  Obviously there's a wide variety but some queens see their character as a true reflection of their own personlity, or a stronger, more confident version of themselves. While others see it as just a performance piece where they are acting as someone else. I think it can be a deeply personal thing and shouldn't be brushed off as something that was just invented to insult people. Heck if I was talented enough I'd totally make myself a drag persona!  I worry that this blanket ban will start to create a general feeling of hostility towards drag, with other events phasing it out out of fear of being offensive. But I hope not. It can be a wonderful form of self expression.  I think a trans pride event with no cis drag acts would go down very well and not create hostilities. It just gets difficult because they are a central part of gay pride event entertainmemt."
transgender,3dtszd,John-Crichton,2,Tue Jul 21 16:47:27 2015 UTC,"Hear, hear!  I crossdress, but I don't consider myself transgender. I'm just a guy that loves women's clothes.  I struggled for the longest time to learn how to accept and love myself. Of all things, I did this through standup comedy, something I thought for the longest time I'd never be able to do. That I would do it in a dress would have been unthinkable.  And yet, last October I introduced a female character. She dresses to the nines and is always over the top, and people love her more than my regular shit, which I find conflicting.  You know, I could almost understand some Christian event turning people of my ilk away. But, a Pride event? Really? Somebody doesn't seem to get it."
transgender,3dtszd,thehalfwit,4,Mon Jul 20 04:50:08 2015 UTC,"I go to lots of drag shows and while most of the queens are gay cis men, there are a few performers that identify as trans woman. I think it's only getting more common from what I've seen"
transgender,3dtszd,HeadBandHalo,3,Sun Jul 19 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"There are two fundamental misunderstandings here:   The term transgender encompasses all types of gender variance, drag queens and male to female crossdressers included, and regardless of whether they identify as men, women or neither. They are trans, regardless. Many drag queens are gender dysphoric trans women. As is the case for crossdressers, many of them has to go through a period of soul searching before they admit to this, but that does not stop them from being so.    The percentage of drag queens who are gender dysphoric is unknown and may vary from culture to culture. One Thai sexologist tells me that she believes that as many as half of the Thai MTF drag performers identify as women.  I must add that I personally find most drag shows hard to grasp, including RuPaul's Drag Race and its exaggerated expressions of femininity. But my personal preferences do not matter. Many trans people clearly find this kind of entertainment liberating. I can live with that."

But what ever opinion I have it doesn’t matter because it’s pride and to say drag acts can’t perform goes against everything pride is about. To say a certain group of people can’t be free and express themselves because of what other people think/feel about them is essentially what homophobia and transphobia is.

transgender,3dtszd,mirandapd,3,Sun Jul 19 17:47:39 2015 UTC,"Let me start by saying, personally, I dislike drag. I have friends that do drag, I've done drag once in high school, and I would never tell someone else to not do drag. I personally am uncomfortable around it, and feel belittled by it. When I have attended shows to support causes that they were raising money for, I attended in constant trepidation that someone would mistake me for a drag queen. It's never happened, but it still makes me uncomfortable that it might.   But the rub is that when I go to work, school, or shopping; I expect those around me to be tolerant even if my presence makes them uncomfortable. I expect them to be respectful, and not attack me. I can't expect any less from myself when I am around people that cause me some discomfort.   So, let the drag queens and kings do their thing. As long as they aren't telling me how to do my thing, telling the unaware that I am the same thing that they are, or purposely focusing their act to specifically target my community, I should live and let live."

I was likewise a little uncomfortable at first...  But don't worry.  Pretty much no drag queen is ever going to mistake one of us for one of them.  We tend to do our make-up to fit in with society.  They do it to stand out from it.  It's a fairly radical difference.    Also, the audience around you picks up pretty quickly on the fact that you're sitting with them, not mostly hiding in a dressing room."

Not even most drag.  Some drag queens crack jokes or perform ""silly"" sketches, but often it's a high art form, reminiscent of Japanese Kabuki theater.  These (usually) men are enhancing their bodies, faces and movements to create living sculptures of (usually) their idea of idealized femininity.  The ""joke"" of a guy wearing a dress might be seen by some as funny enough for a three-second laugh in an old episode of MASH, but the drag shows that go on in most gay bars last for hours.  People wouldn't sit there and watch them, let alone dedicate a major hunk of their lives to being drag performers, if the only appeal to it was ""haw haw it's a man in a dress and make-up!  Isn't that weird and funny?""  Most drag shows in urban clubs look less like the shenanigans on RuPaul's show and more like this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDIutZPTgrA  Drag is not my cup of tea, but I kind of appreciate it for what it is."

Thanks Kanye, but I'm well aware of drag's history in gay culture and the many ways it can be performed.  That would be why I specified with as a punchline.    Funny story though: there used to be two very distinct kinds of blackface: ""minstreling"", which was ""high art"", and a way to bring black culture and music into white concert halls; and ""darkies"", who were themselves the butt of the joke, played to be the punchline.  It could be argued that only one of those was disrespectful, but we don't tolerate either any more, because that distinction is lost on those who are most influenced.    So yes, not all drag is played aa joke or punchline, but I still am not upset to see it phased out of pride events because it's a net negative to our community."

Many of the heroic trans people of color that we're always complaining were white-washed out of Stonewall history were also professional drag queens.  Drag queens may be (mostly) cisgender men, but they are still an integral part of LGBT+ culture and history, and honestly they belong at Pride if anybody does."
transgender,3dtszd,Heterogenic,4,Mon Jul 20 17:02:39 2015 UTC,"They can march.  Everyone can march.    But performances aren't about representation, they're about entertaining.  If a category of performances is frequently demeaning and denigrating (in a very hard to police way!) to the most marginalized sub-group of the community, it probably doesn't belong in the playbill.    And yes, many important LGBT heroes were drag queens.  But we can honour them for their heroism, not for their drag performances.  I've never heard Marsha P.

My drag has nothing to do with insulting Trans people, and if it does, I would invite them to speak with me personally about it.

Binary-identified trans folks felt like non-binary folks hurt their message, because outsiders not fully understand how important it is to treat a binary person as fully their gender, not half and half.   And now we have DERTs?  Drag-Exclusive Radical Trans folks?  My philosophy — you do you.

I'm sorry, but she's just not a good representative.  This conservative shitshow did all of this intentionally to create a story."
transgender,3dqqk8,iyzie,10,Sat Jul 18 19:44:49 2015 UTC,"This.  Tur is just about the weakest possible representative for trans activism out there.  Every time she's in the news it's because she said something that sets the movement back.  Consequently, she's the absolute favorite of networks who don't like us."
transgender,3dqqk8,3d6,18,Sat Jul 18 21:21:36 2015 UTC,"I know it can be so hard dealing with blatant disrespect but I really wish she would have taken the high road here.  Threatening for someone to ""go home in an ambulance"" is stooping down to their level. I'm not saying don't defend yourself- but do it intellectually.  The other woman even intervened and was trying to steer the conversation to brain scans of trans individual which could have been a great educational moment for people watching that are less informed.  That asshole of a man was just trying to push buttons and get a reaction and she gave him exactly what he wanted."
transgender,3dqqk8,danisarah,18,Sat Jul 18 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. When I give presentations and get that rare audience member that attempts to do this, I ask if they took a graduate level biology class. they usually say no. I then explain that high school and college biology classes only teach what the most common biological results are. That does not mean that they have even scratched the surface of what exists in reality. If this were not true, then a person could practice medicine with a high school diploma.  Then I turn to my giant Power Point presentation and click this link. After explaining the two genetic traits that caused the case, I then click this link. and explain how this occurs.  I then ask if they've ever had a karyotype done. They usually don't know what that is. I explain it to them and the fact that we have no earthly idea what a person's chromosomes are unless they've had a karyotype, and that they personally may have the opposite of what they believe themselves to have, but that out of respect for their autonomy, I will continue to use their preferred pronouns rather than use gender neutral terms until they present me with a verified karyotype report. That usually gets some laughs from the crowd, and politely points out their complete ignorance on the subject making every thing else they attempt to do extremely suspect."
transgender,3dqqk8,mirandapd,4,Sat Jul 18 17:12:44 2015 UTC,I've often navigated having to deal with biological essentialism.  The only person I've ever laid hands on is the guy who threatened to slap some sense into me.   Ms Tur severely crossed a line there.  Regardless of someone's opinions or statements they are entitled to their worldview.
transgender,3dqqk8,justja,0,Sat Jul 18 17:02:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to be forced to sit next to someone who is treating you that way. Violence no, but it was an absurd situation.   She should've gotten up and walked off set, but it's really hard to remain cool when you're being treated with that level of hate right to your face."
transgender,3dqqk8,Henchman24RIP,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:23:28 2015 UTC,"It's an absurd situation she walked into.  I'm not saying his stance was correct, or in any way consistent.  What I am saying is that regardless of his attitude, she knowingly walked into a situation where she would be confronted with opposing viewpoints.  She could have requested a change of seating, she could have declined to complete the debate.  Instead, she became condescending, started touching him in a manner he didn't seem comfortable with, and then resorted to a threat.  Not proper debate tactics.  This is not a random encounter.  This panel was assembled for a reason, as Dr Drew put it ""to attract eyeballs"".  I watched the full video, and her behavior doesn't get better.  To say it's because she was being disrespected is a pitiful excuse.  He was arguing the position he was brought in to champion.  I would say shame on the show's staff for not enforcing certain etiquette boundaries, but they didn't seem to care evenly."
transgender,3dqqk8,justja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:43:18 2015 UTC,"To say it's because she was being disrespected is a pitiful excuse   I have to agree.  It's essentially a fighting words defense, and it doesn't fly in most cases, at least not any longer thankfully.  If you threaten someone, you are committing verbal assault in most if not all states.  I highly doubt anything will come of it but it shouldn't have happened.  She could have called him any name in the book, or made him look like a fool and a bigot with evidence and not been guilty of this.  Intimidation by threat of physical assault however is crossing a line."

They say whatever insulting, degrading thing they please, but to actually retaliate is to give him exactly what he wants and just makes things worse. Which means we're forced to be nice, to be polite to a shitnugget while he insults us.  I agree with you. But the fact that you're right just makes me even angrier. Not at you, or even at him, but the whole situation."
transgender,3dqqk8,PariahSilver,20,Sun Jul 19 06:54:10 2015 UTC,"This is a perfect example of the tightrope that trans women have to walk in our incredibly cissexist culture.

This despite the fact that cisgender women can say very similar things in their own defense and be applauded for ""fighting patriarchy"""
transgender,3dqqk8,LokiOfMidgard,16,Sat Jul 18 15:50:54 2015 UTC,To be fair I don't think the people calling trans women men are usually the same people who applaud women for standing up to the patriarchy.

Then again, I read a lot of feminist, and liberal web pages, and not so many conservative ones, so maybe my experience is skewed."

transgender,3dqqk8,nohandsfootball,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:46:29 2015 UTC,"The point of a panel debate is not to convince other panelists, it's to convince the viewer.  Dr Drew supported her stance in the clip, separating Caitlin Jenner as a person from ""who deserves this award"".  I agree, the two issues are separate.  The big issue is that Tur didn't come prepared.  Shapiro was doing his part, getting out talking points and rebuttals.  Tur should have been better prepared, and kept her cool.  I don't even think he meant the ""Sir"" as a disrespect, he views Tur as a man, and was attempting to get her attention while she was being overly condescending."

All of the right wing blogs are going off on this situation, in a very disgusting/revolting way. I really worry that it's going to lead to violence against trans women.   I don't understand why these people can't just leave us alone. I don't think they realize that when they dehumanize us in this way they're not just voicing opinions, but causing very real damage to lives. Idiots see the way they treat us and their emulation of that treatment leads to murder and suicide.   Maybe they realize that and don't care, but I really wish they could at least tone down their vileness a little. The way this whole situation has been handled has been completely inhuman.   I just want to feel safe, but situations like this are why I signed up for martial arts/self defense classes.   Zoey is stronger than I am, so I can't fault her for a reaction that I would've probably surpassed.   It's also worth noting that Dr Drew should be ashamed of putting this situation together.   There should never have been a debate over the award, because nothing healthy could become of it. They definitely shouldn't have sat a transphobic prick from Breitbart right next to a trans woman.  They set this up, and it's going to cause real damage to our community, and they should be held accountable for their part in this."

Best thing to do would've been to drown the fucker in actual biology facts and watch him try to either double-down and look like an even bigger ass, or else try to disengage without trying to appear defeated.

People who didn't know what was going on inside of me  might have interpreted that as ""enjoying being a girl"", but they know jack fuck all about how I really felt, or what motivated me to behave the way I did.   I will never stop being suspicious of the claim ""but such and such transgender person looooooved being their birth assigned gender!!!"" unless it comes straight out of that trans person's mouth. We're all under so much external pressure to conform and ignore our own needs that cis people's opinions of our gender identities are completely irrelevant. They absolutely cannot be accurate or reliable judges of what is really happening with us. For all they know, he could have been miserable inside. Happy people don't lock themselves in the bathroom and shoot themselves.  Never mind how stupid it is to conflate gender roles with gender identity. Even if he was genuinely girly, that doesn't mean he can't be a boy."
transgender,3dmqbb,Skeptekr,6,Fri Jul 17 19:34:31 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. And I also feel that adults are sometimes extremely bad at judging children's and teens' emotional well-being, while at the same time claiming authority over them. A rant now follows:  It's something I'm very bitter about. I suffer from avoidant personality disorder. I was always kind of troubled, and I was just deathly afraid of school, and it got progressively worse, until, at 16, I had a breakdown and tried to kill myself, but ultimately aborted the attempt, leaving only relatively shallow wounds on my wrists. It hadn't been meant as a cry for help, but it was visible, and I also felt I just had to tell the adults about it, because I just couldn't go on like that.   And what do you know, after years of being yelled at, accused of being lazy, accused of faking being ill, of my grades getting worse and worse, along with my classroom discipline, attendance and behavior - when I came to school with those red streaks across my wrists, suddenly everybody was like, ""Oh my God, how could that happen, why didn't you say something?"" Well, I said a lot, but I also hid a lot, because I felt my situation was hopeless. And they didn't bother to ask and just assumed I was lazy and dishonest. And I wasn't the only one like that in our class.  It's a cliché teenage thing to say that adults just don't understand. But very often, they really don't. Very often, they don't even try.  This concludes inpu's teenage anger rant."
transgender,3dmqbb,inpu,3,Fri Jul 17 20:11:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Another thing that occurred to me is the article claims Sam's mother's side of the family had no idea he was transitioning.   Gee, I wonder why he would have kept that from them? Maybe the same reason he might've pretended to be OK with being a girl while around them? It's not hard to suspect that there was more going on there than his family lets on."

I mean I can't know for sure of course, I'm not him.  But I know that even though I live in a very supportive and loving environment myself, I still struggle with suicidal thoughts and they are almost never about me being trans/dysphoric anymore.

Caitlyn Jenner follows in a notable trend where many LGBT athletes opt to come out after their careers have ended, because keeping their identity hidden was the only way they could survive as competitors, as athletes, and as people.     I believe the award is meant to inspire all of the closeted people who are involved in the ofttimes bigoted and non inclusive world of professional sports, to come out and be themselves.  They shouldn't have to wait until they are retired to come out."

Not to a celebrity who decided 40 years after the olympics to change genders  I really do not have anything against her or trans, but her award for ""courage"" was really just the media looking for an outlet of $$$.

The biggest things are  1)checking in with other girls  2)paying in cash 3)paying by the night 4)check-in time. These probably seem innocuous and wouldn't occur to most people but the current climate is hyper-paranoid about sex work, especially right now during vacation season when hotels are getting a ton of traffic. It's soo messed up that one of these red flags is simply being trans woman (and especially a trans woman of color). That needs to change but until it does, I hope everyone is careful and look out for yourselves. Watch out!  It's so wrong on so many levels. First they push you to the margins and deny you employment. Then they criminalize your means of survival and punish you for things you to do to stay safe (carrying condoms, having a safe anonymous place to work). Then they reduce trans identity to those very survival tactics and use your identity as evidence that you MUST be doing something illegal. Their identities are literally being criminalized. So fucked up! *And then the fact that she was arrested for not having a prescription, denied hormones in prison like so many trans people? It just shows gatekeeping is backed up by state violence, same as ever. This is like everything thats wrong with how LE treat trans women of color.

As for Caitlyn, she is courageous. Do you have any idea what it's like to live your life feeling guilt, shame, fear, loneliness, and abandonment? Do you have any idea how much courage it must have taken for her to stand up in front of 1,000's of her peers, and in front of the entire world, and be herself? To stand proudly and proclaim, 'This is me, this is who I am.'? Seeing her have the courage to be herself filled me, and I'm sure many others - not just trans,  with the confidence and ability to further accept myself and know that I am just fine the way I am. You may not think that's courageous, but I sure do. You may not support her, but I sure do.   Further, you call her a sell out. For what, a few extra million? She doesn't need the money.

Both have perfect Corporate Equality Index scores. Saks had a score of 90 before their rating was suspended. It's awesome that HRC has encouraged corporations to make policies for people who transition on the job, but it's also awesome that we have laws in place to prevent discrimination and make sure these companies aren't just nominally anti-discrimination. But my big concern is hiring discrimination. The experience of people who have established corporate careers before they transition is way different from trans people who are just entering the job market or who have less stable employment (we see the highest growth in low-wage service jobs, so that's a big deal)."

The point is that someone willing to discriminate will find ways around the law - whereas most corporations don't work against their own policies (which doesn't mean that some managers don't follow those policies) - but this idea of the HRC rankings as meaningless is not more of a true statement than ENDA is meaningless."

I don't disagree with any of this. In fact I bring up hiring to point out that policy alone can't solve these underlying cultural biases. How do we begin to address that?  Just imagine how much worse it would be if we didn't have any anti-discrimination law in place! Yikes!   but this idea of the HRC rankings as meaningless    Straw man. You seem really set on ascribing that view to me but no... Again I think it's good, just not by itself sufficient. I'm not a (big l) Libertarian. I happen to think it's a good thing that we have stronger protections than just an employee handbook or corporate policies that often go unenforced. I don't agree with this idea that the free market will provide sufficient regulatory pressure absent of state regulations, and I'm providing some evidence to support that (hey to take it even further, there's a pretty strong argument that labor deregulation over the past 30 or so years is partially responsible for all the employment instability and low/negative wage growth we see today; that disproportionately affects minority groups. why hasn't the free market delivered the solution, it's been decades now). The EEOC has had a pretty huge impact. Of course regulation alone won't solve systemic social issues but it's incrementally better.

Companies participate in the list because they see value in being able to boast that an independent group rates them as LGBT friendly.    The way that this simple idea has effectively pushed for much better corporate policies all over America is kind of huge, and is a demonstration of why sometimes the best activism is that which seeks to transform the culture, rather than merely the law."

The beginning is critiquing the infighting in the trans community, and suddenly the author starts endorsing it, resorting to transphobia against a facet of the community to do it.  The real irony comes in when the author tries to challenge the proclivity of some trans people to retreat from the community and blend back into broader society, while simultaneously making an argument for why they should.

The article was stating that when Caitlyn's status was previously read by others as  cis-hetero-male, not that she was of that status. Because of this perception, she was to gain prestige which allows her voice to be heard by a larger audience.   People from marginalized racial and ethnic groups or those that are not read as cis-hetero have a harder time gaining a similar position of prestige in society and that is why their voices are not heard by as large of an audience.

The fact that when they later on, after backlash, brought in a trans writer from an affiliate website, and that trans person immediately noticed what they'd done wrong, to their utter confusion, just goes to show how rough and insensitive their editorial staff are.

The only reason Bailey is still breathing after this devastating and extremely funny attack is that he probably does not understand what she says. He is too caught up in 19th century sexist dogma.  Let me also use this opportunity to recommend her book Nevada, a intelligent and earnest description of gender dysphoria and sexual desire."

The article raises some good points about terminology (like ""biologically a boy""), but it's also overreaching in its message.  I'm a trans woman. I'm a woman. I was born a man. For all it gets off on its high horse about not dictating identities to people, the article sure does try to erase my narrative."

transgender,3d2yr4,bleedinglikeaphoenix,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:02:38 2015 UTC,"The main part of the article in contention:   I want to make a few things perfectly clear. Trans women are women. Period. End of story. We’re not “women who used to be men.” We’re not “men who identify as women.” We’re not “males who identify as women.” We’re not “men who became women.” WE ARE WOMEN. Stop putting qualifiers on our womanhood. It’s offensive, hurtful and cruel to insinuate otherwise. Our past, present, and futures are ours to define and no one else’s. Even if we didn’t figure out that we were trans until well into our adult lives, it absolutely does not mean that we were ever boys or men.   These are very sweeping statements about the entire community. She's speaking as though she represents the thoughts of all trans women everywhere.  She does temper it in the next paragraph with   Of course, there are people who do identify as having been a boy or a man before transition. As Mey and I discussed in our piece about Martine Rothblatt, those people ALSO have the right to define their own narrative, and it absolutely should be reported as they prefer. However, that makes it even MORE important to explain that, while this specific person identifies or describes themselves in that way, many trans people do not.    but the language here is much less powerful than in the above. Now it's ""there are people"" and ""this specific person"", whereas before it's ""we"", ""ours"", ""we"", ""we"", ""we"". Very collective. shrug I didn't like it.   I wouldn't say that my views are the dominant ones given the pervasiveness of a particular trans narrative that is told time and again. The media's favorite story is a blending of the two: ""a trans woman was born a man and always knew that he [sic, because of course misgendering] wanted to be a girl since a young age"".  She's speaking out against one half of it while reinforcing the other."

I believe that is what the author is fighting, and I've had to fight myself a thousand times. Always knowing, is not the same as being born male identified (boy/man) as far as gender identities goes. Many are confused and never identified as male, others of us knew.  The problem is in the way the media is saying it. For both you and me. I wasn't ""born a man"" but I did know from a young age. I was only born a girl who is a gender minority."

That's what most cis people think, and the erasure is of those who weren't born boys and not born male identified.  Maybe the language of the article should be better, however, the narrative of boy becomes girl is the norm, and the other way that the author spoke is the minority narrative in the public's eye.  As someone not born a boy, I've had to correct that more times than anything. My narrative is systematically erased as the article is saying. All our narratives should be valid, and no one should be making assumptions of our pre-transition identities and ways of seeing the world."
transgender,3d2yr4,Hypatia_the_Wrathful,11,Wed Jul 15 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"I agree with you for the mostpart, but this:   without feeling like they're less trans for not always feeling like a girl   just kinda rubbed me the wrong way.    I was born a boy and I was raised as a boy and I grew into a man.  This has nothing to do with how I feel inside or how I think I should have been born and raised.  Some of my earliest memories involve the knowledge that I should have been born female.    It's taken me almost 30 years to get over all that denial and shame I've felt my whole life for knowing that me being male is a birth defect, but, for the moment, I'm still male.  When I do transition, that won't change the fact that at this moment, I am a male and have been so all this time.    If I was born with a cleft lip, getting that fixed wouldn't mean I never had a cleft lip.  My body is what makes me male, my feelings don't make me a female, but my future efforts will.    I wasn't ""assigned male at birth.""  I was assigned to a male upbringing due to the genitalia I was born with but while that upringing of course plays into all this a lot, my problem is not with society, my problem is with my body and the genitalia I was born with.  And it is a problem, because what else would you call a birth defect?    I'm sorry but that whole ""don't say trans women were born boys"" just rubs me the wrong way because if I wasn't ""born a boy,"" then I wouldn't have had a problem all this time and I wouldn't need to transition.  If I wasn't born a boy, then I could just do what the TERFs sometimes seem to say and ""just wear a dress if I want to wear a dress"" (which is not what all this is about!).    Society is to blame for the shame I've felt for all this all this time but society is not to blame for my dysphoria.  Having been born a boy is to blame for my dysphoria.  I don't want to be ""trans"" or ""MtF"" and I'm certainly not happy about having been ""born a boy.""  I just want to be a woman.  But I will be trans and MtF and I'll always have been ""born a boy"" and as much as all that pains me, lying to myself about those facts are not going to change those facts.  I feel the author that birth genders and genitalia are focused on way too much when it comes to anything in the public's attention involving anything trans but that whole obsession society has with our private parts is not going to be rectified by attempting to erase my history or my reality or anybody else's, tragic as they all may be."
transgender,3d2yr4,dualitynyc,3,Mon Jul 13 04:05:29 2015 UTC,"I have not yet resolved how I feel about my gender identity in the past tense, but as I said elsewhere in-thread, I don't necessarily feel the way the author or her examples do about their past. But I didn't get a sense of erasure from that or from the person you responded to. It may not address my situation, but it addresses a real and pervasive problem for the many women who do feel their identity is best described as girl from the get-go. It's hard to think of an example of an article not written by a trans author that does not play to the ""born a boy"" meme. If that does not bother you, or if it describes how you feel about your past, then it's not a problem. I thought the author quite adequately acknowledged that some of us feel that way. But there's not much to say about it because it's a non-problem with respect to the media's handling on this particular issue."

A lot of people know very few or possibly no transgender persons at all, and one can't really expect people in general to be aquainted with all the nuances of the territory, no? I mean people in general have probably never thought about the difference between sex and gender in their entire life, so to expect them to ""get it"" immediately... maybe it's too much to ask?

transgender,3d2yr4,BWV639,16,Mon Jul 13 03:56:59 2015 UTC,"This article was directed at other journalists who repeatedly use the terms. This isn't about your friend or relative messing up, it is about how the press talks about trans people, and how terms like ""born a man but identifies as female"" are used to sensationalize and exploit while marking trans women's gender as illegitimate. Honestly, if someone were to say ""when you were a guy"" in conversation to me I probably wouldn't even notice, or I'd subtly correct them with ""I was never really a guy, but before I transitioned..."" Journalists pieces are carefully edited and the words chosen deliberately so it's not unreasonable to try to correct a common problematic phrasing.  EDIT - An example: you can say ""Dylan Roof murdered 9 people in cold blood"" and few people would object. But in the media they say he ""allegedly"" killed them. This is a consequence of our criminal justice system. The media uses this term to avoid unduly stigmatizing someone not yet convicted of a crime. If we afford someone like Dylan Roof this measure of respect I think we can also do the same for Janet Mock when she says that she did not used to be a man."
transgender,3d2yr4,AprilRyan8,2,Mon Jul 13 05:28:39 2015 UTC,"This article was directed at other journalists who repeatedly use the terms.   I fully agree, and I think that's an very valid point; journalists should know better. My assumption was that the scope of the article was greater than just journalists and the media, and Mari Brighe seemed, to me, to be talking about journalists, media, and also people in general. It's obviosuly more difficult for the latter to not be hurtful, even if well-intentioned, if the former doesn't give a shit."
transgender,3d2yr4,BWV639,6,Mon Jul 13 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"I want to point out that the purpose of this is not to invalidate anyone who identifies as being one gender then changing to another. If that is your truth then by all means tell it. It's about how trans people are talked about in general. When the press talks about our pre transition pasts (and only when such topics are relevant) the default should be assigned male/female at birth. This terminology encompasses everyone and does not place an asterisk by anyone's identity. If the author is interviewing a trans person and they in their own words say ""I was a man and now I am a woman"" we should not jump down anyone's throat. I would commend any journalist who attempts to unpack the complexities of various gender identities for the lay public. But using a phrase that makes our genders seem artificial for the sake of ""simplicity"" should be called out."

If it's a choice between someone perceiving me as ""really a boy"" vs ""always a girl, mistakenly raised as a boy"" I'll take the latter every time. It isn't how I always understood myself--though I think it's pretty true in my case, even before I understood myself in those terms--but it's a form of ""born this way,"" a philosophically flawed but extremely powerful empathy-building argument.

transgender,3d2yr4,RevengeOfSalmacis,0,Mon Jul 13 07:14:25 2015 UTC,"The term ""assigned"" male/female at birth has always bothered me.  (I am not trans, but I have a trans* son.)  It sounds to me as if the baby is born neuter, with no visible genitalia, like a doll, and someone arbitrarily says ""Okay, this one will be a boy -- this one will be a girl. . ."" and then they are named and dressed accordingly.    ""Assigned"" implies, at least to me, a degree of randomness that ignores the physical cues that are present at birth.  I understand that many trans people (though not my son) feel that they were always one gender despite the fact that people thought they were the other, but to me saying they were ""assumed to be male"" or ""considered male"" would explain the circumstance better than ""assigned male.""  Oh well, the terminology has been accepted by the people most affected and I'll do my best to get used to it!"
transgender,3d2yr4,khoff98107,6,Mon Jul 13 14:54:37 2015 UTC,"""assigned X"" was popularized for a few reasons, one of which being that the medical establishment operates with a power to legally identify a person, and that power is very, very difficult to overturn later in life. It makes visible a system at power in play which often acts as an obstacle to trans people being recognized and treated as they should be.   if it was just an assumption, or consideration, that would be different, and the child or parents could just go on with their lives without worry, but the reality is that we have legal IDs with components based on this assignment. And those components can be difficult, or impossible, to change after the fact.   So the assigned X at birth thing just makes that visible, it shines light on the fact that the medical community and society brand a person at birth, and are very, very reluctant to change their mind about such decisions, let alone let people take control of that information later on in life.  Though you are right, the word usage does imply a bit that physical attributes at birth can be ignored. This is important, knowing, for instance, that not everyone with a penis is a boy/man, and not every boy/man has a penis."
transgender,3d2yr4,lockedge,2,Mon Jul 13 17:52:34 2015 UTC,"A lot of people do use assumed or considered instead of assigned. It's one of those ""use whichever feels most comfortable to you"" dealios."

Like, I sorta get what you're saying but. It also kinda doesn't make sense. Assign literally just means ""attribute something as belonging."" It doesn't really have to do with randomness? They see that you have a penis or vagina and say, ""Well, they're male/female.""  and in reality, there's no such thing as a pervasive trans narrative. almost all of us are different in some ways. so a trans person should be allowed to use whatever language they're comfortable with, without someone saying that they sound wrong? especially if you're just talking about semantics. :/"

And it might sound rude but its 1) not rude, just factual 2) quite a bit of trans people don't want to hear cis people talking about how we should identify/speak about our bodies 3) its the exact same way about other forms of oppression. If a white woman with a black adopted son was like, ""hmmm well this is how i feel about whether all black people should say Black American or African American to identify"" like...who cares? its not your business. its an intra-community thing.  edit: and for a fourth point, it really IS a semantics issue (I don't know why you put it in quotes, but whatever).

The first has no bearing on anything and is again poooointleeeesss. Because tons of people make those comments all the time and aren't looking to be educated. The latter is concise and doesn't offer information that doesn't matter.  What it seems to me your issue is, bc im not gonna try and tell you what you think you're saying because that's ridiculous to do, is that you're bothered by the fact that I'm bothered by it. I know what I'm saying, I know what THEY are saying through the information presented to me and without further comment, and you don't like that I'm bothered by it, and you think I'm wrong when in fact both your point of nonoffense and politically correct hand-holding AND my point of issue with the statement are both correct, because they're how WE feel about our OWN shit. You don't have to dislike what they had to say. But you can't tell someone what they can and can't be offended/bothered by things when its themselves.   ""I guess I'll have to get used to it!"" Yeah, girl, get used to it. You acknowledge that and even more make your comment pointless since you know that your opinion isn't relevant and it isn't your decision.  So agree to disagree."

transgender,3d2yr4,nohandsfootball,0,Wed Jul 15 05:40:41 2015 UTC,"Saying ""this doesn't make sense"" and ""this doesn't make sense to me"" are both the exact same thing. There is NO semantical difference, unless you preface or follow is by saying something like, ""CAN YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THIS,"" And that was nowhere. Its about context. I don't know the innermost thoughts of this person and I wasn't in their head when they wrote it. AGAIN, I took what they said as it was presented to me. The person offered their unsolicited opinion of something that they even concluded was a nonissue at the end of their text, and wasn't their business in the first place, and you got mad because I have an issue with it, which as a trans person I have every right to have an issue with things that cis people say when they don't know what they're talking about.   So now you've turned it into this huge issue trying to tell me that I'm wrong and that you're right, when both of our opinions on the matter are valid. Which I said in my last post. I dunno if this is YOUR parent, and that's why you're being so dense about this, but the conversation is over. You're clearly not getting what I'm saying, and you think I can't understand what you're saying, and now you're literally trying to insult my intelligence with passive aggressive remarks, and I'm not the one. So let's part ways, because this is tired."

transgender,3d2yup,DiDgr8,-3,Mon Jul 13 04:01:11 2015 UTC,"Feminism is kind of inherently cissexist and racist and I don't think there is any fixing it. Feminism for trans women is called trans feminism, feminism for black women is called black feminism, and white cis feminism is just called feminism. Most feminist issues focus on the wants and needs of white cis women, and most feminist narratives are told from the perspective of white cis women and white culture. This seems to be slowly changing in the feminist community, but will never really change anything in mainstream feminism. I don't think feminism would even be mainstream if it cared about all types of women equally."
transgender,3cyxe8,leelaginelle,29,Sun Jul 12 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"I feel that this article, while well intentioned, misses the mark.  The author closes with the idea that people can't make jokes about groups to which they do not belong. This is nonsense. A well crafted joke can be told by anyone, about anyone. The process of crafting such a joke takes into account the perspectives of both the teller and the group being addressed.   The safest way to do so is to make the teller the subject of the joke, even when the context is about another group. (For example, a joke about embarrassing yourself by saying something that sounds racist, but you didn't mean it that way.) However, the joke can still work as long as the teller doesn't place himself above the subject. Placing oneself above the subject is what's known as ""punching down"" and comes across as bullying the defenseless.  For example, one of the most successful and respected working comics of the modern era, Louis CK, makes plenty of jokes about groups to which he does not belong. But his jokes typically elevate those groups above himself, and his self depreciating style makes his comments feel mostly ""safe."" (As opposed to threatening or disparaging.)  The problem with the joke in the article isn't who told it or who it's about, it's that it's poorly crafted. There's certainly some meat on the bone regarding the subject and premise of the joke. Certainly trans women have a certain level of insight into the experience of men that cis women typically would not. The status of headlines of women's magazines being ""click bait"" level quality isn't an unknown concept.   The problem is that the comedian in question didn't craft those concepts into a well thought out form. Her semantics left it sounding like a mockery of Caitlyn's status as a woman, as if women are only now getting what they are promised because they are being deceived.  If she truly didn't mean it that way, she should feel regret that her joke was poorly crafted and left people with the wrong impression. Even if she doesn't feel the need to apologize for her intentions, she should be eager to qualify them and express regret that they were misinterpreted.  Her offense at the offended is what really damns her in my mind. Her defensiveness makes me think she really doesn't care if people took her joke the wrong way and felt hurt, which makes me wonder if her joke was actually misinterpreted in the first place."
transgender,3cyxe8,MadSaintAlice,11,Sun Jul 12 04:03:51 2015 UTC,"My first thought when reading that part was of Louis CK.  I have no problem with comedians telling Trans jokes, but I do have an issue with lazy comedians who get all self righteous when called out on their lack of effort."

That means a lot of old attitudes need to be addressed, and need to be confronted.  It hurts people more than it is funny.  That's the problem."

Feel free to downvote to make this no longer visible.  I think she's somewhat right- to a point. I'm a transman, for example. As a kid, I grew up with all the stigma of being female, with the added frustration of not feeling like a girl. Would it be fair to say that I don't know what it's like to suffer as a young woman, even though I considered myself a boy?  Caitlyn was probably bullied for being feminine by other men, but she never had to fear walking down the street or people dismissing her opinion just because she's a girl. However, she did inherit it when she finally came out as who she is, plus some because transwomen have to worry much more than other women do.  I'll never know what it was like going through puberty as a boy, and she'll never know it as a girl. Still, she has the ability to speak about women's rights because she now gets to experience all of this bias and stigma firsthand. Saying that what she writes about equalitism is only a man's perspective is frankly hurtful."
transgender,3cyxe8,AlbinoMetroid,16,Sun Jul 12 03:14:07 2015 UTC,"Caitlyn won't know what it's like to go through puberty as a girl because she lived in a transphobic society that prevented her from doing so. It's totally cissexist to say Caitlyn, who's a trans woman, received the privilege of being a cis man. If Caitlyn was a cis man, than being forced to live as a cis man would have been great. She wasn't, though. She was forced to hide who she was and live in the closet with dysphoria, and almost killed herself. Cis women, like that comedian, who say trans women were privileged to be forcibly socialized as cis men are blind to their own privilege as cis people in a ciscentric society, and unconsciously transmisogynist."
transgender,3cyxe8,AlbinoMetroid,5,Sun Jul 12 03:56:01 2015 UTC,"She definitely won't know what it's like to live as a cis man either, what I am saying is that she grew up with a different kind of sexism than most women face.

It was really gross witnessing such prejudice from a community who knows exactly what it's like to have that applied to themselves.  I'm looking forward to seeing great things from Caitlyn and wish her nothing but the very best!"
transgender,3coaqh,jessicasecret,18,Thu Jul 9 17:34:21 2015 UTC,"The criticism of Caitlyn is hypocritical when you consider the reception afforded to Laura Jane Grace. Both had no choice but to come out in a public manner, both have chosen to speak to publications about it, both have gotten involved with the media and had their own platforms created about their transition.   Caitlyn probably has the greater wealth by a decent amount but I doubt Laura is struggling financially, I imagine Against Me! have seen a sharp rise in their fan base and subsequent sales as a direct result of Laura coming out.  Not bashing either. I like them both. I think they are both great roles models. But I think Caitlyn is being bitched about because    She's older.  She's not indie/alternative. She had FFS surgery. She's edging towards binary fem.   I don't thing she deserves the grief she's getting. Yes she's older, but she's not only just become trans, she attempted undercover transition in the 80's before backing out. It's not as though she hasn't struggled for decades over this. I don't see why anyone would be jealous of her regardless of her financial position.   I think if you criticize Caitlyn then you have to do the same for Laura. Not that either of them should be subject to approval by the trans community. They should be able to be as public or private about their transitions, or make as much or as little money as they want."

transgender,3coaqh,jessicasecret,7,Thu Jul 9 18:29:27 2015 UTC,"Yes. When it was announced that Caitlyn had undergone it there was that whole counter campaign of people doing their own Vanity Fair cover, predominantly to raise awareness that not all transpeople look like Caitlyn.  I don't know for sure why people are hating on her. It seems to me like these are some of the reasons. The fact that Laura Jane Grace gets none of the same criticism shows that it's not about being famous or having money.    I reckon half of it is anti-binaryism, half-ageism / dislike towards late transitioners. And people out there don't want to be represented by such a person."

I had the same discomfort as many of you at first during her very public transition, but she hasn't made any great missteps either. Waiting to heal up post ffs before coming out just means she didn't want any more sneering tabloid photos; the cover of Vanity Fair can only be understood as a response to those images, and I for one felt great sympathy. I know what it's like to be sneered at in early transition as a pathetic man in drag, then later validated as an attractive woman: the indignation at the arbitrary injustice of it, but also the empowerment of having forced the world to actually make sense to me. Can't say I would have done things any differently.   If she uses her spotlight well--and she has decades of media savvy to draw on--she could be really good for us."

Does that mean they can't, or shouldn't, advocate for equality? Or as another example, I didn't grow up with parents who rejected me being trans a kid and forced me to live as a gender I didn't identify as (even if I had recognized at that age I doubt my family would have done that). Does that mean I shouldn't be an advocate for those individuals? Likewise I'm younger and not transitioning later in life, like Caitlyn and many others have, so does that mean I should not look at the issues that part of our community has to deal with and work to fix it?   She's extremely fortunate in having the financial position she does, and I haven't heard her say one thing that makes me think she doesn't recognize that is not typical of the vast majority of trans individuals. But she is trans. And while she may not have lived through all the experiences through her life that brings with it, she does have to deal with trans issues.   Since she is also doing things publicly means she may not understand the needs and troubles trans poeple must endure and must be stealth. Sure, she can be told by other trans people how it is...but unless you live it... it's a whole other ball game.   Very true. She has the financial freedom to be ""out and proud"" so to speak. Many of us don't have that luxury. Many of us live in areas where we can't be out at all and have to be stealth. But her being out there talking about trans issues, even if she hasn't lived them all, only helps get that information out there so others think about things and maybe actually work to enact positive change for those who can't be ""out and proud.""

When you're popular, you're left with a responsability of acting correctly because others look up to you. When you mess up, others are affected to.   Absolutely.

When people give me shit in real life, it's like how can I even blame them, the one transgender person people know (Caitlyn Jenner) literally publicized her transition for attention and money that brings, she's not a role model by any stretch of the imagionation."

I personally appreciate all that she's doing to include the trans community in her journey and I respect her humility.

transgender,3cip9y,Angel_Feather,0,Thu Jul 9 09:07:08 2015 UTC,I'm actually a moderator of /r/Anarchism. I'm also a trans person. I thought that was the only prerequisite of participating here :(
transgender,3cip9y,flaxrabbit,2,Thu Jul 9 14:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, let's let all the John Wayne Gacys and Ted Bundys out of prison and into normal society with the child molesters. Yeah, good idea, chum."
transgender,3cjk3s,tea-girl,7,Wed Jul 8 12:18:06 2015 UTC,"ugh, i can't believe the trans therapist cited says, ""don't transition to be a bimbo"" and hopes caitlyn doesn't get ""too caught up with the dresses, make-up, etc."" as though caitlyn (and women generally) cannot actually enjoy those things for themselves  like i get the intent, but being feminine is not equivalent to being a bimbo - how can someone decrying objectification do that very same thing?"
transgender,3cjk3s,nohandsfootball,2,Wed Jul 8 16:59:24 2015 UTC,"We are constantly pathologized for being feminine when cis women aren't, for exactly the same behaviors. It's gross."
transgender,3cjk3s,Granny_Weatherwax,2,Wed Jul 8 19:57:41 2015 UTC,huh?
transgender,3cjk3s,nohandsfootball,3,Wed Jul 8 20:02:24 2015 UTC,"I accidentally a word. Trying to say that society pathologizes behaviors in trans women that it deems acceptable for cis women, like being femme. Somehow when we do it, it's a problem, when they do it it's totally normal."
transgender,3cjk3s,Granny_Weatherwax,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:24:59 2015 UTC,"Lots of women are criticized for being ""overly vain"" or ""superficial"" - see anyone who condemns a woman for any cosmetic surgery. Wearing ""too much make up"" - dressing ""like a slut"" - etc.   Cis women are criticized for the same behaviors. Female politicians (and business women) have dealt with the same catch 22 for decades where they have to straddle the same misogynistic line between ""too masculine"" and ""too feminine"" - it just happens in different ways."
transgender,3cjk3s,nohandsfootball,0,Wed Jul 8 22:31:28 2015 UTC,You're telling me that cis women on the cover of vanity fair in the past got the same response for being femme that Caitlyn Jenner did?
transgender,3cjk3s,Granny_Weatherwax,3,Wed Jul 8 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"Welcome to being a woman in American media. Men are celebrated for accomplishments, women are looked at for their bodies. It's pretty sad."
transgender,3cjk3s,Dunden17,-2,Wed Jul 8 16:55:16 2015 UTC,"What? How skewed does your view have to be to think that women exclusively, are appreciated on a physical level? Good lord."
transgender,3cjk3s,PyroSpark,-2,Wed Jul 8 20:11:51 2015 UTC,And it doesn't constitute a part of men's somehow? O_o  You need to expose yourself to more than just women sources. Seriously.
transgender,3cjk3s,PyroSpark,-2,Thu Jul 9 03:08:40 2015 UTC,"Well then I guess our experiences are completely different. Because I'd bet plenty of people would be willing to disagree with you on that. Mostly this   An unattractive man who is a hard worker that gets things done is often given a pass on attractiveness when it comes to determining their worth.   Guess what, PEOPLE are given a pass when they're rich. A pass on attractiveness? Pleeeeaaase.  And either way, it's not a pissing contest.   Remember that just because you lucked out as a male early on, does not mean your views represent the majority."
transgender,3cjk3s,PyroSpark,-1,Thu Jul 9 03:18:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't luck out. I was an ugly, fat, miserable person with a horrible personality, and I hated my life and the world.   Whaaat? But I thought being a man was so wonderful and being ugly and fat didn't matter? Shocker, shocker.   Fuck you for triggering those awful memories. Take your mra bullshit and fuck off.   Way to encourage the stereotype of lgbt people being absurdly sensitive. It's the internet. Not everyone is going to treat you like a child."
transgender,3cjk3s,PyroSpark,-1,Thu Jul 9 13:25:24 2015 UTC,"That's not what I said; you're twisting words.   You said looks didn't matter nearly as much with a man, as they did with a woman. So I figure being fat and ugly wouldn't even be worth mentioning. But whatever.   intentionally push buttons to piss people off, and then blame them for being upset.   Don't blame people because you're always looking for ways to be offended."
transgender,3cjk3s,PyroSpark,2,Thu Jul 9 16:44:01 2015 UTC,"The article is from Fox News, what were you expecting?"
transgender,3cjk3s,KasseanaTheGreat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"Dear God! Don't read the comment section on that article. It's horrible, and for those with morbid curiosities, I'm gonna give a major discrimination and anti-affirmation trigger warning right now.  Damn."
transgender,3cjk3s,THAT_IS_MY_PORPOISE,-1,Thu Jul 9 18:32:32 2015 UTC,lols! Yeh sure.  But it's hard to imagine anyone with their own reality tv show would actually care.
