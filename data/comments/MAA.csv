And the cower proc rate is too horrible,  it's just too powerful a debuff if you ask me. Plus Enchantress's Charmed or whatever it is, I would take them all to nerf city."
MAA,3e66er,rawrzez,2,Wed Jul 22 07:07:43 2015 UTC,The fact that Enchantress' Charmed doesn't apply Recovering is stupid. I've had characters lose turns twice in a row due to Charmed way more often than I should.

I just had a match between my Victor Mancha/Beta Ray Bill/Agent (cube, warbringer axe, Li'l Boomer, signpost) against a Nul/Iron Fist team, high up in Adamantium.   Iron Fist kept preventing my electrical strategy from working at all, and kept healing up his team. It went about 25 rounds and by the end it was just my agent against Iron Fist, going after each other over and over again, healing themselves and whittling each other down.

With Deadpool's 'Ridiculous A-Iso', there's a perfectly valid gameplan there. Hell, I've got all of my Uncanny X-Force characters with their alts. I might even bring along Wolverine and have him get in on the boon busting fun with the X-Force bonus that Deadpool gives him. I dunno. It's worth playing around.

I do like that the MM pistol gets boon buster, but honestly 2/3 heroes having Boon Buster is fine, my agent used to be pure support; make buff unremovable AND sat support turn 1... if it went to 4 rounds, my tough as balls support agent becomes a 1 shot AOE exploit all death machine... that final turn i'd use the tact turn from the empowered suit, use the Scarlet witch thing on the cube, and then back to back AOE death via the Sat support and the cube's atom smasher.  But now that I use the relentless rapier, I tend to just clean up if a follow up doesn't proc from DP's lvl or someone is left with a sliver after Psy's lvl 9 (also eiso'ed, so she can lock out some heroes whihc rocks) that got follow upped.  In fact it's rare that I use the SS, as now that I use the RR over the CC, I can activate it and proc follow ups from the Mental Coord and drop the other team like dominoes.

I cycled through a bunch of team/set-ups and now I'm using:  Emp Inf Agent w/ Relentless, Huggin's, Staff of Ask, WCD and the Cube, Inf P5 Emma with her Eternal E-Iso and two Maddening A-Isos, and Modern Tac Star-Lord.    I know there's no real synergy between them, but they do surprisingly well.  Mostly because Emma's Mental Anguish nearly one-shots anyone and her Phoenix passive seems to proc a lot more and seriously buffs whoever has it.  I think she was buffed in a recent-ish patch?  Star-Lord because he's just awesome supplying extra turns and has a debuff for everything he faces, and the Agent is there to keep everyone alive.  I forgot how well the Staff of Ask heals, esp. w/ the Cube and WCD.  I haven't used it in ages, but Pestress really required me to step up the heals since so many I'm seeing have a crap ton of defense making it difficult to kill them quickly.

MAA,3e30sd,chonzy2127,5,Tue Jul 21 15:55:43 2015 UTC,"He's actually pretty strong when combined with the full formican set. I rely on ANTenna + L6 to 1-shot key enemy characters, since L6 exploits each debuff from ANTenna. I don't have Star Lord, but I use cyclop's evasive maneuvers to proc finest hour, and that can occasionally one-shot people through their shields.  I don't think he'll be too useful in PvP though. There's far too many characters with brutal strike to guarantee Become the Hero, and I don't trust the AI to use combos like the one I described."
MAA,3e30sd,forum_name,3,Tue Jul 21 17:32:03 2015 UTC,"Congrats on finishing your first Spec Op, and more than two weeks early.  Plenty of time to farm up any gear or A-ISO you might have missed.  As for Ant-Man, I'm underwhelmed.  While I realize their value, I'm not a huge fan of Infiltrators in general, and I don't believe in taking up half my Agent gear slots to make a single character worth my time.  With that in mind, I do appreciate his self-rez and how well his L2 and L6 go together.  Once he's leveled and ISOd, he's not the dead weight that he used to be in M2 and M3 of the Spec Op.    I think on balance, he has the potential to be huge for me in Alaska (on ten minute Flight Deck missions), but I don't see him becoming one of my ten or so go-to heroes."
MAA,3e30sd,PhoenixAsh21,2,Tue Jul 21 19:12:31 2015 UTC,"I like him so far. His L9 attack is really useful for setting up his follow-up attacks. (Applying grounded to flying enemies so that his L2 will hit and apply Intimidated, thus allowing him to perform his follow-up attacks.)  When you use him right, he can be very useful in battle, but if you don't know what you're doing, he won't be much help."

MAA,3e30sd,r2d_touche,2,Tue Jul 21 17:49:51 2015 UTC,That's because heroes are always weak when you get paired with them in the spec ops. They aren't iso'd so their stats are lower than the rest of your heroes.   During the Runaways spec ops using Chase Stein was awful >.>

Also, the old destroyer thing is good, it's AOE intimidate (QA with the tact safeguard suit to boot.).  He would also be good with ares, as Ares does that intimidate randomly, and can also apply some opportunist buff is you have his aiso.  But mostly, i'm just leveling him in 12.4 (500xp per run) and the guardian insignia is great for both the agent and antman... he can do some nasty 'flash kicks' lol"

The thunder attack does a lot on damage, unavoidable and with his iso it triggers static charge  Storm - Tac - Classic alt - Windy iso - ( 8 strong iso )  Id do storms 3rd attack first then 4th attack next round (or next turn if attacked by blaster) as her 4th attack exploits effect of her 3rd attack, her moves also trigger static charge (her first attack does also) she also gives everyone protective shroud at the beginning of the game with is helpful.

MAA,3e1dp5,JonBStoutWork,4,Tue Jul 21 05:29:11 2015 UTC,"You've got a few options here.   What I would do if I were you is grind Quicksilver up to level 14 as soon as possible, and - if you haven't done so already; I can't tell from this image - get him one of his alternate suits. It might be worth being a bit patient on this since he'll be getting an Age of Ultron one soon which could be better than his existing ones.   Get the 'pulverizing' a-iso and put it on his level 2 attack, and you've immediately got a mutant meat-grinder on your hands; it will apply 'wide open' to the entire enemy line, which increases all melee damage taken, which of course is everything Pietro does, as well as 'combo setup', which increases unarmed damage.   Partner him up with a good solid brawler. My suggestion: Get Luke Cage up to a decent level and buy his unique E-Iso from the store. It's a little pricey but well worth it; it gives him the 'tag team' trait, which gives him occasional bonus turns when one of your team - INCLUDING LUKE HIMSELF - does an unarmed attack. I have sometimes seen him give himself four bonus attacks in a row this way; it's brutal. He and Pietro will compliment each other very nicely. And of course once you unlock Nul, Luke becomes like ten times as dangerous.   Now you just give your agent some nice unarmed melee attacks to capitalize on what these two are setting up and you've got yourself a really solid team."
MAA,3e1dp5,shoe_owner,2,Tue Jul 21 08:52:03 2015 UTC,I've seen a lot of Hugin's Eye and T-Bolt Glove combos wouldn't that completely negate that set-up?

MAA,3e1dp5,LordAshur,2,Tue Jul 21 12:21:22 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, Luke Cage applies Staggered on his Lvl 9, which gets you around Hugin's Eye. T-Bolt Glove is still an issue though.  As far as other combos, you could go Dr. Strange with his Simulator eISO (forget the name) and Invisible Woman, if you have her Air Pressure eISO. This should keep debuffs off of you rather well and allow Dr. Strange to build up his power. Alternatively, you could go normal Dr. Strange, with both his eISOs and Magik with her aISO. By turn two, you should have a ton of debuffs for Dr. Strange to exploit."
MAA,3e1dp5,mrbreadpig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:58:37 2015 UTC,I've leveled Iron Fist considerably and will be getting his Worthy version first. Seems like a good pairing with Quicksilver.  The current combo has been quite effective against most teams. Gets around a lot of Enchantress problems.

MAA,3dynsp,WhiskeyFlask,8,Mon Jul 20 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, the task is to beat Taskmaster not win the battle.  You can also do this for when  you have to beat XX Miniboss you can go in and just kill the miniboss, die to lose the battle (you can't just refresh to my knowledge) and then you get credit for the task and can still get the bonus for not killing the miniboss when you kill the boss."

MAA,3dynsp,mfhowland,2,Mon Jul 20 17:22:36 2015 UTC,"That works, but there is always a task later to 4-star all the missions, and this strategy just works against that.  Better to just 3-bird (if you can handle it) then do another run, imo."
MAA,3dynsp,Sylthren,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:55:32 2015 UTC,How does it work against it?  It's more energy efficient to get the Spec Ops hero faster.  You can do the researches earlier and don't have to wait as long to finish.  Doing it twice works but for me it's just inefficient since you can 3 * in two runs with the right team (I use Hulk/Thor).  Also the Spec Ops task is 3 * the optional one to get the for gold set item is 4 *
MAA,3dynsp,Grimbear13,3,Mon Jul 20 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"Energy efficiency < U-Iso efficiency.   ""Getting the hero faster, getting to researches earlier, waiting as long to finish""... we're talking about one day here.  Max.  Not even that if you hit some iso roulettes.  In the end, you're going to have to wait for more Isos to get the stars you need anyway, and if you tank your score by intentionally losing a battle that wait will be even longer.  Of course, this is really only in consideration of 4-starring for the weapon.  But who the heck wouldn't want to reach for that goal??"
MAA,3dynsp,Sylthren,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:54:38 2015 UTC,"The same thing happened to me during the Mystique fight from Spec Ops 2.  If you continue with the Epic Fight, bring your heaviest hitter because Ant Man will be at Level 1. Unless you leave the SO up while you power level him..."
MAA,3dynsp,quaint28,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:23 2015 UTC,"I solved this by letting Ant-Man flight deck his way to level 6 while I got to five stars in M1 and M2.  The M2 boss fight was a pain in the ass, but now that Ant-Man is no longer mint-in-box, there are some ISO slots and he has three of his four abilities, so he's not 100% useless.  Don't get me wrong...he's still basically a vending machine with hit points...but he's less useless at level 6 than he is at level 1."
MAA,3dynsp,PhoenixAsh21,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:57 2015 UTC,I do the same but I like to use 12.2 epics and 12.4 to powerlevel him to 9. I only pick 9 because it's the quickest route to ISO slots and his lvl9 - if the lvl9 on a character seems to suck then leveling to lvl8 is sufficient.
MAA,3e0ec4,InvictusArchangel,10,Tue Jul 21 00:09:35 2015 UTC,"Can grant team mates extra turns, default counter grants rising up. Can recycle combat awareness every turn, survivalist. Hardly one of the worse on the roster in my opinion unless you were expecting a powerhouse. But as a support, he is amazing. But I will agree, that e-iso is a waste, considering that if you play as Falcon, you are going to favor his lvl 2 anyway, so its better to just give him ukemi and skullthumper instead. But no, he isn't top tier, but I wouldn't go as far as call him bottom tier, or the worst."
MAA,3e0ec4,livewire2k14,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:40:21 2015 UTC,"I like much Ant-Man. I was not happy about another infiltrator, but I watched the movie last night and it makes sense that in the game is an infiltrator. You really nailed it with the positive points of Falcon. I'll check it out later but for now he's in the Waiting Room. I have it in lvl 9."
MAA,3e0ec4,livewire2k14,4,Tue Jul 21 00:46:52 2015 UTC,"But Ant-man in this game plays very well. And while Falcon would be a good team up with him, ironically (heheheh, watch the film, you'll get it), Ant-man plays much better with Star-Lord because of both the rising up counter from his lvl 1 and counter and because Star-lord can definitely lay down those opportunist debuffs. It kind of sucks because in the boss fights you play him in the spec Ops, you can't use his level 2 right away if there are flying targets, and he has no means of gaining those rising up buffs by himself, and since its just you and Agent and you need to keep the agent alive instead of buffing ant-man, you won't see his true potential.  But boost his attack, slap that erupting a-iso on Ant-man's level 2, and pair him with Falcon, Star-Lord, Gorgon, Heimdall, etc, (Star-Lord is still optimal), and Ant-man's lvl 6 hits like a truck. But once again, infiltrator... bad idea, since Scrappers can follow up and kill him before he can revive, BUT, that counter and pain train is really good."
MAA,3e0ec4,onekumar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:58:24 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I see what you did there. And yes that's why I didn't want him as another infiltrator, that's his weakness, but when he is ready, he can hit twice like a scrapper."

IF you have him iso'd properly he can help you stay in fights for longer periods of time. If you have 1 healer and 1 attacker, you can really do damage by alternating LV2 and LV4 attacks.  If you're lucky and get enemy tacticians, he becomes even more useful."

MAA,3dy7fp,LordAshur,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:36:32 2015 UTC,"I use this setup in almost ALL of my boss/epic boss battles, especially on Spec Ops.   Bring in Iron Man (MK42/43 suits recommended) with Automated ISO-8 (Tech Upgrade) on his Unibeam. Or Cable with the same ISO on his Techno-Organic Rampage. Just beware of Tact Hawkeye if you chose Blasters. If you don't have the Tech Upgrade ISO, any damage boosting one will do. As for E-ISO, if you went Blaster, I recommend the Explosive one as the splash damage will also increase as your damage increases with stacks from Unibeam Focus/Power Contained. Else, any good E-ISO will do. Buy at least 3 or 4 Chrono Accelerators. And a few Tactical Strikes and Armor Piercers. You're gonna use these on Iron Man or Cable. Item usage (Quartermaster) will help with the final Score if you need points for Mission Mastery. As for Agent setup, gear that gives extra turns would be great, like Quantum Jumper. Well, I use it. Oh, and the Combat Communicator might get you that early turn for easy setup. Otherwise, any support gear would do. Make the Agent an Infiltrator to counter Hawkeye. Once you get a turn, any turn, use the Chrono on the Agent. Agent uses Tactical Strike on Iron Man/Cable. Use another Chrono on Ant-Man. Scott uses Armor Piercer on Iron Man/Cable. Then use Chrono on Iron Man/Cable. Spam Iron Man's Unibeam/Cable's Rampage on the boss with the least HP. Use a Stamina item for Iron Man when needed. Agent and Scott continues with support. Repeat until bosses are dead. The stacked damage from Unibeam Focus/Power Contained makes the next wave simple. I usually one-shot both bosses once I get a turn in. TLDR: Bring Iron Man/Cable, use extra turn and ignore defense items/gear on Iron Man/Cable, spam Iron Man L9/Cable second L6, Agent and Ant-Man support. Rinse, repeat."

MAA,3dw1qr,WebWarrior32,5,Mon Jul 20 00:28:53 2015 UTC,"My numbers are 505 attacks, 475 wins,  259 losses, rating 1165. I'm level 206, I have never in this pvp fought a higher rated opponent, so if I win I win small and if I lose I lose big.  The highest points I got on offense was 14, but my average win got me +6/7 points and my average loss is -22 points.  :("
MAA,3dw1qr,offpower,3,Mon Jul 20 01:37:36 2015 UTC,"For me, number of attacks are the biggest predictor of PVP success.  Because I'm missing some heroes and I only have a handful of characters at 14, I tend to lose quite a bit of offense (naturally I also lose quite a bit on defense, as well).  Last season I had 644 wins and 462 losses (a winning percentage of 58.23).  I finished in the high 1600s in rating and around 10,000th place overall (2.24%).  This season I presently have 384 wins and 263 losses (a winning percentage of of 59.35).  That puts me in the high 1500s in rating and in the top 8000 (1.5%) or so.    I know this is paltry compared to many, but I find that if I can manage to win 3/5ths of my fights, I'm generally okay as long as I have a high volume of attacks.  It's interesting to me that such a low(ish) rating makes for a such a (relatively) high percentile score.  It suggests to me that there are a lot of players out there who:  A) belong higher than me but haven't climbed to their rightful place yet,  B) belong higher than me but can't climb for whatever reason, or   C) are simply gone or not PVPing in this tournament."
MAA,3dw1qr,PhoenixAsh21,3,Mon Jul 20 01:15:30 2015 UTC,"I nearly quit this season besides my 5 after I lost over 300 points in 2 days on defenses and something called ""processing""    Playdom awarded me 5 gold for me losing 127 points to processing and having 21 defenses in a 16 hour period where I lost another 200ish points.  After I submit my ticket.  I went from 1251 to 998 then did my 5 battles (winning 4/5 (-22, +1 x 4) and found my score was down another 29 points, because I'd lost another defense in the 15 minutes it took to do the offensive fights...  It took forever to get out of gold and fighting people with crazy high bonuses (teams I usually face when I get into mid vibranium).  Then over the past 4 days I've worked my way out of dropping from low/mid diamond to gold to have to do it all over again to getting back to high diamond low vibranium over and over.  I'm at 332 wins 172 losses (65.8% winning), but I'm still only at 1187 rating (after I just logged back on and saw I was down 48 points again -___-).  I'm currently in the area where if I win I get 8-12 points, but if I lose I lose 20-24 points on offense.  The problem is I only win about 20-25% of my defenses, and I am now getting 6-9 defenses per 24 hours.  My hope is that I can sneak into vibranium in the final minutes of pvp this season, but I'm not keeping my hopes up.

Now, I say the Mandible, because I saw that on PVP alone, and when it applied the ant pheromones on Nul, the Agent KEPT attacking me after every action I took with Nul. It was insane. I recharge, I get hit in the face. And this is WITHOUT the other piece of the set. This isn't the same follow up as the relentless rapier. Its a follow-up after every single action you take and it does proc on counters.   I still don't know if this is a bug or not, as the wording doesn't make it clear, but this piece, alone, owned me in a fight. and it hits hard after a few Opportunist debuffs. So for me, the Mandible is the way to go for on one thing, and honestly, if you did the research via the task with the gun, you can just use that to give the rest of the set the bonus and not care about that one.

MAA,3dq5fm,Drakon7,3,Sat Jul 18 10:42:48 2015 UTC,"Juggy is immune to psychic ATTACKS, not effects, so he can still be effected by Charm and what not. As of this moment, the only hero in the game who is mostly immune to the stuff that Enchantress and Kuurth can do is Blade, who's in general a pretty meh hero. If you really want Juggy to do some insane damage, buy the Manifesting EISO. That'll add a buff to his level 9 to make it so that all his next attacks are crits. Combine this with his Sky high attack power, and the fact that Mountain Crusher has deadly crits? I've seen that shit one shot even non-shielded foes.   The main problem right now, though, is the same problem we've been having in this game since the start of things. A certain powerful type of hero gets introduced, has a particular strategy that no one in the game currently has means to fight, and Playdom has to catch up by creating new heroes and updating old ones to fight them or introducing items that do the same thing in a Heroes stead.  One perfect example of this is both Phoenix and Rescue. Both heroes had their passives nerfed ages ago and then were recently buffed back up to their original effects. The reason for this is because back when they were major power houses, there was no way to stop Nix's constant revives or Rescues buff clear. They trumped everything. Now? Not so much with the amount of brutal strike in play as well as the power of Pesti-beast.  Best way to fight Kuurth, enchantress, or just about any main pvp team that's relying on the Disoiented and what not is to pull out the Maddening Method set if you got it, or at least the Manic De-Amplifyer. That takes care of most Delirium based effects. Otherwise, you're just going to have to deal until we get to the point where another hero is introduced who's capable of fighting off against them."

Now, mind you, I could be missing a team up or item set that could go really well with him and make him a rather scary threat (Lord knows, it's happen before), and I'm willing to bet the fact that I've not properly Iso'd the magic armor out isn't doing much favors for me either, but in general, Destroyer just simply lacks the ability to be a threat, especially when dealing with the likes of Nul and Kuurth in all fights once hit hit Vibranium.  As it is, Playdom's already working towards leveling out the Worthy so you can at least counter them (Magic Warding completely negates most of Nul's damage) and they're learning to put stuff in faster that'll counter those who are heavy in the meta."
MAA,3dq5fm,Pokeprof,3,Sat Jul 18 11:29:59 2015 UTC,Destroyer mostly needs someone who can apply flanked and maybe staggered to ensure that he hits.
MAA,3dq5fm,GigaToreador,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:39:26 2015 UTC,The issue with magic warding is you're either limited to a mediocre hero(Dr. Voodoo and Black Knight don't really cause me any issues ever in PvP) or an item that most people don't have access to.  Really all it would take to make the 'Worthy' less brutal is make their shit get removed by Scroll or any other debuff clear.
MAA,3dq5fm,GigaToreador,0,Sat Jul 18 17:33:51 2015 UTC,"Funny how think those would ""mediocre"""
MAA,3dq5fm,Pokeprof,0,Sat Jul 18 18:00:52 2015 UTC,"I donno, they've never really stood out to me very much when I use them in PvE.  Especially Black Knight, and any time I see them in PvP I destroy them."
MAA,3dq5fm,Pokeprof,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:25 2015 UTC,"Both of them are pretty good. Black Knight is pretty durable with his kit if you play him tank, but he's also capable of insane follow ups if you play him damage. The fact that he naturally tanks with out buffs or what not makes him pretty nice. Voodoo is a bit more of a one trick pony, being more about damage and dot effects, but he's actually EXTREMELY useful against the worthy thanks to the fact that all of his damage is magic and that's the main weakness of the Worthy right now.  As for Magic Warding being available otherwise, There's at least two weapons that give it out, with one of them being on the PVP spin not to long ago (Skeptic). Considering the fact that two of the Meta dominating heroes have most of their high damage being Magic, It's a good idea to find a way to shut that down. Being immune to Angolob is just a bonus."
MAA,3dq5fm,guiltfree_conscience,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:27:58 2015 UTC,"Agree to disagree on Black Knight.  I don't own him yet, and the times I've been forced to use him I've found him severely lacking.  And I never have any issue fighting him.  So you either were lucky enough to get it when it came out, or lucky enough to get it in a roulette?  Not exactly a reliable strategy then is it?"
MAA,3dq5fm,Asexyvirgin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:42:21 2015 UTC,"Nothing here is 100% reliable. Not even the Worthy are 100% infallible in pvp and can be stopped with the right weapons and team on the enemy side. What you have to do is adapt best you can and work against your foes as best you can and do your best to pick up as many weapons and heroes as possible, as you'll never know when they'll be able to win in pvp or fight off against a group boss."
MAA,3dq5fm,Pokeprof,0,Sat Jul 18 20:35:38 2015 UTC,Too bad he kinda sucks though?
MAA,3dq5fm,SaintHellion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:30:30 2015 UTC,"Juggy should have a strong healing factor, outside of that he is pretty straightforward for a relentless Punches people kinda guy."
MAA,3dq5fm,Bumbis69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:48:04 2015 UTC,What limits Juggs is his availability and weakness to remove buffs.
MAA,3dq5fm,SaintHellion,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:42:58 2015 UTC,What limits MOST heroes in the game is their weakness to remove buffs/debuffs. The fact that the effect is so wide spread is part of the reason why a lot of the heroes in the game simply aren't viable in pvp.
MAA,3dq6qc,SneezingPandaGG,5,Sat Jul 18 11:05:48 2015 UTC,I'll trade you my 20 uisos that I got for the fifth time in a row
MAA,3dq6qc,offpower,5,Sat Jul 18 11:18:40 2015 UTC,how rich do you have to be to think uiso is a much more needed resource than 10 gold? :o
MAA,3dq6qc,shinreialba,-1,Sat Jul 18 12:25:22 2015 UTC,"Not at all, because I have all the heroes and all the gear I ever needed + 100 gold stashed for whatever that just piles upo"
MAA,3dq6qc,HLChaves,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:39:23 2015 UTC,"So do I, got it twice during this SO, but I really wanted to get the U-Iso, we will need it a lot if we want the A-Isos."
MAA,3dq6qc,mc2157,4,Sat Jul 18 16:05:51 2015 UTC,Or with the gold you won you could just buy the a iso
MAA,3dooz0,Whack_the_mole,3,Sat Jul 18 00:16:49 2015 UTC,your training bay isnt in use! OCD intensifies
MAA,3dooz0,ProtoMan_XS,2,Sat Jul 18 00:36:10 2015 UTC,Scott Lang is using it at odd intervals ;)
MAA,3dooz0,fourthwallcrisis,2,Sat Jul 18 00:49:02 2015 UTC,"Urgh, yeah. They usually plan very well to ensure you still get adequate RNG for what battles appear and when, but sometimes they screw up a little and this can happen."
MAA,3dooz0,monkeymanD,2,Sat Jul 18 02:09:01 2015 UTC,You can always start the battle and lose it if you want to advance the deploys but still 3 bird the boss.
MAA,3dooz0,mc2157,2,Sat Jul 18 02:44:32 2015 UTC,"The uiso vs score penalty isn't worth it, when this bs happens you have to bite the bullet"
MAA,3dooz0,Drakon7,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:56:04 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty much deploy as sooon as it shows up.
MAA,3dooz0,Drakon7,3,Sat Jul 18 02:39:36 2015 UTC,Still happens.
MAA,3dooz0,shinreialba,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:03:23 2015 UTC,True.  Pisses me off every time.  Such poor design at times.
MAA,3dooz0,olaf_the_bold,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"this happened in three runs of this mission to me too, despite doing all deploys as soon as i can + highest difficulty mobs first, i know that feel"
MAA,3dp0zd,gwmclintock88,3,Sat Jul 18 02:06:31 2015 UTC,Wanted to see what the deal with that was as well?
MAA,3dp0zd,dcast323,3,Sat Jul 18 03:12:28 2015 UTC,This is my experience as well
MAA,3dp0zd,offpower,3,Sat Jul 18 04:47:19 2015 UTC,Sqme. Hasn't worked for me since the new SO if I'm remembering correctly.
MAA,3dp0zd,144Creations,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:50:07 2015 UTC,I half wonder if it's a joke as an arrow can't really be a boomerang.
MAA,3dp0zd,thecatdemon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:04:03 2015 UTC,"It's broken. Asterisk.  As someone who equipped the shield breaker iso to her L1 on u/SuplexLemon's suggestion, the boomerang arrow doesn't strike damage but the effects of the shield breaker take effect. On everyone."

MAA,3dnvea,ULTRON_XIII,5,Fri Jul 17 21:50:39 2015 UTC,Hanks had issues in every medium I know of. Though I haven't seen the movie yet.

MAA,3do0gz,swtdarkness,2,Fri Jul 17 22:33:29 2015 UTC,"Happens sometimes since about May/June. Not reliable enough to abuse it, though."
MAA,3do0gz,GigaToreador,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:43:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I keep running into this bug too. Whether straight damage or DoTs, even if 3 separate heroes attack the same enemy on their own turns, the character keeps coming back with about 200 HP. I had to Brutal Strike them to actually kill them off."
MAA,3dor5d,Sylthren,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:36:34 2015 UTC,not really.

MAA,3dohlx,vishalb777,3,Sat Jul 18 05:40:09 2015 UTC,It was an awesome movie.  My wife and I both loved it.
