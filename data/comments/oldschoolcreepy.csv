The insidious intimidation of blacks had proven so effective that Klan activity remained largely underground until the 1910s. In their early days Klan societies did not wear only one costume, and there is much stylistic variation documented in contemporary illustrations. The fabric pooling around the feet of this Klansman was, however, a common stylistic embellishment. Although impractical for walking, the long cut was designed for night-riding to fully drape the horseman's feet and stirrups, further emphasizing the grotesque and ghoulish. The presentation of the image in its decorated wrapper is perversely quaint.

It was at this old and creepy pastors house for one. Then all these people were speaking in tongues and writhing around like they were demon possessed.

oldschoolcreepy,2sv0cs,_circa84,1 point,Mon Jan 19 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"I'm quite sure what happened was that the original photograph's quality was reduced in order to be published in newspapers (like this) so that all versions of the image are actually more of a drawing of the photograph than a real photograph. I think that the image you posted is a touched up version of the image which was published in the newspapers during the war. I also think that the original photograph is probably lost to time, so that we will probably never see a real photographic version of the image."
oldschoolcreepy,2sv0cs,Witherkay,7,Mon Jan 19 18:39:56 2015 UTC,"I've always found that many pictures from that time frame and earlier are eery.    Film technology was still fairly infant then and subjects had to stand still for a long time for the long exposures required, even in lite studios.  Candid shots were challenging and expensive, hence weird posses also.   Many didn't smile either as smiling steady and accurately for a long time is not easy adding to the creepiness of old b&w pictures."
oldschoolcreepy,2sv0cs,_circa84,4,Tue Feb 24 08:14:41 2015 UTC,Film technology was better than you think in 1914. Snapshot cameras such as the Box Brownie had been around since 1900. Although 35mm hadn't taken a hold (actually due to WW1) they were way past standing for long exposures.
oldschoolcreepy,2sv0cs,2meterrichard,3,Mon Jan 19 01:47:41 2015 UTC,"You are correct, but new technologies didn't take hold of the market the way they do now   and many, especially during a world war, couldn't afford the better cameras and film.    It's easy to say that their was good technology, but in the 80's and 90's I had some cheaper modern and older cameras that required more than 1/60 exposure especially with no flash, which still easily can create a blur at that speed.  Look at many of our current smart phone camera's and the potato quality they can still easy create by a very small movement.  We don't know the camera, film type or lighting conditions of this image, but is safe to say a longer than our now standard  exposure was probably needed."

It's Me, Jesus"", where Jesus sought him out in order to make an appearance during the new millennium. Everyone in town was expecting Jesus to do something special for the occasion, however God refused to make an appearance on Earth. This left Jesus to decide to do something else for the millennium, as he desired to be liked by the populace once more.  However, things soon go awry and people prepare to crucify Jesus, again, and it is during this moment that Jesus realizes he shouldn't be so dependent on God to make him popular. Just then, God appears and decides to go through the millennium event with his son. He chooses to allow humanity to ask one question of him, however the question is stolen by Stan Marsh. He then leaves and promises to return in the year 4000.  In ""Probably"", a desperate Satan seeks God's aid in getting rid of Saddam Hussein, however he verbally berates the devil for not being able to deal with his own affairs. God then tells Satan that he should break up with both Saddam and Chris and appreciate himself more before getting in a relationship.

Chirgwin (14 December 1854– 17 November 1922) was a British music hall star billed as ""the White-Eyed Kaffir"", a black face minstrel act.  Chirgwin appeared in the first Royal Variety Command Performance (1912). He was noted for his unusual stage appearance and varied musical accomplishments, using a falsetto voice when singing, and playing the one-string ""Jap fiddle"".   Rather than using a fully blacked-up face as other blackface minstrels did, Chirgwin chose to adapt this by making one large white diamond over one eye. This meant that his stage character was only partly inside the blackface minstrel tradition, and was using the tradition in a somewhat ironical manner. And indeed his material included cockney material as well as straightforward blackface songs and sketches.

It's ridiculously funny because it's SO obvious that someone is hidden under the blanket, but I suppose the photographers of the day thought it was a clever way to make the kids behave for photos.

oldschoolcreepy,2iib70,Ghyllie,1 point,Wed Dec 17 07:26:29 2014 UTC,"A few tips in spotting dead people in old post mortem memento mori pictures:   Toes pointed forward. Dead feet (especially in shoes) will have an unnatural ""toes forward"" look if unsupported. Hands. If the subject is alive, hands will often show slightly blurry in old photographs due to minor movement. Very few deceased are photographed with fists, posed or otherwise. Dark discoloration in lips and fingers, later in shallows of the face. Sunken (deflated) eyes and nose (think Michael Jackson), later cheeks and temples. Gravity. Look for supports and wires around the neck if head is not laid down. A dead person can't lean."

He was also known as the Gray Man, the Werewolf of Wysteria, the Brooklyn Vampire, the Moon Maniac, and The Boogey Man,  A child rapist and cannibal, he boasted that he ""had children in every state"",  and at one time, stated the number was about 100. However, it is not known whether he was talking about rapes or cannibalization, less still whether he was telling the truth. He was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime. Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide, and he confessed to stabbing at least two other people. He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd, and was convicted and executed by electric chair.

In that time all sorts of movements and lighting changes can happen which will look just like this.   We're very spoiled by today's cameras/phones even compared to what photography was 30 years ago.

They were supplied by JC Penney for the tests ostensibly to test the resiliency of fabrics in the face of an atomic blast. The destruction of the fabric (and mannequins!) varied a lot depending on the fabrics, color, distance from blast, and all sorts of other things.   The National Atomic Testing Museum in Las Vegas has a book on display showing before and after photos of several mannequins involved in the tests; it's basically the Yearbook of the Damned.   Back in 2012 they had a rotating exhibit, Building Atomic Vegas, if I remember correctly, which is still accessible from their website, that included a REAL mannequin used in one of the tests. It is incredible to see, especially her eyes, which were glass, and shattered by the blast and fused back in place.   The whole mannequin testing program is fascinating, but especially the fact that if the mannequins survived the test, they were returned to JC Penney and reused in the stores!"

A revised version of the documentary that shifts the focus away from the story of the discovery of the family and includes the views of additional scientists was shown on NOVA on 14 November 2006.

oldschoolcreepy,2362f5,cobb__salad,7,Wed Apr 16 09:04:20 2014 UTC,"The ventriloquist in this picture is Jules Vernon. On Christmas day in 1920, Jules went completely blind in the middle of a show. But that didn’t stop him. But what did stop him was a speeding taxi that struck him down in 1937 killing him instantly at age 70."
oldschoolcreepy,2362f5,autowikibot,1 point,Wed Apr 16 09:04:44 2014 UTC,"Jules Vernon:       Jules Vernon (2 April 1867 – 17 May 1937) was born Walter Lester Pope Knyvette, in East India, as the son of an English officer in the army. Though educated at the University of Oxford, he achieved fame through becoming a famed vaudeville performer, specializing in ventriloquism.  Vernon’s act consisted of seven puppet characters who would engage in humorous dialogue with each other as well as Vernon. Although the dialogue undoubtedly provided a major element of the entertainment value in Vernon’s act, further entertainment was derived from his sheer ability to jump from character to character without a hitch. His characters included the Old Maid, who sang; George, who was afflicted with a terrible stutter; Nettie, George’s sister with a cleft lip; the Sailor; Joe, usually the main figure in the act; and Happy, a character who never spoke, but only laughed at the other characters’ jokes. All six of these figures (the seventh is not among the group) are on display at the Vent Haven Museum in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky.  As time passed, however, Vernon began to lose his eyesight, and, according to correspondence, he eventually went blind on Christmas morning, 25 December 1920, in the middle of a performance at the Orpheum Theater in Spokane, Washington. However, this setback did not hinder Vernon’s ventriloquist act in any way. He continued to travel and perform, never revealing to any of his audiences that he was blind. This was achieved by mounting his puppets together on a bench, which were connected to a thread running from the bench to the backstage, which was set up by Vernon’s wife before the show began. Vernon would follow the thread to the bench, and once in the proper place, knowing where each control was, he was able to perform as though he could in fact see. Using this method he continued successfully performing for years.

Essentially, this can be asserted as there is no hope in the cross or religion; everyone must face their deaths. This point is best described by Sandra L. Bertman, a commentator on the piece of art. As quoted by Sandra “…Religion, the saving grace of Christ, seems little more than a joke in this macabre representation where skeletons stand enclosed by barriers bearing the holy cross. Bruegel makes no allusions to the salvation of the soul. The viewer is encouraged and even forced to face death in all its ugliness and finality.” Pieter Bruegel wanted to make a point in this painting, a point that would not rest well with many in the church, a point that would not have been portrayed in a painting till after the reformation."" http://jamiller12.wordpress.com/2011/09/20/pieter-bruegels-the-triumph-of-death/  I thought the crosses made the painting creepier."

oldschoolcreepy,1z5ejr,mistermajik2000,5,Fri Feb 28 03:40:00 2014 UTC,"François de Loys, a Swiss oil geologist, led an expedition from 1917 to 1920 to search for petroleum in an area along the border between Colombia and Venezuela, primarily near Lake Maracaibo. The expedition was unsuccessful, and furthermore suffered greatly due to disease and skirmishes with natives; of the 20 members of de Loys' group, only four survived. According to de Loys' later report, in 1920, while camped near the Tarra River, two large creatures approached the group. Initially, de Loys thought they were bears, but then noted that they were monkey-like, holding onto shrubs and branches. The creatures – one male, one female – seemed angry, said de Loys, howling and gesturing, then defecating into their hands and flinging feces at the expedition. Fearing for their safety, the expedition shot and killed the female; the male then fled. De Loys and his companions recognised that they had encountered something unusual. The animal resembled a spider monkey, but was much larger: 1.57 m tall (compared to the largest spider monkeys, which are just over a metre tall). De Loys counted 32 teeth (most New World monkeys have 36 teeth), and noted that the creature had no tail. They posed the creature by seating it on a crate and propping a stick under its chin. After taking a single photograph, de Loys reported, they skinned the creature, intending to keep its hide and skull. Both items were later abandoned by the troubled expedition. According to other reports, more photographs were taken but were lost either in a flood or during the capsizing of the scientists' boat.  Excerpt from wiki."

This kept the memory of said person alive, and was even sometimes the only picture of them. 9 days might have been on the longer side of waiting for a photographer, but the photographer and the family try to make the deceased look as alive as possible, holding them up with a metal support and posing them in life-like positions."

She was the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Henry. She was married to German aristocrat Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, with whom she had four children: Princess Beatrix (born 1938), Princess Irene (born 1939), Princess Margriet (born 1943), and Princess Christina (born 1947). During the Second World War she lived in exile with her children in Ottawa, Canada. She became Queen of the Netherlands with her mother's abdication in 1948 and was succeeded by Queen Beatrix after her own abdication in 1980. During her reign both Indonesia (Dutch East Indies) (proclaimed in 1945, recognized in 1949) and Suriname in 1975 became independent from the Netherlands. Her birthday was celebrated annually as Koninginnedag (Queen's Day), until the accession of her grandson King Willem-Alexander to the throne, when it was replaced with Koningsdag (King's Day). Upon her death at the age of 94, she was the longest-lived former ruling monarch in the world. She is commemorated in space, in the name of the asteroid 816 Juliana.

oldschoolcreepy,1xrbpj,bluetaffy,2,Sat Feb 15 18:55:45 2014 UTC,"I asked, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENING. Or do you really think that people generally stand around a woman and reach for her when she is in her underwear? Please stop beating around the bush. I am genuinely curious on how you are rationalize that everyone else in this thread looks at things with an ""overt eye"". Especially considering the title is ""The name is Broomsticks.""  And that is without reading the small text which says ""Ring around Rosie, or Carol"" and ends with ""but if you don't want to play our way- take off your pants and go home.""  Just an FYI- the sexual imagery is purposeful.   You are entitled to your own opinion, but come one. You said we were being overt. So you must have some insight into this that we don't- unless you don't know what the word overt means."
oldschoolcreepy,1xrbpj,Renner1,-1,Sat Feb 15 20:53:44 2014 UTC,"unless you don't know what the word overt means.   Open to view or knowledge; not concealed or secret. That's the thing I'm talking about-- people are claiming that it's creepy because it ""obviously"" looks like a ""rape-y"" situation. I'm not seeing that.   that everyone else in this thread looks at things with an ""overt eye"".    Again, the ""it's obviously a rapish scenario"" attitude. You said this:    the sexual imagery is purposeful.     and sure, the advert does have a sexual imagery to it. Doesn't equate to ""looks like rape"", at least not because I don't see how ""sexual imagery=rape"", unless you're actively looking for a way to read ""it looks like rape"" into the image.   Especially considering the title is ""The name is Broomsticks.""   I don't understand why this has significance outside of it being part of the text on the image."

The film was written by Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou, and starred Brigitte Helm, Gustav Fröhlich, Alfred Abel and Rudolf Klein-Rogge. A silent film, it was produced in the Babelsberg Studios by UFA.  Metropolis is regarded as a pioneer work of science fiction movies, being the first feature length movie of the genre.  Made in Germany during the Weimar Period, Metropolis is set in a futuristic urban dystopia, and follows the attempts of Freder, the wealthy son of the city's ruler, and Maria, whose background is not fully explained in the film, to overcome the vast gulf separating the classes of their city. Metropolis was filmed in 1925, at a cost of approximately five million Reichsmarks. Thus, it was the most expensive film ever released up to that point.

You can see the sack, you can see the attempt at a face on it, but none of the two feels right. That's what creepy is, essentially, like a child going around singing/whistling - at night. Moreover, some otehr times they are not trying to ""imitate"" someone, some bad guy and so on, they just do things that they would consider scary. It usually gets better results than the vampire or the werewolf, I think. Sure, the sepia tint helps. I think that these are at least some of the reason for their creepiness"
