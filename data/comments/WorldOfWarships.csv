WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Skraelings,2,Tue Jul 21 15:28:12 2015 UTC,"Well, it will take out skill from playing CVs, since knowing how or when to use them will be useless and there's less tools available to you. But I know that that's what WG wants so it's likely to be headed that way anyway. Not that I really care, since I want to move away from CVs anyway due to all the hate and the fact that WG will most likely brick CVs, and most of this stuff is only relevant to CVs."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Skraelings,9,Tue Jul 21 15:36:20 2015 UTC,Skill is exploiting borders?  Odd.
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Skraelings,5,Tue Jul 21 16:26:00 2015 UTC,"Well, know what you can and can't do in situations is skill. So yes, by that it would be. This game in general has a huge lack of possible skill. There are very limited number of things you can do once your layout and match has been determined. These kinds of things enable a person to give themselves an advantage and knowing how to deal with them is also important."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,MaSaHoMaKyo,8,Tue Jul 21 16:40:42 2015 UTC,Knowing how to deal with someone doing that is important.  But treating knowing how to use borders yourself I wouldn't consider it a skill it's just being cheap.  And while not an exploit per say makes one look like a jackass.  I don't wall hump but I'm glad you showed me how to deal with people who do.
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Skraelings,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:02 2015 UTC,"If it's in the game it's fair to use it. Calling something ""cheap"" doesn't mean your opponents or teammates will see it the same way, so it's a self-defeating way to view it. I would highly recommend the writing at sirlin.net - his ""Playing to Win"" work offers some great ideas on attitude in gaming."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,syanda,3,Tue Jul 21 20:10:56 2015 UTC,"""I"" view it as cheap and it's clearly broken if WG are working on a fix.  It's not self defeating it won't hurt me one way or the other really.    I'm allowed to dislike the ""tactic"".  I will definitely check out that play to win writing.   Probably quite interesting.  Also I come from a decent skill level in wot (very decent).  So I'm not complaining about it because I'm terrible at these games either."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,syanda,11,Tue Jul 21 21:32:34 2015 UTC,"Just FYI - Hugging the map border is not an accepted game mechanic, and you should not be encouraging people to do so.  And we've got tentative authorization to reveal that testing for new preventative measures are underway and that the light at the end of the tunnel may the glowing eyes of a kraken."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,aberg858,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:27:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, but how that actually works is a different matter. Does it enable you to drop torpedoes close when a ship is at the map edge? If not then this is completely relevant. I don't care about the sliding part.  And how is it not an accepted game mechanic? If it wasn't it would've been changed during the INCREDIBLY long CBT since it was whined about almost every other day on all the forums. You can't have a game mechanic which is ""discouraged to be used"", but still exists. Either it's allowed and you can hug and encourage the usage of it all you want or it's not allowed and you either get punished for using it even once or it's impossible to do so. Having some kind of gray middleground where sometimes it's okay, but other times isn't just doesn't work in a game that tries to be PvP. For instance, at the end of CBT Gearing's guns were supposed to fire 12 shots a minute, but they were bugged and still fired 20, most people who had a Gearing knew that and used it - should those people have been encouraged to wait a few seconds extra on every shot?"
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,mindcopy,5,Tue Jul 21 15:35:36 2015 UTC,"Devs have agreed that it is a problem (i.e. not an accepted game mechanic) and will be changed extremely soon. Sources linked in previous post. I can't reveal how exactly it's going to change, but that part of your video is going to be completely obsolete."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,mindcopy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:38 2015 UTC,"If you say it's going to be completely obsolete then that means it will be possible to drop on someone who's close to the border. Remember, the point of the video is to show how to attack somebody that's hugging or close to the border, not how to survive longer while hugging it. And if it's obsolete it's obsolete, who cares. WG changes their minds on this kind of stuff so often you wouldn't be able to make a guide about anything if you wanted it to last.  I mean in the past few months CVs have had their torpedo bomber loadouts changed, torpedo spreads changed, manual torpedo dropping has been changed, arming distance was changed multiple times,  dive bomber bombing has been changed in accuracy and damage multiple times, how fighters work has been changed, there has been a commander skill update which changed everything and loadouts have been changed quite a lot. I accept that these changes will happen a lot and when they do I'll take a look at them and see what's what. Maybe the changes will make the video be a recommendation of ""just don't play CVs"".  Also, when devs agree that it's a problem it doesn't mean it's not an accepted game mechanic. It just means they want to change it. The way things are right now it's okay. You aren't cheating when you use it. I'll give you another issue that had cropped up in CBT: you know how almost no islands have large crevasses anymore? That's because you could hide CVs in them and be immune to torpedo attacks from like all 3 sides. These things were fixed incredibly quickly in silence.  Anyways, I'm glad you mentioned this in the comments though. Like I said: many people will view it unfavorably if you use these, so people should be aware of it.  Thank you."

WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,VSxTravesty,0,Tue Jul 21 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"Same for me, to a certain extent at least - I do perceive certain mechanics as cheesy and/or their existence as undesirable. I'll still use them if it helps me win if they're not officially disallowed. I'm also certain that more people using those mechanics usually leads to them getting changed more quickly, if they're that much of a problem, so publicizing all of them is something that everyone who dislikes them should want.   It's a difference in mindset - some people are able to maximize their fun just by playing, others derive most of their fun by winning as efficiently as possible. Being of the latter group I find ""house rules"" and all the ""e-honor"" drama that comes with it to be rather ridiculous."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,flamuchz,2,Tue Jul 21 17:10:55 2015 UTC,"I really appreciate this guide as I am currently grinding the tier 6 US CV. I thought I was pretty hot stuff but I learned quite a bit from the video.    I think it sucks that you can abuse the borders like it is demonstrated in the video, and I look forward to WG changing it. Some people seem to almost want to blame OP for the current border mechanics, but I am glad I learned about it and options I have to counter a CV that plays that way.     Since I am finally in a CV that can keep up with other ships I stay with the bulk of the fleet or just slightly behind.  Personally I would feel scummy for taking advantage of those border mechanics, but I am glad that I am more aware of them. Thank you for making this guide."

If you can't see any planes on the minimap in the direction of the icon then they are outside the map. Illustrative screenshot."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Jimqi,4,Tue Jul 21 22:02:07 2015 UTC,"The age old excuse of exploiters: ""The devs know about and have done nothing to fix it so its legit.""  I have been hearing that since Ultima Online.  It was rubbish then and its rubbish seventeen years later."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,flamuchz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:55 2015 UTC,"It is a PvP game. If somebody uses it, and the very strong players at high tiers absolutely do in CV vs CV then you just have to know how to deal with it and how to use it yourself, because you'll be at a giant disadvantage. If you just ""play for fun"" where you're satisfied with not doing your absolute best then I can completely understand your attitude, but there are a whole bunch of people who want to play their absolute best and do everything they can. Such unintended mechanics pop up eventually in most games, in some they stay around and are used. Eg Quake or Enemy Territory or Counter Strike, in others they are eventually removed, but there are no games that work by trying to shame people with ""I disagree with this tactic being possible so I consider it cheating!""  The developers have to do something about it, otherwise there will be people who use it. On top of that these things are relatively minor and just add to the depth of playing carriers making you able to utilize a little more skill than normal."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,DetroitHustlesHarder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:36:50 2015 UTC,"""The developers have to do something about it, otherwise there will be people who use it.""    Yes, but you are actually encouraging the exploits use.  And yes, people play to win at all costs.   You are arguing that you are just in going outside of the play field so that you can't be detected or shot at by enemy players.   Just think about that. Think about fair play in gaming.  So, if an exploit pops up for players to kill your planes and carrier without you being able to fight back, I expect you to encourage it.  Because if you don't,  you are not only an exploiter but a hypocrite."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,flamuchz,2,Tue Jul 21 18:47:33 2015 UTC,"I'm going into an area of the map where the planes themselves CAN go to. They can't keep going indefinitely away from the map, they just go a bit outside. This just makes them not pop up on the map. You can still see them on your HUD and put that together with not seeing planes and you know where they are instantly.  Also, you can't actually go outside the map with your ship, nor does it make you take less damage. It's just that you can't do torpedo bomber drops near the border. Literally anyone who goes near a border is in a state like that. This means that the moment you spawn on the Ocean map you would already be ""exploiting"" this mechanic since there are spawnpoints there which are literally on the border.  So considering it's a location that WG makes you spawn at themselves I would imagine that they are fully aware of how it works.  Nothing what I showed doesn't have a counter. Literally everything I showed in this can be played around. I could've shown you stuff like how to detect people's loadouts without them knowing about it or how to make yourself immune to torpedo bomber attacks by using the map, but I didn't. Because those things literally do NOT have a counter. On top of that the latter is clearly unintended because WG actively changes maps to remove such locations. And they've been doing that for a while.  In the video I clearly showed how to hug the map edge and how to combat it, how to hug the corner and how to combat it. I showed how to fly outside the map but due to issues I couldn't put how to deal with it into the video. I added it as a comment with an image description.  Another instance of mechanics that were unintended: permanent smoke coverage from one DD. WG did change it and it caused massive nerfs to destroyers, yet they still did it knowing that full well. And that change balance wise screwed up way more than anything they will do to the border, yet the border issue has been known and around for longer than the smoke issue."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Armagetiton,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:55:21 2015 UTC,"I love it. You are actually acting like this is a balance issue and a dev problem.  Absolutely classic.  The same excuse given in every mmo since the first.   And if a ""game mechanic"" comes up that allows someone to blink to the other side of the map and torp your carrier, you would come on reddit and tell them how to do it and encourage them to do it since it helps them win, right?   Right?"
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,DetroitHustlesHarder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:14:04 2015 UTC,"No, I would submit a bug report and expect the developers to deal with this issue swiftly since that is a huge gamebreaking issue. If the developers do not find that it's a big enough deal I'll deal with it myself somehow by playing another game or similar. I just don't think border hugging is a big of enough of an issue to treat it like that.  That's the thing, the magnitude of the bugs you mention here is somethinng that would get fixed ASAP. WG does that."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,flamuchz,3,Tue Jul 21 21:59:59 2015 UTC,"This kinda sums up why the very best games I've ever played has been when neither side has any carriers.   Such faceroll, unavoidable damage from complete safety."

WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Jimqi,2,Tue Jul 21 18:33:18 2015 UTC,Shows how simple and easy it is to deliver the damage. A toddler on a CV can demolish fantastic cruiser and bb players with ease.
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,flamuchz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:12 2015 UTC,Wait what I've play about equal numbers of cruiser and cv games with 60%+ win rate and a brain dead toddler can dodge cvs in a cruiser t6 and above.
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Jimqi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"You can't dodge manual-dropped torps in high tiers on a cruiser. It doesn't matter how early you start turning or evading, the CV will just wait until he sees you turn and drop em in at 500m where you can do nothing.  Consistently see cruiser players I know are good get oneshot or lose 60-80% of their hp to torp attacks. Lets not even talk about high tier bb's trying to evade...  Worst is the CV players with a brain that bait out the cruiser skill, pull back and then come over once it's on cd. It's just faceroll.  Of course if we're talking about CV players who auto-drop then anyone can dodge them, but those don't even count because it's the equivalent of a dd missing all his torps from 1km on a bb."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,flamuchz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:55:56 2015 UTC,Most higher tier CA/CL's have... what's it called... AA? Even poor AA is enough to jack up the torp spread and if you're a cruiser you CAN avoid the majority of a torp drop. Now a skilled CV player w/ multiple torp drops... you might be stuck. But that's just how it is.
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Jimqi,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:07 2015 UTC,"Now a skilled CV player w/ multiple torp drops...   It's literally point and click from an overhead view, how is it skilled? It's the most basic shit ever, which is why it's ridiculous how strong it is. Anyone with even the most basic experience of RTS games would laugh at the notion of multi torp drops being considered skilled."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,16dots,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:12:41 2015 UTC,"It's literally point and click from an overhead view, how is it skilled?   I could make the same argument against any other ship. You're literally pointing and clicking at other ships to deal damage, wow.  In a CV you first need to find the best approach then find the best drop, and yes, you point and click where to do this just like any other ship. The difference between CVs and other ships however is that you need to do this with multiple units.   Finding the best approach and drop requires thinking ahead of your opponent and anticipating how he will turn to avoid you, and while doing this with multiple units there's a good deal of multitasking involved. You only have a few seconds to make your decision and if you're too late you'll end up with shredded planes in the higher tiers while doing no damage.   Also personally I don't participate in the map border stuff, instead I tactically choose a position that'll get me as close to the enemy as possible without being seen which is another layer of skill and multitasking. This usually involves me running with the fleet and finding a nearby island to hug, I also use it as bait against players trying to rush to the other side of the island to get an angle on me. I do this so that my planes can return, rearm and get back out there much more quickly... if I were hugging borders, I'd probably be doing 1/3rd the amount of runs I perform."
WorldOfWarships,3e2ta8,Aegeus,-3,Tue Jul 21 22:01:52 2015 UTC,"It's point and click if it's auto-dropping, which will hit nearly nothing... on a cruiser that's not moving. If a cruiser is moving, it will still hit nearly nothing. It's not unless you're using manual drops that you have any chance of hitting anything. Cruisers move fast, so timing can be tough. Cruisers can stop/change speed quickly. Gotta factor that in as well. And also... cruisers (even top tier ones) can turn on a DIME so that they can avoid most if not ALL torps that are dropped.    Cruisers have all of the defenses in the WORLD against CV's. You have visibility on planes from 8-10k+ out. You can tell both visually as well as on the mini map if planes are coming your way. Other than destroyers, you are the most maneuverable ships in the world. Cruisers have better AA than any other ship in the game, especially USN ships. Sure, if you get singled out by a CV you're going to have a rough time, but you CAN survive it and usually fairly consistently. And as a note... cruisers are waaayyyyy down on the ships that CV's want to take on for the above reasons.    And as for skilled cv players w/ multiple torp drops... it DOES take skill to do multiple torp drops from different angles (effectively) WELL on a moving target that has the potential (from a skilled cruiser captain, anyways) to avoid it or defend against it in any number of the ways mentioned above.    If you feel helpless against CV's... maybe you need to spend some more time at your current tier and get a bit more in tune with your ship."

I remember the grind was terribly hard when WoT still didn't have physics. Credits wise, it's possible to get some good amount of credits in a battle which shaves off quite a bit of it.  Then again, it's been a while and having premium time may have made it seemed easier to grind.  Also the fact that we only have 2 nations released and if we ground all the way up to tier 10 in a short amount of time, I'd say there wouldn't be much of an end game this early on. :P"

Credits wise, it's possible to get some good amount of credits in a battle which shaves off quite a bit of it.   No it wasn't. In fact physics changed nothing at all in terms of economy. What changed was gameplay-wise.  7.2 (straight economy changes), 8.1 (gold ammo for credits) and 8.6 with the sweeping repair+ammo cost changes are some of the patches that made the grind what it is today.  Imo, it is slower today to grind to t10 than it was at release and ~3x slower than in beta, however it's always been relatively quick to reach t10 (in terms of absolute battles).  e: cleaned up stuff, dropped some links because why not."

The earnings per match seems much more variable in Warships, and if you can do well you can advance quickly. I also haven't been hugely crunched for credits, despite advancing 2-4 lines simultaneously. I expect that will change once I hit tier 9, but that's not different from Tanks.  Maybe you should stop grinding credits in a tier 1."

WorldOfWarships,3e1yy3,qazzq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it seems the problem is that you're stuck grinding credits in a subpar ship.  On Minekaze I average well over 100k per match. Game's reward system rewards performance over participation, and as a result having a subpar vessel really hits you hard.  I am experiencing the same problem you are on Furutaka right now. But I feel that it's an issue of ship balance more than anything, which is acceptable in early beta stages. This game has been in open beta only for a short time after all.  Hopefully this will be addressed before proper release."
WorldOfWarships,3e1yy3,Pesusieni,2,Tue Jul 21 16:28:29 2015 UTC,"If you want to progress to the higher tiers you are, by necessity, spending some battles in sub par ships.  Ofc, grinding the silver in the Atlanta would be faster, but then I either have ti spend dubloons to convert the free exp or I must put this time ON TOP of the time I use to actually unlock the Fubuki, which I did.  In WoT I do NOT need to grind the extra silvers on a prem tank, I already have them when grinding the T-43 (due to rewards for missions, being able to reuse all the equipment for just a few gold and whatnot), that is the difference."
WorldOfWarships,3e1yy3,Mike_Prowe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:17 2015 UTC,"You're missing my point. Source of the problem we're talking about lies not so much in the amount of grind as in balance issues at certain ships.  If you get better combat results once ships are (hopefully) more balanced, you'll get more rewards per battle on average and grind amount needed will go down."
WorldOfWarships,3e1yy3,JDintheD,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"With the 150k per match you stated for for WoWs, you'd need roughly 87 matches to get enough silver for the T8 in question.   Someone threw around 70k per match for WoT, which mean that you'd have the silver for the T8 tank in 41 matches.  Obviously these numbers are highly dependant on actual income. If WoT was at 50k per match and WoWs was at 250k, the latter would be the faster grind. So, what are reasonable numbers for the average income per match at T7 [with and without premium units]."
WorldOfWarships,3e1yy3,Skraelings,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:35 2015 UTC,"Wot today is much easier, the amount of missions and specials money is no issue in wot anymore,and i used to shoot alot of prem.  But when wot started out grinding cash was terrible you needed 6 million cash and at tier 9 making cash was near impossible really only good effective way was to get a tier 8 prem and then you could make about 50k profit on average,which meant you needed over a 100 games to get the cash together.  Wows atm in my eyes is very easy when it comes to the grind atm."

As a Software Developer however I would really like to ask you to rethink the Sumome Welcome Mat you are using.   This thing is probably going to hurt the site more than it helps.   Asking for a Email address as the first thing before the user has any chance to see anything of your site is not a good user experience. Which is even made worse since this thing is so slow to load that the site rendered fully and was displayed fully for a few seconds before the Welcome Mat Pushed itself over the content. I was already in the middle of reading the Post when this thing interrupted me. I just clicked it away, but in my experience at least some of the users that would be interested in the Site are just going to close the tab and never return and the rest are just going to click this thing away.

WorldOfWarships,3e1w23,DrOwnz,2,Tue Jul 21 10:43:52 2015 UTC,"so you got my lil review on your guide  here are some additions:  AA: turn off your AA in general, but don't forget to turn it on when you're spotted by AC, an turn it off when they are at your conclement border  active AA fire incraeases your visibility by 4km, as soon as you shut your AA fire visibility is back to normal  firing guns of 127mm will increase your visibilty by about 4kms for 20 seconds!  also your visibility is increased by fire...  one other thing about tactics:  approahing a BB up front is a nice way to kill him, either he will turn and try to broadside you... he will not hit you! just trust in that, also if he hits... he probably has AP loaded  so engine boost! and run toards him, run out of his gun angle and torps!  but be sure of your surroundings!  this is a general advice that I miss, knowing your surroundings, checking hat enemieys you're up against, the whole point situational awareness could be added a bit more"
WorldOfWarships,3e1w23,DrOwnz,6,Tue Jul 21 09:57:33 2015 UTC,"ok I will edit this post I fI find stuff:  plz don't get me wrong I love the idea, I like the presentation but will comment on the content inside   Across all tech trees and nations the role of the destroyer is mainly scouting.    Scouting is a side-task and a side effect   For US destroyers up to tier 9 (Fletcher) the ratio is reversed: US destroyers can and generally will be detected before their torpedoes are in range.   exclude high tier american DDs, from benson up american DDs can fire torps further than their concleament   Most destroyers of the US line up to the tier 9 Fletcher have short range torpedoes.    see before, set it to Benson is ok   you have to ambush your target as you can’t launch “from stealth”;    no need to ambush always, you can also go yolo   you can’t launch your torpedoes outside the detection range of the ship you are targeting.   which is a horrible tactic as you will hit like 1 torpdo on a stuipid enemy once in a blue moon   As you progress through the Japanese tech tree you will notice a significant increase in the time it takes you to load your torpedoes.   also put this sentence to USN DDs or put it in general it's a very important element for both nations   Tier 2 Aiming Expert – Boost that turn rate on your guns even further   either torpedo tubes CD reduce (even as USN DD your torpedos are your most poerful weapons, and cmon, you don't need faster turrets, that's like nothing in increase  or fire prevention  as you will often be in gnfights and ppl always fire HE on you it might be worth thinking about it   Tier 3 Superintendant – More smoke!   y smoke is important and good but don't overestimate it.. as you're firing your guns you will often be visible in smoke, the torpedo acquistion range will boost your ability to scout and also help when fighting other DDs at medium range   Tier 4 Last Stand – The last thing you need in a DD is to be dead in the water, this skill with help you stay alive   there is no other choice...    Tier 5 Jack Of All Trades – Reduces reload time on the consumables so you can create smoke screens more often   concealment! all the way... don't bother that much with smoke especially for high tier USN DDs that can fire further than beeing detected while firing  along the leftover points I would take some personal preferences, I prefer the incrasesd range and lowered reload time for the guns   Main Battery Mod 2 – Increases DPS and turn rate   not sure ... will have to look it up but isn't this a DPS loss? it increases turnrate but increases your reload time you should pick the increased acc, espeially for highter tier DDs  it seems like you din't play that many USN DDs as you did not include all 6 upgrade slots   Propulsion Mod 2 – I already have a rudder shift time of 2.8 seconds so getting a 20% reduction on that doesn’t really help, getting up to full speed faster does, so that’s why I picked Prop Mod 2   my personal preference is always about rudder shift time, especially with the engine boost skill   their powerful secondary armament won’t hit you.   poweful secondaries? plz secondaries are nothing more than annoying if you approah to kill a BB they will hit yo maybe once or twice before you have killed it  anyway the advice for offensive smokescreen is good   Keep in mind that the enemy ships can still guess your position so keep zigzagging to reduce their chances to hit you.   nah don't after popping smokescreen be sure to be unseen and run! change your facing once and then keep running, you want speed, you can change your direction if you get hit but any hit while undetected is probably due to dispersion or shotgun spray and pray fire... zigzagging doesn't help there, speed and outrange helps  ok lunch time, I'm done here  my personal favs are  of course the both T5s and the T9 USN Fletcher as well as the Hatsuhara (show them lousy USN DD captains how to gun!--- well only if you know that you can :P)"

WorldOfWarships,3e1w23,DrOwnz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:59:27 2015 UTC,"which is a horrible tactic as you will hit like 1 torpdo on a stuipid enemy once in a blue moon   Not if you're stealthed and fire in a proper spread with spreading to proper lead (extending or shortening based on ships current heading; if parrelel then always fire shorter, if perpindicular fire further)  CV's often just move in 1 heading for a minute or 2 at a time as long as you remain undetected. 2 DDs can sneak in, fire off tight torps right on target, and pull away and count on a likely kill against a CV who's usually too engaged in controlling aircraft and responding to enemy air   BB's aren't too hard to hit either, again, as long as you set the spread right and they don't know to prepare for it properly"
WorldOfWarships,3e1w23,DrOwnz,2,Tue Jul 21 21:32:51 2015 UTC,"1 more thing, I really love those circles, maybe you can take your time and put a bit effort in it to have that for each DD?  maybe even regarding the captains skill and the upgrade (upgrade is -10%) (or even the camou)  or maybe even do that for gun range vs. visibilty while firing for the ships that are affected by it (should be Sims with upgrades/captain skills, fletcher and gearing)"
WorldOfWarships,3e1w23,CrescentRedRWBYg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:05:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting idea. That would make it a pretty picture heavy post.  Question though: do things like concealment expert, camo and camo equipment stack?  So for the Nicholas for example:  Concealment: 6.7 km Camo buffs: Conceal expert (10%) + camo texture (3%)  End result: 6.7 - 670 (10%) - 201 (3%) = 5.82 km  OR End result: 6.7 - 670 (10%) = 6.03 - (3% of 6.03) = 5.84 km?  For this DD it wouldn't be that much of a diff, but for high tier which get the camo equipment it can get significant.  Thoughts?"

WorldOfWarships,3e1w23,fstd,2,Tue Jul 21 10:54:35 2015 UTC,"hmm those pics are getting a bit do confusing,  maybe limit it to:  concealment  max torp range max gun range (including all the upgrades... and captain skills available for that tier)  also maybe you have an option to have it in some kind of ""spoiler"" part, so that a reader can choose to see the pictures or not?"

WorldOfWarships,3e1w23,MicMan42,2,Tue Jul 21 17:50:49 2015 UTC,"Guess I'll chime in:    I wouldn't say the main role is scouting; if anything that belongs to aircraft. In any case, DDs are pretty much the only things that remain hidden in this game. Everything else reveals it's position at long range, or as soon as they fire, no real need to scout. In this game, scouting is basically limited to finding the DDs and CVs, both of which are more the job of aircraft than DDs.  It might be useful to list the DDs which are capable of firing while invisible and the range at which they can do so; granted, it's not super useful to do so, for various reasons, but it would be handy to have as reference; the chart already exists somewhere in this subreddit. Situational awareness could be expanded with some more specific examples of what to watch out for... though, I can't actually think of many good examples right now. Good one might be to watch the aircraft on the minimap. You can follow them back to the CV, for example. Also, aircraft will often fly on a straight trajectory, so you need to watch the minimap and make sure you stay out of their path if they're coming towards you, or else they will spot you.  You say that from T4 up, IJN DDs can torp undetected; That's actually true for the entire line, both Umikaze and Wakatake have torp ranges exceeding their detection range.  You should note that the big jump in torp reload speed happens going from Minekaze to Mutsuki. That's where the playstyle shifts and spamming is no longer an option. Mutsuki is the first one where you really have to be careful about picking your shots. The increase on the US line is more linear.  I recommend you put reload times instead of RoF; I feel it's more illustrative to say you go from a 43 second reload to a 150 second (2.5 minute) reload.  Aiming expert is only useful for IJN DDs, who have shit turret traverse. Absolutely not worth it for US DDs, which already have very fast turning guns.  A range boost for USN DDs is not always useful. Some of the guns have very long hangtime, and aren't very practical at their stock maximum range, much less at 1.2 times that range; advanced fire training wouldn't be my first pick.  Using a smokescreen to approach your target gives away your location; they may not be able to shoot at you, but they'll know you're there, which gives BBs a huge head start on turning. Also, the way the smoke comes out means you can't really go straight in at max speed and still be undetected. This one is really only useful for US DDs to close to torp range.  Should probably make some sort of note regarding the shift in playstyle that occurs around T6. It's very dramatic and catches a lot of people off guard. In general, engagement ranges become much greater; this has huge implications for both IJN and USN DDs."

WorldOfWarships,3e3xw4,MrBallalicious,2,Tue Jul 21 19:41:31 2015 UTC,"You can use your doubloons for converting XP on elited ships into Free XP, which can be used on any ship. In addition, you can also use your doubloons to purchase premium ships (not many at 1250, though) and also convert the doubloons into silver.    Honestly, and don't take this wrong, you sound like a new player and as a general rule I would recommend that you NOT spend any of your doubloons on ANY ships under Tier 5. Sub-tier 5 ships are fairly easy to attain naturally and by that point you'll have a better understanding of the game and just how valuable those doubloons really are.    The ships that are considered good moneymakers in the lower tiers of WoWS currently are the USN St. Louis cruiser and the Tier 2 Umikaze IJN DD. Research everything on those ships and research the ship on the tier above it and that will make those ships elite, which will earn more silver/xp every round.    Alternately, owning a premium ship (Murmansk comes to mind, AWESOME ship) or purchasing premium time always helps tremendously as well. The only thing about the Murmansk is that the captain is not transferrable and all the XP you generate off of it (except the free xp) will need to be converted using doubloons.    Hope that helps you get started! Have fun!"

WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,fstd,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:44 2015 UTC,But there aren't any premium CVs yet. Plus you could easily end up on the wrong side of a CV alpha strike where two carriers throw up to 6 squads of TBs and 8 squads of DBs at you. Then it's up to your team whether you survive.
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,Scaevus,2,Tue Jul 21 20:12:52 2015 UTC,Can you explain the concept of silver grinding to me. Im new to the game. I assume people are using premium ships to grind out silver stars because you get more on premium ships. But where Im stuck is what do you do with these silver stars if you cant spend them on premium ships?
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,Sports_fan_man,5,Tue Jul 21 17:55:57 2015 UTC,"In higher tiers, service costs (repairing, ammo, etc) at the end of the game keep increasing with the ships. At one point, the profit margin becomes increasingly smaller. Arguably, at TierX you'll be losing money in general even on normal games.  ""Silver Grinding"" is going on smaller ships at which profits are constant and reliable, and appreciable. Therefore earning money for your bigger ships. Premium ship have a bonus to the amount of XP and Money they get, much like you would have on every ship with Premium on. Therefore, when you're further down the tiers, using a premium ship is a good way to ""grind silver"". There's also Captain training shenanigans you can do with them as well. Long story short, captains don't need to be retrained on prem ships, and prem ships earn more XP, meaning captain gets more XP, then goes back to his other ship without the retraining."
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,KeimaKatsuragi,2,Tue Jul 21 18:00:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you, much appreciated"
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,Sports_fan_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:32 2015 UTC,"THIS. Basically, you can play Tier 5 ships and below to make more money due to lower repair costs to pay for higher tier ship play that gets REALLY expensive (think like $150k+ repair cost for sinking a tier X ship PER battle)"
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,DetroitHustlesHarder,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:13:46 2015 UTC,"T8 BB Amagi. 110k + 22.5k for the Repair 2.  If i play good, I got 400k+ with premium member"
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,DetroitHustlesHarder,3,Tue Jul 21 22:34:44 2015 UTC,"Murmansk = #1, my friend. Umikaze/Minekaze. St. Louis. Lowest 2 tiers of IJN Cruisers without all-bomber loadouts (though this takes longer per match)"
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,Foxcat420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:42 2015 UTC,Or the ship Murmansk is based on with double X3 torp launchers: http://imgur.com/a/nPqnr
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,DetroitHustlesHarder,2,Tue Jul 21 20:10:10 2015 UTC,"The Murmansk is an IMPROVEMENT upon the Omaha. Longer range on your mains and that precious torpedo system you mentioned? The Murmansk goes 2.5k further and does 2.5k more damage per torp. Have fun flipping your ship around to use the other side while you take fire, my friend. And if you're wagging your tail to fire them at your assailant? You're already running."
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,Foxcat420,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"Omaha B shoots 6 per side, I'll take 12 torpedoes over 6 even if they are slightly inferior."

My understanding is the Murmansk is basically the Omaha C hull with better torps?   About how much money do you pull in a game?"
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,DeleRT83,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:01:44 2015 UTC,"To be completely fair, just have 1 or 2 IJN destroyers. Never lost any silver on those and am making around 100-150k on average (tier 4-8).  I do think a Murmansk is enough to grind any silver you need in the game. Its just one hell of a money maker."
WorldOfWarships,3e3fmg,Frisian89,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:58:25 2015 UTC,Murmansk is a silver magnet. Deals great damage and good return
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,RaulHambriento,19,Mon Jul 20 20:49:05 2015 UTC,You'd probably enjoy Shipbucket then...

WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,ibly31,4,Mon Jul 20 21:22:26 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot. It started as a way to kill time but I'm pretty happy with the results.
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,Kiviar,7,Mon Jul 20 23:15:03 2015 UTC,These look awesome! Any chance at a Yamato and a Montana/Iowa?
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,TRLegacy,5,Mon Jul 20 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! The longer ships are a little more difficult because it can be kinda hard to get a good profile view to work from, but I don't see why not. I originally started these as something to do while waiting for games to wrap up, and I wanted to do at least one ship of each type from each nation."
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,MayIReiterate,5,Mon Jul 20 21:04:40 2015 UTC,"Try avoiding using black outlines as much as possible, instead use more shading. It will be a little more difficult, especially considering the limited palette, but you will end up with a much richer looking picture. On curves and angles using some intermediate colours to manually anti-alias will also greatly improve the look.  But other than that pretty decent."
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,BrandCAG,4,Tue Jul 21 00:09:51 2015 UTC,"Well, I obviously wasn't going for a particularly realistic look. I wanted to keep as few shades involved as possible. I like the more definite edges given by the black lines anyways. Thanks for the feedback though."

WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,bs1110101,2,Tue Jul 21 00:15:00 2015 UTC,You say that like it was easy... they look great! I hope you do more!
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,aethertech,5,Mon Jul 20 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it wasn't too tough. While I was waiting for matches to end I would pull up one of the ships in my port and work on it. The toughest part is making sure all the dimensions remain consistent - each pixel is about .75 meters, but I early on I kept getting sucked into the trap of trying to add too much detail, and things would start to mismatch. For example, on the Atago I was working from both the bow and stern towards amidships, and wound up having no space for the superstructure. I definitely will do some more, I want to eventually get at least one type of ship class for each nation."
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,robg485,2,Mon Jul 20 23:10:16 2015 UTC,Cool stuff!  Any chance of a camo?
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,robg485,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:17 2015 UTC,"Well, I did these couple as a starting test run, so I was mainly focused on getting the base colors right for each nation (hence why Atago is so vanilla). I could do camo'd versions though."
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,robg485,2,Mon Jul 20 23:40:06 2015 UTC,Can you make the Kawachi like that? I want to make it my icon for World of Warships.
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,Sir_Casem_III,4,Tue Jul 21 02:02:22 2015 UTC,"Sure thing! Odd choice seeing as most people hate the Kawachi, lol. It might take me till tomorrow though."
WorldOfWarships,3dzns2,Thighbone,2,Tue Jul 21 02:16:58 2015 UTC,"I do hate it, but it looks cool. Really it's only problems are that it it cant hit crap for some reason, and that the match maker seems to hate it."

WorldOfWarships,3e19e5,AnIh,4,Tue Jul 21 15:34:23 2015 UTC,"First of all, ""She."" Ships are considered feminine by most navies. If wherever you call home traditionally refers to them in the masculine then by all means continue to do so. I just find it unlikely.  Second, the Atlanta has insane damage output, critical potential, and fire potential. She pays for this with short range and no armor. Destroyers are obliterated, cruisers face a difficult fight depending on the circumstances, and battleships are likely to be set completely ablaze unless they alpha her immediately off grid. The Atlanta lacks the large damage hits that heavy cruisers and battleships can bring about but has a very impressive damage output over time, especially when fires are considered. She also has quite good AA, though that isn't unique to her by any means.  She is a ship with very distinct strengths and weaknesses. All in all, a well designed and balanced ship. I passionately disagree with anybody who says the ship either sucks or is OP as quite honestly it is neither of those things."
