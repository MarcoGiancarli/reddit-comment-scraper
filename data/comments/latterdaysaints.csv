latterdaysaints,3e2sfo,everything_is_free,2,Tue Jul 21 14:54:12 2015 UTC,Love it.  So many steps in the right direction :).  1 and 6 will shock you (or in other words I liked those ones particularly).
latterdaysaints,3e2sfo,Gnolaum,2,Tue Jul 21 18:22:38 2015 UTC,"I loved #1. I got through an interesting educational point in my life with being rooted firmly in a Christ-centered testimony.   EVERYTHING has to tie back to Jesus Christ being the Savior somehow. If that is your focus, you can't go wrong.   My method is to hit the pause button on things I don't fully understand until I figure it out."

Sometimes things are slow, sometimes there's a bunch to discuss. I don't think there's any crazy reason why it's slow today."

latterdaysaints,3e42wo,kayejazz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:22:51 2015 UTC,"There's actually been 9, but one of them was deleted by the user.  You'll find that things go in a kind of cyclic nature here. We'll have some days where there are a lot of submissions and some where there aren't. We kind of have a niche here, so we don't see the same amount of traffic as other, larger (and broader) subs.  As a mod, I'll take the occasional quiet day."
latterdaysaints,3e42wo,excathmomo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:52:22 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Thanks.   In the last 24 hours, the exmo sub has had 142 submissions, almost 16 times more than the 9 submitted here in the same time period.  (So the exmo sub has 158 subscribers per submission compared to 600 subscribers per submission here).  They are more active, and I wonder why.  Maybe their negativity about the church flows more quickly than the positivity here."
latterdaysaints,3e42wo,excathmomo,2,Tue Jul 21 21:01:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's negativity.  I think that there is a new sense of freedom on r/exmo that many users feel.  We no longer feel like we have to self sensor.  For many of us exmos-we go to there to heal, vent, share, and support others.  And we can only truly heal after being completely authentic- the good, the bad, and the ugly. If we only kept our posts ""positive"" then none of us would heal.  We are each on very deep and personal journeys and r/exmo has been extremely helpful.  There is a great group of people over at r/exmo."

If we were to try to claim something about numbers, it would kind of fall flat.  I subscribe to several niche subs. For instance, /r/yawriters has about 3000 subscribers and usually gets less than 5 submissions per day. Traffic just is slower in smaller subs. But the communities of smaller subs can be really robust and diverse.   If you would like to see more submissions and discussion here, it's something you can help with. Find good content.

latterdaysaints,3e42wo,iwasazombie,3,Tue Jul 21 21:16:38 2015 UTC,The higher activity level in the exmo sub can easily be explained by the fact that most junior high schools are on summer vacation.

It can be so frustrating for people who haven't felt that yet, and it definitely seems to come easier to some than others. It is always special though.   Keep being consistent! And write some things down from this experience. I promise that you will forget the smaller details.   Anyway, super happy for you!!"
latterdaysaints,3e0otz,willburshoe,3,Tue Jul 21 02:28:48 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing and reminding me how exciting it is to feel a budding testimony grow.

latterdaysaints,3e0otz,mouthsmasher,3,Tue Jul 21 06:30:42 2015 UTC,"My takeaway from this is that while you can do all the things of the church, it doesn't garantee that you'll have a testimony. As a future parent, I hope to help my kids find and feel the joy in a growing testimony no matter when it is in their lives that they are more in tune and prepared to receive it.   Thanks for sharing!"

latterdaysaints,3dypx7,Iamstuckathope,26,Mon Jul 20 16:51:05 2015 UTC,"Be honest with yourself and those around you. You are living your life for yourself and not people in your ward and not even your siblings and parents. Do not make yourself miserable to accommodate others. If you will be lying about your faith, in my personal experience, you will be miserable, it will constantly gnaw at you. There will be no satisfaction in life."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,shaltinelis,7,Mon Jul 20 17:08:44 2015 UTC,"Even if you are right, being open still has consequences to me, my wife, and kids.   The relationships we have with our families and friends will be in danger.  I'm certain of that.  EDIT:  We've tested this with a few ""pilot"" programs.  It goes well with certain types of people and it goes poorly with certain types.   Our families are the types that it will go poorly with."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,ripmeistermeister,3,Mon Jul 20 17:17:29 2015 UTC,Rip off the band-aid.  Force your family to live their religion and show some charity.  Be honest with yourself and with them and you will all learn from it. This is coming from a pretty orthodox tbm btw.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,sandyguy,3,Tue Jul 21 02:29:50 2015 UTC,"Be honest with yourself and those around you.    I agree with that. Beyond that, I'd say the answer depends partly on what you still believe. If you still believe, for example, that Jesus is the Son of God (or at least probably is), you have a lot more options than if you've become convinced God doesn't exist."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,Gnolaum,23,Mon Jul 20 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend either of those options.  Perhaps:  C: Keep attending and serving, bear what testimony you can and have genuine discussions about matters that are difficult and important to you.  It might be uncomfortable for some; but important issues need to be addressed for the good of all."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,SpaceYeti,6,Mon Jul 20 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"This is really the best answer. Be honest with yourself and others. Don't bear testimony on something you don't have a testimony of, and likewise do bear testimony on this you do have a testimony of. When being offered callings, just be up front with the bishop on where your faith stands, as well as your willingness or not to serve in said calling given your position.  You can still go to church if you want and not have a testimony of ever principle. Ultimately, decide what it is YOU want to do, but be honest with yourself and those around you regarding your current faith."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,benbernards,6,Mon Jul 20 21:28:24 2015 UTC,"C: Keep attending and serving, bear what testimony you can and have genuine discussions about matters that are difficult and important to you.   This is really brutal.   I know some people make it work, but we've tried this.   It is intensely complicated.    The only way I could make that option work would be to refuse any callings or assignments."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,Senno_Ecto_Gammat,9,Mon Jul 20 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"If reusing a call on will keep you healthy and active, then do it! Be honest with those around you, and be charitable to them when they aren't charitable to you."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy,3,Mon Jul 20 19:39:18 2015 UTC,The only way I could make that option work would be to refuse any callings or assignments.   Can I ask why?
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,aoeu00,6,Mon Jul 20 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"I guess ""any"" was overbroad.   My wife and I have both been in presidencies for several years and now we are both teachers.  We feel like we would have to turn down any leadership callings and teaching callings, because it's getting way too tricky for us.   Some callings might be OK though."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,zeezromnomnom,3,Mon Jul 20 17:46:49 2015 UTC,My dad doesn't have much of a testimony but he's a great clerk.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy,2,Mon Jul 20 21:20:54 2015 UTC,dad doesn't have much of a testimony   Does he have to pay a full tithe to have that calling?  Edit: are there people without testimonies but still pay a full tithe?  I wonder if this question needs a thread of its own.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,kimodra,5,Mon Jul 20 22:43:33 2015 UTC,"There are, but not many. You don't have to be a member of the church to pay tithing, as it's a basic commandment like the Word of Wisdom or the Law of Chastity. I met people on my mission that attended church and simply didn't get baptized for familial (or legal/financial divorce-payment) reasons, but they kept as many commandments as they could; tithing was one of them."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,Gnolaum,2,Mon Jul 20 23:54:13 2015 UTC,He has paid a full tithe his entire life.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,Gnolaum,2,Mon Jul 20 22:47:47 2015 UTC,No testimony but pays full tithe? Yes me. It's a difficult situation but I'm still in a transition period and my husband isn't ready to stop paying tithing so I support him in that.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy,5,Tue Jul 21 01:56:41 2015 UTC,"I would be genuine.  If your Bishop felt it necessary to release you ... so be it.  I'm fairly confident saying that there are presently others in your unit that have the same concerns you do, and that there are others that are completely unaware of any issues and demonize those with any doubts.  This divide must be healed."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,GospelOfMe,4,Mon Jul 20 18:11:57 2015 UTC,My bishop actually did release me from my previous calling and put me in the one I'm in now.    Much of my inner conflict deals with my family.   There are a lot of times when this becomes an issue.  My family regularly brings up issues and wants to have discussion about theology and beliefs.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,Gnolaum,3,Mon Jul 20 19:35:04 2015 UTC,My bishop actually did release me from my previous calling and put me in the one I'm in now.   Then absolutely be genuine.  He put you in the calling knowing your concerns.   My family regularly brings up issues and wants to have discussion about theology and beliefs.   My family is similar; and it hasn't led to irreconcilable differences yet.  Obviously the dynamics for you are undoubtably different.  My ultra-tbm mother opined last discussion that it was possible that Joseph Smith was taken from the earth to prevent him from leading the church astray.  Through my brother is officially coming out of 'ex' shortly so we'll see how that goes.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,TheGilmore,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:56 2015 UTC,"My family regularly brings up issues and wants to have discussion   ""I'm sorry, but I'm just not comfortable talking about that today. How 'bout them Jazz? That last season was great."" (Or instead of changing the subject, there's always just leaving the room.) I have to do this every time politics comes up."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,jgardner,2,Mon Jul 20 21:22:32 2015 UTC,I have a personal rule now where I don't discuss politics or religion with my family. It's not very satisfying. I have to leave the room or change the subject when they bring up either heterosexual marriage or Bill O'Reilly. I like not having to lie about anything though.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,TheGilmore,5,Mon Jul 20 21:17:08 2015 UTC,My rule is if they bring it up I'm allowed to comment.  If they don't like my comments it's up to them to learn to not bring it up around me :P.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,jgardner,7,Mon Jul 20 21:21:47 2015 UTC,"Be true to yourself. Regardless of whether you believe there is a God, if He's real, He's had some strong words regarding people who pretend to follow Him."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,classycactus,16,Mon Jul 20 17:03:43 2015 UTC,"God's beef is not with people going through the motions while they don't have a witness. He says nothing but wonderful things for people who live righteously without knowing it is right. (See, for instance, Ammon's praise for the King Lamoni's wife!)  God's beef is with hypocrites who pretend to follow God's commandments but don't have an ounce of love for God or their fellowman. They pervert everything about his plan and lay a huge roadblock for the eternal salvation of others.  I have no problem serving with people who have doubts. I have seen them perform too many miracles to doubt that God is not with them as well as those who have no doubts. I know that Christ is putting his trust in them to lead and to serve in his church despite their doubts.  But I have a huge beef with people who don't care about the people they are serving. They are a stumbling block to the church.  Remember, we came to this earth to learn to live by faith. That means we had to have our knowledge and witnesses taken away so we could no longer tell one way or the other for sure. We were to learn how to keep God's commandments in the middle of doubt. Remember God's commandments are summarized as loving God and loving other as yourself. If we can simply do that in our darkest doubts, we're passing the test we came here to take."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,LSPismyshit,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:40 2015 UTC,"You're right, but I think (though I could be wrong) that this is a matter of pretending to have a witness. That's different than serving without having one. I wouldn't recommend pretending to have a witness that isn't there. You can serve regardless."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,workaccount314,4,Mon Jul 20 17:51:22 2015 UTC,I wouldn't recommend pretending to have a witness that isn't there.   Absolutely.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,Liberal_Mormon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:34:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think I agree with this.  Being active in the church, serving in callings, and acting as if you believe is just as much of a testimony of it as saying ""I know this church is true.""     And where do I draw the line?  Do I help clean the temple?  Do I attend ward temple night?  Do I bless or pass the sacrament when I'm asked?  Do I participate in blessings for my HT families or for babies?    This isn't just about what I say.  It's also about what I do."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,workaccount314,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:55 2015 UTC,Awesome.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,LSPismyshit,4,Tue Jul 21 00:05:27 2015 UTC,"Well if you don't have a testimony at this point in time, I don't think it would be a good idea to bear it falsely. I guess what you do next is up to what you want ultimately. If you want to rekindle your testimony, you know what you need to do. If you don't think it's possible to do that, then I guess plan A makes the most sense. I have a question though. If you don't believe, why stay? Is it just so much a part of your life you can't imagine yourselves without it? Are you still committed to staying if that testimony doesn't come back? I'm not judging you on that front, I'm just curious about your rationale."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:01:56 2015 UTC,"Leaving a church isn't easy at all. The pressure from church-oriented family members OP talks about? Yeah, that's a really big thing.  I started to realize about two years into college that the only reason I believed was because I was taught to as a kid. I started looking into religion furiously, trying to find some truth--the possibility of hell and the unforgivable sin (blasphemy, if I fully embraced being an atheist) scared the crap out of me. I became overwhelmingly depressed as I lived with my family and had to act like a totally different person. Here I am now a few months after finishing my masters degree and living on my own (I got a job and was able to move out about a month after finishing my bachelors degree) and I still play the part of being religious. It's kind of funny--with as much as my family is convinced that their religion is the one true religion just because they were born into it, they're perfectly fine with me studying the Mormon faith (then again, as far as they're concerned, my research is purely scholarly).  I guess what I'm saying is that yeah, it may seem weird that OP doesn't want to leave the church, but it's hard. The church becomes a community that you're used to interacting with every week, there's pressure from your family, an emotional toll, and fear if you're wrong. It may seem cut and dry (don't believe any more? leave) but it's really not. It's hard, it hurts, it's full of emotional lows, and it's something I hope no one has to deal with, but I know that's not realistic."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,LSPismyshit,4,Tue Jul 21 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"I think the Church has been good for me and my family.  My wife and I loved the Church as kids.  My wife and I come from families that take this very seriously.  It will cause our parents tremendous pain if we drift away, and I think it will be difficult and awkward if we are authentic with them.  In my community, being a believer is beneficially socially and professionally.  Finally, momentum."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,everything_is_free,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:12:48 2015 UTC,"The pain with your families will only be pain at first - they will come to accept your decision and love you for who you are. You're still the same people, and you're still their kids. You have to recognize that and be willing to stick it out until it gets better. I urge you to not run away from what you're afraid of in this case. I know it's easier, but don't do it. Be honest and be as active as you are willing to be. People are more understanding than you'd think after a month. I've had to do this in my YSA branch and I can tell you that being pulled in two different directions is the worst thing for you. Don't take that path. I promise it gets better.  No matter who anyone is in your community - if they see that you've lost your testimony and you are honest about it, they will respect you for that. People respect that sincerity more than anything else. Stick it out. Decide when you're going to tell your families your beliefs and when you're going to tell your friends. Stick to those dates. Talk to them and stay in touch. Make sure that they know you still love them.  I'm not sure if you'll go through with this, but I really hope you take it from someone who has done it before. This really is the best option. If you want to talk more, just PM me."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,everything_is_free,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:47 2015 UTC,"I totally feel where you're coming from. See my reply to /u/LSPismyshit for more of a background. It's tough to come to terms with where you are and it's hard to pretend you're still where you were--it seems like a lose-lose situation. My family is extremely fundamentalist Christian--I'm scared to death that if I tell them I don't believe in their faith anymore that they won't let me have anything to do with them or my nephews anymore. That, and my mother has depression pretty bad so I'm worried how she would react if I told her--she would literally believe that I would be going to hell. It's a tough situation and I don't really see myself being open and honest until my parents die. I justify it by saying that I'm thinking of my family first but I have a friend who says it's wrong because it's still lying, no matter what the reason is. Honestly, it's a hard situation no matter how you look at it. I'm sorry that you're going through this right now--I hope you find the best way through it so you and your wife can be happy."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,classycactus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:07:58 2015 UTC,"Well just make sure you staying is actually for you, and not just to please others. It might cause them pain in the short term, but if you really don't believe, if they love and care about you I'm sure they would rather you live your life authentically. I'm not trying to convince you one way or another, but evaluate why your doing this to make sure its what you guys want. I just left the church to be honest, and I know it was the right decision for me, but I came to that conclusion after years of contemplating. Good luck with whatever you decide to do, and if you ever need an ear feel free to PM me."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,everything_is_free,4,Mon Jul 20 20:49:51 2015 UTC,if they love and care about you I'm sure they would rather you live your life authentically   I don't think this is always true. Some people genuinely believe it's better for their loved once to fake it without a testimony compared to leaving the church. Nearly my entire extended family is like this.
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,classycactus,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I suppose your right. Its a hard thing. I'll be honest and say I still havent told my immediate family. I know they know that this is where I was headed, it's just gonna be a sucky conversation."

Most of it is not even about Mormonism, but politics, magnets, economics, etc. I don't know what your situation is actually like, so I don't know if what I do will work for you.

In this case IMO the best way to play the ""middle ground"" option is to say something like ""we've been battling some testimony problems lately and it's really hard for us to talk about it right now. We love the church and we plan to continue to be active but it's just really tough to talk about right now. [Subject change.]"" You may have to repeat this scenario a few times before people stop bringing it up. Most families wouldn't bring it up in the first place though, so this is a tougher situation than most ""middle-grounders"" face.   ""NOM"" is a term/group that encompasses a lot of situations but yours would definitely be in that zone and I bet you could go on those forums and get more ideas as to how to make this work for your family.  Of course it's also relevant that many people face identical situations if their families are very political and they have different political leanings. Looking at what those people do may be really helpful. For example if you pretend for a minute that your MIL had confronted your wife after a discussion on abortion rights and your MIL has feelings on it that are opposite to your wife's feelings. How do people who actually have that situation handle it?"

If you make the choice that the best option for your family is to keep the peace, then the ""stay quiet and keep attending"" path is a NOM path and there can be many reasons to do that which don't involve wanting to deceive.  My dad stays active despite having essentially no testimony because he feels that the youth programs are the best way to raise his kids, and he doesn't want the family drama of leaving, and he believes his church service is a positive contribution in his local community. He doesn't bear his testimony and he has asked to not be offered any teaching positions but he's NOM and content with his choices."

His preferred response (which I found annoying as a teen and appreciate more now) is to roll his eyes and say ""you can't believe everything you learn [from a seminary/sunday school teacher / in sacrament meeting / at EFY / etc.]"" We would usually argue with him by pointing out that the teaching was from the manual, and he would say the manuals aren't always right. We'd insist the church vets the manuals and he would say that doesn't make everything they say correct. At that point we would give up. By my late teens I realized he didn't have a testimony but I knew it would be a sore spot with my mom so I didn't bring it up until I had a good opportunity without her around, which was years later. I'm not sure what he would have said if we flat-out asked him if he was trying to contradict the prophet, but probably ""they aren't necessarily saying what you think they are saying"" or ""you are trying to make that apply in every context when they just meant it to apply to some specific contexts"" or something."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,zizrzazrzuz,2,Mon Jul 20 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"Why is that?   If we were completely authentic with our family it would be just as bad as if we stopped going to Church.   To them, a lack of belief is far more dangerous than a lack of attendance.   My family regularly criticizes doubters and intellectuals.  They regularly talk about people who left as being ""deceived.""    So I would have to play the part with them anyway, so why not play the part at Church too?"
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy,2,Mon Jul 20 22:49:14 2015 UTC,"I'm comparing the idea of deception with Plan A as described in your OP. You seem to be describing a NOM path that doesn't seem to require deception as far as I can tell. Is your Plan A deceptive from your perspective? Is going to church and acting (but not speaking) as a TBM, being deceptive? It certainly isn't ""playing the part"" completely if you are refraining from teaching things you don't believe.   I'm recommending acting the same way at church and with family, i.e. Plan A in both contexts.  To answer your question though, there are many possible reasons to be vague at church even if you aren't being vague with your extended family. To phrase that differently, there are many possible reasons to do Plan A at church even if you are doing Plan B with family. Here are just a few: it's an opportunity to practice being just slightly more vague than usual in some ways, to see what might end up working best in case you need to use one of those techniques with family at some point, it's an opportunity to be more true to yourself and honest with others at church even if the difference is only slight and even you don't get to do so when with extended family, and it's an opportunity to explore ideas from a new paradigm for three hours a week."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy,4,Mon Jul 20 23:22:20 2015 UTC,"This is a tough spot to be in.   It seems like your Bishop is a good fellow. Maybe talk to him about your current emotions. Perhaps even request having non teaching callings for a while. My husband requested to be released from teaching teens because of his doubts. He told the bishop that he didn't feel right teaching things that he wasn't sure about, and didn't think it would be appropriate to talk to them about his doubts.  As far as your family goes, that is a tough situation. I don't advise living a lie though, don't pretend everything is 100% okay. If you don't feel comfortable talking to them about it, don't initiate conversations, and keep answers brief if they initiate discussion.    If you want to still go to church and work on your testimony, by all means, do that. I think it is fine if you focus on your own personal study and testimony/relationship with god,  and take a step out if the lime light. Honestly, the  lime light sucks anyway, all the judgement, none of the support.  Hopefully this rambling makes sense, I am on my phone and that makes commenting harder."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,davect01,4,Mon Jul 20 18:40:38 2015 UTC,Honesty hurts at first. It is better you be honest up front rather than later they finally find out you were faking it. I would not want you in Sunday School/Primary teaching and and faking being sincere to me or my kids. Don't feel obligated out of false loyalty. The church will go on without you.  Later on if you regain testimony and true faith. You can always comeback. Because you can fake in front of people but you can't fake it to the Lord in the afterlife.

Don't bear testimony, but don't share concerns.  or  B: Talk and act like we did two or three years ago. Bear powerful testimony, home teach, attend the temple, agree with every word spoken in Conference.   I do not recommend ""B"". It pushed me so deep into depression to live inauthentic like that. You start feeling like every time someone seems to accept your lie is them calling you out for lying. You know you are lying explicitly or implicitly. You can hide yourself from them, but you can't hide from yourselves or God.  Same with ""A"" eventually.  Be honest with yourselves. It puts you in a better place to follow the spirit back in or all the way out - depending on what God says is right for you.  But faking it is a surefire way to depression.

latterdaysaints,3dypx7,yeshavesum,4,Mon Jul 20 17:50:07 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but that doesn't mean it would be difficult for us.  We would go from the golden couple to the dangerous couple.

latterdaysaints,3dypx7,LSPismyshit,2,Tue Jul 21 01:53:58 2015 UTC,"This is hard to say (and from personal experience it's hard to hear and harder to actually do) but here goes...  It's extremely rare to be branded ""serious threat"" IF: you keep attending, privately decline leadership and teaching callings (ensuring that NO ONE on the ward council knows your extended family members so no one talks to them about your private choices- if they do know your family you'll need to take additional steps), stay quiet but smile calmly and comfortably when the church comes up in conversation with extended family, never bring it up yourself even casually, when an adult family member brings up your struggles in private advise them that testimony struggles are painful and you would never want to put someone else through that pain so you would never talk about your doubts with anyone in the family particularly the youth, and if a youth tries to talk to you about it direct them to discuss any concerns they have with their parents.   You might be a ""minor threat"" in this situation, e.g. boys about to leave on missions might be kept away from you, but even that isn't typical if you lay very low. Many people can even be ""semi-active"" if they lay low enough in all other areas, without getting labeled a threat or causing serious ruptures in relationships. Minor ruptures have of course already happened. If you don't share in your family's main interest/goal/hobby there will be a bit of a rift. But it doesn't have to be much worse than this.   You are in an extremely painful position and I really feel bad for you and your wife. Things do get better, whether you choose to settle into the middle ground or you are able to ""pick a side"" as it were. This level of pain is temporary. There are later flare-ups no matter what you pick but it doesn't always hurt like this.  This is a little tangential but if you don't mind me asking, if you lost your testimony of the church would you still believe in Jesus? This came up in the Bushman AMA a few days ago and I think it's a relevant question as far as what you can still share with your family and whether ""acting Christ-like"" is the best way to phrase your goals in your family situation."

For years I often attended weekday or Sunday-evening services of protestant and catholic churches near me, and I found it very helpful in staying grounded and keeping some sort of connection to the divine from which I could draw strength, even while my testimony of the church was struggling and the 3-hr block was painful for me. I particularly appreciated the opportunity to ""get lost in the music"" with churches that had contemporary music."

I would recommend laying things out for your bishop just as you've done here, and answering honestly (but kindly) to anyone who asks you directly about matters of doubt and faith.  Other than that, I think it's fine to be low-key about the things you're struggling with.  In other words, there's a difference between keeping your business to yourself and actively attempting to deceive others about your beliefs.  I would stay away from the latter at any cost.  Don't attend the Temple.  Do home teach (no spiritual thought required, just go be a friend).  Do bear testimony of things that you do know, whatever those are."

latterdaysaints,3dypx7,rips10,3,Mon Jul 20 23:19:26 2015 UTC,"There is a lot to review here.  It is not  clear if your lack of Faith is directed toward the Lord,  toward Christ,  toward religions, or toward the church.   Are you still able to pray sincerely?    Have you tried meditation?    Tried writing in a thankfulness (Gratitude) journal a couple of times a week?   How about doing (non-church-based) service? Helping others is  great way to direct your thoughts & actions away from the Spirit of Contention.   Can you focus on what love you have for others and minimize thoughts & actions that might be directed toward your doubts  & disagreements?   Even if you feel pulled away from the church, please try to channel it into something positive & filled with love for others.  You may (or may not) find yourself pulled back towards the church & your extended family.    If not, you still may find yourself pulled closers to God.   Something like this has seemed to work for me.  ymmv, God Bless"
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,davect01,6,Tue Jul 21 00:03:24 2015 UTC,"Faith is not the absence of doubt. Faith is living the right way despite doubt. Or, in other words, faith is a hope for things which are true, and the evidence you cannot see. When all you have is a hope that these things are true, that is the beginning of faith.  That said, you need a real friend you can confide in and work through these issues with. If your family is not supportive, the sin is on their shoulders, but I wouldn't press the issue if it will just cause division. Talk to your bishop about it, he will know the people in the word who can be a real friend in hard times."

But from your history in here, it sounds like you really want to know the truth; and if you're unwilling to surrender your social position to pursue the truth as you understand it, it isn't totally surprising that you would have a hard time receiving more. Revelation requires real intent.  I'm a convert, and I wonder if this is why some ""born-and-raised"" Mormons have a tough time getting a testimony. Joseph Smith taught that sacrifice and saving faith are intimately connected -- but when showing up to church is the ""easy"" path (socially, professionally, etc.), it just doesn't generate the spiritual power that it otherwise would.  God would clearly prefer an honest search for truth outside the Church to a people-pleasing performance within it. Ultimately, you've got to decide whose approval you want most."

latterdaysaints,3dypx7,FuzzyKittenIsFuzzy,3,Mon Jul 20 17:37:35 2015 UTC,"As others have said, this is a very difficult decision - it certainly was for my wife and I as well.  I'm incredibly lucky in that my side of the family is hugely supportive of doing whatever you feel best draws you closer to the divine - if that means being active TBM, great!  If that means ditching church to go to the local park to feed the homeless a potluck, awesome!  If that means seeking personal revelation from Christ himself, more power to you!   In short, on my side of the family we are all very open with each other about where we land spiritually, and we don't always agree... but that's ok.    But... on my wife's side of the family, things are very different.  There is definite friction when we go to visit the in-laws, and they largely tiptoe around any subject that could be construed as religious.  My wife has been very open with her father, and he has said that he would prefer not to discuss the Gospel with us any longer because he is afraid that he will be forced to choose between his daughter whom he loves and the church which he loves.  For him, it's an impossible choice.  He clearly mourns the fact we are no longer active LDS, and does not want to try to understand how we can possibly feel like our lives are now  more centered in the Gospel of Christ than ever.    I think the difference, though, is that he still expresses his love for us and our kids, and wants to be involved in our lives as much as is possible for him.  While he does not understand the choices we are making, and does not want to expose himself to the difficult questions we have been forced to ask and find answers for, he does still love us for who we are - as unconditionally as any parent possibly could, I think.   And for that, I'm hugely grateful.  And I'm really sad that it does not sound at all like you are as fortunate with your family.  Several of my siblings have very difficult extended family on their in-laws side, and have faced similar situations that you are facing.  So, here's my advice, based on what they have been through:  TL;DR; - Be yourself.  Act genuinely the way you feel God (however you perceive God) wants you to act.  You WILL be happier in the long run.  Faking faith will never draw you closer to God, and will never satisfy your soul."
latterdaysaints,3dypx7,seis_cuerdas,2,Mon Jul 20 23:03:41 2015 UTC,"I wish this was the top answer. Your TL:DR is, in my opinion, perfect.   In regards to the differences between you and your wife's families. We all have short comings. Your family has a great ability to see beyond a cause and love the person.   Good for her family (dad) for trying hard to be there for you guys even though you probably fundamentally disagree about religion.   I myself am a parent of two. Yes I'll raise my kids to what I be the best way I know how, which will be geared in the LDS religion. I do, however, often wonder what they will be like when they are older. Will they have an early death? Will one turn out gay? Will one be a dead beat? Will they succeed in life? Be ambitious? Be kind? Be honest? I've thought of as many good and bad things they might possibly do and am trying to learn while they are young to accept them for who they are and will be as I watch them grow.

But I can't help but think that before the days of social media where one's unadulterated views on every little thing could be seen by anyone alive, there were many more agnostics who were Catholic when their Catholic parent were in town, or Baptists and Lutherans and Mormons of the same nature.  Once, before Facebook, and back when people kicked it at ~65, we just sort of owed it to our parents to let them die happy in the delusion we were just like them. The price for raising us I suppose.   But yeah, I've always suspected my mother's love was conditional. And now I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is. And I'd do anything to get that doubt back. Because frankly I prefer happy and wrong to sad but correct."

From Mosiah 27, regarding Alma the Younger's conversion:   23 And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:  24 For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.  25 And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;  26 And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.  27 I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.  28 Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.  29 My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.   This described how I felt very well.  And nothing you've done is on the level of what sins Alma had committed.    As for going forward.   If you are still struggling with some habits, don't feel discouraged if you can't shake them all at once.  It takes time for everybody.  Add good habits initially.   Start reading from the Book of Mormon.  Write in a journal(this was advice from a Bishop.  I thought it was silly, but it helped as much as anything else).  Pray.  A lot.   Attend church(which it looks like you're already planning on doing).  I would definitely meet with the bishop.  He will be more than eager to help you."

latterdaysaints,3dylmw,Hawkjester,12,Mon Jul 20 16:21:05 2015 UTC,"I really hope swearing does not make you unworthy to be a member, because if it does, I am in big trouble.  Your desire to improve this is a good thing (and something I should work on too). In fact, that desire and effort is the most important thing, more important than the results. I don't think they will ask you in your baptism preparation if you use foul language. But improving your attitude can only be a good thing. The problem with language is that it is a habit. And you can't just  turn that habit off and expect that you will never slip into a cuss word again, especially if you play Mario Kart.  I recommend doing things that change you environment (probably not possible with your work) or serve as reminders to get you to break out of the habit you want to overcome. A swear jar might be helpful. You can also ask the missionaries to give you a CTR ring (short for ""choose the right"") which can act like a constant reminder.  The most important thing is to be patient with yourself."
latterdaysaints,3dylmw,everything_is_free,5,Mon Jul 20 16:32:31 2015 UTC,I should have been a little more clear I guess I don't like who I am at work and the swearing thing was about all I could think off at the time lol. I just am a grumpy and angry person while at work and just don't want to be that guy anymore. Thank you for your comment
latterdaysaints,3dylmw,everything_is_free,4,Mon Jul 20 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"I totally get that. I literally spend my work day arguing with people... and sometimes I am not even on reddit [joke]. I am paid to be an adversary, so it can be hard not be angry and grumpy. There are a lot of ways to mitigate it. I take time out of my day, every day, to go on a jog or lift weights. I also try to bring some humor into the contentious situations. Meditation also helps. So does scripture reading and prayer.  If it is stressing you out too much and you find that you can't get around that, it may be worth looking into a change of profession, as hard and scary as that is. Your mental health is more important.   But just not being ""that guy"" anymore is going to take a ton of work and probably even more time, years perhaps. This is where the gospel helps.  President Packer said: ""The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior."" I think this is true, but ""quicker"" is not necessarily quick. Again, the most important thing is to be patient with yourself."

latterdaysaints,3dylmw,seis_cuerdas,3,Mon Jul 20 17:06:34 2015 UTC,"I am not a convert, but I have had similar issues in the past. During the time that I was in high school, and for year or two after that, I did a lot of things that that I shouldn't have (smoking, drinking, etc.). Eventually I decided that I did not want to live my life that way and so I gave all of that up and prepared for a mission. At first it was difficult because the conversations that my friends and coworkers would have were not very  appropriate in subject matter and it was hard not to join in. Little by little I worked on watching what I said and did when around my friends and eventually I found it easier to be around them without joining in with inappropriate discussions.  I don't think I was ever perfect about watching what I say before my mission, and I know I haven't been perfect since; but I know that I am trying and that is all that matters. You do not need to be perfect in order to be baptized, you are simply making the covenant to strive towards that goal the best that you can. If you feel the need to remove yourself from situations that make it difficult for you to be who you want to be, that's fine; but I don't think it is necessary because in my experience everyone I know was respectful of the changes that I made in my life, even to the point where I have had to explain to them that it is okay for them to swear around me and I that I don't care what they talk about when I am around.  tl;dr - Don't worry about it, just do your best and you'll be fine."

latterdaysaints,3dylmw,itoomustgive,2,Mon Jul 20 17:06:14 2015 UTC,"This is a good time to bring up J. Golden Kimball, a church leader in the early 1900s.   He was well known for swearing good naturedly from the pulpit, sprinkling ""damns"" and ""hells"" into his speeches. Although the habit was of concern to other church leaders, and subjected him to counsel from his brother, and brother in law, LDS President Heber J. Grant on many occasions, this common touch made Kimball one of the most beloved leaders in the history of the Church. Asked how he could get away with the way he spoke, Elder Kimball is said to have replied: Hell, they can't excommunicate me. I repent too damned fast.   Nobody is perfect, not even the church leaders!  Everybody has a few ""favorite sins"" that they need to work on.  Those might be swearing, gossiping, lying, judging people unfairly, etc.  That's part of life, figuring out how to be a better person.  Your baptism is one step along that journey."
latterdaysaints,3dylmw,jgardner,2,Mon Jul 20 18:00:35 2015 UTC,As a convert and former military I am well versed in cussing in the past. You will be alright. You would not be the first LDS to have a habit of swearing. In time through the laying on of the Holy Ghost and further training in scripture studies. You will find it eventually receded and fade away.  I find myself not cussing at all now. Father is not naive to dealing with bad habits and is quite forgiving as that as why we have the sacrament to forgive our sins after repenting.

latterdaysaints,3dzen2,cry_fat_kid_cry,8,Mon Jul 20 19:44:58 2015 UTC,"This is one of the instances where the ""poetic"" language of the King James Version seems to do more harm than good.  The literal greek is ""ho kai hymas antitypon nyn sozei baptisma ou sarkos apothesis rhypou alla syneideseos agathes eperotema eis Theon di anastaseos lesou Christou"".  A direct translation would be ""which also us typical of now saving baptism not of flesh a putting away of filth but of a conscience good demand toward God through resurrection of Jesus Christ"".  If the original greek were referring to a number or digit it would have used arithmos or psifio, however we find instead antitypon which simply means ""symbolizes, representing a type or pattern"".  As a side-note, the word only appears twice in the New Testament: 1 Peter 3:21 and Hebrews 9:24, the latter describing the temple as only a pattern of the holy place where God's presence resides.  Interesting that the same word connects both baptism and the temple."
latterdaysaints,3dzen2,mahelious,5,Mon Jul 20 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"""Figure"" can be used to refer to numbers, in our current 21st century vernacular, but I don't think it was used that way in the 1600s. ""Figure"" can also refer to a shape or a likeness. ""This like figure"" probably means something more along the lines of ""In the same way."""
latterdaysaints,3dzen2,Arkholt,6,Mon Jul 20 21:11:03 2015 UTC,"The word that KJV translates as figure comes from the Greek word ἀντίτυπον  which is normally translated as ""corresponding to"" or  ""copy, representation.""  It is also important to note that the word is neuter and singular and therefore cannot be referring to the number eight since in this case ὀκτὼ (eight) is feminine plural since it is an adjective modifying the feminine plural noun ψυχαί (souls).  Thus, rather than referring to an actual number it is instead referring to the whole situation of Noah and his family in the flood."
latterdaysaints,3dzen2,nubbles,4,Tue Jul 21 03:26:12 2015 UTC,"First of all, it would be nice to have a reference. 1 Peter 3:20-21  I think that ""the like figure"" is that baptism saves us (by water) just like the 8 people on the ark were saved (by water).  Here are the same verses in a couple of other translations:  NASB   20 who once were disobedient, when the patience of God kept waiting in the days of Noah, during the construction of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through the water. 21 Corresponding to that, baptism now saves you—not the removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience—through the resurrection of Jesus Christ   NIV   20 to those who were disobedient long ago when God waited patiently in the days of Noah while the ark was being built. In it only a few people, eight in all, were saved through water, 21 and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also—not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a clear conscience toward God. It saves you by the resurrection of Jesus Christ   ESV   20 because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water. 21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ   NRSV   20 who in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were saved through water. 21 And baptism, which this prefigured, now saves you—not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ"

Mountain Meadows, likewise, happened during the Utah War, when the US government sent an army out to wipe out the ""rebellious Mormons"" with military force.

I'm no expert, but my sincere conclusion is that the Church is OK with questions so long as you operate on the premise that God exists and loves you no matter what, Jesus Christ died for us and rose again, and Joseph Smith and Thomas S. Monson were  chosen by God.    As long as you are just trying to reconcile the evidence with those three unchanging conclusions, you are fine.     By contrast, the Church opposes a path where you stop believing and stop obeying commandments while you examine the evidence."
latterdaysaints,3dum2f,Iamstuckathope,8,Mon Jul 20 17:04:14 2015 UTC,"It depends on what the question is in the first place.  For most questions, I just pray. I mean, there is very little that prayer doesn't eventually answer, if we pay attention.  If I wanted to know why Joseph Smith had multiple wives, I would first contemplate what such a question has to do with my personal salvation. If I determine that somehow it has something to do with my salvation, I will turn to the scriptures, and pray about it.   When I have done those two things ... I will give no more worry to the subject, unless it is something that I feel will keep me out of heaven. Then I will pray until I get an answer.  Personally, I don't actually put too much into day to day church ""commandments"" unless they are in the scriptures. I can support the brethren without putting them before Christ. So, if in the last conference say Elder Hales says something and then six conferences from now, someone else says something that is completely the opposite ... I will still support them, but I would have always referred to the scriptures on instituting any of it into my daily life anyway. Obedience is not ignorance ... we have agency, we have intellect, God's chosen can give counsel, but ultimately, sticking to the scriptures and the word of the Lord will never lead a member to perdition."

I want to better understand how to talk about this subject with those who approach questions differently (as you can see from the variety of answers, approaches vary greatly), but it's good to know I'm on the same page with at least some people out there!"
latterdaysaints,3dum2f,onewatt,5,Mon Jul 20 16:13:35 2015 UTC,"Warning: super long, meandering thoughts.  I think that ""doubt"" and ""faith"" as used by interneters like ourselves are terms that indicate conclusions about data instead of our approach to data. This isn't necessarily bad, but we need to be honest with ourselves about how we deal with the information that inundates us.  Too often, for the ""doubter,"" all data can be used to show that the church is ""false.""  Data which does not fit the doubter model is rejected.  For the ""faithful,"" all data can be used to show the church is ""true"" and contrary data is similarly rejected.  If you've ever spent time over at the exmormon sub you can see their frequent confusion at how ""those guys"" (believers) can't see ""the truth"" staring them in the face.  The real truth, of course, is that all information is sent through our individual prisms of faith, doubt, or disinterest.   Being honest with ourselves, therefore, is one of the most valuable traits for gospel learning. For only the honest person can say ""I recognize that I have a faithful bias, and I'm okay with that,"" and thereby also recognize and utilize the facts which others may dismiss out of hand as being false.  Recognizing our biases actually frees us to learn MORE than those who simply say ""that other group is totally wrong.""  Let me give you an example from reddit.  I once posted about how the Book of Mormon contains something called ""If... And..."" statements which are normal in Hebrew:   ""If... And...""  In English, it is common to express a conditional idea in the following manner: ""if you come, then I will come,"" with then being optional. In Hebrew this same idea is expressed in another manner: ""if you come, and I will come."" This structure makes perfect sense in Hebrew but is not found in English. When Joseph Smith translated 1 Nephi 17:50, he dictated ""if he should command me that I should say unto this water be thou earth, and it shall be earth."" This non-English construction was removed from this verse by Oliver Cowdery as he copied the original manuscript to produce the printer's manuscript. He deleted the word and, making the text read better in English. The sentence now reads: ""if he should ..., it should be earth.""  Thirteen other occurrences of this Hebraic conditional were printed in the first edition of the Book of Mormon and then later removed by Joseph Smith in his grammatical editing in preparation for the second edition of the Book of Mormon, published in 1837 in Kirtland, Ohio. One of these instances is the famous passage in Moroni 10:4, which originally read: ""if ye shall ask with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in Christ and he will manifest the truth of it unto you by the power of the Holy Ghost""   This is a great piece of evidence that points towards both the Book of Mormon as possibly having an authentic Hebrew language source, while also demonstrating that Oliver and Joseph didn't just ""throw in"" some hebraisms for the appearance of authenticity since they themselves then removed them as mistakes.   However, after posting this, an exmormon asked me a question along the lines of ""How do you account for the *linguistic anachronism X* also found in the Book of Mormon?""  as if saying, ""I dismiss your evidence because I have evidence for a different conclusion than yours.""  His bias prevented him from considering additional information that could have given him a more complete picture of the subject.  To put this in a secular setting, a good scientist doesn't say ""we should dismiss string theory because it doesn't resolve the problem of observer-dependence in quantum theory."" Instead a good scientist says ""String theory has strengths and weaknesses and we need to know them both to be able to effectively arrive at greater truths.""   In other words, we may prefer the view from one eye, but we don't need to close the other.   As we ask questions we have to be aware of our biases, and be okay with those biases. Just like a scientist might be a proponent and reasearcher of a certain theory and that's okay! Nobody is completely unbiased, but being aware of our preconceptions can help us learn and teach others more effectively. A great example of this is Royal Skousen, who, when he gives presentations about his work, talks about both the solutions and the problems his research raises. He also revisits previous theories and says ""here's where I was wrong,"" or ""here's something unexplained that needs to be developed.""   So, step one: take a page out of the science handbook and be okay with being a specialist. Just as we wouldn't dismiss the work of a physicist studying string theory just because he or she also thinks it's true we shouldn't dismiss the work of believing researchers in our field, nor should we dismiss our own faith-positive research and conclusions just because we're faithful. It's totally okay to study by learning and by faith.   Point two: In the paradigm of the Lord, secular evenhandedness only gets you so far. True knowledge in the paradigm of the Lord doesn't come only through evidence, research, and observation. It always comes through action and participation.  Jesus says, ""If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine."" Alma teaches that faith becomes knowledge through experimentation, not study. Oliver was taught that we gain knowledge through our mind and heart.   While we are never asked to abandon logic, we are asked to accept spiritual evidence to gain spiritual knowledge. We're allowed to say things like ""I know Jesus Christ lives"" because we have a spiritual knowledge that isn't based on linguistic artifacts, ngram studies, or archaeological finds.  Just like we're allowed to say ""I love you"" and know it's true, we're allowed to know about the things of the spirit and have that knowledge carry just as much weight as any secular knowledge.   Paul put it this way:    9 But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.  10 But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.  11 For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.  12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.  13 Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.  14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.  15 But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.   One of my favorite speeches tells us about how our education can ""confirm and inform"" our faith. (see here)   Of course, none of this frees us from the consequences of repeated exposure to doubts. Somebody who decides they're going to put all his or her studies on to the ""tough questions"" is going to have faith begin to wither. We can never afford to abandon the essentials.   Now I'll actually try to answer your questions.  Sorry I got off track.   What is your approach to asking questions?     I usually can't think of good questions of my own, but questions on reddit actually inspire my study quite a bit.  Am I weird?  Here's an example of how a simple reddit question led me to study and discover something I never knew about before.    Do you think your approach to knowledge helps sustain your faith or to negate it?    It can do both. This is why essentials like prayer and scripture study are so, well, essential.    How do you decide what questions are important and worth your time?    Interest...    Do you give preference to scriptural questions, historical questions, or other types of questions?    I prefer scriptural and philosophical questions. Questions like ""why would Jesus say __"" bring much more intimate encounters with the spirit, which is what I'm really after. I fully expect our understanding of history, language, and culture to change rapidly over time as we approach truth, but my relationship with God will always be important to me.    Are you comfortable letting things remain unresolved for the time being and study them over time or do you seek for quick certainty?    I, like most people, prefer quick and easy answers. However, I'm slowly learning to recognize that research takes time and there are such things as unanswered questions.    When asking questions, do you put obedience to church instructions (or commandments) on hold, pending the discovery of their truthfulness?     No.  I find that my testimony of church instruction comes through action. I'll be honest, I would actually be glad if the word of wisdom were eliminated as a commandment, or proven by society's measures to be a 100% great idea. But I recognize that my obedience to the commandments simply makes me happier, and that's also a valid truth."

I have a lifetime of data that doesn't fit the doubter model, and I don't reject it.   I am more critical than I used to be, but I don't reject data that supports faith.

To take an extreme example (not saying this is like the BoM) If a 1865 journal entry talked about an iPad, I would be highly critical of it.  I wouldn't reject compelling textual evidence, but it would take a tremendous amount to overcome the iPad reference.  In fact, someone would have to explain why ""iPad"" appeared in the journal entry before I would even consider the document as authentic.   That doesn't mean I would reject the other textual evidence, it just means I would wait to consider it until I got over the ""iPad"" hurdle."

Then you fit the model of the person I described as being able to acknowledge their own biases for greater information. This isn't surprising given your history of being very open about your doubts and seeking more information.   I don't see this as a rejection of your data.   I meant to indicate that, in the context of his message, he was rejecting my data. I didn't want to post the whole message since it was a private message. So this is the gist of it.    Whether you reject it or not is irrelevant to what he did, which was to try and convince me I was wrong for accepting data which suggested a contrary conclusion than his own based on his preferred data."

That makes sense.  But I still think it's reasonable, in some situations, for a person to conclude that a certain problem will outweigh all opposing evidence.    For example, if a guy claims he never slept with an alleged rape victim, I will disregard pretty much all character evidence if his DNA is found where it should not be found.   I don't think that rejecting his testimony is ""bias.""    Maybe I'm confused here."
latterdaysaints,3dum2f,onewatt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:53 2015 UTC,"I still think it's reasonable, in some situations, for a person to conclude that a certain problem will outweigh all opposing evidence.   Of course this is true. That's why the second point I make is about accepting evidences. For the believer, a witness from God that the church is true is naturally going to carry much more weight than the presence of Egyptian names in the Book of Mormon, or the use of anachronisms in Isaiah verses. However, those secondary pieces of information can be valuable tools in the search for greater knowledge.   A great example of this is the work done by Royal Skousen in finding instances of Early Modern English in the Book of Mormon which don't exist in the Bible. He found a few linguistic oddities and rather than simply dismiss them, be started doing research. That led to a bunch of new information that most people just don't know about, and new avenues of research we never would have thought of if he had just said ""it's weird, but unimportant, since I already know the church is true.""   The research being done by linguists now is going in totally unexpected directions and may very well transform our views of not only the Book of Mormon, but of revelation.   Another example: for some exmormons, the idea of Joseph using a hat during the translation is just hilarious and needs no further analysis. For them, the church is afraid of this fact and the use of the hat proves there was no real translation, therefore there is no real Book of Mormon. But the reality of the hat can also be used to strengthen our information if we're willing to accept it as a data point instead of a conclusion. The witness statements about the translation process were a valuable tool for Dr. Skousen in evaluating the original manuscripts and developing a detailed picture of the translation. That data then further informs us, if we're willing to accept it. However, if, at any point we say, ""my conclusions mean I need no more data,"" then we stop learning the truth. That's why, even when we have our strong evidences and make our conclusions, it's still appropriate to continue the search for greater knowledge."
latterdaysaints,3dum2f,holdingvadersleash,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"I think ""ask and Ye shall recive"" is a true principal. Our church was started by young Joseph Smith  asking a question. Keep asking, it can open the windows of heaven and bring answers and understanding."
latterdaysaints,3dum2f,itoomustgive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think the intent of the question matters a great deal. I worked in tech for a while, and there were two types of questions: questions that were genuine questions about a piece of work that required clarification or wasn't well understood, and questions that were designed to inflame passions, be passive aggressive, and make a cruel point.  It was always pretty clear which was which and what motive the questioner had going in.  For me, it's helpful to apply that same filter to questions within the church. I've never seen anybody at church shamed for asking earnest questions in an effort to understand. If you really want to know the answer, and have the spirit with you, then it's pretty clear.  When people ask questions to be antagonistic, I believe that's also pretty clear, and I have no problems with leadership shutting down those types of people at church. That type of questioning disrupts the spirit and isn't conducive to other's learning."
latterdaysaints,3dum2f,Stratiform,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:29 2015 UTC,"First, all questions are important and worth your time. All of them. There is no unimportant question, as long as it is important to you.  Second, don't take an answer and come up with the evidence for that answer. If you do that you're not answering a question. Doing that will never resolve your questions and you will merely have the same question again later. Instead you should come up with analysis through prayer, reading, research, whatever you like - and use that to construct your answer. Your answer will never be the same as another's. I know most post-mormons give me crap for still believing in a God, but that's simply what I believe is the most logical explanation to my question of ""Why?""  Yes, leaving things unresolved is important. With my science background I strongly believe that you can't ever have absolute knowledge, and the pursuit of knowledge should simply be trying to find the best way to be ""less wrong."" You can't expect to figure things out without some amount of time to contemplate your findings. This may not be church-approved advice here, but I liked what Robert Kirby said on Friday in his article pertaining to obedience:   ""Agreeing with someone just because they're in charge is the best way I know of to prolong whatever it is that they may have gotten wrong. And let's be clear about that — no group of human beings, regardless of how special they believe themselves to be, ever gets everything right.""   Kirby is a faithful member.  Best of luck and I wish you well in answering your questions, whether they be ""Should I take this new job?"" or ""Why did Joseph marry so many women and try to keep it a secret?"" All of your questions are important, some are just... less important than others. It's up to you to determine which ones those are."
latterdaysaints,3dum2f,JustBrightEnough,3,Sun Jul 19 21:53:13 2015 UTC,"I reject the council that has been encouraged in the Ensign, General Conference, and so on that teaches us to rephrase our questions into ""faith promoting"" ways.  A question is a question and truth gets us there no matter how we phrased it.  If we have cannot get answers from leaders to hard topics without first getting a lecture about phrasing, then perhaps the answers aren't satisfying no matter the spin.  If my question is ""Why doesn't Joseph's translation of the Egyptian in the Facsimiles match actual translations?"" just answer. Don't lecture me that I should have asked it as ""How does my faith in the restoration grow in light of worldly scholarship failing to understand the divinely sanctioned mission of the Prophet Joseph Smith, Jun.?""

latterdaysaints,3dum2f,yeshavesum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:06:14 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on what one means by ""questioning"". If it means using the best of your faculties, striving to understand the will of God and know what course is right, then it's basically the same thing as ""pondering"", and it's an affirmative commandment.  Often, though, ""questioning"" is a euphemism for trying to hammer God into your own image, which is obviously inappropriate. I don't think any line of questioning is inherently off-limits -- any topic can be investigated faithfully and sincerely (or not).   How do you decide what questions are important and worth your time?   Basically I look into anything I find interesting or troubling. The only thing that I would consider ""not worth my time"" is endlessly re-litigating the Church's truth claims every time the Brethren say something I find challenging.   Are you comfortable letting things remain unresolved for the time being and study them over time or do you seek for quick certainty?    Obviously we have to be somewhat patient with the Lord's timing for some questions, but hearing so many ex-members talk about their ""shelf"", I think we need to be more proactive about shining a light on stuff that bothers us.  The adversary thrives in darkness and confusion, and we can't afford to live in fear that our deepest-held beliefs might be disproved by whatever's under the next rock. If the gospel is true, we need to know it, so that we can dedicate ourselves fully to it. If it's false, we need to know it, so that we can keep searching for something that is true.   When asking questions, do you put obedience to church instructions (or commandments) on hold, pending the discovery of their truthfulness?   Absolutely not -- part of the reason God calls prophets is to teach us things that would not otherwise be obvious to us, and we receive a witness of the truthfulness of the commandments by living them (John 7:17)."

How this works for me, I personally like the book journal instead of a google doc journal my mind works better writing thoughts out instead of typing them.   When I read scriptures or religious docs I do so with my journal beside me, date already written in, because I pray and expect revelation as I read (it doesn't always come but I'm prepared for it when it does). The more I practice this the better I've become at learning the language of the spirit. Me being in-tune varies from month to month, but as I keep up the practice it's amazing how the Holy Ghost will literally guide you to better understanding. I find that sometimes I come up with a question, true, but more often I find and answer first then write down what the question would be.   TL:DR the more you invite, expect and commune with the Spirit, the better you will understand the language of the Holy Ghost who helps us learn and remember all things."

A man who previously held the priesthood but was not endowed should generally be ordained to his former priesthood office. Again, his membership record will show his original ordination date, with no reference to excommunication.  A person who was endowed in the temple before being excommunicated may regain priesthood and/or temple blessings only through the ordinance of restoration of blessings. This is a special ordinance performed by a General Authority as directed by the First Presidency. Afterwards, a new membership record is created, showing the original dates of baptism, endowment, sealing, and (if applicable) priesthood ordinations—with no reference to excommunication.

Whatever blessings they could have, it is clear they cannot gian the fullest blessings of the Atonement without those ordinances, thus work for the dead.  The ordinances are essential to salvation. The Lord blesses those who have not gained those ordinances and made covenants with Him as much as possible, but there are still blessings held beyond them until they make covenants with God through the ordinances of the priesthood."
latterdaysaints,3dtwvg,pierzstyx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:03:03 2015 UTC,"there are still blessings held beyond them until they make covenants with God through the ordinances of the priesthood.   Do you really think that the Lord looks at a faithful LDS person who really wants to get married, but hasn't had the chance and says ""Well, I am going to withold blessings from her because she hasn't entered into a covenant?"" That would be sad and surprising if that were true."
latterdaysaints,3dtwvg,birthdayboy31,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:16:48 2015 UTC,"You assume those blessings are just there ot be handed out willy nilly. They are not. D&C 130:20-21 reads:   There is a law, irrevocably decreed in heaven before the foundations of this world, upon which all blessings are predicated—  And when we obtain any blessing from God, it is by obedience to that law upon which it is predicated.   Quite simply you cannot claim to all he blessings of the gospel just by being good and faithful because being good and faithful means having being through every rite and ordinance required to receive those blessings.  Those not sealed in the temple, for example, cannot receive the specific blessings of a temple sealing without being sealed, no matter how good of a marriage they have.  That said, God does not without every blessing in eternity because of the work for the dead, which will ensure that in the long run every person will have access to those blessings because they will  have made those covenants."
latterdaysaints,3dtwvg,pierzstyx,0,Tue Jul 21 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"No, God isn't spitefully or willfully withholding blessings -- but if you aren't married, and you consider marriage a desirable thing, you clearly are missing out on blessings (the most obvious of which are intimacy, the ability to have children, etc.)  We have been promised that all these blessings will be ours eventually, but wanting to be married/baptized/whatever is obviously different from actually having those blessings."
latterdaysaints,3dtwvg,yeshavesum,4,Mon Jul 20 12:13:46 2015 UTC,I'm curious as the which blessings you think you are missing out on. Sincere question.
latterdaysaints,3dtwvg,greenthumb79,2,Sun Jul 19 19:39:02 2015 UTC,Who down votes a sincere question?
latterdaysaints,3dtwvg,greenthumb79,2,Sun Jul 19 21:43:33 2015 UTC,Don't take it personally. You can usually count on at least one downvote bot at any given time in /r/latterdaysaints.
latterdaysaints,3dtwvg,onewatt,2,Sun Jul 19 22:14:17 2015 UTC,"In my past, I've had experiecnes where both the stake president and bishop went against the rules of the church as moved by the spirit. It does happen. But I would also say that if it does not happen, are you willing to wait the year? If you are not, then why would you be ready for rebaptism in less than a year?  Is there anything wrong with enduring all penalties placed upon you by the church as they seek to protect you, others, and the church? Is there any better way to show how confident you are in your decision to be re-baptized than to wait a full year?   You seem like a resonable person, so I expect that your answers to my questions will be along the liens of 'yes, that is OK. But it would be nice if not.' Yes, I agree with you. It would be nice not to have to endure such penalties. I hope that all works out well for you and trust that Heavenly Father will continue to watch over you as he has in the past.   Good luck on your journey! Please don't hesitate to contact your bishop and meet with him regularly. Ask him for things that you can study as you seek to learn more about the importance of the baptismal covenant and the sacrament. Be active in your missionary efforts to help others learn of the gospel. God bless!"

The idea is to help you build the discipline required to be worthy of those blessings by making the gospel a regular part of your life. Think of it as spiritual boot camp to train your mind and body."

Hope that my loved ones will also see the truth and come around one day. It takes a big person to admit that they were wrong, release their pride, and come back to Christ. Thank you for being that person."
