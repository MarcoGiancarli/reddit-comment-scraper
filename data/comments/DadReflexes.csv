By telling me about dogs and shitty owners you're telling me I'm correct in my original statement, that dogs do love to break shit - even the ones that are well trained did, in fact, break shit before they were trained right? Otherwise you wouldn't HAVE to train them in order for them to not do so.

This man in this gif needed to lay out to grab the ball, but in the bartman video, he didn't need to go full extension because the ball was landing on the grass. The spectator leaned over the guard to catch the ball.  Now whether that should count as an out or not is up for debate."

DadReflexes,3b2k3f,OTC7,3,Thu Jun 25 21:20:00 2015 UTC,To be a homerun it can't be through the side lines? (Sorry for my lack of knowledge)

DadReflexes,3b2k3f,kwyjiboe,2,Thu Jun 25 22:10:26 2015 UTC,Correct.  Any ball that lands beyond those lines is foul.   A home run is when it goes over the wall in flight ( i.e. without bouncing) in fair territory (between the lines)

DadReflexes,3b2k3f,true_gunman,-5,Thu Jun 25 21:19:48 2015 UTC,Baseball players shouldn't be able to jump over to catch it. They should also be fined if they do.

DadReflexes,3awbg4,greengrasser11,25,Wed Jun 24 15:33:40 2015 UTC,"Steve Bartman incident:       The Steve Bartman incident occurred during a Major League Baseball (MLB) postseason game played between the Chicago Cubs and the Florida Marlins on October 14, 2003, at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois.  In the eighth inning of Game 6 of the National League Championship Series (NLCS), with Chicago ahead 3–0 and holding a 3 games to 2 lead in the best of seven series, several spectators attempted to catch a foul ball off the bat of Florida second baseman Luis Castillo. One of the fans – Steve Bartman – reached for the ball, deflecting it and disrupting a potential catch by Cubs outfielder Moisés Alou. If Alou had caught the ball, it would have been the second out in the inning, and the Cubs would have been just four outs away from winning their first National League pennant since 1945. Instead, the Cubs ended up surrendering eight runs in the inning and shortly afterward lost the game, 8-3. When they were eliminated in the seventh game the next day, the ""Steve Bartman incident"" was seen as the ""first domino"" in the turning point of the series.   In the aftermath of the incident Bartman, a lifelong Cubs fan, had to be escorted from the stadium by security guards and placed under police protection for a time, when his name and address were made public on Major League Baseball message boards.

If you are so upset about fan interference then tell MLB to move the seats further back from the wall, because where that guy was sitting he was able to hold a fucking baby with a bottle and catch the ball with ease."
DadReflexes,3awbg4,austex_mike,20,Wed Jun 24 05:28:06 2015 UTC,tell MLB to move the seats further back from the wall   But then they wouldn't be able to cram as many seats in as they can.

DadReflexes,3awbg4,TheOneObelisk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:01:23 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if its illegal but it's definitely against the rules so you'd probably get tossed out if you get caught

DadReflexes,3awbg4,longshot,42,Mon Jul 13 19:52:26 2015 UTC,I caught that too. The announcer's priority is the sanctity of the game while the fan's priority is having a good time. I tend to side with the fan. It's just a game.
DadReflexes,3awbg4,Popular-Uprising-,16,Wed Jun 24 17:34:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah if the guy went out of his way to interfere I'd understand being upset.  But that wall is designed in a way that someone could scratch their balls with one hand,  and reach out into the field and catch a fly ball with the other.  That's just way too easy to expect people to be able to judge if the ball is still playable. Not to mention they now can use replay like they did in this case.  No harm no foul ball."

DadReflexes,3awbg4,Rekt_Ryan,-6,Wed Jun 24 11:38:25 2015 UTC,Or maybe it wasn't such a good idea for a man feeding a baby to try and catch a fly ball that could interfere with a professional sporting event. Just a thought.

DadReflexes,3awbg4,Ed_Tivrusky_IV,15,Thu Jun 25 01:11:39 2015 UTC,Well if the fielder wasn't there to catch it (which he didn't know because he was watching the ball) the ball probably would have bounced off the tarp towards his kid in an unpredictable manner.  I think he made the right call.
DadReflexes,3awbg4,theraf8100,25,Wed Jun 24 12:02:10 2015 UTC,"Woah now, you can't presume that he might have made the right call. I'm sure the Dad is evil and wanted a foul ball more than he cared about the safety of his kid. Or at least that's what everyone down below was telling me."
DadReflexes,3awbg4,nilleftw,-4,Wed Jun 24 12:31:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, instead of having fans not interfering, you should rebuild the stadiums. Much easier!"
DadReflexes,3awbg4,kennerly,7,Wed Jun 24 14:24:36 2015 UTC,You could pretty easily add a barrier or just remove the front row of seats.  But this would cost money either in lost seats or the cost of constructing a non-sight blocking barrier like a net or something.  So it's never going to happen.
DadReflexes,3awbg4,austex_mike,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:15:52 2015 UTC,No one said anything about rebuilding a stadium.  In this case you could simply remove one row of seats.  Seriously it was effortless for that guy to reach over and grab that ball.

I agree with you that he should have been kicked out, that's why the rule is in place. I was just saying the commentators seemed to be taking it way too seriously. Guy obviously made the wrong decision, but it didn't end up having an impact on the game."

DadReflexes,3awbg4,mister_moustachio,9,Wed Jun 24 04:42:39 2015 UTC,Could someone please explain what happened to someone who hasn't got a clue how baseball works?
DadReflexes,3awbg4,RapedByPlushies,56,Wed Jun 24 16:19:19 2015 UTC,"When a ball is hit by the batter, the opposing team has a chance to catch the ball before its first bounce and get the batter out which is very bad for the hitting team.  However, if the ball flies too far left or right, and lands in the stands where a spectator can catch it, then the play is called a foul and it only counts as a strike against the batter, which is not as bad as an out.  Because the spectator leaned in and caught the ball, this counts as a strike because the spectator's body counts as outside of the field even though he leaned in, but the opposing player could have caught the ball and made an out if the spectator hadn't got in the way. The commentators are complaining because it's poor form for the spectator to lean in and snatch balls from the player's reach."
DadReflexes,3awbg4,mister_moustachio,29,Wed Jun 24 05:10:30 2015 UTC,"That entire thing read just like a 'simple english' wikipedia article, exactly on my level! Thanks!"
DadReflexes,3awbg4,Popular-Uprising-,13,Wed Jun 24 07:25:51 2015 UTC,"Not in this case. The umpires (refs) reviewed the play and ruled it an out anyway since the player was obviously going to catch it if the fan wasn't there. No harm, no foul."
DadReflexes,3awbg4,RapedByPlushies,3,Wed Jun 24 08:03:21 2015 UTC,My mistake. Have an upvote.
DadReflexes,3awbg4,SleepWouldBeNice,9,Wed Jun 24 08:12:31 2015 UTC,"One addition: foul balls cannot count as a strike three. So if the batter has two strikes, and hits a foul, the batter is not called out."
DadReflexes,3awbg4,greengrasser11,2,Wed Jun 24 17:36:29 2015 UTC,What's happens in that case?
DadReflexes,3awbg4,SleepWouldBeNice,7,Wed Jun 24 19:14:51 2015 UTC,Just another pitch. Count will stand at 2 strikes.
DadReflexes,3awbg4,mind-sailor,3,Wed Jun 24 11:26:09 2015 UTC,Oh so can you explain in which case it would be a home run? I thought that when the ball lands in the stands it's a home run.
DadReflexes,3awbg4,RapedByPlushies,8,Wed Jun 24 15:38:26 2015 UTC,"In general, the batter is supposed to hit the ball forward from where he's standing, over the heads of the opposing team. At the far end of the field there is a fence that is considered the edge of the field. If it's hit over that fence at the far end, then it's a home run.  This is different from hitting a foul because a foul ball is hit over the left edge or over the right edge of the field, not the far end of the field.   Sometimes there are stands behind the far end where spectators can catch home runs, but in general, the places where people can catch the ball is in the foul zone.  A better description might be a little confusing because it involves geometry. The baseball field is the shape of a quarter circle. A quarter circle has three sides: two straight sides and a curved arc. The batter stands at the junction of the two straight sides (which have been the center point if it had been a full circle) and hits the ball toward the arc. If the ball passes over the edge of the arc, it's a home run. If it passes over one of the two straight sides, then it's a foul. Typically, people sit in the stands that line the straight sides of the field because that's where most of the action is, although there are usually some seats around arc.  EDIT: Here's a picture."

DadReflexes,3awbg4,slimindie,4,Wed Jun 24 14:37:10 2015 UTC,"Take a look at this diagram. (It's not perfect, I don't know what the question mark areas are supposed to be, but it'll do.)  The green and brown area is the playing field. If a ball is hit and its first bounce lands anywhere in that area, it's fair and the batter can run.  If it lands in the blue area, it's a home run because it was hit out of the playing area without going foul.  Anything hit into any other area is a foul ball, whether it goes back behind the batter, into the stands off to the side of the playing area, or hits the ground in the dirt outside the foul line in the infield. Fielders can still catch foul balls to make an out if they are able, but foul balls count as strikes if the ball is not caught (up to two total strikes, after which foul balls don't count as anything and the batter just continues with two strikes)."

DadReflexes,3awbg4,pfafulous,7,Wed Jun 24 16:51:11 2015 UTC,"The dad interfered with the play of the game.  Each team takes turns trying to score points. When a team has three players get ""out"", then the other team gets a chance to score points. An ""out"" can be made many ways. One way is if a ball is hit in the air and the defender catches it before it hits the ground.   In this case, the defending player was about to catch the ball, but the dad in the stands reached out into the field of play and prevented that from happening. It should be noted that the dad was a fan of the team trying to score points, and as such would be happy to prevent an ""out"".   There are rules in place for just such a thing. Even though the dad interfered and prevented the player from catching the ball, the rules allowed for the officiants to still declare the player who hit the ball as ""out"", even though the defending player did not catch the ball.  Related, balls are hit into the stands all the time, and fans like to catch them. This is fine. The problem here is that the fan reached into the field of play.  (The post is called pulling a Bartman because of a similar situation in a very important game a decade ago. The offending fan is named Steve Bartman. He caught a LOT of flak for it. Poor guy still gets his name dragged through the mud. Do a search of his name if you'd like to learn more.)"
DadReflexes,3awbg4,mister_moustachio,3,Wed Jun 24 10:01:25 2015 UTC,Thank you for that very clear explanation?   Isn't knocking balls into the crowd somewhat dangerous?
DadReflexes,3awbg4,pfafulous,3,Wed Jun 24 22:34:31 2015 UTC,"The balls are usually ok. It's the broken bats that get dangerous. A woman was recently seriously injured, although she seems to be recovering. They have nets in the most dangerous areas. Still, gotta pay attention during the plays."
DadReflexes,3awbg4,Cubbance,2,Wed Jun 24 08:08:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for clarifying the Bartman reference, because, like a lot of people, I thought it was something to do with an episode of the Simpsons.  And, having read up on it, it seems to me like Steve Bartman is a genuinely good guy.  He felt bad about the incident, and has continuously refused to profit from the situation, declining all interviews and offers since it happened.  He even turned down a six-figure deal to appear in a Super Bowl commercial."

DadReflexes,3awbg4,fate3,3,Thu Jun 25 04:49:06 2015 UTC,the home team was batting and the guy was out so this hurt the home team

There's one team in MLB that has a winning percentage greater than 60% and that's pretty much the norm.  You can't get too bummed out over a loss in baseball or you'll become clinically depressed.

DadReflexes,37smx1,Fresh_C,2,Sat May 30 08:57:31 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you. I get his counter point about sleep deprivation and mistakes, but..  I don't believe a 45lb TV on a thin dresser 5 inches from a baby that can already stand is AT ALL POSSIBLY reasonably justified due to lack of sleep or otherwise.  If you are getting that little of sleep, you need to talk to family or friends who can help, or child services of some sort about your inability to raise kids safely with your stress levels.  This isn't a suggestion, it's your duty legally and ethically as a parent.  Being over worked, tired, stressed, and at the brink of crazy is part of parenting. Questionable decisions and some bad judgement calls are a part of parenting. Kids getting hurt a bit is a part of parenting.  UNDERSTANDING when you are at the end of your rope and getting help before it's too late is a part of simply being a responsible adult.  A kid nearly being crushed to death by a 45lbs TV you left on an unstable dresser in an unattended roomwithin grabbing reach of an already standing infant is not a part of parenthood."
DadReflexes,37smx1,Child-in-Time,8,Sat May 30 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't think this is a horrible impossible mistake to make.  Yes as a parent it's your duty to look out for this kind of thing. But I'm sure they had reasons for thinking it was safe. Perhaps they thought the TV was too heavy to move on the dresser and that the baby didn't have the strength to move it that much.  Obviously they were wrong, and I'm sure they learned their lesson. They're not going to win any parent of the year awards for this mistake, but I don't think they deserve to be publicly shamed over it either."

I have Chrome Metropolis messenger bag and I had a cup of coffee while sneaking up our back porch stairs (12 total) when all of a sudden my over the shoulder buckle just unclipped out of nowhere. In a single motion I put the cup down on the stair in front of me and shot my arms backwards to save the vase like I was giving it a piggy back ride.

DadReflexes,35yegu,SpRick3t,2,Mon Jun 22 14:39:03 2015 UTC,camera system with motion detection. you setup a schedule for it to record on motion.. would be weird to plug/unplug the cameras just when you are home then forget and thats the time you needed it for someone breaking in. :o)  I have alot of parties at my place and when parents bringing their kids around makes it easy to keep an eye on them outside around the yard or inside the house when you are in another part of the house.

DadReflexes,35eoa8,Rumci,32,Sat May 9 18:04:39 2015 UTC,Rule 1 states reflexes can be good or bad.
DadReflexes,35eoa8,kenabashi,84,Sat May 9 18:37:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, but I mean... kicking a ball is not a reflex. Hitting a kid in its head? Luck, or even skill maybe. But definitely not a reflex."
DadReflexes,35eoa8,Rumci,8,Sat May 9 18:39:01 2015 UTC,"I'd argue in this instance that on no other occasion did he have the co-ordination to pull of this kick no matter how much he tried he couldn't ever get it that on target.   In this one instance where he is attempting that same feat and being a father, his dad reflexes kicked in and it finally worked... just in time to nail his kid in the face with his wife nearby.  EDIT: Otherwise known as ""Dad Luck"".   For instance my dad once, many years ago, while we were home and mom was out thought it would be funny to teach our baby sister this gesture.   Why you ask? Well, because he thought it was funny and it looked like she had tried to do it while flailing around. After a while he finally managed to get her to do it, we all laughed and she was having a great time.   Naturally at the height of his fun mom pulled into the driveway and he did his best to get her to stop. Mom walked in and was greeted by my laughing, my other sister laughing and dads patented I'mtotallynothidinganythingfromyouHeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyHon face.   Only behind him our sister went right on happily making that rude gesture to the birds in the cage across from where she was sitting."
DadReflexes,35eoa8,RidiculousIncarnate,6,Wed May 13 22:57:18 2015 UTC,I would say the bad reflex is how he does his little running twirl before realizing what happened to the kid.

DadReflexes,33tt2a,levyl44,68,Sat Apr 25 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"As a cheerleader, maybe I can help shed some light. When you cheer for a while, you get so used to seeing stunts and pyramids that you can tell from the way they're going up whether or not they're likely to come down. This helps me a lot with catching stunts that are coming down, and I've only cheered 2 years at the college level (you can't do these pyramids on high school).   Now imagine if you've been doing it for 10+ years AND your job was specifically catching falling stunts and nothing else. You only pay attention to things coming down. That's what designated competition spotters are like and that's why they're super pro at knowing when and where things will fall before they do."
DadReflexes,33tt2a,IAMA_cheerleader,33,Sat Apr 25 23:32:11 2015 UTC,I find it amazing that he even puts his foot out to catch others that are falling. Amazing reflexes.

Looking at this again, my guess would be that one of the two front spots on the left was actually the designated front spot for the middle. But he got distracted catching the falling totem on the left. This is why you don't put multiple pyramids together unless each of them hits solidly on its own"
DadReflexes,33tt2a,larrybirdsboy,40,Sat Apr 25 23:22:12 2015 UTC,living up to the username.
DadReflexes,33tt2a,wdn,3,Sun Apr 26 04:06:56 2015 UTC,Watching this has me thinking that if three people are being thrown at once then there should be three spotters. Is that not how it's usually done?
DadReflexes,33tt2a,IAMA_cheerleader,7,Sun Apr 26 13:17:29 2015 UTC,There were. I wrote another comment about it. Basically one of the 2 throwers on the left was the designated spot for the middle because if a flyer shows stability then you can do that. But he got distracted when the left totem came down
DadReflexes,33tt2a,TheHYPO,4,Sun Apr 26 14:32:46 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: know nothing about cheerleading  But just from logic POV, wouldn't there be design symmetry in the routine? two guys throw the girl on the right and continue to hold her; two guys throw the girl on the left and would presumably be expected to continue to hold her.  Are you just saying that if the girl in the middle faltered, his emergency job would have been abandon the routine and leave the two guys to hold the girl on the left and catch the falling middle girl. Symmetry still seems logical to me. I would have thought that if one of the guys on the left had that job, so would one of the guys on the right, just in case the middle girl was falling towards the right instead of straight forward or to the left.  However, no one on the right reacts."
DadReflexes,33tt2a,IAMA_cheerleader,5,Wed May 13 21:25:36 2015 UTC,"Designated spotter is just something your coach writes down when they fill out forms about the routine for the judges.   Those forms allow the judges in a competition to know where to look at any given time both for scoring (different judges focus on different things in some competitions) and to ensure all rules are being followed.   The rules for some pyramids mandate several designated spots but say that some spots can leave to other parts of the stunt ""if the flyer displays stability"". This is partly BS in my opinion because it basically means ""if you hit the stunt youre fine. If it falls then you broke a rule in addition to losing points for the fall.""  The reason i assumed that the left guy was designated has to do with his hitch angle and because a lot of people will intentionally try to fall in the same direction every time to make catching more predictable and spotting easier.   Both sides could have been designated spotters, but my primary point was that they weren't actually expected to spot because it was expected to hit."
DadReflexes,33tt2a,TheHYPO,2,Wed May 13 22:46:33 2015 UTC,"So basically, the spotter assigned to spot in the event that something goes wrong and she falls didn't have to actually spot because ""pshhh, she's not going to fall. What can go wrong flinging someone 2 stories in the air""?"
DadReflexes,33tt2a,IAMA_cheerleader,3,Thu May 14 15:37:34 2015 UTC,"It sounds bad but in actuality a lot of the required spotters aren't necessary if you have good body control and decent experience with the stunt. Because like I said before, you can make sure you fall in a certain direction, and then you keep those spotters but others aren't necessary. There are stunts that are that high or nearly that high that don't require any spotters (one man lib and stuff) because it's understood that you can have near absolute control over how it comes down.  Of course, it looks like they didn't have that much experience with this stunt and so they shouldn't have been throwing up all 3 pyramids at once without mastering all 3 individually and then in groups of 2. I think i said that somewhere else."

DadReflexes,32qylp,FunkyFarmington,8,Sat Apr 18 05:30:43 2015 UTC,Im not a dad but one time at a family get together my baby niece was playing next to a coffee table. Her head lines right up with the edge of the table and she was sat a foot away with her back turned to it. I put my hand between her head and the table with my palm towards her head and sure enough she fell backwards right into my hand. I felt like a hero

DadReflexes,2yp0uj,StraightToVideo,145,Wed Mar 11 16:57:44 2015 UTC,I feel like the coach has seen her do this before. Because she makes the same mistake twice- (idk the technical terms.) her butt gets too close to the bar and causes her to fall.
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,watermelonhappiness,71,Wed Mar 11 19:19:18 2015 UTC,I imagine that after a while it's actually pretty easy to see when the performers don't have enough momentum to make it completely over.
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,rdvl97,39,Thu Mar 12 06:19:38 2015 UTC,That's what confuses me about this.  She went for it twice and messed up both times.  If that's how she was doing them in practice I have no idea why her coaches would let her compete it.
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,Portal2theFloor,37,Thu Mar 12 19:42:31 2015 UTC,"She appears to be pretty young and she is doing a fairly complex move.

I was just wondering why her coaches let her compete it. I was a competitive gymnast for 12 years and my coaches didn't let any of the gymnasts they coached compete skills they didn't have totally down. They mainly did that so something like what happened to this girl didn't happen to any of us."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,Portal2theFloor,20,Thu Mar 12 20:34:24 2015 UTC,"I know nothing about gymnsatics, but maybe she needed extra points to make it into the top ranks so they tried a risky move with little to loose?  Also, the mental pressure in competition is really high. Maybe she was just blocked. I have the highest respect for people who perform in front of audiences."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,user5543,10,Sat Mar 14 09:54:04 2015 UTC,"I actually didn't think of that.  And I can understand mental pressure in competition, but if she's at the point where she can even try to perform that skill I don't think she should've had trouble competing."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,Portal2theFloor,16,Sun Mar 15 00:12:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know how best to put this, but I think there's something about participating in a competition level event that sometimes brings out the best in people; not too say that it always beings out the best in people.   Throughout my teens I used to fence (foil, for the savvy) at a reasonably high level - even got into the British World Championship a few times.. and did quite well once. Anyway, not to be pretentious (...ugh), but, along with many sports,  fencing was a delicate balance of speed, strength, and, most importantly of all, strategy.   Every match started the same for me, slowly approach and rest my sword on his, apply a bit of pressure, and just wait (insert whichever gay joke you want here. The next stage was just trying to learn their habbits and this could take anything from 20 seconds to 2 rounds.   Anyway,  the - 'shit,  I can't figure this guy out' - moments were occasionally enough to bring me to the top of my game; the kind of situation where you're distinctly aware that you need a fix, or you're fucked...that's my interpretation of it.   TLDR; waffle waffle waffle Waffle.   Waffle Waffle, self-indulgence, Waffle.   The point."

DadReflexes,2yp0uj,tefoak,4,Tue May 26 00:09:14 2015 UTC,"1.) I'm betting the girl probably wanted to do something ambitious, and the coach supported her in doing that, which I think is a good thing. It's not a bad idea for the coach to advise against it either, but I think giving the girl some autonomy and letting her learn her limits in a relatively controlled environment isn't a bad thing.   2.) Being able to do something in practice doesn't mean you'll be able to do it in front of a crowd in a competition, especially when you're young and relatively inexperienced. It's very possible she was suffering from some serious stage fright up there, and was capable of performing the move relatively consistently under the right conditions. He might have just positioned himself like that because she was demonstrating stage fright."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,LPFJII,3,Sun Apr 19 21:02:57 2015 UTC,Crowd. Executing perfectly in competition is so much harder than practice.
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,BobRainicorn,2,Tue May 12 19:18:13 2015 UTC,"I imagine that the coach knows the routine, which is why he's there just in case something goes wrong."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,EarthboundCory,3,Thu Apr 30 16:46:48 2015 UTC,"If you watch it even at the Olympic level, you'll see the coaches (spotters) move towards the bars just in case when there is a risky element coming, because that's what they are there to do. Spot the gymnast in the risky elements."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,TheHYPO,80,Wed May 13 21:42:54 2015 UTC,He reacts way before she is actually falling. Like he sees her mess something up slightly and knows a fall is coming on the next rotation. Its really weird.
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,Noondozer,30,Wed Mar 11 19:43:31 2015 UTC,I feel like she's probably made the same mistake tons of times during practice so he knows there's a chance she'll mess up and fall.  He inches up way before she makes a mistake.
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,thisislaffable,3,Wed Mar 11 20:29:39 2015 UTC,"That's what spotters do for pretty much throughout every routine. See for example, the first clip I googled of Olympic level uneven bars. Note the spotter who is always there just in case because it would be too late to stand aside and react only once the gymnast makes a mistake.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66t7xhA4YXg&feature=player_detailpage#t=77"
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,TheHYPO,77,Thu May 14 15:14:50 2015 UTC,"this isn't weird.  he's a gymnast training another gymnast.  to an outsider, it looks like magic.   but ask somebody inside the sport about stuff like this.  it's almost like he's spinning with her up there.  he knows everything that she is doing down to the microsecond.  what's more, he knows it before she does and has spotted her mistake before she even knows she's made one.    it's undeniably cool to see, but it's par for the course."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,KING_0F_REDDIT,12,Wed Mar 11 22:44:46 2015 UTC,"That's confusing given the fact that male gymnasts don't do the uneven bars. I agree, he's a coach and knows what to look for, but it's not like he's a male pole vaulter teaching a female pole vaulter, the actual gymnastics events are quite different."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,catocatocato,2,Thu Mar 12 04:16:58 2015 UTC,Can you point out where the mistake is? I don't see anything until the last second.
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,NoShftShck16,8,Thu Mar 12 03:04:20 2015 UTC,"i'm no gymnast, but at 24 seconds, as she attempts to flip her legs free of the bar (and then catch the bar with her hands) her legs catch the bar and send her downwards, where the coach is waiting.  i imagine this is a common problem for gymnasts learning whatever move this is."
DadReflexes,2yp0uj,KING_0F_REDDIT,3,Thu Mar 12 03:30:30 2015 UTC,"For the first rotation, start watching at :20 and watch her form. She doesn't position her legs correctly to be able to release and follow through to be able to grab hold of the bar again. That's why she tries and comes up short, having the coach catch her from paralyzingly herself. I'll edit in a second for the second attempt.   At :55 you see her moving back and forth on the bar. That could easily be from nerves because typically gripping the bar wouldn't take that much movement. Then about 1:02 or so she makes the same mistake and isn't in a good position to be able to pull through to release, rotate, and grab the bar again.   Source: Sister is a gymnastics coach and was a gymnast for a while and I was with her a lot."

DadReflexes,2yp0uj,huracan_6,3,Thu Mar 12 00:19:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're right.

The situation is clearly that the mother cheated on the ""dad"" with this other guy, but they knew they couldn't tell anyone in fear of breaking up their marriage. So the real dad follows them, taking random jobs so that he will be there at the times when the kid is there so he can save them if there is a problem.  Do you think this was actually a TSA agent who happened to be in the right place at the right time? No, he was there to watch over his child. He knew it was gonna happen, and he saved his child without his child actually ever going to know him.  Quite sad actually."

DadReflexes,2toinx,adunn13,22,Wed May 13 07:33:52 2015 UTC,"Like she said in her YouTube post, had she freaked the fuck out and ran up there what do you think her kid would have done? What kids usually do when their parents freak out, she would have let go and probably seriously hurt herself.   She wasn't nearly close enough to get up there in time and be in any position to do anything about it, so you cross your fucking fingers and hope she holds on.  From the time her daughter grabs to when she is at a point when she'd hurt herself by letting go is like 3 seconds, by 4 she is at the top.   So here is how those seconds go,   ""Oh good she's on finally.""   ""Why is she holding on?""   ""Hah, thats funny, she can't possibly... oh shit.""  Then the camera angles away and you hear her semi-freak out for a second.   And then as she starts to come around the other side she calms down a bit and laughs.  Hindsight is 20/20 but I highly doubt ANY parent would have reacted in an ""acceptable"" way given so little time in such an odd circumstance.   The BEST reaction you could hope for is that as she was like halfway or near there that you have the presence of mind to yell, ""Hon let go of the side!"" and hope she doesn't wait too long before doing so.   Nobody is perfect and if you honestly think she's an awful person for this then hopefully you never have to meet other parents because some of the irresponsible shit they do would make you honestly wonder how they aren't in jail.  tl;dr: Settle the fuck down. The kid is fine."

DadReflexes,2tdjfg,thebaconisforever,183,Wed Apr 1 02:13:06 2015 UTC,Probably would've helped if the baby was strapped in. I suppose the straps could've broken though. Still better than if he hadn't caught the stroller I'd say.
DadReflexes,2tdjfg,Exporian,44,Tue May 12 16:49:01 2015 UTC,"The buckles on these things are usually junk. My son was born in the top percentile for height and weight, and from the time he could sit up he loved to bust his way out of stroller and high chair straps just by straightening his body and pushing his hips up. Sometimes you'd find an item that had strong enough straps that he couldn't do it. But our cheap stroller, a few times he busted his way out and slipped out while we were walking."
DadReflexes,2tdjfg,quackdamnyou,28,Fri Jan 23 06:41:05 2015 UTC,I believe it's purposely designed like that. It's a breakaway feature so that with enough force it will detatch. This prevents accidental strangulation.

India has 22 major official languages and about 1000 minor ones (200 got extinct in the last half century). So to communicate with all these diverse 1.26 billion people, we need common languages. Hindi and English tend to serve as those, so people tend to know at least these along with their native tongues.   This multilingualism makes speaking in different languages at a single time second nature for us. Infact most people speak in a hybrid of two or more languages, like Hindi+English = Hinglish, Tamil+English =Tamlish etc. So, you can hear someone say ""Aaj mein school car se gaya.

DadReflexes,2oy40z,Santaball,6,Fri Dec 19 08:27:36 2014 UTC,"Damn dude, nice catch. My father had reflexes like these and I cannot wait to put these genetic reflexes to the test when I have kids of my own. I remember one time my mother made fried clam strips for dinner once. They were so chewy I didn't really understand how to break them down before swallowing, so naturally I just started choking on one. My father jumps up from his chair, rushes over, jams his fingers down my throat, pulls out the nasty, half-digested clam strip and throws it away. The table was silent as we were all in awe at what just occurred. Naturally, I started crying. I like to think of the crying after a dad-reflex just occurred as a way of saying ""holy shit my dad is so fucking cool and I can't even comprehend it."

Also, Dad reflexes are PROPER reactions to a child in danger, not necessarily the fastest.   This past weekend we were visiting my wife's Aunt and Uncle and their grandson, 18 months old, was there.  He grabbed a butter knife off the table, turned, stuck it in his mouth, and trundled off at his top speed.  Everyone freaked out and grandma (my wife's Aunt) started yelling at someone to stop him.    I got eye contact with the little guy and smiled, he smiled back and slowed his pace.  I just put my hand down to him and he put the butter knife in my hand, giggled and ran off in another direction.    I could have freaked out and jumped at him, which would have scared the poor kid, as I had never met him before, so I was a stranger, rather than good Cousin CanopyFlyer. So that type of reaction would have ended badly.  The funny thing, everyone ELSE did attempt to react in that way and I still got there first.   Dads rule.   EDIT: An errant possessive."

I don't blame the driver, it's just a sucky situation for everyone.  EDIT: I found a better quallity version in this video that was posted on this subreddit that shows a wider frame of the camera.  With the larger frame the car doesn't actually look like it's going that fast, and the driver simply lost control of his car."
DadReflexes,2mdnau,somanywtfs,22,Thu Dec 11 16:40:11 2014 UTC,"Not to be horribly cynical but looking at the wider angle and realizing the camera is also a car. The guy had to be going fairly fast and doesn't even break. The red lights you see on the back of the car are running lights. So it really to me seems like this guy, went around the slow moving car in front of him to go faster through traffic. After he realized he's made a horrible mistake and hit someone he pulls off to the right and stops fairly quickly. By the end of the video you can see the car that hit him is completely stopped. We have a lot of these road conditions in Washington state and a lot of people are pure assholes about how to drive in such conditions. Perhaps it's not the same case here but it's the only angle I can really see it from."
DadReflexes,2mdnau,Marshmalllowman,22,Thu Dec 11 17:39:41 2014 UTC,Then the piece of shit was driving too fast for conditions. Still needs their ass beat for it.
DadReflexes,2mdnau,somanywtfs,-30,Mon Dec 15 18:38:01 2014 UTC,He was driving normal speeds. If anyone needs an ass beating it's the asshole that is filming. He is stopped in the middle of the fucking road.
DadReflexes,2mdnau,Marshmalllowman,18,Mon Dec 15 19:01:49 2014 UTC,"Yeah, that hadn't crossed my mind until you said it. Hopefully it was a dash cam of someone else stopped in traffic.    At which speed exactly, is the normal driving speed for, ramming in to a man while he is holding a small child next to a completely stopped car?"
DadReflexes,2mdnau,TheSinningRobot,-15,Tue Dec 16 17:53:47 2014 UTC,"First off, that is a beyond loaded question. It is never a correct speed for ""ramming into a man while he is holding a small child"". However, it's pretty obvious that this was an accident and not on purpose or due to some asshole being impatient. If you watched the video I linked you will see that the car filming is stopped in the middle of the road just behind the car that was sideswiped.   So with that in mind, let's look at this scenario. A father stops his car so he can take care of his child, but doesn't pull over far enough to the shoulder to make the road clear. At this point a driver sees them and stops in the middle of the road (completely blocking traffic) and starts filming this father with his child. Keep in mind that it has rained recently / is raining, so the roads are wet and muddy. With this in mind, car 3 (the car that hit the dad) is driving at a normal speed on the HIGHWAY (when even then he was going slower than the speed limit on most two lane highways). He sees the stopped car, attempts to stop, but slides due to the muddy road (remember that part?). He avoids the stopped car, but can't get enough turn to totally miss the fathers car, thusly side swiping it. He then crashes into the woods.   Now you might say ""that is based off a bunch of total bullshit"". Unfortunately that isn't so, as if you look at this video logically you will see that all of this is present. The car was stopped, car 3 obviously tried to avoid both cars (which is obvious because he crashed into the woods) and side swiped the fathers car.   If this is anyone's fault I would blame the stopped car in the middle of the road. There is plenty of space to go around, yet he sees it fitting to stop and film this car.  However I don't like playing the pointing fingers game, so I will continue to say that this was an accident where all parties wished it could have turned out better."
DadReflexes,2mdnau,somanywtfs,3,Tue Dec 16 18:16:42 2014 UTC,"Alright so let's break this down. I didn't see the video you posted because it got removed, but I did see a gif that had the incident at a wider angle, I can only assume it's the same as the content in the video. First of all you are right, they definitely should have pulled over to the side of the road more, maybe he couldn't, maybe he was being stupid, we don't know. You are wrong about the car filming. In the initial gif, you can actually see that it starts to go to the left, assumingly waiting for an opportune moment to pass the stopped car, not just stopping in the middle of the road. Also, the vehicle didn't just come to a sudden stop, he was slowing down pretty reasonably, which means the car that drove on the side was doing one of two things. Either he wasn't paying enough attention/going to fast, to be able to stop behind the car, or he was being impatient and tried to go around not realizing the other car was there. Either way it was his careless driving that was at fault. But, the whole situation would have been avoided had the dad pulled over further."
DadReflexes,2mdnau,Marshmalllowman,9,Sun Apr 12 09:50:55 2015 UTC,"Basically, all I heard was, if he wasn't texting and speeding, he would have seen that it is a) raining and b) stopped vehicle in the roadway and would have been able to determine that the best speed for such a operation is TO FUCKING STOP DUMBASS. If the driver was either paying attention properly or driving the appropriate speed for the current conditions (see what I did there, the stopped car, and the rain, ARE the current conditions), this would not have happened. That fucker would have been dead in the driver seat when the cops showed up."

I was not ok. I wasn't maimed or seriously injured, I rode home just fine then felt sore for a few days. Just saying, you are in no pain at all w/ shock - shock kicks ass."

In that brief second that the bike toppled over my dad put his leg under the bike so that I wouldn't get the exhaust pipe on me. His shoe broke and his toe went through and he both broke it and it jumped out of the joint.  He fixed his toe, checked on me, asked if I was fine. I was, kinda. He wasn't, he had more and more serious injuries than me. He behaved like a champ. He fixed the bike as good as he could and we went home on it. It was like 10km home almost only dirt roads."

Sure, the car that hit the guy should not have hit the guy, nor is it acceptable that he hit the guy.

You can see the straight line of the road in the distance and this guy is obviously in the road.

DadReflexes,2lqey7,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Feb 12 04:03:50 2015 UTC,"Spiral fracture:       A spiral fracture (a.k.a. torsion fracture) is a bone fracture occurring when torque (a rotating force) is applied along the axis of a bone.  Spiral fractures often occur when the body is in motion while one extremity is planted. For example, a spiral fracture of the tibia, a bone in the lower leg, can occur in young children when they fall short on an extended leg while jumping. This occurrence is known as ""toddler's fracture."" Spiral fractures are also recognized as being suspicious in very young children since to obtain a fracture of this sort requires forceful twisting or jerking of the limbs.

Don't get me wrong, I'd never hurt a kid; I was molested, and I'd shove railroad spikes into my eyes before I put another kid through what I dealt with.  And then I found that people don't care as much as you might think they do. I smile, wave, stick my tongue out at kids... etc... Most people just laugh, 1 in 50 gets upset...  Just don't sweat it. If you act worried, you're a lot more suspicious. I should know"
DadReflexes,2lbggq,ZenBerzerker,10,Sat Nov 15 22:58:46 2014 UTC,"Dunno who downvoted you, your input here is very interesting, as well as your small glance into the mind of a pedophile.   People always assume that if you're a pedophile you must be a complete psycho, ready to abduct and rape a child if given the chance. I'll admit that I always assumed pedophiles must be really sick in the head. From what you've just said it's clear to me that you understand perfectly clearly that relations of that nature with a child are not acceptable, and it sounds like you've accepted that you can never act on your desires. Nor do you really want to once you've thought about it logically because you never want to hurt someone like that.  You sound like a person. A person with a temptation to do wrong, and a person who has that temptation under control. We all deal with temptations like that, it's just that most people's temptations are not as polarizing as yours.   Thanks for your voice here, I found it very interesting. Could I get a slightly more detailed telling of your slow realization that you're a pedophile and how you've dealt with it?  And to your final point, agreed. If I've learned one thing in life it's that if you act like you know what you're doing, people will assume you do and leave you alone. Act worried, nervous, or sketchy and people will pay attention right quick."

There were far more people around than in this example, some on the very same escalator, and it was just that generally people were more involved in their conversations or destinations and not necessarily aware of their surroundings, not that they were outright passive or malicious.  In the case that I witnessed, the kid wasn't in any distress, not making any noise or freaking out. They were just having a fun ride on the outside of an escalator until suddenly they were getting very high off the ground and it wasn't fun anymore."

DadReflexes,2lbggq,Spastic_colon,5,Wed Nov 5 18:02:11 2014 UTC,"Bystander effect:       The bystander effect, or bystander apathy, is a social psychological phenomenon that refers to cases in which individuals do not offer any means of help to a victim when other people are present. The probability of help is inversely related to the number of bystanders. In other words, the greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that any one of them will help. Several variables help to explain why the bystander effect occurs. These variables include: ambiguity, cohesiveness and diffusion of responsibility.

Let me give you a quick run down:     short enough for airflow on a hot day. covers knees for kneeling and scrambling (under cars, over boulders, on a roof, up a steep hiking trail). tough enough material to not worry about. low profile avoids snagging. usually a slightly stretchy material means full range of motion. standard pockets. cuff doesn't drag on ground while walking, prevents fraying, means our SOs aren't nagging us about ""those ratty old jeans"" that we've only owned for a month. comes in more colors than jeans, means we can look good while dressing practically."

So blue and black. Yeah, blue and black are versatile, but sometimes I wanna have fun.   Capris on the other hand are made by companies that are expecting people to wear them in more fashion conscious ways than jeans+graphic tee=dressed. They will put out all different colors. I've got a green pair personally, and I've seen them in just about every shade I can think of.   Why bother cuffing a new pair of pants when you can just buy capris? Why bother rolling up your pants every time you put them on? Why bother hunting for pants that are 30x31 because 30 is awkwardly short and 32 drags on the ground? Just buy capris and forget all that mess.   Yes, I am being a bit silly, but to prove my point. I honestly love capris and it bugs me that men aren't allowed to wear them. They're the perfect summer wear, but every time I wear them I get snide comments on them. Frustrating."
DadReflexes,2ktxj1,downhillcarver,14,Sat Nov 1 07:06:00 2014 UTC,"You know there are other types of pants then capris and jeans right? There are chinos, slacks, corduroy pants, sweatpants and even linen pants! Denim also comes in way more colors than just blue, I have seen purple, white, green, orange, and brown denim.   And although yes capris are somewhat functional, so are cargo shorts that go below the knee.    men aren't allowed to wear them.   It's not that men aren't allowed to wear them it's just that they look god awful and accentuate feminine features, in the same way that a skirt or dress does.  With that said, keep wearing capris if you like them don't let anybody stop you, you wild flower."
DadReflexes,2ktxj1,Falafelofagus,4,Sat Nov 1 18:24:21 2014 UTC,"And although yes capris are somewhat functional, so are cargo shorts that go below the knee.   Yes, but cargo shorts that go below the knee make you look like a Jr high kid who feels the need to carry half his personal belongings at all times. Also, cargo shorts are incredibly baggy meaning lots of loose material to get caught and snagged. Because they're so baggy they also hang loose when you kneel down, so they don't protect your knees. Capris bend with your knee, staying under the contact point.    It's not that men aren't allowed to wear them    No duh, haha. I know there isn't a law, but it's annoying having to put up with snide comments every time you wear them.    it's just that they look god awful and accentuate feminine features, in the same way that a skirt or dress does.   Uhhh... How so? Capris are basically skinny jeans chopped halfway up the shins. Dudes wear skinny jeans all the time and no one gives them crap for it. The reason you think they accentuate feminine features is because most capris you find are designed for women.   Go wear a pair of women's jeans and tell me they accentuate feminine features. I'll salute captain obvious, then hand you a pair of men's capris.   Men's capris are cut similarly to men's skinny jeans, only real difference being the short legs. They usually don't have the tapered legs that hug your legs like women's, they usually have a wider cuff, and they usually have full size pockets. The most feminine feature of women's capris is the usually skin tight legs. Men's don't have that.    With that said, keep wearing capris if you like them don't let anybody stop you, you wild flower.   Wild flower? Really? Thanks I guess. I don't think I've ever heard that term used in a positive manner."

DadReflexes,2ktxj1,auraria,5,Sun Apr 19 23:36:43 2015 UTC,"Ugh, no. Cargo shorts are for middle school kids and old dads. They don't look good, they're loose and baggy, if you load anything in the cargo pocket it slaps against your leg as you walk, and when you kneel down they don't bend with and cover/protect your knee.  Capris are low profile, so they don't snag on things as cargo shorts do.  They hug your legs so they bend with your legs, thus staying over the knees when kneeling rather than just hanging loose and open like cargo shorts.  They have standard pockets, not the dorky cargo pockets that make you look like some wannabe tactical prepper if you put anything in them.  Cargo shorts are for people who don't care what they look like as long as they've got extra pockets, and who aren't concerned about getting snagged on things."
DadReflexes,2ktxj1,downhillcarver,2,Mon Apr 20 06:08:16 2015 UTC,"But those points are only true if you shop at Target or Old Navy.  If you spend real money on cargo shorts they're tight, flexible, and aren't terrible.  Source: I'm an avid fisherman, hunter, hiker, and camper."

DadReflexes,2jeoo1,bossmcsauce,-43,Thu Jan 22 22:23:27 2015 UTC,Ugh  The game is more important than not being a total fuckface to the fans  lovely message
DadReflexes,2jeoo1,allstonwolfspider,47,Wed Oct 22 03:42:37 2014 UTC,"uuuh... yeah. maybe if the fans don't want to end up getting hit by part of the game, then they shouldn't sit on the field of play.  when you get paid a couple million a year to keep the ball on the court, yes- it's more important. It's your job."
DadReflexes,2jeoo1,KingGopher,39,Thu Oct 16 15:10:05 2014 UTC,"Yeah it's ridiculous that they allow fans and media to sit on the floor like that, not permitted in any other professional sport (I can think of) and consistently gets in the way of the game."
DadReflexes,2jeoo1,allstonwolfspider,-11,Thu Oct 16 17:54:39 2014 UTC,How does it get in the way? They are out of bounds. The game doesn't take place over there. They are not actually sitting in the area of play.
DadReflexes,2jeoo1,chunklemcdunkle,24,Thu Oct 16 19:07:47 2014 UTC,Did you watch the gif? That shit happens all the time whether it's a player trying to keep the ball in or a player finishing and running his momentum out behind the basket. It's dangerous as fuck and it's only permitted so they can sell more (really expensive) tickets.
DadReflexes,2jeoo1,SabinMoon,0,Mon Oct 20 07:54:55 2014 UTC,"The COURT itself is the area of play. These people pay thousands for tickets to sit in the danger zone.

DadReflexes,2jeoo1,wallsbecametheworld,18,Thu Oct 16 17:00:06 2014 UTC,or blame the fans that want to sit that close. Thats probably have the reason they paid 8x as much for those seats as if they had just sat up in the stadium seats.
DadReflexes,2jeoo1,bossmcsauce,8,Thu Oct 16 18:05:42 2014 UTC,Are you serious with this shit?  You think it's not OK for NBA players to dive into the crowd to make a save?
DadReflexes,2jeoo1,hobdodgeries,16,Thu Oct 16 17:58:10 2014 UTC,"for real. I'm sure the fans loved it anyway... it's exciting and thats the type of reason you pay to get to sit front row on the court like that... the chance to have the action end up in your lap.  and also, like you're probably saying, they get paid to keep the ball in play in a way that helps their team win. If I got paid a couple million a year, you can bet I'd take my job seriously. If the fans don't want to be so close to the action, maybe they shouldn't sit so fucking close. Their own fault."
DadReflexes,2jeoo1,genericname1231,13,Thu Oct 16 16:21:42 2014 UTC,people def sit there for this kind of up close stuff.

So an estimate of the distance of the total length the car travels on the screen is about 40ft. After timing the car 10 times through the screen i got an average of about .5 seconds. This gives a speed of about 80ft/sec (approx. 54mph).  It is a little harder to get the bikers speed so I took the average biking speed from google, which is 9.6 mph or approx. 14 ft/sec. I estimate her distance from the path of the car when she falls to be about 15 to 20 ft assuming the car is about 5 ft wide.  From the time she falls to the time the car passes her projected path is about 1.25 seconds.  In 1.25 seconds the girl travels 17.5 ft.

DadReflexes,2a1l3d,Sasablanca9,53,Thu Oct 9 12:30:56 2014 UTC,"Last time I saw this people said she's thinking that he faked the crying [to get more/because of the] reaction from all the adults around him. Something along the lines of ""Note that there is no pain response, despite the supposed affected area being on the lips (one of the most sensitive body parts). Then he looks around seeing the reactions, then he starts crying.""  I'm not sure how much I agree with that (edit: delayed pain is a thing, fire is hot, and a kid that age might cry over the slightest pain), but that is basically what was said in the comments when I saw it last."
DadReflexes,2a1l3d,sue-dough-nim,77,Wed Oct 15 19:47:26 2014 UTC,"I picked up what I thought was a stick out of a campfire one time, only think ""why is this stick wet?"" and then drop it a second later when I realized it was a pipe and I now had smooth fingertips.

DadReflexes,2a1l3d,Contero,23,Wed Oct 15 22:02:28 2014 UTC,"Exactly, I think when your brain isn't expecting something to hurt (or rather expecting it not to hurt), it  takes a while for it to come through. And then you have to start crying, which also takes time."
DadReflexes,2a1l3d,BW-001,10,Wed Oct 15 22:38:54 2014 UTC,"Working in the kitchen washing dishes, someone turned the water to full scalding hot while I had my back turned.

DadReflexes,2a1l3d,downhillcarver,20,Wed Oct 22 07:06:06 2014 UTC,"That's typically the case when it comes to kids. Not always, but typically. If your kid falls, there's always a second or two when they look up to you to see how they should respond. It's completely unconscious -- you're their safety net. If you make it seem like they were in danger, they'll react accordingly. If you smile and laugh about it, it's likely they will too. I think that's what is happening in this gif, but there's no real way to tell. Considering the wind was moving the flame (and it wasn't steady) and it was only there for a second, I'd say it's when the dad touched his mouth that he realized he could have been hurt."
DadReflexes,2a1l3d,HungryMoblin,9,Fri Oct 17 02:47:44 2014 UTC,"That's true and normally the case but he was  definitely too close to the flame and for a second long enough to burn his lips. Hover your lips that close to a candle for that amount of time, I bet you it hurts."
DadReflexes,2a1l3d,mymagicalbox,8,Thu Oct 23 08:03:56 2014 UTC,"I saw a great LPT on this site about how, if your kid gets some minor injury, the best thing is actually to smile because at that age children get their cues so much from other people's facial expressions. If you look all worried it's going to freak them out even more. So all other things being equal if you smile at them then things might turn out slightly better."

If you want to be a more protective parent, that's fine, but don't judge other people for not being like that.     Also, I think she knows her kid and his reactions better than you do. And she did in fact wait until she could see her son's face before she rolled her eyes."

DadReflexes,29xtt1,thedudester09,-24,Sat Sep 13 08:56:52 2014 UTC,I don't think this is stupidity. For all we know this father has been skating all his life and thought he could pull this off easily. Perhaps he has pulled it off hundreds of times with his kid in his hand and messed up once.
DadReflexes,29xtt1,phenomite1,16,Wed Oct 15 19:19:06 2014 UTC,That is the definition of stupidity.

DadReflexes,29xtt1,phenomite1,5,Wed Oct 15 21:37:01 2014 UTC,He is consistent... He consistently did something incredibly stupid until it possibly killed his child.  Just because nothing bad happened the first hundred times doesn't mean it wasn't stupid.

DadReflexes,29xtt1,phenomite1,7,Thu Oct 16 00:32:28 2014 UTC,That does not in any way make it less stupid.  I don't care if the guy was Tony Hawk it's still a ridiculously stupid thing to do
DadReflexes,29xtt1,thedudester09,-8,Thu Oct 16 01:30:00 2014 UTC,So is it stupid to throw you kid up and down in the air while catching them? Every parent does it and it's just as dangerous. Are all father's who do this stupid?

DadReflexes,29xtt1,phenomite1,5,Thu Oct 16 01:07:13 2014 UTC,"So say you're an experienced tight rope walker.  You've done it a million times and you're damn good at it.

DadReflexes,29xtt1,coitusFelcher,-6,Mon Oct 20 01:33:14 2014 UTC,"That is a terrible analogy because the dangers of skating aren't nearly as prevalent as the dangers of tight roping across the grand canyon.

So this is the best option. But here either this kid is flopping around or they didnt realy pay attention to how they put it in the cart and they didnt buckle the kid in.. so there were indeed some dumb things that had to happen. But thank god superman works nights at home depot or this would be a very different post."

I glanced over the top of the movies as a father walked by with a baby in his arms.  I'm not really sure what happened, but I just remember seeing the baby fall from his arms and hit the floor with a loud THUD!  I don't know if the kid was injured. There wasn't any blood on the floor from the impact. But it was just an infant...so hitting his head on the tile floor couldn't have been good.  I can still clearly hear the sound of his head bouncing off the floor. It still makes cringe."

""Tort Reform"" as it has been labelled is just another attempt to take legal power away from everyday citizens and increase barriers to legal action.   According to the Rand Institute for Civil Justiceonly 10% of people injured in America seek compensation, and only 2% of them file lawsuits.   Here are some other quick stats from the same group:   Personal injury lawsuits represent only 1.3 percent of all civil dispositions.  From 1992 to 2005, jury trials in personal injury cases have seen a 52 percent decrease.  A survey of judges in Texas, where tort reform support runs high, found that 86 percent of them felt there was no need for legislation to limit lawsuits.    Would you like to know more?"

DadReflexes,29rb6i,ComeAtMeFro,91,Thu Jul 3 23:47:58 2014 UTC,The worst is that it's probably just a well educated kid who thought ''I have to give them their ball back.''.

In that moment the kid felt thousands on eyes on him, and his anxiety told him that everyone was waiting for him to throw it back. So he did.

I don't entirely know why I'm telling you this, just seemed sort of relevant to what you said and I was reminded, feel obligated to share in case the information has a chance of helping somebody involved in a crash.  tl;dr: Don't assume people who hit their heads are alright just because they look like it."

He pushed the little girl in the car in 0.000003 s to save her. On the other hand the driver who hit him thought he was the only road-user in the whole (Greater) Russia and droce like an idiot and thus he couldn't be prepared for a standstill car in the middle of the road.
