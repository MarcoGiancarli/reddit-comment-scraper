And the rest is already fine as is.  Royality - the slow progressiveness of the drums and low-frequency bass and that buildup of that not-so-noticeable trap synth. Then that buildup to that familiar midi with the orgasmic unique synth that has everyone singing along then drops into a dubstep-type of drop with the riff and some funky wubs and voices playing as well as that 8bit sample that plays 4 times along with the drop. Then breaks down into that fancy synth again with the riff sounding even more powerful and easier to sing along to (with the midi being slightly modified but still catchy). Then 70s pop-type kicks slide in to make us jump then drops into the 2nd to best drop of the track featuring orgasmic wubs and samples and the midi that is mixed into what is deserved to be what it is. Then drops into the best drop of the track with the bass and wubs and samples becoming more complex and the midi sounding more alive and complex as well then breaks down into a softer drop with the same midi playing then into the drums with the apreggic trance chords damn rape on the spot. Then drops into a slightly out of theme full-time drop with such weird wubs and samples. Then into... (To be continued since I'm too busy and lazy for this right now lol) (but so far I love started a remix FLP of this including a piano version of the midi of royality)"

Savant,3d5omv,Noswad92002,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"I think that ""problematicalcucalculatorture"" (don't quote me on that) sounds a bit glitched; maybe an emotion could be distressed or in need of help?"

Savant,3d7cph,oranebeast,2,Tue Jul 14 02:20:06 2015 UTC,Honestly this subreddit is already /r/Savantcirclejerk at times. Have you seen the sidebar?
Savant,3d7cph,Carpetfreak,3,Tue Jul 14 04:26:44 2015 UTC,The sidebar is the best
Savant,3d7cph,Nath_O,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:48:55 2015 UTC,We might as well keep it all in this sub. It's not like it's getting flooded with posts. And you have more of an audience here than you will with a specific sub.
Savant,3d7cph,Eddyman,6,Tue Jul 14 09:03:49 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Let's keep this sub for Savant shit only. I feel like if we allow everyone to promote their music we'll get flooded with shitty chiptune music made by 12 year old ""producers"" (no offence)."
Savant,3d7cph,Daggerlike,3,Tue Jul 14 10:47:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. This sub is named /r/Savant after all"
Savant,3d7cph,BaTmAn9785,2,Tue Jul 14 15:32:42 2015 UTC,Oh yeah you're right. When I wrote that I was just thinking savant based songs. If it's going to be nothing to do with Savant there should be a different sub.

Savant,3d2xrx,Zarwil,2,Mon Jul 13 02:36:50 2015 UTC,He stated that it'd be released around the time the actual game drops. Which will hopefully be this year. You can check out a better quality version in the meantime on the SFR channel or elsewhere on YouTube.

Savant,3czt87,Emral,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:32:38 2015 UTC,This was the most excited I have ever been for a music release (not an exaggeration). I might even like the teaser more than the album itself.
Savant,3czt87,Name0fTheUser,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:05:31 2015 UTC,"This album came out while I was on vacation at a cabin in West Virginia. I remember riding my bike down to the lobby on the day of the release so that I could be in wi-fi and download it...it was all I listened to that day. I was so excited to hear Cry For Love that it was the first thing I listened to...it almost made me cry, it was so beautiful."
Savant,3czt87,Carpetfreak,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:43:35 2015 UTC,I remember when I first heard this album. The first song I had heard Wes Lazer Sharks. I was playing Diablo with some friends and we liked it so much we put it on repeat for a good 6 hours.. I absolutely adore this album!
Savant,3d0ccb,Sire7,3,Sun Jul 12 12:39:54 2015 UTC,"He announced a VIP ""project"" on facebook yesterday, I would grab the link but mobile won't let me."
Savant,3d0ccb,NouiomoOnyx,2,Mon Jul 13 15:20:27 2015 UTC,"Probably stupid question, but is there a different meaning to VIP I'm not getting? Or is it just VIP because the songs get a new remix?"
Savant,3d0ccb,Prutzle,2,Mon Jul 13 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"The term ""VIP"" in the music scene stands for Variation in Production."

Savant,3cvwka,ThoughtfullyReckless,2,Sat Jul 11 07:06:52 2015 UTC,Well this is kind of weird.  I love Savant above and beyond but this isnt hitting with me.  Any idea if this was made after Cult's release?  Its practically the same song and has me thinking it was a VIP for the same album like he didnt know which one he wanted to put on the album and had options.  Its just not different enough to be a post-Cult release VIP.
Savant,3cvwka,pattyfritters,3,Sat Jul 11 05:43:11 2015 UTC,"""An edit I made for the music video, but we ended up using the original. But this one has some punch."""
Savant,3cvwka,Eddyman,2,Sat Jul 11 06:06:12 2015 UTC,Ahh that's why it's so similar.  Thanks for the update.
Savant,3cvwka,pattyfritters,1 point,Sat Jul 11 06:09:35 2015 UTC,I don't think this version would have fit the video at all so I'm glad they went with the original.
Savant,3cvwka,Eddyman,2,Sat Jul 11 06:10:34 2015 UTC,Same.  Not to mention the uproar that would have been caused by changing it.  People still wanted that good ol' Kali 47...just with a music video haha.  We all saw what happened when he changed a few Invasion songs after the teaser was released.  Everyone lost their minds because it wasn't the same.
Savant,3cvwka,pattyfritters,2,Sat Jul 11 06:14:20 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool. I believe he has a different VIP version of Kali 47 too. He also has a VIP version of Butterfly, Splinter, and Valkyrie as well."
Savant,3cvwka,NO_OBS,1 point,Sat Jul 11 14:19:47 2015 UTC,With this and that weird Invasion reject and the Blanco remix it seems like we're getting back to Savant's crazy release schedule.

Savant,3cvv1k,Brayconn,2,Sat Jul 11 05:20:30 2015 UTC,"Eh... The end of that song matches the feel of the end of the album pretty well.  Like around Desperado and Massacre.  Had he actually tried to finish it, it probably would have been all right.  But then again, the end of it has a very Valley of Shadows feel from Orakel.  I think I even hear similar sounds and samples like the mario coin blip thing."

Savant gon keep doin his thing He's just reviving Blanco cause it's hella been long (from my research) from 2010 probably. Just be excited man, it kinda sounds Savant-Dubish but ofcourse its all deep house (120-135 bpm) so far from the teasers from NO_OBS' soundcloud and going to SF to see him live, sounds a little faster than regular electro. Like 134ish. But shit it's still gonna be bouncy and catchy from what I can tell. Definitely be willing to buy it (Tbh I dunno if it's free or with a price can anyone say?)  Sucks that it's still not released and 7/7 passed already :( Wait a minute... Then again 7+8 equals 15 :D TODAYs gonna be the day I hope lol. Think I'm gonna stay up a few more hours since its past 12 already. Anyways Savant DID say on his Twitter that he wanted to quit EDM forever, but comon Savants a joker bro xD Plus he was probably high.  Don't be fooled by others telling you that son. Whoever replied to you or me on this subreddit who defies my argument and believes he is quitting EDM should not be listened to at all. Trust me bro.  Blanco previously I heard and I'm not a fan of it but seeing Savant right now in his improvements in his music this albums gonna kick the shit outta your ears and fill them with catastrophic joy :)  So yeah get hyped for possibly today, in fact it could be any moment right now. Probably got released right now as I'm still typing at this moment lol."

Savant,3cafoh,WickeDanneh,2,Mon Jul 6 21:44:52 2015 UTC,"Reddit is declining in popularity, particularly from the controversy from earlier this week, and some of the users have migrated to Voat. Whether it's because it's new or not, I really enjoy Voat despite being similar to Reddit."
Savant,3cajam,LordAjo,3,Mon Jul 6 11:44:23 2015 UTC,"I believe based /u/NO_OBS runs the reboot, the guy that ran the original disappeared and the channel could not be accessed. So NO_OBS started a new one. He will show up in this thread soon, he's around a lot."

As for your original question, I've obtained a multitude of tracks from various sources. These include things such as the Internet Archive, MySpace, Torrent sites, Live sets from various shows, and so on. I have also obtained a few tracks from people who used to frequent the old SectionZ website before its community track sharing feature was removed."

But anyways keep it up, but I also wonder what happened to the guy who ran the original Savantfans channel? Is he still active in the internet or wha?"
Savant,3cajam,NO_OBS,2,Mon Jul 6 20:26:47 2015 UTC,Last I saw he was posting about how he was updating the fan website to make it look better for the release of Orakel. You can checkout his reddit account /u/savantfans too.
Savant,3c995z,Carpetfreak,5,Mon Jul 6 02:13:19 2015 UTC,I really like the intense sci-fi feel of Stargate more than a few other songs on his Orakel album.  It is somehow deeply inspirational with a fine melody up until the rough mechanized bass rhythm of the second half of the song while sticking to the beat.  Recommendation for next SOTW: ♥
Savant,3c995z,Prof_Stranglebater,3,Mon Jul 6 11:52:53 2015 UTC,I like the varying distortion/frequency of the part at the start. It doesn't get too high and uncomfortable sounding. And the melody just before the hard stuff has such a nice happy feeling to it. It's all very nice.  Suggestion: You Can Play
Savant,3c995z,TheManGuyFella,2,Wed Jul 8 11:14:58 2015 UTC,"the opening drums of this song are absolutely incredible, they're so deep and have an incredible sonic quality when played on a powerful audio system.  the ending piano notes are also blissful.  one thing i could have done without, though, was the link 'yeah!' samples ... really didn't belong in a song that he himself described as being about 'space travel'"
Savant,3c995z,democratic_anarchist,2,Wed Jul 8 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"Wow. This is the first time I have listened to this song, and I have so many things to write about! From the first enticing drum beat all the way to the ending piano chords, this song screams space, whether preparation for space travel, liftoff, or just the thrill of exploration, I feel like this song covers all those emotions! The best thing about it, I think, is the progression from dnb to an amazing baseline to chords to piano. Truly amazing.   Suggestion: Spaceheart (Protos)"

Sucked for people in Avalon on June 26, it was 19+ -__- Why the fuck would the staff there think of such a cruel number to use upon newly turned adults who should have a right to attend ""mature"" clubs!? Smh  Anyways bro glad I could help. You could get a fake ID and risk getting arrested and thrown into state prison with a bunch of thugs, but I'd say just wait til you're 18 or just wait for more shows from savant, most of them probably are all ages.

In fact I'm so volatile I just got dropped by my doctor because she was too liable to be sued over my death. Seriously I want to die so fucking bad it's all I think about but I really love Savants music and I'd hate to miss whatever he makes next.

I don't count that due to the fact it was forced upon people, people didn't willingly accept the album, they were just given it, making the title disingenuous. That's kind of the same thing for me.

Savant,3by94o,dannytheboss11,7,Fri Jul 3 03:40:54 2015 UTC,"Do the math please.  500 tracks in a 5 minute track would mean 100 tracks per minute... That's more than one track /per second/.  Which means, you're going to barely be able to fit in a single beat from every song, much less any riffs or interesting things from every one.  In a 10 minute track it'd be a lot more plausible because you'd have 10 songs per minute, which gives each one more around 1 track per second.  Even then, though, it'd be very difficult to make it sound listenable."
Savant,3by94o,Viomi,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:58:28 2015 UTC,"Your math is wrong. 500 tracks in 5 minutes would be 1.67 tracks per second, and in 10 minutes it would be 0.83 tracks per second, so each track would last 1.2 seconds."
Savant,3by94o,Name0fTheUser,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:30:54 2015 UTC,"500 / 5 = 100 tracks per minute.  100 tracks / 60 seconds = 1.67 tracks per second.  1.67 tracks per second means in order to play every track, you'd have to play MORE THAN ONE TRACK EVERY SECOND.

Here's a sneak peak at what one of the tracks: Fly Away With Me, an Unfinished Business remake, sounds like."
Savant,3bmn99,Fak3Cake,0,Wed Jul 1 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"No no, you are wrong indeed. Blanco EP is just a name we assigned for his future release under Blanco's alias. Ronin is another different album in colaboration with Donny Goines I think. These are different albums, so we expect 3 releases this year"
Savant,3bmn99,Xxviii_28,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:12:04 2015 UTC,RIP Aleksander Vinter 2015...  so much has been promised. yet all I got are waterfalls of tears..
Savant,3bmn99,shadowchaosxx,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:09:29 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of it is how popular he's become. In 2011 and the start of 2012, he was very much underground. Shut in the studio without all the distractions and touring, all of his mind was on the music.  But now, he's globally recognised. Playing shows every week and flying all over the planet takes it out of you. So studio time and creative energy suffer massively.  My prediction: Savant will retire after Vex and go back underground with Blanco and his other side projects. Then in a year or so, when there's no more shows to be played and a tonne of musical stew bubbling up in his brain, he'll release a massive new Savant record that blows the rest of his discography sky high.  That's the dream anyway ;)"
Savant,3bmn99,dannytheboss11,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:30:39 2015 UTC,"I made a thread about it a few days ago about how he's slower. and yeah I agree, let's not forget people: we're NOT ""complaining"" because we're being impatient or anything, it's because him producing so fast was one of his main QUALITIES that really used to differentiate himself from other artists, people would be impressed by it and that's how many people started liking him so much and followed him to this day. his quality/quantity level was so high, and nowadays he's only going for quality, which in my opinion is reducing as well. I still find alchemist to be the most diverse EDM album he's ever made, it was so unique...from redemption to hungry eyes to the alchemist, everything was different and amazing. and that was back when he produced so much. but guys, let's be honest...not many artists really keep their quantity and quality as soon as they get more popular, will Savant be any different I wonder? we don't know I guess. not only EDM artists, but also happens to any kind of bands."
Savant,3bmn99,Fak3Cake,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:40:38 2015 UTC,"I feel you brotha, Throughout beginning my discovery of him in about Nov 2012, and then looking back on his historic background of his music (not gonna include his other aliases ex. ViH) 2012 was probably the most productive year of Aleks xD 4 albums (and an EP + shitton of singles) in a year is fuckin spasmatically satisfying xD 2013 was, I'd say, better than ok, with 2 albums, an EP, 5 russefeiring tracks and few singles 2014 wasn't his best, in fact probably the laziest I feel he did xD No new album til the 2nd half of the year and it was rock instead of dubstep (for you ignorant mainstream fuckers) but still out of the blue uncomfortable for the rest of us, and a final EDM treat at the end.  The start of this year got me hyped with Invasion and now Im waiting for Vex which is basically a sequel to Protos, Imma be honest lol, and a new alias release so yeee so Id say Savant is turning away from us dubsteppers/EDMers as of 2014 and slowly turning into what mainstream dickheads would say ""boring Mozart/deadmau5 eww >.<"" xD  I wouldn't say depressing (kinda is but accept it cause he is Savant) but yknow I support his outtake on the music industry and refuse to believe hes quitting EDM rumors would say.  If he does quit for reals, IMMEDIATE UNFOLLOW, UNLIKE, START SPAMMING ON HIS PAGE ""EWW YOURE BORING AND STUPID, MAKE SOME DUBSTEP ALBUM YOU PIECE OF SOFT SHIT, and tell him to quit his act of ""being a pussy in music"" the major percentage of edm would say. Nah Im playin I'd support him no matter what but cmon that's some bs savant would play on us xD"
Savant,3bi5nj,Carpetfreak,3,Mon Jun 29 12:33:45 2015 UTC,"All time favorite song, I feel in love with it the first time i heard it."
Savant,3bi5nj,demonsrun0,3,Mon Jun 29 19:31:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks for picking my suggestion! I must admit, the first time I listened to the track the intro kinda put me off, and I didn't even take the time to listen to the whole track. It was only later that I listened to it in whole, and realized just how great this track is. The different styles in the drops all work great, especially the hardstyle-esque one. The sound design is just really on point, the same with the other 4 tracks released in the same period of time (Amerika, Mellow, Veritech and Rude Gal). One of the best non-album Savant releases by far."
Savant,3bi5nj,JonnyGG,2,Tue Jun 30 21:54:47 2015 UTC,yes yes yes... such an amazing song
Savant,3bi5nj,nuckadamus,2,Tue Jun 30 03:33:38 2015 UTC,"I love this track: as well as being a really memorable tune and having two seriously good drops (the ones at 1:09 and 2:31), it sounds like what it's conveying -- the track is chilled out and spacy, and it's all wrapped together with a fantastic chip melody. This is probably my favourite track Aleks has released for free.  Next week: Stargate."

Savant,3b61bn,fuck-nexus,4,Thu Jul 2 21:54:07 2015 UTC,"He's still very much an underground artist. One would most likely need to be actively searching to find most of his music, as it is not advertised anywhere (save maybe a few youtube videos). He's gaining more and more traction recently. He's actually started being booked by festivals which is very promising, but he's still one of those ""small text"" names on the posters, if at all.  Savant, though, has a bit of a cult following which is why it may seem like he is more popular than he actually is. He doesn't often tap into the ""mainstream"" sound, so it's tough for him to be noticed these days, but hey there's people like Bassnectar who also have a cult following and basically defines his own genres and he's one of the biggest in EDM history... so anything can happen."

Savant,3b61bn,numpad,3,Fri Jun 26 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"savant has also been ""promoted"" by big youtubers like Cryaotic (to this day still) but what I've noticed is that back in 2012, 2013 he had way more channels who promoted music to upload his music, and many of his songs got ton of views. I think that really helped him, but nowadays only less popular channels upload his songs. I don't know if it's his choice or not, but I'd love seeing his songs on many music promotion channels again. it was always a way of getting more people to know his music...I don't think he should rely only on UKF."

I don't understand how these asshats like Skrillex become a household name, but barely anyone I know knows of Savant. I guess that could be a good thing though.  Often times being mainstream, can hinder an artist.   I went to see him at a show recently. Wasn't a very large city ...but still.. Most of the crowd was kids who didn't know who he is. They were only there because OMG I LOVE EDM. Savant should be selling out shows with his talent   He'll gain more momentum, just give him time. The man is freaking genius."

Savant,3atz6g,fuck-nexus,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:00:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think Sian would exist without Savant, so many of his sounds are obviously heavily influenced by him. And I also think Sian is a little bit in denial about this fact. Granted, Sian's newest album Gravitalia is definitely an evolution and has more of a uniquely Sian feel. But Sian has pointed fingers at other artists on facebook who he has accused of stealing music, and then he goes and releases his newest single Make Me Crazy and lifts Middle Milk's ""Disco"" sample directly into it. This Ninur thing is looking to continue a trend of fan-tribute blurring into blatant copying... Sian's got to grow up a little bit still. :/  At any rate I'm going to continue buying his work and I'd totally go see him if he played somewhere nearby. :p"

Savant,3at13g,Carpetfreak,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"The most noticeable change in my opinion is that the voice isn't sped up any more, and sounds quite normal -- something which Aleks hates to have present in songs.  Same goes for Mother Earth, Vario 64, and Party Machine.  There are likely others, but those I have tested."

Savant,3alx4p,shadowchaosxx,12,Sun Jun 21 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, touring is one reason he's become slower. 2014 and 2015 seem to have been touring for the first half, and studio for the second half.  However, newer Savant songs are also way more refined than his 2012 works, at least in my opinion. I feel like he puts much more heart into his work and thrives to make each album as unique and as good as possible. I was way more excited for Zion or Protos to come out than I was for Cult or Orakel (been around since the release of ISM for perspective)."
Savant,3alx4p,Emral,2,Sun Jun 21 14:54:44 2015 UTC,"Yes you make some good points. but since savant's fans all have their taste on different music due to Savant having a huge variety, many people didn't like Protos so it automatically became only 1 album for them in 2014 (being Zion) I have a feeling that the same thing might happen this year with Vex, some people will love it, some will hate it. while we are excited for Vex, I'm sure many savant fans aren't. so they'll have to wait even longer than us for another album."
Savant,3alx4p,Emral,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:19:34 2015 UTC,"Blanco EP coming any day now, so that's gonna please many people who don't like Savant's current direction. And if Blanco's EP is well received, I think Savant is going to make more of them, creating an EDM sidepath next to his personal evolution."
Savant,3alx4p,Subsistentyak,3,Sun Jun 21 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"In addition to much higher synth detail in his newer works, I think he's ran through almost all of the stuff he's already come up with. I'm pretty sure he's saved riffs and melodies all throughout learning to make music, and over the start of his career it was easier to pick and choose ones that went together in an album. Now I think he's just about out of those and has to come up with more new stuff than before, and judging from the synth quality on Zion, he's taking much more time on mastering tracks than before."
Savant,3alx4p,LordAjo,1 point,Sun Jun 21 19:40:53 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah... I almost forgot, even though I think some albums (Zion, Invasion) are not his best works, I love all the music Aleks maxes! I really really loved Protos, because I didn't expected such a big change! And I think I expected something very different from Zion than it was, so obviously I was dissapointed. And that's why I am going to let myself be surprised with whatever is to come! That way I won't be sad later"

Hopefully what wil to come from now on is going to be good stuff, because as far as I know, Vex, Blanco and Ronin are going to be really good works and he's working hard on them... So yeah! Let's be pacient and positive about all this!"
Savant,3alx4p,Felinski,4,Sun Jun 21 16:57:50 2015 UTC,"wow, Zion and invasion was bad? man everyone to your own opinion but there's nothing bad with those albums imo"

I'm personally more into his catchy and fun melodies, some are into vocals, some are into the heaviness and so on!"
Savant,3aiqp3,Toblabob,3,Sat Jun 20 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"[Let me just preface this by saying that all of the ones I list as the ""weakest"" tracks are tracks I still really like*.]  Ninur: Make You Dream is the strongest because it sums up the album's general heavy dubstep sound in a unique and memorable fashion; Holy Ghost is the weakest in my opinion because it does that same heavy dubstep sound but in a pretty unmemorable way.  Vario: Mecha Blecka is the strongest because of its wonderful melody (a lot of Vario's tracks have great melodies honestly) and the way it so effortlessly flows between segments. Burgertime is the weakest because of the goofy samples that kind of get on my nerves at times and the fact that as a song it just doesn't really stand out to me that much.  Overworld: Dirty Mary is the strongest because it's just so indescribably perfect; acoustic guitar, video game-esque bloops and blops, a beautiful melody...the first Savant song I ever heard and still a great one. Quantum Mechanics is the weakest because the robotic bass gets a bit boring after a while.  ISM: 8-Bit Lightsaber is the strongest because of its fantastic melody and its flawless execution of chiptune dubstep; Mystery is the weakest because I just don't find it that memorable.  Overkill: Wade In The Water is the strongest; so chilling and atmospheric and yet so brilliant and dance-able. As for the weakest, I have to say the title track simply because I'm really not a metal person and it just feels so meandering and boring...I know a lot of people will say that Aces Sleeved is the weakest on Overkill but at least that song was tight, controlled, and interesting.   Alchemist: Konami Kode is the strongest because I feel like it's the most ""video gamey"" thing he's ever done; Donny Goine's engaging delivery and delightfully over-the-top punchlines fit perfectly with the beat and make it just an overall fun song. I agree with /u/KaiserTom that Manslaughter is the weakest track; even though I do like it I feel like the drop is kind of underwhelming and he could have done more with the melody.  Cult: I think Forbidden is the strongest track because...just...damn, that melody! Plus it's just so dark and creepy-sounding that it's hard not to love it. Chop It is probably the weakest because, even though I do really like it (particularly Gino Sydal's vocals), it sort of feels like it doesn't really go anywhere with its trap style, and I say that as someone who really likes trap.  Orakel: Origin is the strongest track because of its vocals and just how beautifully unique it is. Rave Life is the weakest because it feels kinda boring and lengthy.   Protos: Cry For Love is the strongest because it's so damn smooth and such a brilliant callback to ISM. Nebula is the weakest because...I don't know, I just really can't get into it very easily.  Zion: Strongest is definitely Outcasts...such a beautiful and smooth track, I love the piano and the vocal samples. Weakest is probably Arrival because of how repetitive and simple it is.  Invasion: Upgrade is the strongest because of how well it transitions from progressive house to electro house to big room house and how great the melody is. Pizza Power Alien is the weakest because it's so corny and the drop is so underwhelming.  *except Pizza Power Alien"
Savant,3aiqp3,Carpetfreak,7,Sat Jun 20 20:08:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to go by what I think the strongest and weakest are, rather, my favorite and least favorite tracks from each album.  Ninur: Best: You Can Play. Just a really, really fun song that makes me want to dance.  Worst: Rabbit Whore. Not a fan of the vocals on this song at all, as a song it's honestly just okay, but I find the vocals annoying enough to make this song the worst on Ninur.  Alchemist:  Best: Melody Circus. An amazing lighthearted song with complex melodies throughout it's entirety. It was actually the first Savant song that I head, and it made me fall in love with his music, so this one's an obvious best for me.  Worst: Konami Code. I just... HATE it. It's the vocals. Not the vocalist... but the lyrics themselves. They are clever, but they're just shallow and ugh ugh ugh! Also, the Konami Code doesn't have a select in it. That really irks me.  ISM:  Best: ISM. Hands down. Once again, because it's just an overall really nice song with lots of catchy melodies that just plain make me plain happy. I could listen to it on repeat. Close second to Cry For Love, good song, that.  Worst: I don't particularly dislike any songs on this album, but if I had to choose, it would be Outfox. Just a pretty bland song. Not hard to listen to by any means, though.  Overworld:  Best: Dirty Mary. I don't think many people would consider this one of the best songs on Overworld, but I love it. It has a slow atmospheric buildup and then an emotionally heavy drop that just really speaks to me. I f*cking love the mario fireball sounds near the start of the drop, haha. Shoutouts to Destroy The Dragon. Crazy song.  Worst: Quantum Mechanics. If I could an assign a word to this song, I'd call it annoying. It just sounds like random sounds to me. Not my style at all.  Vario:  Best: Hero From The Past. Zelda WOOO! Seriously love this song. It makes me want to go punch the bad guys. I absolutely love the oscillators in the song, they just sound really bubbly and pretty to me and I adore it for so many reasons.  Worst: Heartshaped Mushroom Cloud. Too grimey for me. Just... ick. The sounds of this song just sound like somebody's drowning in a puddle of muddy water. Not a fan.  Cult:  Best: Robin Hood! Dem harpsichords at the start, doe. I fcking love this song. It's an absolute blast. It just feels like a crazy adventure all over the place, it feels like a long and epic story unfolding in my eardrums. And the drums... them rolling drums. *Shudders. Great song.  Worst: Chop It. I don't hate it, but I don't love it. Not much else to say about it.  Orakel:   Best: Spacewolfe. Just yes. Yes. If I could describe this song with only one word, I'd call it inspirational. And the chorus in this song towards the end sends chills down my spine. One of my favorite Savant tracks for all the right reasons. Also, Orakel right before this song leading into it is awesome. If Orakel was a longer, more full song, I'd honestly say that it was my favorite, because I love the orchestral nature of it. But since it's not, I pick Spacewolfe.  Worst: Penguins. This album is another one where none of the songs really stick out like a sore thumb to me. I'm having trouble picking, so I'll just choose penguins... because. I don't know.  Overkill:  I don't know. I don't have any best/worsts for this album. Honestly, I'd probably end up changing my mind if I had to choose, so I'm just not going to.  Protos:  Best: Man of the Law. I think it represents this album perfectly, and it's an awesome opening track. I mean, what's not to love about it? The guitar solo in the middle. Right on man, right on. """"Make your life like you make your dreams... gotta make it real"". <3  Worst: Tie between Fakers/Venom. I just don't like the lyrics in these songs. Recurring theme? I can't put my finger on exactly why I don't like them... they just strike the wrong kind of chord in me.  Zion:  Best: I REALLY want to pick royalty, because I absolutely ADORE the buildup and middle portion of this song... but I'm honestly not a fan of how it drops off, so I'm not too sure. I'll pick Apocalypse instead, with Arrival/Mecca tying for a close second. Apocalypse just really hypes me up. It's badass in all the right ways. Good stuff.  Worst: Meshugga. This is another one of those songs that just sounds like random sounds for the most part, to me. Not a big fan.  Invasion:  Best: Orphan! I feel like I have a strong bias for the tracks that are at/near the start of albums for the most part... but, I really do love this song. It has an atmospheric buildup similar to Dirty Mary, but a much more fun drop that reminds me of songs like Melody circus, and keeps it up throughout the rest of the song. Good.  Worst: Trap Slut. It's obnoxious. Absolutely obnoxious. Do I need to say anything else?  Also, it's not an album, but I have to say this anyways... Siren from the Heart EP. That song is really mindblowing. It's the most emotional Savant song to me, and it's one of my favorite songs ever, so I have to add it to this list.  I hope you guys don't hate me for hating on so many songs... haha. I'm pretty picky in music, and I actually wasn't a fan of electronic music before I listened to Savant. And that means a lot, because I went from someone who didn't really like electronic music, to absolutely loving it. Most of Savant's music is incredible. He makes so much music, that there's bound to always be a few tracks that you just really don't like."
Savant,3aiqp3,Origination,2,Sat Jun 20 19:07:39 2015 UTC,"Protos: Best: Man of Law, it pretty much embodies the entire album right from the start.  Worst: Venom, the song just feels lacking and too slow compared to the rest of the album.  Alchemist: Best: Alchemist of course, with Bananonymous in close second. They are very melodic and there's so much to hear within the songs themselves.  Worst: I never could come to like Manslaughter, even Witchcraft was enjoyable just because of how stupidly abrasive it was. Manslaughter was just overly mediocre to me, truly sounded more like a crappy pop song to me than anything.  Invasion: Best: 1997, 9 minutes of pure techno and I'm not really sure what it is about it that makes it so awesome. Maybe it's how it drops and picks up multiple times throughout the song.  Worst: Trap Slut easily, just obnoxious to listen to more than anything. Not really enjoyable at all.  Those are the only three I am confident in answering right now, I'll need to listen to the others just by themselves to get a better idea of their best/worsts."
Savant,3aiqp3,KaiserTom,1 point,Sat Jun 20 17:49:43 2015 UTC,I actually really like the first part of trap slut but it does become irritating later in the song. Really agree with you on 1997 though. Probably my fave savant song of all time.
Savant,3aiqp3,jpark217,2,Sun Jun 21 12:03:27 2015 UTC,"I'll do the 4 most recent because I'm most falmiliar with them. I should probably listen to the others more often.  Protos:  Best: Venom. The lyrics, man. Out of all songs on Protos, the lyrics in this one are the strongest, and combined with the melody they make for a rather emotional experience.  Worst: Nebula doesn't quite tie in with the rest of the album and there's barely anything special about it IMO. Maybe that's just me?  Invasion:  Best: The album's theme is ""not following any rules and going all over the place"". Every track is different, but Basement is the embodiment of Invasion IMO with upbeat and quite different melodies.  Worst: Trap Slut. Or maybe that's just because I can't listen to this song without forcing myself.  Zion:  Best: Mecca. Although many songs in Zion are incredibly strong and do well at delivering a subtle message, this one does it best. I can clearly hear the theme of the album (which Aleks once said was political and religious conflict in the middle east) present in this song.  Worst: Outcast doesn't follow the Zion formula as being the only calm song on the album.  Orakel:  Best: Due to the versatility of the album, I find it difficult to pinpoint a certain song which represents the album, other than Orakel itself. It's nothing minblowing but sets the undertone for the entire album and is a fitting introduction which directly leads into Spacewolfe. I'd put these two together here if I was allowed to.  Worst: After noticing how many songs I actually forgot from this album, I'd have to go with either Penguins or Legacy. I can't fully decide between them, but both just don't fit with the rest of the album IMO."
Savant,3aiqp3,Emral,2,Sat Jun 20 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"Vario: Best: Fuck Nexus. It just stands out from the rest of the album, and it's one of the few tracks i can still fully enjoy from Vario.  Worst: Shadow. Vocals are pretty annoying, and don't fit exactly with the rest of the music IMO. not to mention it's almost 6 minutes long  Overworld: Best: Firecloud. Now, I have heard many people hating on this track, on how it's repetitive and long, but as someone who listened to progressive house for the past few years it's fine with me, so that's just my opinion. Anyway: The main melody is really catchy, the drops are varied and special in their own way, so I say it's my favorite from Overworld, even though Vinter is also amazing.  Worst: I'm tempted to say Flashbach because it's way too simplistic and boring, but it's ending redeemed itself. So for this album I say there is none. All of it's tracks are amazing in their own way.  Overkill: Best: Wildstyle. Really hyping and just makes you wanna dance.  Worst: Overkill. Just not my thing I guess.  ISM: Best: EVERYTHING!! But since I have to choose one, I'll say ISM. Catchy, it's structure is really good, and the drop is amazing.  Worst: Umm, guess Cry for love. Now don't take me wrong, I love it, but it's just not as great as the other tracks.  Alchemist: Best: No Time For Pussy. It's just a fun song to listen to. Pretty melody, has bunch of cool little sound here and there, and the ""Sorry, no time for pussy"" just makes it stand out more. I must mention Redemtion as well. Just so uplifting and Simple.  Worst: Sledgehammer. The drop is kinda painful for the ears, and since it's most of the track, I got tired of it pretty fast."
Savant,3aiqp3,4Anket2,2,Sun Jun 21 11:14:12 2015 UTC,"Invasion:  Strongest: Pizza Power Alien. Has a really strong intro + drop and an amazing melody near the end.  Weakest: Problemathematicalculatorture. Very effect heavy but not very interesting.  Zion:  Strongest: Meshugga. Don't know why I like it so much.  Weakest: Apocalypse. I actually really like the melody but it's basically duplicated five times and not stitched together that well.  Protos:  Strongest: Man of the Law. Full of beautiful melodies and uplifting vocals.  Weakest: Quest. Feels like a bunch of weak mini songs squished together. Some parts are enjoyable though.  Orakel:  Strongest: Origin. Slightly cheesy, but hits the spot.  Weakest: Penguins. I REALLY don't like the voice sample.  Cult:  Strongest: Nightowl. Probably the coolest and weirdest song he's made.  Weakest: Virgin. Feels much less polished and realized than the rest of the tracks. Can't Touch This at least has an edge to it.  Heart:  Strongest: Step Up Your Game. Unlike anything I've ever heard and still perfect in so many ways.  Weakest: Too difficult to decide.  Overkill:  Strongest: Big Ben. Really clean and minimal. Too bad the song length is also minimal.  Weakest: Almost all the rest.  Alchemist:  Strongest: Alchemist. Such a fun song with tons of energy.  Weakest: Dancer in the Dark. Overly shrieky.  ISM:  Strongest: Starfish. Consistently good.  Weakest: Syko. The main lead is painful to listen to, especially when the bpm increases near the end.  Overworld:  Strongest: Overworld. Barrage of really cool and energetic moments.  Weakest: Firecloud. Loooooong and barely a single good moment.  Vario:  Strongest: Burgertime. Such a bizarre combination of sounds that work perfectly together.  Weakest: Heart-Shaped Mushroom Cloud. It's not even bad, but something had to go here.  Ninur:  Strongest: You Can Play. Really love the way it opens with the organ and harpsichord.  Weakest: Rabbit Whore. The breakdowns are really cool, but the singing ruins it for me.  Outbreak:  Strongest: Anyone? Normally I don't care about lyrics, but there's something special about this one.  Weakest: Bad Love. Doesn't stand out much, but it's not bad.  Mamachine:  Strongest: Kloser. Soooo chillll.  Weakest: Vowov. Overly loud and abrasive, but it does have one of the coolest moments: ""use you imagination..."""

Savant,3a8xcw,cvfunstuff,4,Thu Jun 18 04:03:56 2015 UTC,"I saw him in Zürich in April and got to meet him backstage but that was because I won VIP tickets to the club so. He's a really amazing guy but if you meet him, just a suggestion, he gets really uncomfortable when lots of people try to talk to him at once. So be respectful, wait your turn and just treat him like someone you admire but dont go acting like its the biggest deal ever. The guy I was with came on too strong and it was clear the 'you're a fan and im the artist' wall came up pretty quick."

If I remember back a bit, I started with those two, then moved to alchemist, then all of them...  I'll recommend some random killer tracks that I like too, to help (no particular order, but I think these aren't a bad place to start):   Starfish - ISM Splinter - Vario Dirty Mary - Overworld Bananonymous - Alchemist Melody Circus - Alchemist Heartbreakers - Heart Kali 47 - Cult Snake Eyes - Orakel Air Balloon - Orakel (Protos should be listened to in order...

Thunderclout wraps up the album with epic chord progressions, lots of chiptune goodness and a drop that blows your face off (no pun intended). Definitely one of the highlights of Vario for me!  Next song of the week: Cloud Rider"
Savant,39uoh5,JonnyGG,3,Mon Jun 15 10:17:46 2015 UTC,"Super-glad I got my suggestion as SOTW :) .  This track was the first Savant track I heard, and frankly it blew me away at the time (and by God, does it continue to do so). Every part of this song is just plain awesome: the chip, the chainsaw-like bass, the catchy rhythms with the drums, the chord progression, and the depth and complexity make this track a clear classic in my eyes. On top of that, Thunderclout ends Vario with a bang -- it's my favourite ending to any of Aleks' albums, and it's a really stylish send-off.  Next SOTW: Stargate."
Savant,39uoh5,Toblabob,2,Mon Jun 15 20:01:27 2015 UTC,i could never get into this song now as i listen to it properly i realise how nice sounding it is all the background sounds really add to the atmosphere of the song  next sotw : crusade
Savant,39uoh5,monsteralpaca,2,Mon Jun 15 22:23:15 2015 UTC,This was the first song I considered a favourite. The melodies are really unique but at the same time sound obvious to me. It's incredible.  Next song: breakdown

Savant,398v4d,super_sheriff,3,Wed Jun 10 02:26:59 2015 UTC,Nothing more really. He's working on a Blanco EP.
Savant,398v4d,Felinski,2,Wed Jun 10 12:02:12 2015 UTC,Hes released like 1 or 2 videos of short snippets of songs. But like /u/Felinski said its mainly been silent because of the Blanco EP.
Savant,398sn8,Bugogy,3,Wed Jun 10 02:07:18 2015 UTC,"VIH did a lot of remixes and sampling, so this isn't surprising"
Savant,398sn8,BingBadaIpod,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:20:18 2015 UTC,Oh my god those costumes are amazing. Can't help but feel there was more freedom for quirky imaginative bombast in the 70's.
Savant,3960mu,Prutzle,5,Tue Jun 9 14:39:07 2015 UTC,Lack of brain capacity doesn't go with liking Savant...
Savant,3960mu,Fak3Cake,3,Tue Jun 9 15:39:36 2015 UTC,"I'm surprisingly picky with my music, despite the variety Savant offers"
Savant,3960mu,ROBOTunderscore,3,Tue Jun 9 17:56:10 2015 UTC,"I mean. Savant is a lot of things. We makes EDM, but so many songs are not dubstep. He makes Drum and Bass, house, and some vocal oriented songs too"
Savant,3960mu,BucktoothedMC,3,Tue Jun 9 15:43:21 2015 UTC,"I love his vocals. And you're right, but I still think anything that even remotely reeks of EDM scares a lot of people off."
Savant,3960mu,ROBOTunderscore,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:17:09 2015 UTC,Arent Drum and Bass and House forms of EDM?

Savant,3960mu,ThoughtfullyReckless,2,Tue Jun 9 23:24:25 2015 UTC,Ditto ^ :)
Savant,3960mu,Carpetfreak,4,Wed Jun 10 16:59:03 2015 UTC,"As for me, people think it's weird because: - I'm a Christian (and clearly we can't like anything other than Christian music... yeah...) - I'm a woman (There, I've said it) - I often seem shy - I like some Christian music (yes, you CAN like both) - I play the harp (and that means you're only allowed to like harp music) - I don't go out drinking"
Savant,3960mu,Carpetfreak,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:40:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a woman (There, I've said it)   Not to be rude, but that's not really something you need to ""confess""...and how is it weird for you to like Savant just because you're a woman? If you go to any one of his shows there'll be a pretty even gender distribution in the crowd."
Savant,3960mu,monsteralpaca,1 point,Tue Jun 9 20:40:04 2015 UTC,"That's awesome! I've not been to any of his shows... In general I always get the feeling that it's accepted (by most people) that guys like certain kinds of music, while it's (here) seen as weird if girls like it. That's why I've added that fact to my list..."
Savant,3960mu,Nezzatic,2,Wed Jun 10 06:10:44 2015 UTC,"Nah, electronic music (and especially Savant) tends to be pretty gender-inclusive."
Savant,3960mu,Gravitronus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 10:02:58 2015 UTC,Cool :)
Savant,3960mu,Gravitronus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:15:14 2015 UTC,im the same as you but i dont play harp and dont like christian music
Savant,3960mu,drekislove,0,Tue Jun 9 15:11:18 2015 UTC,How does being Christian not go with liking a genre of music. How does gender have anything to do with liking music. How does shyness relate to musical preference. How does playing an instrument relate to musical preference. How is savant related to going out drinking.   Musical preference can be affected by these factors but its completely unrelated.
Savant,3960mu,SlimSt,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:57:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. But that's what people think. I think I should've made the title clearer, people are surprised the find out I like Savant because of these other, unrelated, facts about me."
Savant,3960mu,Brayconn,0,Wed Jun 10 06:08:35 2015 UTC,"I'm a woman (There, I've said it)   So what? Did you come here to fish for attention?"
Savant,3960mu,Gravitronus,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:09:16 2015 UTC,"Nah, I'm happily married tyvm, but as I've already explained, where I live it's often (still) seen as weird if women like certain types of music, because it's not considered girly."

Savant,392pov,Carpetfreak,3,Mon Jun 8 20:44:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not super into this track, to be honest, but I will say that it works quite well as a percussion piece. As a drummer myself, I appreciate the drums section getting a bit of attention from Aleks in this track -- I'm a fan of the use of sampling as elements in it (especially the submarine sonar noise), and the rhythm has a pretty nice level of depth to it. The actual kit rhythm is a nice, catchy one, too. Also, there's a Star Wars sample; what's not to love about that?  Next SOTW: Thunderclout."

Savant,38mxnv,poprocks_and_coke,2,Fri Jun 5 08:17:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that is pretty sweet! Rise up is one of my favorite Savant tracks, too.  I hear new stuff quite often on subsequent listens of Aleks's music. The depth of his creations is generally top notch."

So he immediately dropped new stuff with obnoxious overplayed samples in an intro mix on everyone. So that we wouldn't quite know what we were hearing but whoever is close enough would get a kick out of it. It sounds a lot like blanco. Thoughts?

Savant,374lme,TheWhiteLatino69,3,Mon May 25 01:34:32 2015 UTC,I'd say either ISM or Invasion. Those are the two albums that can listen to all the way through and love every single song. They truly are masterpieces in my eyes
Savant,374lme,fuck-nexus,3,Sun May 24 21:00:17 2015 UTC,"Don't ask that! it's impossible to answer!  However, I think I must say Alchemist. I can listen to every song on that album, and I listened to it a lot, since it was released a month or so after I started to get into his music. I would say ISM since it contains the really shiny diamonds of savant's discography but I feel like that album isn't really mastered to perfection. And that is what I love about Zion. Every sound on that album is just so perfect! Perfect builds, drops, patterns, on most tracks. But then again, Melodies and feels aren't always there. And I always skip Meshugga and the latter half of Apocalypse.   But Alchemist is the love child of these two albums. The perfect mix. Every album has their own special first in one or two categories but Alchemist is the over-all winner. And considering I love every track even though it's long as hell, I find it very impressive. Even rare.  EDIT: Heart would be somewhere in the top if it wasn't so damn short."
Savant,374lme,Prutzle,3,Sun May 24 22:18:51 2015 UTC,Ism and Protos for me. Couldn't choose between the two.
Savant,374lme,Toblabob,3,Mon May 25 07:53:22 2015 UTC,"Vario is the most consistently good in my opinion, and that's why I'd say it's his best album overall. However, Zion is a brilliant album -- the songs themselves just don't hold up quite as well when compared to Vario. Same goes for Orakel; the concepts of the tracks are fantastic and the album flows wonderfully, but the songs don't quite hold up as well on their own for me.  ISM, on the other hand, is pretty much the opposite: every song is great, but they all get a bit same-y throughout the album (with the exception of Starfish and Ism, which are quite possibly my favourite songs Aleks has made). Protos is a marvellous change from the norm and I like how some of the songs from ISM were redone in a more accessible format (Cry For Love is probably my least-favourite track from ISM but one of my favourites from Protos, for example).  Alchemist is glorious, but not all the tracks stand out as much to me as those from Vario. It's also a really long album, and a hard one to listen to in one go. I'll admit: I've never listened to the whole of Overworld, Cult or Alchemist, although Overworld is full of seriously stylish tracks (Flashbach, Overworld and Eggs spring to mind) which break the mould drastically.  Cult isn't my thing at all, to be honest, apart from Kali 47 and Stereophobia. Invasion was my favourite for a while, but the album lacks continuity and an overall theme, which every other album has in spades, and an awful lot of the songs don't live up to their full potential (just my two cents, though).  Vario is my favourite because it flows, it has good tracks when they're on their own, and it has a strong theme and style which remains prevalent throughout. Zion, ISM and Orakel are all close to the top spot too.  TL;DR: Vario."
