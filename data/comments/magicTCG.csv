I think the big reason is the removal of various green recursion spells, most notably [[Devastating Dreams]]. I'm sure part of the reason for this is because people are more inclined to take storm cards when they shouldn't as opposed to other cards (I have a much easier time wheeling premier GR stompy cards, like BBE and Domri, than I do even just role-players in storm), but other archetypes, like artifacts and green ramp, can usually survive that effect, whereas Storm cannot."

Wizards can't seem to understand that, and instead of paying too much for an inferior product, people would rather just pay nothing for an even worse one.   The inverse of this is the reason Netflix is so popular. They understood that digital products are inherently worth less than physical, and their pricing reflected that."

If prices were reduced, and, well, everything else about the the experience was improved, I would love to pay to play online in an official setting. I dropped a few hundred to bots in MTGO when I first got back into playing, and haven't touched it in about 10 months because the the overall experience was just awful.

Fair systems with good value can increase your revenue and slash piracy; I spend more on music than I ever did before Spotify, for example, because it's a good product that provides what I want at a fair price.  MTGO has a lot of the problems that early music and video apps had, plus a lot more. The cost of entry is inexplicably high, and building a deck to play a friend in another state is difficult and expensive, especially if it's a copy of a paper deck. MTGO is treating online play as a parallel ecosystem, and it needs its own rules if it's going to be truly successful.  Sure, it looks fine in player count, but only the tiniest percentage of paper magic players ever touch it. That's a huge, huge indictment of the software business model, and while piracy is obviously wrong, the easiest way to reduce it is to find a business model that renders piracy obsolete. WOTC hasn't even TRIED to do that, which is really weird. Fixing MTGO is low-hanging fruit."
magicTCG,3e1222,msdrahcir,3,Tue Jul 21 14:10:46 2015 UTC,"Because I'm not going to get scammed by somebody selling me a cockatrice card on ebay?  Cockatrice is like proxies, not counterfeits. Everybody knows that they aren't real cards."
magicTCG,3e1222,UninterestinUsername,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:56 2015 UTC,"I think there is a huge difference between counterfeit cards and cockatrice. Cockatrice is something that I see as a net positive for the community. I use Cockatrice to test decks before I acquire cards and occasionally to draft but if anything Cockatrice keeps me excited about the game, buying product and playing more in real life. If MODO wasn't such a huge money suck, an overall negative social experience and generally tedious (ppl double queuing etc) then I might use it more instead, but I actually still use both products for the things that make sense. I cant test decks on MODO the way I can on trice.   Counterfeiting and to a large extend stealing art are actively bad for Wizards and MTG. Art stealing erodes the brand, means the artists dont get due credit etc.  Counterfeiting screws people out of money,  erodes trust in the value of cards etc.   Cockatrice may cause there to be a loss of sales on MODO and that is a valid argument against it but its hard for me to have an idea of what the impact is.   On my personal experience trice is a net positive for the community and wizards the other activities are not."
magicTCG,3e1222,pok3_smot,2,Tue Jul 21 16:29:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't get it either.   You'd think people would be cool with counterfeits as well, but it's probably because they actually feel like their cards are theirs and they have value for them, and that counterfeits actually personally affect them....  What they don't realize is their cards are actually worthless unless people are playing magic."

magicTCG,3e1222,QuackerMTG,62,Tue Jul 21 15:09:53 2015 UTC,"My main problem with the latest changes is the doubling the cost of DEs. Like why? There is not really a single legitimate reason for doubling their cost other than as a cash-grab. Why couldn't they just convert the existing 6 ticket entry, 11/6 pack payout into equivalent play points? 6 ticket entry, 6 packs + 200 play points for 4-0, 3 packs + 120 play points for 3-1. Easy and done. Maybe even decrease the play points a little if you must so that you're not using pack MSRP. People did not have a problem with the DE prize structure itself, it was just the packs being worth so little.   It seems Wizards decided that since they're making some changes anyway, it'd be a perfect time to just increase their own rake and make it less profitable for players for no reason other than because they can. Especially ironic given that we're largely in this predicament of needing a fix for low pack prices in the first place because of the last time Wizards decided they needed a bigger rake and increased the redemption fee for no reason."
magicTCG,3e1222,ArmadilloAl,36,Tue Jul 21 07:38:01 2015 UTC,"and increased the redemption fee for no reason.   Yeah i used to spend 200~$ a month online drafting and building complerte sets.  Id do 4x normal 1x foil and redeem them, but now its 125$+ shiuping + cards whereas before it was 25$+shipping + cards.  Absurd and i wont pay it. So now i just dick around with casual jank if i even login."
magicTCG,3e1222,Swekyde,10,Tue Jul 21 09:36:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty clear that someone in the financial department decided that the MTGO redemption fee was an area that wasn't being monetized, which was a crime against the corporate profit margin.  If it was actually card and shipping costs that increased as they claim, I could see the cost increasing a couple dollars, or even doubling to $10, but not increasing five times over its original cost."
magicTCG,3e1222,guitarguru01,9,Tue Jul 21 13:24:55 2015 UTC,Is it really $125 + shipping to redeem a set now?   How is this going to affect the secondary market?

magicTCG,3e1222,GNG,26,Tue Jul 21 16:23:29 2015 UTC,"I started playing MTGO when it came out in like 2001 or whatever. The problem is that MTGO has been in a generally crappy state so long, that no one (including WOTC) realizes what it could be.  What Hearthstone did was prove that the appetite is out there for competitive online CG's. And it's huge.    Now, I'm not saying they can or should copy HS, but WoTC has everything it could want to compete alongside it, namely the game/history of MtG itself.    Where HS production values promote the physicality and effects of the cards, MTGO can push sleekness, simplicity, and cleanness.  More importantly, where HS promotes it's casual-friendly nature, MTGO can promote it's strategic and competitive depth.   If MTGO was truly re-imagined from the ground up, (think complete redesign, new customizations, community tools, cross-platform, etc.) I truly believe it could challenge the top online games in popularity."
magicTCG,3e1222,lupiinoctourne,3,Tue Jul 21 12:04:42 2015 UTC,If MTGO was truly re-imagined from the ground up   Problem is they don't have enough people to do that -- they're all too busy trying to make the next set release deadline.  And they point-blank refuse to invest more $$ into into getting enough (quality) people to do anything meaningful in terms of improving the MTGO experience. In the meantime the people who are there slave away making the current client worse and worse with more and more spaghetti code. I honeestly wouldn't be surprised if some set comes around where they just can't make the deadline and the set doesn't release on time. I'd laugh so hard. And then I'd cry.
magicTCG,3e1222,TehCheator,26,Tue Jul 21 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"I was initially skeptical that the client was as bad as people said it was.  Now that I've been playing on MTGO for a while I unfortunately have to agree with them.  In addition to performance issues there are a large number of usability problems.  Another thing that I don't ever really see mentioned is that you can't type in some languages that aren't English.  This is a huge issue in terms of growing the international user base.  It really seems like wizards has no interest in growing parts of their international user base given the abysmally inconvenient Daily Event starting times and the fact that if you don't type your language using the Roman alphabet you are basically screwed.  Can you imagine telling someone ""Hey, try out our online game client.  You can't communicate with your friends and all the event start times are when you are working or sleeping.""  This is not even an issue of the large effort that would be required for full localization (cards + menus etc in foreign languages).  A separate (albeit not insignificant) effort could conceivably be made to enable this kind of chat support.  I don't know how the system is designed but there is a very good chance that something like that would lay groundwork for actual localization down the line.  In terms of the cost.... given how inconvenient Daily Events were for me to begin with you can imagine that I am not particularly happy that they now cost twice as much.  Lastly, since I'm complaining about MTGO let me ask why the card sorting for the various deck view windows is still broken?  This behavior was actually modified with the last update (from broken functionality to another, different broken functionality)."
magicTCG,3e1222,NarcolepticLlama,22,Tue Jul 21 08:19:44 2015 UTC,"you would have been much happier considering the vastly reduced cost involved in a digital product   You're making some extra-large assumptions here, that I think need to be more carefully considered.  First assumption: WotC would prefer if you played online instead of in paper. Did you consider whether the paper game is important to the health of the online version? Wizards has made no bones about the fact that the FLGS is a core part of its survival strategy. All else equal, I'd imagine that Wizards has a very strong preference for you to be playing where you're visible to (and interacting with) other people, such that you influence one-another to keep playing magic. Unless you'e something like a top-25 streamer, you're probably more valuable to them playing paper before costs are taken into account.  Second assumption: The cost of the digital product is much lower than the paper product. Are you sure about that? All of the costs involved in making the cards, art, rules, translations, etc., are one-and-done. It's done once for both digital and paper, so to say that one incurs more of those costs than the other is fallacious. After that, what's left over in paper is basically printing, packaging, and shipping. Good logistics aren't cheap, but Wizards goes through wholesalers, rather than integrating its entire supply chain, so the area they're dealing with scales very well. By contrast, you haven't even started programming the digital version. Sure, the marginal cost of a booster pack online is incredibly low, but what's the cost of getting it there, on a per-set basis?  tl;dr: I think you'd be surprised if you compared the actual cost to Wizards of MTGO to your value as a customer playing paper."
magicTCG,3e1222,AndrewWaldron,9,Tue Jul 21 12:44:13 2015 UTC,"The only thing I want to counter is your response to the second assumption: Once the digital product is created, it literally is one-and-done. Once it is on the system, after design and coding has completed, the only further cost ensued on the part of WotC is server bandwidth and memory use. They could re-release innistrad tomorrow on MTGO and it would not cost them a large amount compared to physically printing that product. Yes they go through wholesalers;but you dodge ink costs, the cost of running the printers, the cost of paper, the cost of packaging material, the cost of shipping it to the warehouse, etc.   Let me put it in a different way: You have a digital game and a physical board game. Let's say you had a typo on some side material a part of the game (say a random chance card.) and you feel that you need it corrected and need to get the fixed element to every person that owns the game. (Yes i know its not too logical for physical board games but run with me)  The digital game requires a coder/designer/someone to fix it. If it needs to be redesigned, it gets redesigned. The physical board game, the same thing. Probably to get the element fixed it takes both games the same time. However, here is where there is difference, distribution.  The digital game preps a patch, pays $500 to their platform and sends out the fix to all 10k players at once, to be fixed at their leisure.  The physical game preps 10k letters, pays $5000 to a mail distributor and sends out the fix to Hopefully all 10k players, to be recieved through the mail system that could loose their letter.  Correlation to Magic and MTGO? The cost and the process. To create a new product for WotC costs the same about across the board, if not cheaper on digital. The separate teams prep both products for launch. But digital is instantaneous and can be done at a fraction of the cost, especially if its on their product. Physical products take coordination, quality control, and a lot of costs through the production and the shipping.  So in conclusion, yes the creation of the game itself is about the same, but the other elements involved around the type of products creates the variable canyon in the difference of production prices. And while it may incur a lot of costs in digital at the beginning, they have the power to repopulate the product at the click of a button and make more money."
magicTCG,3e1222,Midguy,2,Tue Jul 21 13:28:38 2015 UTC,"In addition to the point you made, there's some serious cognitive dissonance in saying that the digital product has significantly lower costs while at the same time complaining about the look of the UI and bugs in the game. How do people think those things get changed? Good Programmers and Graphic Designers aren't cheap.  I'm not saying WotC isn't making plenty of mistakes (by all accounts they are a bad software shop to work at and aren't able to recruit the top talent). It just seems crazy to me to say in one breath that I want discounted prices because there isn't any cost associated with the digital packs and then in the next breath complain about things that take time and money to fix, as if those somehow aren't significant costs."
magicTCG,3e1222,stumpyraccoon,7,Tue Jul 21 14:27:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the problem is wizards isn't doing either.... if they hired real employees, I wouldn't mind the non-discounted product.

magicTCG,3e1222,22bebo,6,Tue Jul 21 15:58:26 2015 UTC,"Jacking up prices on MTGO and pissing off the community, can't get the PC version of Origins released, do they HAVE an IT Director?      I've recently come back to MTG and while MTGO is easy and convenient I didn't think it was all that economical to begin with.  Add in the clunkiness of the interface and overall performance I don't see a reason to invest any more in their digital product, certainly not with Origins eventually releasing and letting me play basically for free that way (on top of all the other ways to play electronically as well).      I'm sure WotC is looking through these threads (at least if they're smart) and just want them to know the views of a long time, returning player on their digital product."

I quit magic online around the time that they were beta testing the new client (which I thought was horrible) but before they forced it on everyone.  When I came back a couple of months ago, I was actually pleasantly surprised at how much better the client was.  Of course a game like hearthstone has a prettier UI and all that, but its a simple game that allows for them to have such.  Hearthstone doesn't provide nearly as much depth and Magic is a game that has proven to withstand the test of time."

Honestly, I'd be extremely interested in seeing age data on those who rant about MTGO and those who just quietly enjoy it.

Do you want to get better at Magic by playing high-level Magic against good opponents frequently?  Then you want MTGO.  There's no substitute.  And that won't change.  Free alternatives don't have the Darwinian selection because they're free.  People play whatever, because nothing is on the line.  Opponents get salty and drop.  Nothing matters.  That doesn't foster good play and skill.  If you're good on MTGO, you'll pair with someone with an equivalent record each round.  Cockatrice and xMage don't do that.  And most importantly, if I'm a better player and I can play on xMage for free and win nothing, or MTGO and go infinite (making it free) plus win prizes, why would I choose XMage?  The pretty UI?  I agree with your criticisms.  The thing is that you're ignoring the upside.  And that upside creates a monopoly for Wizards.  Even though alternatives exist, for a huge portion of the Magic playing community, they don't matter, never will matter, and in fact - can't matter (structurally!).  The benefits of being an official product outweigh the warts for folks who care about playing high-level Magic and lots of it.  The problem is that that doesn't create a lot of incentive for Wizards to make things better."
magicTCG,3e1222,pyromosh,13,Tue Jul 21 03:37:18 2015 UTC,"The problem is that that doesn't create a lot of incentive for Wizards to make things better.   That is something i never really understand to some degree from the viewpoint of the company.  Having the monopol status doesn't change the fact that some investments can result in even greater revenue. It is even more likely if you have a monopol status, because your product is very likely good ( in this case the game, not modo) and it has a bigger ""draw"" then some random product.  Or to say it more simple: because they have the monopol status can could make SO much more money if they just improve modo. It doesnt seem to require really big investments, because some points like ""There are graphics designers still in school who make more attractive products than MTGO."" are true and well... cannot be that costly to heir some kids?! xD  Is there any bigger incentive to make money for a company? I would like to think ""no"", but for some reason that doesnt seem to be the case or wotc is just really bad with their investmentmanagment."
magicTCG,3e1222,rerek,7,Tue Jul 21 07:10:03 2015 UTC,"You have it backwards - they have monopoly status, so the money is guaranteed. They don't have to spend anything more than strictly necessary, and they'll keep getting new players, because they have a monopoly.

How does that not piss you off? You pay actual money that you did a full-ass job to earn for a half-assed product from a company that could care less about your needs as a customer. It's like paying $60 for a tetris port to modern consoles, no new graphics, no features of any kind, just blatantly taking advantage of anyone financially inept enough to pay for it. Never mind that we've already created a demand that far exceeds the cost of ink and card as players, now we are expected to create that same demand for something even more insubstantial, and Wizards can't even be bothered to provide us an attractive and functional medium by which to purchase the finest actual nothing money can buy?

magicTCG,3e1222,sebbyk,4,Tue Jul 21 15:14:33 2015 UTC,Honestly?  I think you should be right.  But Wizards seems to think the best approach is by forking the market and throwing the Duels series to casuals.

MTGO is a substitute, something you do if you can't make it to paper tournaments. You know that infamous quote about how they ""don't see Hearthstone as a competitor""? That's because there's no paper Hearthstone. Hearthstone can HAVE the digital market. Magic is a trading card game, not a video game. I know a lot of pros and high level players wish it was a video game, but it is a game with trading cards that you have to go to the comic book shop and risk being labeled a NERD to play.

magicTCG,3e1222,notaballoon,25,Tue Jul 21 06:05:25 2015 UTC,"I agree that MTGO should change as quickly as possible, not for the worse like recently but to a better version of itself; a compleat version of itself.  But if too many people just outright stop using MTGO then Hasbro will do the most logical thing for a company like Hasbro to do: Stop funding a product which doesn't generate enough revenue. (Which means that MTGO would basically die, forever. Officially.)  Now i know most people (as in: most MTGO players) don't want that. But neither do they want to deal with the mess that has been the current client and management of MTGO (Not that it was much different from previous versions). It's a very complex situation where the consumer is kind of pushing himself between two bad situations or choices expecting them to miraculously turn into good ones.  We know WotC never was really into digital media, we know that the whole team around Worth is actually very small and not exactly up to the task or in possession of all the required abilities and skills. But as /u/notaballoon mentioned it doesn't seem like WotC intended MTGO to be a video game, at all; that's why they did the Duels series i assume.  I'm not sure how much the MTGO team actually can decide on what they may or may not do with the MTGO Client, it could be that they just receive a note form higher ups with a static demand which has absolutely no concern of how they achieve it or even if it is achievable at all.   Even the games they outsourced haven't been that good. The UI may look nice but then notice that it is a simplified version with a restricted pool of cards which doesn't expand on a regular basis and so on...   I'm not a friend of the recent changes to the event structure. Not.one.bit. But, it is conflicting that the payout is still not up to par while the prices increase to even just play at all. This means that people will simply play less if at all and WotC or Hasbro will just be like ""Why are you playing less now? We give you more rewards and player points now, yet you're still not happy?""  I mean what i gather from what i read here and other places most people expect the following from MTGO currently or a very close future:   A proper UI which doesn't feel 10 years old right out of the box. A proper dev team which addresses known and future client issues and prevents some horrendous bugs and frustrations experienced by players. A proper business model which benefits both sides. People tend to forget that development and maintenance of any kind of program like this will cost time and money on a regular basis and that the company making that program has to make enough benefit to continue investing in it. That MTGO becomes a real alternative to paper MTG and not just it's digital step brother you play with when Paper Mtg isn't there to entertain you.   The goals are neither unachievable not unrealistic but certainly not easy to reach.  sorry for all the text :("
magicTCG,3e1222,Badfiend,8,Tue Jul 21 07:09:54 2015 UTC,"You know, I think the lack of ownership and lack of hope for an improved MTGO is what keeps many, like myself, away. I don't want to sink hundreds of dollars into something that could be dropped by Hasbro and lose everything.   If MTGO dies, are they going to send everyone paper copies of thier digital cards? I seriously doubt it.   Edit: spelling. WTF is a Hasbrouck and why does Hasbro autocorrect to it?"
magicTCG,3e1222,0Asterite0,7,Tue Jul 21 09:10:41 2015 UTC,"The thing is that WotC views MTGO as ""gravy"". The reason everything is so low rent is because they don't want to devote resources to it, because they aren't serious about it. They'll stop funding it if it becomes unprofitable, but neither will they bend over backwards to make sure their grinders have a way to avoid paper Magic: they'd rather have you in the card shops anyway."
magicTCG,3e1222,Knight_of_Tumblr,14,Tue Jul 21 07:14:22 2015 UTC,"And I'd rather BE in a card shop, but when the nearest one involves a half hour walk to a train, an hours train ride and then another half hour walk, that's not going to happen on a frequent basis. Add to that the fact I have two 2 year olds at home, and it just becomes even more unreasonable.   I only recently started playing MTGO, but it's the only way I can play frequently, so I'm happy to spend money on it. Im certain there are lots of people in similar situations, and it just seems bizarre that they're not capitalizing on that as much as possible."
magicTCG,3e1222,ShockwaveMTME,8,Tue Jul 21 07:59:00 2015 UTC,"Because you're in the minority. And the overhead for exploiting your demographic vs. how much they can actually squeeze out of you makes it not worth it. Just like it's not worth it to build a train station in front of everyone's house, it isn't worth it to take on a bunch of expense so the relatively small percentage of your players who can't make it to a store will have the opportunity to spend money on your online incarnation. People act like any person who doesn't play MODO is just money on the table, but how many people--really--do you think don't play MODO who would if the interface was nicer? I mean, obviously more than 0, but given that there's actually a lot of additional infrastructure to this kind of thing, I'd wager that Wizards doesn't think it's worth it. There's a reason than pizza places have a range for their deliveries, and that's the same reason Wizards has a cap on how much they're willing to spend on MODO."
magicTCG,3e1222,Aethien,2,Tue Jul 21 08:08:15 2015 UTC,Pretty much every magic player I've ever met who doesn't use MODO does so specifically because the product is crap. Wizards is run by foolish individuals indeed if they truly believe a product known to be sub-par is an acceptable solution to any issue. Where's the logic here? Do they think people will stop going to stores if MTGO isn't terrible? That's ridiculous on a number of levels.  The simple fact is that Wizards has taken a position here that is indefensible.
magicTCG,3e1222,Deathspiral222,4,Tue Jul 21 15:52:02 2015 UTC,Why would you want to play with sweaty smelly nerds in a confined space for 3+ hours?

magicTCG,3e1222,ShockwaveMTME,4,Tue Jul 21 13:29:17 2015 UTC,i agree that's why i also mentioned it ( not in your words though)    That MTGO becomes a real alternative to paper MTG and not just it's digital step brother you play with when Paper Mtg isn't there to entertain you.
magicTCG,3e1222,the_alberta_way,4,Tue Jul 21 07:18:34 2015 UTC,"A proper dev team which addresses known and future client issues and prevents some horrendous bugs and frustrations experienced by players.   WotC hires and pays people as if they're a dream workplace. Something they are for many on the paper side of things but this practice falls apart in a big way when it comes to developers because on the digital side they're not the biggest fish in a tiny pond, they're a tiny fish in an ocean full of better options (like Blizzard, google, amazon, academics or you name it) and until WotC adjusts and start paying much higher wages and starts to foster an environment where talented developers want to work MTGO is going to suffer for it."

magicTCG,3e1222,Luvik,7,Tue Jul 21 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"Exactly right, WotC don't want to undo the hard work they've done in setting up a strong paper market by simply encouraging people to play it as a video game. Remember that there are many bricks and mortar shops out there that operate almost entirely off MtG card sales.  Just because WotC could turn MtG into a successful digital product doesn't mean they should.  You could make the same argument about board game developers - sure, they could just turn all their games into digital products (many of them are easier to play this way, even) but that doesn't mean they want to, nor should they."
magicTCG,3e1222,ToThePint,2,Tue Jul 21 09:44:25 2015 UTC,"There is a large difference between most board games and a card game.  Have online poker games demised the casino?  Take a look into a casino, a LOT of the games are now digital versions.  Online poker is huge, but has not done anything but strengthen the game, because the more people that play the game, the better.  People will always prefer the tactile experience of playing games with physical pieces, amongst friends.  But if they want this game to grow and thrive, they defiantly should put a lot more effort into the digital product.  The more people that play, the better, it's that simple.  People will play something, hearthstone etc.  It's far better for WoTC, if they play magic."

magicTCG,3e1222,SP4C3MONK3Y,6,Tue Jul 21 14:21:47 2015 UTC,"This is the answer right here. WotC is terrified (and quite frankly rightfully so) of cannibalizing the paper market and destroying much of the work in terms of building up the LGS modem that they've spent absurds amount of time, energy and money doing over the last few years.   So the core rule for MTGO, is that from an economics standpoint, it cannot be more advantageous for someone to play on-line rather than off-line, which is why the two systems pretty much have been kept on par in terms of pricing."
magicTCG,3e1222,Jackels,3,Tue Jul 21 12:43:08 2015 UTC,"My issue is that I will always prefer physically drafting the cards. But I can't just walk into my LGS at 2PM on a Tuesday and say, ""OK time to draft!"". Drafts are only available Friday at 6PM. If I want to draft at any other time, MTGO is my only option. MTGO will never compete with physical MTG (for me), but the convenience factor makes it my only option most of the time."

Instead, they could maybe provide those of us who want a good online TCG something that's not an atrocious pile of shit."

I can't say I necessarily disagree, but WotC are never gonna go that direction.  Blizzard make so much money they can afford to make their game ""free-to-play"", WotC cannot afford this.  MTGO is crazy profitable using their current model.  Unless these changes drastically reduce the amount of people playing in DEs (hint, it won't.  grinders gonna grind) then WotC will continue down this path of making MTGO more and more expensive."

For years I have painstakingly tried to promote MTGO to my youtube community and recruit as many players to it regardless of the obvious flaws. I have always been an social online gamer. I have always been drawn to games that have clans, teams or guilds that help interact with others.  To this day, clans are still 100% useless. We aren't able to host private tournaments, nor is there a function for observers in private games to see both players hands, options that would make the software a lot easier and appealing to viewers of streams and youtube.     I desperately want WotC to get their act together. MTGO could be a phenomenal gaming experience that could draw huge crowds like Hearthstone does.   This latest change is the step in the wrong direction. The ""tax"" or ""rake"" on the events is completely unreasonable. Most games these days actually do the opposite, by REWARDING play. League of Legends, Dota, Hearthstone, actually incentivize playing with earning various point systems that can be used to buy in game purchases. How these games make money is by people choosing to spend money rather than grind the points, and they have been MORE than successful ideologies.   Can you imagine how many people would queue up in the 2, 8, and daily Queues if they were free? I know WotC is worried about collaborations between players scooping games to grind points, but their is an EASY solution to this, by suspending or outright banning offenders. Yes, this would require a lot of work to perfect, and it seems that that is what WotC is most afraid of, actually putting in the work required."

I was always a bit hesitant pay for your product (MTGO) because essentially I'm paying for the same product two times since I own already own most of the products in paper.   There is a great opportunity for Wizards to have a link between paper and digital cards. However, they cannot and should not start that process until MTGO is at an optimal state.   ...vastly reduced cost involved in a digital product...   Although we do not know the exact digital production costs of MTGO saying that it is ""vastly reduced"" compared to the paper product is naive. Just some of tasks you may not be considering: programming and releasing 4+ expansions a year, card design and development, server upkeep, and customer support. The thousandth pack may cost nothing but the 1st pack costs thousands.   Your UI is still terrible after years of development. There is no excuse for this. There are graphics designers still in school who make more attractive products than MTGO.   In my opinion flashy graphics is not what MTGO needs. It's a highly completive and strategic game and shouldn't be bogged down by a Hearthstone-like interface. It's good to keep in mind that MTG wasn't designed to be a video game.   You still have cards which crash your client.   There will always be bugs in every software program because costs rise exponentially as you approach a perfect release. However, once identified turn-around on fixing the bugs needs to be quick and they have only recently become transparent about this process.   Discounted prices aside, you're still increasing the cost to even play the game. The prize structure was always a bit top heavy but you've demonstrated in your last update to the pay structure and this introduction of ""play points"" that you're not interested in fixing this in any capacity. This makes no sense; you have a digital product.   I think we need to spend some time considering why they made this choice and see how its implemented before we can make your conclusion.   ...creating a discounted form of MTG that competitive players would want to practice on, and new players could get introduced to easier...   MTGO is not for ""new players"". Duels of Planeswalkers fills this roll and has the flashy graphics you were looking for earlier. I would also argue that MTGO is a discount form. Consider the price difference between digital and paper cards for DTK"
magicTCG,3e1222,Xelnastoss,2,Tue Jul 21 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind, ""flashy graphics"" is not what this is about.   Similar to any professional product, virtual or not, the facade has to be updated to keep it looking new and relevant to the current times.  In a virtual product, that means their UI. It's the same reason OSX and Windows update their UI despite it's functionality. People don't like looking at outdated/ugly things. Their UI is a serious issue that hurts customer satisfaction."
magicTCG,3e1222,Gamecubeboy,2,Tue Jul 21 14:24:28 2015 UTC,"You're right, graphics and UI are separate issues. I'm concerned that players are confusing poor UI design with the difficulty of implementing MTG rules into a digital product. With such a complex game the UI needs to be as simple and intuitive as it can be. It's not there yet, but moving towards Hearthstone would be going in the wrong direction."
magicTCG,3e1222,placebotwo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:48 2015 UTC,"I think your points are spot on for the most part. However the discounted prices of MTGO is not due to anything WOTC related, that's just the player economy in action.   I honestly think that if the boosters were half the price of paper version they would attract more customers. New players would have a place to transition from DOTP into a real deck, giving them enough confidence to attend FNM. It would also be a place where experienced players could buy multiple decks to test out ideas for the metagame at their PTQ. ATM MTGO does none of these, and fails on many other levels."

However the discounted prices of MTGO is not due to anything WOTC related, that's just the player economy in action.   I agree with you that the player economy has a greater impact on card prices, but don't forget about set redemption. Wizards can limit the number of redemptions and adjust the redemption fee which has a direct impact on card prices.   I honestly think that if the boosters were half the price of paper version they would attract more customers.   $2 booster is an interesting concept but you would have to prove that they would at least double the number of packs purchased. Otherwise, it's just not right move for their business.    New players would have a place to transition from DOTP into a real deck, giving them enough confidence to attend FNM. It would also be a place where experienced players could buy multiple decks to test out ideas for the metagame at their PTQ. ATM MTGO does none of these, and fails on many other levels.   I don't think you can say MTGO does none these things. You could say that the price isn't right for you, but all of the items you describe are possible. Finding the right price that yields the most players while meeting revenue needs is the real challenge."

If it works for Spotify why couldn't it work for MTGO. It would be great to play lots of different decks, and would probably cause me to go out and buy paper decks more than the one modern deck I own."

magicTCG,3e2u2v,fracguru,33,Tue Jul 21 15:06:35 2015 UTC,"As a result, I expect the competition in the daily events to increase substantially as the average players stop playing them and instead...  Play 8-mans. For average players, 8-mans are now where the value is at. Your EV is still negative, but very close to break even and MUCH better than current EV of 8-mans.  TLDR: new payout changes are great for pros and daily event grinders. Average players will find better results dropping to the 8-man queues.   I have a feeling this is an intentional effect of the change. I doubt WotC pulled this out of their butts a few days ago and just slapped it together. I'd be fairly certain they did at least some basic economic analysis of the change (and likely a bit more than that) before they decided to implement this."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,johnts03,26,Tue Jul 21 15:35:16 2015 UTC,Thank you for this.  I hate how every Jimbob in this subreddit thinks that WoTC makes every decision by dropping dice into a dice tower and referencing a DM guide for the answer.  Every company wants to stay in business.  Every company is going to make decisions that allow them to grow the areas they feel are most important and cheaply maintain they consider less important.  If you think WoTC makes decisions lightly and without intense thought and consultation you're dead wrong.
magicTCG,3e2u2v,cheatonus,7,Tue Jul 21 15:48:22 2015 UTC,"Doubling the up-front price of entry seems like a fantastic way to shrink the user base.  A certain amount of players won't drop to 8-mans, they'll just drop off MTGO. A certain portion of the existing 8-man crowd will leave MTGO due to only seeing the same net decks and increased competition.   A certain portion will drop because play points don't help them earn tix to improve their deck/collection.  What part of this is good for MTGO? What part of this is good for MTGO players?"
magicTCG,3e2u2v,dougtulane,-4,Tue Jul 21 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"Because that certain percentage is not the greater percentage?  It is also not the primary player base?

magicTCG,3e2u2v,dougtulane,0,Tue Jul 21 18:24:23 2015 UTC,"Because a certain percentage (like myself) will probably increase their activity on MTGO.  Currently I only play dailies.  If I don't get home in time for the daily, I don't log on.  With this change, my surplus of play points will encourage me to play other events, whether it be because of the increased EV of 2 mans and 8 mans or simply having a surplus of play points to blow on drafts, sealed dailies and PPTQ's.  As someone who previously only felt like it was worth my time playing in constructed dailies (and has become frustrated with extremely low pack prices), I welcome the change."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,Midguy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:38:12 2015 UTC,"That's great for you, and you probably have a good win%.  Play points are not a bad idea, increasing the price of dailies is. It will decrease the number of people entering, and really punish people who brew, or play on any kind of a budget."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,dougtulane,0,Tue Jul 21 18:42:27 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but at the same time, I think that because 2 mans will offer more consistent EV and 8 mans offering better EV in general, that people with brews have other avenues to flex their competitive muscle and tune their decks."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,Midguy,2,Tue Jul 21 18:56:35 2015 UTC,"Well obviously WotC made some serious thought on this.  They probably thought the following:  2-man - slightly lower cost of payout - WIN  8-man - slightly lower cost of payout - WIN  DE - 35% lower cost of payout, give the man who came up with this idea a raise and a promotion - WIN WIN  lets rollout the new change as even though it lowers the cost to Wizards, the price of packs right now is so bad, the community wont notice this as a bad thing since it increases the EV from today's level, best opportunity ever."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,dolpherx,0,Tue Jul 21 18:10:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. Wizards just decided that since they were editing those numbers anyway, they might as well make it less profitable for players and hope people don't notice amidst all the changing numbers and different types of prizes."

magicTCG,3e2u2v,SaffronOlive,11,Tue Jul 21 17:21:59 2015 UTC,I agree.  I'm sure they did this exact analysis.  I also believe they wanted to make 8-mans more interesting while increasing the rewards for the good players in daily events.

magicTCG,3e2u2v,Ominyx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:20:21 2015 UTC,"OP uses math and bases his conclusions on it. You are trying to skew his math to assume only above average people will continue to play mtgo/daily events, which I doubt will be the case. People with janky decks, bad players, and combinations of the two will probably still want to battle it out in the DEs to see if they can hack it.  I don't have math for this comment, but if the past has told us anything, people will continue to play mtgo through just about anything - bad clients, increased redemption costs, better designed games etc.  Additionally, the increasingly competitive nature of paper tournaments hasn't stopped people from showing up, it's actually increased participation. SCG events and GPs for example, have had drastic increases in attendance even though the cost to enter has gone up, because prizes have gone up, and they've become more competitive."

Thus their win % in DEs will be 50%. I doubt it would be this bad, but it could be a significant win % drop if the EV for DEs are bad enough for average players.  And when you consider the larger cost of entry for DEs, the bad to average player will have even further reason to avoid DEs. Ultimately, even a drop of a couple percentage points for the grinders is hugely significant to their EV."

It's more likely the exact opposite, people start in 2 man queues and 8-mans, and get better little by little.

magicTCG,3e2u2v,Jerry987,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so the ultimate conclusion is that everyone should stick to the 8 mans and that the DEs are for the toughest competition for people that dont care about EV."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,jagoob,7,Tue Jul 21 18:08:28 2015 UTC,The problem with this analysis is that these pack prices aren't reflective of normal pack prices. Since origins drops tomorrow the demand for frf and dtk packs is absurdly low relative to the supply resulting in a huge glut. Absent this change when origins would have dropped packs would have been at 3.9tix for a week and then slowly dropped to stabilize around 3.2-3.5tix based on how good of a draft set origins is. At any of these pack prices this is a terrible change and kills EV.
magicTCG,3e2u2v,trny3,7,Tue Jul 21 17:34:35 2015 UTC,"To me it seems like people are too quick to jump on any change and berate wizards for it. MODO sucks. Lets get that out there to start with. But that is why we NEED changes. The previous system was broken where pack prices sunk so low because dailies and other events were vomiting them out.   Will the new change be good? maybe, nobody knows till it runs for a few months. It is too complex to predict the impact. But the fact there is CHANGE is a good thing."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,mrme355,6,Tue Jul 21 17:06:42 2015 UTC,"This is how I imagine one other category feels about the change in regards to daily events:  • You like to play magic for fun (40%-45% win percentage)  So you liked entering daily events huh scrub? Thought your blistering rage or collected company slivers was pretty fun? And you RDW seems pretty decent in standard considering it has almost no rares. Oh you like pauper because you could make a semi competitive deck for 12 tickets huh kid?   Now your pretty busy living your life so you can only really play maybe 1-2 per week and you usually get X-2. But maybe every other week you might get 3-1 and then you just have to buy a few more tickets to draft with your winnings. You spend something like 20-30 something bucks a month on modo and while you know most of that money you will never get back your ok since your having fun and going out is expensive so you can totally justify it, its kinda like you can FNM at home in your spare time!  Well Fuck you, get your scrub ass outta here here with your casual shit this fucking instant. Go install hearthstone we don't fucking care. If you wanna still do this your gunna pay double what your paying now to get the same payout you were getting before. Yup thats right double fee to get in and you still basically get 2 drafts from your occasional 3-1's. Magic is serious shit and you could just come and screw around or play ""pauper"" on the cheap and we wouldn't notice huh? Well you were dead fucking wrong about that! The jig is now officially up so pay up or get the hell outta here right meow!  *E formatting"
magicTCG,3e2u2v,trny3,3,Tue Jul 21 17:57:33 2015 UTC,This is correct.  This change pushes casuals to 8-mans queues.  Which I believe is what they want.

magicTCG,3e2u2v,Blackout28,12,Tue Jul 21 16:22:34 2015 UTC,This analysis assumes that the payout units are comparable (i.e. tickets and playpoints are equally desirable based on some ratio). I dont believe this is the case. For example in the old world I can sell packs I dont want for tickets and buy cards for decks I want to make. In the new payout world I could have infinity play points and there is no way for me to convert them to cards for my decks without spending hours playing limited events.
magicTCG,3e2u2v,Midguy,6,Tue Jul 21 16:27:45 2015 UTC,I assume that's why they included both packs and play points in the prize pool. Looking at OP's calcs at 60% win rate you can expect to make ~110 play points per daily event. Entry is 120 play points so you should not find yourself in a situation with a large amount of play points.
magicTCG,3e2u2v,Nizzahon,12,Tue Jul 21 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"You can only have 'infinite' play points with a match win rate of 62.5% or better.  This is extremely unlikely.  Even players with a match win percentage of 55% will only win 2/3 of the points to 'go infinite' on event entries.  You make an important point, but your conclusion is incorrect.  99.9% of players will have to use ALL of their play points up and supplement with tickets for event entries.  This fact will keep play points value at 10 points per ticket.  edit:  However, to get full value you must play in enough events to actually use up your play points.  This is why I think it would be helpful if they allowed you to pay for entries with a mix of tickets and play points instead of the planned either/or option."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,gereffi,3,Tue Jul 21 15:49:52 2015 UTC,"You can also draft with play points which is kind of like using play points to open packs, correct? Not ideal of course, but the play points CAN go somewhere."

I dont believe this is the case. For example in the old world I can sell packs I dont want for tickets and buy cards for decks I want to make. In the new payout world I could have infinity play points and there is no way for me to convert them to cards for my decks without spending hours playing limited events.   How do you have infinity play points without winning a single pack of cards along the way?  If you have infinity play points, every single pack that you win in your prize is 100% allocated to buying cards since you have no need for tix as an entry option."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,dolpherx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:34:07 2015 UTC,"Let's look at the instance where your win percentage is 100% and Origins packs are 3 tix.  (Easily done in the spreadsheet)  In the current setup you win 22 tickets of value in packs every tournament.  In the new payouts you only get 18 tix worth of product.  You're infinite on play points.  In the current system you have to use 6 tickets of your winnings to enter the next tournament, giving you 16 tickets to invest in your collection.  In the new system you use some of your (supposedly worthless) play points to enter the next tournament and you can use ALL 18 tickets of your pack winnings to invest in cards.   So we see that even in the extreme case of going infinite with points you are better off in the new payout.  This analysis becomes equal with an Origins value of 2.6 tix per pack.  So, yes.  If you play in just one tournament you will win some worthless play points and have more tickets to invest in your collection (~4 more).  If the idea is to go infinite and always add to the value of your collection, the new system is better at high match win percentages at all reasonable price points."

magicTCG,3e2u2v,UninterestinUsername,4,Tue Jul 21 16:19:47 2015 UTC,"My problem with your post is this:   If you use 2.34 tix for DTK and 1.41 tix for FRF (current data from MTGGoldfish.com), here is the breakdown for the different player types:   If you're comparing the new system to exactly what we have today, it's better. But you have to understand that today's system EV is terrible for the players. if someone winning 52% of their matches is unaffected by this change, then that means that the 52% win percentage players are going to have to continue playing poor EV events forever if they want to continue playing MTGO."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,dolpherx,0,Tue Jul 21 15:08:28 2015 UTC,"I analyzed it and the new system is roughly the same EV as the old system was when packs were 3 tix (which was pretty decent), provided all you want to do is enter more DEs with the winnings (I only analyzed the new vs old for DEs)."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,dolpherx,3,Tue Jul 21 17:40:45 2015 UTC,"So, if you're dead average with packs selling at 3.5 playing Dailies means a loss of 1.31 ticket while an 8-man costs you 0.70.  I honestly don't know which is the better option, probably an 8-man because of a lower time commitment, it's also single elimination which could be a + or a -, but it should come down to personal preferences in the end.  Saying these players should make a switch away from Dailies is probably an overstatement."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,TheBroccoliPlot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:15:04 2015 UTC,"It's a larger upfront investment to play in DEs now. That's a large factor as well. If your EV is worse, you require more time commitment, and you have to pay more upfront, that's significant motivation for people to leave. And then when you consider that competition will almost definitely get harder, these players will have an even lower win % and should be further motivated to stop doing DEs."

magicTCG,3e2u2v,johnts03,5,Tue Jul 21 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"While the EV might be better to the best players in the community, this change is worse for the community as a whole as the prize support is actually less than before.   This chart sums it up with math by valuing the packs at a constant which is how much it cost to wotc.  http://i.imgur.com/fBFlDqM.png  As you can see, in the Daily Events, the Entry Fee that Wizards gets has increased by 100% but it only increased the prize support by 28.6%. This means that it costs Wizards approximately 35% less than the old way to run the daily events.   No matter how you spin this, there is 35% less prizes in the prize pool compared to the current prize structure. Even though it might favor those that tend to have better win percentages, this change will also mean that the players with lower win percentages are now less inclined to play daily events, lowering your win percentages in DEs which means you think you might have better EV due to your current win percentage, but your current percentage is based on today's player composition. The change is quite large that it will change the player's composition in DEs that will lower your winning percentage most likely unless you are the best of the best of players on MTGO.  Overall, lose lose for the community."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,chayatoure,5,Tue Jul 21 15:21:15 2015 UTC,"You're right.  If you say that all pack prices are the same the new setup is a total screw job.  However, you are wrong to analyze it this way.  Let's look at a player with a win percentage of 50% and use the MSRP of 4 tix per pack.  Under this system an average player has a positive EV currently for daily events.  Such a system would drive down the prices for packs, which is exactly what happens.    In the MTGO economy pack prices will always be less than MSRP.  In fact, MSRP is worthless.  Only idiots buy packs from the store instead of buying tickets and then getting packs from bots.  So let's disregard MSRP completely.    So if we disregard MSRP, what price for packs do we use?  The price that bots buy them for since that is what we can get for them.    As I've said before, this new change screws us over if the pack prices stay at their current low levels.  If the pack prices increase (they should) then the new system is better for most players, period."

The reason pack prices decreased over time was all of the value stayed into the system. Pack price decrease was a good thing as a whole for the community, maybe bad for specific 2man and 8 man grinders, but as a whole was a net good. (I am a 2man grinder by the way, and yes, the new system is good for me for now until I can't find a damn game because no one will Queue up with a 12.5% tax)."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,johnts03,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:26:22 2015 UTC,"It's only better when pack prices are at their current super low levels. It's worse when packs are still relatively expensive (the first month or so of a new set release). I'm fine with them smoothing out the curve rather than the great value - terrible value curve that happens at the moment over a set's life span, but you're being disingenuous by not mentioning this and just saying that the new system is ""better, period."""
magicTCG,3e2u2v,TheBroccoliPlot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:50 2015 UTC,"Your reasoning is incorrect that pack prices are not determined by EVs. Picture this, if there is only one DE everyday and there are only 64 players in each of them. It does not matter whether the EV of these players change or not as the number of packs entering the system remains the same barring that the prize structure remains the same.   The reason that packs have decreased significantly from RTR Theros levels, it is due to change in supply and demand from RTR Theros to now. Lets simplify by saying that the majority of supply is coming from constructed players (constructed pays out packs but does not use packs to enter queues) and the majority of demand is coming from limited players (uses packs to enter tournaments).  The biggest change in the past couple of years that has made an impact in this ecosystem is that the change of PPTQs. During RTR Theros, when it was a limited PTQ season packs were way above 3 tickets per packs while when it was standard or modern PTQ season packs were hovering somewhere between 2.5 to 2.9. Due to the change in the PPTQ system favoring constructed more than limited, there is a decrease in demand for limited events on MTGO therefore lowering the demand. Furthermore, the people that used to just switch back and forth between limited and constructed on MTGO according to the PTQ season, now mostly only play constructed which increases the number of players in constructed queues.  This lowers packs prices.   Furthermore, your analysis of using today's pack prices with future pack prices is flawed due to not really knowing what future pack prices really are. This is the reason why using a constant is better in order to determine whether the change is good or not. My analysis was not whether the new system was better or not for the average player. It was an analysis whether the new system was better or not for Wizards. Since Wizards will see a decrease of 35.7% in its costs, that means that us the community will have to absorb this loss. How much of it exactly we do not really know as we don't know the value of packs in the future.   You cannot use an argument that since the new change will provide better EV for some players that it is good. This change will only be better for the top players only, the Reid Dukes of the world. If you are one of those guys then this change is most likely good for you, but I have not even fully analyze it for the best player, but even then if you were the best player you will have so many play points, what happens if you want to cash out some of it?  For the above average player, your winning percentages will decrease in daily events. This is due to lower prize support which is more top heavy than before means that players with lower win percentages will be less likely to play, and that means the above average player is no longer above average but will be average 50% win rate."

This change will cut the supply of packs in the system and lead to an increase in price.  They should probably also add more limited PPTQs and help increase demand, that would be nice.   Furthermore, your analysis of using today's pack prices with future pack prices is flawed due to not really knowing what future pack prices really are.   This is not a flaw.  It is why you can change the price on the speadsheet.  We are speculating about the results of a change.  In order to speculate we have to determine the effects at different price points.   My analysis was not whether the new system was better or not for the average player. It was an analysis whether the new system was better or not for Wizards.    Great.  I, however, only care about how a change affects me.   You cannot use an argument that since the new change will provide better EV for some players that it is good.   I've never anywhere stated that the change was good.  I simply did an analysis of the impact the change will have on different player abilities at different possible pack prices.  I don't make a living playing MTGO.  I play in queues and a few dailies.  My ability is such that I am not going infinite, but my EV is only slightly negative.    After doing this analysis I don't feel like that conclusion will change any.  YMMV.   I might play more 8-mans, though."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,TheBroccoliPlot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with a lot of people's analysis on here it uses a lot of variables and therefore the analysis is not as useful because the variables can change in a different direction or magnitude than the range that was originally used. That is why my analysis is more on how it impacts wizards' bottom line as pack value to them is constant. It is safe to say if Wizards is making the more money providing the same exact product, that the players are negatively affected. This change fits this description.  Also another thing that most people have not discussed is that the new change also hinge on the fact that if you do end up with a stock up of play points, that it is best to use it on limited events in order to ""cash"" it out. That means after the new change there will be an increase in players playing the limited events. Also the limited events EV will be better especially since the prize structure will not change. If you think the constructed EV will increase, the limited EV will increase even more, most likely encouraging some constructed players to play more limited, they also have to use up some of their play points anyways if they have extra.  If only people started this today. Lets say the average constructed players today play more limited events today, then the pack prices will not be as low as it is today and everyone's EV will increase way more than Wizard's new change.  Wizard's solution is basically the same thing as it will incentivize people to play more limited events as well as constructed, but now they get to encourage people to do this while also increasing their profit. Evil."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,GarrukApexRedditor,5,Tue Jul 21 18:44:46 2015 UTC,The fundemental flaw is the lack of fluidity in currency. Playpoints can only be used to buy entry.  Players cannot use winnings to build their collection outside of draft.
magicTCG,3e2u2v,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,13,Tue Jul 21 18:54:56 2015 UTC,This is somewhat true.  To get full value you must play in enough events to actually use up your play points. This is why I think it would be helpful if they allowed you to pay for entries with a mix of tickets and play points instead of the planned either/or option.
magicTCG,3e2u2v,mozerdozer,5,Tue Jul 21 15:49:34 2015 UTC,Wizards addressed this in their post as their 2nd goal.

Let's not forget that the seeming impetus behind this change was the community crying that pack prices were depressed (the economy was 'broken' I believe) so far that the EV for daily events was terrible.  WOTC has addressed this by reducing pack payouts, which should increase the price of these packs.  They have, however, increased the overall value of the payouts by introducing play points.    See the analysis for a nuts-and-bolts evaluation on how this change affects you."
magicTCG,3e2u2v,BrocoLee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"So they jack up the redemption fee, which is bad for us, causing the price of packs to drop, which is bad for us, and then they reduce the number of packs awarded in events per amount of money spent on events, in order to cause the price of packs to go up, and for some reason the sum of all this is good for us?"
magicTCG,3e2u2v,dolpherx,2,Tue Jul 21 17:01:17 2015 UTC,"They have decreased the pack payouts, which will increase the price of the packs, but even though they have increased the VALUE of the payout compared to today, they have actually decreased the COST of the payout to them.  Any change will increase the value of the payout compared to today, because today's payout value is in a problematic state, so you cannot argue that because the change increases the value that it is good as most changes will increase the value. What we are trying to get is not to increase the value from today's payout but more to get the payout value to resemble the value of payout to something like a year ago."

magicTCG,3e2cah,chrisrazor,2,Tue Jul 21 17:06:57 2015 UTC,"You're right of course, flipping her with no board state is just asking to have her face beat in as soon as she's flipped.

magicTCG,3e2cah,chrisrazor,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:14 2015 UTC,"Depends what kind of deck you're playing.  The front side is awesome, the back side is awesome, and she costs 3 mana. She's going to be welcome to land on 3 or 6+.  The flexibility is what makes her so powerful."
magicTCG,3e2cah,Nads89,0,Tue Jul 21 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"Y'see, to me the front side is not awesome. It's [[Sylvan Ranger]], which is a deeply meh card. Worse, in fact, because the Ranger can fetch any basic. Nissa's planeswalker side has a marvellous +1, but the card asks you to play a Landfall deck to get it, and there isn't really much of a Landfall deck yet.  Edit: sorry, I mean Borderland Ranger."
magicTCG,3e2cah,chrisrazor,3,Tue Jul 21 17:04:37 2015 UTC,"Nissa when you're stuck on 3 lands is awesome.  Borderland Ranger and Civic Wayfinder have always been playable, and those cards are trash in the late-game.  Meanwhile, Nissa is a beast in the late-game."

Standard is pretty skewed towards midrange right now; I'd be surprised if green decks don't regularly hit 7 lands in their games.

I agree that Nissa is great if you can flip her straight away, and ok early, though only getting a basic forest is horrible unless you're mono green or Gx.   7 mana is relatively easy to achieve with nonland sources, and I think after BFZ comes out we'll have tools like [[Harrow]] or similar to get there with land ramp. At the moment, though, creature ramp is where it's at in Standard, and that's not conducive to flipping Nissa."

Basic forests are fine in three color green. 7 lands is trivial and requires no land ramp or search excluding Nissa herself and possibly Wayfinder. Creature ramp is not the norm in Standard green decks. And even if you had access to a land ramp card like Harrow, you wouldn't want to play it just to flip Nissa."

So yes I am getting ahead. So is Wotc apparently. They already see that green is getting a little to powerful and are making adjustments. But the reason they have to make these adjustments in the first place is because they have cut out so many other things that green looks to powerful. Not because they are actually making powerful green cards. It is the wack-a-mole way of design. I have seen it in MMOs and tabletop games. It always ends badly.

magicTCG,3e1ppa,jeffseadot,20,Tue Jul 21 13:15:53 2015 UTC,"I think the issue isn't so much the comic itself, but rather the nature of the subreddit and what it considers content.  Part of being subscribed is accepting the fact that you will get a range of content quality. Sometimes you get in depth deck and meta analysis articles, other times you get ms word images of christmasland combos. Each respectively appeals to a portion of this sub's audience, and consequently gets onto the frontpage. For every set spoiler, there's an alter; every newbie post has its legacy deck showcase and primer.  Now the issue with cardboard crack posts, beyond appealing against (what might be) the vocal, non-casual minority, is that it is a low effort post. Note that I'm not saying that the comic itself is low quality--it's definitely not the best or the worst comic series I've read, and has its own style--but that the post  itself doesn't contribute much. While I respect that the cartoonist plugs at it consistently, each comic individually is low content and probably does not warrant a post to this subreddit; it isn't ""news"", has it's own website (and as a consequence isn't quickly read via a link image reader extension), and, most importantly, doesn't generate any conversation beyond the usual circlejerk. What we're left with is an external link to a quick chuckle and subscription at best; and while that is occasionally fine, there is a very fine line between legitimate advertising to a good source, and spam.  Ultimately, these posts simply become karma sinks for OP: they're brainless to post (as opposed to actually creating content by drawing them like the cartoonist), guaranteed to garner some points from fans, and presents the quandary of ""upvote because somewhat relatable MTG content by cartoonist, or downvote because shitpost by OP"".  Now imagine if these posts were text links along the line of ""How do you sort your cards"", or ""Don't you hate it when..."". Then at least you may get some replies in earnest about how each individual of this community plays MTG, and maybe a good story or two. Instead, we get inane and repetitive criticisms. Now, if the link sent me to some giant, 64 panel cardboard crack submission, then it might be a worthwhile item to share, but as it stands, if you enjoy the comic...good, just try to put some effort in before sharing."

magicTCG,3e1ppa,InvisibleMan5,8,Tue Jul 21 14:42:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the reality of reddit is that low-effort posts rise to the top as subreddits grow larger.  Posts where you can chuckle and quickly upvote garner more clicks and upvotes than higher-quality posts that take more effort to process.  That's just the nature of how reddit's voting and ranking algorithm works.  As a result, ""shitposts"" eventually strangle all the other content in your subreddit, as memes and image posts rise to the top.  That's why there's a vocal minority of people who are against alters, playmats, pictures of cupcakes, and links to Cardboard Crack.  Left unchecked, this type of low-effort content eventually takes over the subreddit, and interesting posts get stuck on the second or third page."

magicTCG,3e1ppa,Pravinoz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:00:22 2015 UTC,"Sure, and that’s great. I concede that one of the merits of these types of posts is that it provides an easy point of discussion, and it’s for these discussions that I stay on reddit. The problem is that, every time, at least one or more of those discussion points is along the lines of “Where’s the joke?”, which adds nothing to the conversation. Part of the problem of these dead end comments come from fact that they are low hanging fruit for these submissions; for such a contentious link, you almost guarantee yourself that a good portion of the replies will be unrelated to the actual topic of the comic itself and—if I didn’t know any better—would make it look like you are trolling for piqued responses. If you are genuinely looking for discussion, why use content that inherently has a terrible signal to noise ratio?  As an aside prompted by your instruction to look at your submission history (for the post about mana weaving), I was intrigued by what you actually submit. 15 of your 32 submission listed in the past 2 months were direct links to cardboard crack. Of those, 7 out of 25 search results for “cardboard crack” in the MagicTCG search engine listed under “new” are your submission for the site. Now comparatively, /u/cardboard_crack, who seems to be the actual cartoonist for the site, last made a submission 4 months ago. Now I don’t mean this as an ad hominem attack, and I understand that “reposters” such as /u/gallowboob are integral to this site’s function and popularity, I just would like to see discretion in what comics you choose to link. “Foil Tarmogoyf” and “Mana Screw”? Good and on point (especially with the timing). “Maple Syrup” and “Responsibility”? Maybe not so much. And while it is impossible to predict how well any post will do until you submit it, I think there is a point where you can draw the line."

magicTCG,3e1w0x,deviltone,11,Tue Jul 21 14:05:52 2015 UTC,"Not an attack on anyone or the message in the thread but the rule of 9 is a very, very basic rule for deckbuilding and isn't necessary information when you want to build a deck. It's kind of like training wheels; some people learned with them, others didn't know they existed, but they all learn to ride the bike at the end of the day."
magicTCG,3e1w0x,Snifflets,5,Tue Jul 21 14:15:34 2015 UTC,"Rule of 9 is useful for constructing basic linear strategies, like Red Deck Wins. You want every game to play out about the same way, kill your opponent before they stabilize, so consistency is important. It doesn't work as well for reactive decks like control strategies. You definitely want some number of Elspeth's in a control deck running white, but probably not four, since they're pretty bad early on. Similarly with boardwipes, whether you want three or four main is pretty meta dependent. Still, it's a good rule for new players who are trying to throw a brew together for FNM."
magicTCG,3e1w0x,AMathmagician,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:38:10 2015 UTC,I find most decks actually play 10 different cards rather than 9. Often people want say 6 combat tricks and 22 land.

I've been leaving something in my side as an answer to particular matchups, but now that I think about it, it fits much better with my anticipated win condition most of the time to the point where I'm actually just going to start with it from now on and side it out when the match up is bad.  Thanks! =D"
magicTCG,3e1w0x,PhiloSofie,3,Tue Jul 21 11:23:46 2015 UTC,"the rule of 9 is not good advice. it works for some decks, where a very high degree of redundancy is both possible and desirable (for example, white weenie deck), but is absolutely terrible for many other kinds of decks (any control deck, for example)."
magicTCG,3e1w0x,metaphorm,9,Tue Jul 21 15:03:09 2015 UTC,"While I agree that it doesn't work for every deck, it's a better thing to follow than 'pick 36 of your favorite singletons' that a LOT of new players are prone to do. It teaches consistency without being too hard to remember and stick to.   As I've said, the guidelines aren't perfect and some things like that need to be playtested and worked out on a case-by-case basis but they will at least help steer the player in the right direction."
magicTCG,3e1w0x,aznsk8s87,2,Tue Jul 21 15:23:53 2015 UTC,"It's good advice for someone building their first deck. From there, during testing they can see what they're not needing as much and can cut, and look for different cards to fill in the holes in their strategy. Goes from all 4's to having two sets of 3 and a pair of a new card. Or having 4 sets of 3 cards instead of 3 sets of 4. But it makes a great starting point."

I'd make this part much, much stronger. Once you've built a deck that follows all of these rules, break the rules. Play within the rules until you understand them, and then kick them aside.  An easy one -- ""the rule of 9."" GREAT introductory rule of thumb! But once you start to grow, especially if you're playing with new cards -- you'll recognize that different cards can share a role, but have different strengths and weaknesses, like modern Black removal (Murder catches all for a lot of mana; Silence the Believers handles recurring monsters and auras for even more; Ultimate Price obviously misses Gold and colorless; 1-cost removal usually can't kill a 2/2 but it's the only way to stop a turn 1 Elf)."

magicTCG,3e1w0x,rifter5000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:31:22 2015 UTC,"To chime in on mana curve I might put more of an emphasis on capping the mana curve especially in formats like legacy.  A lot of decks there cap at 3 or 4.  So an emphasis on thinking how you want to be casting spells and if you'll get a chance to cast certain spells.  Also certain archetypes don't line up with a clean curve, especially combo. Elves goes 1,2,3,4,8 for example.  In reality the curve is 1,2,3,4 with an outlier card that doesn't really count."
magicTCG,3e1w0x,cferejohn,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:06 2015 UTC,"2) Pick an archetype. An archetype is basically the idea or game plan of the deck. Aggro decks are fast and aggressive, Control decks kill and counter anything the opponent might have until they can play a big late-game finisher and Combo decks abuse some sort of interaction between cards to win, like Sanguine Bond + Exquisite Blood. Midrange decks are sort of a mix between Aggro and Control.   Holy shit! What a terrible article that Wikipedia one is, especially the 'Recent design philosophy' article. That's the most one-sided bit of writing on MTG this side of Mark Rosewater's column.   Nothing in that article mentions the extremely high levels of criticism pointed at that article for its midrangification of Magic's metagame balance."

magicTCG,3e1w0x,Kominyetska,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:04:16 2015 UTC,"And keep in mind almost none of this advice applies to EDH/Commander. So if that's your format:   Format is commander? There are no real archetypes for commander decks. Each deck style is decided by its commander. So pick a commander that just looks like fun and has a lot of cards that would complement/synergize with its abilities. But maybe don't get something super aggressive, or everyone will target you every time, leaving no room for politics. Your deck should be full of various win conditions. It's a slow format, and you can only have 1 of any given non-basic-land card. Don't be afraid to include a bunch of bombs, which is probably what most of the game's significant plays will consist of. Don't you even worry about this, since again all non-basic-land cards are unique in a commander deck, and there are 100 of them. You can almost never expect consistency (outside of tutoring commanders), so you have to rely on synergy with anything that might come up. And when we say ""removal"" we mean ""board wipes"". But yeah removal/disruption isn't bad either -- preferrably something repeatable, like Gwafa Hazid, Profiteer, because one-time removal effects in a card can be seriously lacking in value in such a slow format. Counterspells can still be good, though, primarily for preventing one of the players from setting off their win condition. Lol. LOL."
magicTCG,3e1w0x,tkms,2,Tue Jul 21 16:42:18 2015 UTC,"While true that none of this advice pertains to Commander, this advice isn't something that I would link someone who actually wants to get into it.   There are no real archetypes for commander decks.    I'm afraid you're wrong about there being no archetypes in Commander. Commander does have established archetypes, they just often can't be categorized as something as clean cut as Aggro, Control or Combo. A deck's type might be looser or less prominent than 60-card constructed but the fact of the matter is that if your deck has cards in it that do something, there is an archetype associated with it.   Your deck should be full of various win conditions.   100% agree, a lot of the most successful Commander decks I've seen have been things like Goodstuff where almost every card is capable of single-handedly winning the game if left alone.   Lol.   Would you disagree that a solid commander deck isn't focused?   LOL.   Mana curve is still very much relevant in Commander. While it's usually not nearly as low as 2.5 CMC, it's still important to ensure that you curve out nicely. There's a reason why people playing entire decks of 1-2 CMC burn and 8CMC fatties aren't winning many games."

I can't count how many times on here I've seen suspicion of someone acting nice after being known for being rude, speculation that it's not genuine or authentic. As if being nice was anything but trying not to be rude. As a philosophical question, does being kind when it's your natural proclivity show any sort of character? Isn't it more impressive to see someone working against their default, short/aggressive tendencies to be more thoughtful and kind?   I'm not trying to stir up the ZJ issue, and not even making a statement on it.

It is allow computers to ""dream"", which is distorting the images and adding other images to them while keeping the coherence of the first image. There are some really beautiful results. You can search the internet for them"
magicTCG,3dzlih,UncleMeat,9,Tue Jul 21 03:15:01 2015 UTC,"Google uses a technology called Deep Learning or Neural Nets to solve a lot of problems. One of these problems is image recognition. You can train one of these systems to do things like identify humans or buildings or birds or whatever in images. You feed a whole bunch of labeled images to the system and it sortof learns what it means to ""be an image of a bird"".  The problem is that its hard to tell whats going on inside of these systems. If something is wrong you can't really debug it. That's where Deep Dream comes in. What Google does is take an input image and make minor changes so it better matches the thing that the Neural Net is trained to look for. Then it repeats this process. The end result is that the system ""finds"" images of eyes or faces or dogs or buildings or whatever else it was looking for in images of other things. This produces a somewhat abstract or ""dream like"" image. If the image doesn't end up containing the things that you expected then you know the system has been trained incorrectly.  But it also produces pretty pictures for people."
magicTCG,3dzlih,Khaim,3,Tue Jul 21 06:08:26 2015 UTC,"Google created a neural network (i.e. an ""artificial brain"") to recognize images. To make a neural network, you construct the basic framework and then train it on some sample data. They knew how the basic parts worked (they built them), but not the end result. So they took the trained network and sort of turned it inside out and backwards. It's hard to really explain without going into the details of how neural nets operate, but the end result is something between ""dreaming"" and ""acid trip"".  So the original brain worked like this:   [picture] -> ""dog (90%) table (50%) cat (5%)""   The ""dreaming"" network works like this:   [picture] -> ""dog (90%) table (50%) cat (5%)"" -> [picture made of lots of dogs and a few tables]"
magicTCG,3dzlih,UncleMeat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:57 2015 UTC,"I'd be very hesitant to call a neural network an ""artificial brain"". Laypeople already really misunderstand NNs and they really don't behave like brains at all once you get past the neuron metaphor."

Having LSV call it the best constructed card in the set sure is saying something.  Also, surprised to see Fiery Impulse making the Top 10. Giving up slots in a deck for creature removal that blanks on all of the format's bigger threats seems awkward. Hitting a Deathmist Raptor/Fleecemane sounds like a nice tempo play, but it just seems like in almost every case imaginable a mix of Wild Slash and more consistent removal spells would be better."

magicTCG,3e2imh,propheseed,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:53 2015 UTC,Facepalm.  I'm confused.  Are you saying OP was metaphorically punched by ppl complaining to WOTC?  Are you agreeing with me?  OP has right to express himself where others do not?
magicTCG,3e2imh,coppersulphate,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"Artwork is supposed to move you, to evoke feelings.  Getting pissy because art makes you have a feeling is ridiculous."
magicTCG,3e2imh,propheseed,-7,Tue Jul 21 14:16:30 2015 UTC,That would be ridiculous.  Good thing noone is saying that.  Its ok for YOU to get pissy though about other peoples opinions right?
magicTCG,3e2imh,coppersulphate,0,Tue Jul 21 14:20:34 2015 UTC,Their complaints are harmful to the game. This post is not.
magicTCG,3e2imh,propheseed,-5,Tue Jul 21 14:18:30 2015 UTC,Lol. Try explaining that one.  Complaints show that people are interested and care.  They are a sign that the game is healthy and attracting all types of people.  Including those who can't handle differing opinions clearly..
magicTCG,3e2imh,Whelpie,2,Tue Jul 21 14:22:16 2015 UTC,"Complaints do show that people are interested and care, I agree with that. However, that's not the potential outcome of the complaints. The only thing those complaints can achieve is to limit the diversity of themes and art in the game, which is of course harmful."
magicTCG,3e2imh,propheseed,-6,Tue Jul 21 14:34:23 2015 UTC,I would not be heartbroken if WOTC ceased printing images of dead children.  I fail to see the harm in it.
magicTCG,3e2imh,Whelpie,3,Tue Jul 21 14:47:29 2015 UTC,You're not the only magic player in the world. Many people such as OP and I (and probably most players) would be upset to see the art and story of the game become shallow and uninteresting.
magicTCG,3e2imh,coppersulphate,-7,Tue Jul 21 14:55:34 2015 UTC,"Omg.  I'm sorry that you think you and OP are closer to most players than I am, but we will have to disagree!  You speaking out against a vocal minority, and forming an even smaller one in doing so.  How that makes you like ""most"" players is beyond me..   would be upset to see the art and story of the game become shallow and uninteresting   Thats a huge leap from people having a problem with this particular concept.

For the record, I never said a thing about the card until this post, which I was responding to out of its absurdity more than my being affected by the card.  This card however is a great example of what I was saying.  Its ethereal, hard to make out the age, and was snuck in as token art."
magicTCG,3e2imh,Renxasis,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:40 2015 UTC,Why does a dark image need to accompany dark flavor? That kinda defeats the point. The major contrast between cute and death is what makes the card so special and unique. There can't be dark without light.   And you say that it should be less obvious and direct...but the art should be dark to match the concept? You seeing the contradiction? This card was a curveball.   And find it funny all you want. The difference is that my bitching doesn't impact the future of the game.

magicTCG,3dz7i6,klapaucius,28,Tue Jul 21 17:15:08 2015 UTC,"That's not fair to the story designers at all. If you actually read through the whole arc of Urza and Gerrard, his whole character is garbage.  The initial brother's war is a pretty good story telling trope, and the early days of antiquites make for some good moments. But during the whole weatherlight saga, Urza is brought back for hype value, and he acts as a godlike asshole throughout the whole thing. He makes MAGIC MECH SUITS and the story team thought that was a great choice for the magic universe.  The storyteam's explanation for the change in planeswalkers was that having godlike protagonists meant that they could never be related to; their challenges have to be completely outerworldly. And they're totally right. Nobody likes Gerrard, and people who like Urza don't really like his character. They like the overwhelming godlike powers that Urza represents..  I don't understand the people who defend The Weatherlight Saga. It's terrible garbage with small moments that are desperately mediocre. And this claim that Wizards wants to retcon Urza is a total overreaction.  The stories of Magic the Gathering are mythologies. They're meant to transcribe great events across the ethos and universe. Urza had his time, and was very important, and now Karn is the lasting influence of him. And at some point this will be true of Jace. He'll be dead, his influence living on in another form, and they'll be new stories: probably of someone called Blace, and he'll be a poor-misunderstood boy who learned the magic of his ways to control Blandomancy or whatever.  The point is, we can't go backwards. The story today is written by different people with different tastes for an audience with different needs. And if you think the current writing team would ever bring back Urza in a way you're happy with, you should know that you can never go home."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,WaffleSandwhiches,99,Mon Jul 20 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"people who like Urza don't really like his character. They like the overwhelming godlike powers that Urza represents..   I like Urza because he is a powerful, but ultimately unsubtle, introverted, flawed character with godlike powers.  One of my posts spent some time in the shoutbox, and it was to describe Urza.  He was a fool.  He unleashed a great evil on the multiverse.  He sacrificed his brother, his wife, his progeny, his allies, and even his only friend.  He was not a healthy or happy person.  But we had to make do because his nemesis, Yawgmoth, was so much worse.  It was the contrast between Urza and Yawgmoth that made their characters great.  Urza was ultimately penitent--he had done much evil in his life, and now fought to do good.  And though he was brilliant, he was also inept.  His skill with machinery was unparalleled, but his social skills were a mess.  He made enemies much more easily than friends, and his powerful schemes often forget about the human element--that his pawns were people, and that one of them was the closest thing to a son he'd ever have.  Yawgmoth was everything that Urza was not.  Yawgmoth was a skilled manipulator, to the point that he was worshiped as a god across multiple worlds.  And though he was charismatic, Yawgmoth didn't really have any friends--he had worshipers, and pawns, and enforcers, but no one who treated him as an equal.  While Urza blundered about, trying to save Dominaria, Yawgmoth built a smooth, well-oiled machine to remake it in his image.  But ultimately, Yawgmoth was driven by jealousy.  Urza was a planewalker; Yawgmoth was not.  And ultimately, his perfect creation of Phyrexia was doomed.  The plane would eventually collapse.  Yawgmoth was defined as much by his position of worship as he was his primal need.  Urza was the opposite--a man who was happiest when left alone with his creations, but this wasn't the fate that was dealt him.  I like Urza because he was an example of a character who had godlike powers but was ultimately still impotent.  He was someone who was simultaneously very smart and very stupid.  He made decisions that saved the world--and also those that doomed others.  While contemporary fantasy protagonists were the unflappable likes of Drizzt Do'Urdan, Urza was a very human character who was defined by his mistakes as much as his successes."

As are all the old gods. Zeus. Odin. Loki. Hades. That's just western/norse mythology. People who think that gods have to be flawless probably never read a lot of old stuff.

magicTCG,3dz7i6,king_bestestes,18,Tue Jul 21 13:30:13 2015 UTC,"people who like Urza don't really like his character. They like the overwhelming godlike powers that Urza represents..   You're mostly right for me, at least.  I don't like Urza for his character.  I missed the whole part of Magic where he was developed as a real character in the story.  I played from roughly Revised through Ice Age.  When I first started playing, you could still find boxes of Antiquities and Legends in stores.  I saw The Dark release, Fallen Empires, Ice Age.  What I remember most about that era was something we can't realistically recapture.  There were no spoilers.  Almost nobody had perfect knowledge of what was in a set after it released, either.  So one of my fondest memories was learning about the story of early Magic through card names and bits and pieces of flavor text.  Urza and Mishra were obviously very important.  But it didn't hit you over the head with what the story was about.  You knew there was a conflict.  You knew they were immensely powerful.  You want to learn more?  Pay attention.  Rosewater calls this ""archeological dig"" style of storytelling, and I agree that's a great analogy.  I like Urza because he represents a mystique around early Magic.  A Mystery that they can't go back to, but today they also refuse try to do so even in the small ways in which they can.  Even with perfect knowledge of sets and spoilers that hit the internet before a set comes out, you can still leave things vague.  You can still have something larger than the characters that's not fully explained.  Something you have to pay attention to to get the story out of that isn't just outright told to you in a bad UR story.  The sense of wonder and discovery was a big part of the joy of early Magic.  They can't bring back all of it, but they could do some of it.  That they don't even try is kind of disappointing."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,pyromosh,9,Tue Jul 21 00:06:44 2015 UTC,"I forgot how great ""piecing it together"" actually was. Fallen Empires is a good example. The cards were dirt cheap and mostly underpowered, but god did I wish I could read the Sarpadian Empires after all that art and flavor text."

You had this continent far away from where the Brothers' War happened and yet they are affected by the changing climate. This place isn't as large or advanced as the main land, and so the impact is greater. Each color had two factions at war, and then even enemy colors fighting (Goblins/Orcs vs Dwarves, Goblins/Orcs vs Merfolk, Merfolk vs Homarids, etc.).   I wouldn't mind a point of view style story from the different factions, as they start with the enemy colors (Icatia vs Orcs, followed by the Ebon Hand, the Farrelite zealots, and finally death from everything else) disappear as one of the shared color faction becomes dominant."

magicTCG,3dz7i6,ShootEmLater,2,Tue Jul 21 06:32:34 2015 UTC,"YES, THIS. I started playing a little later than this guy, around Mirage, but the feel was the same. You didn't have the cheeseball plainswalkers or outright main characters in the game itself. Sure, there were legends, but it was more of a mystery, you had lore that wasn't completely fleshed out, tidbits here and there, and it was fun. Then planeswalkers sparks? People becomes 'superheros?' What? And i'll form the head. That's so boring. I came back in around Mirrodin, was turned off by a lot of new mechanics (and especially the new card face, WOOF), and then stopped again until I recently decided to build a cube. The game just isn't as flavorful or interesting as it used to be. I still love it, and there's probably a lot of nostalgia going on, but it's been 22 goddamn years. It got too shiny and polished for me, and the art is especially much less alive than it used to be. Dark Souls hits that perfect balance of dingy, dirty fantasy that I loved and sparse, detail hunting storytelling."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,ManagingButts,9,Tue Jul 21 08:25:24 2015 UTC,"Honestly, you can tell me it was bad writing all day. I don't care. I loved reading the stories around Urza in the cards. Maybe I didn't feel connected, but I wanted to see all the cards to know what happened. I wanted to see scenes played out in cards. I wanted to read the books and fill in the blanks.   The point is, we can't go backwards. The story today is written by different people with different tastes for an audience with different needs. And if you think the current writing team would ever bring back Urza in a way you're happy with, you should know that you can never go home.   But you are 100% correct here. It's over.

Another Planeswalker comes on by for a visit (Elspeth), kills a giant beast and saves a bunch of people. For that the Sun god is like, ""That was neat. Have a gift."" Then the first planeswalker gets his wish, taking godhood and causing havoc among mortals. Mortals and gods clash, with the second planeswalker becoming a champion of the people. Turning the sun god's own gift against the heavens, she slays the walker-turned-god. However the Sun god can't have the mortal populace thinking this is an okay thing to do and slays the second walker. A third walker and good friend of the second cries a lot and wears her old clothing. The end."

The defeat of Mogis's army is the first real connection between Elspeth's storyline and Xenagos's. Xenagos's whole ""WTF there are Eldrazi and Phyrexians out there; I can't deal with being a Planeswalker"" shit-fit. Phenax, the Returned, Ashiok, and all that. The Nyxborn: enchantment creatures from Nyx leaking into Theros, ultimately becoming an assault by the gods against mortals in general.

magicTCG,3dz7i6,KynElwynn,2,Tue Jul 21 04:11:26 2015 UTC,"To be fair, how much of this could you actually work out from the cards?  Xenagos is only mentioned in eight pieces of flavor text. Two cards mention his false godhood, one card directly mentions his death (depicted in another card), and the rest simply talk about how he is a bit of an anarchist. That's it, as far as Theros' core story seems to be involved in the cards.  As far as I'm aware, Elspeth's death isn't mentioned at all. Phenax and Ashiok get name-dropped on a couple of cards, with no context. Nyx and the Nyxborn, Akros and Mogis are mentioned really vaguely.  It's...thin, at best.

magicTCG,3dz7i6,Uncle_Oj,44,Mon Jul 20 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty much sums up my thoughts. I just can't believe how much they basically went out of their way with Origins to avoid anything outside of the current Jace+Friends story. Pre-mending Dominaria was supposed to be one of the ""feature"" planes, but we didn't get a single card to show this. Instead, useless generic garbage like ""Cleric of the Forward Order"" supposedly represent the plane."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,mulltalica,21,Mon Jul 20 20:35:42 2015 UTC,"I think consumers misunderstood the ""origins"" label to mean Vorthos origins within the game since it's inception.   Rather, it was origins for the game mechanically and origin stories for it's more front-and-center characters since PW's were introduced in-game.   I'm disappointed that there are no elaborate and familiar Dominaria references but I really didn't expect any once I saw Liliana's pre-PW card face.   Don't forget that MTG players are fickle and demanding. There was a time where they grew very, very bored of Dominaria and it began to feel boring following the Weatherlight crew across at least 9 card sets.   It almost feels as if Time Spiral was their way of blowing all of that up and reshaping it into what the game and lore is today."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,FalconHunter,15,Mon Jul 20 21:11:18 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying the whole set should have been Dominaria and MTG Origins as a generic term. I understand that Jace+Co were the focus.  What I don't understand is they went through all the trouble to make Liliana a pre-Mending walker, make her from Dominaria, and yet we got no real references to the plane. The other walkers had cards completely unrelated to their story and just there as flavor for the plane, yet Liliana's origin is entirely forced down to just her mess up with saving her brother and her walking on Innistrad."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,mulltalica,9,Mon Jul 20 21:17:50 2015 UTC,"Liliana's origin is entirely forced down to just her mess up with saving her brother and her walking on Innistrad.   That doesn't really feel forced though. I have a neutral perspective with no investment one way or another (pro-Neo or con-Neo lore) but is there really any story for Liliana above and beyond her origin?   Regardless, I do hope that some kind of return to Dominaria is in the very near future. We've been taken to a created-from-scratch world that originated as an artifact on Dominaria (Mirrodin) and we've been exposed to the Phyrexians in this neo-lore order. So when do we get to return to the roots?   There's a magical xmas land wishlist for Urza as a PW or some other kind of ""this would never work as a card"" kind of desires but all I want to see Magic NWO elements as applied to early Magic locations, concepts, lore, and maybe even a few characters (COUGH JAYA COUGH)."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,FalconHunter,10,Mon Jul 20 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"I guess I just got extremely hopeful at the fact that Liliana was probably running around at the same time as all of the characters of old, yet we got zero little references or easter eggs. I just think it was a huge missed opportunity, especially since this is the last core set and now any ""old world"" references are left to Commander releases."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,mulltalica,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:38:01 2015 UTC,I remember reading something in one of the articles explaining the lack of nods to old Dominaria.

magicTCG,3dz7i6,DancingC0w,17,Tue Jul 21 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"There's a point to that though. Origins is not about returning to the roots of the Magic story, it's about their new storytelling strategy. They want Jace and friends to be the new magic because they are marketable and recognizable characters to build a brand around, unlike the characters from the brothers war who are not household names.   People joke about the whole ""magic justice league/avengers"" aspect of it but its basically intentional because like it or not, Jace and Co. are now the face of the franchise and without a doubt will be appearing in basically everything magic going forward because at least one of them will probably always be in every block going forward."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,DivinePotatoe,17,Mon Jul 20 21:01:11 2015 UTC,"I understand that Jace and Co. are the new face of Magic. What I don't understand is that one of their star walkers is not only from the original main plane of MTG, but she's also from the same time period as many of the original characters. This would have been the perfect time to give a little nostalgia to people who having been playing since the beginning. But instead, all we get is generic cards being labeled as ""from Dominaria""."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,mulltalica,8,Mon Jul 20 21:11:10 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're coming from since I've played magic since before there even was an Urza block, but bringing back all the Dominaria characters would dilute from the goal of marketing to make the 'Jace and Co' group the faces of magic. Hell, they even ditched characters like Sorin and Garruk, who truth be told I like more than Lilliana and Nissa. It's also hard to evoke nostalgia with classic reprints due to the power level of cards being so vastly different.  Edit: It's also important to remember that just because Jace and Co are the center of the story now doesn't mean we can't see other characters. I'd be surprised if Sorin stays out of the story for much longer given the uncharte realms between him and Ugin, and who knows maybe someday we'll see some time travel shenanigans a la Fate Reforged that bring the old characters into contact with the new characters."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,DivinePotatoe,10,Mon Jul 20 21:19:58 2015 UTC,"Hell, they even ditched characters like Sorin and Garruk, who truth be told I like more than Lilliana and Nissa.   They didn't really ditch them, they just aren't listed in the 5 most major characters. Heck, Sorin will probably have a role in the next block."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,SleetTheFox,8,Mon Jul 20 21:27:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't get how Sorin was ""ditched"" when he was core to the events of zendikar, part of which is related to Tarkir through ugin. He was huge 4 years ago on Innistrad, and in khans block he's been a big supporting character because he's about to become one of the stars again."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,LordZeya,3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:25 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I get what their game plan is and I get that they want the focus on those characters. I've been playing since Urza's block first released, and I would have loved to see something as simple as printing a card referencing Urborg or Benalia for Liliana. That would give the older players a nice nostalgia moment, give Liliana a stronger tie to the overall MTG universe, and still not detract from the focus on her.

Abzan midrange vs Trix, an issue does occur when two decks that are the same colors and similarish archetypes play vastly different cards will be labeled as the same deck."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,kushwonderland,8,Tue Jul 21 00:13:22 2015 UTC,"I just can't believe how much they basically went out of their way with Origins to avoid anything outside of the current Jace+Friends story.   That's literally the purpose of the set. You might as well have said ""I just can't believe how much they basically went out of their way with Innistrad to avoid anything outside of a gothic horror world where humans, supposedly under the protection of a benevolent angel, are besieged by monsters."""
magicTCG,3dz7i6,SleetTheFox,4,Mon Jul 20 21:05:45 2015 UTC,"That's fine and all, except one of their main characters is from the exact plane and time period as the original over-arcing storyline of MTG. They basically went out of their way to ignore telling anything about Liliana's homeplane to instead specifically just focus on her spark igniting and her walking around Innistrad. We got plenty of random cards unrelated to the walkers to flesh out Regatha, Vryn, Theros, and Zendikar. But Dominaria is completely ignored in that sense."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,mulltalica,8,Mon Jul 20 21:15:10 2015 UTC,"There are cards from Dominaria, too. But the difference is Dominaria is so generic that it's difficult to truly ""flesh out"" when it's the focus of 1/10 of the set. You can get a feel for those other worlds with much less text than you can with Dominaria."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,SleetTheFox,0,Mon Jul 20 21:24:26 2015 UTC,Dominaria is generic? So you're saying that all 14 years of MTG from Antiquities to Future Sight is generic and all the same? There are plenty of unique areas of Dominaria they could have referenced.
magicTCG,3dz7i6,mulltalica,15,Mon Jul 20 21:35:00 2015 UTC,"Dominaria has no identity is what I'm saying. Part of that is because it has 14 years of Magic set on it. There's all sorts of areas of Dominaria with lots of character and variety, but Dominaria, as a whole, has no identity of its own. They could either focus on one small part of Dominaria, or they could have a hodge-podge of seemingly-unrelated cards. And since Liliana's home doesn't seem to be an already-visited part of Dominaria, the former is not an option. Neither of those approaches is as simple as the other planes, who can easily be defined with just a tenth of a large set."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,SleetTheFox,3,Mon Jul 20 21:43:29 2015 UTC,"I always thought Dominaria's identity was ""traditional fantasy world,"" with shit like wizard schools, fighting pits, ancient evils, lost empires with superior technology, and exotic continents with different cultures and forms of magic.  Maybe I'm just a grumpy old man, but I kind of prefer that approach to the theme planes they have now. It just felt bigger and more complex."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,Platypus3333,5,Tue Jul 21 03:48:28 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing whether everything on Dominaria is better or worse than the current plane-hopping approach, but it's still pretty tough to communicate ""traditional fantasy world"" with one tenth of an expansion, especially when those traditional fantasy elements appear on other planes. There are wizard schools on Alara, fighting pits on Ravnica, ancient evils on Zendikar, lost empires with superior technology on Vryn, and planes basically are exotic continents with different cultures and forms of Magic."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,SleetTheFox,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:54:58 2015 UTC,"I started playing during Revised, and for me, the traditional fantasy world aspect was communicated over time because it was established that all the events depicted in the sets canonically took place on the same plane. So there was a great sense of continuity for me because I felt like I was playing through the history of the world of Dominaria. While the current model still has an overarching story involving Bolas, it's somewhat in the background and the main threads are more character based - like the main impact of Innistrad on the larger MTG universe is how Liliana and Garruk came out, and the main impact of RTR is how it affected Jace."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,Platypus3333,2,Tue Jul 21 04:45:22 2015 UTC,"That's mostly because we leave planes. The fate of Innistrad only matters so much to players when we leave Innistrad, but seeing what the events did to Sorin and Garruk gives the events more gravity in the mind of most players."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,SleetTheFox,2,Tue Jul 21 05:40:12 2015 UTC,"The cards for other walker planes are just as hodge-podged. For example, look at Graveblade Marauder. It has nothing to do with Jace's story, has nothing to do with Jace's colors (Vryn was designated U/W), and is not one of the ""strictly worse"" cards that are throwbacks to more powerful older cards. There is literally no reason for it being in the set other than to show us a random tidbit about Vryn. So why couldn't they have done something similar with Dominaria?"
magicTCG,3dz7i6,mulltalica,2,Mon Jul 20 21:58:59 2015 UTC,"I would agree with you that their handling of Vryn was not very good. So I'm not sure it's the best comparison. They were able to give a good snapshot of what Kaladesh and Regatha were about, as well as the returning planes like Theros and Innistrad, because their ""thing"" is easily grasped. Dominaria has too much variety for that to be feasible on a small canvas."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,SleetTheFox,3,Mon Jul 20 22:23:45 2015 UTC,"except one of their main characters is from the exact plane and time period as the original over-arcing storyline of MTG   Dominaria is enormous, and ""pre-Mending"" is a time period that encompassed millennia. Just because we got a glimpse into Lily's village for a tiny fragment of time doesn't mean we'd see anything that happened in previously-established story.   Plus, to reiterate what others have already said, the focus of this set was purely on these five 'walkers. That we got the Dominaria painland cycle and the reference to Jaya Ballard was a surprising treat for old-school players, but certainly not one we were entitled to just because we visited Dominaria again."

Without having a real context of how old Lilli is, those wars could just be relegated to old textbooks by the time she was born. Being studious, she may know of them, but it's possible that their impact on the world has passed."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,VonIndy,2,Tue Jul 21 08:07:59 2015 UTC,"She may have not even been on the plane when the Phyrexian War was taking place. We really have no reference for just how old Lilli is, just that she's pre-mending (which puts her in a fairly interesting club regarding known, surviving planeswalkers; Lilli, Sorin, Nahiri, Bolas, Ugin, Khan. One immortal, one vampire, one Kor that is somehow still alive, two dragons, and a golem)."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,EruantienAduialdraug,2,Tue Jul 21 09:04:09 2015 UTC,"The effect on the world of the Napoleonic wars hasn't really passed, in the indirect sense. They're responsible for the formation of a lot of the factions in World War I, which changed the western hemisphere arguably more than any single historical event. Now imagine that instead of invading Prussia, Napoleon tried to fuse it with the soil of France and wipe out the Germans with genetically engineered plagues. And then say, I was endowed mysteriously with a knack for Napoleonic artillery. And then say one of Napoleon's friends showed up out of nowhere ""We're going to shell France into oblivion!"" and suddenly all I could do is load cannons particularly fast. At this point, the ""200 years removed"" would cease to be a distant, historical truth, and something more personal and immediate. I certainly should at least have Napoleon on the mind some of the time.  There should be a trace of that conflict, the way there are traces of historical events here. A set featuring an inhabitant of our world could charitably include cards representing, say, The Great Wall of China, even though we're centuries away from the conflict between the Chinese and central Asian tribes. Or representatives of political factions like Neo-Nazis or communists, even though those ideologies are nearly or more than a century old, respectively.  And lastly, they aren't even including anything from Lilliana's time and location. All the gave us was the Cleric, which had no connection to anything. If they want to write an intervening history of Dominaria between when we see it and Invasion block, more power to them. Instead they're pretending Dominaria doesn't exist, and focusing on helicopter-world. Lilliana might as well be from Innistrad."

magicTCG,3dz7i6,notaballoon,6,Tue Jul 21 05:45:28 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing about Magic creative: Old Magic creative was a bit pulpy, we all know that, and maybe some of us are looking through it through rose colored glasses. But the fact is that modern Magic creative sucks. Sorry, it just does.  It's not merely a matter of storytelling. The whole artistic oeuvre of Magic cards is extremely anemic and unexciting. The art on cards is digital, comic book homogeneity, and artists appear to be actively discouraged from developing unique styles. The result is that the cards are not pieces of art, but rather depictions.   A similar process occurs with the flavor text. While original flavor text ranged from witty to poignant, current flavor text favors stagnation and exposition. Consider [[Fate forgotten]]. Are you kidding me? Flat exposition. Even the most expositiony text from old cards, like, say Mishra's Workshop, has a certain resonance. The flavor text on fate forgotten barely has anything to do with the card. It's like they said ""how can we beat them over the head with this time travel thing? I know, let's stick some shitty expository text on a card no one will play!""  Like, fine, if Magic wants to move to weird new places, but a) they should hire some creative with some actual stones who can put a sentence together and write some characters with some depth, and b) if you can't do that, maybe don't shit all over the old work and pretend it didn't happen? Mirage block was a shining jewel of creative: innovative, dynamic, and one of the best examples of a truly unique, non-western style fantasy universe. To hold that up next to Theros, a slapped together ripoff of old episodes of Xena, and say ""yeah, we should focus more on the one we stole from Hercules"" is a rather egregious and arrogant artistic trespass."
magicTCG,3dz7i6,-33rpm,2,Tue Jul 21 04:28:09 2015 UTC,"Man I totally agree. I used to LOVE magic when I was a kid - I was totally shit at playing it, but the cards were so captivating and the art was so evocative I was hooked until the inevitable break when I went to college. I got back into the game on and off around Scars, for nostalgia, and then Innistrad really got me back into it. There were so many good looking cards, like real, old magic cards! I feel since then, though, it's been pretty downhill. I was SO psyched for a returning to Ravnica - but then when it came it was a watered down shadow of what City of Guilds et al was. Instead of a cornucopia of mystery and eastern european influence it was a bland metropolis with the attempts to give depth to the world forced onto you with uninspired flavour text.  And then we get to Origins, and with the exception of Infinite Obliteration (and perhaps Despoiler of Souls?) there's not a single card that stands out from the rest in terms of art (reprints aside). Despite several mechanical home runs in terms of flavour (incredible job from the design team there), there's not a single card I can think of that has that combination of art and flavour text that made me love magic in the first place."

I'm much more interested in the resolution of the Zendikar storyline, or Innistrad after Avacyn's awakening, or the current events on New Phyrexia.

Also, the people you see complaining about the story might not be the same people that complain about power creep/loss who again might be different from the people who complain about rules changes.

magicTCG,3dz7i6,Timiniel,2,Tue Jul 21 05:25:55 2015 UTC,It's worth pointing out that Magic has been growing significantly since about 2008. The Weatherlight Saga finished in 2001.

magicTCG,3dyncw,TheOtherBatman,54,Mon Jul 20 17:03:56 2015 UTC,"1.5 times the payout is impossible to know until we see the effect on (actual, not MSRP) pack prices.  Edit:  hijacking my own post to make one important point.  You need a ridiculous win rate of over 62% to ""go infinite"" with just play points in Daily Events.  This is the point where your expected number of play points you win per event is equal to 120 (entry cost into the event).    The upshot of this factoid is that you will still be using some combination of play points and tickets to enter events.  This will make play points effectively equal one ticket.  The nightmare scenario is where you are winning so many play points that they become effectively worthless to you .   Since this is not the case, the below EV calculations that assume 10 play points equals 1 ticket are corect.  It all boils down to how this effects Origins booster prices.  If they stay at 3.5 tickets or better, then this is a good change for everyone who is at least 50% or better win rate.  If they stabilize at 3 tix you need a win rate of 52% to profit from this change.  At 2.35 tix your win rate has to be 55% or better.   TLDR: 10 play points will effectively be worth 1 ticket since it will be impossible to go infinite on them in daily events."

magicTCG,3dyncw,fundosh,76,Mon Jul 20 19:32:48 2015 UTC,"Before I realized that they doubled(!) the entry fee , I was somewhat OK with the changes since at the conversion rate of 10 play points = 1 tix, the dailies now pay out more  at the cost of not being able to use your prize to buy more boosters/cards.   But nope. They want to charge you $12 for a constructed event(when most LGS with higher upkeep costs will charge you much less than that) and then pay out play money which can only be used to enter other events (much worse than store credit which can be used to buy singles/sealed product). Winning 6 packs for going 4-0 in a $12 event is just laughable.   They claim that they are listening to player feedback but what these changes do is make it more expensive for players to join constructed events and more expensive for players to build a collection (since play points can't be used to buy product).   If these changes come into effect, I will probably just liquidate my collection and stick to drafting or just quit MODO entirely."

magicTCG,3dyncw,TheCardNexus,97,Mon Jul 20 17:04:18 2015 UTC,"While you are technically correct, those numbers lie. The MSRP of packs is, frankly, worthless information in this context; it's their value at the secondary market that counts. As of right now, the payout per player is 4.42 tickets, using pack prices from MTGGoldfish (2.34 for DTK, 1.41 for FRF). Giving play points a value of 0.1 tickets and Magic Origins the same as the average of DTK and FRF packs (1.875 tickets), the EV remains almost exactly the same for these new daily events (8.86 tickets per player, with twice the entry fee). And since there are fewer packs awarded as prizes now, it seems fair to assume that pack prices will also rise, resulting in an increase in EV.  Now, I'm not suggesting that this is fantastic stuff, but I wanted to point out how this is a flawed way of analyzing the changes."
magicTCG,3dyncw,Hahahopp,21,Mon Jul 20 17:41:21 2015 UTC,I don't think the pack prices will be as low as the khans block when this new rule is in effect. This is due to the lower number of packs entering the market from constructed events.

magicTCG,3dyncw,fracguru,30,Mon Jul 20 22:21:26 2015 UTC,"It depends what you think your match winning percentage is and what boosters go up to.  Assume you have a 50% match winning percentage. This means you'll go 4-0 6.25% of the time and 3-1 25% of the time.   Suppose packs go up to 3.5 (lofty, imo, but for the sake of argument) and Play Points are valued at 10 PP per ticket (which I don't like since they're untradable and only have one use, so the utility decrease should make it slightly less than 1:10, but let's ignore that).   4-0 pays out the equivalent of 57 tickets. 3-1 pays out the equivalent of 28.5 tickets.   So the EV of playing a daily under the new prize structure is:  0.0625 * 57 + 0.25 * 28.5 - 12 = -1.31 tickets per DE   For the current prize structure, let's say DTK packs are 2.4 tickets each and FRF are 1.42 each (what Supernovabots has them at atm). Using the same 0.5 match winning percentage, the EV is:  0.0625 * 22.48 + 0.25 * 12.44 - 6 = -1.485 tickets per DE   In other words, the new system is superior.   If you change it to a 60% match winning percentage, you now go 4-0 12.96% of the time and 3-1 34.56% of the time.   Re-doing the math:  New: 0.1296 * 57 + 0.3456 * 28.5 - 12 = 5.24 tickets per DE  Old: 0.1296 * 22.48 + 0.3456 * 12.44 - 6 = 1.21 tickets per DE   So again the new system is superior.  Of course, keep in mind, that this assumes boosters go up to 3.5 and a 10:1 play points to tickets ratio.   Let's say boosters only go to 3.33 instead and re-do it.  New with 50%: -1.50 tickets per DE Old with 50%: -1.31 tickets per DE  New with 60%: 4.93 tickets per DE Old with 60%: 1.21 tickets per DE   Finally, at 3 tickets per pack:  New with 50%: -1.875 tickets per DE Old with 50%: -1.31 tickets per DE  New with 60%: 4.33 tickets per DE Old with 60%: 1.21 tickets per DE   TL;DR: New system is better EV at all match winning percentages above 50% if packs go up to 3.5 tickets or higher. At 3.33 tickets per pack instead, new system is only better EV at ~52% match winning percentage is higher. Otherwise current system is better below that. At 3 tickets per pack instead, new system is only better EV at ~55% match winning percentage or higher."

magicTCG,3dyncw,matunos,16,Mon Jul 20 18:00:31 2015 UTC,You need slightly higher than 62% MWP for that to happen. That's difficult for most players to attain. You can also use those points to join PPTQ's and other high level events if you can't spend them quick enough. I really don't foresee that being a problem at all.
magicTCG,3dyncw,gooseygoose88,8,Mon Jul 20 18:12:11 2015 UTC,"This calculation doesn't take into account that play points can't be used to buy product or traded to bots to buy singles. In the old system 100% of the payout is tradeable. In the new system, only 35-40% (assuming 3.3/pack value) is tradeable. Therefore players who are looking to accumulate tix and build their collections might be better off in the old system despite the slightly lower EV at 50-55% win rates (which is probably the reasonable range for most players)."
magicTCG,3dyncw,sleightofhand,2,Mon Jul 20 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"However, the current really low pack prices are not the norm. Even if the economy has been very bad, DTK was a 3.2 for a long time while FRF was at 2. With those prices, even with Origins at 4, the new system is still worse."

So if someone invests in tickets and cards up front to grind a large amount of Play Points, it sounds like you're going to lose that prize equity if you want to cash out of Magic Online, right? That seems like total garbage, and I would be surprised if that was not a silent motivator for this change."
magicTCG,3dyncw,sloth_clunk,10,Mon Jul 20 22:14:41 2015 UTC,"Something I haven't seen anyone mention yet is that you can enter drafts with play points alone, this means that one way to liquefy play points is to grind drafts (paying out in tradable boosters). You could also just rare draft with play points alone and then drop for a much less currency efficient method (but quicker if you're trying to cash out I suppose) but this is more of a workaround than an actual feature."
magicTCG,3dyncw,SometingStupid,179,Mon Jul 20 20:52:20 2015 UTC,"Constructed Daily Events [...] reflect the highest level of regularly available competition on Magic Online. As such, we are increasing the number of event tickets used to join to reflect this and help distance it from the eight-player queues. Since the quality of play in Constructed Daily Events can be quite intense, we expect some players will stick to the queues. Choose the level of event that is right for you.   Oh so Pauper dailies are 12 tix now huh?  With less payout?  And if I don't like it I can play 8-mans?  Wait there are no Pauper 8-mans!  Fuck you very much Wizards.  I guess I'm finally done with MTGO.  It's just no longer worth my money, my time or my nerves.  Hey wizards if you didn't want people to actually play your shitty game you could have said so.  Man I'm so pissed right now."

But I do recognise the economy was flawed and low pack prices made a lot of constructed events lose/lose situations. How do constructed players feel about this?
magicTCG,3dyncw,Wooberg,41,Tue Jul 21 03:21:05 2015 UTC,Seems like no one is happy lol. The constructed players don't like it as it now costs 12 tickets to enter a constructed daily. The limited players also don't like it as this new change will mean that pack prices will increase which means drafts become more expensive.
magicTCG,3dyncw,dolpherx,13,Mon Jul 20 18:23:28 2015 UTC,"Well, to be honest I don't know if I have ever seen any sort of Magic related announcement met that the public vocally responds positively to. Except maybe the one about the new two-block structure. That went over pretty well.  Now, when stuff goes into practice people sometimes cheer up, but initially it's almost always negative."
magicTCG,3dyncw,22bebo,22,Mon Jul 20 16:39:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm I think most of the community responded to the new mulligan rule incoming at PT Vancouver positively. I myself am looking forward to the change. Also as part of that announcement, most people like the direction where Wizards is taking in terms of the requirement for matches played in feature matches that are streamed. Otherwise, I am not sure which announcement you are referring to. Most of the recent announcements that Wizards has announced where it sparked mostly negative response are still considered negative, otherwise Wizards have rectified their original announcement.   As an example, when Wizards first announced the recent Pro Tour changes, originally some of the community were not happy that all the pro tours were all going to be standard. So wizard responded quickly by changing a pro tour in a given year to modern and also changed some of the GPs from standard to Modern."
magicTCG,3dyncw,dolpherx,30,Mon Jul 20 18:29:36 2015 UTC,"This is just as bad for constructed players. The old problem was that sometimes events would become bad value, and players wouldn't want to play because of this. For some reason, they thought that a good solution would be making Constructed events always bad value while making it more expensive to play Limited events."
magicTCG,3dyncw,gereffi,106,Mon Jul 20 21:46:32 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, dailies are twelves dollars to play now?  And the ""points"" given out to use for other events are NOT tradeable...?  All around awful."
magicTCG,3dyncw,pestertwin,34,Mon Jul 20 22:03:45 2015 UTC,The one bright side is that Phantom Points are being discontinued and merged into these new points.  So Phantom Points are becoming a bit more useful.

I don't know how much phantom points are worth, but I have trouble believing that it's exactly $0.60. But I don't know if they're worth more or less than that. If more, then a lot of customers are being ripped off; if less, then I know what I'm investing in over the next month."
magicTCG,3dyncw,taschneide,12,Mon Jul 20 16:56:01 2015 UTC,"Currently the holiday cube is 10 tickets to enter or 16 phantom points.  That makes a phantom point about $0.625, which is pretty close to the right value (and doing 7 player points per would be way over valuing them)."
magicTCG,3dyncw,paulHarkonen,4,Mon Jul 20 17:11:06 2015 UTC,"I mean, right now they might as well be worth literally nothing as far as I'm concerned. There is no way to turn phantom points into anything besides more phantom points. I can't get packs or cards or tickets or anything else out of them. At least when they're play points I can use those to enter drafts and get cards/packs, or enter DEs and get packs. This is the one unquestionably good change they're making, imo."
magicTCG,3dyncw,UninterestinUsername,13,Mon Jul 20 18:48:05 2015 UTC,Packs being tradeable is what brought on this change. Making the points tradeable could devalue them similar to packs of recent and then we are at the same spot we were before.
magicTCG,3dyncw,trny3,19,Mon Jul 20 19:38:31 2015 UTC,"Packs being tradeable becomes a problem because Constructed events pay out in packs, and Constructed players don't want packs. The supply goes up compared to the demand.  These Play Points are MTGOdimes in the same way that Event Tickets are MTGOdollars. Event tix have been stable at approximately $0.95 forever. If Play Points were tradeable, they'd be stable at just under 10 cents."
magicTCG,3dyncw,SteveGuillerm,2,Mon Jul 20 22:11:29 2015 UTC,"I think devaluing is happening also because prize payouts always pay out the same sets.  Some kind of diversifying of the packs would help.  Changing sets for payout on rotating days, allowing users to select the sets, or paying out in older sets could help alleviate this."
magicTCG,3dyncw,pestertwin,10,Mon Jul 20 18:55:48 2015 UTC,"But the ""points"" are exchangeable for drafts or DEs. So if you 4-0 a daily event you get 6 packs and either 3 free DEs or 2 free drafts and some change."

magicTCG,3dyncw,wilmheath,120,Tue Jul 21 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"I don’t know what number attempt this is, but I’m now on more than a few attempts to put my frustration into words with these changes. I’m probably not going to succeed as well as I would like, because I’m having difficulty putting all of my thoughts into words. These changes are a combination of greedy, misguided, stupid, and lazy. Of course, I think that about most changes the Magic Online team makes, so using those words fails to convey that I think these changes (as currently written) are a bigger mistake than the current client. I hope there’s room for at least some changes (like the 12-tix DEs), but I have no hope that this will be the case. Regardless, I’m going to attempt to write down what I find most egregious about these changes.  They are attempting to fix the wrong problem. The problem (as I see it), is that there are too many cards becoming trapped on Magic Online. This is not to say that the problem is too many cards being given out, as WOTC would like you to believe. For a long time, redemption worked as a safety valve that kept digital cards maintaining a certain level of value, by acting as a peg to a more substantial form of value (paper cards). This level was sufficient for keeping packs in the 3.5+ tix range and keeping 2-player queues playable (in addition to every other event on MTGO). Unfortunately, WOTC decided this was suboptimal to their profits.   What came was a period of constant attempts to increase these margins, first by moving more events to ticket-only entry (such as Release Events), then the redemption fee increase, Cube events and Phantom points, etc. The redemption change was by far the most damaging of the changes, but it was certainly not the only one. The end result was a serious overreach in an attempt to improve profitability, one that has threatened to kill the Golden Goose that is Magic Online and destroyed many players’ faith in the program and its economy.   As an aside, Magic Online is a fascinating economic experiment in creating a digital economy of goods whose value mirrors physical commodities despite facing no similar production/acquisition costs, supply issues, etc. The Magic Online Economy Strike Force was run by a team with zero economists (by Worth’s own admission). It has always existed as an incredibly fragile system. Having people who fail to understand their own ecosystem in charge of something so fragile has always been a dangerous proposition. And now it’s broken. End aside.  The current set of “solutions” attempts to solve the issue of too many cards in Magic Online by reducing the number of cards being given out. It is Wizards’ attempt to keep their (presumably highly profitable) redemption fee change without suffering the costs elsewhere. To put this into economic terms, the redemption fee change was a tax levied on a good (complete MTGO sets) by a government (WOTC). The new economic equilibrium would require MTGO to lower production, which would only have happened by a significant dropoff in players. Fortunately for WOTC, this equilibrium was never found. Unfortunately, constant production that failed to respond to lower demand meant a constant series of ever-falling card and pack prices. WOTC’s solution is now to artificially cut production through these changes, through a two-pronged prize cut of making some prizes non-transferrable while also increasing their rake.  Why is this a problem?  The biggest problem with these changes is that they are short-sighted and anti-growth. Each MTGO player, on average, produces more cards than he or she uses. If this assumption were incorrect, cards would become increasingly scarce as more people played, specifically Standard cards. Obviously that isn’t the case. Players give WOTC money specifically to print MORE cards. The nature of draft/packs/etc. is that each player ends up with more cards than he or she has a use for.  This used to not be a problem because the safety valve of redemption always let those cards flow freely to a place of comparatively much larger demand (paper Magic). WOTC broke that safety valve intentionally. Unfortunately, WOTC has also decided that the problem is with too many cards being printed instead of the problem being that they broke the safety valve. By doing so, WOTC has guaranteed that the MTGO economy will grow more unstable the more MTGO grows, and that these problems will consistently resurface insofar as they manage not to kill the program. They have chosen this as preferable to an economy that thrives as it grows, because this is more profitable for them in the short term. By reaping the rewards of these cuts now, they’re able to defend that they’ve grown profits despite the nightmare that was the V3-V4. They’re doing so at the cost of future growth.  One of the most important issues about this is that it’s not about pack prices. Many of the changes made WILL improve secondary market pack prices...because secondary market pack prices become mostly irrelevant. What do pack prices matter for? The value of your prize. Your cost to draft. Note, pack prices are affected by card/set values, not the other way around. Increased pack prices will NOT make your BNG complete sets worth more.  Now of those two things pack prices matter for, how are they changing with the new system?  Your prizes have been significantly decoupled from packs (because now you get play points). Congratulations, you are not benefitting from this pack price change nearly as much as you care about it right now, and the cuts to events certainly outstrip the rise in pack prices (people have posted spreadsheets in this thread). You draft a lot. Congratulations, your drafts now cost a lot more.  Pack price problems have been an easily seen symptom of a suffering economy. Attempts to stabilize pack prices are a band-aid because pack prices are not the wound that needs to be healed. Pack prices are most relevant for WOTC because the bigger the discrepancy, the less people are willing to play and the fewer people are willing to buy for the store. As you’ve probably gathered from this, WOTC has solved pack prices in a way where the only ones who benefit from the changes are them. Stop acting like what they’ve done is a good thing that players will benefit from. We won’t. Like every other change WOTC has made, we lose.  The most depressing part of Magic Online is that it eschews profiting via economies of scale, always favoring cost cutting and price increases. Were Daily Events too good? No. They were not. Daily Events were a loss-leader. They were great for getting players to open the program and check the event schedule. What happens when you missed the Modern Daily that fired 10 minutes ago? You joined an 8-player queue or fired a draft. What happened when you 0-2 dropped that Standard Daily you joined with 5 seconds left? You dropped and tilt drafted. Now there won’t be any rushing to make the 6:00 Legacy Daily because it’s lost its luster.   Moving Magic Online from having nothing but -EV events instead of a few +EV ones is important. Mathematically, it is a small change for most people. But psychology is important. A bunch of advanced math degrees will not make people want to play Magic Online. For a program that relies entirely on people wanting to play so badly that they put up with the program, the psychology of loss-aversion should not be ignored. But it has been. And in doing so, not only has WOTC burned us, but they’ve burned themselves. We’re all worse off for these changes."

Magic has a much deeper draft because you can signal, counterdraft, play around cards, and it feels fair in an underpowered pod, but they take two hours longer. They could go the opposite direction and fill downtime with another really cool Magic variant that you can only play on the downtime that makes you want to spend the time waiting for other matches to finish, or they could just decouple Magic entirely from paper Magic and make simpleton Magic.  I think a really cool idea would be to have an interface complexity track to your rating. As you get better, you appreciate and value all the stops that are set, and the new player can get a quick Hearthstonish game in. The downsides are hard to overcome, there are a couple that I could mention, but I think that would be a really cool concept to implement."

magicTCG,3dyncw,guyincorporated,28,Mon Jul 20 21:21:37 2015 UTC,"The alternative is the following:  make draft games happen as quickly as possible.  That means if you're in a swiss event and you and another person finish match 2 and are 2-0 (and therefore locked to play eachother next match), then just start that match now.    It also means that once my third match is done...give me my cards and prizes immediately!!  if I finish my 3 rounds of swiss, does it really matter how everyone else did?  Just give me my damn prizes so I can keep paying you money!  By the way, having those extra tickets in my account (and having them sooner) may just be the difference between me starting another draft immediately versus going to bed because I know it'll be another 30 minutes to get my payout.  This is a tangible benefit to your bottom-line WoTC, and an issue I'm shocked isn't brought up more."
magicTCG,3dyncw,22bebo,21,Mon Jul 20 21:22:24 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure these ""issues"" exist because MTGO wants to mimic real life Magic, especially the competitive side of it, as much as possible. This means unbiased fairness takes priority over a lot of other things. Your proposed system would be biased towards pairing fast decks against other fast decks, as opposed to fairly pairing players to each other randomly.  As to your second point, I think that happens because they apply a blanket ""tournament structure"" to all tournaments, which is what drafts are considered on MTGO. So, while the placements of other players doesn't matter much to the person in 1st place in an eight player draft, it does to the person struggling for 8th or 16th in a bigger event, because tie breakers matter a lot more there. So, by giving prizes out once everything is set in stone at all tournaments, you have to wait for them in draft. To be honest, I can't think of any issues changing this for smaller tournaments would bring up."
magicTCG,3dyncw,guyincorporated,6,Mon Jul 20 22:09:17 2015 UTC,"This means unbiased fairness takes priority over a lot of other things. Your proposed system would be biased towards pairing fast decks against other fast decks, as opposed to fairly pairing players to each other randomly.   Forgive me if I misunderstand, but I'm not advocating for a bias.  The example I listed is one where there is no chance of you being matched against a different party.    Every live 8-man I've done at a gp included a bracket.  I see no reason that the 8-4's couldn't function in the exact same fashion.  Know what else?  After I lose in an 8-man draft in person, they hand me my prize tickets and let me move on with my life.  I don't just have to sit in limbo while other people play out their matches."
magicTCG,3dyncw,22bebo,5,Mon Jul 20 19:11:57 2015 UTC,"Nope, I think I misunderstood your idea upon rereading it.   That means if you're in a swiss event and you and another person finish match 2 and are 2-0 (and therefore locked to play eachother next match), then just start that match now.   I missed the part about it being round 3 of a swiss tournament. You're right, there shouldn't be any bias because neither of you could play anyone else in the tournament.  I will say that every live 8-man you've played at a GP includes a bracket because players can be seeded based on how they did during days 1 and 2. Online, there's no information with which to seed players so the only way to do it fairly is to do it randomly, thus why it is done that way as opposed to a bracket.  And as I said before, I think the lack of paying people once they're done with the draft is due to an issue with the infrastructure surrounding tournaments on MTGO and I don't think there would be an issue with switching to the system you propose outside of the time and money it would cost to program that. I can only assume WotC has decided that that time and money is better invested elsewhere on MTGO."
magicTCG,3dyncw,georgism,3,Mon Jul 20 20:13:30 2015 UTC,At gp's there are side event 8 man drafts. It brackets according to seat order. 8 people sit at a table and you draw two x's. Player seated in one corner played the opposite and and in the inside the same. Seat two plays seat seven.   That starts the bracket.   From that bracket it's easy to see who plays who next round  and even more obvious for the finals.  Online can do that and should pay out once dropped and it is aware of your ending record. Unfortunately right now it is so bugged that you can't even drop anymore and guarantee it will remember your record correctly for the current round. It's rough.

There's no reason (well, philosophically, I don't know if there is some technical limitation that I don't know about) Duels can't be set up to eventually replace MTGO and allow people to port over their collections other than the fact that Wizards don't seem interested in putting in the work to make a better product.   The limited card pool is not a feature that is somehow making new players happier than if they had access to a full card pool. I don't know that there's any reason to think Timmy new guy is loading up Origins and going ""I sure like that I can't get a Dragonlord Atarka in this game, it's sweet!"" but it does make sure that experienced players are pushed away from Duels with the hopes that maybe they'll end up on MTGO from lack of a better option.   Honestly, if the janky decks arising from the pool is so critical to new players for some reason, you could easily have a ""kitchen table"" format in duels where the card pool is earnable through free packs, and still support a proper constructed format that would work the same way MTGO does. The only reason we don't have that is because Wizards thinks MTGO is ""good enough"" and they deliberately keep Duels bad so that long time magic players don't switch to that."
magicTCG,3dyncw,UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2,11,Mon Jul 20 17:37:29 2015 UTC,"There's no reason Duels can't be set up to eventually replace MTGO   There's lots of reasons to maintain separate products which target different audiences; the two groups will only rarely, coincidentally, have the exact same needs.  And absolute elephant among those reasons is the level of development effort and precision necessary to satisfy tournament players. The Duels backend servers doesn't need to support hundred-player tournaments; Duels doesn't need to implement 3000 cards of Legacy/Vintage only cards with perfect adherence to the comprehensive rulebook; the Duels team won't ever need to worry about a tiny bug in Spirespine ruining the outcome of a $1000 match in a PTQ finals.   Wizards don't seem interested in putting in the work to make a better product.   It's completely absurd that you can complain about this in the same thread as people complaining about Wizards Time and ""Soontm""."
magicTCG,3dyncw,itwashimmusic,15,Mon Jul 20 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"You keep using ""bad"" but I think you mean ""simple"".   Duels is programed with limited card interaction.  There is a select pool of cards, a limited number of them, and the interactions are all mapped.  Corner cases don't happen on Duels because they aren't possible.   MtGO has to be able to deal with the corner cases, all the cards, and every possible interaction.  You are also able to have any number of them, and they can be used in any way the game allows.    That's a lot of calculating difference."

magicTCG,3dyncw,cheatonus,28,Mon Jul 20 18:32:49 2015 UTC,"Competitors? Who plays Magic Online that aren't generally fans of Magic the Gathering?  I don't consider Hearthstone a competitor to MTGO.  MTGO is an outlet for people to play magic online who either can't or don't have time to play in paper.  It isn't a game in and unto itself like Hearthstone.  In other words, it exists to virtually emulate an existing tabletop game.  It's a tabletop simulator for a specific game.  Here's the reality, and why there's so little seeming improvement.  There are no competitors to MTGO.  If you want to play sanctioned MTGO events outside of an LGS you must use MTGO.  I think you're mistaken if you think the strategy of MTGO is for mass appeal and huge casual playerbase... that's what duels is for.  MTGO is for the hardcore spike and the casual competitor, not the kitchen table player.    Edit to say this:  I would even go as far as saying that Wizards would be happy to drive off the casual player to the new digital product, Duels, and preserve MTGO for the hardcore and competitive player.  It means they can manage the growth of a product which is probably much less infrastructure intensive, being that the multi-player games are probably peer-to-peer instead of server based and put less money into maintaining infrastructure for a product that is it's official platform for sanctioned online events.  Why would they want to have their infrastructure processors bogged down by people playing casual janky decks in fun queues when they can have these same people doing the same thing on Duels?  I wouldn't be surprised to see the free rooms also decline in availability as well."

EVERYONE at my LGS plays Hearthstone, and as long as that is there to keep them occupied in their downtime, why would they ever buy into MTGO?

That's like saying Call of Duty is not a competitor to Battlefield, because you can't play Battlefield on Call of Duty. Sure, they are different games, and the die hard fans of Battlefield won't switch to Call of Duty just because the new Battlefield is a little worse, or because the latest patch messed up the balance, but the average ""shooter"" fan, or the casual gamer won't think twice about switching franchises.  More and more people are leaving MtGO in favor of Hearthstone. Most people don't really care what the exact game they are playing is, they care about the fun factor and, to a certain extent, the cost.  If they can have comparable or even a better time playing hearthstone, at a fraction of the cost, then I'm sorry, but they won't give a shit that Hearthstone doesn't virtually emulate Magic.  It's true that MtGO has a niche and it will probably always be able to keep a decent player base, but it's also important to understand that it shares a significant target demographic with hearthstone. Even then, Hearthstone is chipping away at that niche. Most people would argue that MtGO is for more hardcore and serious players and that Hearthstone is a more casual game, but notice that the prize payout for the 2014 World Championship of Hearthstone was more than twice the payout of the 2014 World Championship of MtG, so Hearthstone is starting to look very appealing to even the most serious of players."

Casual people AND competitive people play Hearthstone. Because they have the ability to. If a player chooses to be competitive, they spend shit-tons of money on buying packs/arena drafts/expansions so they can get all of the cards they need without slugging it out doing dailies. Other competitive players (like myself), were in no rush to obtain all of the cards that I needed, slugged it out via in-game currency and hours spent playing and still am happy.   I also realized as I was writing this that, if they reduce the cost to almost nothing to play MTGO, it may reduce incentive to play paper Magic, and this may be a reason why MTGO is pay-to-play. If this may be a concern for Wizards, why don't they just tack on a monthly fee to use the service, OR price each individual card with a monetary cost and an in-game currency cost.  There are many ways they could make MTGO more appealing to both casual players and competitive players. Shit, make certain competitive aspects of the game cash buy-in only to still make money."

magicTCG,3dyncw,22bebo,7,Mon Jul 20 23:11:46 2015 UTC,"The current issue, from what I understand, is that boosters are too prolific in the economy, making them cost too little. This makes constructed level events have a negative payout, since their tradeable prizes are 100% booster packs.  By introducing this new system, Wizards provides a new method to enter events that is not dependent on the inconsistent price of booster packs, and they increase the overall price of booster packs on the secondary market by limiting supply.  Also, the reason Wizards cannot just handout tix as a prize support is because then MTGO falls into the realm of online gambling, I believe, making it subject to completely different regulations and a completely different public image that I believe Wizards wants to avoid."

magicTCG,3dyncw,sirgog,9,Mon Jul 20 18:10:31 2015 UTC,"Posted something on this in /r/mtgo . Here it is:  Can MTGO Constructed play survive the changes?  A good Constructed player will wind up with basically limitless Play Points, which will be completely worthless to them unless they also draft.  If you have no interest in Limited, under the new system the 2 player queue has no prizes, the 8 player queues only pay out to 1st and 2nd, and the Daily Events only pay 15 packs per 16 entrants, while entry fees are partially or wholly subsidized (depending how good you are) by the Play Points you win.  This removes in one fell swoop the ability to 'grind' in MTGO Constructed, and the idea that 'if I get better, I can make money out of playing Magic'. While that idea is an illusion for most people, it is a central factor keeping people playing.  These changes ensure that Constructed-focused players cannot realistically trade their prizes for cards they want out of new sets, which will probably impact demand for new cards sharply.  MTGO's had some great changes over the years and some stinkers. This is up there with the redemption fee changes in the 'stinker' category. Where that change hurt Limited play badly, this change threatens to do the same to Constructed."

Which is somewhat unusual because if you go to the ""tournament practice"" room you get the same basic experience as a 2 man daily, but without having to spend money. It's not like the larger queues that at least force you to pit yourself into a trial versus multiple opponents.  At least with the old booster packs systems, if you're ""giving away"" value, you get at least some cards which add to the global pool of cards for players to play with. Now you can just watch your value slowly bleed away without a single new card being added to the general economy, unless you do limited in between constructed matches.  Which, because value bleeds off for the community in every event, will probably be mostly relegated to the big winners in constructed."

magicTCG,3dyncw,Nekomancer42,4,Mon Jul 20 19:57:12 2015 UTC,What changes will there be to entry fees & payouts to Phantom events? (Literally the only thing I care about with MTGO).
magicTCG,3dyncw,Monkeibusiness,4,Mon Jul 20 21:46:04 2015 UTC,"So you have to win 14 BO3s in a 2 player q in a row to finance yourself one booster draft. Infinity here I cooooome~!  Nah, these changes aren't bringing me back."
magicTCG,3dyncw,Rich_Shay,5,Mon Jul 20 20:32:53 2015 UTC,"I posted this on The Facebook, but I will paste it here as well.  Magic: The Gathering Online is making a series of changes to their prize structure. In the past, winning a two-player queue would provide a booster pack which you could sell for TIX.  That is all changing. Instead, when you ""win"" a two-player queue, you are given ""player points."" These ""player points"" are only able to be used for entering further events. They can't be traded and they can't be used for anything other than entering new events. You can't use them to build up your collection, and you can't use them to do anything but enter more events. They can't be cashed out via turning into new sets.  Before, winning a two-player queue helped you build your collection. Now, winning a two-player queue gives points that have very little use or utility. I don't see any upside to having a lot of these points.  I am extremely disappointed by these changes. Before, winning a larger event brought you closer to having a better collection. Now, winning a large event gets you more of these generally worthless points. Winning a Magic: The Gathering Online tournament doesn't even seem worth the time anymore.  From my perspective, I only play constructed on Magic: the Gathering Online. I have little interest in qualifying for a Pro Tour. But I do have an interest in expanding my online ""collection"" to try out different decks. From that perspective, this new change is very negative."
magicTCG,3dyncw,HawkEyeTS,4,Mon Jul 20 21:16:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't been on MTGO in a while since selling off my collection a few months into the v4 client, but I'm still not seeing any incentive to come back.  Especially now that it costs even more up front to play in events I'd probably lose, and packs will likely rise in price leading to more expensive drafts, which was the one format I had a snowball's chance in hell of getting about half of my entry fee back in.  Bravo Wizards, I didn't think you could make me want to play MTGO less, but you went that extra mile."

magicTCG,3dyncw,YoggiM,8,Mon Jul 20 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"I still can't believe these changes. Daily Events currently cost 6 tix and pay 6 packs to 3-1s and 11 packs to 4-0s. In a 16 players event (considering no one drops), there are 96 tix consumed and 35 packs awarded. If we convert packs to 4 tix (because that is how much they cost in the store) the event pays the equivalent of 140 tix. Converting both of these to the Play Points we get 960 to 1400.  The new system costs 12 tix or 120 Play Points and pays 3 packs + 180 Play Points for 3-1s and 6 packs + 360 Play Points for 4-0s. Again assuming a 16 players event, there are 1920 Play Points consumed and just 1800 Play Points paid.  How is it possible that they double the entry fee and only barely upgrade the prizes? Not only that, but part of the prizes are untradable so if I keep winning eventually I'll have my account flooded with those and that's also pretty bad.  The solution is simple: make the Dailies cost 6 tix or 60 Play Points and make the prizes for 4-0s 6 packs plus 200 Play Points and for 3-1s 3 packs plus 120 Play Points. This is a direct conversion from the current prize structure and the best way to test this out.  I won't play a single event while the announced structure is in place. I won't sell my stuff but I won't play. If after a certain point nothing changes, I'll sell most of my stuff and keep cube drafting until I run out of Play Points."
magicTCG,3dyncw,TheKniphoon,3,Mon Jul 20 17:19:02 2015 UTC,"Change to dailies sucks a lot (went from almost always positive EV for average player to never positive EV), but 2 mans being usually playable even if boosters tank is nice."
magicTCG,3dyncw,FinalCactus,3,Mon Jul 20 19:46:50 2015 UTC,"Fewer packs being paid out in Constructed means fewer packs getting traded to bots. Fewer packs floating around the economy will drive up their price on the secondary market.  This will not diminish demand for boosters, since it will always be cheaper to enter limited events with boosters than with event tickets, and the reduction in demand from boosters via phantom draft winnings being usable for drafting is more than offset by all the constructed  queues (which fire far more often than limited events) which no longer pay out in boosters. This will only increase booster prices, this is known.    This is good for the very best limited players, who consistently win more in prizes than they spend on events, since higher prices for packs mean more event tickets when excess are sold to bots. This is bad for everyone else.   It's pretty easy to see, since more people spend more than they win, that this is bad for more people than it is good. I don't like this at all, and this is coming from someone whose winnings exceed spendings. This makes limited less accessible. This also moves a greater portion of the economy into being 'untradeable', which ultimately just has the end result of making things more expensive and gives people less control over their collections/mtgo assets. I really am not happy with this change at all."
magicTCG,3dyncw,QuixoticMcGee,4,Mon Jul 20 23:01:48 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely awful. Two-mans are a complete spew of value where you can only work within the Event ecosystem.

We'll always have those play points that we have to use and can't get any other value from."

magicTCG,3dyncw,VintageRuins,4,Mon Jul 20 17:54:54 2015 UTC,"Emailed them and expressed my disappointment. I'm just getting into this game now, moving from Hearthstone and before that WoW TCG. Already dropped about 250$+ on cards, and was considering MTG:O too: up until now. I won't be bothering if the prices are this ridiculous."
magicTCG,3dyncw,Cardhoarder,5,Mon Jul 20 20:41:48 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty late to the party here, but here are some thoughts on the changes.  My initial thought was this is very, very bad for MTGO and its economy.  Upon further review, I think it actually might be what we had been asking for to stabilize pack prices.  8-mans have a worse payout if you look at Boosters as $3.99, which WOTC has always done regardless of the secondary market price.  However, the player points act almost a value floor here because they are going to be equal to the same amount of event entries regardless of the secondary market prices.  As such, if the secondary market price of boosters is ~ 3.5 tix or less, these payouts are actually better.  The points not being tradable seems problematic, but only 1st place gets ""excess"" points (above a single re-entry).  Dailies that is not the case.  Cashing out this value is difficult - you essentially have to use them to draft/sealed prior to doing so.  So, this mostly affects those people who grind high value from events (not sure what winning % we're talking about here - someone better at math could figure that one out).  No question the changes to the Dailies is terrible.  It just needs to be fixed period.  Lower cost or increase payout (would need about 120 play points for 4-0 and 3-1 to be similar to before given increased cost - or 3 boosters).  The change to the 2-man has similar implications as 8-man - it is good for people when booster prices drop to 3.5 or less.  Still seems a bit like a value grab from WOTC, but not as unreasonable as the daily changes.  Net expectations: increased demand for constructed since EV will be more stable.  Booster prices remain reasonable and make drafting more expensive.  EV for solid drafters is significantly higher, so cost increase borne by drafters with lower win percentages.  EV for constructed players doing 8-mans higher, though the very good grinders may have a harder time cashing out their value (pretty much the opposite of the very good drafters).  Dailies are either rectified by WOTC or die a slow death (a shame for everyone)."
magicTCG,3dyncw,moldar,7,Mon Jul 20 18:22:58 2015 UTC,"So they doubled the ticket price for dailies, but do the Play Points make up for it after the first one assuming you go 3-1 or better?"
magicTCG,3dyncw,gereffi,6,Mon Jul 20 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"The answer is no, you won't get double the prize payout."
magicTCG,3dyncw,TheSandTrap,3,Mon Jul 20 20:37:26 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Going 3-1 in a DE means getting 18 tix worth of Play Points plus ~10 tix worth of packs.  Unless you planned on entering one time and then never playing again, you'll enter another DE.  Instead of spending real tix, you now get to spend the Play Points.    Everyone complaining about untradable Play Points or prize payout not actually doubling along with the entry fee must be 4-0'ing DEs on a regular basis.  To those people, sorry, new system sucks.  I guess they'll just have to deal with going infinite at a slower pace, the poor things.  To all the other normal people who occasionally lose, this is good."
magicTCG,3dyncw,Zamite,2,Tue Jul 21 01:17:50 2015 UTC,This is a question i'd like to see answered.
magicTCG,3dyncw,sudonim87,2,Mon Jul 20 17:19:26 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that it won't come close to making up for it. That said, dailies were where all the value was at in the previous system so this can be viewed as 'fixing that'."
magicTCG,3dyncw,mozerdozer,6,Mon Jul 20 18:20:47 2015 UTC,"Here is a chart that lays out the difference, assuming all you care about is how many more DEs you can enter from the winnings of the previous one: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=9%28w-2%29%2F%285w-9%29%2C+w+from+0+to+1  Y axis is pack price (assumed to be the same in both payout schemes which it wouldnt be), X axis is win rate.  For the new system to benefit you, you must be UNDER the curve. So if you have a 90% win rate and pack prices are under 2.2 tickets, you're actually benefitting.  Of course, and this is the important part, if pack prices are above 2.25 tickets, which they almost always are, EVERY SINGLE PLAYER IS GETTING FUCKED.  If anyone wants to double check my math, this is the original equation I used: w4 * ( 8y/6 - 3) + 4w3(1-w)*(3y/4 - 1.5) < 0, 0 < y < 4, 0 < w < 1, which I arrived at by using Binomial Theorem than subtracting the new systems EV from the old systems EV (and grouping by exponents)."
magicTCG,3dyncw,fracguru,3,Mon Jul 20 21:04:25 2015 UTC,your assumption that the pack prices are the same both before and after the change is the fatal flaw.  The whole reason behind this change is the extremely low pack prices currently seen.

What this change will do is it will increase the pack prices which is good in terms of payout compared to current payout even after factoring the increased entry fee for Daily Events.   The downside of this change is not just the increased entry fee. To actually measure the impact of this change, we also have to consider the price of our decks. This is due to constructed we have to build our own decks which we invested tickets, whereas when you play sealed or draft, only the entry fee is the investment. What this change will do is since it will increase the pack prices, the average prices of all the cards will increase as well. That means even though it seems that we are getting better EV compared to the current prize structure, we are actually getting a lower return when factoring the cost of our decks."

magicTCG,3dyncw,Ephemerality314,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think I'm probably one of the few people happy about this change, because I have about 100 phantom points from playing the holiday cube a ton, and will get like 4 free drafts."
magicTCG,3dyncw,DromarX,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:52 2015 UTC,"These are pretty bad changes I think.  The problem with 2-man queues still isn't solved (you're still in the hole if you go 1-1 in two queues).    Dailies will almost assuredly pay out less than they do currently if we assume a baseline of packs being priced at 3 tickets currently (it can be more or less than that but let's just say they're around 3 usually).  Pack prices will go up since fewer are being paid out, however this is limited by the store which sells packs for $4 (aka 4 tickets).  So at best you pay 12 tickets entry fee and if you 3-1 you get back 3 packs (worth 12 tickets) and 180 Play Points (which WotC seem to value at 18 tickets i.e 10 PP = 1 ticket) so 30 ""tickets"".  Currently if we assume an average pack value of 3 tickets the payout is roughly 18 tickets for a 3-1 (however you only paid 6 tickets to enter).  So we're losing about 6 tickets per 3-1 in the best case scenario for the new system.  Another thing to also consider is that these Play Points have no value other than entering more events.  So now it will be much more difficult to play constructed events with the goal of grinding tickets to buy singles or decks."
magicTCG,3dyncw,phorgewerk,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"So math on the pack values aside, can someone explain to me how this doesn't outright kill the singles market? If tickets are gone and the new points system is untradeable, how are we supposed to get new singles other than getting lucky in packs? Really the only option I guess is trading packs for singles which is even more of a pain in the ass with fluctuating pack prices that are multiple dollars."

magicTCG,3dxapr,Ozy-dead,44,Mon Jul 20 14:04:47 2015 UTC,"Not easily, but over the last year I've managed it (somewhat). My girlfriend asked me to teach her to play, so we started with some of those 30 card freebie decks Wizards gave out with M15. She picked up the rules pretty quickly but didn't seem super into the game, so I didn't push it any further.   A month or two later, we were over at an old friend of mine's house and the subject of Magic came up. He had several EDH decks put together from his draft leftovers (He's a big limited player and he and his wife would build janky EDH decks to get some use out of the leftovers). So the four of us played with these super janky, inconsistent EDH decks and my girlfriend actually got into it, and even wound up winning (helped by my friend giving her some advice after being knocked out of the game).  I had never been super keen on EDH due to the less competitive nature of it, but I started to give it more attention since it was something my girlfriend enjoyed playing, and it was still Magic. I picked up some of the precons when they came out that year, and she took the Green one as her own and we took them back over to the same friends house and broke them in and before long, they became our regular playgroup.  It's taken some effort on my part to not make incredibly streamlined decks, and I intentionally include some suboptimal Johnny kind of cards in my builds to keep myself in check. But, I make the effort because I don't want to hamper her enjoyment of the game, and I don't want to start any sort of singles buying armrace with this group that's happened in the past. I did pick up a box of Origins that we're going to play a handful of matches of 2HG sealed with our friends with, and I'm sure we'll find something worth tossing into our decks from it.  The end result of all of this is that, over the last year, I've fallen out of the competitive side of Magic. There was a few week period around FRF that my girlfriend was working nights and I thought ""Hey, UB Control is in now, I'll buy back in and play for a few weeks."" There were enough LGSes running Standard that I could play 3 or 4 nights a week, and in 3 weeks, I wouldn't have trouble justifying the $200 it took me to buy back in. However, I only ever made it to 2 or 3 events, I just didn't have the drive anymore.  TL; DR - you can go back, but you need a strong reason to want to, and it's not easy"
magicTCG,3dxapr,zachtib,2,Mon Jul 20 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"My favorite thing to do is just not build decks and use my less experienced friends' decks.

Someone is unhappy with losing all the time, someone got some extra money they weren't expecting and they splurge on a few staples for their deck because they look fun, one person is really into deckbuilding and can't resist the temptation of refining their deck, etc. You can do your own banlist, but that requires everyone agreeing on a banlist. And even if everyone agrees on a banlist, that one dude who has a bunch of Officially Legal in EDH cards is not really going to be very satisfied that his friends are whining about his completely legal cards."

magicTCG,3dxapr,CausticRaven,3,Mon Jul 20 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"My group of commander players has become self regulating.  Anytime someone plays a card that we consider to be too degenerate for our group it becomes arch enemy until that player is eliminated.  Generally speaking that doesn't take long in a 4-6 player game, even with very disparate power levels.  After that happens a few times people tend to trim deck lists down to more reasonable levels of power.  The only time someone had a truly degenerate early turns combo kill of the table we all looked at each other, shrugged, and said 'ok, you win, time to play for second' and everyone else played for over an hour like that person just hadn't been at the game.  He cut that combo the next time he ran the deck so he didn't have to sit and watch us play half the night."
magicTCG,3dxapr,poesraven8628,5,Mon Jul 20 19:22:06 2015 UTC,I think the key lies in not using un-fun cards like deadeye navigator/prophet of kruphix etc.. Powerful cards are OK if thy are relatively fair such as avycn

magicTCG,3dxapr,diracnotation,7,Mon Jul 20 17:25:04 2015 UTC,"Generally, though, cards that give you more abilities, even if powerful, are less objectionable than cards that say your opponents can't do things.    Edric and Gaddock Teeg can both be powerful commanders, but while Edric does grant his controller a huge card advantage, he tends to result in wild swings and tons of play options for opponents.  Teeg, on the other hand, greatly reduces the ability of opponents to do the things they consider fun (playing the cards they brought in their decks).  Skew towards power, if you have to, but away from prevention if you want a less objectionable deck."
magicTCG,3dxapr,SpyglassSuperior,2,Mon Jul 20 18:22:15 2015 UTC,"But that is just a reworking of the counterspells are lame argument that has existed since the dawn of magic.   To make commander an unbroken format you would need a ban list the length of my arm.  People who play with mana denial and counters and lock pieces help keep the format from a state where ramp into dumb stuff and fast combo being the only 'real' decks.   I may think Sol Ring and Top are both objectionable cards to have in a 'casual' format, but I don't go around moaning if people are playing them."
magicTCG,3dxapr,diracnotation,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:47 2015 UTC,"If the 'prevention sucks' mindset has survived twenty years, we probably should stop trying to dismiss it.  And that's exactly what a fun playgroup does: when you play with people who are there to play just for fun, you don't need that banlist.  that's the fantastic part.  Your group can decide a certain commander, or planeswalker, or even type of spell is making the game less fun, and stop playing it.  My own playgroup phased out removal little by little, and it has been excellent for our games.  It requires trust that no one will abuse the lack of removal by running something like Vorinclex, but we all respect each others' wishes enough to keep that trust.  Now instead of dedicated lots of our decks to removal spells and counters, we can instead play the big bombs we came to a casual format to play, and it's glorious to be done with the days of   ""I play the thing""  ""I counter it.  I play the other thing""  ""I kill it""  And realizing that we just spent four cards and a full turn making sure nothing happened-- because that's awesome."

Designating a for-fun format is the only way to be sure you can build a janky deck and play it with people outside your playgroup.  People who want to play goofy, flavorful decks absolutely hate running into spiky decks and getting stomped:  the spike gets to enjoy making their machinery operate perfectly, but the casual player never gets to use his Quest for Ula's Temple to get tons of krakens in the sea monster deck.    Casual-exclusive players want a format where they know they can go to play just-for-fun decks and cards, and the intrusion of arms-races into a format like that wrecks it for them."

That's like doing an olympic fencing training regimen so you can slaughter people at a LARP event.

The trend started before Commander was a WoTC product sadly, but in the years I played it was never about ""winning as fast as you could"" and was generally frowned on.   It was a wonderful break between the PTQ grinding and almost weekly GPs. that is no longer the case, making EDH a serious format ruined the 'magic' of it. The magic that not every game is about winning, sometimes its good to just fuck around and enjoy the game.  Same thing could be said of Cube before it became a 'thing'."

League cards can only be traded for league cards. If people are willing to accept those rules (and bite the bullet of not trading away or selling their foil Nissas they happen to open because they're bound to the rules), I think that could be a pretty fun way to emulate newbie Magic.

magicTCG,3dxapr,thelastoneusaw,2,Mon Jul 20 17:48:45 2015 UTC,"The vast majority of the time you end up 3 color. You can draft a single guild, but due to how dense the list is with rares and mythics you usually end up want to splash a third color.  I would say as far as prevalence goes 3>2>4>5>1."

There's a catch though, between your deck and your sideboard you are not allowed to play more than 5 uncommons and no rares! Rarity is based on Gatherer information Lowest rarity counts, so if a card has been printed as a common and got reprinted as an uncommon, it still counts as a common for peasant. A few examples: Serendib Efreet is a rare, Mishra's Factory is an uncommon, and Exile is a common (because of Master's Edition I)"

Asked if they had a spare deck. They did not. Of course they did not, their ""deck"" was basically their whole collection. A monster pile of probably 500+ cards.  ""Don't you have to shuffle your 'deck' before playing?""   ""Are you crazy? If we do that, the colors are going to mix!""  Basically, their ""decks"" were layered by colors. So for instance, at the beginning, the guy would draw white spells and plains. Eventually, if the game lasted long enough, he might start drawing red spells and mountains. Once the game was over, they'd just pick their cards and throw them at the bottom of the pile (making sure to split the colors if they happened to overlap during a game) and play a new game."

As far as I can tell magic has ~5 different formats and I am worried I'll buy cards and then not be able to play because my cards don't match the format at X/Y/Z"
magicTCG,3dxapr,datgohan,44,Mon Jul 20 11:39:37 2015 UTC,"There are 3 major constructed formats in magic.   Standard which uses cards from the most recent sets  Modern Which uses cards starting from a specific set called 8th edition, and any printed after this set.   Legacy which uses cards dating back to the start of magic.   Each has their own ban list  (standard NORMALLY has no banlist) to keep things balanced or ""fair"", or to a certain speed of play. I.e. Modern in general is a turn 4 format, decks are balanced to not kill before turn 4 consistently. The banlist for legacy has many cards printed early on in magic when the developers of the game had no idea how to keep things balanced and fair, in another format called vintage, many of those cards are ""restricted"" (can only have 1 in your deck) and thus the cost of the format goes up exponentially.  The other constructed formats are Vintage and Commander.   Commander is a casual format, normally played with 4 players, that is really just played for fun and table politics usually determine the winner. Though there are some serious EDH decks out there, especially built for 1v1, its usually considered a purely casual format.   Vintage on the other hand is so expensive that many tournaments are unsanctioned and you may proxy the entire deck. This is actually mainly played online due to increased card availability. The paper versions of the cards are on the ""reserved"" list, which means they will never be printed ever again, thus why they are so expensive. Many of the cards in vintage format are thousands of dollars each.   Vintage is a format you should never worry about and to be honest, Legacy / Modern are very expensive as well, not on the level of vintage but still getting expensive. Standard, while the decks are cheaper, the cards arent legal forever and you have to replace them over time to keep up with the format.   This seems very complicated, but to be honest, Standard is the main one you will likely focus on as a newer player, if you would like some help in building a deck of cards that will be legal for quite a while going forward, just ask around. Someone likely has a near ""rotation proof"" list. The elves lists that are flying around are almost entirely made of cards that will be in standard for another ~15? months."
magicTCG,3dxapr,Awkward_Torkoal,14,Mon Jul 20 11:53:20 2015 UTC,"So it sounds like Modern and Standard are the ones to shoot for (as well as of course just casual).  I have a couple of starter sets but they are from a few years ago (dark ascension and avacyn restored) so probably out of the standard format. Even so those were Red/Green and Red/White decks and quite straight forward. I tend to prefer a more intricate playstyle with fancy spells so I've found myself more drawn to blue spells and some of the vampire monsters from black (because vampires...). Not sure if there is some kind of deck that can be built like that but it is what I would look into.  Thanks for explaining the formats by the way, definitely a bit strange to start with."
magicTCG,3dxapr,MTGCardFetcher,16,Mon Jul 20 12:16:49 2015 UTC,"Right now is an interesting time to get into standard. We will never again have this many sets in the standard format in the the future of magic unless they change the way sets are released. This is due to them changing ""blocks"" from 3 sets, to 2 sets, and removing the ""core set"" which comes out in between blocks. Instead, we will only have either 5 or 6 sets in standard at any given time, instead of right now we have EIGHT.   If I was going to invest in standard starting fresh, I would likely wait to drop major cash until this fall, as we have no idea what decks will be viable when many of the cards that are popular today rotate out.   As for a deck...  Not many vampires in standard right now but i can dig some lists up.   Well if you like tricky blue decks, there is a deck that is pretty straight forward and relatively cheap to build, but has many tricks and plays that blow your opponents out with, this is called White blue heroic.   http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=87881   the idea behind this one is to play a creature with the heroic mechanics, which means they get bigger each time you target them, and then protect that creature with spells that also happen to target them. This strategy is pretty linear and can get hated out by certain cards, but in general people are not very prepared for it. It also happens to be made up of mostly commons and uncommons and other than the land base, the rares are used in basically no other deck. This makes the deck much cheaper than most, if not any, competitive deck in the format. Sadly many of the cards will be rotating out of the format this fall.   If you want something more rotation proof, and happens to also be pretty cheap, Green/black elves is a new deck that just happen to have 90% of the cards printed in this most recent set. This one plays a ton of elves to the board, and hopes to drop a 3 mana elf that has the opponent lose 1 life per elf you control when he hits the board, and you play a lot of ways to search this guy out.   Theres one expensive card in the deck, Collected Company, which run about ~10-15 each, but will be a staple card in the format going forward and happens to be very very popular in modern right now as well. Definitely a solid investment.   Heres my current list for Green Black Elves: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/14-07-15-DvG-standard-elves/  The Nissa's could be replaced by Leaf Gilder and you would have a budget version. Chord of Calling could also be replaced to make it cheaper, though this is one of the expensive cards that IS rotating in the fall.   The control decks of the format with lots of counter spells and removal are much more expensive and are more geared toward an experience pilot and someone who understands the format as you have a lot of decisions to make on which spells you want to counter or which you can let resolve and handle once they are on the board. Its also a very punishing deck if you make mistakes."
magicTCG,3dxapr,datgohan,4,Mon Jul 20 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, loads of stuff.  The blue/white deck you've given there is really interesting. I like the draw mechanics from the blue cards; having more cards in hand generally means more options so I like that.  It sounds like there is going to be a new format soon (magic origins coming out soon I read?) so maybe I should wait and see what new blue cards come out. Then decide what to pair with blue; white looks nice and so does black."
magicTCG,3dxapr,Awkward_Torkoal,8,Mon Jul 20 13:01:12 2015 UTC,"Magic Origins is already out - that deck placed 2nd in yesterday's SCG Open tournament, without playing any Origins (or for that matter, Dragons of Tarkir) cards. It's easily the cheapest competitive blue deck in Standard, but the core engine rotates out of Standard in October.  If you don't mind spending a bit more, blue (alongside white, black, or both) makes a very strong control deck. Again, there are several key cards rotating out (notably [[Bile Blight]], [[Dissolve]], and [[Hero's Downfall]]), but we'll probably get replacements for those with Battle for Zendikar."

First of all, I'd proxy up a few decks that look interesting, so you can see if you enjoy their play style - there's nothing worse than spending a ton of money on a deck and finding you don't actually like playing it. There are a few different blue control decks right now, including pure blue/black control, Esper Dragons, and the new blue/white artifact control deck that placed 7th at the SCG Open. Try a few games with each, and see which you prefer. You could even see if anyone at your LGS has a deck you could borrow for testing and maybe FNM.  You could put together a version of the deck without spending a ton of money on cards that are rotating out. For example, still get the cheaper cards like [[Dissolve]] and [[Bile Blight]], but play [[Duress]] instead of the pricier [[Thoughtseize]]. There's no guarantee you'll get good replacements, but there's always a blue-based control deck in Standard, so the most you might have to do is switch your secondary colour.  I would personally proxy up a deck and take it for a test run before spending money, especially if you're a new player who might still be looking for their preferred play style."

magicTCG,3dxapr,chrisrazor,5,Mon Jul 20 12:48:32 2015 UTC,"To give an idea of pricing, typical tier 1 standard decks range from 200-400 dollars, tier 1 Modern decks 500-1500, Legacy 1500-4000, and Vintage 14,000+.

magicTCG,3dxapr,DrunkInDrublic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:23:18 2015 UTC,Yeah. I think it works nicely. Modern's power level is kept sane by the fact that cards have to be introduced via standard.
magicTCG,3dxapr,datgohan,2,Mon Jul 20 20:48:21 2015 UTC,"This is why I can't play Standard. When I played casually with my friends, no one cared about the cards you were using, and only when I started playing on Untap.in did I have to choose a specific format (now I see people actually playing casual but I didn't notice that before). I chose to play modern because to me it seems like having to change your deck every couple months and being forced to buy new cards, is not only a pain in the ass but also a pain in the wallet. Modern seems like the best to me. And honestly the differences between formats are sometimes lost on me. What's the difference between Legacy and Vintage? Only a ban list?"
magicTCG,3dxapr,DrunkInDrublic,2,Mon Jul 20 16:39:09 2015 UTC,Ban list is the difference between legacy and vintage. The 2 formats play vastly different due to this. Vintage also has a restricted list which means you can only play 1 of the card in your deck. This is unique to vintage
magicTCG,3dxapr,wcgaming,5,Mon Jul 20 20:22:35 2015 UTC,"If you plan on playing for a while, Modern will be less expensive than Standard.

magicTCG,3dxapr,Dracoplasm,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:27:46 2015 UTC,It changes about every 4 months but it doesn't rotate. Most cards banned stay banned etc... only small changes are made.  It seems to me in MTG that whole groups of cards are rotated out of the standard format at a time and then there is a banlist as well?
magicTCG,3dxapr,spook327,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"Most banned cards stay banned but by adding just 2 or 3 key cards every rotation they break the top decks to ensure that people buy the new builds. And since this happens every four months, you never play the same deck for long.   http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/standard-formats-magic-gathering  Standard uses the two most recent blocks and other than that there is no ban list. A deck in standard is good for 2 years. A standard mtg deck is cheaper than a competitive yugioh deck and is good for 2 years.  As other people have said, modern format magic plays similarly to competitive yugioh. It doesn't let you use cards from before the set 8th ed (Magic had a huge change in rules around this time so a lot of the older cards don't mesh as well/are broken as fuck) and it has a short ban list that very rarely changes. you can see the ban lists here, scroll to modern (also note that standard has no ban list). Modern decks are about the same price as a competitive yugioh deck but are good for multiple years.   http://magic.wizards.com/en/gameinfo/gameplay/formats/bannedrestricted  Legacy has no set restrictions and it has a pretty extensive ban list to accommodate. Legacy decks are a couple thousand dollars due to the fact that all the best cards will never get reprinted.   Vintage removes the legacy ban list. These decks are 10s of thousands of dollars.   Every time a new set is released, all new cards are immediately included in all of these formats, but the new cards are designed with standard and modern in mind. As a result it's very rare for the modern format to have to adjust the ban list. When a card slips into standard that is too powerful due to poor design, wizards issues an apology and an explanation for the banning. This last happened in 2011 and the time before that 2005  http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/148   http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/arcana/brief-history-standard-banned-list-2015-07-13  The last thing to note is that sometimes wizards will reprint a card that hasn't been reprinted since before 8th ed which means a new card for modern and standard and more supply for legacy. An example of this just recently is Goblin Piledriver  Goblin Piledriver has been a key card in legacy goblin decks for years, being the wincon in almost all tournement goblin decks. His introduction to modern will result in a spike in modern goblin popularity but they will not be as powerful as they are in legacy due to the fact that cards like Goblin Ringleader and Goblin matron are still not available in modern. Wizards has already put a lot of thought and testing behind the decision to reprint such an old card and its impact on these formats.   Finally, if you are unsure if a certain card is legal in a certain format, you can look the card up on Gatherer and click the link Sets and Legality."

magicTCG,3dxapr,justhereforhides,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:55 2015 UTC,"Modern can be a lot of fun, and you can get started relatively cheaply if you don't expect to be super competitive.  I started with standard, played for a little while, then moved into modern with a $10 infect deck.  I slowly bought more and better cards for it and that infect deck is now in the $300-400 range.  I personally don't enjoy the tournament play very much so I mostly play EDH (also known as commander).  EDH is a tough format to start in without knowing a bit of magic first, but I think it's a lot of fun.  The biggest issue with EDH in my opinion is that you really should have 2-3 decks minimum.  In the other formats it's all winning all the time so you can get away with only having one deck, but in EDH the play styles vary a lot so I like to have one super competitive deck, one really hilariously underpowered deck just for fun, and one deck kinda in the middle to play most of the time.  Seeing what your local people are playing is really your best bet.  If you do decide to get into EDH the starter decks that wizards releases are a great place to get going."

I can't really suggest that you get into anything but limited or standard as a new players though. Where I play modern at, everyone is really good and new players get their butts kicked and tend to get frustrated. Standard seems to have a lot more people playing in the tournaments along with people who are just learning to play the game. Seems like a good place to start.  I suggest starting with limited. It will teach you how to build a deck that works, and increase your collection at the same time. Good luck on your magical journey!"

Worse still is that this often leads to them believe I've ""scummed"" them in some way. If you want to get better it's important to adhere to the rules of the game."
magicTCG,3e107g,SO_MANY_TAPIRS,11,Tue Jul 21 05:04:27 2015 UTC,"I think leniency is great up to a point. It helps people to think through more lines of play. The last time I did a 'take back' (with opponents permission) was about a year ago at a Grand Prix. I forgot about a mutavault activation or two as blockers, and I made a suboptimal block that was going to result in my loss, and being knocked out of contention for day 2. Stressed, i said ""I can't believe I forgot that. I'm going to lose."" and he's like   ""No problem man, you can take it back and block with the mutavaults."" Then I was in an awkward spot. I had some combat tricks and answers in hand which virtually gave me a win knocking him out of contention for day 2. I eventually said  ""No, I can't take it back because then I might win and I don't want to win like that."" And he further insisted that I take it back and that he wanted a fair match. So I did take it back, blew out his attackers and swung on my turn for the win... Only to be shocked he had the perfect hand of answers and tricks. It was then why I knew he let me take it back and was so insistent about it. There was literally no combination of blocks or attacks I could have done to win the game. He had every answer and more. It only felt like I was in a good position. It was probably the best I ever felt about being knocked out of day 2 contention."

What if you were playing Mario Kart and they slid off the track? Missing shots and making mistakes is just as big of a part of any game as making shots or great plays. The thing that makes Magic different is how easy it is to let people back up and rewind the game state. That doesn't mean we should. It doesn't make anyone a better player, doesn't make the game more fun and is just as likely to result in butthurt as when you don't allow it. Of course if you're teaching a brand new player it's different, but even at prerelease I prefer to just let the chips fall where they may. This applies to me as well of course, i.e. I don't typically ask for takebacks."

No, there is no game zone called 'the mana zone' that is distinct from the battlefield and I don't care what the fuck your playmat says about it.   Mana 'weaving/shuffling' is not legal.

Yeah you should probably shuffle after they do as well. I mean if they are 'weaving' lands in between spells relative to CMC and colour then I think a lot of people would have an issue. But, the same problem can be found when scooping up 14 lands (after a long game) in a pile and shuffling them back into the deck. When I begin to shuffle my deck I have information about the relative positioning of cards in the deck. (14 lands in a pile)  How do we fix this? Do you suggest a face down pile shuffle?"
magicTCG,3e107g,MTG_Kokey,6,Tue Jul 21 05:15:27 2015 UTC,This is why you shuffle a lot to randomize your deck. A 14 land pile poorly shuffled into a deck is just as not random as an intentional even distribution of lands and spells. One just sucks more.

My opponent plays a flash creature ""during declare blockers step"" then tries to hold priority and declare it as a blocker to dodge an obvious on-board answer.  Reality: if a player wants to flash in a creature to block with (or create a token or something) it needs to happen at the end of the attack step. That is a time in which a player can use priority. However, if the defending player does this, priority passes back to the attacker for responses.  When the declare blockers step actually begins, the only thing the defending player can do us declare his/her blockers. The player can't cast anything or use activated abilities until after blockers are declared.  Tldr: that a player can't flash in a creature and declare it as a blocker using priority.

I think it's a universal, frankly. Every hobby I've ever been a part of considers themselves martyrs because they spend sooooo much on it. Neopets players whine about paying for cute outfits for their pets, and Lego fans complain about spending several hundred dollars on a few kits. You're not special, get over yourselves.

magicTCG,3e107g,DankMemeYo,14,Tue Jul 21 15:00:52 2015 UTC,"Players complaining about the cost of the game has become really grating to me. -WOTC doesn't control the secondary market. -WOTC does not owe you a Tier 1 modern deck for 20$. -Modern Masters was not created to reduce the price of staples. -If you don't like the price of Snapcasters, or Liliana, or Tarmogoyf, then don't play a deck with them in it. Brews can be competitive too. -You can play competitive Magic at nearly any price point. Just because the Tier 1 Modern deck you want to play costs a grand doesn't mean you can't play in tournaments."
magicTCG,3e107g,stravant,29,Tue Jul 21 03:48:24 2015 UTC,"-WOTC doesn't control the secondary market.   Not sure what you're referring to there. They don't directly control it, but through their actions as a company they sure do have a lot of indirect control over card supply and thus prices."
magicTCG,3e107g,DankMemeYo,2,Tue Jul 21 05:06:56 2015 UTC,"I mean that the prices on the secondary market are what players are willing to pay, not because WOTC wants Snaps to be 80$. Many people lose sight of the fact that in the eyes of WOTC, Tree of Redemption cost the same to print as Liliana of the Veil, and they were printed with the same rarity and put into products that players could buy from the company. By buying the products that actually make WOTC money, players all have an equal chance to open a card from a booster. Sure, they push certain cards in an attempt to sell sets, but even they are not able to predict what the secondary market will do, and what cards will demand what prices. WOTC has no mechanism to react quickly to secondary card market prices, nor should they suddenly announce reprints of every card that spikes. It would destroy consumer confidence. Just look at Chronicles. Just ask Yu Gi Oh players how it feels to spend hundreds on cards only to see them reprinted in a 15$ precon deck a few months later."
magicTCG,3e107g,Esc77,6,Tue Jul 21 05:26:19 2015 UTC,"The value of magic cards are kept stable and high by the promise of no mass reprints.  Magic cards don't depreciate in value with resale.  They are relatively liquid.  And you know that, on the whole, massive reprints are just not a thing that is incoming.  When you buy a Liliana for 80$ part of the reason that price is so high is because you could turn around and resell it tomorrow without losing a lot of value.  You also know you can hold it for many months and not lose value.  In fact you will probably gain value.  The liquidity and appreciation of Magic cards are benefits.  You can cash out on a modern deck and build a new modern deck with the value.  Most players don't utilize the whole value of their collection; they focus on a small portion of it.  Magic is insanely expensive if you go from zero to Legacy tomorrow.  But the game has natural stepping stones and progressions that allow you to amass card value and use it."
magicTCG,3e107g,DankMemeYo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:58:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed. We should also not forget that Innistrad was in Standard only a few years ago.

It would destroy consumer confidence.   That's true, but... it is clear that they're okay with Tarmogoyf being a $100+ card for instance. They've had plenty of time to do something about it if they thought otherwise.  They almost certainly do have some internal statistics quantitatively looking at the secondary market prices and how they are likely to be effected based on their actions."
magicTCG,3e107g,DankMemeYo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:49:44 2015 UTC,"Part of the reason they are okay with Tarmogoyf being a 100$ card is because it was a 100$ card for years, and many people purchased them for 100$. They don't want to drive the price of the card into the ground and make those players lose confidence in the money they spend on the game.  But ultimately that 100$ price tag is because players are paying it."

magicTCG,3e107g,DankMemeYo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:19:35 2015 UTC,"Modern Masters was created to increase the availability of Modern Staples, not to drop the prices on most staples. You can see this firsthand as the price of Goyf has only increased since MM1 was printed. Part of the reason Modern was created was because Legacy was the only non-rotating format, and it has a near-finite player pool due to the reserved list. Furthermore, WOTC essentially makes no money from players buying into Legacy since the vast majority of competitive cards have been removed from their boosters long ago.     However, with the creation of Modern, Wizards can now actually reprint format staples while still receiving a cut of the profits. It is still in their best interest to protect the value of players' collections though, which is partially why we see the high MSRP of MM packs and why cards like Goyf are still Mythic.    While availability and price are linked, they are NOT the same thing. Before MM1 came out, I hardly knew any players with Goyfs, and I couldn't have traded for one at my LGS if I wanted to. Now it seems like half the players at the store have a Goyf, and I know that if I want to play the lottery there are still plenty of MM2 packs on the shelf."

magicTCG,3e107g,Love_Bulletz,7,Tue Jul 21 13:41:17 2015 UTC,"Because it's possible for the combo to literally never happen. You're drawing a random number of cards until you either hit the right combo or hit Emrakul. It's theoretically possible to hit Emrakul before you hit the combo a thousand times. That doesn't happen, but it does frequently take an unreasonable amount of time. You can't shortcut it because it isn't guaranteed to happen."

magicTCG,3e107g,DancingC0w,2,Tue Jul 21 15:03:50 2015 UTC,"They're separate effects.  When Fiend Hunter (or Oblivion Ring, or Detention Sphere) enters the battlefield, the exile effect is put on the stack.    If you remove fiend hunter while his ability is still on the stack, the second ability will trigger and be placed on top of the exile.  So your stack now has a ""Return Creature"" on top of ""Exile Creature"".  The return won't be able to bring anything back when it resolves, then the exile effect will happen and the duder is now exiled for good.  Banishing Light and Banisher Priest are the fixed versions of these, since the effects are linked in their text."

A new player drops $1.8k on Goyfs and Lilianas and the works and then gets pissed the first match they lose. These cards are put on such a pedestal to them at first. They find out that Goyf dies to a bunch of dumb shit and Liliana doesn't actually win you the game (except when she does, kek).  Players forget that when you're buying into a GBx midrange deck in Modern, you're buying into a 50/50 matchup against many decks, and a few terrible matchups (hi Tron).  Another pet peeve is when new players brew some off the wall but expensive concept and then become upset when it doesn't work. I have an acquaintance that recently put together a BUG Loam list for Modern - an admirable pursuit, but it's essentially his first time playing competitively. No concept of tempo, no concept of trading, but trying to jam 4x Smallpox in Modern against all odds. He's all pissed that his Snapcasters and Lilianas and Damnations aren't carrying him to victory each game, turns out you have to know how to play Loam for it to be good."

magicTCG,3e107g,rimbs,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:58 2015 UTC,"That's a great question rifter5000. I took the signets out because they lead to the only viable decks being upheaval/big mana decks and mono red aggro. Any other strategy just wasn't good enough to compete and it didn't feel healthy for midrange to not exist in any competitive sense.  Giving any color greens ramp also made green less necessary in the big mana decks, most of the big mana decks being drafted didn't play green at all which feels wrong. once I took the signets out and replaced them with worse mana rocks(prismatic lens, for example) ramp decks went back to being base green. It also didn't remove big mana artifact decks from the cube, it just made them a bit more fair.  Another issue came from the fact that in order to balance out all of the artifact mana decks I had to put in a lot of destroy target artifact effects and the entire cube felt even more two sided than before.  I drafted my cube with the signets about 20 times and almost every time either the upheaval signet deck won the draft or the mono red deck won. And the rest of the decks just didn't seem anywhere near as good when compared to the two pillars. Once I took the signets out the meta became so much more balanced, in a given draft there would almost always be a combo deck, a control deck or two, a ramp deck, a midrange deck, reanimator, and while not all of the decks had favorable matchups against each other the environment as a whole felt a lot healthier. At the end of the day this is also a personal opinion, if you are a cube owner who wants the upheaval decks to be the best or whatever, then by all means, add the signets. But that isn't what I want from my cube so I got rid of them. And I'm tired of two of my friends begging for signets so I can let storm back in the cube >__>"

I play Niv, designed without the obvious broken combos like [[curiosity]] or [[basilisk collar]], and designed such that I don't actually need Niv out to combo out.   I spend most games getting people new hands if anyone is bemoaning being dragged down by theirs, or any one person lets it be known that their hand is a bit too good, and otherwise acting as the disproportionate-amount-of-pain-sent-in-an-arbitrary-direction police, making sure to counter or kill things if someone decides to abruptly combo out just to kill one random person or some such thing.   And I run enough redundancies that, with a couple of turns of warning, I can consistently get my board and hand state up to ""Poised to kill everyone"" as the late game starts heading in that direction."

Hermit druid is nearly unbeatable, but played so rarely because its a casual format. Even when I bring my narset deck to GP pod and win on turn 3/4 people get mad and act like I did something wrong. When you play affinity in modern people recognize you're trying to win and accept it. In EDH people believe you're doing somethign wrong when you don't play a deck that allows them to live long enough to cast their fun expensive spell. Thats a sure sign that its a casual format. Don't delude yourself into thinking its not."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,Ianb219,6,Tue Jul 21 02:35:35 2015 UTC,"As a Johnny/Spike, I find the majority attitude toward EDH frustrating and unproductive.  My own flagship EDH deck is a Jhoira mass permanent removal plus Eldrazi combo. The counter to this deck isn't to say ""Don't use that deck, it's too good."" We're not making ourselves better players by limiting our opponents. We take what beats us as a challenge—this is how we grow over time. Removing that element stagnates the metagame, and cripple our growth as players.  Of course this doesn't mean that I should go around crushing newer players with some form of unstoppable uber-deck. If a player isn't at a point where they can look at what beat them and incorporate it into their overall strategy, then there's an excellent reason to play ""nicer"" decks.  But the demand that no one play a strategy with fangs is infuriating when made by perfectly capable, enfranchised players. Doubly so when made by players whose budget is clearly in the thousands. Perhaps it's the black streak in my color pie that makes it so enjoyable to not limit myself to fit their whims.   Now, I'm not talking about being an intentional jerk ""for the lulz"". Rather, it's not playing to the naive expectation that just because we sat down with 100 cards instead of 60, there are things that are off limits. Having 100 cards in your starting library doesn't mean your opponent can't or shouldn't play counterspells, land destruction, or board wipes.   That we still see this expectation of ""Combo is okay, but playing too many policing cards makes you a bad person"" makes me believe there's far too much coddling in the format, and it's half the reason why we end up with five hour games that everyone is sick of playing (Yeah, your experience might be that five hour games are great, but the drawn faces and sullen eyes I've seen at the table after hour two aren't phantoms either).  Yes, let's play for fun. Yes, let's make sure everyone knows when we're playing our ""serious"" decks as opposed to just our fun ones. But let's also play to win, and play to be better players. My suggestion to the original poster is that if others can't interact with your deck early enough to survive (especially in multiplayer), it's a call for them to rebuild their decks to be more interactive, not for you to dumb yours down."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,CapnWracker,23,Tue Jul 21 01:00:15 2015 UTC,"The problem with your logic is that if you pack such a deck in a multiplayer game, the other players have no choice but to kill you immediately. The while point was to have a game for 4 people. Not 1 or 3  I’ve built a degenerate Maelstrom deck. Its not hard to win t2-t3 through counters and hate. Its fun the first 2-3 times, then it gets old."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,sageco,2,Tue Jul 21 01:39:06 2015 UTC,"Actually, I've always wanted to build a degenerate Maelstrom deck, myself. Any chance you could PM me the list? No problem if you'd like to keep your tech to yourself though.  And...I honestly would rather be hated out of the game quick than sit through the World of Value I see going on in so many games—that dreaded situation where everything is done ""for value"", but nobody does anything to win, and games feel more like a test of endurance than skill. I actually made a deck to poke fun at that play-style. The commander is Oloro, and the deck contains nothing but removal, counterspells, board wipes, and card draw (plus felidar Sovereign). Nothing points out the absurdity of the value gameplan quite like it! What's even more fun is that I built the Oloro deck to intentionally fold to anyone with a sufficiently aggressive gameplan, yet its winrate is hilariously high."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,CapnWracker,10,Tue Jul 21 02:10:22 2015 UTC,"The point of EDH is to play how you want to play it. If you want to have a playgroup of a bunch of likeminded individuals who want to play super competetively, then go for it. Am I going to force my playgroup to play around my deck, and get hated out? Probably not. If that's what your playgroup wants to do, then go for it. You have to find the right people for the right strategy. But if you play competetively against people who want to play casually, you're going to get kicked out. Play how you want to play, but don't make it unfun for others."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,jayceiscute,5,Tue Jul 21 03:05:52 2015 UTC,"But this is a good point you bring up. At my EDH playgroup there is one person who always brings out a really busty deck (edric), but complains every time we kill him in the first few turns. But when we don't...he just takes like 4 extra turns to instantly win the game while having counterspells up every time against our threats. It's fair enough if you bring a very good deck, but like you say, if you do you shouldn't complain about being focused down.  I don't personally mind if someone brings a good deck, but do indeed keep in mind that even if some players do have the money to upgrade their deck, there might be other reasons why they don't. I have a non-combo sharuum deck, all my decks always have new-framed cards. If a card doesn't exist in a new frame then I won't play it, while many other people in my group play older and more broken cards."

Some people only have fun if they win, others (like myself) don't care about winning every game and play to have whacky shit happening and making interesting plays or decisions.   My suggestion to the original poster is that if others can't interact with your deck early enough to survive (especially in multiplayer), it's a call for them to rebuild their decks to be more interactive, not for you to dumb yours down.   I very much disagree with this statement. Just because you throw hundreds of dollars at the game doesn't mean others should do that too. It's a social game. Respect that others have less money or don't want to spend more money on the game. I, for one, am not gonna replace the underpowered yet fun interactions my deck provides just to deal with your 30+ dollar cards. I'd rather lose than boring my deck down this way."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,xCPAIN,2,Tue Jul 21 11:44:07 2015 UTC,"That's regular highlander. A competitive format that uses big, yet highly efficient and reliable decks. EDH is where you play big dumb stuff because it's the only place you get to play big dumb stuff.  The problem with competetive EDH is that it's utterly annoying to play. Since it's next to impossible to beat multiple opponents all playing competetive decks quickly, the default strategy becomes stopping everyone from doing anything. It's like playing a Soul Sisters mirror, only you need to go through a lot more cards before people deck them selves."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,neohellpoet,2,Tue Jul 21 10:53:36 2015 UTC,"I agree. The social environment matters a lot, and the environment in this case is your LGS.   If you can convince your LGS to run a $5 a week EDH tournament, you are bound to attract better competition, however, there is also a chance of some people entering for fun and losing badly. However if you and your play group are determined to make the scene competitive, you need to force those people to either not enter or to get better. From experience, as long as you are nice about it and not an ass then people will try to get better.   Don't confuse competitive with cutthroat though. We usually get in 2 games of EDH when we play which allows us to play really good decks for the first game and slightly less powerful decks the second time. It is not only an attempt to allow the people slightly worse to win, but also to try out other decks and generals."

Then you get to do stuff like fact or fiction targeting one of the other players so they give you a pile to deal with the other player"
magicTCG,3dz9a5,Hiredgoonthug,7,Tue Jul 21 01:19:07 2015 UTC,"There isn't a stigma against those because it's mostly 1 for 1 spot removal (and board wipes).  Strip Mine is usually the best way to deal with a Cabal Coffers that is about to run rampant, Counter spell is just the best way to deal with any big problematic spell, like Primal Surge.  Board wipes are the only way to deal with  token strategies which are extremely common.   The reason there's a stigma against MLD/stax is because you end up tuning your deck around fast mana rocks to power through the taxing or the lack of lands.  This cuts everyone else off from playing Magic, which is generally not fun."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,ljackstar,30,Tue Jul 21 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"The thing with Commander is that there's no real default power level or expectations; the format is what you make it. Some groups prefer to play long casual games with their favorite legends. Other groups play it as 99-card Legacy. Neither group is playing it wrong, they just have different ideas of what fun is. My advice is to find people who want to play the same way you do. Or you can try to join a more casual group and give yourself restrictions like no infinite combos or no tutors. This will make your decks less oppressive and consistent without forcing you to make worse plays.  But if you're playing in an EDH tournament, you should do everything within the restrictions of the tournament to maximize your chances of winning."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,Enderkr,21,Tue Jul 21 00:34:02 2015 UTC,"Depends on the playgroup, to be honest.  For a lot of people, EDH is the format where cards that can't be played in other formats due to cost, etc can be played. There are certainly groups out there that play to win and play competitively.  If you want to play with the people at the particular group at your LGS, maybe put constraints on yourself.  Build a deck that just tries to win in a particularly roundabout way (Helix Pinnacle?) or provide some deckbuilding restriction that prevents you from using cards that appear in the Legacy and Modern Top 8s at GPs."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,Aerim,21,Mon Jul 20 19:08:01 2015 UTC,"At the core of EDH is a group of people who are (1) trying to have a fun time by (2) playing a game. As such, you should avoid building decks that negatively impact the group's ability to do either of those things. The first is more subjective, and is, unfortunately, something that varies wildly based on the attitudes of the playgroup, but the second point is something that you can easily build around.  Broadly, players want to play a game that (a) had play, and (b) they could cast their spells. Point (a), again, is very broad and differs by playgroup, but generally means a game that had some degree of back-and-forth, some degree of interactivity, and generally leaves all the players feeling that they could have won if they had done X and Y differently. What this means for deckbuilding is to avoid consistent fast combo. Dying to Sharuum + Gravestorm on T5 is very different to dying to that same combo T15. Now, some playgroups are okay with games reliably ending T5-7, but most groups you find will frown on that kind of behavior.  Point (b) is very simple to work around - avoid effects that lock people out of the game! The group came together to play a game, and sitting around under a Stasis lock while one person slowly kills everyone doesn't feel a lot like playing a game. Even worse if the Stasis player doesn't have a kill on the table, and the rest of the table is watching him durdle until he gets it together.   Keep in mind, however, that some groups are totally okay with this kind of environment. There are incredibly cutthroat playgroups that thrive on these kinds of games, and if your group is one of them, then feel free to ignore the wordwalls above.   Now that the more hard-and-fast rules are out of the way, we move to the more nebulous problem of ""fun"". This varies wildly from playgroup to playgroup, what subset of cards and strategies are fun or unfun, and is usually very arbitrary. There's no good rules to determine whether a card will create negative fun in a vacuum, so the best advice I can give here is to try to match the group's average level of card quality. If you know you won't have fun playing at that level of card quality, then you should consider finding another playgroup if possible.  Anyway, that's a very lengthy post detailing my thoughts on what casual play means, and how to adjust your deckbuilding to that approach.   tl;dr Casual play is all about creating a fun group experience, so avoiding obviously unfun strategies (prison/stax/fast combo) and knowing your group's nuances is key to coming in with the right deck."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,lieronet,40,Mon Jul 20 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with playing to win at EDH, the only problem is HOW you win. In general if your deck is too good then take out pieces that make it really consistent such as the tutors. It's also a good idea to take out things that people consider unfun like the Stasis you have in there.   For example I have a Melek EDH deck that's alright but it would really be pushed over the edge if I added things to it that would allow me to take multiple turns like [[Time Warp]] or [[Time Stretch]]. It would be possible for me take to take upwards to ten extra turns without anyone else being able to do anything, but no one wants to sit down and watch me play with myself for upwards of ten minutes while I grab combo pieces and use them.  Or you can find a playgroup that is also looking for very competitive EDh decks to go against."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,undershot1,28,Mon Jul 20 19:13:40 2015 UTC,"To add to this: it definitely depends on the group, but some things that many EDH groups frown upon are:  Taking super long turns  Tutoring a lot (searching and shuffling an EDH decks takes awhile)  Land denial strategies (no one likes not being able to play the game)  Combo wins (again, people like to get to play the game)"
magicTCG,3dz9a5,towishimp,21,Mon Jul 20 19:37:39 2015 UTC,"searching and shuffling an EDH decks takes awhile   Also, for many people the fun part of EDH is that your deck rarely plays the same way twice, since you get different singletons each game.  By tutoring repeatedly, you're removing the chaotic nature of the format (which is kinda core) and turning it into just another ""whose deck is the better well-oiled machine""."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,mxzf,7,Mon Jul 20 20:26:48 2015 UTC,Is this significantly different than playing a strategy that has redundant effects across different cards though? Not all strategies have that advantage so it seems like they would be unfairly consistent without other strategies using tutors.
magicTCG,3dz9a5,jonkoeson,5,Mon Jul 20 21:22:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, kinda.  But having multiple similar effects still isn't the same as tutoring any effect you need at the moment.  It's a bit of a gray area where it does help consistency, but it doesn't feel as un-fun as someone tutoring a card."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,mxzf,5,Mon Jul 20 21:35:39 2015 UTC,"I think there's a line, but if you want to make a mishra deck, or a phage deck, or a lich deck you need to be able to tutor the pieces that make it function, it isn't so you win it's just so your deck can do what it does."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,jonkoeson,3,Mon Jul 20 21:41:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, and I don't really have an issue with stuff like that, where there are only half a dozen cards in all of Magic that can even do what you simply must have to cast your commander (or something like that).

Play whatever you want but dont be surprised if the infect, token and prossh guys all try to kill you first.   If your deck makes you act like a dick people will get mad at you and kill you first especially after the first game. You may win with that deck once but as soon as people know what your doing they will just kill you first every time. EDH is a self correcting format because the meta is very social.

Level 10 can be pimp to the max, Level 1 can be 60 Craw Wurm variants and 40 land. When you approach a play group ask: On a scale from 1 to 10 how good are your decks? and play appropriately.   2) After a great deal of discussion and thought on the matter, a large majority of EDH players tend to be having fun when they are allowed to develop their board, and do things. Creatures have to be allowed to enter play, and should be allowed to attack. - Destroying all lands prevents creatures from being cast - Ensnaring bridge prevents them from attacking - Countering every spell prevents boards from advancing. When having fun, it is acceptable to lose if your opponent plays better creatures than you or plays more synergistic creatures than you. Therefore, I might recommend playing a light removal package for key threats but primarily focusing on ramping and playing strong/highly synergistic cards.   TLDR: Your opponent's won't attack you because you have strongest creatures on board = fun, your opponent's cannot attack you because Stasis, ensnaring bridge, armageddon (therefore they cannot even cast guys in the first place) =  unfun."

I would work around this by trying to maximize the fun of a deck, but I always ended up with either a gimmick, or a cutthroat, tutoring, friend killer. I could never end up with a classic EDH deck, goofy midrange.  The second issue was that while I knew people who played EDH, I could never convince my closets MTG friends to construct EDH decks. I wasn't happy with my deck building, and I was never playing against my favorite opponents. All I really wanted was a format with powerful cards and unique interactions. That sounds like EDH, but after a while I realized that wasn't for me.  Eventually I made a cube, and I've never been happier with Magic. It solved my deck building issue, cube is competitive so there's no shame in min maxing. It also let me play with my normal playgroup, since no one needs to bring a pre-constructed deck.

magicTCG,3dz9a5,-33rpm,3,Tue Jul 21 02:06:46 2015 UTC,"I think the way to avoid being ""that guy"" is to remember there are probably 3 other people playing with you, and you are all, collectively, responsible for having a good evening (or morning, or whatever) as a group. You wouldn't sit there reeling off racist jokes and insulting your opponents mothers, and in the same way when you play your deck there's an element of playing it in a way that facilitates everyone at the table having a good time. Obviously build it to win, and play to win, but primarily play for the good of the group. In the same way it's good not to win every time, if you play with the same people. Since there are no prizes on the line, what does it matter if a player at an EDH table loses? If the way that you have fun winning is explicitly at the cost of everyone else in the group, then perhaps a multiplayer social format isn't the format for you?  I mean I might be wrong, but I see a game of EDH, first and foremost, as something that facilitates time well spent for the group of people playing, and after that a competition. That makes it highly dependent on the group - /u/CapnWracker earlier in the thread plays in a group where each player has an expectation of stiff competition, and mutual improvement over time, whereas /u/branewalker plays in a group where style in play and deck construction is valued over victory and efficiency. Neither of these people are wrong - they just experience the format differently, and highlight the absurdity of trying to generalise the right or wrong way to play a format that exists, primarily, as a social interaction between a regular playgroup rather than an organised competitive structure."

The second half is important. If you're not winning in style, you're not doing it right.    The big question you're left with after all that is, ""what is style?""  Well, first look at all the easy, resilient ways to win. Cross those off the list. Then look at most ""oops, I win"" two-card combos. Cross those off, too. Finally, look at ways to win that involve huge resource discrepancies (massive early ramp, resource denial, and repeated extra turns, including pseudo extra-turn effects like Prophet of Kruphix). Cross those all of the list.  Don't do that shit, people aren't here to battle for the quickest win. Part of the fun of EDH is watching people do weird shit.  One way to do weird shit and also compete with decks that people like you bring to the table is to include a lot of ways to copy and steal shit. Even as far as jank like Stolen Goods. Let me tell you, when Stolen Goods flips a Copy Enchantment while its owner controls Necropotence...that's awesome.  When you're being attacked by a Blightsteel Colossus, anyone can cast Swords or Path or Wing Shards (under-appreciated EDH gem), but the guy that casts [[Reflect Damage]] is a real hero.

Commander isn't intended for everyone, and it looks like you've made the logical choice of looking at the format, deciding that it's not a match for you and moving on to things you do find fun. That's healthy and exactly what should happen."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,MoleculesandPhotons,8,Mon Jul 20 20:59:42 2015 UTC,"I did not downvote, but perhaps I did get a little salty at ""actual games of magic..."" This is a diverse game with a multitude of play styles available to help everyone find something they like. The post is somewhat condescending with referring to competitive play as ""actual games..."" Just my friendly $0.02  That being said, thank you for pointing this out, as it is something we should all keep in mind more often."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,PricklyPricklyPear,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:51:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. If I'm gonna get hate for playing a legal card / strategy, let's just ban it and move on. I've never understood having cards like Sol Ring be legal and then complaining when someone beats you with a turn 1 sol ring into a combo or whatever. A game where it's rude to win makes my brain hurt. Seems like tabletop RPGs are a better venue for creativity and group flavorful fun than magic, but hey, to each his own. I'll be playing limited or modern instead."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,CatsOP,2,Mon Jul 20 21:52:25 2015 UTC,"I think that every Magic format isn't fun if you play Tier1 decks. They just run too perfect and you always get to win the same way.  Of course there are people who like that, so we are back to the point of X likes it, Y doesn't."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,tetsuooooooooooo,2,Tue Jul 21 08:15:38 2015 UTC,"You can totally play to win. Just don't build a deck goes off on turn 2, because then you don't quite understand the purpose of EDH, which is long, convoluted games. If you do want to just play 99-card legacy, then you can always play duel commander."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,MarkZwei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:22:46 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of who you enjoy playing with; are you willing to find people who share your mentality to play with? Or, do you enjoy the people at that LGS to the point where you want to build a less competitive deck?  I've been on both ends of the spectrum. I like EDH because I can do dumb things that I can't in other formats. Big enchantments/creatures can be a thing. At my LGS it's rather cutthroat between Azami, Prossh, Bruna...etc. While I liked playing with friends at the kitchen table, I did want to play at the LGS too. So I built a deck to play there too."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,montanaflash23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:18:26 2015 UTC,"If you can, build different decks for different groups.  There is one guy I play EDH with, builds very competitive decks, so I have a Captain Sisay deck for him.  Then another group I play against, I use a different, much less competitive deck that is meant to be more entertaining than challenging.  But then again that's how I do all my decks.  I've got my serious couple designed to be competitive and the rest to be entertaining or to try fun ideas.  Good luck and have fun with EDH, it really is fun if you can find different groups at different power levels."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,Tehdougler,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:39:28 2015 UTC,"My EDH deck is very combo-centric (it is a Vorel of the Hull Clade deck), and the only reason I even made an EDH deck is because I wanted to play a format where I could viably do broken stuff with Vorel.  I often find that when I am playing it in a tournament, noody bats an eye when I drop a Darksteel reactor and go off using untap/tap effects to combo it up to 20 counters with Vorel in the next few turns, or if I just lock my opponent out of the game by looping my turns with Magistrate's Scepter. I have noticed though, that in a more casual setting, the people I play against don't really like this type of strategy.   I don't think that my deck is even very competitive, but it's the nature of the deck that some people don't want to play against in a casual setting.   I ended up making a ""transformation board"" so that when I want to play a more casual game I can swap out a lot of my combo elements with replacements that include a lot of big hydas with (X) casting costs and other mana sinks that make big creatures or flashy effects instead of combo wins."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,kodemage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:04 2015 UTC,"When you play, play to win. When you build your deck maybe try and match your power level to your friends power level. At a tournament at a store play and build as cutthroat as you can."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,dark_thaumaturge,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:59:52 2015 UTC,"Others have said it better than I can, but the point of EDH should still be to win, totally - but it is ALSO the point try to make games FUN. In short, winning is not only an acceptable outcome, it is STILL the actual POINT of playing Magic. The only difference is, whereas in other formats you might well consider virtually any legal strategy as a viable option, in EDH you are also expected to take into consideration what might be ""fun"" for the people you are playing against.  This doesn't necessarily mean you have to proactively do things to make the game more fun for others, but rather you should simply avoid proactively making the game NOT fun.   In short, do whatever is fun for YOU, but if that turns out not to be fun for anyone else, you should respect that, and in turn they should respect you. If they are being condescending jerks toward you for simply doing what comes naturally to you, that's not really okay, but that's a different problem and a different conversation...  So basically, what I'm saying is, I still personally play to win, but I am explicitly aware of certain lines that are best not to cross - lest everyone else have a miserable experience and declined to offer me the chance to play future games.   The real problem, though, is figuring out where to draw those lines - because ""fun"" is subjective and wildly different from person to person."

Some people play EDH to watch all the rules of Magic be bent and see some weird stuff happen, and finally some people play EDH like Legacy/Vintage on steroids. Think about the setting and people you're playing with before you choose a deck to bring to the table. It holds true for whatever format you're playing, but especially true for EDH."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,Quentin_Coldwater,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:31 2015 UTC,"EDH really depends on the playgroup. Our playgroup is really casual and matches can take a while. Most of us don't have infinites, things that stall excessively, or things that unfun to play against (our houserule: Eldrazi don't have Annihilator, for instance). Our playgroup's mentality is ""as long as my deck did its thing, I'm happy."" If it also happens to win, hey, grats. I see other playgroups playing really oppressively and cutthroat, and that just isn't us. Point is, there could be a playgroup that's just for you, with people who are just as determined to win. If there's not, try to limit yourself. Set restrictions. If you see a powerful or degenerate combo, try to see if your deck also works without it. Part of Magic is deck construction, the other part of it is play. See if you can be just as Spikey on the playing part if you hold back a bit on the construction part."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,EnormousCock,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:36:09 2015 UTC,"My personal suggestion is to find an alternative play style you like, and try to win with that. For example, I have a Tribal Enchantments deck (Constellation primarily) which focuses largely around ETB triggers and interesting interactions to force opponents to think on their feet. Nothing says Fuck you and everything you love like Doomwake Giant + Enchanted Evening + Grave Betrayal."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,Idras_Hairline,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:02 2015 UTC,"EDH is a format that is designed to protect your ego.  Everyone's ego is different.  Thus, no matter what, you can't please everybody with your deck choice."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,Underscore_Talagan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"My friends and I all have a bare minimum of 2 decks. One is our baby, our beloved Commander deck that we pour our souls into and make as powerful and flavorful as possible.  In my group it's: Slivers (me) Animar (Buddy) Lazzav (Other buddy)  But we also have our flavor decks, that are strictly themed, not min-maxed but just put together. I have a Vorel of the Hull Clade all token deck where every card runs tokens or token manipulation, and a mono white Avacyn Angels. I'm trying to make a mono-blue mill, but might end up doing a Niv-Mizzet deck.  None of those decks have I bought singles, traded high-value cards, or theorycrafted the way I have with my Slivs, but they are all fun decks.  So on a typical night of commander, we play Smash Bros  to determine turn order. Then play with our competitive decks. Winner gets to go first when we play with our fun decks.   It's a great system that works for us, and satisfies both our thirst to win, and our love of flavor and themes.  There is also a rule that we don't play competitive decks in 1v1, only in multiplayer where diplomacy balances things out a little. We had to add that houserule due to my Slivers, hehehe."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,Gr33n-NiTr0,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:01:57 2015 UTC,"My best advice is to make a sillier deck or a themed deck. Then try to make that deck as good as you can. I saw someone make a like a commander deck, they got permission from their playgroup to do so, and s/he tried to make that deck for the lore. There could be no thassa in there because of their fight, but there could be bident of thassa because like a stole it. Earlier today I saw decklists for starfish tribal and it looked co pletely ridiculous and fun. It may not win all the time, but wining with an army of tiny sea creatures with hardly any features I think you'll have fun. You could even try for a pauper commander deck or as far as you can with it. It's not going to win as much, you have almost no netdecks available compared to non-pauper, and it's a challenge to make the deck."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,RobSobProb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:24:12 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna weigh in with something that has come to pass for me recently: I stopped playing EDH, exactly because it was never clear if I was supposed to try and win. The unclear level of power and competitiveness led to hurt butts in my own playgroup, and each other group I tried to play with had their own thing going on that I couldn't fit into.   In my experience, EDH goes from durdlefest to ""oops, I win"" in about 1 turn. I realized I wasn't having fun and stopped.   Hopefully you can resolve these issues and find some fun in EDH. Many people seem to find a balance and enjoy it, but I just can't."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,ArmadilloAl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:40:53 2015 UTC,"In general, you want to try to win, but you want to do it in roughly the same manner as everyone else.    The goal is to match wits with your opponents and win on their level, not bring a deck that's so far above their level that the game is no contest.  If everyone has a deck full of leftover draft commons, build a deck full of leftover draft commons and try to outmaneuver them on the battlefield."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,locorasuke,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:59:37 2015 UTC,"Eventually people just won't play with you if you combo them out all the time.

magicTCG,3dz9a5,monstersabo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:09:15 2015 UTC,"To me, EDH is the stuff dreams are made of. That new card in standard that looks fun or has amazing flavor gets you excited until you see the mana cost, that's an EDH card. EDH is like a big sandbox game with cheats enabled, do something fun with it.  EDH is a gentleman's agreement to spend a few turns getting warmed up to do something really cool. Winning is somewhat second to showing off that card interaction you feel so smugly clever about. Unlikely 3 card combos each costing at least 5 mana? We can get there. I guess it's a bit like sparring in that you don't really want to hurt anyone, but it is fun to horse around a bit.  Source: I built a Scion of the Ur-Dragon commander years ago (2$ back then) and I have watched it grow into something truly wonderful. GL HF"

A friend of mine in a super Spike-Johnny group isn't too far off when he describes EDH as being ""A bunch of people masturbating and then getting mad when someone finishes before them."", but a Timmy-Johnny group we both play in is amazingly fun.

magicTCG,3dz9a5,DaSmartio,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:52:55 2015 UTC,"EDH is the format that lets you be creative and win in different ways. Your deck is yours and yours alone and you can make it however you want it. However, mass land destruction, infinite combos, and certain commanders (Maelstrom Wanderer, Narset, etc) WILL make people upset. Try to avoid those of you can.  For an example, My main EDH deck is Alesha, Gob Zombie. It works by dumping cards like [[Ponyback Brigade]] or [[Beetleback Chief]] into the grave, continuously sac if and reanimating them, and using a lot of goblin tribal creatures and spells to make them huge. For instance, by turn 5 on one game, through use of Krenko, Warren Instigator, Goblin Cheiftain, Goblin Shrine, and the old RB card that makes goblins have +1/+1 and become zombies, I had an army of 10 Hasted 4/2 Goblins and murdered 2 of my opponents."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,IceMansicle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:56:41 2015 UTC,"To be honest I build with both philosophies in mind. Like using deadeye navigator with clone effects.  ""That is a nice Siege Rhino you have. It would be sad if someone happened to clone it and bounce the clone. Over and over again."" It is cool to see it happen. Honestly a clone is only as good as the creatures on the battlefield.  There are times I will pull out a really spikey Nekusar deck. I do have a friend that gets really pissed about wheel of fortune effects that is a reg in the playgroup. If he is there I won't play it. Our group tends to frown upon infect as being a too cheap way to win.  Anyways I am rambling. EDH is completely social. Political. If you have the spike deck or just are a dick you will get ganged up on."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,Kolbitos,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"Me and my friends all try to build the craziest decks.  Everyone's deck has ridiculous combos they can pull off.  Everyone is overpowered.  The game has this ebb and flow where you are trying to set yourself up with something big whilst preventing your opponents from gaining momentum.  This usually means there is one person every game who wipes the floor with everyone else.  We all take turns doing this though, and there isn't one deck that stands head and shoulders above the rest.  Everyone is playing to win, but we all have a great time, and we revel in each others big wins.  One of my friends loves to play with Heartless Hidetsugu.  He becomes an IMMEDIATE threat.  If no one draws the right cards to shut him down, he can win in very few turns.  It doesn't happen very often, but we all cheer when he wins with Sugu."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,Blasterbom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:56:31 2015 UTC,EDH is about being social and having a conversation and interactions with the other players that are interesting and fun.  Commander is about winning.  Determine your playgroups preference before choosing what you play with them.

magicTCG,3dz9a5,Erebus495,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:18:27 2015 UTC,"Short answer: Build a fun deck. Play to win. Play within the social contract of your playgroup.  Long Answer: As an EDH player, you can play to win, and people can choose not to play with you.  The key thing to remember is that EDH is a social format, based around a social contract. If you play the same deck to win, and combo out on turn 3-4 every game, chances are people won't want to play with you, unless your entire playgroup has the same level competitiveness decks.  You can still play to win, but a good rule of thumb is ""If I'm the only one having fun, no one's having fun."" If you manage to pull off some super sweet combo, and one of your opponents stops you with a fringe card you never expected, you can laugh it off and shuffle up another game. E.G: Tapped out to cast [[Comet Storm]], won counter war, opponent cast [[Deflecting Palm]].  EDH is often called Battleship Magic for a reason. It's all about big splashy, fun plays, not all of which end the game. Some of them are just big for the sake of being big. E.G: [[Capsize]] with Buyback, [[Radiate]] the Capsize during opponents end step (He was too far ahead with all his tokens).  You can still build a strong deck. You can still play to win. You can still play a consistent deck. But if that deck wins every single game, and the other players don't find it enjoyable, don't expect to get many games in before they stop playing with you."

It seems to be two different formats at once, and I wish they didn't share the same name and ban list but alas. The first format is basically vintage lite where everyone is either trying to combo off on turn 4 or harped lock the table with smokestack/winter orb ect. And the second is basically ""let's durdle around for awhile and then turn dragons sideways because that's good enough now."" Both are very fun and diverse formats  but if you have a problem with being ""that guy"" then your going to have to build decks for both formats, then when you sit down at a new table ask what the power level the group is playing at and pull out the according deck. This might be tricky on a budget but I for one have never played with someone who wasn't okay with proxies."

So It's basically like legacy or modern. Maybe you enjoy that if that's what you are looking for.  Here you can read more about the banlist and rules etc.   It's a 1on1 format for competitive EDH.
magicTCG,3dz9a5,SowingSalt,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:18:12 2015 UTC,"I have found that EDH is a primarily social format. So I design my decks in a way that they can resiliently try to somehow win.  In one of my playgroups (at uni) though, we decided that decks should not average more than $5 per card (we poor bro) any card above that should be a card that says, ""I resolve this, I'm wining the game right the f now or next turn. Make your time"" or we happen to have an expensive card.  I think your issue is that people at your table are annoyed that they have to sit watching you play solitaire (goldfish) while they could be playing an interactive game. I know in grindy games, I want the game to be advancing, someone to win in the next 2 turns, or the stasis player to win right the f--k now."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,InstaGlib,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:43:15 2015 UTC,"It should be fun, and since it tends to be multiplayer, if people play for the fun in winning most people will not have fun. So the decks should be designed with this in mind. What kind of game is fun even if you only get to be the active player 20% of the time and don't win? For me it's swingy, interactive game with politics (Not bickering and lots of deals, but cool plays that gives people the incentive to do your bidding). Build a deck that plays like that. It should be resilient, able to handle problem spells/permanents and allow you to play with cards that are to weird/costly to fit in a well oiled 60 card deck. Initially, EDH was also designed with variation in mind. Don't build a tutor engine, build a deck that surprises you and keeps you and your opponents on your toes.  Edit: and it shouldn't have super time consuming turns."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,chrisrazor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:43:56 2015 UTC,"The key is to build a ""75%"" deck. Or if you can't bring yourself to water it down, base your deck on the weakest strategy you can imagine (eg white weenie, which is terrible in EDH) and build the best deck you can.  Edit: another alternative is French EDH aka Duel Commander. It's the same deck building rules (with a slightly different banlist) but played 1-on-1. As someone who loves the format but is not hugely keen on the politics of multiplayer, I wish more people played it."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,GeneralBobby,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:22:13 2015 UTC,"This is perhaps the touchiest point about EDH. Some people play because they want to play a big game of Magic with creatures, enchantments, board states, etc. They're fine with a game taking an hour with 20 turns. Others play EDH like they're playing 100 card Legacy and tune their deck to win in the first five turns. Neither way is wrong, but those two kinds of players do not mix very well together.     I fall into the first camp. Around here, most stores hold a commander night that costs about the same as FNM. If I pay $5 for FNM I'm getting at least 3 rounds in if only 8 people show up. At EDH night, I pay the same and my night could be over in five minutes if 100 card legacy guy shows up and combos out on turn 3.     Play what you want, but if you are crushing people consistently then perhaps you should tone down your deck or build a second that is more in line with your meta."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,jsweet4979,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:50:02 2015 UTC,"You just need to feel it out with your playgroup.  I will say that the multiplayer aspect of EDH makes it somewhat self-correcting, as long as the gap doesn't get too wide:  If one player's deck is 30% better than anybody else at the table, then everyone is going to gang up on that one person.  If one player's deck is 30% worse than anybody else at the table, then they are going to fly under the radar (I've actually won some games with brand new totally untuned craptastic decks, because everybody ignored me and beat on each other until it was just me and another guy with 10 life left -- and then I topdecked the perfect answer).  I do feel that, unless you're doing competitive EDH, you should keep it light on the tutors.  The fun of EDH is being able to execute your plan without being able to rely on any particular card(s) (except your commander, of course).  That doesn't mean you can't have any, but go light I would say.   And yeah, I dunno, it depends on your group.  My EDH decks, I could take them to some groups and they'd laugh me out of the room.  Then I take them to other groups and I kind of run over everybody.  So it depends."
magicTCG,3dz9a5,SpyglassSuperior,0,Tue Jul 21 13:24:46 2015 UTC,"The important point to consider is that EDH isn't a tournament format.  There aren't packs on the line, no one will move up in standing from a victory.  People are playing exclusively for fun.  If your deck and playstyle only win by preventing the people at your table from having fun, you've resulted in a net loss of fun rather than a net gain.  Since fun is the only thing people are playing for, your deck will be unreasonable by these standards.    It's a hard transition to make, and I've seen people struggle to switch over from standard where it's perfectly sensible to destroy the only land an opponent has of a color they need: that's a resource and if you can deny them resources, you win.    In commander, though, lots of people aren't there to prove their skill and win-- they're there for the epic, grand story of the battle.  If you eliminate them from that story before they even get started, you've ruined the game."

The following statement made me realize that some people just shouldn't play EDH:  ""I'm sorry that I don't have your fun in mind when I build my decks"".   Really?  You plan to sit at a table with people for more than an hour in most cases and the only thing you can think of is winning?   EDH is about the experience of sharing the game with others, not winning at the cost of other's enjoyment.  This format should be taken slowly, with a desire to see the crazy events that happen when magic's biggest spells are viable, when the board state is so cluttered that everyone is praying for Wrath of God, when you're in the lead and your ally for the last hour says ""Sorry, but you have to die now"".

Due to the lack of defined archetypes, it is pretty easy to surprise someone with a combo win, which feels bad, but afterwards, when people know about your stasis lock, but you manage it through a tide of counterspells and spot removal, I am fine with that win, but if you are not ok with 3 players trying to kill you before you get your combo, then it may be time to choose a more political deck."

My first and only EDH deck is a Narset control deck and it has made someone mad every game so I tend not to be as controlling now and let people do stuff. That being said, it's hard being casual when all you are used to is trying to win, believe me. I typically borrow an EDH deck from one of the other players after the first game because after I get the ""No you can't do that"" or ""all your stuff is gone"" out of my system, I like learning a new deck and it is more fun learning on the fly."

That way, I don't sit down to a game with people new to the format and pull out the most powerful deck. My 75% decks are usually mono green because people don't tend to complain about big dumb creatures if there isn't any counter magic to protect them. I also have a deck that I play that is specifically built to stop combos. I pull it out at casual tables when I get the feeling that someone is probably trying to show off and crush new players with an optimized deck."

However, I understand that not everyone has the money/card catalogue to have a first rate deck.  So I usually end up playing as the equalizer.  I ensure no one gets too out of hand too quickly. That being said once the game has gone through at least 6-7 rounds I will let the game play out and I will start to look to deploy my win conditions.    While the use of ""competitive"" EDH decks can be fun, it's only really the case when everyone has a deck of equal power.  Otherwise, it becomes oppressive and rather un-fun.  I have been a part of many games when only 1 or 2 people are actually playing magic while everyone else waits for the stack/turn to end.  We've actually played another game of magic or two while they wait!  The other thing EDH allows you to do is build some derpy decks that enable some fun but interesting mechanics that you can't do in any other format."

magicTCG,3dz9a5,MTG_Anarchy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:26:32 2015 UTC,"When I built a good deck to win, I grew bored of them after a short time. My longest lasting winning deck, was Kruphix, which lasted a couple months.  For me, I'd rather play an enjoyable game that I can play the things I want to. If those things help me win, it's even better. So long as the victor isn't an complete jackass about winning, and doesn't drag the game on unnecessarily longer, I'm fine with that.  That being said, it all depends on your playgroup. If they're ultra competitive, go for the win, be brutal and merciless. If they're more casual, just play something silly. Something that can still win, but makes for an enjoyable game for the entire group."

magicTCG,3dxwfw,BananaSlim,4,Tue Jul 21 13:23:52 2015 UTC,"The discrepancy in win percentage between on-the-play and on-the-draw puts an emphasis on having an effective sideboarding plan against the meta.  One might argue that it helps keep unfair decks in check by putting them on-the-draw half of the time, making it that much harder to combo off on turn 2 or 3.  I don't know how healthy it is for the format one way or the other, but I do believe that people want to play a game of skill at least as much as playing a game of chance.  If the game is left too much to chance, then why even bring a deck at all?  Why not just hold a tournament of people rolling dice?  I think the scry-on-mulligan rule change is a step in the right direction.  Maybe it will be augmented in the future to be scry-on-the-draw, but I'm not entirely sure that we want to try to eliminate entirely the advantage of being on-the-play."

Tron's overall strategy is one that any LE player lives for which is not pressuring for the first couple turns and heavily relying on specific lands.

magicTCG,3dxwfw,georg51,7,Mon Jul 20 15:07:32 2015 UTC,"There's really a couple of ways to fight RoP.   The first thing you can do is force them to blow it up - this means using a Cascade-Living End with a few creatures in your yard, just enough to force them to use it.  Then simply reload through cycling and go again. The next thing you can do is use Ingot Chewers or Beast Withins, or (I have 2 main board now) Kolaghan's Command to destroy it, forcing them to use it or lose it. Then simply cycle/reload. The third, and least favorable option, is to ignore it outright.  This means playing a ""fair"" game and keeping them off Tron with your Fulminator Mages/Beast Withins/etc.  This option is very risky because our creatures are not very good when played straight up, and giving a Tron deck time to assemble is never a good idea.   Honestly, post-board the match-up becomes very easy depending on how many Ingot Chewers you have (I have 3 in the board).  Beast Within is your best card in the match-up.  My brother built Tron 3 years ago when I first built Living End, and I have played this match-up hundreds of times, and while facing multiple Relics is nearly a death-sentence, you have to take into consideration that outside of that card, the Tron deck struggles really bad against LE.  EDIT Posted in a comment on this thread just above by /u/taumxd, to reiterate my point:   Relic is very annoying, but a good draw from Living End is usually able to overpower a Relic in my experience (you cycle 2-3 creatures, try to living end, they pop relic, you cycle some more). Also we have at least 3 ingot chewers to bring in post board to break them before cycling."

magicTCG,3dxwfw,megathrasher,5,Mon Jul 20 16:27:05 2015 UTC,"Really interesting stuff!  I wonder how much the source of the data affects things. It's fairly obvious that more complex decks have a higher skill threshold - they take longer to learn to play and longer to master. In particular, control deck players need to have an almost encyclopedic knowledge of every deck in the format and what they are trying to accomplish on each turn in order to beat them,  Since most MTGO players will be roughly average at best (and indeed, likely to be below average, because the pros tend to playtest more among themselves than against black_lotus777 online), it's likely the people playing the more difficult decks like control will NOT have all of the requisite knowledge needed to play optimally.  At the same time, decks like burn and affinity have a much lower skill threshold. Yes, the cap is still high, but the threshold for playing well is fairly low - you can just shove all your cards at your opponent and it often works.  In other words: the main thing this analysis shows that the average player does better with simple, linear decks, over decks with a high skill threshold, rather than Deck X is better than deck Y  This is a GREAT analysis if you are looking for a deck to play pickup 8-mans on MTGO with but you'll need to focus on PTQ top 8's and day 2 of GP's if you want to find the best deck to win a large tournament."
magicTCG,3dxwfw,thephotoman,7,Mon Jul 20 17:13:30 2015 UTC,"I find playing DE and such online is comparable skill level to PTQs and day 1 GPs, you're underestimating the average MTGO player vs live player"

magicTCG,3dxwfw,DressedSpring1,6,Tue Jul 21 00:17:24 2015 UTC,"There's two sides to that coin, though. Most of the people who choose a deck like Jeskai Control are pretty good players. Players generally won't choose to buy a deck that they don't think they can play. That's probably why we see such a high percentage with Jeskai Control. On the other hand, a deck like Burn is going to be piloted by a lot of bad players due to a perception (accurate or not)  that it's an autopilot deck, which pushes its percentage down way lower than we would expect for a tier one deck."
magicTCG,3dxwfw,CaioNintendo,3,Mon Jul 20 17:42:59 2015 UTC,"Most of the people who choose a deck like Jeskai Control are pretty good players.    I think it's fair to say that they THINK they are pretty good players. That being said, you're right - the average jeskai control player is likely better than the average burn player. The question is, are they better enough to overcome the higher skill threshold? I honestly don't know.  EDIT: Ultimately, I think the point is that we can't know how well each deck performs against the other decks with a skilled pilot unless we look at data that actually has skilled pilots playing against each other. Trying to extrapolate from low-stakes MTGO play is interesting but not rigorous enough to use for deck selection for a major tournament.  EDI2: Which is not to say this isn't cool and useful - just that we need better data to take it further :)"

I've seen a couple of sideboards that included Leyline of Punishment, but I cannot imagine why I want that outside of my opening hand (where it would help dramatically against Anafenza's Company and Abzan).

Boosters are fun if you want to open them up and make a deck vs another person who is also opening up a few packs to make a mini deck. This is called ""drafting"" or ""sealed"".  However if you want to just play against a friend casually, duel decks are balanced, meant for 2 players, and gives a decent base of how a magic game will go.  Buying ""Commander"" decks is also a popular option. There are a few that are quite cheap on amazon, and getting a few of those will allow you to play a multiplayer game!  Boosters are almost never the way to go unless you really just want the experience of opening a pack, or for drafting.  If you want to play competitively, you're better off buying the cards you need single from card stores or online."

magicTCG,3e1guc,aznsk8s87,4,Tue Jul 21 06:09:09 2015 UTC,"Well, then you're probably better off getting single cards for a deck you want to build. If you don't know how to play and want to learn, there's 30 card intro decks that the stores give away for free to players who want to learn. If you use those, you can learn how to play! From there, you can start to buy what you want and make a good deck!"
magicTCG,3e1guc,Atmosck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:35:45 2015 UTC,"We all had to start somewhere.  Do you know what type of event your store has on Friday nights? Mine runs what are called drafts, where no one shows up with a deck they built, but we are given some packs with which to make a deck (everyone opens a pack, takes a card, passes it around, takes another card, etc).   That said. Deck building takes practice and experience. I think if you have no idea what to do, ask someone at your store to help you learn how to play. Maybe buy an intro deck or clash pack. The decks won't be competitive by any means but they're a great place to learn how to play."
magicTCG,3e1guc,fantom546,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:55:59 2015 UTC,"I would recommend drafting. It's a good way to get to play on equal footing with everyone without having to already own cards, and it's a good way to slowly build your collection. Why spend $12 on three packs and just open them, when you could spend $12 on the cards in he packs, 4 hours of fun (and getting better at the game!) and possibly more packs as prizes?  If you do draft, though, I would recommend reading up on what cards are in the set and trying to form some opinions about which ones are good. When you draft you have ~60 seconds to decide which of 15 cards is the best, and that can be kind of difficult if you're reading the cards for the first time."

However my friends took me to a card shop for the first time today and I bought an event deck. We got home and played a few games and my event deck was 5 times more fun to play then the deck I made with my 1,000 card pack. I recommend getting an event deck as it will give you something that you can jump right in with and change a few cards out to fit your play style. I hear event decks rarely win tournaments, but they can place 3rd or 4th fairly often."

magicTCG,3e1guc,coppersulphate,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:54:27 2015 UTC,"You should figure out what formats are played at the game store - see if it's just standard, or if there's limited,  either draft or sealed (where you open packs and build a deck with them each time you play) is played, or maybe edh/commander (typically a much more casual format).  Prerelease, a sealed event the weekend before each set release, is also great for new players.   If you are interested in standard, I would suggest either buying cards individually or playing in drafts to build a collection. If you're interested in limited, you're in luck - zero setup required, though it is a bit tougher to get started with from a learning standpoint. If you're interested in edh/commander, which is much more complicated but is also more casual (usually - your experience may vary, and you'd really have to ask the other players). Once you've settled on where you want to start, you can get some more specific advice. Magic the Amateuring is also a good podcast to look into.   Alternatively, if you just have friends you would play with casually outside of these tournaments, I cannot endorse the deck builder's toolkit enough."

That will give you an understanding of the basic mechanics and flow of the game.  If you have that knowledge already, I would participate in a local booster draft. This is the best way to gain experience with playing the game while you build a collection.Eventually when you build a decent sized collection, you can decide what Constructed decks you would like to build and then trade/buy the pieces you need.

magicTCG,3e1guc,Scullyx,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:06 2015 UTC,"Welcome!  First, I caution against first-time TCG players starting with a Clash Pack, Event Deck, Duel Deck or Commander product - they contain cards with more complicated effects (sometimes much more complicated) and rules over-and-above an already mildly complex game. People pick up the rules fairly quickly, so it's easy to forget what it's like in the first month or so. So, proceed with caution. Second, people also say to only buy singles (i.e. individual cards from a physical or online shop) because it is more economical - this is correct; but, not necessarily useful for you at this point. You need to know what you want before you start buying individual cards, so purchasing packs is as good a way to explore the game as anything else.  Step 1 - I suggest starting with going to the game store (LGS - local game store), if available, with and asking for a Sample Deck or two and for someone to show you how to play. You aren't going to learn everything you need to know from one ""lesson"" but it'll be enough to get your group started. Play with the Sample Deck(s) for a few days to a week just so you understand what's going on ""with the training wheels on.""  Step 2 - You have a few choices:   Magic: Origins Intro Decks - these are relatively simple rules-wise and meant to be customized and act as a starting point that can be taken a few different directions; each comes with 2 Booster Packs Other Intro Decks - decks from expansion sets will have more complicated mechanics introduced in the expansion/block and are meant to highlight those mechanics; they are also meant to be customized Deck Builder's Tookit - think of this as a box of Lego blocks. This give you a reasonable quantity of cards with which to build decks and has some guidelines to help you build your first decks.   Step 3 - OK, you've been playing for a little while. What do you want out of Magic? Are you going to play mostly casually? Do you want to compete in tournaments? Both? The answers to these questions will guide your further purchases and the internet is full of ideas and recommendations."
magicTCG,3e1guc,Atmosck,5,Tue Jul 21 13:36:43 2015 UTC,"Go to your local LGS and get the free magic starter decks they hand out. Id probably buy an origins fatpack, they are fun and come with helpful goodies. Maybe the origins clash pack too if you can get it for a cheap price.  Ive only been playing for 2-3 weeks and my plan has been to just attend LGS draft events and build up my collection that way. Already got quite a few cards from the prerelease and release day sealed decks and I get to play against people with those cards on an even playing field and get experience. Good value  I dont got 300$+ to spend to be able to play Standard and honestly it just feels pointless and boring and skill-less to just copy paste the winning decks from a tournament into a checkout bag online and get it all in the mail.

This is a pretty common viewpoint among new players. The fact is, for most competitive players the skill isn't in the deck building, the skill is in the playing and in the minor changes to a deck you make based on what decks you expect to play against. Being better at deck building is just not how you win in constructed."

I started playing Magic roughly about 3 months ago with the Commander 2013 Naya Deck (Green, Red, White). Commander decks are composed of 100 singleton cards. While that might seem overwhelming at first, it will get you well accumulated to a variety of different cards while still providing beginner friendly social format where most players are more than happy to help out a new player. Since Commander is typically a multop layer format, you will discover all sorts of differnt playstyles which will allow you to determini your own favored playstyle."

He acquires power and influence through the collection of knowledge and through deception and almost never does any of the dirty work himself - only in the most dire of situations. Mono-black would not have any qualms about doing the dirty work, nor Petyr's patience which spans decades.

Although it does not take this as far as white does, green sees intrinsic value in coming together for the benefit of the whole group.""   Mance became ""The King Beyond the Wall"" because he united the Free Folk who have been warring with each other for thousands of years. He united them under one single purpose, which is to survive (a very green word). They were in a perpetual state on conflict until Mance brought them together. He wants them to co-exist peacefully. That is a very green motive.   ""It dislikes the trappings of civilization, believing that the natural laws are the only laws that should be obeyed.""  ""another of the color's core principles is strength and the concept of the survival of the fittest.""   Mance to Jon Snow:  ""Free folk don't follow names, or little cloth animals sewn on a tunic. They won't dance for coins, they don't care how you style yourself or what that chain of office means or who your grandsire was. They follow strength. They follow the man.""  He brought the order to the free folk and he did so without imposing law. That's very green and not very red.

Black: Asha Greyjoy   She had heard enough of this. A sickly mother, a murdered father, and a plague of uncles were enough for any woman to contend with; she did not require a lovesick puppy too.

Roose is obviously the Black that is in conflict with White. He's almost completely amoral (though not entirely: he did shy away from kinslaying when first presented with his bastard son).  Asha, on the other hand, is the Black that is in conflict with Green. Green would have her be content with the Old Way and the gender roles she's expected to accept, but Asha recognises that the former isn't sustainable and the latter simply isn't what she wants, and so she takes action to dismantle both.

As Warden of the North, Lord Bolton would be incredibly B/W - he now makes laws. He does not break them, because then why would people follow him?  As the conspirator, he would be Blue-Black because he is careful to deceive and manipulate. Calculation and timing are required to be perfect, and just the right moment for him to make the move which will matter most.  As the torturer, the artist who flays men, Black-Green. He is free to indulge, free to let his skill show and free to show his true self. He doesn't have to couch his self in anything but the practiced hands of someone who knows what he is doing.   . . . however, Roose isn't very easily to place in Red at all.

A being doesn't need to be Black to perform evil acts if those acts are justified under its belief system.

magicTCG,3dyepo,J_Golbez,18,Mon Jul 20 19:54:10 2015 UTC,"It's because of classic elemental associations, as found in sources like the four humors theory, the Aristotelian elements, and tarot suit associations from occultism.  The associations are substantially different. In humorism, the four humors and associated elements and mental states are:   Blood — air — passion, playfulness Yellow bile — fire — ambition, anger Black bile — earth — depression, analysis Phlegm — water — calm, patience   In occult alchemical and tarot associations:   Fire — intuition — Wands Water — emotion — Cups Air — reason — Swords Earth — physicality — Coins/Discs/Pentacles   So with passion associated with red and fire in Magic, reason has to go either to air or water. White has some of the air association by way of angel imagery, so blue gets the rest.  It's worth noting that the five-color system looks somewhat like the Chinese classical elements (fire, water, earth, metal, and wood) and somewhat like the Aristotelian four plus ""quintessence"" (the element of spirit) for white. In the Chinese system, ""metal"" is associated both with lake or swamp, and with the celestial aether by way of meteoric iron.  In any event, occultism is a good way to get yourself very confused and get a lot of silly ideas. Games are safer. :)"

Fire on the other hand is yes, ephemeral, but it's short lived, and unlike water and air it's always volatile and doesn't hide anything.  Also, red is definitely partly an ephemeral color. Red is emotional and impulsive, its creatures tend not to be very resilient, temporary mana generation has moved from black to red, and next to blue it has the highest ratio of instants and sorceries to permanent spells."

It will catch something alight, and the moment it gets the opportunity, it will spread. Fire grows quickly, and without hesitation. Hence why it represents Red.  Water, on the other hand, is slow. It takes a long time for water to change anything; the changes it causes are tiny, almost imperceptible, but over the course of time they add up to something fire couldn't even hope to achieve, like carving a canyon from a simple stream.

Is countermagic just the ultimate expression of 'preparedness' because you can only use it at the right moment?   He went into this in the podcast on the topic (and probably in some of the other dozen places he's discussed this).  Blue's biggest weakness is that it's slow. It doesn't burn, it freezes. It doesn't stab, it drowns. Blue's power is gradual erosion. This means that it can't match force for force, it'll lose every time (assuming Wizards isn't arbitrary making blue the beatdown color like in Innistrad block). So it's figured out that it doesn't have to overpower the opponent, it can merely tire them out by turning away the opponent's attacks. It doesn't have to make a bigger fireball, it can just extinguish yours.  Control magic is the natural combination of this philosophy and blue's use of mind magic. Rather than summon their own creatures, it can take control of your weak-minded creatures, neutralizing a threat and generating their own in one fluid reaction."

magicTCG,3dyepo,cheesechimp,8,Mon Jul 20 19:17:10 2015 UTC,"After multiple rewatches, I'm honestly not entirely sure I even trust Kyubey's claims regarding entropy. Kyubey claims to not conceptually understand lying, but even though we never see him saying anything verifiably false he is incredibly deceptive. For example: Madoka and Kyoko ask Kyubey if Sayaka can be turned back from being a witch. Kuybey tells them the honest truth ""it's never happened before"" but intentionally misleads them by saying ""but the existence of magical girls itself defies logic."" In a vacuum, each of Kyubey's statements is true, but in context it's intentionally planting false ideas into the girls' minds. If Kyubey is capable of such willful deception, who's to say that he's not lying about being able to make bold-faced lies, and who's to say he's not lying about the reasoning behind his actions?  Edit: For what it's worth I agree that, when taken at face value, Kyubey does qualify as a white/blue villain."
magicTCG,3dyepo,cheesechimp,8,Mon Jul 20 19:25:27 2015 UTC,Kyubey claims to not conceptually understand lying   The concept of stating things that are not true is completely off the wall to him.  Stringing together facts to give false impressions is another thing.
magicTCG,3dyepo,Everspace,6,Mon Jul 20 20:23:23 2015 UTC,"I think Kyubey's behavior can be explained as WU with one very specific bit of blue's unemotional tendency: he has no concept of regret, whatsoever. He does not understand that humans sometimes make decisions that they later do not like. He doesn't possess, and cannot empathize with, the reaction ""If only I hadn't ...!""  Mono-blue characters can also be plenty deceptive, even telling overt lies to people they are close to.

Essentially what Kyubey says is ""There are a complex set of circumstances that you don't really understand, but you doing what I want you to plays into them in a way that makes the world a better place."" That preys heavily on Madoka's character motivations; exploiting her desire to help others. Note that Kyubey tells Madoka this when she's at her farthest from agreeing to make a contract with him, so he needs to pull out a big trump card. Plus, what Kyubey says makes sense if you have only a vague, sketchy understanding of what entropy is, but if I'm not mistaken it doesn't really hold up to too intense scientific scrutiny. He sounds authoritative, but does it really work?"
magicTCG,3dyepo,optimis344,4,Mon Jul 20 20:56:11 2015 UTC,"I would personally take a more fantastical approach.

The heat death of the universe is a real thing, although not going to happen in billions of years. When you put hot and cold water in a cup, you eventually just get a tepid melange.

If White thinks what it is doing is for the good of the group, it is okay with doing it. It might feel bad, but it will still do it. Sometimes White justifies it though, because if the people being killed were really good people they would be okay with sacrificing themselves for the greater good, and if they are not okay with that then they are bad people who White views as dangerous to society and thus is okay with killing them. (See White's opinions on Red and Black.)  A better way to say this is that a character who is white can be someone who rigidly refuses to kill anyone or someone who is willing to kill thousands to save millions.

Black and red are one flavor: if you tap out against burn at 3 life, they will take that opportunity to kill you. They see a window, and they take it immediately. In that respect, blue is not 'opportunistic'. Blue looks for long term opportunity, by gathering resources to take advantage of future opportunity. Blue will draw lots of cards, and if it survives to the late game, it will have an answer to whatever arises.

Where you would want to drop a one-mana spell, say an Elvish Mystic, on turn one you can't because your land enters tapped. If you're playing a control deck on 4 land facing down lethal next turn from a mono-red player and you draw a tapped land, it's game over.  Fetch lands are significantly better in the older formats where they can search up Shocks or Duals, but they're still good in Standard. Giving fuel for Delve which a lot of decks make use of is good too."
magicTCG,3e3mvu,Slangster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:09 2015 UTC,Because coming into the battlefield tapped is that much of a drawback. Say you have 2 fetches in hand and a card that costs two mana. You can play that card on turn two. If you have two lands that enter the battlefield tapped instead you are now putting off that play until turn 3. This sets you back a decent amount of tempo.

Wooded foothills has two other effects - one being that you get to shuffle your deck (which is important if you know what your next card is due to a card like courser of kruphix) as well as thinning your deck by one land (making it less likely to pull a land in the future)
magicTCG,3e3mvu,Slottm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:30:49 2015 UTC,"Because they fetch shocklands and real duals, put a card in your graveyard for delver, and shuffle away the top of your library for cards like Brainstorm and Courser.  Also   entering the battlefield tapped, but that can't be that much of a drawback ETB tapped lands put you a turn behind on tempo.

You gain one life from the dual lands, but it comes out tapped so you can't play it that turn. Fetchlands, which costs you a life, comes out with you able to pick one of two basic lands which come out untapped ready to use.   I have a red/black dash deck and I'd rather have my Bloodstained Mire cost me a life and have the land I need ready to use to dash a creature out than the red/black dual land where I have to wait a turn to use.   I've started using my life total as a resource instead of a treasure to be guarded at all costs. My win rate has gone up and I've been having more fun.   Hope this helps a little. :)"

magicTCG,3e3mvu,jMS_44,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:37 2015 UTC,The reason is the simple fact that they come into play untapped. Coming into play untapped is such a huge upside and often decides games. If your deck only consists of taplands it is the same as your every spell costing 1 more to cast as you would have to cast them the turn later.   Let's take for example the Esper Dragons deck from pre origins standard. Against aggressive decks it was a necessity to have a counter up by turn 2. If you had only taplands you would often even consider mulliganing as there's a very high risk of just getting run over.  Aggressive decks want untap lands in order to play as aggressive as possible. Controlling decks want untap lands in order to keep up with the aggressive decks.
magicTCG,3e3mvu,Foolero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:49 2015 UTC,"A flooded strand can grab any shockland or dual with white or blue so it can get any color it wants.

magicTCG,3e3mvu,TechnicalV,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:08 2015 UTC,"In addition to every other point that has been made, fetch lands protect you from targeted land destruction like Wasteland. If you play a Rugged Highlands and your opponent plays Wasteland and blows it up, you're now hugely behind on tempo; you couldn't play your spells on schedule the turn you played Highlands, and now you're stuck essentially redoing that same turn. With a fetch, however, your opponent can Wasteland, and then you just crack your fetch in response and get your dual. It forces your opponent to hold the Wasteland up until after you actually crack your fetch, and even then you either still get to utilize the mana from your land since it enters untapped or you fetch a basic and now they can't waste you.  Obviously, this is only really a big factor in Legacy and Vintage, and only a little bit in Modern. However, it is yet another reason why the fetch lands are the best ""dual"" lands ever printed. (I say ""dual"" because a single uncracked fetch represents access to any color of mana until you actually decide which land to fetch.)"

Consider Heroic cards like Favored Hoplite. Between Feats and Commands you have enough tricks to get it going. God's Willing is also nice."
magicTCG,3e3j04,MarkZwei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:12:51 2015 UTC,That's all a good point. I'll drop the dragons for now and add the Bond-Kin and Falconer. I wish I had the Hoplite and maybe Phalanx Leader then I'd add those and God's Willing.
magicTCG,3e3j04,MarkZwei,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:34 2015 UTC,"Consider a little streamlining when you have the chance. See what performs best. 2 Cit.Sieges, 4 Hardened Scales and 2 Brave the Sands are all the enchantments I run. 4 commands, 4 charms and 4 feats. Everything else is land and creatures.  Servant of the Scales is also the greatest budget card of the deck; the counters multiply like magic and always make removing it a trap unless it is alone. Get a full playset if you can!"

Nice thing about the lens is it doubles your mana but only for a single type of land, so if you mix in other non basics that decreases the power you get from the lens.  The only creature I have bellow 4 mana is Serra avenger. And she can't even be played before turn 4 lol.

magicTCG,3e3a49,ccrowder5,-15,Tue Jul 21 17:04:17 2015 UTC,"1 You always have a combat step even if you choose not to attack, so you get to tap a creature of your opponent's even if they don't want to attack.  2 Your opponent moves to combat, you are passed priority, you tap the Mage-Ring Responder and pass back priority, Your opponent chooses legal attackers and passes priority to you.  They don't get a chance to untap the Responder until it is too late to declare as an attacker."
magicTCG,3e3a49,Unununium1,7,Tue Jul 21 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"Regarding #2, I'm pretty confident that there's another round of priority after the Sentinel's triggered ability resolves. Because of this, your opponent does have an opportunity to pay 7 after the sentinel trigger but before declaring attackers."
magicTCG,3e3a49,AndrewWaldron,4,Tue Jul 21 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"I'm with unununium1 on this.  All this happens in the beginning of combat, before attackers are chose.      Beginning of Combat: Opponent does nothing, passes priority; You tap MRB with Sentinel, pass priortiy; Opponent responds by paying 7 to untap M-RR, passes priority back to you; You have no play, stack resolves as follows: M-RR Untaps, Sentinel tap MRB; proceed to declare attackers.      At this point Opponent would swing with M-RR to deal 7 to your Sentinel (I hope anyway)."

I'd suggest just getting sleeves you prefer from one of the better brands (see Tolarian Community College reviews on youtube) and sleeving your deck up in those, you'll get used to the feeling quickly enough and a single sleeved deck isn't that bulky."

In fact, by following the naming conventions of sports for those things, it muddies those waters.   I'm not a hardcore follower of pro magic, and I don't play competitively. I still believe that stats should definitely be a component of the voting. But having people that I, as a casual player (long term like I am, or for newbies) can look up to, admire, and wish to emulate, in the HoF is much more important than how many games they've won.  I realise at this point I'm just rehashing your own opinion back at you, so I'll just say that you're not alone in this line of thinking, and I wish it was more prevalent than the numbers arguments.

Such blind adherence to some arbitrary rules that were set forth unofficially and by some voters is ridiculous, and THAT is what weakens the HoF, when fame becomes less important than victories, and when impact becomes less important than placing in the top 8.  This is the reason why people who should be there by all means and measures still aren't, because people fail to realize that the hall of fame isn't the hall of victories.  Frankly, you know what weakens the hall of fame? The fact that Chris Pikula and Justin Gary, who had much more impact and importance than many other hall of famers, still aren't there."

magicTCG,3e337u,zroach,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:16:16 2015 UTC,Each player opens their booster and removes the token (replacing double faced cards with the checklist)  Players are not allowed to look at their pack  Each player shuffles their pack and draws 3 cards(no mulligans allowed)  Each player gets one action per turn where they can play any legal card in hand. Tapping a land will grant another action  Anything with a mana cost will use an action to activate  Players start with 10 life  Players will not lose if they can't draw  Games usually last less than 5 minutes and everything is very silly
magicTCG,3e337u,Godort,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:04 2015 UTC,"We play ""Mana Cube"". Crack a pack, take out the token, shuffle up, draw 7. At the beginning of your first precombat main phase, put a d6 into play on ""1"".  On each subsequent precombat main phase, increase the die by 1. This die is the Mana Cube, and represents how much Mana you have available to you until your next untap step. Mana can be used from the cube at anytime and of any color.  This format is pretty fun. We leave the basic land in the pack as a method for ramping."

magicTCG,3e32cj,WhiskerMeowTown,2,Tue Jul 21 16:06:38 2015 UTC,"No downtime at all. Get food and drink if you finish your round early, there's no ""lunch break"". You can factor in time between rounds, that is the time between the clock officially ends and when the next round starts. This can go between 10 to 20 minutes depending on the organization, number of players, and speed of the format.   There's plenty of vendor to buy cards and accessories. Remember, you might get some free stuff just for playing in the main event (e.g., playmat, deck box, sleeves), and this will vary from GP to GP. My advice is to sell cards early and buy cards later. Some vendors will sell cards cheaper on Sunday when they need to pack up and/or want to get rid of stock.   The side events are open for everyone, you just need to sign up for them. This includes the Super Sunday Series.   Most importantly, have fun!"

OKAY 10 MANA, COLOSSUS, HASTE, RAGE, HEXPROOF.   also almost guarantee'ing yourself a win with a 3 card combo isn't good to you? it's not like im talking magical christmas land of turn 1 monestary, turn 2 prowess monk, turn 3 3 titan's strengths and win the game. it's 3 cards midgame. sure the probability of having all 3 of them in your hand is (1 choose 4)(1 choose 4)(1 choose 4)(2 choose 48) / (5 choose 60) but it's not THAT aweful. you've got your opening hand and 6 turns to draw the cards you need."

They were incredible every time I cast them - was able to recover from Languish and drawing a creature off of each of their removal spells just felt dirty. Dromoka's command doesn't even really stop it because if they choose fight+sac you can sac the fight target in response and the command gets countered so you don't lose Leap.   EDIT: It's been pointed out that I was wrong, you do still have to sac Leap to a Command. It still ends up being a 1 for 1."
magicTCG,3dyfbc,tordana,3,Mon Jul 20 20:19:05 2015 UTC,"Not quite. Dromoka's Command will resolve if any of its targets are valid, and do as much as it can with the targets that remain. If the Command player doesn't have enough targets to start with, it can't be cast, but it will resolve unless every target is illegal. (For example, you can counter the entirety of a Cryptic Command where only one mode targets by removing the target; the other half of Cryptic won't resolve.) I have a dream of one day killing someone with their own Demonic Pact by getting rid of every creature on the board so that they can't cast Dromoka's Command."

magicTCG,3dyfbc,Epic_Hax_Guy,4,Tue Jul 21 08:45:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, firstly I know nothing about actually piloting [[Scapeshift]] or [[High tide]]. That said, does Animist's awakening affect these decks?  It looks like it can take Scapeshift from a lot of lands, to a lethal number of lands. And if you have spell mastery, it could generate the mana to cast the Scapeshift that turn.  In hightide, if you have spell mastery, which you likely will unless you just resolved [[Time Spiral]], this looks like an extra [[Candelabra of Tawnos]]. I imagine it's not always as good as Candelabra, but thinning out lands does sound relevant when you're spiraling for a kill card."
magicTCG,3dyfbc,gatheringcommons,5,Mon Jul 20 18:15:30 2015 UTC,"In Scapeshift:  The deck isn't looking for a spell like this. The number of lands needed to be lethal is really not that high (7-8 is usually enough, especially considering most decks in Modern will deal damage to themselves with fetches/shocks/Thoughtseize/Bob/etc.). Animist's Awakening is something that really needs to be cast for a decent X to be reasonable. When Scapeshift has enough lands to cast Awakening for value, they could probably just win by casting a Scapeshift instead, so they're better off with just digging to find a Scapeshift or permission to protect it.  In High Tide:  Part of the deck's strength is its immunity to Wasteland by playing only basic Island (and fetches), and adding green would ruin that. Additionally, the deck is a combo-control deck, not a dedicated combo deck - it normally tries to use various permission spells and some disruption to stall until it gets enough land and the correct spells for the combo. It isn't trying to ramp out the combo as fast as possible, and again there is the ""going big"" issue that Scapeshift has here as well. When you have enough lands in play to make Animist's Awakening good, you might as well just win the game instead."

With amulet decks it pretty much just doubles your mana minus one on a single turn, which usually wins the game right there.   Edit: Disregard. I thought it searched out lands, not dig X."
magicTCG,3dyfbc,khanfusion,9,Mon Jul 20 16:49:59 2015 UTC,"Alright so assuming you're generating 6 or 7 mana, which is normal if you haven't already won the game and need more lands, this looks 5-6 cards down. Which on average gives you a bit closer to 2 than 3 lands. I'd rather slam a primeval titan or a hive mind."

magicTCG,3dyfbc,PM_ME_UR_HUGS,16,Mon Jul 20 17:17:21 2015 UTC,"The problem is that because it only gains vigilance and doesn't naturally have it, you won't be able to produce mana until turn 3. That's just too slow, especially the times you can't play it on turn 1."
magicTCG,3dyfbc,CountryCaravan,13,Mon Jul 20 17:24:01 2015 UTC,I attack with my 2/2 vigilance on turn 3!   I block with my Courser of Kruphix.

magicTCG,3dyfbc,Filth_,10,Mon Jul 20 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"I think the card would have been good, if it had vigilance to start with, so you can attack on turn 2, get it renown and then tap for mana."

magicTCG,3dyfbc,w00tthehuk,3,Mon Jul 20 17:55:23 2015 UTC,"And that's why I suggest that, had it been a common, it would be awesome in Pauper.  Pauper could use a one-drop color fixer, but it would have to have a sufficient downside to be common-worthy.  Honored Hierarch's downside is enough (though I might take away Vigilance--requiring that it get a hit in before it can be used for color-fixing ensures that it's vulnerable and doesn't add too much power to ramp strategies, as after T2, this card is completely unplayable).  The problem is that it's just too complicated of a card to be printable at common under the current design rules."

Generally, you want more consistency, so get rid of your 1 & 2-of's and add more 4-ofs of more impactful cards.  Why have Leaf Gilder, but not Elvish Mystic? Nightsnare isn't a good card, and I would cut yeva's forcemage as well."

And if you're playing Sylvan Messenger, you should cut the Mana Gorger. Maybe add in an overrun type effect as an alternate win-con? And possibly Gilt-Leaf Winnower on the top end. Nissa can also be a win-con as well."
magicTCG,3e2j46,Pustka,2,Tue Jul 21 14:06:40 2015 UTC,Why do you want to make it just out of Origins cards? If its standard you're just making your deck inherently weaker.

If you can't afford/find the collected company that's not such an issue but some of the cards in your list such as [[Eyeblight Assassin]] and [[Yeva's Forcemage]] are good and fun in limited but not so much a constructed format like modern.  Also 4x [[Sylvan Messenger]] is an absolute must.

magicTCG,3e2j46,MTGCardFetcher,2,Tue Jul 21 15:38:41 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've finished building.  Things to note:   4x [[Gnarlroot Trapper]].  Protects Dwynen (by giving her deathtouch during declare attackers), punches holes in your opponent's board (by giving other creatures deathtouch during blocks) 4x [[Shaman of the Pack]]: A burn spell with a respectable body 3x [[Nissa, Vastwood Seer]] (the most expensive card in the mainboard): In the early game, she ensures you hit your land drops.  In the late game, she ensures you don't topdeck a land. [[Elvish Mystic]] > Leaf Gilder. 4x [[Elvish Visionary]] (not just 2--you want dat card draw) 4x [[Sylvan Messenger]]: dat card draw [[Chord of Calling]]: get any card from your deck, even before declaring blockers. [[Collected Company]]: flood the board on your opponent's turn [[Windswept Heath]] and [[Polluted Delta]] (Polluted Delta is also pricey): if you bring Nissa in on Collected Company or Chord of Calling on your opponent's turn while you control 7 lands, crack one and flip her for value. [[Urborg]]: You don't want to take pain from those Llanowar Wastes. [[Gilt-Leaf Winnower]]: Kills [[Siege Rhino]] dead.   Things in your deck that aren't good:   Eyeblight Assassin: No, it's not a 2/2.  It's a 1/2 that pings your opponent when you attack.  It trades unfavorably. Thornbow Archer: This isn't sealed/draft.  You can't count on this. Yeva's Forcemage: overcosted for the ETB effect Your enchantments and sorceries aren't helping you.  Get rid of them, except Eyeblight Massacre.  That card belongs here. Managorger Hydra: you want more elves to fuel Sylvan Messenger. Might of the Masses: worse than [[Jorga Invocation]].  If you want this effect, [[Obelisk of Urd]] is actually your best bet. Deadbrige Shaman: Overcosted for the discard effect.   Things I'm unsure about in my deck:   [[Sword of the Animist]]: It thins the deck, and equipping it to creature!Nissa is a flavor win, but I'm not 100% sold on it.   Things you don't have:   A sideboard.  You get 15 cards.  [[Eyeblight Massacre]] is a good choice, as it wipes out tokens, goblins, and thopters while keeping your board alive.  [[Thoughtseize]] (most expensive card in the 75 because it's played in every format) deals with troublesome cards that you can't remove.  [[Hero's Downfall]] stops things like [[Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver]] and [[Ugin, the Spirit Dragon]] from wrecking your shit.  [[Bile Blight]] is more anti-token insurance.  [[Reclamation Sage]] removes enchantments and artifacts."

I don't know how their disciplinary system works but they could lose WOTC backing if they are found to be doing sketchy things, especially if they are level(I think that's the term) store.  If that happens, you most likely won't be welcome in the store... I wouldn't go back regardless and would blast them on social media. The other option is printing out the rule and taking it there and calling wizards in front of them. You may get your prize and that point.    I've been in that scenario in my store when I first started going. The ""rules guy"" (who was an employee) told me I was wrong. I grabbed my iPhone, pulled up the rule and called him out.

magicTCG,3dw58x,Branch3s,105,Mon Jul 20 02:01:29 2015 UTC,"Before you do any of this, you should point out the specific rules text that applies and see if you can resolve this one on one."

Sure we know they may not have done but they still get to garner sympathy by saying that of course they would have done.  And really, who knows? Maybe they did call WotC but described the situation inaccurately by mistake leading to the ""wrong"" decision, and would actually be rather happy to make it right?"

What's the point in jumping down every company/persons throat with accusations of ""this is  so deliberate. It's bullshit. You're trying to scam me. You're out to get me.""? Mistakes do happen and they happen way more regularly than employees actually being out to get people.   It's still possible that they made a mistake in their description of the event to WotC or some other miscommunication, so take down the rule number and show them. Personally I just always try and give people a chance to make things right on their own before going all social media smear campaign on them.

Heck one time my friend and I went in to sit at a table and play commander, and we got scolded by him because we were using up his store's space.

magicTCG,3dw58x,deathbyrats,5,Mon Jul 20 08:43:11 2015 UTC,"The store I go to kinda does it.  They charge if you want to use their gaming space while a tournament is going on, and also don't allow spectators, unless it is the guardian of a younger kid.  Their reasoning is that the other people in that space paid to be their, so it isn't fair for you to not pay as well.  Plus at the time they made the rule, it was getting close to being an issue for space.  They also give away a pack at the end to everyone who paid, tournament or not, as well as let you in on a raffle at the end for more stuff."
magicTCG,3dw58x,GornSpelljammer,3,Mon Jul 20 12:17:58 2015 UTC,"That sounds less like ""charging to spectate"" and more of a ""cover charge"", though, so that situation seems reasonable."

He should be able to tell from there if he was officially disqualified.  If they entered in the other person as the winner that would add more to their list of wrongdoings.

While everyone can do it, you will have to enter a disqualification report on judge.wizards.com, and I doubt that any of the people involved (by their lack of rules knowledge) know that this is the case.  This is probably just a TO banning the player from the store, which he has every right to do for any reason.  Don't just let this fade into nothing, contact WotC and make them deal with the store.

magicTCG,3dw58x,Hamroids,5,Mon Jul 20 06:12:28 2015 UTC,Heck yea.... Some many goddamn rules in this game!
magicTCG,3dw58x,SnipingBeaver,2,Mon Jul 20 09:44:02 2015 UTC,"Never be afraid to call a judge for a ruling! It's not a bad manners or rude thing to do, it's their primary service as a judge. Ask specific questions, though, as they can only tell you oracle text, rules, etc but can't give you advice."
magicTCG,3dw58x,tetsuooooooooooo,10,Mon Jul 20 13:07:31 2015 UTC,"Might be a bit of a noob question, but does the end of 112.7a (The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.) mean that a creature that has the ability ""Tap: [This creature] does 1 damage to target opponent."" can activate its ability, get killed before the ability resolves, then have the ability resolve and still do 1 damage even though the creature (who is doing the damage) is in the grave?"
magicTCG,3dw58x,Jondare,19,Mon Jul 20 09:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, abilities go into the stack"
magicTCG,3dw58x,YellowF3v3r,11,Mon Jul 20 09:55:57 2015 UTC,"Maybe noteworthy exception here is monstrous. You can monstrous Polukranos, but if he gets killed before the monstrous trigger resolves then he deals no dmg. That's because it says ""if it becomes monstrous, it deals x dmg"" and it only becomes monstrous upon resolution of the monstrous trigger."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Hamroids,10,Mon Jul 20 15:15:06 2015 UTC,"Yup! There is effectively no way to stop an activated ability with a removal spells, unless the creatures removed is the only valid target of the ability, in which case it fizzles. The other cases are the OPs, where you activate, they kill in response, but except for very niche cases the ability still does its thing, or they kill, and you then activate in response.   Best way to think of it is that the creature casts a spell: as soon as it has tapped or whatever costs there is, the spell is cast. Even if you kill the caster, the spell is ready active, flying towards its goal."
magicTCG,3dw58x,lewisw1992,9,Mon Jul 20 11:14:43 2015 UTC,"Yep, it was explained to me like, if a soldier throws a grenade and then gets shot in the head, the grenade still explodes. :D"

We know abilities resolved even with their source gone, but always assumed that if it was the creature doing the damage, it still had to be on the field. Thanks! [="
magicTCG,3dw58x,colacadstink,3,Mon Jul 20 16:42:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, killing a creature does not stop the activated ability from resolving, hence the dispute by OP."
magicTCG,3dw58x,steamBommer29,4,Mon Jul 20 10:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yup. The few exceptions have an intervening ""if"" clause, like ""if this is on the battlefield"" that is checked when the ability tries to resolve. But if there's no intervening if, the ability resolves no matter what put it on the stack and where that originating object is now."
magicTCG,3dw58x,chaosof99,34,Mon Jul 20 13:11:37 2015 UTC,"That's an outdated version of that document; the newest one is here, and you can always find the newest one here.   It's still rule 112.7a though."

magicTCG,3dw58x,kapol,51,Mon Jul 20 01:21:41 2015 UTC,"They might nvestigate the store, and the store's relationship with wotc could be put into jeopardy if Wizards finds your story to hold water. My gut instinct is that Wizards won't take lightly to this kind of thing."
magicTCG,3dw58x,towishimp,13,Mon Jul 20 01:25:23 2015 UTC,Also letting the store know about the live judgechat is an easy way to get correct impartial rulings. There's a link in the sidebar.

Or have them conference call Wizards with your friend present...that'd be good for a laugh."
magicTCG,3dw58x,xavierkiath,205,Mon Jul 20 01:36:34 2015 UTC,"Any Level 1 judge or even any serious tournament player knows the answer to this ""rules question.""  That they got it wrong is a joke.  That they DQ'ed your friend is insane.    I don't think it's even up to 'serious tournament player' knowledge. If you have even a basic knowledge of how priority/the stack works, this is an easy situation to understand. Even if the opponent could cast Doom Blade before the ability was activated, ""Jake"" (from the original thread) could activate the ability in response anyways."
magicTCG,3dw58x,arealllama,139,Mon Jul 20 01:55:58 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It's such a basic rules question that I'm inclined to think that they must be deliberately trying to screw OP's friend over.
magicTCG,3dw58x,kapol,56,Mon Jul 20 02:11:02 2015 UTC,Inclined?  It's pretty obvious that it was completely intentional.
magicTCG,3dw58x,Little_Gray,32,Mon Jul 20 03:00:05 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say obvious. You might be amazed at the number of casual players who don't understand the stack.
magicTCG,3dw58x,xavierkiath,44,Mon Jul 20 04:07:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they said they called wizards."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Sensei_Ochiba,18,Mon Jul 20 04:26:11 2015 UTC,"That could be them lying to cover for their laziness rather than malice. Or maybe they did call Wizards... but what is Wizard's customer help supposed to do? If the person who answers actually knows the rules to start, there's still the issue of the owner possibly describing it wrong.   It's something I could easily attribute to stupidity rather than scumbag behavior. But it does make things significantly more sketchy."
magicTCG,3dw58x,poohshoes,16,Mon Jul 20 04:41:03 2015 UTC,There is also the issue that you dont call Wizard's about ruling questions.
magicTCG,3dw58x,lordofthejungle,10,Mon Jul 20 05:57:15 2015 UTC,"Right, and not all of wizards staff knows the stack either. He said he called, not who he talked to. A general customer service rep might have been more trained for D&D service and messed up MTG rules, or the store owner may have stated the question in a way that seems accurate to him but led to an incorrect ruling. I'm just saying give them the benefit of the doubt until you know exactly what happened on the call."
magicTCG,3dw58x,electricfistula,6,Mon Jul 20 04:39:44 2015 UTC,"""Benefit of the doubt"" still says they were in the wrong, just that it may not have been intentional. Malice or laziness notwithstanding, the rules as written are not what happened, and regardless, they came with an agreement to proceed and he got DQ's afterwords."
magicTCG,3dw58x,lordofthejungle,11,Mon Jul 20 06:02:34 2015 UTC,Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.
magicTCG,3dw58x,electricfistula,11,Mon Jul 20 05:12:59 2015 UTC,"The reason that's inappropriate to the situation is the phrase uses the qualifier 'adequately' and there are parts of OP's account not adequately explained by stupidity. In this case as it has been recounted there is actually wilful negligence to the point of malice.  Persisting with a rules query is not a DQ-able offense, nor is arguing in favour of an alternative ruling or interpretation of the rules. It can't be a DQ-able offense in any game. Games just wouldn't exist as a concept in that world.   Yet the TO lead with an unwarranted threat to DQ in the initial rules dispute despite admitting to needing to confirm them. That's coercive. If they are just being stupid about the rules, it doesn't mean that they are not being mean, it means they're being stupid and mean.  If OP is just wrong or lying, there's still nothing we can tell them that will get anyone in trouble so I feel there's nothing to be gained by adopting your position."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Alexjamesrook,9,Mon Jul 20 11:18:42 2015 UTC,"Another option is that OP somehow misunderstood whatever was happening, or that what the store thinks happened, and OP thinks happened, are quite different."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Little_Gray,5,Mon Jul 20 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"Well that's a pointless position, OP's done nothing to warrant suspicion and can't somehow misuse the information we're giving him to malicious ends either way.   We can only advise OP based on the case they presented and probe as best we can - which some people have done and it has shown OP has a pretty lucid understanding of what happened if nothing else. Based on OP's account, the store is coercing players out of DCI events with threats of DQs over ruling challenges. If the reality is not in line with OP's account of events, then OP still has done nothing wrong and still isn't going to be advised to act in a way that is actualy harmful to anyone."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Sensei_Ochiba,3,Mon Jul 20 11:38:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting that OP is acting maliciously. A misunderstanding is a possible interpretation of the events in the OP.  I made this comment in reply to someone claiming that the store must be trying to screw OP over.  Not so, this whole thing may be a misunderstanding."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Skithiryx,17,Mon Jul 20 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"I can testify that no one at my LGS knows how priority works.  Funny one I heard a couple weeks ago, the active player puts the ""end of phase"" on the stack and the opponent gets the chance to respond to it.  I swear I'm going to bring the entire turn order chapter in one weekend..."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Piogre,11,Mon Jul 20 03:36:46 2015 UTC,Well that seems less like them not knowing what priority is and more like them not knowing the difference between abilities and how you move between phases.
magicTCG,3dw58x,ZGiSH,8,Mon Jul 20 04:16:01 2015 UTC,"Which, to be fair, is completely dependant on priority."
magicTCG,3dw58x,chaosof99,5,Mon Jul 20 05:59:16 2015 UTC,"While that's wrong in the details that actually seems like a pretty good way to explain it to a novice without explaining priority rules.  Actually, The only thing I can think of as an divergence from the truth is that the active player will get priority on the empty stack again if the non-active player takes an action while they have priority. In their version they would probably be misled into thinking they couldn't cast sorceries any more."
magicTCG,3dw58x,fmal,10,Mon Jul 20 07:32:40 2015 UTC,"I'm a crappy casual player, and I knew this within my first few games.  The stack is not complicated."
magicTCG,3dw58x,notaballoon,4,Mon Jul 20 05:34:35 2015 UTC,"The fact is that it's a fundamental part of the game, if it didn't work like this, effects that have a sacrifice cost just straight up don't work."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Alexm920,6,Mon Jul 20 12:49:30 2015 UTC,"Easiest explanation ever: Just show them the card ""Seal of Fire"" or any other other card that sacrifices itself for an effect. Just because the source of the effect is no longer on the battlefield doesn't mean the effect doesn't happen."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Wraithpk,4,Mon Jul 20 12:36:44 2015 UTC,They definitely knew and were just trying to pull a swindle on this kid and his friend.
magicTCG,3dw58x,gualdhar,137,Mon Jul 20 05:15:14 2015 UTC,"The ruling aside, it is absolutely unacceptable for them to DQ your friend for adhering to a judge ruling. He didn't do anything wrong: if they judge makes an incorrect call, that's on the judge, not the player who benefited from the ruling."
magicTCG,3dw58x,shamonic,21,Mon Jul 20 02:27:07 2015 UTC,"This is actually the part that bothers me the most. If the on-site judge makes an incorrect call, then it's not the player's fault. Absolute madness."
magicTCG,3dw58x,xavierkiath,182,Mon Jul 20 15:21:55 2015 UTC,Did they not have a judge on hand to answer that?  That's a pretty simple interaction.  I have a hard time seeing how people playing modern could be unaware that an activated ability still resolves even if the creature is killed in response.  The whole story is really weird.
magicTCG,3dw58x,shamonic,61,Mon Jul 20 01:25:04 2015 UTC,"It's not just modern, this happens in standard a lot too. You can play a kill spell in response to a planeswalker or creature ability, but the ability is still there on the stack, and still happens unless the target is no longer legal. Any control player worth his salt in any format will know this."
magicTCG,3dw58x,gualdhar,85,Mon Jul 20 01:48:23 2015 UTC,"my time tested analogy:  If a soldier throws a grenade, then gets shot- does his grenade go off?  Yes, as long as he didn't miss."
magicTCG,3dw58x,xavierkiath,58,Mon Jul 20 03:19:42 2015 UTC,"Well, to be accurate, his grenade goes off even if he misses."
magicTCG,3dw58x,Little_Gray,45,Mon Jul 20 03:34:30 2015 UTC,"shhhhh, don't worry- analogies are like metaphors- better when mixed thoroughly.  or was that cocktails, hell- six drinks in I don't know anything anymore."
magicTCG,3dw58x,tickle-me-azathoth,14,Mon Jul 20 03:38:06 2015 UTC,"Well if we want to make it more accurate... The grenade goes off, then you check if anyone was in the blast."

magicTCG,3dw58x,MTGCardFetcher,38,Mon Jul 20 07:01:40 2015 UTC,I just say that because Modern is generally a more complex format than Standard or limited.  I can't believe these people are playing Modern and don't understand that very basic interaction.
magicTCG,3dw58x,BrokenHS,6,Mon Jul 20 01:59:23 2015 UTC,"Depending on the size of the LGS, it very well could be the case. About 6 years ago (around 2009), I went to a small LGS fairly frequently. Magic wasn't incredibly popular in my town. I went to a Legacy tournament with a homebrewed burn deck and included multiple copies of [[Book Burning]] in my deck completely misunderstanding the card in an almost embarrassing way. In a Legacy tournament.  Surprisingly, my deck didn't do too terribly. I didn't place, but I didn't outright lose all my games either.  People new to formats can completely misunderstand a lot of things, especially if their LGS doesn't provide good guidance."
magicTCG,3dw58x,jsweet4979,5,Mon Jul 20 06:13:15 2015 UTC,"I think I can guess your misunderstanding. The first time I had that card played against me I thought it was so unfair. ""I don't have Book Burning myself so I have to take six and mill six?"""

The rules say it can still deal the damage regardless but that's not something that is immediately obvious."
magicTCG,3dw58x,HardlyNewABU,8,Mon Jul 20 05:58:29 2015 UTC,"Well it is when you understand the rules about activated abilities, which everyone playing in tournaments should.  Basically:    Pay the cost, which is everything left of the colon.  The effect is put on the stack Stack resolves as normal.   Once you pay the cost the effect is going to go off, unless there aren't any valid targets. (Or unless some clown is playing Stifle or that one morph creature)"

That said, the truly egregious part of what they did here was DQing someone for being wrong about the rules (which they were not, in this case).  Incorrect rules knowledge is not a DQable offense at any REL, that's the point of a judge, to arbitrate and act as an impartial 3rd party.  In this case, it seems like the 3rd party was not only not impartial, but downright wrong.  To DQ someone because they don't know the rules is exactly the kind of behaviour that needs to be reprimanded in some way.  Unacceptable."

Getting DQ'd from a regular REL event with anything short of intentionally cheating or getting abusive is difficult. Getting DQ'd for nobody at the place knowing the rules is flat-out stupid. Especially when it's honestly a pretty simple interaction (comparatively for this game) that has no real way of working out as Not Jake wanted to start with.

You are right that it is total BS but its also something that Wizards takes extremely seriously.  Any store caught doing that would literally not be able to ever run a sanctioned magic tournament again and would be cut off from every getting any magic product from wizards.

First, when the disagreement started, somebody at the same table as you would overheard and set the other guy straight on this VERY basic rules question.  Second, if you did call a judge, they'd get it right.  Third, if somehow there was still magically confusion over it by the end of the night, they wouldn't try and sketch you out, they'd just hand out the prizes and move on.  And fourth, even if somehow they DID decide to be all sketchy AND get everything wrong, they would still not DQ you for being wrong on a rules question.  This is such a bizarre set of circumstances, I wouldn't even worry about it.  Apparently this LGS just sucks."

I stopped him as I had a [[scavenging ooze]] out and would have exiled the tutor in response. The judge told me he started searching so it resolved and I should've stopped him earlier, and he got a game-winning card while I would've won the next turn.

And even so, I am about 99.99999% certain that even if he went all the way to the form to DQ your friend, as soon as the investigation committee looks at it, they're going to throw it out and make no further recourse. As for how to follow up on this, use the various contacts that have been listed here.

If I throw a grenade at you, and then you shoot me in the head, the grenade still goes off. Now if the grenade was a magical grenade that makes me stronger, but I'm dead it has no effect. But if it's a grenade to blow you up, shooting me does nothing and it still blows up. The TO was wrong, show him the official rules and if he doesn't understand then try to explain it to him. If he refuses to understand I'd say go to a different LGS if possible. There's no way he called wizards and they would have gotten that rule wrong. Also at Regular REL there's no way a DQ is justified and that can't be considered cheating. If it's a smaller LGS it probably means the other guy is more of a regular than you or friends with someone/the TO and so they argue in his favor. This can happen a lot at a smaller LGS."

magicTCG,3dya6s,ValuablePie,58,Mon Jul 20 14:57:43 2015 UTC,"There are lots of people arguing about the ruling, but they missed the question.  The answer is - whatever the Head Judge rules is how it works for the tournament unless specifically overridden by the same HJ later. Judges are human; mistakes happen. But, their ruling stands.  In a tournament with a Head Judge and Floor Judges, you have the right to appeal to the Head Judge. Their word remains final."
magicTCG,3dya6s,tobyelliott,14,Mon Jul 20 16:47:09 2015 UTC,"In a situation like this at a small event with only 1 judge, how would you advise letting the judge know he made the wrong ruling?  Should we bring up the official ruling on our phone/other devise and show the judge?  Let the ruling stand and talk to the judge after the fact?  It seems awkward to just let a clearly incorrect ruling stand because ""the judge said so."""
magicTCG,3dya6s,Cygnal37,18,Mon Jul 20 17:17:07 2015 UTC,"If you can quickly show a reference to an official ruling, like the Origins FAQ or the gatherer page for the card, that's fine. This should be enough for the judge to change his ruling. If you are unable to do so on the spot, you can contact the judge later and show how he was mistaken. Hopefully this causes him to apologize and consider double checking the next time.  It's awkward when rulings are made incorrectly, but it's necessary to let local game stores arrange tournaments even without a certified judge. This is why competitive tournaments where tournament integrity is more important require judges of a specific level, for example a GPT require a lvl 1 judge and a PPTQ require a lvl 2 judge."
magicTCG,3dya6s,rabbitlion,18,Mon Jul 20 17:56:48 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this.  Though, I'll note that certification is not a panacea here. All judges make mistakes on occasion. It happens. But, ultimately, each tournament needs a final authority, and that authority is the Head Judge."

magicTCG,3dya6s,Little_Gray,10,Mon Jul 20 20:22:33 2015 UTC,Nothing. You accept the ruling and move on. Maybe later you have a chat with them. That's what it means to be final authority.

Head judge gives the final ruling, if you can quickly show them a ruling source they may change their ruling.

magicTCG,3dya6s,Isawa_Chuckles,41,Mon Jul 20 21:12:25 2015 UTC,"Before every Prerelease, Wizards publishes the Release Notes, which includes specific card information.    Tragic Arrogance: If a permanent has more than one of the affected types, it can count for any of them. For example, you could choose an artifact creature as the artifact you're sparing, another creature as the creature, and an enchantment creature as the enchantment. Similarly, you could choose an enchantment creature as both the creature and the enchantment that you're sparing, even if the player controls another creature and/or another enchantment.   The Judge should have referred to this page if he/she wasn't sure about the actual card. When you felt the ruling was wrong you could have shown them his page. There's nothing you can do to correct that match/event now, but you can bring this forward to the Judge/Store Owner in question and let them know. For future prereleases, be sure to give that set's release notes a thorough read and have the link handy on your phone, or even print it out to have on hand.  Magic Origins Release Notes"
magicTCG,3dya6s,SquirrelDragon,30,Mon Jul 20 15:03:20 2015 UTC,Show him the ruling that's right on the gatherer page. I'm amazed this person is a judge at all if everything happened as you say.
magicTCG,3dya6s,_neurotoxin_,10,Mon Jul 20 14:59:28 2015 UTC,The judge was busy at another event and probably didn't commit much thought to this. I think it's unlikely that he's incompetent.
magicTCG,3dya6s,OnWingsOfShadow,36,Mon Jul 20 15:06:50 2015 UTC,I'd argue that not taking 3 seconds to look up the Gatherer page for a card you're not familiar with is incompetence.

EDIT: Wow I'm actually surprised by the downvotes...  from the dozens of rules questions I get asked during an event, I'm expected to go to gatherer each and every time? 99% of the time there's no reason to check.

Not only does it undermine players' confidence in their knowledge, but it also leads to insane numbers of long time extensions, which affect everyone.  Sure, check it if you need to, but a good judge should be able to issue rulings on cards they are not familiar with. I know what maybe 10% of the cards in standard do, but it doesn't affect my ability to issue accurate rulings."

Since you draw cards as part of the spell, you'd trigger Tutelage multiple times.  And those triggers would wait until next priority to go onto the stack.  The ""End this turn"" steps didn't include anything that would stop those triggers, since they weren't objects yet.  After the rules update: They clarified that the triggers that trigger but didn't go on the stack yet go away.

If someone posted a thread every time a judge got a ruling correct, I think you'd see that almost all judges get almost all rulings right, almost all of the time.  It's similar to the Modern Masters packaging issue - people posted their goofy boxes of all the same foil or scratched cards or missing rares, but at GP Vegas, where we opened pallet after pallet of the stuff, we had hardly any errors - I don't think a single draft pod in the Kiki-Jiki Day 2 needed a pack replaced.  Don't let a few sensational outliers make you think that there's a trend."
magicTCG,3dya6s,nerdyfanboy1,2,Mon Jul 20 19:42:00 2015 UTC,I had a level 2 judge rule that my opponent can cast an instant at ANY time. Meaning I'm in my main phase thinking about my play and he can lightning bolt me.
magicTCG,3dya6s,SuperWackSauce,2,Mon Jul 20 19:25:12 2015 UTC,"why is this a problem?  Edit: conclusions.  Planeswalker abilities are sorceries, not instants, so this is necessary for them to be able to play safely. It also sees a buff to countering over removal.   loyalty counters are added or removed as a cost. the counters will be added before you have priority  ""BransonKP""  What it really does is prevent infinite stalls (based on instant versus instant potential casts) both myself and ""CapeMonkey"""

magicTCG,3dya6s,SuperWackSauce,-4,Mon Jul 20 22:52:29 2015 UTC,"i didn't realize that instants didn't have instant priority, that's confusing at best. I find myself failing to see a case where casting an instant during main phase is in any way game altering (save perhaps the 1 less mana they may have laid down)   we are talking about something that could've been cast at any point prior."
magicTCG,3dya6s,Lati0s,4,Mon Jul 20 22:57:36 2015 UTC,One case where it could matter is if they have a planeswealker at 3 loyalty and you want to lightning bolt it. the active player has priority o they get to use a + ability before it can be bolted.
magicTCG,3dya6s,SuperWackSauce,-3,Mon Jul 20 23:00:45 2015 UTC,"but, again, you could've just done it earlier. additionally, abilities act as instants (typically unstoppable if i'm not mistaken, such that they always go to completion regardless) so i still don't see how casting a bolt on main phase effects this.  they cast you use the ability under the cast and then spend your loyalty again under the cast."
magicTCG,3dya6s,Lati0s,5,Mon Jul 20 23:05:37 2015 UTC,Not if the walker was just played and walker abilities are like sorceries
magicTCG,3dya6s,SuperWackSauce,-1,Mon Jul 20 23:39:17 2015 UTC,but couldn't i just interrupt the cast of the planeswalkers ability with the lightning prior to getting to use the extra point?
magicTCG,3dya6s,BransonKP,4,Tue Jul 21 00:04:23 2015 UTC,"I think one piece of the puzzle you're missing with that logic is that abilities resolve independent of their sources. If I want to use [[Garruk, Wildspeaker]]s -1 ability during my main phase, and you bolt him in response, I'll still get my 3/3 Beast after the stack resolves.  You were asking why it matters what order spells occur during the main phase. Imagine my Garruk is sitting at 3 loyalty during my main phase, and I know you have a Lightning Bolt. Because I have priority first, I can choose to use his +1 ability, placing a loyalty counter on him, before passing priority to you. In this way, I've prevented Garruk from dying to your bolt."
magicTCG,3dya6s,nerdyfanboy1,2,Tue Jul 21 00:19:40 2015 UTC,No. If I cast a planeswalker and you let it resolve. I hold priority. You can't bolt before I do anything. If I do anything besides play a land. Then you can respond with the bolt. But otherwise I have priority.

Still, stores computer has wired internet, that point stands no matter what, unless the event started and there was immediately a power outage or something, ontop of a store being like my LGS and just killing wifi upon entry, and it's also too cold to reasonably ask anyone to go check for you outside."

I've been wrong a number of times, but not near as often as I've seen players insist that I'm wrong.  Once a ruling is made, you can appeal that ruling to the head judge, or continue playing. Once the head judge makes a ruling, it's time to continue playing. You can bring up additional information (""I think that I saw a Gatherer note on this...""), but continuing to argue is just being disruptive to the event. In some cases, a judge might be able to humor you, but I can think of a lot more cases where a player was wrong and continued to argue than cases where the player was right, and at some point, you've got to get the match moving again.   As a player, if you feel that an incorrect ruling was made by the head judge, speak to him or her about it after your match - one of you will learn something from the experience without disrupting the event further."

Even a lot of experienced players don't know/won't recall that there is an ""end combat"" step that occurs after damage.  There's a reason that pretty much everybody in their set review pointed out that you could do this with [[Celestial Flare]], because it's not at all obvious.  That said, both of these examples were things that were widely discussed when the set was spoiled, exactly because they are important-but-counterintuitive interactions.  Not all players can be compulsive redditors, heh, but an LGS ought to have at least one person on hand who is embedded enough into the community to have read about both of these interactions."

If you're super hesitant you could always look for those and then buy the actual book if you think it's worthwhile.  In the end though, it's $37 and while that's not cheap it's not very expensive for a small print run book (I have more issues with the $27/37 they ask for the e-books, that is just excessive)."
magicTCG,3e2mj0,Aethien,3,Tue Jul 21 15:02:32 2015 UTC,It really depends on what you're trying to achieve.  If you're looking for a amazing quick read and win every game then this book isn't for you. You're better off reading articles on CFB or SCG.  However if you're looking for thought experiments and philosophy around the game to improve your thinking about certain situations you may come across in both the game and your life in general then this book is a very good read.  I haven't got far through it but after reading the section about starting a team I'm really reconsidering how we (as a team) are approaching tournaments. Would recommended if you are willing to buy.

magicTCG,3e2vy6,bautin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:30:59 2015 UTC,"Fun facts alert!   Fun fact 1: your forests can only tap for green mana because they are forests. If they were to lose the subtype, they would also lose the ability to tap for green. Same I they were to gain a land type.   A good example of this is to look at the ravnica shocks vs the guild gates. [[golgari guildgate]] has an ability. [[overgrown tomb]] just has reminder text and can tap for mana by virtue of being a swamp and a forest.   Fun fact 2: basic land types are the only subtypes that bring additional rules or abilities to the card.   Many many years ago, two other sub types had rules. Wall and legend.   By virtue of being a wall creature type, you had defender. This was later errata, manually giving all walls defender.   Legend used to be a creature subtype, not the super type it is today. It came with the old legend rule keeping anyone from having a second copy of a legend on the board.   The legend rule was changed during kamikawa block to allow a use for your legendaries. If anyone played a second legend, they would all die. This made clone effects very powerful.   Then, during m14 release, the legend rule was changed to what it is today. This was before theros and the gods. Wotc wanted players to be able to play with their gods instead of using them as removal.   Fun facts over!"

magicTCG,3dxtvp,Pravinoz,5,Mon Jul 20 15:14:40 2015 UTC,"In Standard, sure! Other formats, probably not. If Modern Burn has to start throwing its damage spells at creatures, it's in a bad spot anyway (Searing Blaze nonwithstanding)."
magicTCG,3dxtvp,hawkshaw1024,2,Mon Jul 20 15:21:39 2015 UTC,"I was just think about this earlier and thought it would be cool if the spell did 3 damage normally, and 4 with spell mastery.  Still only to creatures, but much stronger at handling on board threats"

magicTCG,3dxtvp,Cishet_Shitlord,32,Mon Jul 20 13:54:39 2015 UTC,They needed to give him vigilance as a base ability (before it gets renown). This way if you are lucky enough to play it turn 1 and hit turn 2 it actually ramps immediately. Not ramping until turn 3 after jumping through hoops is just awful.
magicTCG,3dxtvp,Wizard_Lettuce,8,Mon Jul 20 14:38:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this would have been the only change he'd need to be decent. They must have tested this and found it too good? Heck if I know."
magicTCG,3dxtvp,quillypen,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:19 2015 UTC,"They weren't making a Birds of Paradise. They were making a small green Renown creature. Thinking of it as just an aggressive creature that can do something later on when it can't break through anymore is a much better way of viewing the card. Still doesn't mean it's good, but not all rares are meant to be good.  Remember that Standard design is as a cohesive unit. The power of 3 and 4 mana spells need to be balanced around whether there's a good 1 mana accelerant in the format, like Elvish Mystic. How much better is a given card played on turn 2 versus turn 3? If it's significantly better and a mana dork is in standard, that card isn't going to be costed at 3 mana anymore, or printed at all, necessarily. So not having a dork to accelerate on turn 1 means we can get more pushed 3 and 4 drops."
magicTCG,3dxtvp,mjschul16,15,Tue Jul 21 03:56:15 2015 UTC,"I wonder if it was OP somehow, and there was a last-minute change to make it not horribly OP.  I mean, my god, it's the face of a clash pack, and it's unplayable.  And it's not unplayable because it's some big splashy monster that costs too much mana (which totally would make sense as the face of a clash pack).  It's unplayable because it's a little dork that just doesn't actually work the way you want it to.  I gotta figure something didn't go as planned..."
magicTCG,3dxtvp,jsweet4979,8,Mon Jul 20 14:47:50 2015 UTC,"They are experimenting with not having a turn one dork in Standard. I think this is to underline it: here's your 1-drop dork, but it won't ramp you consistently."
magicTCG,3dxtvp,chrisrazor,2,Mon Jul 20 15:14:24 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've got a wild theory for this one...  Take a look at [[Sigil of Valor]].  It kinda works by giving everybody but the equipped creature quasi-Exalted, right?  (It works a little differently than Exalted, but the similarity is pretty clear)  Maybe ORI had a sort of quasi-Exalted subtheme, and Honored Hierarch was supposed to have some kind of quasi-Exalted ability (thus furthering the callout to [[Noble Hierarch]]) but they couldn't fit the rules text and/or it was overpowered, so they had to cut it?  Like let's say it had this rules text:  Whenever a creature you control attacks alone, it gets +1/+1 for each other creature you control.  I would run the hell out of an Honored Hierarch with that line added, wouldn't you?"
magicTCG,3dxtvp,jsweet4979,8,Mon Jul 20 15:17:27 2015 UTC,You want to reprint [[Sublime Archangel]] with lower stats for G? That's busted as hell.

Like if it said ""When Honored Hierarch attacks alone, it gets +1/+1 for each other creature you control"".

magicTCG,3dxtvp,MTGCardFetcher,3,Mon Jul 20 15:17:56 2015 UTC,"I think it is going exactly as WOTC planned. If you look at all of the low cmc mana producers in standard right now, you quickly see that the trend is pushing towards 4 mana on turn 3, rather than the traditional 3 mana on turn 2. Cards that buck this trend like Elvish Mystic, Satyr Hedonist, Generator Servant, and Gnarlroot trapper are actually in the minority and, other than Mystic, ramp at some additional cost. The large majority of creatures or enchantments (even in blue now!) don't give a mana boost until turn three or later. Even though there is a comparatively ""small"" design space for dorks, not every one can be like Sylvan Caryatid; limited aside, if you push too much you get Noble Hierarch or Deathrite Shaman, push too little and you get Rattleclaw Mystic or Gyre Sage. While the latter two are great cards and have huge mana producing potential, they both suffer from being too slow in hitting the ground. Honored Hierarch is WOTC's concession towards green mages for wanting an awesome one drop (vs goblins, soldiers, or duress cards) while still reigning in the mana for turn 3 and providing ""tricky"" combat scenarios by letting them have a bear sized dork. It lets them figure out if the ""problem"" is waiting an extra turn for the mana or not being able to put the creature down early. Whether or not players actually want this is yet to be seen, but when m15 rotates out, I think many people will realize how ""useful"" having a cmc1 dork is with no other options."
magicTCG,3dxtvp,Pravinoz,6,Mon Jul 20 16:03:09 2015 UTC,"The fact that it can't tap for mana until T3 gets rid of most of the advantages of it being a 1-cmc dork.  Okay, sure, I guess you can still curve out perfectly and get the unblocked T2 hit in with Hierarch, but now we're getting into magical christmas land -- and it's MCL where the Christmas present is a mana dork that comes down a turn early?  I dunno, that still seems pretty weak.  And again, if it weren't the face of a clash pack, I'd just figure it was a bad rare.  Heliod knows there are bad rares (which is fine, not every card can be great).  But as the face of a clash pack, it's just weird.  The face card of these sort of entry-level decks is supposed to be something that makes Timmy go ""zomg I want to cast that!""  Like, a perfect example is my six-year-old son's favorite card: His foil [[Heroes' Bane]] from whatever intro deck that was in.  It's not a great card, but the idea of a card that doubles in size every turn makes my son go bananas.  That card was all he talked about for like a week and a half (even to people who don't play Magic, hahahaha).  Now let me go try and explain Honored Hierarch to my six-year-old.  He's going to shrug.  In fairness, he would probably also shrug at Noble Hierarch -- but you see my point.  Honored Hierarch is bad and boring to a six-year-old.  So why is it on the front of a clash pack?  That's just weird..."
magicTCG,3dxtvp,jsweet4979,3,Mon Jul 20 16:17:02 2015 UTC,"It could be they are trying to appeal to different audiences with the Clash Pack face. Little Tammy gets to go ""ZOMG! A dragon!"" while Spike goes after the Heirarch. The problem is that Heirarch doesn't cut the mustard for Spike.  It makes me wonder if the dorking ability wasn't originally tied to renown or something, so that it was a dork that could turn into a bear if you needed it, or maybe there was more to it than that. They go ahead and commission the art, and then they make the call that they want to slow down ramp in Standard so they made the switch but were stuck with it being the face of the Clash Pack."
magicTCG,3dxtvp,EmpyClaw,2,Mon Jul 20 17:15:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's exactly what I think.  It was supposed to be a better card, then it got nerfed, and it was too late to pick a different Clash Pack face."

If the company that makes Deathtrap had a performance art piece where they had a bunch of mimes publicly take a shit in Times Square and then wipe their asses with photocopies of Wurmcoil Engine, okay, that's probably a ""transformative"" work and does not violate Wizards' copyright.

You begin with Illusions in play, at the beginning of opponents upkeep the trigger to gain control of Illusions occurs, but when it resolves we are past the time when cumulative upkeep would have triggered.

magicTCG,3dxusq,MuraZicu,2,Mon Jul 20 20:30:36 2015 UTC,"Changing control does not ""add"" summoning sickness  This is a fantastic point. Except it's 100% wrong and changing control does add summoning sickness until a player untaps with it. . . . like it says in your post right after.   The post doesn't say at all what part of the turn the ""donate"" happens at.   So for example: ""At the beginning of your upkeep change control of this permanent"" = it donates every turn. It also always has summoning sickness for the rest of the game. Due to it changing control."

magicTCG,3dxusq,sadisticmystic1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:41:52 2015 UTC,It depends when it donates.   Donate could happen at upkeep for example - or it could happen at end step. Two very different results.
magicTCG,3dxusq,MuraZicu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:29 2015 UTC,"Assuming you go first, there is one turn (the very first turn of the game) where it does not change control, and you can attack with it in that one opportunity.  If you don't go first, it will switch on the first turn, as well as every turn after that, and it won't be doing much attacking until some player can give it haste."
magicTCG,3dxusq,MTGCardFetcher,0,Mon Jul 20 20:46:50 2015 UTC,"So that is what I am missing, player 1 has a permanent A player 2 has a permanent B P1 turn 1 controls A-loses summoning sickness,  passes to P2 turn 2, B loses summoning sickness and then gains control of A which doesn't have it. If 1 gains control of B on his first turn then you are correct, however this format is so one sided I don't even want to consider it."

Sultai are dimir/silumgar in their being powerhungry secret-hoarders/controllers, and have the Golgari's love of dead things mixed in.    Mardu have the aggressive but disciplined boros army with a more brutal/chaotic bent borrowed from Rakdos    Temur has their green/blue in the form of a focus on perfection (blue) but focused a lot in physical perfection or shamanistic tradition (both of which tend green) and also have a lot the gruul face-smashed-in philosphy. In this case they're less blue-green as mad science and more a different take on blue-green, making them admittedly the weakest link in this.  That said, the mappings aren't perfect, but then they weren't really designed to be either - they're their own 'clans' that are meant to combine the relevant colours in a way that's not just a re-hash of the guilds."

What are the seriously broken things people are doing in modern without mox diamond, lotus petal, dark ritual, and sol lands?

magicTCG,3e2ep3,Alamoth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:24:30 2015 UTC,I've had a discussion over this with my friends before and the general consensus was that ad nauseam is the best deck ever should this happen. Turn 3 necro sticking around is Gg On turn 4
magicTCG,3e2ep3,silasw,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:30:41 2015 UTC,"The effect of trading life for cards is very powerful. There are clear borders to what makes or breaks one of these cards. Three of these cards are available in Modern today and while two of them are dominant the third one is not:   Griselbrand Dark Confidant Phyrexian Arena   Arena is an interesting one because it shows us a bit of the line between the value of Dark Confidant costing only 2 mana, and providing a creature, compared to Arena's 3-mana cost and lack of combat capabilities. Both cards however are only providing a single extra card per turn, which puts them in a different class than Griselbrand.  Griselbrand shouldn't really be compared to Confidant and Arena. In Modern it is peerless, but in Legacy it could be compared to Necropotence. However, before we consider Necro for Modern, let's consider two other cards with similar effects that are not Modern legal:   Yawgmoth's Bargain Greed   Both of these cards do similar things. They allow you to pay life (and mana in the case of Greed) to draw cards, and they let you do so repeatedly. So let's ask the question, would Greed be too powerful for Modern?  Greed was printed in Legends and is the progenitor of this mechanic. The drawback to Greed is having to both pay mana and pay two life for each card generated. At four mana to cast, would Greed be too powerful for Modern?  Yawgmoth's Bargain and Necropotence are attempts to make a better Greed at the cost of forfeiting your draw step. Necropotence was the first attempt, and the drawbacks added were to lose your draw step, delay the draw effect, and force the casting cost into all-black mana. Yawgmoth's Bargain has the drawback of losing your draw step and costing twice as much mana as Necropotence. Both cards were too powerful for their formats, and are demonstrably more powerful than Greed (otherwise Greed would be served the same treatment in Legacy/Vintage).  So is Greed to powerful for Modern? If you answer that question then it should answer your question about Necropotence."

magicTCG,3e2ep3,Alamoth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:20 2015 UTC,It's not. But what does that tell us about Necro exactly?
magicTCG,3e2ep3,silasw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:49:09 2015 UTC,Why do you think Greed would be okay in Modern?
magicTCG,3e2ep3,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"Well we've got Erebos which sees zero play. Greed's only advantage over that is drawing a card for one less mana. Sure, you can draw a few cards on turn 5, but at a very steep life cost, and you need to tap some mana too. Seems like too much tempo loss and too much risk for too little gain."

I was heading more towards midrange than whip but thought that the whip/tasigur were solid inclusions to work with the rhinos, with the scry lands could i get away with just llanowar wastes or would you also go for the black/white version? if so how many? thanks again (windswept heath is way out of the budget for now im afraid)"
magicTCG,3e1c9k,alcaizin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:21:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't play a ton of standard and am not good at building manabases.  I would look to replace all of the taplands with temples as a start.  You have like three enablers for delve and no fetchlands.  Cut is gonna be hard to cast efficiently more than once earlyish in a game.  That makes four copies not so great.  Downfall trades efficiently with many creatures and hits planeswalkers, which are gonna be tough for you to deal with on a stalled board.  I think that Whip is a good include as a 1-2-of in the main/side of an abzan aggro or midrange deck, but I wouldn't play cards like Hornet Queen unless you're going deeper on the plan."

magicTCG,3e0zmg,scubasteve921,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:02:15 2015 UTC,"I like #3. I can't give advice but could let you know why it appeals to me.  When images with large tonal contrast are being obscured by cards all over the matt, it just leaves a bunch of random shapes that catch the eye but don't mean too much, it's cool to look at before/after games but during it's a bit of a mess.   Landscapes like #3 avoid that by creating a strong focal point that could be visible even when cards are obscuring most of the mat. In addition the larger smooth shapes with less contrast is personally more aesthetically pleasing than a dragon.  That being said, this is one of my favourites. Like #3 the focal point is unlikely to be covered by cards, and leading lines are still visible once the board becomes cluttered."
magicTCG,3e1kh2,combolinguo,9,Tue Jul 21 06:33:28 2015 UTC,"You need to ask a lawyer. MTGO is already banned in several states due to gambling laws. I promise you Hasbro/WotC is getting legal advice here.   The sweaters analogy is ridiculous - sweaters have inherent value and they depreciate. Having an arbitrary currency that can effectively be turned into cash for a small transaction fee is clearly a problem (""we're not gambling. we're using chips!"").   Awarding boosters is, I'm sure, already in a legal gray area."
magicTCG,3e1kh2,cferejohn,3,Tue Jul 21 06:45:37 2015 UTC,"Rather than asking why the gambling laws are a problem, you should be asking ""how could they be written to not be a problem?"". Because when you start thinking about it, it's really hard for gambling laws to not apply to a game like MTG as well unless you're very careful with how things are set up.  Poker and MTG:   Both involve, similarly proportioned, cards arranged in a deck Involve a significant luck factor Require an entry fee to play in tournaments, a portion of which is paid out in some way at the end    Moreover, can you really argue that MTG isn't actually gambling to some degree? When you play in an MTG tournament there is a significant luck factor in your deck choice and within the matchups themselves. Should gambling laws not apply to it as well, and why not? If you argue no on skill involvement, that's a pretty blurry line, Poker involves quite a lot of skill as well.   WotC does their best to try to keep the law from asking those questions. Even if they could get away with more than what they are right now, pushing it is dangerous, because they don't want to end up being hit by legislation that makes gambling laws end up applying to them."
magicTCG,3e1kh2,stravant,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:05:59 2015 UTC,"The crucial point, at least in most EU countries, is the existence of the pot in poker, and not in magic. In germany it's different, they just look at the kind of prizes which are awarded, for example.  I don't see magic as gambling as there is no actual betting being done. The whole mechanics of raising, folding, calling and whatever (NOTE: I don't play poker, and I don't know how to, this is just passing knowledge so don't crucify me if I said something wrong) are what defines poker and similar games as gambling.  I don't know how it is in the US. If I get the chance to talk to a lawyer friend of mine that resides there I'll ask him, but here in the EU, those questions are asked and answered."
magicTCG,3e1kh2,Timiniel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:05:53 2015 UTC,"Prefix: I am not a lawyer.  Nothing here is legal advice, and I am just reading statues on their face.    Let's look at a pretty restrictive state for gambling laws, Missouri: http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/Missouri/ pulls out the sections in question from Missouri state law.  You can see the laws directly at http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/ChaptersIndex/chaptIndex572.html including the update due to go into effect in 2017.  It does not impact any of the sections I'll be talking about.  I'll bold some things for emphasis.     (3) ""Contest of chance"", any contest, game, gaming scheme or gaming device in which the outcome depends in a material degree upon an element of chance, notwithstanding that the skill of the contestants may also be a factor therein;     Basically, if you play a game with a luck element that has a big impact on the outcome, even if there is skill involved, it is a ""contest of chance"".  Sounds like Magic to me.   (4) ""Gambling"", a person engages in gambling when he or she stakes or risks something of value upon the outcome of a contest of chance or a future contingent event not under his or her control or influence, upon an agreement or understanding that he or she will receive something of value in the event of a certain outcome. Gambling does not include bona fide business transactions valid under the law of contracts, including but not limited to contracts for the purchase or sale at a future date of securities or commodities, and agreements to compensate for loss caused by the happening of chance, including but not limited to contracts of indemnity or guaranty and life, health or accident insurance; nor does gambling include playing an amusement device that confers only an immediate right of replay not exchangeable for something of value. Gambling does not include any licensed activity, or persons participating in such games which are covered by sections 313.800 to 313.840;   That's the definition.  Everything after ""Gambling does not include"" is basically saying insurance and stock purchases are not gambling.  You can also ignore the references to 313.  Those basically say ""if you do it on a riverboat it's fine.""  Gambling as defined here is illegal in Missouri.  Could someone construe MTGO as being gambling there?  Probably!  You do ""stake"" something (your tournament entry fee) and get back ""something of value"", and Magic really exactly fits the ""contest of chance"" it talks about.  This is all by design.  Missouri wants people to not be able to run poker tournaments outside of riverboats.  Writing a law that allows Magic tournaments but not poker tournaments is not even close to being on their radar, and is also very hard.  Many states use a definition that talks about the transfer of something from one person to another, with the house acting as an intermediary.  So if I put in cash in and get cash out, that's bad in those states.  But if I put cash in and get boosters out, that's OK in those states.  This is where the ""can't pay out in tix if it takes tix"" thing comes from.  Because state law determines what is and is not gambling and is and is not illegal for Wizards to offer, they tend to err on the side of caution rather than trying to frantically keep up with 50 states and as many countries all having massively different laws."
magicTCG,3e1kh2,robbit_mn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:03:52 2015 UTC,"Probably! You do ""stake"" something (your tournament entry fee) and get back ""something of value""   This is not what a bet or stake is. You are not betting or staking anything. An entry fee is not a stake. The poker concept of ""the pot"" is what a stake is."

magicTCG,3dw77z,EternalPhi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:06:17 2015 UTC,"You're right, it's 20 min away with no transportation (love Iowa) and all they play at that store is casual, so it's not that enjoyable."
magicTCG,3dw77z,JuventusX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:24:46 2015 UTC,You have my condolences.  Seems like the owner is a bit of a wad.  Is the owner friendly at least? Welcoming?  I want to hope that they can at least see things from the players' perspective.
magicTCG,3dw77z,EternalPhi,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:33:18 2015 UTC,"Yes actually, he is friendly and gives good deals on packs, along with no tax which is nice."

magicTCG,3dw77z,gronten,3,Mon Jul 20 18:42:27 2015 UTC,Well the OP of the other thread complaining about their store claims that there's one 20 minutes away from this one.
magicTCG,3dw77z,Phr33k101,12,Mon Jul 20 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is true. However, that store only plays casual fnm. Basically, you can play anything. They also only carry the bare minimum of magic products. No event decks, clash packs, sealed events, or sleeves. Lastly, we are high school students and a 30-35 minute drive is not very practical."
magicTCG,3dw77z,RoboticElfJedi,4,Mon Jul 20 05:23:04 2015 UTC,Anything goes fnm? Heh that must not be fun

If they get disqualified, there will still be a way to have FNMs (maybe Wizards will waive some of the hoops to qualify if you let them know this is the only local store)."
magicTCG,3dw77z,QuackerMTG,5,Mon Jul 20 02:04:41 2015 UTC,"You need to have a dci account that is registered to a store that has meet all of the qualifications in order to host an fnm and set up the event in the prior month.

magicTCG,3dw77z,berryblackwater,61,Mon Jul 20 01:25:09 2015 UTC,"Hmm..... The store owner also received 40 prerelease packs for the prerelease, however, he opened 20 of them before the tournament date. On the day of the prerelease many more than 20 people came into the store but he turned them down saying he only had 20 packs to sell for the prerelease.  Is this something that is ok for a store to do?"
magicTCG,3dw77z,liucoke,89,Mon Jul 20 01:30:09 2015 UTC,"No it's not OK, that much is fairly obvious. Report it to wizards."
magicTCG,3dw77z,notaballoon,3,Mon Jul 20 01:33:58 2015 UTC,Why would he even do this? The potential value in those packs is not where near the value of the players paying $25 for them.

I have heard rumors about an LGS in my area(not mine) who opened packs and re-stickered them down after checking for a promo walker. Shady shit happens among nerds."
magicTCG,3dw77z,thecheat420,-91,Mon Jul 20 19:54:53 2015 UTC,"It's the store's product, and their choice what to do with it. Their allocation for next prerelease will probably be affected if they only held a 20-player event, however."
magicTCG,3dw77z,liucoke,42,Mon Jul 20 02:13:02 2015 UTC,I would bet anything that he reported a 40 player event.

magicTCG,3dw77z,bmemike,-3,Mon Jul 20 12:23:34 2015 UTC,"It's not gray at all. The store purchases the product from Wizards, and it becomes their stuff.  They agree to certain restrictions on when they're allowed to sell it and under what circumstances (as in, you can seem them to players registered in a prerelease event, but you can't just put them on the shelves for retail until releases date), but they don't require that you sell every prerelease kit or that you hold a certain number of events or that those events have a certain number of seats.  Stores are free to just crack them if they want, but allocation is based on the number of participants in previous prereleases, plus stores aren't getting kits much cheaper than other sealed product, plus holding events brings in ancillary revenue, so most don't because it would make them less money.  Source: I manage prereleases and other events for my LGS."
magicTCG,3dw77z,notaballoon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"Why is this getting massively downvoted if it's true? It's a really shitty thing to do, but it'll only hurt them when they don't make a profit off of those boxes from prerelease and then they get less people because they're sold out at 20 (and apparently are the only higher-end store for a decent distance)."
magicTCG,3dw77z,Little_Gray,13,Mon Jul 20 15:12:38 2015 UTC,"Also, don't you have to have 8 players to call it FNM and give promos (making that draft an even worse violation)?"
magicTCG,3dw77z,Badfiend,25,Mon Jul 20 02:00:47 2015 UTC,"You need 8 players to sanction the event. If you don't get the necessary 8, then you're supposed to cancel the event in WER and just create a casual event.   There's nothing that restricts you from giving out the promos during that event if it's being held in place of the FNM event that you're canceling, however."
magicTCG,3dw77z,blakerboy777,5,Mon Jul 20 02:50:42 2015 UTC,"A lot of stores, especially smaller ones, pad their events, which is what he likely did. It's not always a strictly scumbaggy thing like this: sometimes stores can't get together a full pod, and the promos would otherwise just sit in the store owner's pocket until they can be sold."
magicTCG,3dw77z,Badfiend,9,Mon Jul 20 02:43:41 2015 UTC,While some stores may due that both padding the events or selling the promos will cause you to lose your official status with wizards.  It amounts to falsifying tournament results and Wizards comes down very harshly on people who do that.  Stores are also not allowed to sell the promos wizards gives them at any point in time and they have to be given out at events.    They can buy promos off of players and sell those ones but that is it.
magicTCG,3dw77z,Little_Gray,4,Mon Jul 20 03:23:52 2015 UTC,"On the other hand, if events were never padded it would mean many players simply don't get an opportunity to win a promo. If every draft in a month at your LGS (or even just the one you managed to make it to that month) gets cancelled because not enough players show up, who is to blame for the fact that you were never even given a chance to win that month's promo? I don't think punishing stores with fewer players (or more precisely, punishing those few players themselves) is really in Magic's best interest. I suppose what I'm saying is if your Friday draft is short a couple players, I don't think it makes sense to punish the players for low attendance or the store owner for padding the event so he can actually give out the promos he's not allowed to sell."
magicTCG,3dw77z,Badfiend,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:39:00 2015 UTC,They can still give out the promos. They just can't sell them or lie about the tournament results. They have have a casual event if FNM get's cancelled and give out promos.
magicTCG,3dw77z,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"I thought it had to be a sanctioned event, and thus an 8 man pod."
magicTCG,3dw77z,jsweet4979,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:38:54 2015 UTC,If your store is having attendance issues that is an issue that should be dealt with properly.  If you are willing to pad numbers for one event whats to stop them from doing it at a gpt or pptq or whatever.   You also have to remember that their allocation of many products is based on tournament results.

magicTCG,3dw77z,flapjack,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:49 2015 UTC,"In practice, I imagine that a store that treated their players well, and padded events for the benefit of the players (rather than to hook their friends up with sweet promos) would probably not have to worry about being reported to Wizards for a technical violation like that.  Who's going to report them?"
magicTCG,3dw77z,foxesforsale,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:53:04 2015 UTC,"All it takes is one player that hasn't played at that store in a while, to look at their match history and see an event listed that they didn't play in. That player contacts wizards, wizards investigates and the store probably loses their sanctioning. The risks just aren't worth it."
magicTCG,3dw77z,nick012000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:28 2015 UTC,They actually can never sell promo's unless they are bought from players.  Extra promo's can be given out at other events.  I've had one LGS that kept them and used them as door prizes.  Another gives out extra promo's at events every so often (for example I got extra promo's for T4 at a sealed event)
magicTCG,3dw77z,Ghepip,12,Mon Jul 20 23:04:32 2015 UTC,I don't think they can sanction an event with only 6 players.
magicTCG,3dw77z,sylverfyre,5,Mon Jul 20 02:50:31 2015 UTC,Sanctioned drafts are always 8 man. You need at least 8 players for any other type of tournament.
magicTCG,3dw77z,I_always_drop_ammo,2,Mon Jul 20 03:08:31 2015 UTC,"I thought it was a minimum of 7? It's just that if you do, someone's going to be getting a bye in each round."

magicTCG,3dw77z,JuventusX,5,Mon Jul 20 09:06:36 2015 UTC,Would make the drive to another store. Closest store is not always the best store. That's the case for me.
magicTCG,3dw77z,Coker42,5,Mon Jul 20 05:11:31 2015 UTC,"Yup, been at a store like this before where there was FNM as far as reporting wins and everything . . . but ""no prize support"". Found out way later he was just opening the packs and stocking the singles in the case or eBaying off really valuable cards. And promos.  Luckily, that place got shut down when it was basically gutted by someone who found out he didn't lock the back door religiously and all you needed was an aluminium ruler."
magicTCG,3dw77z,fiduke,4,Mon Jul 20 08:23:02 2015 UTC,"Can we create a subreddit for shitty LGS drama? Yes shops are allowed to hand out promos as they see fit, ask ahead of time if you aren't sure, if the only reason you're there is for a path to exile then you should be doing this anyway."
magicTCG,3dw77z,nick012000,2,Mon Jul 20 15:31:31 2015 UTC,"No, but obviously I was mad when I placed op 4 and was alerted I wouldn't be getting a very good card I wanted."
magicTCG,3dw77z,wonkifier,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:00 2015 UTC,"Quick side question,  semi related.  If there are 2 simultaneous events both scheduled, say modern and standard. Both for FNM. IF one only gets 4 players, one gets 20, is it alright to give any promos to the 4 player event? Saw some things no similar to this once and this jogged my memory"
magicTCG,3dw77z,drewdadruid,2,Mon Jul 20 09:06:23 2015 UTC,Promos are generally able to be given out up to the store's discretion. They will have extras to give out as they see fit. This is most likely the extra promos.
magicTCG,3dw77z,wonkifier,-2,Mon Jul 20 11:46:11 2015 UTC,"You need a minimum of 7 players for an event to fire, IIRC."
magicTCG,3dw77z,bmemike,4,Mon Jul 20 10:14:30 2015 UTC,It's actually 8.  Though they can hold an FNM casual event with a minimum of 4 I believe.
magicTCG,3dw77z,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:48:10 2015 UTC,I thought casual events weren't sanctioned and thus didn't receive prize support from wizards (promos)
magicTCG,3dw77z,bmemike,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:23:57 2015 UTC,"There were some change to that with the new ""any format for FNM"" thing they started this year.  I'm fuzzy on it though, and can't find a good document to describe it in detail."
magicTCG,3dw77z,Desdomen,-2,Mon Jul 20 13:43:24 2015 UTC,"Shops can now run as many ""FNMs"" as they want and they can distribute the promos however they see fit. I believe this means they don't need to give promos out for each of the events as long as all the promos for the week are given out at one of the FNMs.  It's shitty that they didn't inform the players until midway through the second event, but I doni't think this explicitly violates any rules. They're just doing their job as a TO poorly.  I would talk to the owner and ask for more transparency and better communication. You can also ask for them to distribute promos across each of the events.   Honestly, talking to the shop is 1,000x better than posting here because we can't change anything.   These changes were announced last October: http://magic.wizards.com/en/events/coverage/ptktk/friday-night-magic-changes-2014-10-14"
magicTCG,3dw77z,bmemike,5,Mon Jul 20 02:47:41 2015 UTC,Except that it needs to be a sanctioned event.  It was stated they only had six people for the draft which means it was a casual event and not a FNM event.
magicTCG,3dw77z,Little_Gray,5,Mon Jul 20 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"If you fail to hit 8 players, you simply cancel the prescheduled event in WER and create a casual event. You can (and should) still hand out the promos to that casual event that you're running in place of the FNM.   Hitting 8 isn't a requirement for handing out promos. It's only a requirement for actually sanctioning the event."
magicTCG,3dw77z,bmemike,5,Mon Jul 20 03:38:08 2015 UTC,It falls under the idea that there was a sanctioned event (Modern) and an unsanctioned event (6-man Draft) and the promos were given out to the unsanctioned players with no notice or prior information to the sanctioned players.
magicTCG,3dw77z,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:07:20 2015 UTC,"Right - I think they're not doing their jobs well and need to communicate better (see above), but I believe they're able to have that distribution according to the WPN."
magicTCG,3dw77z,LippyJ,0,Mon Jul 20 04:42:43 2015 UTC,Thats only really true if its the only event you are running that night.  If you are also running another sanctioned event with enough players you should be giving promos out to that one.
magicTCG,3dw77z,lupiinoctourne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"That's an opinion though. I share it with you, but it's not an obligation. Stores are allowed to distribute promos how they want now."
magicTCG,3dw77z,bmemike,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:43:20 2015 UTC,Not entirely.  They change on how they were given out was just that you dont have to give them to first and second anymore.  You still have to give them out (a minimum of four) at sanctioned FNM tournaments.  You are only allowed to give them out elsewhere if you have extras.
magicTCG,3dw77z,lupiinoctourne,2,Mon Jul 20 04:59:06 2015 UTC,"""Stores will now have the opportunity to set their own methods of distributing promo cards to players at their events.""  Can you link your source for the minimum-four comment? I haven't found that anywhere, and is useful to know for future reference."
magicTCG,3dw77z,bmemike,-1,Mon Jul 20 06:30:01 2015 UTC,"But if promos are for sanctioned fnm events, then that draft shoundt of gotten any at all. Let alone all 6 players getting promos."
magicTCG,3dw77z,lupiinoctourne,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:47:11 2015 UTC,"So if you're a shop that runs a single FNM event each week and you have 6 people show up, you think that the shop should tell those players ""Sorry, since more people didn't show up, the few of you that did get punished and I'm not giving you promos tonight""?  That makes NO sense and not backed up by the WPN policy.  The core issue is how poorly the shop communicated their promo distribution, not that they were given out in an event that had fewer than 8 players."
magicTCG,3dw77z,jsweet4979,-1,Mon Jul 20 15:08:38 2015 UTC,"The issue is that there were two side-by-sude events; one that was 'sanctioned' a modern event with plenty of people, and a draft that fired off as a casual event with 6 people. Thats the issue described.  The issue was that all 6 people in the casual draft got promos, and no one in the sanctioned full modern event got one (not even the winners). To make matters worse, one of the 6 was the lgs owner, meaning that he gave himself a promo.  Yes distribution is completely up to the LgS and is backed by policy, in this case herin lies issue. I did not say that if an fnm with less than 8 fired that promos should be witheld. Im juxtapositioning the two events; the draft with 6 people including the owner that got 6 promos, and the modern event with 15+ people that got none."
magicTCG,3dw77z,lupiinoctourne,2,Mon Jul 20 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"You seem to be getting WAY hung up on the whole sanctioned vs casual thing. I'm forced to believe this because you continue to point out the event sizes. Ultimately, it's irrelevant. The difference doesn't actually matter IRT how you can choose to distribute promos.   Second, you get 5 promos to distribute at core level. So that means that someone in the 6-man didn't get one. I'm going to assume it was the owner that didn't get one if the OP said ""everyone"" (of the players) got one.   Juxtapositioning the two events isn't productive though because (as you've acknowledge) you're allowed to distribute promos however you want.   If all you're saying in the last paragraph is instead ""I disagree with this decision"", then we're actually on the same page. I think it's shitty. I've said that a number of times. But doing dumb things isn't the same as doing the wrong thing against policy. That's what a lot of people are saying (see all the cries to report them above)."
magicTCG,3dw77z,jsweet4979,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:42:21 2015 UTC,Wait so they explicitly gave promos to all 6 in the draft? Uhm....okay whos heard of going into an event ane everyone getting a promo? Cause usualy its the top 3 plus a random 4th.
magicTCG,3dw77z,berryblackwater,3,Mon Jul 20 09:45:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, it's totally at the store's discretion.  I've never heard of it, but there's nothing to stop them from doing that.  In a different context, it would actually probably be a nice thing to do.    Like, take this hypotehtical: Let's say it's an LGS like my preferred shop, where a typical FNM is 20-40 people.  And let's say there is a terrible snowstorm and only 8 people show up.  It would be kinda cool if the owners gave out a promo to everybody, to thank them for making the difficult drive.  I don't see anything wrong with that.  Obviously, that's not what's going on here :)"
magicTCG,3dw77z,sirBHM27,0,Mon Jul 20 13:55:06 2015 UTC,"As much as it is their discretion however....that does open the store to critique as to their judgement. Especially the fact in this case one event that doesn't meet criteria, yet the one that does doesn't get promos.  Now, if the LGS regularly gives out 8 promos in the 20-40 fnm, and they've figured out the distribution, and then they get 8 people, then why not? And i mean yeah, the snowstorm example's valid.  I suppose the above situation is an example of WotC's blanket policy rearing its head of consequence."
magicTCG,3dw77z,MetalicRaptor,2,Mon Jul 20 14:28:40 2015 UTC,"In the end, I think this store is doing SO much sketchy stuff, it's just impossible to contextualize all of it :)  BTW, for point of reference, the LGS I was talking about does 4 round booster drafts for FNM, and everybody who goes 3-1 gets one promo card, and everybody who goes 4-0 gets two copies of the promo.  That's a lot more than ""top 3 plus random 4th"", and it's totally legit.   That said, yeah, I think at pretty much any LGS, you're typically not going to get a promo with a losing record, barring exceptional circumstances (or shady ass shit like this place)."

magicTCG,3dymm5,epicmtgplayer,2,Mon Jul 20 16:34:05 2015 UTC,"I can see the number changing drastically depending on what you're running.  I run 0 in my stax deck, 1 in my combo oona deck that I tutor for when needed and pretty much every black boardwipe in my mikaeus deck."
magicTCG,3dymm5,Nads89,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:17 2015 UTC,"Totally depends on what kind of deck you're playing, what your friends are playing, and what colours you're playing.  I don't think there's a right or wrong number.  If your friends are playing big fatties, damage based wraths aren't as effective.  If everyone is playing durdle control decks, 0 may be the right number.  For example, my Oloro deck runs 6 board wipe effects due to the fact that it's very creature light.  My Oona Deck has a ton of cheap fearies so Wrathing is generally not my end game.  Instead I've got some more situational cards like Innocent Blood, Barter in Blood and Capsize. Cyclonic Rift is a ""Board Wipe"" that is extremellllllllllly effective at shutting down opponents strategies.  Merciless Eviction's exile clause is often very relevant, as is Anger of the Gods.  Sometimes Black Sun's Zenith is the best card in my deck.  Wrath of God just gets there sometimes too, although Supreme Verdict is better if you're running creatures that can regenerate themselves."

What kind of removal changes with the type of deck I'm playing, Control obviously gets more Wraths than Aggro, but generally I run at least four or five straight up Wraths. Blue and Green are more complicated than the other colors because Blue mostly bounces (Cyclonic Rift, Evacuation, etc.) and green hits everything but creatures (Corrosion, Back to Nature, nonbasics) but that's rarely a problem with multicolor decks."
magicTCG,3dymm5,Parryandrepost,2,Mon Jul 20 18:25:26 2015 UTC,If you want one consistently mid game then you want around 7.   If you want one late game or not every game then 2-7.   If you want one very early and often the 12+ is the number.   These numbers include tutors.
magicTCG,3dymm5,bladezaim,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:35 2015 UTC,what if your card draw engine is bonkers/ you usually see most of your deck
magicTCG,3dymm5,MTGCardFetcher,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:58 2015 UTC,"still 7. You plan the deck with the 7 rule before making changes. This typically means any 1 card type that is important that you want to see mid game needs to be 7x regardless of others because you want that card independent of being ahead or behind.   Now, this is just all theory. 7 isn't a hard number and cuts and alterations are expected once testing/play happens, but for initial construction the 7 rule is super nice to get a feel for the deck.    example:  My tasigur edh deck has 7x card advantage spells because I want a shit ton of card advantage. It had originally 7 ramp spells, 7 reanimator spells, and 7 ""fatties"", but those numbers changed to 8/7/6 as I found I needed more fast mana and less top end after testing the deck."

He isn't anywhere near as self absorbed but he's probably the person that fits that bill the most.

You may also know him from the hearthstone scene as he streams rather frequently (twitch.tv/bmkibler).  Luis Scott-Vargas (LSV): Cannot turn down value which in turn leads to a general skew to blue strategies that draw inordinate amounts of cards. Great personality, Hall of Famer, streams infrequently (twitch.tv/lsv), co-host of Limited Resources podcast. Tom ""The Boss"" Ross: Leather Jacket afficionado, tight agressive playstyle that led to multiple legacy tournament wins with infect and standard tournament wins with mono-red and heroic strategies in the past couple of years. Likely the reason that a major team on the pro tour decided to play infect when modern rolled around.  Guillaume Wafo-Tapa: Hall of Famer, generally known for playing foiled out control decks in every format if given the chance. If you want to play control he puts on a clinic in his matches. Adrian Sullivan: Another control player with a much more lively personality, well known (and at times disliked) for playing his board state upside-down facing his opponents. Sam Black + Patrick Chapin: The ""deck builders."" Chapin is a Hall of Famer but these two have been responsible for a number of winning pro tour deck lists as well as being generally skilled players in their own rights.

He meets up with the other Japanese players to practice drafting, and they always say that Shouta shows up with a unique deck and kicks all of their asses.  Plus, he plays lightning fast.

I didn't set the product aside for myself before customers ever had a chance at it."
magicTCG,3dyj5p,SquirrelDragon,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:06:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, in the hypothetical situation a customer with a coupon that gives an employee level discount on an unlimited amount of product zeroing an inventory... would still be different because a customer's patronage is different from an employee's perk.  If (to use a non-hypothetical) I have a coupon that I stupidly did not put a limit on for tow hitches, and someone buys 6 tow hitches then great, happy customer, probably should not write up coupons while hungover.   If an employee knows those tow hitches are hot products and can be resold for twice the amount and buys them out using an employee discount which I didn't restrict because I respect my employees and hope they'll do the same to myself and my business? Guess what, shitty employee.  I gave you benefit of the doubt in your other post but now you're making me think I was mistaken with this.  In the end of the day shorting your boss a few hundred by abusing your employee discount isn't the end of the world. Sucks for any customers who couldn't buy the product, sucks even more that they then went elsewhere."
magicTCG,3dyj5p,PJNifty,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:30 2015 UTC,"In your mind, would the situation be different if the product in question wasn't a hot commodity? If I had bought out the remaining stock of Dragons packs, would you still be trying to paint me as a scumbag taking advantage of my employer?   I'm not a business owner, and it sounds like you are, or you at least run one, so I can understand where you're coming from: You've got this great product, and you expect to make X% profit from that product's sales, and here comes your employee who you provide Y% discount, and that employee buys out your product, leaving you Y% shy of your projections.   We're talking about half a box here, not even a full box, let alone a case. To use your tow hitch example, if the employee is reselling them at a profit, using his discount, that is indeed abusive and the employer would be foolish to allow that to happen. However, where's the harm if the employee is actually buying and using 8 tow hitches for himself? I bought the packs for myself, for my collection, for my use.  I'd rather give my work the business, with my discount, then bring my business elsewhere at full price out of some hoity-toity principle. And if you're saying I should have deferred my discount and paid full price when I have the discount as a viable option, you're the one who's being foolish."
magicTCG,3dyj5p,SquirrelDragon,0,Mon Jul 20 21:00:10 2015 UTC,"Or perhaps the nebulous concept of ""caring"" should play NO PART in this at all.  It is your job as the employer to set the rules for your employees and if you did not inform them at the time of hiring the terms of their discount then you deserve every bit of ""loss"" that it causes.   If their emp discount states that it works on any item in the store and they use it in that fashion without breaking any rules then you have no right to retroactively ask for them to return shit. And you're a terrible boss if you do. ESPECIALLY if you terminate an employee for saying no.   Just like the businesses they work for employees are out for themselves and as long as what they are doing is allowed within the rules then they have every right to take advantage of their discount."
magicTCG,3dyj5p,RidiculousIncarnate,0,Mon Jul 20 19:15:34 2015 UTC,"Yup, which leads to more and more restrictive clauses making the discount more and more useless.  If an employee in my shop wants 8 of a part because he's working on a project, then I will work out something. Or I could have a hard ""limit X per whatever"" and then have to give exceptions so often as to be worthless.  Your post is the sort of thing that is wrong with employee/employer relations in the states. Too much ""fuck you, you didn't explicitly say don't do this, got mine."" To repeat an oft stated fact, just because I don't have a rule saying ""don't shit on my desk"" doesn't mean I can't get annoyed when you shit on my desk.  If I bring an employee in and ask them to work with me to rectify a situation which is askew and they stonewall me, it had better be for a damned good reason. Zeroing inventory on a hot product for personal benefit isn't a good enough reason."
magicTCG,3dyj5p,PJNifty,-4,Mon Jul 20 19:23:50 2015 UTC,"I disagree with you there. I see nothing wrong with using my discount that way, as I'm following the store's policy."

If you did it without talking to your boss first then you were well aware that what you were doing was questIonable. Of course, if you did then all clear.  The issue isn't with you using your employee discount, it is with clearing out a saleable good, one which may not be restockable. Buying a box out of a case? Greenlight, full systems go. Buying the case?  As for you'd be fine with buying a box of unhinged that slipped through inventory at MSRP because the owner hadn't updated the cost of an item he believed was at 0 inventory... yeah, that's skuzzy."
magicTCG,3dyj5p,PJNifty,0,Mon Jul 20 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"Considering my boss was the one who rang me out, I don't see a problem with it, and clearly he didn't either. I didn't scoop up the product before it hit shelves, I worked the evening shift and bought what hadn't already sold that day. Hell, He was going to buy them if I hadn't.   I never said anything about being ok with undercosting unhinged boxes. When I said I got the MM packs for less than MSRP, I'm saying they were priced as normal, and after the discount was applied the price per pack came out to just under MSRP.

magicTCG,3dxdgp,Dmbb1239,16,Mon Jul 20 09:08:30 2015 UTC,Pili-Pala and Grand Architect  Technically it is a 2 card combo but you also need something to do with the infinite mana it produces and kolaghans command becoming more popular means that being an artifact is a very dangerous proposition.  Unfortunately it isnt a pure two card combo like twin and doesnt really have any redundant pieces like Anafenza company combo.  Some sort of Ug combo build is probably the best way to capitalise on it but anything that uses infintie mana is generally a dead card outside of the combo.  This hasnt stopped me trying to bew a temur chord of calling based deck that uses the mana for train of thought and pyrmatics.

magicTCG,3dxdgp,CalT2410,6,Mon Jul 20 18:44:04 2015 UTC,"But the thing that makes Fold better than some of the other combos in this thread is that Fold by itself does something outside of the combo. Yes, it's a really shitty counterspell but it has its uses. For example if your opponent goes for the Splinter Twin and you fold it they get something like a Pestermite out of it which isn't really that big of a deal.  And as for the enabler you really want to be using it off something like Probe so that if fold doesn't go off you still get some value off the resolved Probe."

And because it mind rots them every turn, that ain't gonna be for long.  The biggest problem is that Spirit is hella fragile, and Coliseum+Loam puts us in three colors with a nonbasic that only makes one of them. Also the combo gets broken up by Deathrite Shaman, which is legal in all formats Coliseum is legal in. So fuck that guy for ruining my ""fun.""  Could go four-color, adding red, to put in some Punishing Fire to deal with DRS, but then I dunno.  The other option with Crucible probably means we'd want to splash black for Chains of Mephistopheles as a more-resilient Spirit, but it does give the opponent a draw step, meaning that you have to activate the Coliseum after they draw, giving them a chance to cast instants like Abrupt Decay or Wear//Tear. Might be OK game 1 against non-GB decks, though.  Also it loses hilariously to dredge.   The Bant version at least gives you the chance to play Knight of the Reliquary (it finds Coliseum and plays well with Loam) which can also get Bojuka Bog in games 2 and 3, so you're not totally dead.  Otherwise, the other problem is that Miracles can still flip their SDT on your turn for Terminus, and there's really nothing you can do about it."

A while back, they kinda gave up on Modern... but the community rose up, voiced their concern, and got Modern back on the Pro Tour.  Being that they have a new card frame that followed their retracted announcement of killing Modern, I think they might have been planning a new format of cards that have only been printed with the new border (obviously, old border cards with the same name as a card printed in new border would be legal, like ONS fetches).  So maybe they're planning on dropping this announcement at some point in the future.  It wouldn't really make sense to announce the format during a time when the format would be smaller than the current standard."

magicTCG,3dvcgh,Aethien,11,Sun Jul 19 21:07:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah basically ETB abilities had split second under 5E rules. Your opponent's abilities weren't fast enough to cast between them knowing what the target would be, and the target being hit."

Think of how in Magic today, there's no time to play a spell between the two parts of a Cryptic Command happening. Nekrataal entering 'play' (the terminology of the day) and the creature being chosen and dying worked like that.  You would have been able to respond to a [[Flametounge Kavu]]'s ETB ability back then (had the card existed) but only with a card that explicitly prevented damage, not one that modified the target, due to damage prevention effects being faster than instant at the time. But for a nondamaging effect this wasn't the case.  Edit: Actually a much more accurate example. You know how in today's rules, once your opponent names a card for [[Cabal Therapy]] or tells you which card they are taking with [[Thoughtseize]] it's too late to use that card in response?

Which creatures would you pick for that slot in the early expansions, if you were to revisit the subject? Mine would be:  Limited Edition: It's hard to pick the most ""influential"" card from the first set, but there are definitely creatures who set a massive precedent one way or another just by existing in it. Cards like [[Hill Giant]], [[Gray Ogre]], and [[Grizzly Bears]] laid the groundwork for how much mana it took to get what stats, and which colours could most efficiently cast creatures.  Arabian Nights: [[El-Hajjaj]] helped inspire the lifelink ability.  Antiquities: Probably [[Atog]]. Created an entire creature type as well as the type's signature mechanic. [[Triskelion]] is another standout, one of the first creatures to really monkey around with +1/+1 counters in an interesting way the way ""clockwork"" artifact creatures or Simic-aligned cards did later.  Legends: Without a doubt, the original cycle of Elder Dragon Legends. This set introduced multicoloured and legendary creatures, but the height of the wow factor that a great legend can create was present in these monsters. It also had the first creature that could produce off-colour mana, [[Fire Sprites]].  The Dark: [[Grave Robbers]] and [[Frankenstein's Monster]] introduced the idea of purging one's own graveyard for effects, something we still see today with mechanics like Delve, and [[Tracker]] introduced the ""fight"" ability to green's slice of the pie. It also had a hand in pushing the biggest creatures in the game to be bigger, with [[Leviathan]].  Fallen Empires: While Goblins were among the first three tribal types in Limited Edition supported by a single rare lord (in this case, [[Goblin King]]), it wasn't until [[Goblin Chirurgeon]] that specifically sacrificing Goblins became such a big part of their mechanical identity."

magicTCG,3dvcgh,fremeer,3,Mon Jul 20 10:55:03 2015 UTC,"Naming one creature for the early sets is often hard. It's basically impossible to pinpoint one in Alpha as it basically set the whole foundation.  For Arabian Nights, I would say it's the concept of undercosted bodies with a small drawbacks. Alpha did have a few creatures with upkeeps as drawback (force of nature for instance), but arabian nights really went all out on these, mainly with the efreets and djinns.   For Antiquities, my choice was Triskelion and Tetravus as well, for being the first creatures to use +1/+1 as resources.  For legends, it's really the whole set. As weak as the creature was, it really drove home how cool multicolored creatures and legends were.   I do like your choice for the Dark as well.  For Fallen Empires, I'm not sure I agree. Goblin sacrifice had already started in the dark, with goblin digging team and orc general. My pick would be the thallids as a whole, for pushing just how far you could go with counters."

Then it slid down to almost bulk status when people realised the drawback was enormous. At the time there was no real way to cheat it.  It first saw tournament play in a [[Survival of the Fittest]] fueled combo deck named Full English Breakfast, that would have a [[Volrath's Shapeshifter]] avoid the ETB penalty by entering as something else then becoming the 12/12 trampler.  In different decks the card remained a serious finisher in Legacy (alongside either [[Stifle]] or [[Illusionary Mask]] to avoid the drawback) until Return to Ravnica.  RtR added [[Abrupt Decay]] to the format, which was popular and was a hard trump to Dreadnought. Whilst there are answers to Decay and one ([[Misdirection]]) is playable on its own merits, these answers aren't 4-ofs and aren't even guaranteed to work.

If you start chumping sengir vampire, you're probably in trouble anyway. Baron Sengir costs 3 more mana just to add 1 power and 1 toughness and make the counters of the ability that never triggers bigger? And it can regenerate vampires? Who wants to regenerate vampires?

magicTCG,3dv1t0,Kereminde,-63,Sun Jul 19 22:15:14 2015 UTC,Down vote me again.  Let's put it down this way for you guys.  People are not great people and if you think we live in a warm fuzzy world then you are wrong.  Let me Show you how it is.  Your magic collection and decks are worth cash.  A normal deck worth around 200-400 or higher depending on format.  Which is an easy 100 dollars payout selling to the right store no questions asked.  Now let's break it down of why I ask you left your bag attended.  Would you leave 500 dollars on a table in a public area unattended? In a place where you already know that magic cards are frequently stolen.  Come on man.  You deserve to lose your cards as a learning experience.  I know it sucks but protect your self.

My decks aren't worth anywhere in the three digits, and the one which comes close doesn't leave my house. (Probably because it's highly illegal in all formats.)   Now let's break it down of why I ask you left your bag attended.   I'm more surprised you went on at length about the cards and not the iPad which is a lot easier to pawn off.  Also, while you have a point buried in all this mess, let me be the one to break it down for you. Pay attention, this will be on the final exam.  Nobody deserves to have terrible things happen to them."
magicTCG,3dv1t0,r2d2ismybro,2,Sun Jul 19 21:13:42 2015 UTC,It would actually be harder to pawn off an Ipad because they have more security protections.  Cards however are all indistinguishable from each other and unless the thief is dumb enough to try and pawn it all off at once on craigslist or a lgs it would be near impossible to recover them.
magicTCG,3dv1t0,Ambadastor,2,Sun Jul 19 21:47:03 2015 UTC,"It's incredibly easy to just walk up to someone and go ""Hey, I have this iPad I don't need. $50 and it's yours."" And far as I've seen around here (locally), I give good odds of someone buying it that way.  I see less odds of them being able to just dump cards that way unless they know a store. And, point given, most LGSs will probably see someone they don't know in a hurry to give up a lot of cards at once and either not deal or check if there's been a collection reported stolen."

There are also security measures on ipads (disabled in this case) that makes it hard to get any real amount of money for it.    With the cards on the other hand as long as they are not morons acting like they are trying to sell stolen property its very hard to tell.  People sell collections all the time especially at large tournaments like GP's not to mention all the other ways of piecing one out like facebook, ebay, TCGplayer, etc.  That is why its so hard to recover stolen collections."

These tokens will always have a special place in my heart. I won a PTQ back in January and got to fly to Brussels to compete in Pro Tour Dragons of Tarkir. After weeks of testing, I finally decided to play mono red splashing for atarka's command.   A few days before flying to brussels, I was playtesting and drinking wine at my house with some friends and my girlfriend. She noticed the tokens and suggested we spice them up a bit by giving each of them their own unique hat. She is a much better painter than I am and managed to knock out 6 of them before I had even finished my first!  While I didn't do so well at the event, The reactions from my opponents when they saw the goblins made the less than stellar performance much more enjoyable.  Hope you guys enjoy them as much as I do."

magicTCG,3dzuif,Taylor_Swiftspear,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:52:18 2015 UTC,"Looking at the cards, I don't think either will be a major top meta deck, but I can see Goblins doing occasionally pretty well.

magicTCG,3dzuif,Sanagoo333,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:40:28 2015 UTC,Goblins looks a little better but really is still just a worse version of mono red/Atarka red.  Tribal is rarely better in standard then just playing the best cards.  Neither deck can get by with out having to make some subpar card choices just to have a chance at an explosive game.  Tribal decks are usually best case scenario decks and the best case scenario is usually to easy to interrupt or just folds to removal.

magicTCG,3dyybx,MrAKitoto,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"Duel Decks aren't built with any particular format in mind but both Elspeth and Kiora are standard legal so you might be able to do something with those.   The Elspeth deck seems centered around tokens, if you wanted to get into Modern there is a black/white token Event Deck that you can pick up for $40-50. It could use some fine tuning but it should be enough for FNM. You might want to go with the black and white Sorins instead of Elspeth in that case because they're cheaper to play but the deck plays the same way, just faster and more efficiently."
magicTCG,3dyybx,GhostofEnlil,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:00:13 2015 UTC,"You should check out the FAQ in the sidebar.  Note that the EvK duel deck contains cards that aren't legal in Standard or Modern - those formats only care about cards printed in normal set releases (although any version of a legal card can be used).  The best way to build a deck in a constructed format is to look at decklists (I usually use mtgtop8), find one that looks interesting, and then proxy it up and test it.  If you don't like it, repeat the last step.  If you do, then buy/trade for the singles you need to build the deck."
magicTCG,3dyybx,alcaizin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:02:02 2015 UTC,"If you want to play competitively, check what formats your local game stores host, is it standard, modern, etc?  If its modern I would recommend easing into the format with decks like mono red or merfolk but substitute some of the expensive cards out with cheaper substitutes.  Also keep in mind you don't need crazy expensive cards to win FNMs, since each area is different (players, types of decks), you can possibly get away with weird deck brews.  Experiment with different types if you have time, scour the internet for recommendations/ideas you DON'T have to have the most expensive deck to have fun or place well in FNMs.    A recommendation if you want to buy something of value is the new Magic Origins Clash Pack, its about $25-33~. If your looking for booster packs, Dragons of Tarkir has a good pool of cards that are in multiple formats to some extent."

magicTCG,3dyxuv,mtgideas,3,Mon Jul 20 17:46:03 2015 UTC,It's interesting but I think that [[Thoughtseize]] should be run mainboard simply because casting [[The Great Aurora]] is the main win condition of the deck and nothing is going to hurt more than having a nine drop spell countered because you didn't check to see if your opponent had an answer in hand.  [[Zendikar's Roil]] also seems like it could be decent in this as well. Keeping up a tempo of 2/2s each turn until you play Aurora will definitely help against the aggro builds since you don't want to be blocking with mana dorks.

magicTCG,3dzolz,Breakreality,4,Mon Jul 20 20:54:47 2015 UTC,"Just because we're on Zendikar doesn't mean every mechanic is going to be land based. Maybe the set goes in another direction. I expect landfall to make a return, though."
magicTCG,3dzolz,Kurraga,3,Mon Jul 20 21:25:04 2015 UTC,"I think this leaves out the most exciting question: What will be replacing Annihilator as the Eldrazi mechanic? MaRo and others in R&D have said that Annihilator was too much of a ""feel-bad"" mechanic and caused a little too much on-board complexity for newer players with the timing of the trigger (ie ""no, you need to sac before you declare your blocks. No, it doesn't matter how you play with your friends at home."").   So, what do we get? It is a very tough needle to thread. The new versions of any of the Eldrazi Titans will need to live up to their predecessors while also following the new directions design has taken (MaRo has said that ROE was not very NWO compliant, even though NWO had been implemented already).   I think a lot of this set is going to hinge on getting that ability right. We need to fear these things again, like we feared their original incarnations."
magicTCG,3dzolz,EmersonEsq,2,Mon Jul 20 21:43:04 2015 UTC,"Without giving it any thought as to how balanced or feasible it would be, a mechanic that would deplete lands from their colors would still be pretty horrible, but would also be reasonably balanced and impressive (which Eldrazi should be)."

magicTCG,3dzolz,Tempest717,2,Mon Jul 20 20:57:02 2015 UTC,"It's too broad. There are many mechanics that could expressed as kicker (bestow, evoke, exploit, dash, just to name a few - they might work a little differently around the edges, but you could recreate all those mechanics using kicker)."
magicTCG,3dzolz,cferejohn,2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"Though kicker is usually an extra effect for additional mana, and most of these involve using less mana for something arguably less effective, but yeah, kicker could be applied in a way."
magicTCG,3dzolz,HUct,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:01 2015 UTC,"Those are more like alternate costs for a slightly different effect or something, kicker seemed to be exactly like you said, an extra benefit for a bit more mana."
magicTCG,3dzolz,Tempest717,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"The idea is that Mulldrifter could easily be remade as a {2}{U} 2/2 flier that draws two cards and sacs itself when it enters, with a kicker of {2} to keep it around.  Almost every Evoke creature is the same.  Kicker is an incredibly generic mechanic, and they'd prefer to have something more flavorful and slightly narrower."
magicTCG,3dzolz,alcaizin,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:53 2015 UTC,"Kicker is usually ""extra cost, extra effect.""  None of the mechanics you listed fit that model. Mechanics similar to kicker would be the Fuse cards from Dragon's Maze, or Overload from Return to Ravnica."
magicTCG,3dzolz,BrunoVonUno,0,Mon Jul 20 22:19:55 2015 UTC,"[b]Bestow[/b] Kicker: 1U - if the kicker cost is paid this card enters play as an enchantment attached to a creature you control. Creature you control gets blah blah blah.  [b]Evoke[/b] This creature is sacrificed after being played. Kicker: 3. If kicker is payed, do not sacrifice this creature after being played.  Exploit doesn't quite work, but dash certainly could.  In any case, that's the stated reason why Maro says that kicker was a mistake."

magicTCG,3dzolz,Tempest717,2,Mon Jul 20 21:35:34 2015 UTC,"There are a significant number of cards that cannot target lands, making them hard to remove and resistant to a lot of spells.

magicTCG,3dzolz,Yxoque,2,Mon Jul 20 21:38:34 2015 UTC,"Lands are hard to remove yes, but his ability turns them into creatures, which can easily be removed, losing you a land in the process too."

Already got these:  Main:  4 [[Favored Hoplite]]  4 [[Lagonna-Band Trailblazer]]  4 [[Seeker of the Way]]  4 [[Defiant Strike]]  4 [[Gods Willing]]  Sideboard:  4 [[Disdainful Stroke]]  1 [[Triton Tactics]]  1 [[Stratus Walk]]  4 [[Treasure Cruise]]  How good would 1 [[Narset Transcendent]], 2 [[Ojutai Exemplars]] and 1 [[Secure the Wastes]] go with the deck?"
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Sedsage,8,Mon Jul 20 03:44:03 2015 UTC,Not particularly well. It just kind of deviates from the strategy too much. Try Ordeals of Heliod and Thassa and maybe Center Soul instead!
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Greyshot26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:22:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right, I just really wanted to use the mythics I opened.  But I'm thinking it will be better to go with a Mono White deck, as I don't have the fetches or painlands to go with UW.  Here it is: http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/20-07-15-mono-white-heroic-budget/"
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Sedsage,3,Mon Jul 20 06:41:01 2015 UTC,Trade off the narset for flooded strands :)  Theyll hold value long-term better anyway!
magicTCG,3dvjy2,sylverfyre,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:15:30 2015 UTC,"But Narset is my first and only walker, too much sentimental value!"
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Sedsage,2,Mon Jul 20 19:48:36 2015 UTC,"This looks better, but really, this is the budget deck of the format.  As such, grabbing 4 temples and 2-3 gainlands isn't a bad idea and makes the deck much more smooth."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Greyshot26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:04:56 2015 UTC,I currently have 4 blue white fetches /3 blue white gains /  4 bluewhitered tapped lands.   I'm thinking about replacing some with mana confluence to make this deck a little faster. I'm thinking replace the blue white gain lands with 4 mana confluence to get rid of some tapped lands.   My question is if I add mana confluence what should I take out?
magicTCG,3dvjy2,BigKahunaBgr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:49 2015 UTC,"I like running: 3 islands, 6 plains, 3 temples, 4 fetches, 4 confluence. Maybe one more land, depending."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Greyshot26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:02:10 2015 UTC,"I already have the 4 gainlands, as they're really cheap. I don't wanna go for the scry lands because they'll rotate soon and won't hold the value a fetch would, so I'm thinking of going with the painlands, as they're cheaper and won't rotate for quite some time. I'm waiting for the prices to go lower with Origins, though."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Sedsage,2,Mon Jul 20 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"Well to be fair, the entire deck rotates soon. Scry lands are also fun for edh. There are also no relevant painlands. You would have to get a color you don't run."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Greyshot26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:42:03 2015 UTC,"Oh, the allied painlands aren't on Origins, oops!  But yeah, about the rotation, I'm trying to work with what I already have, that's why I'm avoiding to go for the exact same deck, I guess.  I'm coming back to the game since mid Fate Reforged, went to my first FNM this month and also to the Origins pre-release. That's why I don't have too many Theros / M15 cards."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Sedsage,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"That makes sense! Well, I think for the two months you have it, it's an extremely competitive deck if tunes properly and you can win events and use that prize support to get more Origins/Khans block stuff so that come rotation, you'll be well equipped to get a new deck built. I've played Heroic throughout Khans block to do that."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Greyshot26,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:28:03 2015 UTC,Sure thing! Thanks for the tips!
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Sedsage,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"Right before I stopped playing the deck after jamming it for the better part of all of Khans standard, Center Soul proved to be amazing. I found it significantly better than any other combat trick in the deck personally. I also played with Dig Through Time a bit and it proved to be an all star. It forced you to go a little heavier on a painful mana base (4 fetches, 3 Mana Confluence) but it was worth it some games where you tap out on their turn to win the next. Also don't ever underestimate the +2/+2 with rebound. I've stolen a few games with it for sure."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Albinoredguard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:45:36 2015 UTC,Mana confluence then use temur battle rage.   Wait till they say no blockers on you 4/4. Then hit them with 10 total after battle rage. That card has saved my heroic ass so many times.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,BigKahunaBgr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:57:12 2015 UTC,Yeah I really like it as well

magicTCG,3dvjy2,andy83991,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:34:09 2015 UTC,Because I don't have a job and according to google 1 Brazilian Real equals 0.31 US Dollar today... I also spent most of my mtg money with a monored deck.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Sedsage,0,Mon Jul 20 20:02:29 2015 UTC,With Mardu Dragons as prevalent as it is currently? I wouldn't even DARE touch Heroic.

I played this deck on Sunday and the Radiant Fountain was clutch.   edit: nm, this is the guy who build the thing. not worthy. this deck is way better than UB control.  Jeff, what do you think about adding a Hallowed Midnight or two to the board? I added two to the board because I knew a few friends would be playing the 5C rally deck, but in hindsight, I'm not sure if they were needed. I used them against a RDW utilizing tokens to great effect, but otherwise they didn't really come in handy."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,QuackerMTG,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:00:40 2015 UTC,I think if tokens gets popular moonlight could be fine.

magicTCG,3dvjy2,damnination333,17,Mon Jul 20 03:32:49 2015 UTC,didn't make day 2. Lost on the 9th round and couldn't go through.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,kaiseresc,23,Sun Jul 19 22:22:20 2015 UTC,"I feel like Newman made some major mistakes with the sideboard throughout the day. He had no answer to Dragonlord Dromoka (Reality Shift) and bringing in multiple creatures when he could easily win on a Pure fog plan seemed like a major mistake.  Then again, he supposedly got the sideboard together two hours before the event with zero testing, so it's somewhat forgivable."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Desdomen,13,Sun Jul 19 22:27:40 2015 UTC,I think that deck has hella potential.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Love_Bulletz,5,Sun Jul 19 23:14:43 2015 UTC,"It definitely does. It's well primed against midrange decks and performs well against Control.

magicTCG,3dvjy2,Shadowgurke,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:01:31 2015 UTC,I don't think day's undoing would help in that case as it'll just let your opponent draw more counters.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,st1r,3,Mon Jul 20 11:04:38 2015 UTC,the deck can only get better from now on. Like the Jeskai Ascendancy deck after Khans' release.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,kaiseresc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:52:59 2015 UTC,agree.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,kaiseresc,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:46:10 2015 UTC,It's so great that he just played this deck for the fun of it. What I liked most was the 2/3 mana curve and how well the deck was built around it. Having open 2 mana nearly all of the time shows off just how good a deck builder Newman is. Now we just have to cram Jace into it and work on the sideboard and I can see this becoming a top tier deck.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,xdest,-1,Sun Jul 19 23:45:36 2015 UTC,So when your opponent plays dromoka pre-combat how does reality shift help you?
magicTCG,3dvjy2,kala1928,3,Mon Jul 20 06:04:42 2015 UTC,Fog in response and then reality shift in your turn. It ain't pretty but it gets the job done.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Leonite7,3,Mon Jul 20 10:16:08 2015 UTC,You play your fog while Dromoka is on the stack and then Reality Shift on your turn.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,kcdragon,2,Mon Jul 20 11:16:47 2015 UTC,Sadness. I might just make and play that deck anyways.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,damnination333,3,Mon Jul 20 11:23:56 2015 UTC,"He went 6-3, which is still a solid record, especially for someone who is probably an average-level player. A little bit of tuning and better decision making could go a long way."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,gereffi,-13,Sun Jul 19 22:33:10 2015 UTC,I bought the deck after seeing it in this meta. Cost me a whole $20 with the promo scry lands!

magicTCG,3dvjy2,PittsyXD,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:01:01 2015 UTC,His token deck wreck Brad in game 2. Damn straight value in all the plays. I need help clarifying on the jace. If there 5 cards in grave yead already and when you cast jace the creature. Does he get trigger and flip rght away? Also do your opponent have the opportunity to respond by killing the creature jace before he flip to planes walker jaces?  Thanx
magicTCG,3dvjy2,iLuvHookers,3,Mon Jul 20 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"He flips during his ability, so they can respond to the loot ability. If they let you loot and there's five cards in the grave it's too late. If they say bile blight him and you respond with the flip, he lives."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,PittsyXD,2,Mon Jul 20 02:49:30 2015 UTC,Aww I thought he will come in flip if there five cards already. OK I get it now. Thanx for the info !
magicTCG,3dvjy2,iLuvHookers,4,Mon Jul 20 02:58:52 2015 UTC,"Lots of Nissa, Vastwood Seer. anyone care to start a dialog on whether she is good, bad, or somewhere in between. Personally whenever I saw her on camera it was nothing crazy, she usually just stole removal away from something like an elspeth or seige rhino. She seems like a decent threat but nothing that will just win you the game."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Credibletv,4,Mon Jul 20 03:23:15 2015 UTC,She ramps you as a creature and she has consistent card draw when she flips. She's not a blowout like Ugin is but I think her strength is more of consistency rather than straight up power
magicTCG,3dvjy2,chaanach,2,Mon Jul 20 04:47:53 2015 UTC,"She doesn't ramp, she just gets you land. Borderland Ranger and Wood Elves are two very different cards."

magicTCG,3dvjy2,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:14 2015 UTC,What's weird to me is not just the number of Nissas but the apparent increase in her numbers in the setting of languish.  Weird timing.
magicTCG,3dvjy2,adirolf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:08:31 2015 UTC,"I tested her in my Sultai midrange deck last FNM just because I bought a final prerelease box before the tournament and opened her. I have to say, every time she came out, she was quite good. She was a body when I didn't need the land and was under pressure and she was extra card draw when I was against a couple of control decks. My favorite play of the night was Nissa, drawing Dig Through Time and then into Ugin when I was against the wall against an Esper Control deck."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,magnetic_monopole,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:49:59 2015 UTC,"She's insane in Abzan. I like to describe her as a Sarkhan Unbroken who costs 3 mana and draws you a forest when she comes into play. If they remove your Nissa you still got a 2-for-1, and Elspeth ends most games anyways, so any pressure off of her is great for you."
magicTCG,3dvjy2,LightsOutAce1,4,Mon Jul 20 14:15:54 2015 UTC,were there many vids of the heroic deck in action I really want to see how that deck works in the new meta.

magicTCG,3dvjy2,bmbowdish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:30:02 2015 UTC,Can we talk about Abzan Control? What does everyone think was the best version of the list this weekend? What will be the best 75 going forward?
magicTCG,3dvjy2,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Mon Jul 20 14:22:05 2015 UTC,Abzan control generally has around 5 flex spots in the main at the moment and the sideboard is based on what you expect to see. It's hard to go wrong with the shell
magicTCG,3dvjy2,accpi,2,Mon Jul 20 06:35:19 2015 UTC,"I really like the list in 9th place. 4x Den Protector, which you are never sad to draw, 2 Nissa (who is insane), and an Ugin since Nissa helps you get to 8 lands.  Also, that was me. :)"
magicTCG,3dvjy2,LightsOutAce1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:11:17 2015 UTC,"Your list looks really nice, though the singleton Bile Blight is a little weird to me. How'd you arrive at that?"
magicTCG,3dvjy2,Cervantes3,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:39:25 2015 UTC,"I was (unreasonably) afraid of red since a friend of mine was doing well with it in testing. My sideboard was loaded up with hate (3x Arashin Cleric, 3x Drown in Sorrow), and I'm going to dial that back in the future by cutting one Drown. You often have too much sorcery speed removal and need to kill a dash guy.  I did go 3-0 against mono-red/Atarka red, though, so I can't complain. I even won a game 1 on the draw where my opening hand had 2 Thoughtseizes. :)"
magicTCG,3dvjy2,LightsOutAce1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:09:46 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! Is there anything you would change about the deck going forward? I like the inclusion of the two Nissa very much, but I also really like Tasigur. Do you think there's room for 1-2 in your list?"
magicTCG,3dvjy2,GALACTIC-SAUSAGE,2,Mon Jul 20 14:39:25 2015 UTC,"I would cut a Drown from the board (I was too afraid of red and easily went 3-0 against it), what you add is up to you. I'm going with Ultimate Price because I'm still afraid of devotion.  I cut Tasigur because he doesn't DO much - you have to spend a lot of mana to get a 2-for-1 with him, unlike your other creatures (A Lightning Helix to the face is close to a card of value in many matchups). Without Tasigur I also feel comfortable cutting Languish for End Hostilities in the main since Languish won't often be Plague Wind, which frees up a sideboard slot that was previously a second End Hostilities (you really want 2 for devotion). If you really want him you could cut the 4th Den Protector or Ugin or BB (if you're greedy) for Tasigurs. If you play Tasigur I would use Languish instead of End Hostilities in the main, but keep the one actual wrath in the sideboard and maybe add a second."

I like Tasigur plus Languish because I can wrath and have him survive, and I like the card advantage and Den Protector synergy.

I've drafted ug very well.   It seems to be open a good amount of time since people seem to think u and g ate the weakest colors.   Seems most people are going white red and black in some variations.    I stay the first few packs taking the best available.  One Draft I had celestial flare,  Unholy Hunger and willbreaker and my first few picks and didn't use either.   Best thing to do is figure out what color (s) are open and do that.

magicTCG,3dzdt7,aznsk8s87,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:07:55 2015 UTC,Compared to other sets.   The removal is lacking in number and efficiency.
magicTCG,3dzdt7,theblockhouse,3,Tue Jul 21 15:13:26 2015 UTC,"Thinking about going with a particular color before opening any packs is called ""forcing"".  It's normally a terrible idea.    The best advice I can give is to remember that you're going to end up using less than half the cards you pick, so when first starting out, just grab the best card in the pack.  Once you see a few packs, you would have seen what sort of thing is going around the table, which could indicate that something isn't being taken by someone else.    If you open something really cool, don't try to make it work, just grab good cards.  You're almost definitely going to have a two color deck.  Playing a few bad cards so you're only in one color is worse than just having two colors, where every card is at least ""pretty good"".    For this particular set, people are putting too much emphasis on how good white is, so most of the decent white stuff will probably be taken before it gets to you.  Same can be said for green.  Black and blue will probably be passed a lot.  But again, don't take bad cards just because they're available.    Oh, and have fun.  The whole point of draft is to play in a casual environment."

magicTCG,3dzdt7,MTGCardFetcher,2,Mon Jul 20 21:30:39 2015 UTC,"A good way to start is to pick the best card in the pack for the first 2-3 picks, and figure out from there what seems open at your table (what good cards are left in the packs for particular colors/strategies).  If there are two cards that are close early on, then it's usually better to go with the card that shares a color with another good card you have."
magicTCG,3dzdt7,alcaizin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:52:39 2015 UTC,"lrcast.com - listening to the set reviews are very helpful, and all of their shows are very informative.   As for your questions, I usually take the best card available in the pack for the first pack, and then pick cards based on what I've chosed already. If I have a bunch of good cards in red, then I'll prioritize red in packs two and three, over maybe slightly better cards in other colors. When all is said and done you typically want to be in two colors, though one is possible, and three is possible sometimes, though going mono colored, or tricolored can be difficult.   take removal highly It typically take removal over most cards unless they are bombs. - Black has two instant speed destroy creature cards at 5 mana. they are both very good. Red has burn cards which are all good in my experience. Green has a fight card. White has some conditional destroy creatures, and supression bonds which are pretty good. Finally blue has claustrophobia, and a bunch of tempo (not true removal).  Sentinel of the Eternal Watch is a white uncommon which plays like a mythic in limited. It's big, bomby, and can win games on its own.  Use the vanilla test (mana cost compared to power and toughness) for creatures. This isn't set in stone, but nobody wants a 5 mana 1/4 that doesn't do anything. If a creature seems overcosted, it could be the ability it offers is valuable. An example of a good card that doesn't do very well on the vanilla test is Possessed Skaab it is a 5 mana 3/2 which isn't great, but when it enters it essentially draws you a card which is very nice, and makes it a very good card.   Hopefully this helps, and remember the most important thing is to have fun. Most people don't win their first time out, and learning is part of the game. I typically ask my opponents if they noticed any obvious misplays that i did after the game."

Thus, that player earns 3 match points and 6 game points. A player’s byes are ignored when computing his or her opponents’ match-win and opponents’ game-win percentages.   edit: While it doesn't directly affect your tiebreakers, byes could hurt you if would have otherwise been paired with and won against an opponent with a higher game-win percentage."
magicTCG,3dzcm7,DrLemniscate,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:36:26 2015 UTC,"Rounds vs. the bye don't count any resistance. So if you get a bye, only the resistance of your other opponents will count towards your resistance.

magicTCG,3dzcm7,nilamo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:40:43 2015 UTC,"It's silly, but it happens. Especially in really small events when people start dropping.  You have 7 people. So already, randomly, someone is getting a 1st round bye. Now you have 4 1-0s and 3 0-1s. One of the 0-1s gets a bye.  Now you have 2 2-0s, 4 1-1s and 1 0-2. And from what he said, the 0-2 dropped and a 1-1  that didn't get the bye dropped. So you still have an odd number of people. 2 2-0s and 3 1-1s. The 2-0s play each other and the other bit gets weird. If the 1-1 bye guy played one of the other 1-1s, then if that guy gets selected to be paired, he can only be paired with the third 1-1 since he played the guy with the bye. That means the guy with the bye is left without an opponent through no fault of his own, so he gets another bye.  Now, if you had more people, there would be more people available to pair against and the byes would be more evenly spread about the players."

magicTCG,3dzcm7,bautin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:30:27 2015 UTC,"It's a bit more work to go through all the rounds of the event. Then there is the situations in larger events where someone who is like 1-4 only due to the bye is still in the event and everyone else is 2-3 or better and has been paired. You give that guy the bye, it's the fairest to all competitors in that regard.  And I say random, but I don't think it's truly random, it's just whatever record happens to be first when they get the players from the database."

magicTCG,3dz6ip,mc-lunar,2,Mon Jul 20 18:56:45 2015 UTC,I think it's quite obvious that 60 cards is not the optimal build. Having a pool deep enough to play a 60 card deck is just so rare that I wanted to do try it.
magicTCG,3dz6ip,mc-lunar,2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe I'm missing something, but were you only running one red source?"
magicTCG,3dz6ip,mc-lunar,2,Mon Jul 20 23:44:15 2015 UTC,"No, you're not missing anything. I failed to add the right manabase. I drafted the deck as monowhite and picked up some red cards along the way. In deckbuilding I decided to try playing all 60 and my head was still stuck on mono white.  Made for some interesting game 1s, but g2 and g3 was fine."
magicTCG,3dz54x,cuvob66,2,Mon Jul 20 18:36:11 2015 UTC,Congrats! It feels so good to pull cards that you really want.
magicTCG,3dz54x,Moldy_pirate,2,Mon Jul 20 19:41:59 2015 UTC,Nice pulls man! Day's undoing and the bear thing are sweet too.

magicTCG,3dz54x,alcaizin,5,Mon Jul 20 18:45:27 2015 UTC,Wrong.  They are fine in .self text post format.
magicTCG,3dvak9,gwax,32,Sun Jul 19 20:36:05 2015 UTC,I'm personally a fan of Deckbox.
magicTCG,3dvak9,yesithinkalot,6,Sun Jul 19 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Deckbox. I wish it had better deck building tools like Tapped Out, but it's the best tool I've found for tracking your collection."
magicTCG,3dvak9,InvisibleMan5,5,Sun Jul 19 23:00:03 2015 UTC,"Third for Deckbox. Only issue I've had with it is that adding +2 of a card is kinda strange, and can sometimes not save."
magicTCG,3dvak9,Jademalo,9,Sun Jul 19 23:18:35 2015 UTC,My biggest complaint about Deckbox is that it's difficult to get it to track what version of a card is in what deck.
magicTCG,3dvak9,Noonites,3,Sun Jul 19 23:29:53 2015 UTC,"Yes, I definitely agree. As someone who keeps their prebuilt decks together, adding the cards on there makes everything a little messy."
magicTCG,3dvak9,Jademalo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:30:51 2015 UTC,"Deckbox is a great site for collection tracking, but I wish they had stayed out of the card selling market. Ever since they dipped into monetizing the site, and subsequently lost access to tcgplayer pricing data, it's become a lot more difficult to see the actual cost of your cards for personal or trading purposes.  Deckbox can sometimes be days... with an ""s"" behind the current pricing on cards."
magicTCG,3dvak9,OutofStep,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:16:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I tried Deckbox, and I'm sure that it's good for some people's needs but it didn't work for me.  I have, by current count, 28,412 cards and the process for adding cards to a collection with Deckbox is too slow and tedious for my taste.  Certainly, one of the things I would like to do eventually is make my csv export work for import into Deckbox and other sites but Deckbox doesn't currently have a particularly detailed or robust csv import system."
magicTCG,3dvak9,citizenray,2,Mon Jul 20 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"Nor is their export particularly scriptable (I have a hackmess of python exporting a CSV for me nightly). Try talking to them on twitter, though - they're pretty responsive."
magicTCG,3dvak9,mtg_liebestod,0,Mon Jul 20 01:42:08 2015 UTC,"I actually wrote a python script so that I just enter cards into a spreadsheet and then it parses the spreadsheet into a text file of the type Deckbox likes (notably, you don't want to make a .csv file unless you want to overwrite your old inventory.)  I do wish Deckbox had an inventory management API, however."
magicTCG,3dvak9,pyromosh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:19:10 2015 UTC,"I have, by current count, 28,412 cards and the process for adding cards to a collection with Deckbox is too slow and tedious for my taste.   Your GitHub page and what you've said here still leave me unclear.  Let's say I'm a user in a similar situation starting from scratch.  How is your application superior?  How does it beat Deckbox from a ease of entry perspective?  I'm a (bad) developer.  I'm fairly tech savvy.  But if I'm Random J. User, why should I try to install a scary sounding snake software and configure this from GitHub, instead of falling into the user-friendly arms of DeckBox?  Just to clarify - I'm not picking on you here.  These are honest questions.  Mass entry is one of the biggest barriers for this class of software.  How is your solution better?"
magicTCG,3dvak9,pyromosh,2,Mon Jul 20 03:57:54 2015 UTC,"Frankly, if you're Random J. User, this might not be the best option for you.  The target audience is more technically savvy power users.  Ultimately, I needed a solution for myself and couldn't find one I liked so I made my own. The goal was to make my life easier. That goal served, I figured that I might as well share the results on the off chance someone else finds it useful."
magicTCG,3dvak9,pyromosh,2,Mon Jul 20 05:26:32 2015 UTC,"Okay, Random J. User, aside - my question still stands.  How is your solution better from a mass card entry perspective?  What does your application do to help that problem vs. Deckbox or similar?"
magicTCG,3dvak9,innocii,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:23:09 2015 UTC,"Last I checked, with Deckbox, and most of the other collection managers, you need to choose to add a card, select the card from a list, enter the quantity, add, repeat; which is usually quite a few clicks/keypresses. Or, you can enter a list of cards but then you have to type the quantity and the name for each, which is also a lot of keypresses. Either way, you spend a lot more time inputing than counting.  With a spreadsheet, you just type a number, press the down arrow, repeat; two keypresses per card within a set. The data entry goes quite quickly, especially if you can remember a sequence of a few cards in a row.  Have you taken a look at the sample output spreadsheet?"
magicTCG,3dvak9,innocii,2,Mon Jul 20 08:01:58 2015 UTC,"I hadn't.  And I think I misunderstood.  So the tool itself just generates that spreadsheet and doesn't do the entry of card quantities at all?  It just generates a spreadsheet of all the cards ever printed and says ""go have fun"" to the user?  The use case is basically ""Find what sets your cards are from, go to the appropriate workbook, then enter a quantity for each card you have""?  Is this correct?"
magicTCG,3dvak9,Kominyetska,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:33:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And then when new sets come around, the tool will update your spreadsheet while preserving counts."
magicTCG,3dvak9,Kominyetska,2,Mon Jul 20 13:19:29 2015 UTC,"I've taken a look at your sample spreadsheet.  While the installation worked fine for me on Windows I had to adjust the commands to adhere to Windows norm (cutting the leading ""./"").  After generating the spreadsheet I opened it and Excel confronted me with the message: ""This sheet is corrupted, wanna try repairing?"". I let it repair it. But it said it couldn't do so and I should use more RAM or a 64Bit Excel (which it already should be?).  Anyways after that episode I thought the file would be goners, but alas I could open it and I entered a few cards from different sets.  But how am I supposed to enter Promos and Foils with a glossy date on the picture? There is a column ""others"", but from the Excel code it looks like that'll show card from a different set if I had entered them."
magicTCG,3dvak9,Schaef93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:38:47 2015 UTC,"The ""others"" column does exactly what you think it does.  The trick to promos is that they aren't from the set that you think they are from. Prerelease promos are from the set pPRE, FNM promos are from pFNM, other promo sets can be found by taking a look at the ""Sets"" page.  Generally, I use http://magiccards.info alongside my spreadsheet for search and lookup.  As for the problems you're running into, I'm sorry; I currently only have the ability to test the created files in LibreOffice on OSX and Excel mobile on my phone. I've started running into some performance issues on my phone after fully populating and it looks like the ""others"" column might be to blame. I'm taking a look at streamlining that right now."
magicTCG,3dvak9,ardeay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:31:17 2015 UTC,I would have never expected that many sets. But after 20(?) years of MtG it's not surprising either. I think office just has problems with these super big files.
magicTCG,3dvak9,uniquee1,2,Mon Jul 20 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems that stripping the ""others"" calculation from Basic lands helps a lot so I'm going to push that soon and see if I can do anything else to simplify the ""others"" equation."
magicTCG,3dvak9,ITOverlord,4,Mon Jul 20 14:05:49 2015 UTC,DeckedBuilder will let you export your collection or individual decks as a CSV.
magicTCG,3dvak9,ITOverlord,2,Sun Jul 19 23:03:03 2015 UTC,"Yup, but slow data entry and lack of Linux supports fail to meet my needs."
magicTCG,3dvak9,ardeay,2,Mon Jul 20 01:13:08 2015 UTC,"Oh, you didn't say in the OP anything about needing Linux support. I find the video scanning of cards to be quite fast (about 1/sec) versus having to type the names or search for checkboxes on a set list."
magicTCG,3dvak9,Little_Gray,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:37:01 2015 UTC,"I didn't really specify my requirements because I didn't really want to badmouth any of the other options out there.  Mostly, I wanted fast input, support on any platform (mostly Android, OSX, Linux), and not to be dependent on anything proprietary for access or updates; I've been burned a couple of times in the past by collection managers losing support and no longer getting updates, while also not being able to export to something new.  As for entry speed, I already have all of my cards sorted in the same sort order as the spreadsheets that are generated so adding cards to a collection is as simple as going through the box, remembering a sequence of a few (like 4, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1), then typing a number, pressing down and repeating. Sorting was a huge pain but, once they were sorted, it only took me a few minutes per set to catalog things in the spreadsheets."

magicTCG,3dvak9,ardeay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:25:46 2015 UTC,"There's no name typing necessary. The tool generates a spreadsheet with all of the cards pre-populated. All you have to do is fill in numbers in the empty ""copies"" or ""foils"" columns.  EDIT: conjugation"
magicTCG,3dvak9,Little_Gray,2,Mon Jul 20 05:29:13 2015 UTC,"At somewhere near 100k cards, I've given up on cataloging. I just have them separated into  Standard (all) Modern (Playable) Legacy (Playable) and 'The rest'."
magicTCG,3dvak9,zorlot,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:57 2015 UTC,I think it's only stubborn obsession that keeps me tracking things. Though it's nice to have an easy way to avoid having more than 4 of anything.
magicTCG,3dvak9,Snake973,2,Mon Jul 20 22:55:22 2015 UTC,Yeah... I know for a fact I have a ton of just junk cards in the 20s-30s of.
magicTCG,3dvak9,mtg_liebestod,2,Tue Jul 21 04:03:48 2015 UTC,It made me really happy to free up the space. I didn't get a ton for them but it was enough to pick up a few key Legacy staples I've been meaning to pick up.

magicTCG,3dvak9,ardeay,5,Sun Jul 19 23:27:43 2015 UTC,Its a nice website but it tracks every card individually which makes it really bad for anything but the smallest collections.
magicTCG,3dvak9,Schaef93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:29:56 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make sense. I'm not familiar with this site, but PucaTrade does something similar and it's easy to just upload/export a spreadsheet of all your cards.  Not tracking individual cards separately is actually probably a bad idea from a pure software architecture perspective. Imagine you want to be able to upload pictures of different copies of your card - you need to have that functionality one way or another. I think sites like Deckbox are limited by not doing this."
magicTCG,3dvak9,ardeay,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:22:34 2015 UTC,Yes its not a big deal for importing/exporting the first time but it also means its a lot more work to adjust your inventory as you go.  Having them all individually listed means its also harder to track the exact number of a card you have especially when there is 10+ copies.    Uploading pictures of different copies of your cards not actually feasible for any decent sized collection as it would be incredibly time consuming and unnecessary.  What is far far more important is being able to track the condition of your cards.
magicTCG,3dvak9,lonestar34,0,Mon Jul 20 03:46:40 2015 UTC,"Uploading pictures of different copies of your cards not actually feasible for any decent sized collection as it would be incredibly time consuming and unnecessary.   Obviously no one would do this for every card in a large collection. It'd just be nice if, say, I could tag a card with a photo if I'm expecting to trade it online. The photo would follow the trade ID.   Having them all individually listed means its also harder to track the exact number of a card you have especially when there is 10+ copies.   Not sure if we're on the same page here. You can give cards individual IDs but still aggregate them as a matter of UI convenience. If you're just complaining about UIs that list cards individually, then okay."

It's an easier sweep against thopters and the like, since it doesn't require having a creature, it's a little cheaper, and playing elves is hella fun and makes this one-sided unless they also run elves(so draft those elves dry).

Either of those leave their colors wide open for you.  If you take any white card, the person downstream of you will still be picking white, and a similar situation exists in blue.

Double red is not easy to splash and in this format you won't be splashing anyway unless your draft is a trainwreck or if you're splashing for your second colour which doesn't seem very likely.  Akroan Jailer also definitely wheels since it's in the bottom 2 cards of the pack and Kytheon's Tactics might also wheel since this pack has 9 cards I'd rate higher and Act of Treason which I might also rate higher if I've got any sort of synergy for it.  The reason I'd pick Chandra's Ignition is because it's more powerful than the Lieutenant and asks less of your deck, it only needs a couple reasonable sized creatures to be a great spell while the lieutenant needs an aggressive and heavy white deck."

magicTCG,3e1hps,MTGCardFetcher,5,Tue Jul 21 06:06:09 2015 UTC,"Your friend is playing the card correctly! I wonder how many other times you feel he ""bends"" the rules when he is, in fact, using the card as intended.   Playing any card, other than a land, from your hand is ""casting"" a ""spell"". Creatures are ""creature spells"" when you are in the act of playing them from your hand to the battlefield. When you play a spell, it goes on ""the stack"", and the opponent may play instants in response.   Counterspells will counter the spell you are in the process of casting. Bones to Dust is just like any other counterspell except it's only for creature spells and not instants/sorceries/etc. When a spell is countered, the card is put into the graveyard. You do not get your mana back, you do not get any ""when this creature enters the battlefield"" abilities. Counterspells target spells being cast and do not affect abilities on cards.  Counterspells are not fun to play against, but this is how they work. Some creature cards will have ""cannot be countered"" as part of their card text, so if your friend likes to counter spells you can try to find a few uncounterable creatures to turn the tables."
magicTCG,3e1hps,Redshift2k5,2,Tue Jul 21 06:13:40 2015 UTC,You friend is right. Counters stops the spell from resolving and puts it directly into the graveyard from the stack. It never hits the battlefield
magicTCG,3e1hps,jabber-,2,Tue Jul 21 06:08:57 2015 UTC,"To answer your first question, let's look at the definition of the terms ""card"", ""spell"" and ""creature"" as they pertain to Magic.  From the Comprehensive Rules:   108.2a: In the text of spells or abilities, the term ""card"" is used only to refer to a card that's not on the battlefield or on the stack, such as a creature card in a player's hand. For more information, see section 4, ""Zones.""   So when [[Elvish Mystic]] is in my hand, graveyard, library or in exile it is a creature card.   111.1. A spell is a card on the stack. As the first step of being cast (see rule 601, ""Casting Spells""), the card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually its owner's hand. (See rule 405, ""Stack."") A spell remains on the stack as a spell until it resolves (see rule 608, ""Resolving Spells and Abilities""), is countered (see rule 701.5), or otherwise leaves the stack. For more information, see section 6, ""Spells, Abilities, and Effects.""    and   110.4b The term ""permanent spell"" is used to refer to a spell that will enter the battlefield as a permanent as part of its resolution. Specifically, it means an artifact, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell.    Which means that when I cast [[Elvish Mystic]] from my hand, it stops being a creature card, and becomes a creature spell.   302.2. When a creature spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under his or her control.    At which point my [[Elvish Mystic]] becomes a creature.  Finally!  I can beat down for 1!  The card your friend is using is likely [[Bone to Ash]].  It's rules text reads:   Counter target creature spell.  Draw a card.   Now, as we know from 111.1, any card on the stack is a spell (lands do not go on the stack).  110.4b clarifies further, by defining ""permanent spell"".  In this case, ""creature spell"" refers to ""any creature card that has been put onto the stack"".  A card that read:   Counter target creature.   would actually be useless (Wouldn't that be nice? Leave my [[Elvish Mystic]] alone!).  For the card to kill your creature, it would have to read:   Destroy target creature.   A creature only ""dies"" when it is put into the graveyard from the battlefield (700.4. The term dies means “is put into a graveyard from the battlefield.”)  An example of a spell that does this would be [[Unholy Hunger]].    A real life example of Unholy Hunger is what happens when you put me in a small room with a large pie.  And now after that [[Great Wall]] of text, I've answered all of your questions your first question.  For an answer to your second question, hop on a [[Juggernaut]] and skip to here!  Let's look at the full definition of an ability from the comprehensive rules, all 12 subsections of section 112, the section on Abilities!  On second thought, let's just look at 112.3c, which covers the ability of your [[Aven Battle Priest]] (""When Aven Battle Priest enters the battlefield, you gain 3 life."") It reads:   112.3c Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as ""[Trigger condition], [effect],"" and include (and usually begin with) the word ""when,"" ""whenever,"" or ""at."" Whenever the trigger event occurs, the ability is put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority and stays there until it's countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule 603, ""Handling Triggered Abilities.""    Now, let's look again at the rules text of [[Bone to Ash]]:   Counter target creature spell.  Draw a card.   The triggered ability on [[Aven Battle Priest]] is not a creature spell, and thus your friend cannot cast [[Bone to Ash]] targeting it.  An example of a spell that could counter [[Aven Battle Priest]]'s triggered ability would be [[Stifle]], which reads:   Counter target activated or triggered ability. (Mana abilities can't be targeted.)   Targeting [[Aven Battle Priest]] with [[Bone to Ash]] while [[Aven Battle Priest]] is on the stack will put [[Aven Battle Priest]] from the stack into the graveyard.  It never enters the battlefield, and its ability never triggers.  I hope this has answered your second question.  If you want to avoid [[Circular Logic]], and just want an answer to your third question, skip to here.  This is an Internet Relay Chat with real Magic: The Gathering judges.  They will answer any rules questions you have, live, in real time.  This is a hyperlinked version of the Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules.

That's what happens when you don't know the rules.  Either you thought something was bad so you didn't use it and it was actually good or you thought something was good so you did it and it was actually bad.    The solution to rules lawyers is to learn the rules. All of them. There is a document called the comprehensive rules, and it covers in fine detail how every mechanic in the game works. No it's not arcane garbage no one actually knows - it's something many people reference regularly and some people read the whole thing. Reading it should give you a better understanding of the rules as long as you don't try and interpret your own meaning in it. There is no interpreting it. The statements it makes are absolute.

No matter how you buy your cards, each pack only has a 1/8 chance of having a mythic.  There's no set amount in each box, so buying the boosters in different manners will have no effect on the probability."
magicTCG,3dwdln,RangerBillXX,10,Mon Jul 20 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"Not quite, there are print runs of booster boxes. That's how box mapping works. Granted, WotC has become a lot better at (partly) randomizing their boxes lately, but you still have some pattern to which rares occur in the same box.  If you take one booster each from 36 different boxes you'll get the result you indicated. But if you take all 36 boosters from one box you don't have a (1/8)36 chance of opening all mythics, you have a zero chance at opening all mythics, because there's no box with all mythics.  That being said, OP should go ahead a draft a booster box. It's fine, it's how most people do it anyways. (What shop would open more boxes before the first one is empty?)"
magicTCG,3dwdln,Gruul_and_Unusual,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:21:42 2015 UTC,"(1/8)36 = 0, anyway -- at least, for all practical purposes.  If every person on earth opened 36 truly random boosters, not a single one of 'em would get 36 mythics."
magicTCG,3dwdln,jsweet4979,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:09 2015 UTC,"While what you're saying isn't precisely accurate, the spirit is correct. Buying a box will lower the variance of number of mythics you can get, but will not affect the overall probability.  I think OP should realize that while buying a box decreases the ceiling on number of possible mythics, it also raises the floor. If he buys a bunch of loose packs (and can verify they are unsearched which itself isn't easy) then there is just as good a chance he will get no mythics at all as getting more mythics than usual."
magicTCG,3dwdln,cbslinger,2,Mon Jul 20 12:14:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure buying a box really lowers the variance?  Wizards does not discuss collation, but my impression is they've gotten good enough at it that these days, for all intents and purposes, you can treat a booster box as being 36 ""random"" packs (even though strictly speaking it's not)."
magicTCG,3dwdln,jsweet4979,10,Mon Jul 20 14:00:04 2015 UTC,"Either split the cost of a box, or have one person buy the box under the stipulation that they get to keep all the cards.  Mythics don't show up that often (one out of every 8 packs on average, about 4 per box), so don't worry about that too much if you're focused on drafting. Having one person buy the box and keep the cards means that you don't have to worry about who gets what mythics, as well as means that people are less likely to rare draft."
magicTCG,3dwdln,RavenHusky,2,Mon Jul 20 02:25:23 2015 UTC,"We also buy booster boxes, and after drafting roughly distribute the rares by value among the players. If two want the same card, whoever performed better in the draft gets the card. Works for us"

magicTCG,3dwdln,joyjoy88,2,Mon Jul 20 12:25:53 2015 UTC,"I think what you're missing here is that the value of a set is not all in the mythics. A lot of rares especially for current sets are more valuable (and playable) than some mythics, see e.g. Collected Company or Siege Rhino vs. Descent of the Dragons or Pearl Lake Ancient. In M15, Stoke the Flames was more valuable than Jace, Living Guildpact!  I would advise buying a complete box, because that will usually make the packs much cheaper compared to buying individually."
magicTCG,3dwdln,taumxd,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:29 2015 UTC,"I guess it comes down to what you mean by ""lowering the cost of the draft"" ???? If your goal is to get the cheapest price for the 24? packs you need for your draft, then buying a box will be the cheapest option for that. If it goes beyond that, like you're talking about the ""net"" cost of the draft, as in the money you each put in for the box, less what you get for selling your sweet mythics you pull, then to make that ""fairer"" you could do a rare re-draft after you've done your draft, so the person who won the draft gets first pick of all the rares opened, then second, and so on. At least that's my opinion on that kind of system."
magicTCG,3dwdln,chammy82,0,Mon Jul 20 11:48:17 2015 UTC,"Okay, here's a little bit of math: Each box guarantees you 3-5 mythics. At $100 for a box, you get 36 packs. Let's assume 7 other people are coming to the draft and you're in charge. Charge $9-$11 per person. Have some sort of prize support. Be it sample decks from your LGS, packs, or their choice of X commons from leftover packs you open (because you paid $30, so you get 12 packs more). I honestly don't know if anything I'm saying is making sense. I just held a draft today with my friends and all of these ideas I've talked about have been tested. I don't recommend phantom drafting, because then you just basically bought a box and have nothing to do with it."

That means that the flip ability will work like you want with it returning a flipped Gideon since it does in fact go to exile and not anywhere else.

If you are trying to race (and you often are) you need at least a few. -Defiant strike: great trick the card draw is really nice (especially after the scry from Battle wise, or aqueous form) -I agree with cheatonus about dropping pantheon for Iroas.  If you want two more creatures for the other Iroas, look at [[seeker of the way]].  This is just me, but Valorous stance is one of my favorite white cards that is currently in standard.  I adore that card, and it has done a ton of work for me.  If you have any interest in playing white for the remainder of it's time in standard, I think it's worth it."

If you can't afford more Strands or Temples run the gain lands and the Jeskai tri-lands. You need white, you want blue.  Maindeck one counterspell. Stubborn, Negate, something.

magicTCG,3dxq7w,colacadstink,4,Mon Jul 20 12:23:07 2015 UTC,"Do the math for your store owner.  Take the cost of entry, multiply it by the number of people playing, and then subtract out the cost of any prizes given out. If the store's making any extra money on this, it's bad value. Every store I've seen is able to make enough profit off of packs being sold at $4/pack (or less!) in tournaments that they're able to stay afloat; unless your store is in some weird situation, this should work for them as well.  I had this problem with a local store of mine - they were charging $10 for 3 rounds of Standard, with each player getting a pack per win, and a bonus of (players/2) packs for first. When you run the numbers on that, that's each player paying $5/pack in the prize pool! I pointed this out to the store owner, who went ""...hunh, that's not right"", and then promptly changed the payout to be two packs per win (with no bonus). Which is far more fair at about $3.33/pack in the pool.  Do the math, make sure it checks out, and tell your store owner if it doesn't. Make the point (if you need to and can) that it'd be cheaper for you to just buy the packs from the store then run an informal tournament, than it would to play in an official one run by the store. Hopefully this will make them realize that players actually care about value."

magicTCG,3dxq7w,velocazachtor,2,Mon Jul 20 14:34:04 2015 UTC,Mine is based on player attendance. We have seen 12 packs for first or 4 packs just depending on how many are playing and what the event is.
magicTCG,3dxq7w,RedHatGamer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:05:43 2015 UTC,So is it like a sliding scale or how does it get decided? Also is it only for first or is there prizes for say 2nd/3rd/4th?
magicTCG,3dxq7w,NightHawk521,2,Mon Jul 20 12:06:53 2015 UTC,"My store has a set pay scale, depending on number of attendees. More or less, half of all packs go to first, then 1/4 to second and so on until they run out of packs."
magicTCG,3dxq7w,ramandur,2,Mon Jul 20 13:07:51 2015 UTC,No real scale just whatever the shop owner deems fair. And yes prizes through third always. sometimes down beyond third.
magicTCG,3dxq7w,NightHawk521,2,Mon Jul 20 13:14:25 2015 UTC,Mine does a 4-2-1-1 for 8 man draft pods (scaled up or down to the best of their abilities). To me I think that's fair even if it is a little top heavy. However for the last few months there has only been 2 promos given out per pod (first + random out of the bottom 4). I think it should be 4 per cause the lgs should be getting 10/week and has 2 fnms and 2 gamedays listed. It's really frustrating.
magicTCG,3dxq7w,Polythello,2,Mon Jul 20 12:34:41 2015 UTC,They might not realize the rules changed earlier this year. My store was just doing the 4 until I showed them the website showing that they can distribute the full 10 allotment at 1 fnm and didn't have to have both fire

They also provide the promo to 1st place and anyone who was undefeated (in rounds, not games).  So first place has the potential to get 3 packs + promo, or you can place 10th and still win 1 pack, etc."
magicTCG,3dxq7w,HafroThunder,2,Mon Jul 20 13:15:39 2015 UTC,On MY LGS it depends on how many people plays. He charges $5 per player and I have seen prizes up to the top 8. and then 2 random boosters and 2 random promos. Promos for 1st and 2nd

I play at Channel Fireball game center and they do $10 for draft, pack per win, all 3-0s get a promo. Sealed is $15(!) for the same deal.  CFB, probably more than (or at least as much as) any other shop, runs drafts as a loss leader to get people in the door. There's no way they are making money on a $15 sealed + prize support, but the more people they have in the store opening packs and potentially buying and selling singles, the better for them (for context they can easily get 50+ people in a draft and they run some kind of limited event (sometimes multiple) every day."

They seem like a really good choice for a first pair of decks.  Still, the biggest problem is that those decks only contain 1 copy of their best cards.

Narset doesn't see play because she doesn't fit well into any existing decks.  She has a very real deck construction cost if you want her +1 to be reliable card advantage.  She lines up poorly against Hero's Downfall if you don't get a card from her +1.  Also, she fits best into control decks, and the premier control deck of the most recent Standard format was creature-based (Esper Dragons) and didn't need the extra source of CA or win-condition."

They haven't risen astronomically, for the most part. In fact, some of them are still in their post-rotation dip. It could be a long time until you see a significant return on investment with the fetches, especially with the likelihood of the rest of the cycle being reprinted in less than three months. Unless you plan on holding onto them for a few years, the Khans fetches aren't really something you want to pick up as an investment right now.

magicTCG,3dwr47,Aiokii,12,Mon Jul 20 04:21:36 2015 UTC,"This highlights the importance of testing. There's a good reason that whenever anyone posts asking for advice on their deck, the necessary first question (that posters almost never answer in advance) is: What are the results of your testing against tier decks?   If the answer is ""I haven't done any testing against tier decks."", then that needs to happen before anything worthwhile can be said.   If a deck has been worked on for ""eight years"", like the article here says, then goes to a tournament and gets ""quickly dispatched"" and that's not the expected result, then I'm forced to conclude that the majority of those years were wasted theory crafting and not testing.   Brewing up wacky decks is awesome and fun, but you expecting to brew up a wacky deck that wins is very ambitious. That rarely happens to anyone.   Test your decks!"

They are just better than 80% of the people you meet at a store. It comes from practice and other things. Sometimes you have to recognize that whomever is playing against you needs to be as good as the average player or better to get a good idea about how a deck should work overall. That isnt the case for most players. The ""opposition"" player, who picks up whatever decks and throws down should be one of the better players in the group."
magicTCG,3dwr47,akaWhitey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:07:41 2015 UTC,"If it was viable to build competitive constructed decks in this manner then the metagame would be as diverse as one could imagine.  However, there's a reason those top decks are at the top.  They're the best most refined builds for the meta, and they're built and tested by people who have far more time to do so than most of us.  Rogue builds are for the kitchen table, and it's highly rare they're good anywhere else.  From what I've seen rogue builds that do carry some viability are generally just variations of an existing archetype with a few cute (and generally cheaper) cards substituted for more staple ones.  I think if you want to build creatively in Magic there are a few options, drafting, kitchen table, and EDH.  In other words, casual magic is the place for creative deck building.  Anytime I start having a brainstorm about building a new deck the first question I ask is... is there already a deck that is competitive that does what I'm trying to do with this deck?  The answer is almost always, yes!  Why reinvent the wheel?  If it's just a way you get your jollies, then fine, but it shouldn't lead to frustration at the LGS when things go pear shaped.  You should have the expectation that your build is probably not competitive."

To quote the article from when color indicators came about:   Oh, as to why this is in the functional changes section? Well, there are a few small differences, but we've decided we're comfortable with them. One, they're all losing an ability, so some of those cards will have a newfound appreciation for Muraganda Petroglyphs. Two, cards like Mind Bend that change one color word into another won't affect the color of these cards. Three, Evermind no longer turns the spells it's spliced onto blue. Really, how weird was that? Four, Dryad Arbor behaves a little differently under a Blood Moon. Previously, it would become colorless. No, really. (In layer 4, it becomes a Mountain and thus loses all of its abilities, including the one that would make it green in layer 5.) Now, because color indicator is not an ability it can lose, it remains green. It ain't easy, but we think Dryad Arbor will be just fine."

Subtypes (things to the right of the dash) are intrinsically tied to a Type (things to the left of the dash). For example, the current list of valid Land Subtypes is:   Desert, Forest, Island, Lair, Locus, Mine, Mountain, Plains, Power-Plant, Swamp, Tower, and Urza's   Since these are all subtypes of Land, you won't ever see those on cards that aren't Land. There's no such thing as a Creature - Mine, or a Creature - Locus (and for the sake of Legacy, I hope there never is!), only Lands.  The list of Creature subtypes is.. appreciably larger, and I won't post it here (You can look it up in the Comp. Rules, section 205.3 has all lists of all legal Subtypes.). But Forest is not on it, because Forest is defined as a Land subtype. Changelings have all Creature types, but not all Land types, and the two don't cross over just because they were both on the same card.  For a similar situation, look at Tribal cards. They have Creature subtypes (Well, technically, they have Tribal subtypes; the list of Tribal subtypes is identical to Creatures), but Eldrazi isn't a valid Instant, Sorcery, or Enchantment type, even though it's on all three of those card types. It's on the cards because of their Tribal type.  This got a bit messier than I'd hoped, but maybe that helped clarify a bit?  TL;DR subtypes are defined by which list they're on in the rules, not which cards they've been printed on."

Edit: additionally, the mana base for ""fair"" decks (every deck is broken af in this format anyway) would consist of  12x Urzatron  4x Ancient Tomb  4x Ghost Quarter (because no one plays basics)  4x Wasteland (same idea as quarter)  1× Island (credit to Bestach) (to fetch out when quartered; also Island is the strongest basic)"

Cruel ultimatum could be a slightly more plausible finisher. Decks that would have been spread thin become much more consistent, like 4 color gifts gains insane consistency, and can even go 5 color for bolts and keranos. I feel like waste not storm could be a thing since you don't have to filter away from black. Zoo just becomes tribal zoo, burn becomes tribal burn."

A bounce spell is pure card disadvantage -- you spend a card bouncing it, then another card dealing with it later.  A control deck needs to grind an opponent out of resources, and two for oneing yourself is the exact opposite of what you should be doing.  Black gives you access to fantastic kill spells, and you should be using them -- my U/B list has 10 main deck kill spells, not counting the 4 main deck sweepers, and I still bring in a few more against aggro post board.  Sometimes aggro will just run over a control deck, but you need to trade one for one to preserve your life, and then set up for a sweeper to deal with several threats with a single card.  Only after that do you take control of the game, and only if your opponent can't rebuild faster than you can deal with their new wave of threats."

If you're under that same illusion that netdecking is bad, I implore you to rethink your position. Magic is a game requiring tremendous skill. I can hand the same Tier 1 deck to sixteen people and run a single elimination tournament five times and I bet you there will be very little variation in the top four players (until maybe the last tournament, where all of the less good players have witnessed the correct way to play a deck.)  Netdecking is the best possible thing you can do. It teaches you proper deck structuring (good mana to spell ratios for example), how to evaluate cards and scenarios (certain cards in decks will literally have one to two uses only) and will generally make you a better deck builder in the future.   To me, there's no difference in getting a list off of the internet and asking a good player or a buddy to help you build a deck."

If I had to guess, I'd say there's a correlation between population density, average income levels, and eternal format popularity (although that might not be the case).  The Northeastern US has a pretty big scene - I live in Massachusetts, and nearly every store in my area runs Legacy once a week.  I could probably play nearly every day if I wanted to.  It's likely going to be difficult for Legacy and Vintage to take off in areas that didn't have a large Magic-playing population when the cards were much cheaper - there just aren't going to be the requisite number of duals and other staples nearby for purchase.  Obviously buying online is a thing, but not being able to build credit towards expensive staples may discourage people."

I wouldn't say the player base is going down though.  On the other hand, I'd say there's actually been a huge explosion in the Vintage player base, although most people don't notice since it was so small to begin with. Mox Boarding House started running monthly Vintage FNMs this year, and it's gotten more local players into the format.

Vintage at gen con and eternal weekend also has a growing tournament base. I get together with 3 other people couple times a month and there are over 8 of us in town with power now where there was only 3 people two years ago. I think mtgo has spurned a lot of interest. The large vintage tournaments are getting bigger and im finding more and more people to play with. Heck my buddy bought graded power and removed it from the cases to play with us. So im feeling the opposite. I know a lot less people online talking about legacy as they dont get to watch it every sunday now but our monthly tournament still gets about 50 players and as high as 105 if there isnt a pptq open or gp near by.

magicTCG,3dyxoj,suicidebaneling,0,Mon Jul 20 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"This will vary from zone to zone. We can't tell you precisely whether or not eternal magic is losing its community. Some zones have a heavy eternal presence, others do not. Legacy isn't dying, we have had an increase in non-wizards tournaments in Europe and Asia this year, both in number of tournaments and in attendance.  If your community is losing its members, it might be a localized thing, but try finding somewhere else to play, perhaps there is another store within a reasonable distance that holds tournaments?  Anyway, a few more evidence: The fastest constructed tournament to sell out of all times in magic was GP Kyoto earlier this year, and legacy was the format. Not only that but the largest constructed tournament in the past year was a legacy tournament, GP NJ at around 4000 people. There's been several 500ish player legacy tournaments as well already this year. If legacy is dying, it is not happening everywhere."

Cause wizards just increased the number of GPs per year from 2 to 3 and we hadn't had just 1 GP per year since 2009. We've always had more since.

There was rarely any new players coming in, so games were very hard to find, the format was super intimidating both price and rules wise to new players, and WoTC came as close to killing it as they could by having so few GP's for it.  It was easy to see that Modern was where all the excitement was, huge explosion of new players, supported by WoTC through promos, reprints, and Modern Masters, much lower barrier to entry, and a lot more tournament support. It also happened to be where all the card prices were going up the fastest, so a lot of the Legacy crowd sold their stuff to buy into it and ride the price appreciation train. It was getting harder and harder to sell/trade Legacy cards due to the diminishing playerbase, whereas Modern cards always were flying out of trade binders   Just my observations on my local scene"

Pauper is almost never played in paper from my experience. Trying to start a pauper group can also be difficult as people who have no clue about the format tend to scare others off.
