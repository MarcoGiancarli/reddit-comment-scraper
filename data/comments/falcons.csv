falcons,3e4hoz,MESQUITE_BBQ_JONES,-5,Tue Jul 21 22:48:54 2015 UTC,This is a PSL
falcons,3e4hoz,stoopkid99,7,Tue Jul 21 23:34:49 2015 UTC,I googled it... Pumpkin spice latte and Premier Soccer League and Pakistani Super League didn't seem like contenders.
falcons,3e4hoz,MESQUITE_BBQ_JONES,3,Tue Jul 21 23:36:36 2015 UTC,"Its a personal seating license. In the new stadium you have to purchase one of these in order to buy season tickets to the falcons game. Depending on how the good the seat (your PSL) is you get first right or refusal to any event at that stadium (meaning if you want to buy the tickets to Bieber, monster trucks, Superbowls, etc. you get to buy them). The nicest PSLs get their seats for these events if they want them. The next tier gets guaranteed tickets to any event, but not their seats just somewhere in the stadium. The next tier gets any tickets to any event excluding the Superbowl and SEC Championship (same deal their just a seat in the stadium not your seats). Then their are some that are just for falcons games. These are just the rules for the Falcons new stadium. I am sure Dallas and San Fran had different rules for selling their PSLs for their new stadiums. I assume the funds are used towards financing the project.  tl;dr I had to buy a seat in the new stadium before I could buy seasons tickets..."

Used to be at the 50 but I bet they switch it to splitting it in the endzones since it looks like one endzone has way more seats and probably a noise advantage."

To get 93 more wins at the current winning percentage, thats 9.97 more full seasons (16 x 0.583 = 9.3 wins per season) with no injuries. Thats a career of 17 seasons. For comparison, Peyton Manning just completed his 17th season (counting injured season) and Brady his 15th."
falcons,3e3egr,wbarker11,2,Tue Jul 21 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"True. It would take a lot for him to reach the top. Was more speaking in terms of just getting on the list. That's definitely do-able.   If the defense improves under Quinn, don't see why we can't be a consistent 10+ win team. Although Ryan over the course of his career will have played a tougher division. AFC South and AFC East have been weak throughout Manning and Brady's tenure's in each."

We'll need to make the playoffs a couple of times and get some wins to compensate for unavoidable bad years.   Edit: Just realized Manning won't gain more wins because he already switched teams, so we might get away with 8 wins per season if Matty plays 10 more seasons."

Matty already has a couple of losing seasons under his belt, which means he needs a ton of winning ones in a row. The problem is it takes the rest of the team to be just as good. While I think Matt can do it, too much depends on the FO and coaching staff being Belichick-esque in picking/coaching up talent."

There are many die hard CFB fans that can't stand the NFL, so they're out there.  Considering the NFL and CFB are 1 and 2 respectively for the most popular sport in the US, but you see more college merchandise around, I'd have to say the majority of CFB fans watch on Saturday, and also watch the NFL on Sunday.

falcons,3e00s9,Wayyside,-2,Mon Jul 20 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"well, this is simply not true. selling your PSA is very similar to selling stock on the stock market. You want to sell when there are buyers, not when the shit just hit the fan for your team, much like what is happening right now with SF. The Seahawks PSLs are selling for almost 8grand more than they were bought for right now."
falcons,3e00s9,Benjammin172,4,Tue Jul 21 11:37:42 2015 UTC,"PSLs shouldn't be considered an investment at all. The Seahawks are the exception, not the rule. They started issuing PSLs 14 years ago, and the most expensive CSLs (Seattle calls them CSLs instead of PSLs) cost $3,000 at the time. PSL owners used to be able to make a decent chunk of change on their ""investment"", because PSLs USED to be relatively affordable. But since then, owners have jacked up the prices by quite a bit. You'll be hard pressed to find anyone who purchased new PSLs in the last few years that isn't losing money on them when they decide to sell. Just ask Cowboys and Jets fans how the value of their PSLs have held up in the last few years. They're losing thousands of bucks on each one when it comes time to sell."

Like I said, PSLs USED to be affordable. Now they're ridiculously expensive and they aren't worthwhile investments anymore. And if fans from the biggest fanbase in the league are losing money on PSLs, then what do you expect to happen to the value of ours in a few years?"
falcons,3e00s9,Wayyside,-2,Tue Jul 21 14:02:27 2015 UTC,"if fans from the biggest fanbase in the league are losing money on PSLs, then what do you expect to happen to the value of ours in a few years?   the bigger the fanbase, the higher the initial cost of the PSL will be because there are more people willing to buy them, this is simple supply and demand. The PSLs for our stadium will not be sold for less than purchased, i guarantee you. That source takes things out of context   PSLs USED to be affordable    ??? Dallas's club level PSL was $150,000, whereas the falcons is only $45,000. The falcons PSLs are cheaper than Dallas's on EVERY price point.   Atlanta has VERY fair pricing. Even better than the Jets."
falcons,3e00s9,Benjammin172,4,Tue Jul 21 14:15:10 2015 UTC,"Your turn to provide ANY sources for any of the things that you're stating as fact.   And yes, PSLs USED to be affordable when they were originally being offered. Look at how much the Steelers and Seahawks used to charge for a PSL back in 2001 and 2002 when they were originally being offered. Now look at how expensive a PSL is for newer stadiums like the Falcons or Cowboys have built. It's not exactly a surprise that the Steelers and Seahawks PSL values have increased exponentially, they were dirt cheap. The Cowboys and Falcons PSLs are not, and thus they won't increase in value the same way that earlier adopters' did.   The PSLs for the biggest fanbase in the league are selling for less now than they were when they were originally offered just a few years ago. And somehow you think that PSLs for a team that isn't even in the top half of the popularity rankings will increase in value?   Take a look at what I actually wrote in my posts. I never argued that Falcons PSL prices weren't fair, I just said that they aren't a good investment. They're obviously in line with the marketplace, but the secondary market has decided that they aren't worth it at the current price point. If you're buying the PSL because you're a fan that wants to see the games in the new stadium, then by all means go for it. Just don't expect to turn a profit if you try to sell the PSL, they simply aren't a good investment long term."

falcons,3dt7q4,pleasehelpplz,7,Sun Jul 19 05:43:17 2015 UTC,"Devonta is going to being given the best chance to be the starter in camp. Coleman is riskier in fantasy but he presents higher upside which is why you find him ranked mid 20's on most boards. Freeman is lumped in with guys like Doug Martin/Chris Ivory/Darren McFadden, guys that can be be starters but could be beaten out. If you're in the mid rounds in a 10 team league, take the high upside guy in Tevin because at that point in the draft, players will be dropped during the season so take the riskier play that could pan out. If you're in a deep league with like 12/14 teams, Freeman is a solid pick because he could the starter, but he'll still get plenty of carries even as a backup."
falcons,3dt7q4,ATL_GritzBlitz,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:06:55 2015 UTC,"Very well stated. Freeman will start the season as the guy with the most touches in the committee, but the general feeling is  Coleman will eventually win a majority of the touches, possibly early. I'd be okay with taking either. But in PPR leagues, Freeman will have the most upside as the pass catcher out of the backfield. Could get between 65+ catches this season."
falcons,3dt7q4,DevotedCypress,3,Sun Jul 19 20:33:45 2015 UTC,"Until further notice, I wouldn't use falcons backs, but yes I do think Tevin will get the lions share."
falcons,3dt7q4,__Mac__,2,Sun Jul 19 10:39:05 2015 UTC,idk...fantasy drafts are alot about value in later rounds. With the new ZBS adopted from shannahan we could actually have a run game this year.
falcons,3dt7q4,BurningTrees,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:34 2015 UTC,I was about to say the samething. The new offensive scheme will do wonders for our offense and defense. Fantasy wise I would go with Freeman before Coleman because I think he will be the starter all year and probably goal line touches. Keep an eye of Antone Smith!

falcons,3dhyfd,d1dOnly,10,Tue Jul 21 15:27:32 2015 UTC,"As a heads up, you're actually coming to Atlanta on one of the busiest weekends of the year. Aside from the Falcons 4th Preseason game on the 3rd, you also have:   Chick-Fil-A Kickoff Game - 9/5/2015 Dragon Con - 9/4/2015-9/7/2015 Dragon Con Parade - 9/5/2015   Previously, there was also a NASCAR race and the Braves seem to be in town every other year. Of the 3 main events this year, the Falcons 4th playoff game will be by far the lowest draw. The Chick-Fil-A Kick-Off Game will probably draw 65,000-67,000 people.  Dragon Con last year went over 65,000 people, and this year the expectation is to be close to 70,000. The Parade on Saturday (starts at 10:00 AM) last year drew over 75,000 people to watch, and this year if the weather is good might break 80,000.  Outside of these events, I'd suggest the Aquarium, World of Coke, Atlanta Zoo (a bit of a drive), and Stone Mountain (even more of a drive, but the laser show is worth it)."

The aquarium is great though so if you don't have time for both I'd definitely choose the aquarium.  Also the college football hall of fame is here in Atlanta.  I haven't been yet but some of my friends went and said it was a lot of fun.  Stone mountain is also a cool spot but it isn't downtown so it may be tough to get over there.  Unfortunately, my favorite southern food place, Carver's country kitchen, closed down.  Mary Mac's Tea Room is still going strong though and would be a good spot for some southern cooking. Although it isn't soul food, I'd also recommend checking out the Vortex.  They have awesome burgers and a great atmosphere.  The fact that dragon con is going on will be kind of fun as there will be all sorts of people wandering around downtown in crazy cosplay outfits.  If you like any comic book type stuff or just like people watching you should head down to wherever it is being hosted and just take it all in.  You don't need a ticket unless you want to go into the actual talks and there will be a cosplay parade Saturday morning at 10."

One of those has to be elite (or playing like their elite). And then you need a decent running game. Doesn't have to be great, just competent.   As far as skill position, yea you need a solid receiving corps. Most of these teams had one. I believe that's more vital than an elite receiver, you can stop one guy. So, I don't believe you need an elite WR. It's more of a luxury. Some of these teams had elite (ish) receivers though, but what I was illustrating was they weren't being paid like elite wide receivers.   One thing I'm most certain teams need though: Players on cheap/rookie deals. I'm pretty sure you can go through all of these teams and find 4-5 players key contributors outperforming their contracts by a wide margin either because of rookie deals or being a cheap free agent that hit their stride with a new team."

A good defense can bring you a long way, and I really hope Quinn can bring a difference to that, in due time with the pieces we have now and which we will acquire in the future. But we need more offense than just the QB. Other teams built their team up in a different way, but Brady would be a lot worse without Gronk and we would be a lot worse without Julio. For instance. I hope we can spare all the cap space we can, but I'm all for paying Julio."

I'm fine paying similar to what DT and Dez got, but a megatron type deal is just dumb regardless of how good the WR is. You need a good defense and good QB to win in this league. A great WR is just a luxury."
falcons,3deyue,xcbum89,15,Thu Jul 16 15:00:08 2015 UTC,"Can we just match the Dez/DT deal, put a mill on it to make Julio feel good, and get this done right now?"
falcons,3deyue,babooyagoo,5,Wed Jul 15 19:58:16 2015 UTC,Exactly.  Front load 3 of those extra million this year and be done with it.
falcons,3deyue,asha1985,9,Wed Jul 15 20:11:21 2015 UTC,"My thoughts for Julio's deal now are something like this:   5 years, $70.5M, $45.5M Guaranteed. Base Salary year 1 will be the highest of any season, trying to front load the contract as much as possible."
falcons,3deyue,d1dOnly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:42:19 2015 UTC,"Cap is only going up too, so I'm fine giving him in the $14-16m range."
falcons,3deyue,Spitfire221,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:22 2015 UTC,"We have plenty of spaces to fill. I'm all for paying Julio but the more space we save, the better."
falcons,3deyue,Steffnov,6,Wed Jul 15 20:15:54 2015 UTC,"This is good for us in terms of resigning Julio, set the market at a more reasonable value now (unlike Megatrons unreasonable value) . If we can sign him this off season to basically the exact deal Dez has, we should do it. I believe we have some cap space now, so if we can use that to front load the deal a bit it would be great."
falcons,3deyue,brownrd2,2,Wed Jul 15 19:20:11 2015 UTC,Yep this has reset the market on Wrs. There should be nothing that stops us from resigning Julio now.   This can help is in free agency from now on as Julio won't kill us like the Megatron type deal.
falcons,3deyue,GallionM,3,Wed Jul 15 19:22:45 2015 UTC,Loving this so much. Couldn't have played out any better.
falcons,3deyue,Steffnov,2,Wed Jul 15 19:49:00 2015 UTC,"Things can change in a year, especially in sports. We don't know where any player or team will be next season. That said, I expect Julio to aim for a similar contract Dez & DT would get this season, in which case I am very happy this isn't a Megatron-level contract.  Edit: And look at that, DT signed nearly the same deal, just with $1.5m less guaranteed."
falcons,3deyue,Hedgey,2,Wed Jul 15 19:29:53 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised to see a deal get done before camp is over as the Falcons usually shoot to get that done.  I'm very hopeful now.  Also, good luck DT getting Megatron money now...  EDIT: As soon as I said something about DT he gets nearly the same deal...WOW."
falcons,3deyue,bwyennicks,2,Wed Jul 15 19:38:29 2015 UTC,"So how much could they give him for the 2015 season in addition to the 10mil he's already getting? I know they like to leave around 5mil leftover in case of emergencies and for carryover, but they should definitely give him as much as they can right now before Tru needs a new contract and for some good FAs in the next few years (I predict some good OL signings next year)."
falcons,3deyue,Capn_Barboza,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:35 2015 UTC,But that's because dez and dt are second tier... Julio for that 20 mil a year!  /sarcasm

falcons,3dfkk5,drosa1991,4,Wed Jul 15 21:47:44 2015 UTC,Kendricks is one of the better Ilb in the game.   He would be an upgrade.   Maybe worth a 3rd or 4th imo.
falcons,3dfkk5,Jon_Snows_Dad,3,Wed Jul 15 23:32:26 2015 UTC,"Yes. Huge upgrade. But would never offer more than a Forth. While I love Paul and think hes great, Kendricks is better and still improving. That would also give us better LB depth, which is still pretty bad. Kendricks could replace Durant if an injury were to occur too and then start Paul."
falcons,3dfkk5,Hot_Lanta,3,Thu Jul 16 03:05:21 2015 UTC,Would definitely be a major upgrade for us as our LB corps is still relatively a weak group.

falcons,3da6ms,everest53,10,Tue Jul 14 18:44:32 2015 UTC,I'm just going to play devils advocate because I have the flair for it.  Besides Trufant and Moore who else could start on other teams?
falcons,3da6ms,flordeliest,13,Wed Jul 15 00:20:13 2015 UTC,"Kemal Ishmael was pretty solid last year and could definitely start for another team. Dwight Lowery is projected to start for the Colts this year (not looking at last year's personnel, but he was part of the defense last year that they're using as criteria)."
falcons,3da6ms,flordeliest,-4,Wed Jul 15 00:54:51 2015 UTC,How are you going to use BR as a source to support your case against BR?
falcons,3da6ms,flordeliest,7,Wed Jul 15 01:06:33 2015 UTC,You asked who else could start for other teams. I gave you an answer. Who said I'm making a case against BR?
falcons,3da6ms,Benjammin172,-3,Wed Jul 15 02:32:41 2015 UTC,Well the reason I asked the question was for someone to explain why BR is wrong abut your secondary.  Using BR to support the case sort of defeats the purpose. We started with BR having a low opinion of the Falcons' secondary.
falcons,3da6ms,pfmac,2,Wed Jul 15 02:42:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I get the premise. Just answering your direct question to disprove the idea that we are starting 'non-starter' talent across the board.  But to address the other question, I'm not sure they are way off, but the secondary is the scapegoat here for a bad pass rush. You can't judge a secondary just by how many passing yards the team gives up. For instance, the passer rating of opposing QBs was middle of the pack (15th) and our TDs given up were 5th fewest. But when you're 30th in sacks, there's going to be some give somewhere."
falcons,3da6ms,vogel_t,13,Wed Jul 15 16:48:06 2015 UTC,"Dumb article. Not because we're rated so low, obviously we don't deserve a ton of credit after how awful our defense was last year. But you can't look at the secondary in a vacuum when our D line gave opposing QBs 6 seconds to throw every time they touched the ball. There isn't a secondary in the NFL, Seattle's included, that can cover receivers for as long as our secondary was asked to. Ironically, our secondary is probably the most talented unit overall on our defense. I could easily see them jump into the top 15 or even the top 10 this year if our pass rush is just average."
falcons,3da6ms,RavinDaveR,5,Tue Jul 14 19:22:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. People keep forgetting that we had the worst defense of the league and that the secondary was carrying the workload of 2 units at the same time, every damn game. Some guys like Tru, Ish had to do endure that crap all year and STILL made plays. They should get praised for that, but no, it's easier to say that it's all their fault as well."
falcons,3da6ms,lukasbradley,2,Tue Jul 14 21:24:47 2015 UTC,And our LBs were consistently bad in their coverage as well.

The fact that this article fails to address the most obvious reason (pass rush) our secondary gave up so many yards through the air last season just proves it was written by someone who probably justifies his conclusions based on what the stat-sheets say.
falcons,3da6ms,oxygencube,6,Tue Jul 14 18:43:08 2015 UTC,"22-26 is the range they should be in. Desmond Trufant is developing into one of the best. Collins and Southward provide promise.

falcons,3da6ms,Supertilt,3,Thu Jul 16 00:19:46 2015 UTC,"This may be the minority, but I tend to agree. It's rating the DEPTH CHART as a whole. Trufant is finally getting credit this offseason and could go ""elite"" this season, but besides that, who else is noteworthy? Moore is Pro Bowl caliber when he is healthy. I love Willy Mo, but the guy can't stay on the field long enough in a season to make a significant impact. Besides those two, literally no one else is proven. Alford and Collins have potential, but that's all that is right now. Alford had a terrible year last year. And Ricardo spent last year on the practice roster, is making a switch to FS, and still has never played a snap in an NFL regular season game. And to top it off, behind all of these starters, it is bleak. I'd say besides Trufant, the rest of the depth chart is below average. Bleacher Report is hit or miss, but they may have this one right Falcons fam. Sorry."

Our team isn't centered around Julio. It starts and stops with Matt Ryan. If he has a good run game and time to throw, all he needs is pro caliber receivers. Not world beaters."
falcons,3d6l7f,reddier5,25,Mon Jul 13 23:24:36 2015 UTC,Replacing him with younger talent    You act like that is so easy. You don't simply replace an all-pro receiver in his prime with younger talent.
falcons,3d6l7f,Metalbound,14,Tue Jul 14 01:26:58 2015 UTC,He is a top 5 receiver in the entire NFL. You do not get many chances at that. He has a lot of good years in him and we would be stupid to not pay him what he deserves.
falcons,3d6l7f,oballistikz,27,Tue Jul 14 00:51:59 2015 UTC,Jesus fuck he's not injury prone.   2011 he had a cut on his hand   2012 he was fine  2013 he reinjured a foot he didn't allow to heal  2014 knee to oblique causing a bruise  I see one injury that happened more than once.

falcons,3d6l7f,oballistikz,0,Tue Jul 14 15:42:43 2015 UTC,I heard it from talking to one of the writers. Idk how much you believe them but that's what they said. They said when he got the surgery he didn't allow the screw and bone to set and heal properly. The injury risk was there because of that. That's why 2013 happened.

falcons,3d6l7f,pawnedhinges,18,Tue Jul 14 02:23:31 2015 UTC,Matt Ryan is one of the best deep ball qbs and Julio is one of the best deep ball wrs. I don't see how there's even a discussion about his contract. I'd be extremely upset with the organization to lose a player with that skill level
falcons,3d6l7f,GallionM,6,Tue Jul 14 00:14:57 2015 UTC,"I'd keep him. You draft to find players like Julio who can take over a game. It'd be a nice chunk of cap tied up between him and Matt but I think that we'd be able to handle it. I just took a look at the NFLPA salary cap report and we're sitting on a little over 16 mill combined with Julio's option we'd have around 26 million so we could give him 22 million this year to knock the cap figures down for the next few years. I doubt that we'd lock him in for 7 years like Detroit did Megatron (not even sure if teams do that anymore) but if we did it'd definitely pay off in the long run. Guys like OBJ, Antonio Brown, etc in the future are going to set the bar even higher so you want to get it out of the way as soon as possible. All it takes is one mediocre to average player getting a mega deal at a position (Jay Cutler at QB for example) and the rest of the league will be forced to negotiate from that point."
falcons,3d6l7f,StraightToYourDome,2,Mon Jul 13 23:00:06 2015 UTC,THIS.   Front load the shit out of this contract.
falcons,3d6l7f,Almost_Capable,0,Thu Jul 16 12:35:40 2015 UTC,That's the only way I think it could work. We'd have to front load it and guarantee a good bit. That way while we are still not Super Bowl caliber we can pay most of it. Then in two or three years have it down to 10 a year
falcons,3d6l7f,Almost_Capable,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:50 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the newest cba made it so the yearly amounts can only differ by so much. But I do agree frontload as much as possible.

falcons,3d6l7f,brownrd2,5,Mon Jul 13 22:53:18 2015 UTC,"Well obviously if you sign before Dez and DT you will save more money, do you think Julio's agent doesn't know that? No negotiations right now most likely means that it's Julio's end that isn't entertaining contract discussions.  Julio has tons of leverage and can wait on a contract longer that Dez or DT, Julio will cost more than those two, no way around it."
falcons,3d6l7f,Almost_Capable,2,Mon Jul 13 23:05:16 2015 UTC,"I doubt he costs more. I would be surprised if he didn't get an almost identical deal to whatever Dez ends up pulling in. They're about on the same level in terms of impact on the team, and the market isn't going to change much between this year and next. however, what Dez is going to get will still be higher than Julio would get now since Dallas has a lot more pressure to sign...Just based on skill and impact on their respective teams, I would be very surprised if Julio got more than Dez, I doubt he even asks for it. I obviously have no inside info so this is just my speculation."
falcons,3d6l7f,Drew__Brees,2,Mon Jul 13 23:57:46 2015 UTC,"I assumed the same that it is Julio's side halting negotiations. However I disagree that we have no leverage. Julio has had injury issues and he may go into two years without a long term contract, being this year and a potential franchise tag afterwards."
falcons,3d6l7f,-500-,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:34:03 2015 UTC,I think Julio is betting on himself to have another monster year next year so that he HAS to be paid 16+ a year.
falcons,3d6l7f,tiercel,8,Tue Jul 14 02:54:40 2015 UTC,"You fucking pay him and you fucking pay him now, dammit."
falcons,3d6l7f,everest53,5,Tue Jul 14 05:02:42 2015 UTC,"He's worth more than that, but the salary cap limits what we can pay him. Considering the money he helps bring in by being our flashiest player, and that he will sell seats in a new stadium, any number is a bargain.  What a player is worth, and what they get paid, is often worlds apart. Some get overpaid, some underpaid. The trick is to give them a number that they can live with (not that makes them happy) and that we can tolerate."
falcons,3d6l7f,brownrd2,2,Tue Jul 14 01:06:37 2015 UTC,"The cap is projecting to go up more and more each year. Lock him up now to a large deal now, won't seem as large 3 years from now."
falcons,3d6l7f,Benjammin172,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:24:50 2015 UTC,"The market for receivers is 'hot' right now, teams are spending a lot on their receivers. If you're only happy with 10mil, you can expect only players who would be considered solid WR2s, but not really any sort of game changer (similar to Cobb). If you want a bonafide WR1, you're paying more than 10mil...That's just the way the market for WRs is right now, you can thank Calvin Johnson for that."
falcons,3d6l7f,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:09:25 2015 UTC,"Is he worth it? Definitely, he's a top 5 NFL receiver. Should we be the ones to pay him? Probably. He's too good to let go, especially given everything that we gave up for him. But if we don't win a Super Bowl with him on the roster, then trading up for him will probably go down as the second biggest mistake that our front office has made just behind trading Favre away."
falcons,3d6l7f,Daxxtoon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:12:49 2015 UTC,"That's a lot. With the lack of proven talent on the defense, 16 might be too much. 14 would be probably be where I'd stop. He's an elite receiver and a great fit."
falcons,3d6l7f,bwyennicks,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"With the way the cap is going, the team should sign Julio to that if they have to but they are probably waiting to see what happens with D. Thomas and Dez before beginning their negotiations with Julio."

falcons,3d6l7f,hecrey,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:43:11 2015 UTC,"Julio would want $16 if he signs this summer.  After Dez and DT get deals, we're going to have to pay Julio $18.  The Bengals are going to be stuck doing the same with AJ.  $18 million for a wideout is awfully expensive.  You're approaching franchise QB numbers."

falcons,3d6l7f,MrBigDJohnson,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:34:48 2015 UTC,You keep him no matter what he asks. At the end of the day Julio Jones is one of the best WRs in the league. He forces the other team to gameplan around him before they do anything else.
falcons,3d6l7f,draculapresley,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:23:48 2015 UTC,"Yes he's worth the money. Ryan and Julio have great chemistry, you can't just replace that. Julio is a top five WR, a stand up guy (nothing like greedy Dez), and getting paid!"
falcons,3d6l7f,StraightToYourDome,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:50:30 2015 UTC,"I think realistically we give Julio 12-13 a year and everyone is happy. He should command serious money. Not only is he a top WR and has insane chemistry with Ryan, he also is a seat filler and a face of the franchise. This is a guy you pay his entire career to keep him a Falcon."
falcons,3d6l7f,wannaknowmyname,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"Market salary for him is below CJ and at or just above DB.   14-15 a year, front loaded. Completely fair.  He will never wear another jersey, just like Roddy."
falcons,3d6l7f,brokerrobtampa,0,Thu Jul 16 12:41:08 2015 UTC,He's not going to get 16 but 10 isn't enough. The cap goes up every single year so 10 mil is a smaller and smaller chunk of change. For a top 3 WR in the NFL 10 mil wouldn't be close to what he's worth to any NFL team

I proceed to bang my head against the wall as Justin Houston and Hali drop into coverage while Mike Devito and whoever the hell the other fat end is rush the edge.   I mean please NFL, Madden, whoever. Can we please just start listing defensive lineman as edge or interior and then listing LBs as off LOS or on LOS.

falcons,3ct5kh,DevotedCypress,4,Fri Jul 10 16:16:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't think making great catches signifies poor route running. His footwork is killer (so many of his catches in between the hash marks had an immediate change of direction as the result of hard plant). I mean, look at the catch against Cincinnati. He couldn't create separation on the slant (the DB was interfering pretty much), but has the feel to rework and curl out to the sideline...instinctual route running if you ask me. If you don't have the physical tools to blow by or outjump defenders, you have to make your catches with savvy and perfect routes...two attributes I think Hardy has for sure."
falcons,3ct5kh,MH136,3,Fri Jul 10 17:35:53 2015 UTC,"100% agreed. Without the physical tools, you don't become the NCAA's all-time receptions leader without polished route running, consistent hands, and a natural instinct being a WR."
falcons,3ct5kh,DevotedCypress,5,Fri Jul 10 18:00:30 2015 UTC,"What exactly made you think he is weak route runner?   My assessment is he is a great route runner, he had separation the vast majority of the time and slowed in the holes of the defense often. He was covered on his fly routes a few times, but those are the easiest to defend.   He really reminds me of a less feisty Steve Smith."
falcons,3ct5kh,GarnetandBlack,2,Fri Jul 10 18:01:35 2015 UTC,GLUE HANDS. That move at 2:11 was pretty sick. Nice find.
falcons,3ct5kh,Wayyside,2,Fri Jul 10 17:07:08 2015 UTC,Looked to me like he had his man beat on just about every play.
falcons,3ct5kh,nevermindmenow3,2,Fri Jul 10 17:21:21 2015 UTC,It's way to early to tell but he reminds me of Antonio Brown. All the way down to their similar physical measurables and the fact that they both played some QB in HS. I've been watching his games since news is slow and he's been really impressive.
falcons,3ct5kh,GallionM,2,Fri Jul 10 18:07:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen their combine measurables, but their physical statures are definitely the very similar. Smaller, quick but not fast, great hands, polished route runners. That's a good comparison. Can you imagine a combination of Julio and a Brown-esque player....scary."

falcons,3csgok,Benjammin172,2,Fri Jul 10 12:57:56 2015 UTC,I sat almost exactly where you are looking last year for the Saints opener. Was pretty happy with it. Was a healthy mix of fans up there. Fun watching all the poopfaces walk out after the Colston fumble.
falcons,3csgok,Benjammin172,2,Fri Jul 10 17:39:38 2015 UTC,"There really aren't too many bad seats in the Dome. Even in the upper deck you'll have a great view. And unfortunately for us, the Dome is probably one of the most away team friendly stadiums in the NFL. I'm not sure that this will be the case for the Texans since they're a newer franchise, but it's not unusual for the Dome to get just as loud for the away team as it gets for the Falcons."
falcons,3csgok,gsfgf,2,Fri Jul 10 12:33:44 2015 UTC,Thanks for your input! I think I found some good seats in sec 347. I saw a view on seatgeeks.com and it seems like I will be ok.   I will be the black sheep with my family as I will be the only one rooting for the Texans but I am excited nonetheless. I have been  overseas pushing 6 years and I am finally getting the oppurtunity to go see family stateside. I couldnt imagine a better game I would rather see! I am a little bummed that Jamal Anderson wont be there to do the dirty bird!  Edit: Spelling

Hopefully it will be a great game (with the Falcons winning of course). We typically have a pretty decent sized tailgate for the first home game, but I think we'll be doing it for the Texans game this year since the home opener against the Eagles is on Monday night. Feel free to hit me up closer to time if you guys want to stop by, and I'm sure a lot of the guys here will do the same."

He was sitting right there in the perfect spot. I believe the 4th round was too high, but fully expected the Falcons to pounce in the 5th if given the option.

Dez and DTs agents all think the same thing. All three are waiting to see what happens. Julios agent can wait the longest to because the falcons can use the Franchise tag."
falcons,3cilsw,Hot_Lanta,4,Wed Jul 8 05:11:33 2015 UTC,"Same thing for AJ Green, all 4 are in a wait and see approach. The question is ""Will anyone blink, and who will it be""."
falcons,3cilsw,d1dOnly,3,Wed Jul 8 14:24:14 2015 UTC,Ahh yes. Aj green. Totally forgot about him. His agent probably wants to wait a year so his stock goes back up again. The injury probably dropped it a bit (just a tiny bit).   Its a massive game of chicken.
falcons,3cilsw,Hot_Lanta,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:45:17 2015 UTC,The franchise tag isn't the desired outcome for Julio's agent. His agenda is a long term deal.
falcons,3cilsw,flordeliest,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:15:47 2015 UTC,"No. But his goal is to get Julio the most money he can. And if that means one year of a 12+ million dollar franchise tag, he'll do it. Dez and DT will likely get deals next year, and that sets the stage for Julio to make more than them"
falcons,3cilsw,Hot_Lanta,2,Thu Jul 9 15:12:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with the franchise tag for most players is there is no stability. What if something happened that comprised Julio's ability to play?   Yeah he would have 12 mil but if he signed a long term deal he would have as much as 50 mil guaranteed that he got as soon as he signed the contract.   Now tell me which is more desirable?   Also IMO Julio could command a contract in free agency that averaged more per year than the franchise tag, so the tag is way less desirable in his case."
falcons,3cilsw,flordeliest,4,Thu Jul 9 19:32:43 2015 UTC,"Let's face it. We're going to end up paying him the highest receiver deal this year, and deservedly so. He almost single handedly caused Matty Ice be the best deep ball thrower. On top of that, he's a freak athlete that you don't let go in free agency. He's going to cost us as much or more as both Thomas and Bryant sign for. I'm all for this. You don't let a player like Julio walk and he deserves the contract. Would love an injury clause..."
falcons,3cilsw,haughtyjimi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 08:46:32 2015 UTC,"I feel like it won't be too big of a contract. I remember a recent interview when Julio said he just ""wants to win"". Wouldn't be surprised if we see that manifest as a middle-to-high salary as opposed to top money."
falcons,3cilsw,pdeluc99,9,Wed Jul 8 12:26:55 2015 UTC,"Zero percent chance that he takes a pay cut because he ""wants to win"". He has one real shot at a blockbuster contract, and this is it."
falcons,3cilsw,Benjammin172,4,Wed Jul 8 15:02:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah no. Professional athletes usually only get one big contract in their lives for all of the shit they put their body through, they better go for all the money they can get. If I am Julio, give me Calvin money. Of course as a fan I want him to take a lesser deal for the better of the team but I hold nothing against a player trying to get the most money he can"
falcons,3cilsw,CDub22EP,2,Wed Jul 8 16:00:12 2015 UTC,That's what he's supposed to say. It's naive to think he'd leave money on the table. Not to mention stupid on his part.
falcons,3cilsw,jculv,8,Wed Jul 8 12:36:54 2015 UTC,I'm probably speaking out my ass and has nothing to do with it. I think TD doesn't want another Baker incident. He's learned not to give out contracts to injury prone players coming off their best year. Julio wants CJ $ but the FO are concerned with his foot.
falcons,3cilsw,MetaWorldPanda,2,Wed Jul 8 10:39:54 2015 UTC,His foot wasn't an issue last year. The issue was julio took a knee to the oblique and strained it.
falcons,3cilsw,oballistikz,5,Wed Jul 8 17:59:37 2015 UTC,The screw in his foot is the issue.
falcons,3cilsw,MetaWorldPanda,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:49:12 2015 UTC,How is it an issue if it never comes up again? Is Brady's previous season ending injury and issue?  What about Adrian Peterson's?  Lets not pretend like Julio is some walking time bomb
falcons,3cilsw,oballistikz,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"Are you sure it won't ever come up again? Those guys injuries were freak accidents, Julio has a screw in his foot that can break at anytime.  We were told that his foot was 100% healed and wouldn't be an issue after the first surgery."
falcons,3cilsw,MetaWorldPanda,3,Thu Jul 9 00:11:42 2015 UTC,Julio's was a freak accident. And his injury never healed because of the combine. It did this time.
falcons,3cilsw,oballistikz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:16:23 2015 UTC,I'm talking about the surgery after 2012. They inserted a titanium screw in his foot and it somehow broke in the Jets game in 2013.
falcons,3cilsw,MetaWorldPanda,4,Thu Jul 9 00:20:58 2015 UTC,"The screw was inserted before the nfl combine. He didn't let it heal. Come 2013 he shreds the screw, cause it didn't heal right.   This time he did the right thing."
falcons,3cilsw,oballistikz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:24:45 2015 UTC,You're right.
falcons,3cilsw,MetaWorldPanda,2,Thu Jul 9 00:31:10 2015 UTC,"My feeling is that Julio and his agent are taking a wait and see approach in reference to Dez and DT. Both are currently under the franchise tag, and if they don't make a deal by July 16th (I believe that's the date), then they cannot sign a new contract this year.  It's a smart play for Julio and his agent to wait and see what happens. If neither play gets a long term deal done, then they can work harder on what they believe the market value will be. If, however, one of those 2 gets a deal done first, then Julio's agent will have a base to make his counters and arguments from.  A deal was never going to get done early in the offseason, it was not going to be a smart move for Julio to do so. I have felt for a while now that Training Camp was the most likely time that a new deal got done, as the situations with the franchised players will be resolved (One way or another), and all parties will have a better idea of what the market is."

Revenue is not just ticket sales and merchandise, but money from network TV deals, licensing and a whole slew of other sources.  Therefore, the season to season revenue stream to each team is at least consistent enough for salaries and day to day activities.

The Falcons, Patriots, Seahawks, Jags, etc. all at the end of the year pool their profits, the NFL then takes a cut and splits the rest equally among the 32 teams so that unlike baseball, you can't buy a championship, everyone has an equal amount of money to work with and the same hard cap.  Also Trufant and Julio are still in their rookie deals, that's a lot of why we've had money to throw around."
falcons,3cjlb1,NewRedditorHere,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:47:36 2015 UTC,"Ryan is elite.  The only way you can know that, however, is if you watch the game.  It's easy to look at stats and our record and say ""there is literally no way that a QB can be elite and have his team go 6-10"".  But the leadership, confidence, and drive he shows on the field is right up there with the elite players.    Trufant has the potential to be elite with a serviceable pass rush.  He needs to tweak a few things, but if we had a pass rush right NOW, I'd consider him to be 85% close to being elite."
falcons,3cjlb1,wbarker11,0,Wed Jul 8 12:42:44 2015 UTC,"Ryan is elite.   It's debatable. As of right now I don't think he's a top five guy, but out of any QB in the league I think most fans will say he has the greatest chance to become an ""elite"" player based on talent alone.    Trufant has the potential to be elite with a serviceable pass rush. He needs to tweak a few things, but if we had a pass rush right NOW, I'd consider him to be 85% close to being elite.   110% agree, I just don't think it has that much to do with a lack of pass rush. He's a bit undersized - not exactly Alford in that sense but he has been exposed by larger receivers in the past. Unlike Alford, he has the ball and coverage skills to make up for it in most instances.  With some better help over the top from the safeties and the pass rush, as mentioned, I think he will be able solidify himself as a top five guy."
falcons,3cjlb1,jetlife_,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:39:22 2015 UTC,"For me, it's still the top four: Rodgers, Manning, Brady, Brees.  I think Rivers and Ryan are neck and neck.  Romo has always played sligggggghhhhhtttttllllllyyyyy under Ryan, but now that he had the league's best offensive line along with Dez AND Demarco he's all of a sudden elite?  Yeah, no, give him the supporting cast Matt has had the past 2 years, and he wouldn't have the same stats.    Don't even get me started about Roethlisberger.  He's the most fucking hyped quarterback right now.  The dude has a top 5 running back AND WR.  The dude's been REALLY good for a while, but he's nowhere fucking near elite.  AB = Julio production-wise, so give Matt Ryan a L'aveon Bell and he'd be putting up elite numbers."
falcons,3cjlb1,jaecup,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:47:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe in this context, its easier to think about it this way...not are those players top 5 players...but will they get paid like top 5 players?

falcons,3cf98a,circaATL,9,Tue Jul 7 17:12:43 2015 UTC,If they game him the 20/20 he'd be in the 6 spot and BR thinks that would hurt their credibility.

falcons,3cf98a,Bearded_Deity,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:37:46 2015 UTC,It's because he was like the 3rd best QB in the league for the final 6 games and made a AP-less Vikings competitive.
falcons,3cf98a,Bearded_Deity,7,Wed Jul 8 04:12:46 2015 UTC,"I think anyone with common sense, and eyes, could tell you this list is off.  Ryan has been a top 10 qb every year in the league. And top 5 the last 4 or so. Ryan behind Rivers? Don't make me laugh."
falcons,3cf98a,Steffnov,3,Tue Jul 7 17:16:50 2015 UTC,Well you've got to keep in mind we watch him every game. People that make these lists will see 3 or 4 performances/year
falcons,3cf98a,Bearded_Deity,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:48:15 2015 UTC,"This is definitely true. And a huge factor. But I dunno, I feel like even just looking at stats, from individual years, and as a career, you can't say Ryan is behind some of these guys. Even if you've never seen a game of his and only seen his stats.   Personally, I watch other teams and games too, and keep up with the ones that don't come on in my area as far as stats, who performed well, etc. Maybe that just gives me a more well rounded, objective view of the league (I'm not crazy enough to say Ryan is the best in the NFL). lol"

falcons,3cf98a,jetlife_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:34:49 2015 UTC,But who would you put him ahead of?
falcons,3cf98a,brownrd2,2,Tue Jul 7 14:50:25 2015 UTC,"Wilson, Brees (it's a toss up and I'm a homer), and Romo"
falcons,3cf98a,jetlife_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"I agree. He should absolutely be ahead of Wilson, and you could make a strong argument for ranking him ahead of Romo too. With the Cowboys O-line, Romo has almost three times as long to throw the ball. Combine that with a competent running game and an all-time great at tight end, and Romo definitely has it much easier than Ryan does."
falcons,3cf98a,caduceuz,4,Tue Jul 7 16:59:56 2015 UTC,Can't really argue with that...actually a pretty solid list.
falcons,3cf98a,Metalbound,5,Tue Jul 7 13:47:58 2015 UTC,I don't love Romo ahead of Matt but he had a good season last year so I'll let it slide
falcons,3cf98a,caduceuz,5,Tue Jul 7 13:51:37 2015 UTC,"I think based on last season success Romo deserves that spot over Ryan for now. Would I rather have Romo? Of course not, but I do think he deserves the recognition."
falcons,3cf98a,phamalacka,2,Tue Jul 7 13:57:49 2015 UTC,"He's definitely ahead of Ryan. I felt the same before I looked at their stats from over the past few years, but he clearly has had the edge."
falcons,3cf98a,YesWeCannabis32,2,Tue Jul 7 14:03:23 2015 UTC,"I hate to be that guy but this list is awful.  Bridgewater over Rivers? Carr over Kaepernick? Geno Smith at 47(He's below average, but not that bad)  Of course Matty Ice is a top 10 QB, but don't rely on this list."
falcons,3cf98a,Benjammin172,2,Tue Jul 7 20:58:10 2015 UTC,I'd put Carr over Kaepernick any day of the week.
falcons,3cf98a,cajungator3,2,Wed Jul 8 07:13:18 2015 UTC,The quarterback with one year of experience over one with multiple playoff wins. If you say so.

Ben and Romo are set to regress. I wouldn't be shocked if the list going into 2017 was Rodgers, Luck, Ryan, Wilson.   That being said, Eli and Rivers are way too low. Tannehill, too. Bridgewater and Palmer are laughably high."

We have Jarrett and Beasley to speak on his true character and to provide leadership to him. He is a project, but higher upside than basically anyone on our line. A 4th is nothing for a starting tackle in 2 years. I like his potential, and like our locker room. He's worth it imo"
falcons,3cgf8c,Hot_Lanta,6,Tue Jul 7 19:20:35 2015 UTC,You make compelling points.
falcons,3cgf8c,iRonin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:18:19 2015 UTC,Why thank you. I just feel we are the perfect landing spot for him. He would have his former teammates and a strong lockerroom.
falcons,3cgf8c,Hot_Lanta,10,Tue Jul 7 20:46:42 2015 UTC,"I think so, he's potentially a first round guy. The character issues would probably have dropped him a bit if he was eligible for another season but he'd still be a first round guy if he played well. I've seen reports saying that it'll likely take a 6th or 7th though. 4th may be our only shot to jump the Bucs and Redskins (providing they're above us in lottery order)."
falcons,3cgf8c,GallionM,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:56:07 2015 UTC,It's the same order as the 2015 draft.  If we want to jump them we have to grab him a round earlier than they'd be willing to go.  We don't have a 5th rounder to give up though.

falcons,3cgf8c,Benjammin172,3,Tue Jul 7 21:36:44 2015 UTC,"Maybe, I know that isn't a solid answer. He was projected as a 1st round pick next season and you always expect a 1st rounder to be a starter soon. So he might be a borderline starter. The fact is we have very little depth so he would have a real chance to start."
falcons,3cgf8c,iRonin,3,Wed Jul 8 00:23:11 2015 UTC,"We won't know if he was worth it for a few years, but IMO no. I wouldn't give up a 4th rounder on someone who just got kicked off his team, and who is very much an NFL project. Especially when we already lose our 5th rounder for next year. The red flags outweigh the potential upside for me, and we can get someone who is more NFL-ready next year without worrying if they're going to self destruct off the field."

Once we start getting pressure I bet he will get more recognition.
falcons,3ccwkn,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Tue Jul 7 12:14:04 2015 UTC,Yeah I remember one play he was hanging with Jordy Nelson for a while and I think it ended up being incomplete. It's difficult to stick with receivers when the pressure stalls.

falcons,3ccmtw,jetlife_,2,Tue Jul 7 00:59:01 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, they didn't. Alford was mediocre in all but one game this past season. McClain showed flashes, like he does every season, but failed to prove he can consistently cover the slot - i.e why Wilson took over mid-season.  Obviously our FO feels the same or they wouldn't have used a second round pick on a cornerback."
falcons,3ccmtw,iRonin,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:59:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can buy that. Just didn't think they'd be 3 or below on every other team's depth chart.

Seeing how the defensive backs shake out is probably the part of the depth chart I'm most interested in/anticipating."
falcons,3ccmtw,ATL_GritzBlitz,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:33:12 2015 UTC,"They obviously didn't want to pay McClain/Wilson and let them go, forcing us to draft a CB.   Well we certainly weren't forced to take a nickel-CB replacement in round two; we could have found a guy like that in the later rounds of the draft. It just so happens that Alford may be a solid fit at nickel, with Collins filling the hole on the outside as projected - killing two birds with one stone.  In that same thought, the departure of McClain and Wilson + Alford's poor play could have been direct causes of Southward's proposed transition to CB. They wouldn't be grooming the guy to become a backup, or a nickel (due to his skill set and size), so it's safe to assume they were preparing him to play on the outside. If things were to go as planned, he would be opposite Trufant for years to come with Alford sliding into the slot. Obviously the drafting of Collins is a curveball to that plan, but in the end it only makes us a deeper team.   Seeing how the defensive backs shake out is probably the part of the depth chart I'm most interested in/anticipating.   Definitely. I'm concerned about our safety situation, but there is no question we have a ton of raw talent in our backfield."

Mike Smith was great for us, the best coach we've had to date. But his second half management is extremely well documented. Just see the Browns/Lions games this year.  For that game in particular, we were up 24-14 at the half. That first half Ryan was 18-24, for 274 yards and 3 touchdowns. We then went vanilla with the gameplan in the second half and let off the gas. We scored zero points in that second half. SF made adjustments and came back firing."

Silly move by Smith? Of course, but in the end our defense (or lack of) is the reason we lost that game.   And the Lions game? Oh that time when our defense allowed them to drive from their own five yard line to our 30 yard line, without any timeouts and 1:40 on the clock?   I'm definitely not saying Smith didn't have a role in those loses, but our defense clearly shit the bed in those two instances. Whether that comes down to the talent-level or Nolan's playcalling, I don't know.   For that game in particular, we were up 24-14 at the half. That first half Ryan was 18-24, for 274 yards and 3 touchdowns. We then went vanilla with the gameplan in the second half and let off the gas. We scored zero points in that second half. SF made adjustments and came back firing.   Certainly not disagreeing with that, but I still think it's absolutely ridiculous to presume that Smith was the SOLE person that ""kept us back from the Superbowl"". I know Smitty is an easy scapegoat for you guys, but I think you're downplaying just how bad our guys on defense (and even offense) played during his coaching tenure.   Ryan really didn't play well in the third quarter. On our first drive in the second half, Ryan threw a pretty ugly INT. Later in the 3rd we were actually starting to get some momentum back after an Akers missed field goal. On the proceeding drive we got down to their 30 yard line before Ryan inexplicably fumbled a perfect snap. Again, two huge plays that had absolutely nothing to do with Smith - completely changed the momentum. We could have essentially put the game away on either of those drives.  Don't get me wrong, the 49ers defense definitely stepped up, but it's not as if they completely shut us down - we were still able to move the ball down the field pretty consistently. Our defense was destroyed by Vernon Davis in the second half primarily because we had to use a spy on Kapernick on nearly every play. It was a calculated risk that ultimately shut down Kap's legs, but exposed our undersized secondary and linebacker core."
falcons,3cb0w2,jetlife_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:08:03 2015 UTC,I mean we gave up 3 possession leads in both playoff games that year. And Smith has been horrible at making second half adjustments ever since that playoff game against Green Bay in 2010. His play calling was always super conservative whenever we had a lead going into halftime. See the Lions game last year. I don't even know how you could consider this a controversial opinion at this point.
falcons,3cb0w2,Benjammin172,-1,Mon Jul 6 15:48:15 2015 UTC,"I mean we gave up 3 possession leads in both playoff games that year.   Well that fell more on Matt Ryan's shoulders than Smiths' - he had two HUGE turnovers in the 3rd quarter of the SF game, on drives that could have essentially ended the game. His ""super conservative"" play calling was actually still effective in the second half, but of course turnovers negated a few of those drives.    See the Lions game last year.   Our defense was more responsible for that loss than anybody. There is absolutely ZERO reason a team should be able to drive 65+ yards with 1:40 left and no timeouts to get into field goal range. Smith certainly played a role in the outcome, as any coach does, but we had numerous opportunities to put that game on ice both offensively and defensively.    I don't even know how you could consider this a controversial opinion at this point.   That Mike Smith was the sole reason we didn't make it to a Superbowl? Yeah, that's controversial, and doesn't make sense in the context of what actually happened in the NFCCG. I'm not denying in the slightest that Smitty made some questionable calls late into games, but I just find it completely disingenuous that you guys continuously use him as our scapegoat."
falcons,3cb0w2,jetlife_,2,Mon Jul 6 16:19:44 2015 UTC,"but I just find it completely disingenuous that you guys continuously use him as our scapegoat.   I don't think that in an overall sense. He had to have done a lot of things right to even get us to the NFCCG. But my original comment was a reply to the specific ""ten yards away..."" in which I'm saying if our second half coaching/planning was as good as initial game planning, we would've closed out that game (among many others) and not even been in that situation."

I don't think you're giving enough credit to the 49ers as a team, or the fact that Ryan really fucked up on those two instances in the 3rd quarter.   Considering how those drives were moving I don't think there is any doubt that we would have gotten points out of them. We were at midfield when Ryan threw the pick, and on their 30-yard line when he dropped the shotgun snap. The coaching/planning is not the reason we failed to close out the game on those drives, Matt Ryan is. It's a shitty thing to admit because he really did play great, in spite of our nonexistent running game and the injury he may have sustained; the mistakes he made just happened to come at really poor times. We were in the ""ten yards away..."" situation primarily because of those mistakes.  The offensive play calling was still effective, even considering how brutal our running game was. Turner was injured and Quizz ended up looking like a Pop Warner player in comparison to the 49ers defense - coaching had nothing to do with that."
falcons,3cb0w2,jetlife_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:43:50 2015 UTC,I wouldn't give Smith and staff the primary blame for the 2nd half if it wasn't a trend under his tenure.
falcons,3cb0w2,wbarker11,-1,Mon Jul 6 18:03:13 2015 UTC,"What? That's clearly a logical fallacy. You basically are admitting that you have no idea if Smith was completely to blame for the second half of the NFCCG, but because of a few other questionable decisions during his tenure, he must be guilty.  In fact this whole argument could be a case study on cognitive biases.  Just a few that I've noticed;  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outcome_bias  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_effect  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_attribution_hypothesis  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindsight_bias  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_truth_effect  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveling_and_Sharpening"
falcons,3cb0w2,jetlife_,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:21:06 2015 UTC,"You don't think that maybe those turnovers came because we would run the ball for a yard on first and second down every single drive in the second half, and then only pass on the predictable passing downs? Instead of aggressively calling plays that kept the defense on its heels?   You conveniently blame the defense for giving up a TD during the 2 minute drill, but ignore the fact that Smith's horrible play calling and time management are the reasons that there was 1:40 left on the clock in the first place.   Don't think I ever said that Smith was the sole reason that we didn't go to the Super Bowl. A key drop at the end of the game was a big reason as well. Smith was just the biggest reason."

Those turnovers had nothing to do with our lack of a ground game, they were completely uncontested errors by Ryan.   Well our running backs were horrible, man. Turner was injured for most of the game and Quizz looked like a child against the 49ers defense. We actually DID find some success in the running game with Snelling in the second half, but you can't rely on a guy like that during an NFCCG.  The play calling was still relatively effective in the second half, we had numerous should-be scoring drives.   You conveniently blame the defense for giving up a TD during the 2 minute drill, but ignore the fact that Smith's horrible play calling and time management are the reasons that there was 1:40 left on the clock in the first place.   I think you forgot to read the part where I said;   Smith certainly played a role in the outcome   Our defense shouldn't have allowed them to execute that drive, that's what it really comes down to. If our defense had even a sliver of competence, we wouldn't even be talking about Smith's error.   Smith was just the biggest reason.   But why though?"

Do you not remember Matt Ryan having two HUGE turnovers in the third quarter? Or Vernon Davis completely exposing our undersized secondary?

I'm sure there is, but you don't know what that ""reason"" is because you're not Mike Smith."
falcons,3cb0w2,jetlife_,5,Mon Jul 6 16:28:39 2015 UTC,"I agree with some of your points in this thread, but I don't think you can place a lot of blame on Ryan for the loss.  First of all, he had arguably his best performance as a pro passing for 396 yards against a top ranked defense.  Secondly, only the fumble was really HIS fault.  Roddy fell over after Ryan had already thrown it, that's a routine slant if Roddy doesn't trip.  I blame coaching, questionable refereeing, and Harry Douglas before I blame Ryan.  Outside of that though, I do agree with you that people are taking this Mike Smith stuff to far.  I can't say he's a bad coach because he took a patch-work team with not a lot hope to the playoffs four times.  He did amazing things for Atlanta.  Were there questionable calls along the way? Sure, but there's no denying that he's the greatest coach we've ever had."

Roddy fell over after Ryan had already thrown it, that's a routine slant if Roddy doesn't trip.   Eh, I don't know about that. The throw just wasn't a good decision; came way too late and was wide of Roddy to the left. Even if he doesn't stumble I don't think Roddy had a chance at catching that one.

falcons,3bzmba,cteez910,2,Fri Jul 3 16:15:06 2015 UTC,The reaction to the drama makes me want to leave reddit 1000% more than the actual drama itself.
falcons,3bzmba,StudandStuff,3,Fri Jul 3 20:51:41 2015 UTC,The past 24 hours of Reddit have been like a South Park episode where no one except Stan and Kyle see the absurdity of what's going on.
falcons,3bzmba,DevotedCypress,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:54:49 2015 UTC,Can someone explain to me what exactly is happening?
falcons,3bzmba,KrustyBeaver,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:14:33 2015 UTC,"'Protesting'. Random subs are shutting down bc some admin got fired, and they don't know why she was fired. They are trying to show the admins that you can't just fuck us around, but really they are fucking us because we come to each sub for fun, for something to do, and they took that away from us which is basically what the admins did to them. It's horrible that they think this will help the cause and its even worse that people support it, all for some random girl who was good at her job."
falcons,3bzmba,ATL_GritzBlitz,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:15:56 2015 UTC,"Heavily loved reddit admin was fired and no one knows why. She was very involved with setting up and conducting AMA's across reddit. Many subs are going private in protest. I for one think the whole thing is complete bullshit, not letting redditors like myself view certain subs is stupid. There are other ways to protest, this one mainly affects the users that can't view the subs they use."

falcons,3bzmba,Daxxtoon,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:55:08 2015 UTC,"This ""controversy"" is just annoying. If she really was so hard done by, she presumably is going to take them to court for unfair dismissal (Presumably since Im not from the US, so it could be different over there). Its quite literally people being outraged and protesting something they have no idea about  Also, it has nothing to do with these boards so keep them out of it for the users sake"
falcons,3c36rh,GOA374,16,Sat Jul 4 09:04:37 2015 UTC,"HAHAHAHA   if anything Vick can learn how to actually play qb from Matthew, Vick can't make him faster and he's already a good slider so there's nothing Vick can teach him"
falcons,3c36rh,kyojin25,45,Sat Jul 4 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"No, never.  Mike Vick will never be welcome back on this team no matter how good of a fit he is.  And just because you brought it up, this might be the biggest stretch ive ever seen for making a  case for Vick.  This makes no sense."

However I fully believe there will be a Vick/Falcons reunion one day, be it a number retiring ceremony or a a front office job, he'll be back."
falcons,3c36rh,uckTheSaints,20,Sun Jul 5 06:55:33 2015 UTC,"...If we retired Vick's number, I would be incredibly upset. That would be ridiculous."
falcons,3c36rh,uckTheSaints,-2,Sun Jul 5 16:44:55 2015 UTC,"I feel like it should be retired simply because of how associated the #7 is with Vick's time here. I'll never be able to see another player wear that number and not think of Vick, so I think it's worthy of retirement."

I wasn't a fan in the vick Era so this isn't a biased comment. The man loves atlanta and I think he'd push to retire here."
falcons,3c36rh,Chriiiiiiiiisss,22,Sun Jul 5 21:55:24 2015 UTC,"On paper it sounds nice, but Ryan isnt a running or scrambling QB to begin with.. And I wouldnt want him trying to run more. Vick was an Athletic Beast, a different bread of man than Ryan, but the same can be said for Ryan being different from Vick. And I like it, its a good thing.  Take their position, and put both of them at coaches of that position, and I think Matt Ryan would be the better QB Coach. Vick would learn more from Ryan as a QB."
falcons,3c36rh,Jbots,2,Sat Jul 4 10:04:08 2015 UTC,I agree with everything you said. With that said I bet matt ryan runs a zone read play at least 3 times this season. You want the over or under?
falcons,3c36rh,Chriiiiiiiiisss,5,Sat Jul 4 22:33:41 2015 UTC,"I can see it now;   Week 14 against the Panthers, who have shown up this season to make just as good of a play off run as the Falcons, both teams showing they deserve to head the NFC South with a tied division record. 4th quarter nearing a close with the Falcons down 26-21, Panthers coming off a drive that ended with a field goal and the kitty cats pumped that they took away our chance to tie it with our own field goal. Their coaches feeling confident.  3rd down, 2 yards to go before entering red zone territory, game obviously on the line. Matt Ryan in the huddle receiving the play call, the Bank of America Stadium is just thundering with applause. In from the side lines comes Freeman, whos had an above average year for an average of over 100 yards per game so far, coming back in for Coleman who was subbing in, and has also killed it this year and shown the league how sneaky of a player he is with multiple 20+ yard break away runs this season. Just this game Freeman had tallied up 150+, having an explosive first half and making his presence known.  Clocks ticking now, play getting ready to start. Line getting now as they break huddle, Ryan in gun with Freeman to his left. Ryans staring into the backfield, past Lotulei, past Kuechly, past Mr. Harper, just eyes set on the End Zone.   Everyones set, he yells once- He yells twice with a foot stomp- Tamme now setting off in motion across the back of the line- The ball hiked and the play now live as it hits Matt's hands! He extends them out and Freeman ducks into him- And then taking off up the middle! Exploding into the back of our line and then cutting away into a hole Asomoah had opened. BOOM!- Kuechly's there to stop him in his tracks along with Blue Cats Johnson who read the play and cut in on our tackle to grab at Freemans ankles. But wait..!   Freeman fumbles into Kuechly's arms- Not having the ball! It was a ruse! Not more than a second after Freeman had taken off up the middle, QB Matt Ryan had taken off up the left side of the field where it was now open. The excellent fake hand off was set up perfectly with Panthers DE Johnson being so sure Freeman would have the ball, that it left the left side of the field open!  Ryan gains 8 perfect yards before running out of bounds, fooling everyone and leaving an icy trail of bliss on the field where he ran, putting the Atlanta Falcons in the Red Zone and giving them a perfect shot to score and win.  EDIT: Also wouldnt suprise me to see it a little more with Shanahans offense, he'd get a big bad boner bamboozling defenses with our white boy QB runs."
falcons,3c36rh,mubs42,14,Sun Jul 5 00:36:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think Mike can teach him anything the coaches can't. Plus, bringing him here would just be a huge distraction.  I also don't think Arthur Blank would want to bring him back to the team."
falcons,3c36rh,stdfan,6,Sat Jul 4 11:42:41 2015 UTC,When QBs run they get hit and that shortens their life span in the NFL. I want him to run as little as possible. Also Vick didn't run in the smartest way. He held the ball away from his body and lost a lot of fumbles. If he came here to teach Ryan things I think Vick would be the one who learned more.
falcons,3c36rh,wbarker11,6,Sat Jul 4 12:54:01 2015 UTC,"Vick didn't ""know"" how to run. He was athletic and fast enough that he just ran. In fact, the way he held on to the ball and consistently got hurt, you could argue that he doesn't really know much at all about being a running QB in the NFL."
falcons,3c36rh,delk82,5,Sat Jul 4 17:05:57 2015 UTC,I'd say he's a real underdog to get the job.
falcons,3c36rh,Jbots,2,Sat Jul 4 17:41:40 2015 UTC,It would be a shock.

falcons,3c36rh,abesrevenge,5,Sat Jul 4 14:25:11 2015 UTC,Lol. Like Vick will magically be able to teach Matt Ryan to run around like a fool. Even if Ryan developed the speed and agility he would never be allowed to run more than a few feet out of bounds or slide.
falcons,3c36rh,terri_dahoo,5,Mon Jul 6 16:31:24 2015 UTC,"And we can also bring Chris Miller back and he can teach Matty how to play without legs,,,,,just in case."
falcons,3c36rh,PANTTERA,5,Mon Jul 6 03:36:03 2015 UTC,Vick can't even teach Matt how to run the ball. Vick had one thing that cant be taught...speed. Take that away and Vick is not ever in the NFL. Vick TD/INT is close to 50/50. Throw in MVs fumbles/sacks and you get games of hair pulling disappointment peppered with awe inspiring amazement.

falcons,3c36rh,Beef_Jones,-1,Thu Jul 9 17:43:44 2015 UTC,"The problem is Mike Vick throws lefty and Matt Ryan throws right, otherwise it would be a great idea. Vick has so much he could teach a young guy like Matt in the film room."
falcons,3c36rh,SzamarCsacsi,13,Sat Jul 4 09:44:18 2015 UTC,"young guy like Matt   Matt Ryan is 30. He's not a rookie QB. He's also better and an entirely different QB than Vick. He's not built for running around with the ball, he's too fragile. I also think he has a better understanding at the game despite that 5 years difference between them."

falcons,3btp4p,JacksWastedTime,30,Thu Jul 2 01:58:25 2015 UTC,lol at being unranked last year. People voted AP in this year even though he did not play a down. Julio had 580 yds in 5 games. Fuck that shit. The salt is real.
falcons,3btp4p,reddier5,2,Thu Jul 2 02:33:28 2015 UTC,AD did actually play one game
falcons,3btp4p,Leakee,3,Thu Jul 2 06:03:59 2015 UTC,"While Julio not being in the list last year is absolute bullshit, AP being on the list this year isn't. The list isn't ranking players' performances of last year, even though that is typically the primary basis for their ranking. It's a list of where these players will be this upcoming season. It is meant to get hype for the new season but it has never really come off that way. Hell, half the players voting don't know that's the case. Same thing happened with Peyton after he missed a year.  So yeah, since AP is playing this year him being on the list is perfectly acceptable to me."
falcons,3btp4p,Supertilt,3,Thu Jul 2 03:39:14 2015 UTC,If it predicts where people will be in the next season then AP is vastly underrated and Peyton Manning is vastly overrated.

falcons,3btp4p,Supertilt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:38:09 2015 UTC,It's beyond ridiculous. This past off-season the story has been Matt Ryan Julio Jones being overrated. Unrated Julio Jones is just damn stupid!!!!

falcons,3btp4p,el_toastradamus,6,Thu Jul 2 05:14:19 2015 UTC,"Only Brown and Calvin ahead of him? Very nice. I expected Dez to be above him based on name, but i love to see Julio so high. Next up is getting Tru on the list next year."
falcons,3btp4p,brownrd2,4,Thu Jul 2 18:23:16 2015 UTC,"Well deserved. Dude's a beast, and I think this is a fair ranking of his standing in the league."
falcons,3btp4p,DevotedCypress,3,Thu Jul 2 02:13:16 2015 UTC,"God damn, this video gets me so amped. Proud he is finally getting the credit he deserves around league circles. Dude is an absolute animal. Great and fair ranking. One thing I will say, if Trufant isn't on this list next year, it will be downright criminal. He's a top 5 or 6 corner already. Might be my Falcons bias coming out, but he is next in line behind Julio for not getting enough credit and attention league wide. He needs to be on this list."
falcons,3btp4p,Steffnov,4,Thu Jul 2 04:56:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Tru is a top 5 corner as of yet (behind Sherman, Revis and Haden is a very tough crowd with names like Vontae Davis, Harris Jr., Rhodes, Peterson (I have to add him, still), perhaps Flowers, Jimmy Smith, and obviously Tru himself). He could very well make the stop next year though, but that's a competitive position."
falcons,3btp4p,DevotedCypress,3,Thu Jul 2 13:51:16 2015 UTC,"I'd put Harris in the same group as the first three you mentioned. IMO, he's elite now. Peterson is super close to that group of 4 as well. But after those 5, you'd be hard pressed to argue that Des isn't the next best corner. I fully believe he's better than Flowers, Rhodes, Smith, and Davis. Just one man's opinion though."
falcons,3btp4p,ladditude,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:36:57 2015 UTC,Peterson is at the bottom of the group. I don't understand how he gets so hyped
falcons,3btp4p,DevotedCypress,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:02:37 2015 UTC,"I don't either. I honestly think my favourite game of last season was when we played the Cards, and Julio torched him for 200+ after Peterson talked smack all week and Julio kept his mouth shut."
falcons,3btp4p,Leakee,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:27:53 2015 UTC,I think he was already on this year's list at like 90.
falcons,3btp4p,DevotedCypress,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:05:36 2015 UTC,"I scrolled through the whole list. Didn't see him, but maybe I just missed it. I could be wrong.   EDIT: Just double checked, Tru is definitely NOT on this year's list. Only Matty (77) and Julio (13). So I stand by my first statement. He NEEDS to be on this list next year."

falcons,3btp4p,p1ckmatt,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:29:07 2015 UTC,"Screw Dez and all the Cowboy fans thinking that Dez deserves to be higher on the list than Julio.  Julio has more receiving yards, more receiving yards per reception, and more yards after catch.  He is also the all time NFL leader in receiving yards per game played.    This was a player's vote, and Julio is a player's player.  He deserves to be ahead of Dez.  Also both of them matched up against Patrick Peterson this season.  Dez had 2 receptions racking up 15 yards and 1 touchdown while Julio had 10 receptions and 186 yards with 1 touchdown.  Fuck all the haters that's a direct comparison."
falcons,3btp4p,Hot_Lanta,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:56:31 2015 UTC,The cowboys also had Weeden playing at QB that game. So it's an unfair comparison.
