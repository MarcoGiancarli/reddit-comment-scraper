Good thing he survived to terrible pogroms of North Jersey during his youth.  Meanwhile an objective truth teller like Blumenthal is marginalized by Zionists who refuse to hear the truth."

israelexposed,3dsr86,FAREEQAWAL,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:34:35 2015 UTC,"You're a moderator of /r/Palestine right? (We had a conversation in /r/Arabs about that and the fact that your other mod, /u/WiseCynic banned me for questioning his legitimacy in dealing with anything related to Palestine, as he appears not to have any basic understanding of the issue).  Well, /u/WiseCynic, that same moderator, has said in /r/Palestine that this whole thing is a lie, even though there's documented proof of Israel doing this.  Just a heads up that, once again, your moderator doesn't have a clue what he's talking about, and is spreading misinformation in /r/Palestine. If he wants to, I suppose he could once again ban the OP (and his post) for the mere fact of disagreeing with him. Pretty chilling how dangerous that kind of censorship is.  I still haven't heard back from the mods of /r/Palestine about being banned arbitrarily. Any updates on that?  edited to provide links"
israelexposed,3dsr86,ub3rm3nsch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:49:06 2015 UTC,It's fairly obvious. Post anything slightly anti-israel in a main sub and get hate. I randomly got called an anti-Semite and bigot because I'm against Israeli foreign policy. Never mind that I'm a semite. Never mind that I appreciate Jewish culture. Never mind that I have never slandered or insulted Jews ...

So much so, that this military publication justifies the abuse and murder of Palestinians because people who aren't satisfied with the sex God gave them hate Palestinians.   unbelievable."

All this despite having logs and records of doing business within Israel. The other non visual colleagues enter within 30 - 45 mins.  Yes, they hate traveling to Israel with me. lol But, they have no choice. I'm their boss... mwahahahahah."

israelexposed,3cztn6,nsindi,3,Sun Jul 12 07:28:31 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of this https://youtu.be/aF5UfnhuF_c  It seems to be a common  technique amongst zionists, stir up anti jJewish hatred and then lobby governments to change the law, provide more security to Israelis and Jews.   I'm skeptical of do called hare crimes targeting Jews such as swastikas on Jewish sites. Blacks and Muslims are equally hated as Jews in the UK. But you won't see and hate speech sprayed on Muslim or black areas. Racism in the UK is much more covert then that. So it does raise an eyebrow when swastikas appear on Jewish cemeteries."

I didn't understand why my mom carried me in the middle of the night to the door, until I was a little older and we knew it wasn't mapping. It's the same reason  IDF jeeps and humvees stroll the streets of quiet Palestinian towns. They would literally roam the town with no apparent cause just to build fear, we all knew that."

israelexposed,3bgl7k,Jacecam32,5,Mon Jun 29 07:08:08 2015 UTC,Why are you shocked? If you debate with Zionists online you should see they typically put Palestine/Palestinian in quotation marks and typically deny Palestinian identity or existence. I've debated with Israelis online about Gaza and they will take issue with me using the word Palestinian and turn the conversation into how Palestinians don't exist.   Even Golda Meir famously stated Palestinians don't exist.
