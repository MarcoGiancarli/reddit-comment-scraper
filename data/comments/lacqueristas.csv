My favourite is a little cheapo pink one I got with some cheeky plates from amazon.  The moyou stamper is terrible at picking up the design, and the ends constantly fall off."

lacqueristas,3d7t36,Larye,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:03:01 2015 UTC,"I've ordered various non-name brand plates from Amazon and ebay, I have loads now (maybe around 100?) and think in total I've paid maybe ¬£15? The scraper/stamper that comes with them is fine to use.  As for nail varnishes to use, I think Konad do special stamping polishes, but I've never tried them. You just have to try all your polishes and see which work and which don't. I find maybelline colours tend to work well, particularly the forever stay stuff =] hope this helps!"

lacqueristas,3d6fh3,mamala18,3,Mon Jul 13 22:20:53 2015 UTC,"This one looks plain blue but it has a blue base with a pink opalescent sheen/glitter. If you google Sinful Colors Cinderella you'll see better pictures. This might not be exactly what you're looking for, but I have this so it was the first thing that came to mind.  I think your best bet might be OPI's Polka.com but it would need to be worn over a base coat as it's very loose glitter.  Sinful Colors' Frenzy is another decent option.  If all else fails you could also layer glitter polishes to get the desired shades. Use a base of tightly packed glitter like Sally Hansen's Wedding Crasher or Essie's Lots of Lux with a top layer of loose glitter like one of Sally Hansen's sequin overcoat polishes. Not limiting yourself to trying to find one polish with exactly the right colors gives you more possibilities and will let you choose whether you want pink or blue to dominate.   Hope this helped!"

lacqueristas,3cxnp6,silentwail,3,Sat Jul 11 18:24:05 2015 UTC,Lazy and reverse stamping shouldn't ever be put in the same sentence together because what you did is awesome.  Your nails look amazing!
