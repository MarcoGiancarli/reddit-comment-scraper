ImaginaryMindscapes,3d0k1z,Erilaz,2,Sun Jul 12 15:44:51 2015 UTC,I think he did it that way because that's how the article spells it on his DeviantArt page so would it still be better to put a space there?
ImaginaryMindscapes,3d0k1z,upvotes2doge,1 point,Mon Jul 13 09:03:13 2015 UTC,"For sure. Per Rule #2 on the sidebar, we use artist real name instead of their DA alias. But in this case, the DA alias is the real name, only without spaces. We will tend not to remove a post that is only missing spaces in the name, even though it still upsets the search function.   The idea is that an artist might have many alias' across websites like tumblr, artstation, DA, etc. So if we use the real name, reposts can be kept to a minimum by searching the artist name before posting."

ImaginaryMindscapes,3caoi5,Mr_OsO,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:53:19 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that all the Seraphim have seven pairs of wings in some writings. After looking at Morbacher's page for this series, he is drawing inspiration from the Book of Enoch. From what I've read Azrael and Uriel are two separate angels associated with the south and the east respectively. The symbolism in the work is more in line with your observation though. Coming with the sun and offering the fiery apple are the biggest two. Halos or divine radiance, while commonly depicted as radiant rings, were actually described as beaming rays or hornlike emanations of light. It's very well done here appearing nearly to be both a more common halo and the traditional description.  Clockwise from 2 on around(my artistic/symbolic interpretation) his hands are in gestures of: teaching, offering, revealing(knowledge), guiding, giving(knowledge), wanting, and seizing. There's a lot of action and personality in this. He really nailed his goal of personification of a divine creature in this one."
ImaginaryMindscapes,3caoi5,Stackingpatterns,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:07:04 2015 UTC,"yeah he's an angel after all. And from what I've read, he is one of the four most sacred angel who are closest to god before he was been classified as the fallen angel. See I don't really mind if we will differ about the opinion on it's identity, i mean we all free to choose in what we want to believe and that made us look unto something in so many different perspectives. And it make things a bit more interesting to me, just reading your story made me want to read everything about mythologies now. That's how great this story affects me really. So i hope these artworks will continue to express more of stuffs like these, I'm really looking forward seeing more of these.

ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,Dirty-Freakin-Dan,7,Sun Jul 5 21:57:05 2015 UTC,That's incredible.
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,comienzo,13,Mon Jul 6 01:31:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, unfortunately that bit didn't make it into the game"
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,noneedforpants,6,Mon Jul 6 02:07:47 2015 UTC,After $500mil you'd think they wouldn't have left a single thing out... :/
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,DavidLovato,3,Mon Jul 6 03:23:53 2015 UTC,"They may not have. That $500 million is for three games + marketing over ten years, not just Destiny. That's why you see concept art for Chicago and Saturn and all kinds of places and creatures that aren't in the first game; it's concept art for the whole series.  This picture, for example, looks like the European Dead Zone, which so far hasn't been seen in-game aside from one PVP map that was recently added."
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,Snuggadillo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:07:56 2015 UTC,They're making more? Oh god. Wasnt one warframe knock off enough?
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,WillyTheWackyWizard,2,Mon Jul 6 23:59:03 2015 UTC,"Google Destiny Concept Art, a lot of is fucking amazing.   Which is more than I can say about the game."
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,ghostdate,4,Mon Jul 6 06:10:13 2015 UTC,"I remember seeing some early stuff posted on Facebook by one of the top freelance concept artists, and it had a sniper looking character hiding behind some jungle like plants as a platoon of enemies walked single file through the brush just meters away. It made the game look so intense, and like the next big sci-fi shooter. Then it came out and it just didn't have the awe-inspiring atmosphere of the artwork, and the gameplay was like halo/borderlands, but not the good parts of either."
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,Krehlmar,5,Mon Jul 6 09:07:10 2015 UTC,Where did it all go wrong
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,Jandelles,2,Mon Jul 6 06:17:40 2015 UTC,Here's a Google Image Search for more high-res Destiny concept art.
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,JaxonIsAwesome,6,Mon Jul 6 08:33:08 2015 UTC,Too bad the game was shit. It had so much potential. :(
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,Snuggadillo,4,Mon Jul 6 04:49:51 2015 UTC,The only reason people had to dislike it was the story. The gameplay and graphics are amazing.
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,Baldemyr,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:21:33 2015 UTC,No. The graphics were on par with what should be expected from a triple A next gen title and are already outdated. The gameplay was repetitive and completely derivative from other shooters. Don't defend a bad game.
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,MrMeowing,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:00:15 2015 UTC,"Such awesome concept art.  This should have been such a wonderful game with the promise of a full ""universe"" added as the months went by.  Instead we get two lame add ons with little to no more story missions(second one was better).  It is such an empty game-so freaking frustrating"
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c8h9v,guidorosso,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:52:11 2015 UTC,Destiny had a lot of potential. I never got on the hype train because until it's release I knew nothing about it. The game was ok. Nothing special.

ImaginaryMindscapes,3c7cwg,ethan_kahn,12,Sun Jul 5 15:55:12 2015 UTC,"http://www.artstation.com/artist/sarmati[1]  Some words from the artist regarding this piece:  Rusałka is a slavic female demon usually appearing around lakes, ponds or rivers. She deceives men and drowns them. I wanted to show her as a dead corpse that uses a charm, so that she looks like a pretty woman when out of the water.  I've had some voices wondering about the swastikas on the rims of the guys shirt. So to make it clear. I have no connotations with any extreme right wing parties nor do I keep any nazi or racist oriented beliefs. Swastika has been used for hundreds of years in Poland, before Hitler stole it and spoilt it for everyone. The action of the image takes place in 9th or 10th century. If you want to know more about swastikas just wiki it. There is a really broad and interesting article written about it."
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c7cwg,Ensvey,6,Sun Jul 5 15:55:25 2015 UTC,Reminds me of the Rusalka in Quest for Glory

ImaginaryMindscapes,3c6wsq,rivenis,3,Sun Jul 5 12:40:02 2015 UTC,Looks like one of those spriggen from skyrim. Looks cool though. Very sad but also kinda creepy.

ImaginaryMindscapes,3c2tku,jatora,-9,Sat Jul 4 05:57:55 2015 UTC,Artists linking their own sites with shittyass servers instead of using deviant/imgur etc. are fucking moronsm
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c2tku,JakeVanderArkWriter,5,Sat Jul 4 13:30:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't make this, calm down. Linking the artist's own website, where all of his art can be found, makes more sense than some random imgur album."
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c2tku,jatora,2,Sat Jul 4 13:47:07 2015 UTC,"I've spoken with Archan several times, and Tompkinz is not him. The site loads just as quickly as Imgur, so calm down."
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c2tku,theyellowgoat,-1,Sat Jul 4 14:07:02 2015 UTC,"I'm aware tompkinz is not him, I never said that. It's still retarded. Loads like trash on mobile and rapes your visibility."
ImaginaryMindscapes,3c2tku,Daannii,2,Sat Jul 4 20:44:43 2015 UTC,Awesome! Definitely one of my favorite artists on deviantart.
