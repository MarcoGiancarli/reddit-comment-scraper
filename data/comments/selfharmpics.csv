The left side wasn't quite numb enough to properly stitch and the steri strips didn't hold very well which is why it opened up a bit, but my doctor did the best she could (that's all I can ask for) and I think it's healing nicely, other than a bit of irritation."

I focused on health instead of illness. I moved forward with my life. I set goals and achieved accomplishments for myself.

selfharmpics,3dsokf,drowningwithoutwater,4,Sun Jul 19 02:07:10 2015 UTC,"For those interested. I was feeling suicidal and I mean this was intense. Earlier that afternoon I was screened by my psych because I said I was having thoughts of suicide. I wasn't admitted and had mixed feelings. I was glad I didn't have to be forced back into the hospital but I was defeated knowing what I was planning to do.   So I went home, ran a bath, and slipped into the hot water. Long story short my thoughts of ""fuck it"" turned to ""fuck I can't do enough"". So I stopped. Wrapped my arm up, stopped the bleeding and applied steri-strips.   It has come together nicely and healing okay. It looks really obvious though and I can't get a picture to really illustrate that it definitely looks like a suicide attempt.   I still have mixed feelings about the whole psych and suicide screening thing. Been debating it in my head, maybe I need a break. It's emotionally exhausting to pretend in front of loved ones but the disappointment of them seeing me as a ""failure"" by returning to the hospital is weighing heavy on my mind. I've been asked if I thought hospital would help again, just briefly, a week or two. My eating disorder has been very active and I'm unable to eat as I should. Very easy to fall into, impossible to climb out. Stabilizing my eating disorder relapse would also happen in the hospital, but I hate the damn obs with meals and after meals and...ugh everything. So I said oh yeah it would help me but I'm not ready to go sign myself in.   I'm worried this week when I see my psych as I hadn't sought any medical help or even called anyone when I did this half-ass attempt. I don't know how my psych will respond because undoubtedly this will be discussed.   But I'm really on the fence. I feel like a break would be good for my sanity and health. And I know the routine of the unit, what to bring and what not to, and how it's helped in the past. I'll see how my appointment goes with my psych and will really think on this more. One of my goals in treatment is to avoid re-hospitalization, so a third hospitalization is something that is used only when I really and truly need it. I don't know if that's now."
selfharmpics,3drrp9,WastedShadow,2,Sat Jul 18 20:51:03 2015 UTC,"Stitches for these wounds are appropriate and I would encourage getting them, and larger wounds can be stitched later than smaller wounds.   I struggle to see how you could steri-strip this, it's gaping quite a bit and the edges could be difficult to pull together.   This isn't pathetic. No self-harm is pathetic despite the size or type of wound. Those thoughts prevent us from getting help, for me I had to get out the thinking ""well it's not as bad as it could be"". Very similar to thinking ""I'm not sick enough"".   Leaving this open has a high risk of infection. More severe infections are a real possibility, sepsis (blood poisoning) can occur because of the large and very direct path into your body. Healing will take longer. Scarring will be more pronounced as well. It's your choice in the end, but based on my personal experience of recommend at least having it seen by a medical professional."
selfharmpics,3drrp9,drowningwithoutwater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"I know that I shouldn't view my self harm as pathetic and when I see others who might ""just"" do scratches I don't think that. I know that any kind of self harm is bad but when it comes to myself, I'm pretty hard on me. And I am not nearly as bad as I used to be and I surely don't do as much damage as I used to/want to do. So when it comes to size, and size really does matter for me when it come to self harm, this is shit for me. Again, I don't think so when I see others' sh. Just I deserve so much worse. And I can really relate to the thought of not being sick enough. Actually I don't think I'm sick at all. Just an attention seeking cow. But yeah. I got carried away somehow."

selfharmpics,3dp4dl,addicted7,3,Sat Jul 18 02:38:33 2015 UTC,"Please, please get to a doctor to get those dressed properly. It will make a world of difference, and speaking from experience infection is a very real thing and the last thing you want.   I also really hope you're talking to a professional about what's going on? If you're seeing someone and they aren't helping, see someone else. You're not alone in this and there are an abundance of people out there who want to help you if you'll let them - but they can't help if you don't reach out.   You could also consider planning ahead for the next time you get urges like this: have numbers on hand that you can call, and a small list of things to do that will get your endorphins going and keep your mind off things until the urges pass (and they will pass).   It's a process to quit harming. Especially when it takes cuts as deep as yours to get the desired effect. But it is entirely possible, for everyone... and that includes you.   Feel free to get in touch if you ever want a friend to talk to... I've been in a similar situation, and I'm more than happy to talk any time.   I hope you don't mind, but I'll be keeping you in my thoughts and prayers over the next little while, and really hoping you get the energy/motivation/kick that you need to tackle this once and for all."
selfharmpics,3dp4dl,njerome,3,Sat Jul 18 07:20:06 2015 UTC,"I'm going to leave them alone and open for now and just take care of them by myself. Don't have the energy to wait in the emergency room to get stitches for many hours or to go see a doctor. I should get it dressed properly but I know I can look after it on my own. At least that's what I think I can.  I do have a regular case manager, been seeing her for about 1-2 months now(had numerous support before her). She is great and probably the best support I could have right now. It hasn't really helped but it's been nice to have some support that I feel is somewhat beneficial.  I like to think I'm doing my best to get better but the truth is that I'm not really. Sure, I go regular appointments but it's takes a lot more than just attending to get ""better"". I'm more or less just tempting faith till I kill myself, whether accidental or not. I personally don't want to get better, just part of my human instinct wants something better than this abuse I inflict on myself. Hence why I still go to regular appointments.  I know what's needed to get better but as of right now, I'm not capable of making that decision. Kind of just want to go further down in this darkness and see what else I can do to myself.  I don't know, I guess I've just given up on having a future :/ hopefully something can change my mind, otherwise I'll be continually treading on this fine line between death.  Now thanks for your comment, I truly do appreciate all the people that reach out to me on this subreddit. It's weird, I feel so alone in the real world but on here, it's like my escape! I hope you have a truly good day :) Stay safe!"
selfharmpics,3dp4dl,njerome,2,Sat Jul 18 11:03:36 2015 UTC,"You seem like a pretty switched on person... More so than most. Does it make sense to you when I say that ""I don't want to get better"" etc. that it's most likely symptomatic of pretty serious mental health issues? ie... if you were of sound mind, you wouldn't be thinking and feeling what you are currently. In that respect it's incredibly dangerous to wait and see if you feel different/until you get the motivation to really get yourself better.  It's one of the most difficult parts... acknowledging that you need to make the effort to see change, not change in order to encourage effort. If that makes sense?  If you can, look at your situation as objectively as possible. What would you say if you were advising me? Arguably nothing, and I don't mean to assume anything... only trying to demonstrate that it is more than worth it to apply as much of yourself as you can into bettering your health. Not for your current self - for the future self that will wish she had acted sooner.   Do you actually have the means/knowledge to clean/dress those cuts properly? At least steri strips?   I really don't mean to be a pest, I'm sorry. I'm just worried for you. Hope you're doing okay."
selfharmpics,3dp4dl,Lenaballerina,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:45:45 2015 UTC,"That makes total sense to me, not wanting to get better basically means I've lost all care, which in turn supports the idea of a worsening mental health issue.   For a very long time I thought I was doing everything in my power to see change, I thought I was putting a great deal of effort in my life. But in all honesty, I was lying to myself because it was easier to think I tried and failed instead of failing because I never tried. If that makes sense. Only recently, like the past 6 months, I really learnt I wasn't doing what was required to see that change I wanted. I though my support could change me, that attending appointments was enough. But the truth is, change is down to the individual and no matter how hard you want to change someone, you just can't. You can only advise until they make that decision for themselves. It's like teaching someone to swim, you can give them the skills but when there alone, it's up to them to use those skills to survive in the water.  If I was advising you, I would basically say what you have. Basically try advise you that finding that effort and motivation to get better is worth it and the sooner you do it, the better the outcome may be.   When your lost in this circle of not caring, it's hard to put effort in. It's like you've got no energy because you don't see a possible future. So it's hard to better my health when all I want to do is destruct. The only solution I see is to put myself in a psych ward until I'm able to make non-destructive decisions and reduce my risk from self-harm/suicide to see if it helps. But that solution just brings on so many more issues, in the short-term it's a possible positive situation but it just causes me long term issues associated with it.  Honestly I'm stuck, I don't care but I know I need to do something. It's so darn conflicting, the don't care part of me will ultimately win :/  I've got quite a far bit of knowledge and a little bit of means to look after the cuts. Ultimately should be enough to be okay, haven't really ever had any major issue through my time as a self-harmer. So should be fine :)  Your far from being a pest, no need to apologise. I appreciate your reply, so thanks :) I hope you're doing okay too!  P.S. Apologies for long rambling reply :D"

selfharmpics,3dfj9h,myheartisnumb,3,Thu Jul 16 00:57:43 2015 UTC,"Depending on the doctor and severity stitches can be given even when the wound has started to heal.   I had two cuts that needed stitches and were already healing. My doctor advised getting stitches to minimize scarring and help properly heal. I had to sign a release saying I knew there were risks and I wouldn't sue anyone of something went wrong.   I was given local anesthetic and couldn't feel anything. The cuts had to be flushed and the healing scabs had to be taken out. Essentially, they had to cause some re-injury in order to appropriately treat the cuts. Again this was painless, and I'm glad I got it done. It was weird for sure but worth it."

selfharmpics,3decuk,Rocketman288,2,Thu Jul 16 03:29:31 2015 UTC,"Well I hadn't been eating much that day (not an eating disorder, I was just feeling stressed) and I locked myself in the bathroom to cut.  I started sweating and feeling dizzy, I think from both the lack of food and my emotional state.  I fainted after trying to stand up and everyone heard me fall.  I probably could have hidden everything before they got in (I've never made deep cuts) but I guess I kind of accepted that it might be better to let them help me.  They were so nice, just got me some food and talked calmly about it.  I don't know how much I can help really, because I have hardly cut, only scratched myself and I am very close with my family so it wasn't too bad when they found out.  However, I do really recommend telling someone, if at all possible.  Especially a family member who would be there often."

You seem so casual and this is how it is about your injuries. I sincerely hope that your quality of mind and mental state becomes better someday.. I have read, I believe I have anyways, that you do not want to get better at this point in your disrepair. And I wish that you did, and I wish you still had hope. Although I know not a thing about you, I still believe that you, as strong as someone would have to be to harm themselves and feel so bad and not be gone already, can become satisfied and happy with life. I'm not sure at all if this is the right thing to say to you, or if your brain is so clouded with thoughts that are negative that anything anyone says to you won't mean a damn thing. I don't want to apologize or say im sorry this is like this or blah blah blah. I remember seeing on here that your mother passed too, I give my sincerest condolences for the loss. But she is still with you in your memories, and I assume(im sorry if this is wrong) that if you cared for her, she cared for you.  I'm not gonna end this with anything cliche. But really, and truly I am willing to lend an ear and a caring heart. Please take care and know that I acknowledge and care about you."
selfharmpics,3dbsss,paperscribbel,2,Wed Jul 15 02:23:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks man, that's oddly satisfying to hear since I'm not someone with cuts as huge as asherd addicted7 etc (sorry for not naming everyone and I'm proud of your progress asherd). You are correct, nice memory! I do not want to get better nor feel like I could ever reach a 'neutral' state in my life even if I tried for the rest of my life. I wouldn't call me brave though, I would say coward. I'm just biding my time until I kill myself (hopefully soon, I have more fentanyl shipping) because I'm terrified of the pain of most ways to kill yourself(Hanging,cutting deep enough to bleed out etc). I do have my happy spurts though, I abused the fentanyl shipment I got and had a great time! For the most part, I do read and understand what people say but never really consider it because my mind is made up already. (I am a huge hypocrite and try to talk people out of suicide a lot, so I can understand things falling on deaf ears etc) Yes yes yes, she is still with me in my memories everyday. The hospital visit was hard, I spent the most time with my mother in ER/ICU rooms and being there without her tore my heart in half, although I know she hated seeing me there. It's a horrible spot to see someone you love be in that situation but it was our shared spot and I'll always think of her in those spots. Thank-you very much for the condolences it truly means a lot. Thank-you! I have pretty bad anxiety so even social interaction online is pretty anxious, which is also part of the reason I don't want to get help. Most of the help for BPD is therapy, which, involves talking and interacting with people. Sadly, even on benzos I still have a bit of anxiety I'm not sure if I've just had a broad amount but I can't get them prescribed anyway so it's a hassle. Also, if you ever need to vent or what-not you can always pm me too!"

I immediately cracked a joke and they all burst out laughing, maybe out of pity.   The following weeks were difficult, nobody knew of my self-harm or drug use and everything came to light. For some reason I incurred a serious back injury in the process (my GP suspected foul play but I can't prove it), but I can't get any medication to help it. It's still fucked up but the only option doctors give me is to get back surgery since all non-narcotic medication didn't help. I am never returning to a hospital after my experience so that's out of the question.  Looking back at the medical records just make it hurt even more. I spent 5 days in the ICU then a mandatory 3 weeks in the psych ward. 2 medical personnel lost their jobs because of the way they treated me, only because my Dad is a local hero and complained to the heads of the hospital. Literally the worst time of my life.  My back still fucking hurts.  I hope you make a speedy recovery."

I did another - probably done for a bit now. http://imgur.com/otNmcgS  I'm doing CBT and seeing a psychiatrist. I don't know if I should tell them because I don't want to end up doing something like in-patient because I could lose my job. They think that I've stopped 2 months ago, but in reality I should go and get stitches (not doing that because I don't know what the hospital will do given that they know about my self-harm and suicide attempt).   I don't even really know why I do it - I wish I did. I wish I could turn back the clock and not do it."
selfharmpics,3d1hlt,shikataganaii,3,Sun Jul 12 20:57:17 2015 UTC,"From Wikipedia:   Class I Hemorrhage involves up to 15% of blood volume. There is typically no change in vital signs and fluid resuscitation is not usually necessary.  Class II Hemorrhage involves 15-30% of total blood volume. A patient is often tachycardic (rapid heart beat) with a narrowing of the difference between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The body attempts to compensate with peripheral vasoconstriction. Skin may start to look pale and be cool to the touch. The patient may exhibit slight changes in behavior. Volume resuscitation with crystalloids (Saline solution or Lactated Ringer's solution) is all that is typically required. Blood transfusion is not typically required.  Class III Hemorrhage involves loss of 30-40% of circulating blood volume. The patient's blood pressure drops, the heart rate increases, peripheral hypoperfusion (shock), such as capillary refill worsens, and the mental status worsens. Fluid resuscitation with crystalloid and blood transfusion are usually necessary.  Class IV Hemorrhage involves loss of >40% of circulating blood volume. The limit of the body's compensation is reached and aggressive resuscitation is required to prevent death.   The average adult has about 5 litres of blood  You should also consider the long-term effects of a severed nerve, serious infection, and scarring. Keep the wounds clean and try to close them with tape/butterfly bandages. You might consider learning to give yourself stitches.  EDIT: The reactions of medical professionals appear to me unpredictable. Psychologists (I only know for sure about Ontario) cannot divulge any information you have given them during sessions unless they believe you to be a serious danger to yourself or others. They take liberties with this rule due to its ambiguity. Don't take my word for it, but I don't think you can be fired for being sectioned. An anecdote: I was able to get stitches for self-harm wounds about 6 times over a 4 month period at a walk-in clinic in Ontario before they threatened to send me to the hospital. I was 16 at the time.  I wish you well, friend."
selfharmpics,3d1hlt,nameless33395,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:34:49 2015 UTC,How do you learn to do stiches? Is it possible to learn that even if you don't have deep cuts yourself? maybe via some sort of volunteering in the medical world?
selfharmpics,3d1hlt,shikataganaii,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:15:05 2015 UTC,"Stitches are relatively simple to do, provided the wound is no deeper than the subcutaneous fat. Just be sure to do your own research, as I’m by no means a medical professional.   Step one: evaluate the wound. Is it dirty? Is it deeper than the subcutaneous fat? Is it more than 8 hours old? Is it bleeding profusely? If so, DO NOT close the wound with sutures.  Step two: prepare a sterile working area with all your supplies  Step three: apply topical lidocaine It probably won’t make a huge difference, and you can skip this step if you want. If you can get your hands on subcutaneous lidocaine, go for it.  Step four: scrub the wound thoroughly with an antiseptic  Step five: close the wound with sutures. These videos show two basic methods of closing a wound with stitches: continuous stitches (also called running stitches) and interrupted stitches. My preferred method is continuous stitches. When it isn't possible to use two hands, you can use one hand with crafty finger placement to push the needle through the skin. If it helps, you can draw dots around the wound where you want the thread to go.   Step six: apply an antibiotic ointment  Step seven: cover the wound with gauze and a self-adhering bandage  Avoid getting the wound wet; don’t shower for a couple of days, and don’t swim or bathe until it is fully healed. Clean the wound and reapply an antibiotic ointment at least once daily before covering it with new gauze and self-adhering bandages.   Stitches are usually removed from the face in 3-5 days, from the arms in 5 – 10 days, and from everywhere else in 10 – 14 days. These timelines will vary and you will have to keep an eye one the wound to make a decision as to when is the best time to remove the sutures. To remove the stitches, simply cut the thread in every visible spot, then pull out the thread.  I doubt you would be allowed to give someone stitches as a volunteer, but you can buy practice kits or use meat from the grocery store."
selfharmpics,3d1hlt,ickygooeywomb,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:42:16 2015 UTC,"I've given myself stitches before. Didn't need them, just wanted to try.  I'd just like to tag onto this in case anyone is thinking of doing it themselves:  Make sure whatever thread you use is completely clean and safe. I'd say this is more important than everything else being sterile (which is also very important) because the thread is going to be trapped inside the skin for some time. Also make sure it's strong, not wooly or scrappy. Nice thread will hurt less, and be less likely to leave bits behind like I imagine some could.  Finally, skin is tough. Tougher than you'd think, even with experience such as ours in this subreddit. Be prepared to have to put some effort into it. But equally, don't expect tiny stitches to hold; they need to be a little bit deep to be worth doing.  And of course, stitching yourself up is never advised if you have any other way of dealing with the wound, or access to professional assistance. Please stay safe."

The project is to bring awareness to mental illness, people that are suicidal, depressed, have anxiety, or are just plain unhappy. A semicolon is where an author could have ended a sentence, but chose not to. Anyone who wears one is the author and the sentence is their life."

selfharmpics,3cx152,addicted7,5,Sat Jul 11 15:01:48 2015 UTC,"So for my last cut I made that was pretty deep, I got stitches for a day ago. Usually I don’t get stitches, was my 3rd time getting them, but decided I didn’t really want the months of healing time associated with my wounds.  So I went to my local emergency department at the hospital and spent quite a bit of time waiting to be seen on my own. So many hours later of waiting, a female doctor came to get me. The usual questions were asked first to ensure my “safety” in regards to my mental health. She was very nice about the whole matter, which was really good. Didn’t feel as judged compared to my last 2 times getting stitches. One thing that got to me that made me feel like I didn’t go “deep enough” was when she said it was only a “superficial” cut. I mean, it was gaping open like 3cm wide/10cm long and I hit multiple blood vessels but it was still medically in her terms “superficial”. I don’t know, just made me feel like the cut was inadequate and not enough damage was done to “count” so to speak.  So anyway, she decided to use a sub-cuticular stitch, which is basically using absorbable stitches in the dermal-epidermal layer of the skin instead of stitches that have to be removed later on. She told me that it would prevent scars from the stitches, so I guess that’s a positive. After suturing it, she applied dermabond glue to keep it together.  The picture was taken just before, so just after a day of getting it closed. Parts of the cut are already starting to slightly open back up due to the amount of pressure and tension on the cut. Starting to notice signs of infection too, and to be honest, I’m not that surprised. She never cleaned the wound before closing it and wasn’t sterile in her manner of closing it up. Will probably be going back to see her in 4 days’ time because she wanted me to come back so she could see how it’s healing up.  Honestly, I don’t think stitches are worth the time and energy for me. I don’t know if I’ll ever get them again, don’t really see much point, just cause more hassle. Overall the doctor was really nice but just wasn’t worth the time and effort in my opinion.   Apologies for sharing, just need somewhere to express myself and this is really the only place for that. I hope your all having a somewhat okay day!!"
selfharmpics,3cx152,I_Love_Spiders_AMA,2,Sat Jul 11 15:02:27 2015 UTC,"I'm really glad you got stitches! They might feel irrelevant now, but some day you may look back and be thankful that you got them. Also, remember that getting stitches and treatment greatly reduces the chance of infection.

That's good that it was positive but that's weird she didn't clean it before stitching. If it's already showing signs of infection, I wouldn't wait the 4 days, especially since it's already starting to open again.  It was a lot of time and effort but leaving it open would take much more time and effort and would be much worse in terms of potential infection or the resulting scarring. The wound you had was rather serious and it may not seem like it, but it's really good that you got it closed. I hope you're doing better and that you have a good rest of your day. This is exactly the place for things like this."

In all the years I've spent online and all the fucked up, disgusting shit I've seen, it's different when it's your own. My collection is something I've never shown anyone and even though it's vile, I can't bring myself to throw them away or burn them. I've played with the idea of painting a self portrait on the towel in white but haven't done it yet.  Just before I discovered Reddit and subsequently this sub, I was a regular over at Best Gore. I didn't post much but spent a lot of time lurking. I submitted pictures twice, once of two stomach cuts and a fansign and what I consider my worst, when I dissected out my brachial artery. At the time, I felt very isolated and putting the pictures online for people who would appreciate that sort of thing helped me feel more real. I'm not sure if this requires a warning as the nature of this sub is NSFL but still. This was about 2.5-ish years ago.  Stomach cuts and fansign.  Brachial artery.  One of the fat bottles is from the stomach cuts but I don't rightly know which one. The fansign wasn't deep whatsoever and faded within a few months. There's not even white lines left."

Try not to pick at it and keep it clean and it shouldn't get infected. The body is pretty good at stuff like this on its own, but cleaning and closing it will be doubly safe and minimise scarring. Hope you're alright, OP. Sending good vibes."
selfharmpics,3c79d5,opiesgirl1994,-5,Sun Jul 5 19:22:59 2015 UTC,That is not misinformation. A closed wound heals faster and is less likely to get infected.
selfharmpics,3c79d5,ickygooeywomb,6,Sun Jul 5 21:14:55 2015 UTC,Anyone can close a wound like this with household first aid supplies. You made it sound like it would get infected if op didn't seek professional attention.
selfharmpics,3c79d5,cut_paste_throwaway,-2,Sun Jul 5 21:20:11 2015 UTC,"It's ALWAYS better to get stitches when in doubt, and telling people not to increases chances of infection, which is no joke."
selfharmpics,3c79d5,ickygooeywomb,3,Sun Jul 5 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"I never told anyone not to. It seemed to me that op didn't want to, so I gave advice on dealing with it themselves, which is also very doable and safe. Saying that the only choice is going to a doctor when 1) it isn't, and 2) they probably don't want to, is kind of mean."
selfharmpics,3c79d5,cut_paste_throwaway,0,Sun Jul 5 21:27:43 2015 UTC,I think that your tone was unnecessarily hostile toward someone who was trying to help and that we should always be advocating for real medical attention over home care. Better safe than sorry.

Generally it brings relief to negative emotions, because A) some people may feel that the emotions are ""coming out"" with the blood, B) the pain/wounds may serve as a distraction from the negative emotions, or C) the endorphins released as a result of the injury can become just as addictive as any drug (the use of which is no better than self-harm).

I know you're feeling hurt, upset and abandoned right now, but cutting in this state, while waiting for someone else to do something, is going to get you nowhere. Write her a letter instead. Pour out your heart. Explain what is going on, how you are feeling, and why you are feeling that. After you've done that, and you've calmed down somewhat, try and call her if you think she'll take your call. If not, find something else that you can do to calm yourself, so that when you do finally get in contact, you can have a calm, rational discussion. You're gonna be okay."

selfharmpics,3bpz4d,saladdressed,3,Wed Jul 1 05:52:58 2015 UTC,"How was inpatient? Did it help at all? I was hospitalized 12 years ago for cutting and it was shitty; nurses who clearly resented all the patients in the psych ward, doctors who barely saw me and just wrote ""suicide attempt"" in my chart despite the fact that I had no intention to die. Do they have treatment options for cutting now?"
selfharmpics,3bpz4d,I_Love_Spiders_AMA,2,Wed Jul 1 21:12:33 2015 UTC,"inpatient has never helped, sadly. I don't really want help and they still send me involuntarily. 85% of the nurses/doctors I've met in mental hospitals have been very rude and outright mean, to the extent I've been told to kill myself multiple times from the professionals suppose to be helping me. as far as treatment options I'm not sure if you're talking about medicine/therapy or what they do to help while in there so I'll address both. I have BPD so they just lump self-harm and BPD together so they just ask me to do therapy and put me on antipsychotic/anti-depressants and while I'm in there they just put me in the at-risk/suicidal part of the hospitals so there's cameras in my room, bathroom is locked and I'm not allowed to wear casual clothes just a gown. I eat in my room and not allowed anything other than a plastic spoon."
selfharmpics,3borai,nameless33395,5,Tue Jun 30 22:37:48 2015 UTC,Those strips aren't needed for your circumstance; it will not minimise scaring and if it's any consolation those will not scar badly if at all.

Like repeatedly cutting in the same area- you do it once, whatever. Do it again, and the skin has already begun a trauma response, so the response is bigger for the second one. Like my skin wasn't sure if I was finished hurting it so it wasn't going to put in a whole lot of effort healing if it was just going to have to do it all over again.  The ones on my arm with the greater trauma response have actually scarred worse, and still hurt a lot, even though I'm nearly 6 weeks clean.

Normally this doesn't bother me - but it's been getting gradually more purple, and spreading further from the edges - the wound is 30 days old now (a similar wound (that I cut at the same time) on a different part of my body is shown in the images as well, it was deeper and it has healed to a scar now).   I guess that combination of things is causing concern for me - I don't want my skin to die around the wound. Should I get this checked? Or do you think it's just a stubborn cut that is really struggling to heal?"
selfharmpics,3axi6s,OneEyedOneHorned,2,Wed Jun 24 08:10:18 2015 UTC,"The first one looks really irritated and is struggling to really start healing. I would clean it out really well, disinfect it, and then wrap it with gauze and antibiotic ointment. It's not healed enough internally to start hardening. You can put a cold cloth on it (or a well-wrapped ice pack) and keep it on for short periods of time to help with the irritation.  None of them look like they're dying, at least to me. I haven't looked at any selfharm pics in a while now so I didn't see if you posted these when you did them but they look stressed more than anything else. If they're especially painful or if your whole...I'm not sure if these are legs or what but if your body part is achy and you feel physically kinda shitty or they change in any negative way (like the irritation spreading), I'd get them looked at. I think they're being stubborn. The lower two look in better shape and like they'll be healed soon. I hope you're doing ok."

I don't want to be one of those guys who are like ""Oh yea, why don't you just quit?"" because I know how hard it is to quit. However, I don't want you to die because you're not eating enough. So I don't know what to say other than that, but just take it how you will, and do what you can, every little bit helps."

I just got out in February and barely held it together until now. I've been much thinner and much heavier than in this picture, but I've learned it really doesn't matter because it's never actually about my weight, because no matter what weigh I am always going to try to push the boundaries a little further. At this time I feel pretty ambivalent towards death... I would be okay with dying, but I'm not going to actively seek him out. I don't necessarily want to die from this, but I wouldn't protest if I did, it's already taken so much from me. For now I'm just going to keep with my graduate studies and see what happens... maybe things will work out somehow... Sorry for the novel and tangents"

His response was ""I wouldn't jump out in front of a moving bus, but if I were about to be hit by one, I wouldnt have the strength to move out of the way."" I don't think you should sit back and see how things turn out, I think you should take matters into your own hands and do what will make you the most happy."

A strange convergence of unlikely probabilities that allowed me to be found and resuscitated. Since then, I never really think ""I want to kill myself,"" it's more like... ""Oh well, I wish it would have worked that time I tried, but it didn't so here we are.""  Also, I don't mean to sound unmotivated... It's more like I put in my best effort, but I don't get my hopes up about things I want anymore. Perfectionism is a huge component of my issues. I work extremely hard, as an aero student,  no way I could have made it through without spending every waking moment of my college life on it. It's bizarre because I have the groundwork in my life laid out perfectly to realistically pave the way to my dream life... But it is hard to imagine it actually working out in the end. It's like I can't allow myself to hope for the best because I'll just be more disappointed. Even though good things do work out, I still can't allow myself any hope."

You could try covering it up with some sort of makeup. I think some people put foundation on scars to try and hide them. Failing that the next thing I would suggest is to come up with a good excuse.

selfharmpics,3avbwu,amanderp699,2,Wed Jun 24 03:18:11 2015 UTC,Your best bet is probably makeup. Green eyeshadow (without any glitter/sparkle) will neutralize any red tone on your skin.

Now of course there's the extreme of slicing completely through an artery and then you're equally as fucked as a horizontal sever.

selfharmpics,3abxu5,FoxDown,3,Thu Jun 18 21:22:17 2015 UTC,"If you want tips on how to fix that hole, you can pm me. The ""proper"" way would be to use a sawzall to make it bigger all the way to the joists and halfway over them, maybe put a plank behind diagonally for extra support, then put in a cut piece of sheetrock/drywall. Then apply compound, sand it, and use the matching paint if you have it.    But I think you may be able to get away with just applying compound in the hole over a few applications to gradually close it up, ie, applying what you can before it starts to goop down, then letting it dry so you can apply more until it's closed. And make sure to use a home depot type spatula to apply compound in a level way. Made the mistake of not using one and I pretty much had to rebreak it and start over. And use a hand sander that sort of moves like a clothes iron, as just sandpaper won't work well. It may take a few applications and sandings, but it'll look okay with a bit of effort."

selfharmpics,3acg8e,jecniencikn,0,Fri Jun 19 10:55:58 2015 UTC,If you properly dress and take care of wounds and tools there should be nothing to worry about as to viruses and illnesses. If skin works as a good protective shield then bandages or plaster will increase your safety even more. And scabs aren't open wounds so it should be alright.

The initial pain made me keep my arm bent to stop it hurting and as the wound healed and eventually scarred the scar was formed with my arm bent and has left me unable to straighten. I've had some physio and a steroid injection four weeks ago (2nd due tomorrow) and I had another physio assessment today. I now have to wear this splint of a night to try and help straighten my arm. I need to go back weekly and they will reshape the splint and straighten it slightly each week. The physio and occupational therapist are hopeful I will get most of the movement back but said it will never go back to the way it was before.  Sorry this is so long but I just wanted to explain things a bit. Out of the thousands of cuts I have done over the last 20 years I have never had one that has led to this much recovery time and I can tell you now - it really wasn't worth it! :-/

I sympathise with you, cutting your inner elbow is truly a bad idea. That's the thing, all it's takes is that one cut to cause a lot of damage and hinder your recovery.

selfharmpics,3a4wne,gullibeans,1 point,Thu Jun 18 19:29:25 2015 UTC,"when they're only that deep, i don't think you should worry about stopping the bleeding too much. i would keep it still, let it do it's thing, clean up anything that's dripping and dab off the extra scabs afterwards with some clean water, once it's all dried.  it's A LOT easier, makes it a lot less sore afterwards and i've found that it also helps them scab properly. i used to do what you're doing and the scabs would always be uneven and break really easily, which sucks because then it bleeds a bit and probably raises the chances of it getting infected.  also, if you're worried about how much it's bleeding, i think that not overlapping them could help. i've found that overlapped ones sometimes heal funny, tend to bleed more and are more likely to reopen once they've scabbed.  FYI this is all anecdotal, but my cuts looked the same as yours at one point and my doctor agreed with the above, so it can't be that wrong, i don't think. just stay safe x"
selfharmpics,3a4wne,gullibeans,2,Wed Jun 17 12:43:33 2015 UTC,"The problem wasn't how much it was bleeding, I've just never bled this much. It's the first time I've seen it soak though gauze and tissues. And I do overlap them; I like the way it looks, but I'll try not to."
selfharmpics,3a4wne,dmyerty,2,Wed Jun 17 18:37:35 2015 UTC,"while it shouldn't be bleeding at all, it's ""okay"" if it's bleeding through gauzes/tissues a little bit. like, that's not too much blood, if you get what i mean? especially if you're putting them on straight after.  and i don't think that you should put any dressings or gauzes on it. i've always been told by doctors that, when it's only the first few layers of skin, you should let the air get to it and let it heal naturally.  i can't remember why but covering up grazes like that apparently makes them more prone to infection. i know that my mom grazed her elbow when she was little, her dad put a bandage around of it (in spite of grandma telling him not to) and it went all septic and gross. she had to go to a doctor and they were very adamant about not putting gauzes on stuff like this."

selfharmpics,38n874,MathieuFunction,1 point,Fri Jun 5 18:27:58 2015 UTC,"Well it helps them heal faster and makes them itch less. Plus if they scar open you just get a weird block of scar tissue in your skin. Which also start to itch later. -.- So I tape it with some medical tape (?) so the scar stays smaller, everything itches less and heals faster. I can only advice it, but you need to figure out how to close it best, as that doesn't always work."

The bandaids coupled with the elastic bandage should provide enough tension on the skin to draw it together. Try to leave it for at least a day before you look at it again. If you start poking around before it's ready, it will open again, as the connective fibres knitting the skin together won't have had a chance to fully form yet."

selfharmpics,389uqw,knocksondoors,3,Tue Jun 2 20:50:23 2015 UTC,Do you have anything to close this with? The only way I have managed to not do deep cuts recently is to switch to minor burns. I'm not suggesting you do that at all but if you are trying to lessen the damage maybe think about switching your method of self-injury. Hope you're ok <3
selfharmpics,389uqw,asherd87,3,Tue Jun 2 21:06:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I do, I will close it with steri strips...I have been burning too, recently.  Thinking about going back to smoking,  HA!  Been quit for 5 years but the anxiety triggering cuts seem to be the worst for me.  I do cut for a multitude of reasons but when I'm having a panic attack they are the most severe.  So perhaps just knowing that's when they are worst can help me avoid it being so bad.  So I guess explaining all that to you has helped me, so thank you!!!"
selfharmpics,389uqw,asherd87,2,Tue Jun 2 21:28:29 2015 UTC,"The last couple of years cutting has been my more severe form of hurting myself. If I choose to do one of the many others I get the pain I need but the damage is minimal. A scar on my inner elbow has prevented me from straightening my arm for around 3 months now and a combination of physio and steroid injections and the possibility of a cast / splint or surgery is what it's taking to attempt to get full movement back. Out of the thousands of cuts I have done over the last (nearly) 20 years, this one has caused me the most problems and recovery time. It hardly seems worth it yet I still need to hurt myself. I can currently manage to keep the damage limited and I hope you can work on that too. It's good you can recognise when it is more severe for you - maybe that can help you. I am glad talking to me has helped too. Pm me if you ever need to talk or rant or whatever <3"
selfharmpics,389uqw,p34chyk33n,2,Tue Jun 2 21:52:27 2015 UTC,"Personally, when I was trying to quit cutting I switched to just beating the crap put of my thighs and arms...can hurt a lot (left my hand tingly and weak a few times from hitting nerves I guess) and leaves bruises which can be satisfying but aren't permanent like scars. Also no chance of infection."
selfharmpics,389uqw,Lenaballerina,1 point,Thu Jun 4 03:08:52 2015 UTC,"I too have considered going back to smoking. I'm currently doing a rewards system, where if I don't cut for 4 weeks I get a thing that I want. That seems to be going well. In the meantime to stave off the urges, I spend a lot of time on r/popping and youtube, watching videos of blackhead and cyst extractions. For some reason, that helps to calm me down almost as well as cutting does. I also play with red food colouring a lot-putting it in my hands and letting it dribble down my arms. I've also been doing a lot of colouring in - just googling abstract colouring, and seeing what cool designs I can find. I am also on stress leave from work, which is where a lot of my anxiety comes from, so that is really helping too. Currently 19 days clean. Hopefully that gives you a few ideas to try.  Be safe, and get that wound clean, closed and covered- especially if you're not going to get it looked at. xxoo"

selfharmpics,37xff4,Leopardfire,2,Sun May 31 05:07:32 2015 UTC,"Ok so a little over two weeks ago I burned myself for the first time.  I used a curling iron and held it to my hip in two places.  When I removed it, the skin directly beneath was grayish and leathery and felt nothing but the skin around it blistered and was painful.  Since then it has scabbed over and the scabs pealed leaving the gross yellowy stuff beneath.  However, this has not been healing and it still hurts to press on it so I'm starting to worry.  I've been putting antibacterial cream on it every night, but it hasn't been healing.  What should I do?"
selfharmpics,37xff4,tifubytypingtify,2,Sun May 31 05:09:49 2015 UTC,You should go to a doctor/ER. Immediately!
selfharmpics,37xff4,tifubytypingtify,2,Sun May 31 05:42:17 2015 UTC,Is there any other way? I'm a teenager so there's no way I can go to a doctor without my parents knowing so is there anything else I can do.  I'm kind of scared it's a 3rd degree burn and it hurts when I move that part of my body and it's not healing fast at all so it's kind of becoming a big problem.  Do you really think a doctor is necessary?
selfharmpics,37xff4,HofmannsTrippyPony,2,Sun May 31 05:54:00 2015 UTC,Where do you live? Your doctor might have to keep his mouth shut according to law.   Healing time: Prolonged (months) and incomplete   Source

selfharmpics,37xff4,notsoinsane,2,Sun May 31 06:58:49 2015 UTC,"This looks like a third/forth degree burn and could take quite a few months to heal. As an EMT, my most honest advice is you need medical attention. Burns have very high risk of infection. If you absolutely cannot see a doctor please disinfect it regularly with rubbing alcohol and keep it covered with sterile dressings."

I'm still struggling and won't go into detail for legal safety reasons but I can tell you if you or someone reaches out you can have the ability to get help and start recovery-even if you relapse, A LOT. If you have an Eating disorder(like me) a good place to go(I'm going to be going there in the very near future) is the Emily program-they have multiple different services to choose from and they go by a pace they'd comfortable for you so I do suggest it. If your in school like me, I highly suggest talking with a counselor and/or maybe even in a counseling group(if they provide one for a certain thing such as ""family change"").

selfharmpics,379y4o,jecniencikn,1 point,Tue May 26 15:22:46 2015 UTC,Making it private would prevent drive by trolls and downvoters without stopping anyone from posting here.  It would be better than the current system - which probably violates Reddit rules about not breaking the site.
selfharmpics,379y4o,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Tue May 26 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"I understand how going to being a private sub would be better but for new users, it would make it more difficult to post when they first find the place and waiting to be allowed it could make it more likely that they'll choose to post elsewhere, which is what this sub is trying to avoid.

selfharmpics,36ujod,Lenaballerina,3,Fri May 22 13:23:20 2015 UTC,"OP, please remember: it's not about depth, the number of cuts or where you cut or how big they are, it's the fact that you cut that is the problem, not how impressive or gross it looks.  This is not a competition.  The only prize you're going to walk away with from this are scars of regret, infections, Anemia and Sepsis.  This is a potentially life threatening mental illness and I really hope that you are not trying to seek approval from us.  Look, it's natural to want to find people that you can relate to, especially when it comes to socially awkward conditions like this, but I am very worried for you, OP.  I want to see you get better, not to hear your disappointment that your recent cuts aren't ""good enough"" for our standards.  I don't know you OP, but I care about you.  Sure, from a glance those probably are not deep enough that will require an ER visit and stitches but it the mere fact that it is occurring is an incredibly serious issue.  If you are not seeing a professional for this: do it!  Do it as soon as you can!  Tomorrow, if possible.  Try and figure out why you are doing this so you can stop.  Tell someone you're doing it if you haven't already."

selfharmpics,36n7c0,asherd87,7,Wed May 20 16:46:39 2015 UTC,It's been almost 3 months since I could straighten my left arm after a cut on my inner elbow. I started steroid injections today and have to repeat them every 4 weeks for the next few months to try and reduce the scar. I also have a physio assessment next week. My doctor is confident the injections and the physio will allow me to have full movement back in my arm in the next few months :-)
selfharmpics,36n7c0,OneEyedOneHorned,1 point,Wed May 20 16:48:50 2015 UTC,I've never heard of steroid injections for improved mobility but that's awesome they can help!
selfharmpics,36n7c0,FeistyKingKiller,3,Wed May 20 19:47:48 2015 UTC,Thank you! The steroid injections are not directly for mobility but my doctor said the scar is a keloid so surgery wouldn't help as they tend to come back. He's hoping the injections will reduce the size of the scar and flatten it out a bit to give me more movement as the scar has healed with my arm bent. Obviously if this and the physio don't work they will have to consider surgery again but for now it looks like I have managed to avoid it :-) Hope you're well <3

I am really sorry that you felt the need to cut in a -so far- clean area. I don't know how you feel about it but everytime I Made a cut in a New place it always Made it acceptable somehow and soon this New and one forbidden space was covered in scars too.

When I started many years ago, I thought that I would only keep it to one space but your right, it soon spreads when the past space isn't enough.   I woke up today feeling pretty okay but then I felt a dull ache in my right leg and realised the mistake I've made. I don't know, my lower legs were like a sacred ground to me, the only part of me that isn't scarred and didn't have to hide, and now that's destroyed because I couldn't hold back the urges.  Yeah your right, I know they would benefit from stitches, I doubt I will get them though, I seem to heal okay without them, just going to have some bigger scars. Thanks and you take care too!"

selfharmpics,36btny,greatgatsbys,2,Mon May 18 06:34:00 2015 UTC,"Who is they and why don't they think it's a problem?  I would argue that if they are not a medical professional or a mental health professional, they really aren't in a place to make that kind of a judgment call.  Sometimes close family members or friends will say stuff like ""It's not that bad"" because they are either in denial, or because they don't want to freak you out.  Sometimes they are afraid of admitting that it's a big deal because they are afraid of what could happen if you are taken to the emergency room.  Hell, when I first made my mother aware of my self-harming issues, I knew way more about my own rights as a minor regarding the matter then she did as an adult and legal guardian.  I basically had to educate her until she was willing to take me to seek professional help; she was terrified that either she would somehow be arrested for child abuse, or that I would be taken away to a psych ward never to be seen again.  I can think of another instance where a friend of mine was trying to convince me into going off of my medication because he was sure that he knew what was best for me.  He didn't try to get me to stop taking my pills because he hated me, he tried to get me to stop because he genuinely believed that he knew what was best for me and thought that he could help me better then any pill some doctor could shove down my throat.  It wasn't until much later that he started to  understand just how severe some of my underlying issues were, simply because I had developed so many coping mechanisms to help hide those problems.  I don't know man, there's plenty of other reasons why they might have said what they said, but I'm getting the feeling that they don't know what they're talking about if that was their first reaction to finding out you've been self harming.  If you feel like  you have gone to your first or mainline of support and they have let you down, or are actively working against your own recovery, try and reach out to someone else that might be close to you.  Maybe a grandparent or cousin?  Maybe a friend or coworker?  If you are like me and you don't have any of those options available, or feel like they couldn't be trusted for whatever reason, there are also hotlines that might be able to give you some advice on how to proceed without family support.  Link (towards the very bottom, there's a list of numbers)"

selfharmpics,368cwo,asherd87,1 point,Sun May 17 23:40:46 2015 UTC,"I get annoyed when I get them closed because the scars end up smaller than the wound and I feel it somehow minimises what I did. If you don't mind me asking, what did you have surgery for? It was looking like I would need surgery on a scar on my inner elbow - I haven't been able to straighten my arm for over 2 months now - but my doctor is going to try steroid injections into the scar first to see if that helps reduce the scar and improve movement."

selfharmpics,3670bk,nameless33395,2,Sat May 16 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Hello,  First of all, I'm no doctor. Take what I say with a grain of salt.   Bones are actually pretty tough, and it's very difficult to break them by hitting them, unless you're very specific about it. Additionally, when I bruise myself, the area swells up in a similar way to your arm there. In my not-so-professional opinion, you should be fine. However, when in doubt you should always go see a professional.   Best of luck, hope you feel better soon."
selfharmpics,3670bk,cut_paste_throwaway,2,Sat May 16 20:01:16 2015 UTC,"Usually if I get bruises from hitting myself they only appear the day after and they aren't swollen, but I guess maybe I hit myself harder this time and that's why it's swelling. Right after I hit my left arm, my left hand tingled for a few seconds, did that ever happen to you?"
selfharmpics,3670bk,cut_paste_throwaway,2,Sat May 16 20:30:03 2015 UTC,"Yes; deeper tissue damage causes different consequences, as opposed to a more superficial bruise. My smaller bruises show up within a day or two and fade within about a week. The deeper ones swell first, and the bruise itself doesn't show up for a number of days, fading after two or three weeks. I'm not sure about the tingling, but it's possible you hit a nerve, or something (again, not an expert). Please be careful on thinly muscled areas like arms; if I were you I'd move to somewhere with a bit more meat so there's less chance of severe damage."
selfharmpics,3670bk,WastedShadow,2,Sat May 16 21:20:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, that looks very swollen, indeed.! A broken bone would most likely Cause an agonizing pain. Are you able to move your arm freely? Do u feel any instability? I personally don't think that it's broken, because you are still able to type and stuff But you can never be sure, especially if there's nothing but a Photo available. If you're insecure about it I would suggestive seing your GP because of that. Take care!"
selfharmpics,3670bk,WastedShadow,2,Sat May 16 20:02:59 2015 UTC,"I can move my arm freely and I don't feel instability. As long as my arm is fairly relaxed I don't feel any pain, but some movements were I tense my muscels hurt slightly, but really it's not too bad and dosen't bother me and I think sometimes I get a similar feeling from bruises."

Now everything almost always feels like sunshine. So please, if they aren't helping, tell your doc and they will build you up on a new one that hopefully works."
selfharmpics,364aer,Suicidalthoughtsnoto,3,Sat May 16 00:20:50 2015 UTC,"Careful of your spine, and particularly your lower back just above your butt, as this is the area where your organs and delicate areas (particularly the kidneys) are closest to the surface and can be wounded from such activities. Internal bleeding can be a problem, try to stick to the sides of your upper back, and around the ribs (a bonus of being very painful and well protected).   Just because you aren't cutting doesn't mean you can't do serious injury - source; frequent BDSM practitioner.   Otherwise, whatever helps. I've certainly found flogging myself to be a good outlet in the past."
selfharmpics,364aer,Koshechi,1 point,Sat May 16 07:54:22 2015 UTC,Do you have any more tipps on how to avoid serious injury?
selfharmpics,364aer,nameless33395,1 point,Sat May 16 12:45:21 2015 UTC,"The thighs are probably the safest place, although I'm not sure how well the angle would work... Otherwise I'm not sure how much I know that is relevant to self flagellation...  Using rigid implements on the back and ribs is dangerous because you can chip and damage bone, but rigid toys don't work very well on yourself. Keeping control of your implement and avoiding ""wrapping"" where the belt or flogger wraps around to the front and sides of your body is important, both because the toy tends to gain a bit of force with the movement and because it can reach more vital organs. Better off to use a shorter implement than a long one, and most people into BDSM practice quite a bit on pillows and stuff to get their aim down first... so yeah.  I would recommend using rope over a belt because ropes can't cut the skin as easily - its surprisingly possible to the sharper edges of a belt to cut through the skin. Add a few knots if thats not heavy enough for you.   Belts a pretty hard core, my record is only 20 strokes although I'm not /that/ into pain. I would start with rope if you were going to try anything."

selfharmpics,364aer,Koshechi,1 point,Sun May 17 02:31:54 2015 UTC,"You can definitely reach the backs of the thighs/ass more easily than the front of your thighs on yourself, although the angle is still a bit more awkward than the back. You're right though, much safer."

selfharmpics,3601zy,knocksondoors,3,Thu May 14 23:15:55 2015 UTC,"Really fresh cuts do look bad when first done, especially when you can see the fat.

It's a tough fight because sometimes I know I need medical attention but, to me, I feel like it's defeating the object and I know I will be annoyed when it heals 'well.  I want it to look as bad as it felt to do it, I want that reminder so it feels justified. I guess I also want the reminder to keep myself in check - 'this is how bad it has been and you need to do what you can to keep it 'safe' so other people don't have to know' It's good to know when someone else out there really understands what it's like and the struggle between rationally knowing something yet feeling the complete opposite.

selfharmpics,35wejz,BPDisOP,7,Thu May 14 01:53:07 2015 UTC,"I've started cutting deeper, cutting longer. More often. In more areas. I don't know if this is due to my current episode, or if I'm truly losing touch with myself. I don't want this to escalate any further.  I am posting today (even though I did leave this subreddit due to being triggered by a video) because I'm afraid. I'm afraid the next time I self harm it wont be enough, and I'll have to go deeper again. It's all I think about. It doesn't look bad at all. I feel like it's still so small. And I know I can go as far as I like because I literally cannot feel a thing. Not even the first cut brings pain. I think I should put myself in... go into inpatient for a week or so. But will it help? I'll always know what I am capable of now. I'll always want to keep going deeper and longer. I can't be put away forever to protect myself from myself.   I'm going to talk to my group therapist today (she works the wards for inpatient as well) and ask her advice. I know those rooms are for people who really need it, desperate cases - in episodes of high. Not low. IDK. Just needed to vent. I know I could have vented in r/selfharm but I didn't want to trigger someone, and I suppose I wanted to post pictures so I can see the difference. And post to a group of people I know."

If you think inpatient would help I really would recommend it. There's help groups and art therapy etc at most of the hospitals I've been to (although I've never attended any). The only thing I'd say to be weary of (at least this was true for my case) is, when you're in there, you really think about whatever is going on your life non-stop. I was having really rough relationship issues when I was in and out of them and I think being in there did me more harm than good because I'd just sit for weeks and think about it non-stop. I do hope you feel better soon though and hope your appointment with your therapist goes well."

I'm in a similar position actually, watching my cuts get deeper, and feeling out of control. One thing that is helping me a little bit is I give myself a time limit, and when that's up, I have to stop. Another thing I'm going to try that my counsellor suggested today is that before I cut, I have to write for ten minutes. Just about anything. So I'm going to give that a go.  Good luck.

I often write my day analysis - like the lead up to the self harm - what I tried to avoid it, etc. Then how I feel about it. My therapist likes it, helps her see where I was that night.   Thank you.

In my experience, all inpatient units have a main unit for low dependency patients, then an ICA or HDU (intensive care/high dependency) area for the more ""high risk"" patients.

selfharmpics,35ovk3,Shadow_Wanderer,1 point,Tue May 12 09:00:22 2015 UTC,Do they work well on wounds that large though? I've always thought they just worked on minor cuts.
selfharmpics,35ovk3,Shadow_Wanderer,1 point,Sat May 16 14:38:53 2015 UTC,"Yep, my doctor just uses the really long steri strips and pulls the edges together, then covers it with a waterproof dressing and a tight bandage. If it was a bit longer she might've had to put stitches in, it just depends how deep the cut is. And they usually heal pretty nicely."

selfharmpics,35jdck,ghost-vibes,1 point,Mon May 11 13:33:39 2015 UTC,Did you go over it multiple times or manage it in one go? Because I usually have to go over more than once for something substantially deep but I know some people who can do it with one.

selfharmpics,35ag6l,stickfiguredrawings,1 point,Fri May 8 22:11:49 2015 UTC,Was the purpose to hurt yourself more or just desinfect the wounds? On my hand sanitizer it says you shouldn't use it near open wounds do you know why that is? Are there any dangers (besides the stining) if you do that? Is using hand sanitizer better than not desinfecting the wounds at all?
selfharmpics,35ag6l,nameless33395,3,Fri May 8 22:16:41 2015 UTC,Is it bad that I'm not worried? (thank you for the warning though)
selfharmpics,35ag6l,Valhalant,1 point,Sat May 9 04:10:58 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what the reason for not using hand sanitizer to clean wounds is but if it says not to then I would definitely follow that. In general the best way is to just use water. There's also wipes made specifically for cleaning cuts-they aren't always necessary but they're better than using soap.
selfharmpics,35ag6l,nameless33395,1 point,Fri May 8 23:45:29 2015 UTC,What about using cotton pads with desinfecting alcohol from the pharmarcie?
selfharmpics,35ag6l,Valhalant,1 point,Fri May 8 23:50:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not a medical expert in any way so all I can really say is to just follow the instructions on it, if it says it's suitable for cleaning cuts then go for it, otherwise I wouldn't. You could also ask staff at the pharmacy for their advice on what the best thing to use is. Again I always just use water and sometimes that's all you need."
selfharmpics,35ag6l,nameless33395,2,Sat May 9 19:15:22 2015 UTC,"Jup I also just use water because it don't really have anything else, and if it's a little bit deeper or takes a little while to form a scab I but a plaster over it."

I give my all to anybody who asks. I give everything that I am, I am always there for people. I go out of my way. And I've got nothing to show for it. Nobody ever returns the favor. I don't remember the last time somebody did something nice for me. I can count on one hand how many people actually care about me and would be affected by my death. But I'm so tired. I try to find it in me to go on, but there's just nothing left anymore.  Suicide has weighed so heavily on my mind recently. It's the only solution I haven't tried (at least whole heartedly). I'm not living. I just exist. Solely for the fact that my immediate family and a few friends would be hurt to see me go. When I feel the urge to leave this world, I think of my niece. I think of how she wouldn't understand what happened and how she'd miss me. Maybe you can think of your girlfriend and try to find the will to live.  Anyway, my point is that /r/suicidewatch is a good place to go if you aren't willing to call a hotline or reach out to someone. I posted there recently and the people there genuinely care and want to help you. It's amazing to see that complete strangers care enough to do that. There are good people in this world. I used a throwaway and you can do that if you don't want somebody to know who you are. Nobody can stop you, but we will try to help you as best we can. Please just think about these things.

The white is pretty normal as it's healing from the inside first, it's white blood cells and collagen. If it's not inflamed or painful, the clear is probably serous fluid. Sometimes cuts don't scab because it's too wet for the top to dry. Keep it covered and clean, just don't scrub it as you'll pull away the healing tissue.
