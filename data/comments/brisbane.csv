brisbane,3e0bo5,The_other_lurker,11,Tue Jul 21 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"Any job that is advertised is going to be fought so fiercely over that it's simply not even worth applying for.  Your best bet, and this is the way it has ALWAYS been, is to do the foot work yourself, lay foundations.  You've got to make your personality, and your tenacious drive be the selling point.  I was only between jobs twice in my life, but both times, it was the never ending foundation laying that ensured a job.  Here's what I recommend:   dress for where you want to work, so when you walk in, it already looks like you work there CHOOSE where you want to work, and if they don't have a spot for you, keep going back until you know every person who works there by name, and are friends with every one of them. When you finally get an interview, you can say you're friends with the bar manager, the hostess, the waiter, the chef, and the food runner, etc. Don't spend mountains of time asking for applications and crap like that. CUT TO THE CHASE; go up to the hostess/waiter when she's not busy and ask her when the manager is usually free. Wait till then. Go back, and roll right up to the front of house manager and shake his/her hand, introduce yourself and ask if they need a good waiter/bartender/whatever. You need to have confidence in yourself, and sell it, don't be passive and just sit around and write out a bunch of bullshit. Applications have a shelf life of 5 minutes. If you fill it out, there's a good chance the eyes who need to see it will never see it. Finish hard. If the manager is outright negative on prospect, don't be deterred - take it from Dale Carnegie (How to win friends and influence people), take the onus and responsibility: ""No worries mate, I'm happy to hear you're fully staffed right now, that only makes me want to get on board more! I'll check back with you in two week and see how things are looking, maybe this summer will bring some increased business.""   Now you've finished the convo, you've given the manager something solid to think about, and you've put the onus on yourself to follow up. The manager doesn't even need to think about anything, except that, next time you see him, 2 weeks later, he'll remember that you 1. smiled, 2. were confident, 3. sold yourself, 4. were upbeat about business prospects 5. had stability and sales on the mind, and 6. goddamn you followed up when you said you would.  If he doesn't hire you on the spot, he's got nothing to lose by trying to find something part time for you.  The bottom line, if sell yourself like a champ, there's work in every single door you step through."

For more stuff like this that seems obvious once you learn it, but you might not think of it yourself, I really recommend the book ""What color is your parachute"". It has a website here which might have some freebie information.  Half of the book is a kind of personality quiz to help you figure out what kind of job you should do, which I skipped, but the other half is just solid advice on how to get hired - and it does not involve applying to advertised vacancies."
brisbane,3e0bo5,mjswooper,4,Tue Jul 21 05:16:25 2015 UTC,"Depends on the job.   For example, hospitality: contacts and resume drops, IT: seek.com.au, etc.  I'd probably stay away from gumtree."

brisbane,3e0bo5,dannaz423,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:10:33 2015 UTC,Yeah use seek to look for vacancies then give them a call. Don't say you saw it on seek because they will probably just tell you to apply on there rather than having to deal with you. This will greatly increase your chance of getting to the interview stage.

My folks had the 3 of us kids there the same year (grade 8, 10, and 12) and they swear it almost sent them broke!  It was horrendous back then, so can only imagine what it's like now.    But then with a boutique school (in so much as they have limited numbers) that offers fantastic extra curricular and intra curriculum events, you expect to pay.    I know that they have a group of Grade 10's at the moment that are doing a trip around Europe for Geography.  That's a pretty impressive field trip if you ask me!"

Right now if you're coming from overseas and are looking to gamble, who would choose Brisbane when you have Sydney and Melbourne?"

I mean, it's something and I am clearly no expert - but how much money will it actually keep in Australia?"
brisbane,3dx860,samsquanch2000,12,Mon Jul 20 20:14:38 2015 UTC,"Other than the bare minimum wages they are paying most of the staff, I'd say probably not as much money as we think."
brisbane,3dx860,apaniyam,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:07:12 2015 UTC,"The big money won't, was never going to. The wages paid to staff, the support organisations, the marketing contracts, the consumer goods etc that the Casino requires will be though. Brisbane is a fairly boring place to come on holiday, it's more a launch pad to the north, or a day's break on the way south to nsw's tourist pulls or Melbourne."
brisbane,3dx860,youshouldreadthem,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:30:22 2015 UTC,"jobs for workers  Firstly, the casino includes several hotels. I'm not sure if they'll be aussie run or not, but they will be staffed by locals, who will get paid with the money of foreign gamblers. These staff will go spend this money in aussie stores.  The gamblers themselves will go spend their money out in town in Businesses owned by locals and staffed bt locals  When you spend money in a foreign owned local business, the profits (after tax?) will go overseas, but surely only a tiny bit of the revenue becomes pure profits- the rest is Australian expenses  Imagine a gambler eats in a restaurant owned internationally- the cost of their meal pays for the aussie waiters, the aussie chefs and the aussie managers. The restaurant has to pay rent to an aussie and has the plumbing done by an aussie. the restaurant buys aussie fruit, vegies and meat. the power bill goes to an Aussie company, which hires aussies.  probably out of their $1000 meal, 200 is profits. that's taxed at 30% ($60) and the remaining $140 goes overseas"

You can promise a few jobs and do whatever you want? It looks like it is easy to buy the morals of Brisbane residents. Brisbane is basically signalling itself as a corrupt shithole to the rest of the world. It will continue to attract those types of people.

brisbane,3dx860,Kalanski,2,Mon Jul 20 09:53:04 2015 UTC,wut?
brisbane,3dx860,tiredgrad,13,Mon Jul 20 11:54:23 2015 UTC,If Crown was awarded the additional gaming licence then there would be 2 casinos in Brisbane. Because Echo has secured the new development they will just be moving to the new building and making the current casino a shopping complex. That way there's still only 1 casino in Brisbane.
brisbane,3dx860,Kalanski,3,Mon Jul 20 12:10:14 2015 UTC,"If thats so, then its still bad for consumers no?"
brisbane,3dx860,Sugarless_Chunk,6,Mon Jul 20 12:20:02 2015 UTC,There are pros and cons to both scenarios; I don't think Brisbane could support having two casinos but I also think that it would be good to have some competition.
brisbane,3dx860,youshouldreadthem,3,Mon Jul 20 12:24:17 2015 UTC,"There is nothing wrong with a company that has a monopoly on printing money being given a licence to print money.  In manila there is approx 16 Casinos running. Brisbane has 1, it's run down and lacks staff due to treating them poorly and constantly cutting hours. They have run Jupiters into the ground over the last 5 years.   It's really a shame, and having a second casino to create competition would've been a good thing."
brisbane,3dx860,vidman33,2,Mon Jul 20 13:02:49 2015 UTC,"Manila has 10 million people in its metro region, and is the capital and primary point of entry for a country of nearly 100m people.  I don't know that Brisbane to Manila is a fair comparison."

When's the last time you went to a bar, restaurant, arcade, clothes shop, movies, sports match and left with money money than you came inb with? Never? Because businesses work by providing a good or service in return for your  money.  In casinos (just like movies, arcades and  sports events), you receive the service of entertainment and thrill in return for your money"
brisbane,3dx860,youshouldreadthem,2,Tue Jul 21 02:14:12 2015 UTC,"This is a disastrous decision for consumers. It's insane to had over a monopoly to Echo, given how badly the Treasury is run. And to choose it over the operators of one of the best run casinos in the world is just awful. Yes it looks pretty and will create jobs but imagine for one moment what would happen if we had Crown here competing with Treasury? They would be competing to bring great artists here, give the best promotions etc. None of that will happen now."
brisbane,3dx860,vidman33,4,Mon Jul 20 12:05:37 2015 UTC,"I'm confident that if Crown won the development rights, they wouldn't even need to compete with Echo. The current casino would likely die off due to decreased patronage."
brisbane,3dx860,shitsquatter,3,Mon Jul 20 12:21:41 2015 UTC,"I see your point and it's a fair. What if Crown built the new Casino it might have been a small gap filler in the market to please locals, while not threatening Crown Melb's VIP trade. Now Australia can have 3 world class Resort Casinos."
brisbane,3dx860,hungryb4dinner,2,Mon Jul 20 12:35:50 2015 UTC,create jobs   The govt has no reason to care about a nice fun casino for you to play in.

brisbane,3dx860,Kalanski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:32:00 2015 UTC,most of the public space either north or south is going to be in shade. Even in a hot climate that's not a good thing.  It's nice to sit in the sun or move to a shady part under a tree but perma shade sucks
brisbane,3dx860,vidman33,0,Tue Jul 21 10:56:51 2015 UTC,"Very disappointed. From an economical view it might be the best decision but Echo runs a very poor casino. Crown has time and time again proven they know how to smash the competition(not exactly true) but they do very well.  Echo has phased out any and all perks over the years and kept all progress almost completely halted.   Management decisions are slow and indecisive with no comps ever existing, service to anyone with less than a Black card is a myth.  I was really looking forward to hopefully Crown getting the bid. Such a shame, to me at least."
brisbane,3dx860,Kalanski,2,Mon Jul 20 11:23:09 2015 UTC,Consumers lose at Casino.
brisbane,3dx860,vidman33,2,Mon Jul 20 11:53:41 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate on what you mean at all
brisbane,3dx860,Kalanski,4,Mon Jul 20 12:14:05 2015 UTC,"Well I could but I think you pretty much nailed in the OP. Take the poker room as an example. It used to have 12 tables, most of which were full on a Saturday night. They have the monopoly on the product and now they usually have 3-4 tables up, and no decent tournaments. To have a monopoly and not be able to grow the industry just shows how great they are. And the Gold Coast is even worse, with waits of several hours to get on a table.   Now contrast to Crown. Crown has established itself as the home of poker in Australia. Last time I went there would be 100+ tables (?), more than i can count anyway. Has regular quality tournaments and one of the top five tournaments in the world. All this with only double the population.   Now extrapolating that to Brisbane's situation. We could have had two competing casinos, one of which is one of the worlds best for poker. There would be pressure on Rake, competition for the best dealers, most comfortable chairs, rewards programs, comps, shorter waiting lists etc. Now with this decison non of that will happen.   Consumers lose. Sadly we are just an afterthought and will continue to be."

I'm down in Sydney for work at the moment, and it is hard to think that Brisbane is Australia's 3rd largest city.  Brissy is just so much more relaxed and chilled out.  Like sure we don't have some fancy Opera house, or a harbour.  But we have the Tivoli, and a nice bridge.  The big city folk just don't get our wee town.  So I'd tell them to hang around for another couple of years, have a XXXX, sit out on their veranda, in their squaters chair, during a thunder storm, with the cricket or footy on the radio, and a snag on the bbq.  Chill out a little, and realise Brissy isn't a holiday 100% party times, Bankys on every corner, super restaurants everywhere, world city, or financial/shopping hub.  It's just a pretty darn good place to live most of the year.  Was a little chilly on Friday night though.  I had to put the heater on for 30mins."

As for cultural backwater, depends what you compare it to - for me, I grew up in Coffs, and lived on the Sunny Coast for 6 years, so having access to things like GOMA, gigs and events is much more than I'm used to. I can see how people coming from bigger, busier cities would feel bereft of entertainment/culture.   But there are negatives to living everywhere. Sydney has nice beaches but some very arrogant people. Melbourne is great and very vibrant, but shitty weather and hipsters.

brisbane,3dxkq2,Bdi89,4,Mon Jul 20 11:01:01 2015 UTC,"(bad infrastructure, crazy drivers, high price of public transport etc).   You get crazy drivers everywhere you go but the bad infrastructure ,the high cost of PT and rather weak PT relative to the cost really set us back.   I love the Busway but its only good if you live in the south, nowadays you can hardly get good parking to just use the busway like Garden City, ANZ Stadium and 8 Mile Plains. When you add up the cost and its more or less cheaper to just drive because the amount of time you spend getting there and petrol probably adds up equivalent to park at the BCC for $15 a day.   This is almost true if you have to use train to work, where I live I rather spend 20 bucks or something for a Early Bird spot than to take a 1hr+ train and another 20 min walk to work."

I even feel the Busway isn't future proof, it was good when it was commissioned but it reach operational capacity pretty quickly especially when you see 6+ bus all trying to get out of the red lights around the Cultural Center stop or waiting for the bus to drop their passenger while sitting in green light at the tunnel turn off for example."

Brisbane is for anyone arriving from any European or North American city, a backwater. Asians from 3rd world countries love it because compared to any Asian city, it's clean compared to their own polluted cities, and they even have their own university here: Griffith. It is far from anywhere, doesn't have ordinary amenities that most small cities of 250 000 people would have there (Eu and NA), and is full of 1. public servants and 2. guys with utes. That's it. It's an administrative centre for Queensland a long way from the beaches and the biggest private industry in Brisbane is probably a sandwich takeaway somewhere in the Wintergarden.   The planning really is terrible. Traffic is bad. Prices are way too high for rents and homes. People are rude. Fights everywhere. Students being murdered. People killing each other. Drug use rampant. Drunks everywhere. ""But hey, we had the Saints!""   Most people in Brisbane would actually prefer to listen to ACDC even though we did have the Saints, Custard, Go Betweens which really sums up the city of Brisbane.

I don't need to be stimulated by fantastic architecture, planning and cultural delights that I can't walk down the road 2 feet without nursing a raging erection.  Like most of you, live in Brisbane because it's the product of outside influences (You moved out of home and your parents live in Brisbane, work, etc).  Anyway, what sort of egg headed dipshit uses that as a talking point.  Them: Oh that's cool, what part of Australia do you live in.  Me: Queensland, Brisbane  Them: Man that place is kind of a dump, it's nothing like Melbourne.  (fucking yawn)"
brisbane,3dxkq2,IHazMagics,0,Mon Jul 20 22:56:48 2015 UTC,"Shithole: They don't know what they're talking about, I'd probably just laugh. Because Brisbane's boom was so recent much of the infrastructure and CBD buildings are actually quite new and well maintained. There are no inner-city areas that are deeply unsafe and while you may have to drive to some or have to pay (stupid rates) for parking at others, this city has most amenities.    Cultural backwater: It's not New York City, but it doesn't have the population to be. There's a good live music scene and the major galleries are not only quite good but free. It gets many/most of the big shows that Sydney and Melbourne does.   What it does lack is the wide range of small shows (theatre, art, comedy, dance) that you get in culturally rich cities, and a single place with listings for what there is.  The population (due to demographics and culture) of Brisbane favour traditional formats of entertainment. There aren't a lot of people making their own performance art, and there isn't a large enough dedicated group of people who would always go to such a show.   Basically, there aren't enough hipsters and artsy people. Promoting alternative culture is the thing hipsters are actually good for."

I was genuinely interested.  This property is almost exactly what my friend is looking for except the price is probably a bit too high.  Every single real estate ad has pictures.

brisbane,3dtum4,poopymcfuckoff,6,Sun Jul 19 14:17:15 2015 UTC,"As /u/poopymcfuckoff said $300/wk is VERY CHEAP for house (especially if it is within walking/cycling distance to Herston). I share a two bedroom apartment with someone in Auchenflower for $280/wk. So on this front, you're doing very well /u/Chaleoz  I can't speak for what expenses keeping a 4yo are as I'm not a parent. $200/wk for everything is a really tight squeeze, I really feel for you. For your transport, ideally avoid both getting a car and using public transport. You want to get this cost as close to $0 as possible. Given the rent price you quoted for your house, I worry that you're located some distance from Herston which means your transport costs will be significant. Fuel costs here can easily exceed $50/wk, and on your budget I picture you buying an older car and I'd hate to see you posting here in a few months time asking for advice on cheap mechanics. If possible, move in closer to town and don't buy a car. For food, avoid prepackaged foods and be prepared to eat less meat. For communication, TPGs $29/month ADSL plus TPGs $19/month is probably your best economy deal. Other costs, namely family entertainment, hit websites like the Weekend Edition (or frequent us here on Reddit) to find out whats going on for free.  Godspeed  Edit: I should also add that I'm also a PhD student living on the $25.8k per annum APA. In my school we have opportunities to teach and as /u/loggerheader mentioned, it is about $50/hour (give or take, depends what you're doing)."
brisbane,3dtum4,justcameheretosay_,4,Mon Jul 20 01:50:45 2015 UTC,Try to buy your fruit and vegetable at a market or fruit shop- Woolworths or Coles will charge way more. Freeze meats when on sale. Use lentils and extra vegetables so you can use less meat in meals. Apply for support or scholarships through the uni (Is there an equity group for support at uq?).  Ask at the student centre what financial assistance opportunities they have. They used to discount internet I believe. Good luck!
brisbane,3dtum4,Cnt-rd-ne-mr,3,Sun Jul 19 18:30:55 2015 UTC,"Where about is your rental property located? You can cut a massive amount out of your weekly travel budget by bike commuting to UQ Herston. They have very good bike facilities there. Herston is also relatively close to safe bike paths - however if you live very far away you may have some trouble.   If you can also get something to bring in cash on the weekends - a few hours a week this might help. Also, a lot of PhD students will have the opportunity to tutor undergraduates/postgraduate coursework students and the pay rate for that is very good (I'm told about $50 an hour). Look into that. Presumably you speak Portuguese? :) How about offering tutoring in the language?"

brisbane,3dtum4,taliecat,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:51:33 2015 UTC,"One of my friends is in the same situation, but with a younger child.  He eventually moved far from city to save on rent (this is where the southern busway helps immensely), and his wife does some casual work to help make a living. He said at one point that he could not save a cent, but has still managed to buy a car.  Given that you are going to Herston, my guess is that you are in the medicine-related discipline. Try applying for/switching to NHMRC or Queensland Cancer Council scholarship if possible. They give more in living stipend. (Three years ago, NHMRC was $30k per annum) Top-ups also exist, but you will have to hurry since you need to apply within the first six months of starting PhD.  Lastly, do contact scholarship office or your postgraduate coordinator. Many universities offer top-ups for having dependants (kids, non-working spouse, etc.). IIRC, UQ is a bit of a [censored] for not offering any (Griffith, RMIT and UNSW do, from my memory),  but I could be in the wrong."

brisbane,3du34r,tyronomo,4,Sun Jul 19 21:29:04 2015 UTC,They teach books how to read themselves. 13/troll
brisbane,3du34r,supreme_101,2,Sun Jul 19 21:32:41 2015 UTC,So you ask a question I need more details on. Is this teacher-librarian an auxiliary/support role? primary school? University?  I need more
brisbane,3du34r,diceyo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:38:32 2015 UTC,Let's go for high school TL positions :) can't give you much more than that as I'd be putting words in your mouth.
brisbane,3du34r,supreme_101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:01:46 2015 UTC,"Okay!   As a preference towards a teaching librarian position, I dare say you would be auxiliary support, engaging with students when required as a somewhat substitute teacher as a secondary position.  Library position would dare be the more predominant position, doing the Dewey decimal, like it's nobody's business!"
brisbane,3du34r,diceyo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:38:06 2015 UTC,Thank you :) I find it interesting that TL positions are considered auxiliary rather than a leadership role within a school.
brisbane,3du34r,supreme_101,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:37:05 2015 UTC,"Well I would see librarian as a main position, with substitute teaching capability when required, as in the library I've always felt that I am going to self-learn or study, not to be taught. So on that side i'd imagine I was in that area i wouldnt need to be taught per-se"
brisbane,3du34r,catalytic_tangent,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:51:08 2015 UTC,"Difficult question to answer, probably each of the TL's that I work with would give you a different answer. Regarding Aux vs leadership roles, some schools can segregate departments and others mash them together. ie, in some IT and library is very close, in others completely separate occasionally leading lib to have leadership when it comes to information services etc but it ultimately depends on how multi-faceted the library team is and where the school places its priorities. Our TL's do everything from teaching lessons, technology integration into classrooms revolving around research, display creation, event management, library observation, class support when they're held in the library, after school activity monitoring and tutoring management"

I have a friend who is involved with a lot of Aboriginal rallies/protests and she can't stand them. She says they always pop up and latch on to the Aboriginal rallies making it about themselves. It seems like it's the same thing here. Reclaim Australia's ranks seem to be filled with uneducated yobbos but then the alternative at these rallies seem to be filled with wannabe anarchists and these Socialist Alternative lot. I don't like nor fall under either of these groups. It seems like there is little room for anything other than two extremes.

If the police chastise/detain someone, it's probably gonna be an SA member. They rock up and start chanting totally unrelated slogans (""Always was, always will be Aboriginal land"" chants when we're fighting for marriage equality? I mean, I sympathise with Indigenous folks but protests like these require a consistent message that's at least vaguely related to the cause). And then once they've latched on to the protest, they'll start trying to sell their shitty publications to passers-by and maybe even have the audacity to set up a stall to try and recruit new members/push petitions/sell merch/otherwise turn people off.  This issue has been raised on the sub before only to have SA members say ""Well at least we're doing something, without us there wouldn't even be any protests!"" which shows you how arrogant they are. Apparently the Melbourne protest turned violent when one of the anti-fascists ""kicked the shit out of a nazi"" (trying to find the link), $5 says it was someone from SA.

I know full well going in that the counter protest is largely organised by the extreme left, the socialist and anarchist groups that come and go, and they're often pretty hysterical and alienating. I'm not a socialist, or an anarchist or a Muslim, I'm a center left capitalist and I know the only way these protests will become less alienating to the public and become more productive is if more moderates actually take the time to participate.   Case in point, today when I was standing on the front line of the counter protest, an officer from the QPS negotiation unit approached us asking who they could talk to in an organisation capacity to ensure everything went smoothly, assuring us he respected our right to voice our opinion. A very young man took umbrage at this and loudly and obnoxiously accused the nice man of ""protecting the fascists"", I told him to take it easy, that he's just there protecting the rights of both groups to freely assemble and gave the bloke the information. The kid took a step back from his high horse and conducted himself better. It was a small victory, but I think it shows the value in participating in activism as a moderate.

Secondly, many if not most people in groups like SAlt adhere to the idea of cultural relativism in that ""powerful"" groups have no right to tell ""oppressed"" groups what to do: and as Muslims are generally ""oppressed"" they generally prefer to gloss over or ignore things like Islamism (Islam being used as a political tool for terrorism). If they have critiques of authoritarian, misogynistic, homophobic politics excusing itself as religious theology, these are secondary considerations to how they consider members of that faith to be oppressed."

brisbane,3dsnnv,Meapa,14,Sun Jul 19 05:35:51 2015 UTC,"I was off to catch a plane once and had to take public transport to get there. I jumped on the bus in Bardon and told the driver where I was going and he said, ""Mate, just sit down, the rides free because the prices to the airport from here are stupid and I don't agree with them."" I was surprised and happy from this. This was back in 2009 or there abouts."
brisbane,3dsnnv,niceride,24,Sun Jul 19 07:04:25 2015 UTC,"This one time I went to the bus stop, waved and got on said ""Good morning"" to the driver who closed the door and we went on our way.  It was intense."
brisbane,3dsnnv,Elderberrian,11,Sun Jul 19 03:23:54 2015 UTC,"Not exactly a story, but how crazy is the right hand turn into that narrow ass tunnel at Queen Street Bus station?!"
brisbane,3dsnnv,jjc_96,12,Sun Jul 19 06:10:18 2015 UTC,"JJ, I can confirm, since I did my bus driver training shortly after the Queen Street underground system was brought into service. There's a knack to it, you know.    Once you have entered the down-ramp and come to that corner, you line your bus up so your seat is more or less RIGHT in line with the tap built into the wall there (not sure if it's still there though), go full right lock and ease on through.  :)  Simple when you know how."
brisbane,3dsnnv,OzRockabella,10,Sun Jul 19 10:07:12 2015 UTC,"And the super narrow overtakes at the Cultural Centre Station, usually <20cm from scraping another bus. Bus drivers have mad skillz."

brisbane,3dsnnv,poopymcfuckoff,13,Sun Jul 19 14:10:54 2015 UTC,"This happened about two months ago. Every afternoom when I would catch the school bus (TransLink bus) home, there would be a a fairly old man in a red hoodie standing at a corner recording our bus with his phone. He would stand at a different corner everyday and record us, such as a near a McDonalds or in front of a skatepark. A couple of my friends brought it up to the Principal who later spoke to our Bus Driver about it. He said the man could possibly be learning a students scheduke and to report to him if we see him again. We never saw him again until a couple of weeks later.  Two kids were about to get off the bus and our driver yelled at them to get back in. They quickly hurried in and the bus driver shut the doors, turned around and drove back to the school. Since me and some friends was sitting at the back of the bus, we looked out of the window as the bus was turning around and could see the man in the red hoodie standing next to his car about 50 metres in front of us. He waved as we looked at him.  Our driver reported to the Principal who later called the police. We never heard anything back from them."
brisbane,3dsnnv,PieAndKitteh,7,Sun Jul 19 03:55:36 2015 UTC,"GG bus driver. When I was in school they would have yelled for us to get off the bus faster,  and we'd've been scared enough of the bastard to do it."
brisbane,3dsnnv,fatmand00,2,Sun Jul 19 04:59:58 2015 UTC,Our driver is a fairly nice bloke. I've definitely had my fair share of dickhead bus drivers though. I wouldn't want to know what would've happened if he didn't tell them to get back on.
brisbane,3dsnnv,PieAndKitteh,3,Sun Jul 19 05:07:51 2015 UTC,In my later years if high school I became convinced BT was hiring from the Russian prison system. All the drivers in my area were scary Eastern European guys with tatoos and a hatred of schoolkids.
brisbane,3dsnnv,fatmand00,13,Sun Jul 19 06:13:56 2015 UTC,"A bus driver refused to sell my brother a concession ticket, even with a valid highschool student card. His reasoning was that student discounts ""only apply on school days (Mon-Fri)"". He even told us that he doesn't sell student tickets on school days if it's not within a few hours of school times (8AM-3PM). I told him how wrong that was to which he said, ""No, everyone is doing it wrong.""  Just didn't bother dealing with that crazy and caught a different bus without a crazy driver. Ugh."
brisbane,3dsnnv,pikachumeat,8,Sun Jul 19 04:33:40 2015 UTC,Did you not realise students suddenly become rich outside of school hours?
brisbane,3dsnnv,saltesc,6,Sun Jul 19 06:31:41 2015 UTC,Yes. I now know the errors of my ways.  I also understand that students are directly at fault for not using the bus during school hours.
brisbane,3dsnnv,pikachumeat,7,Sun Jul 19 06:41:14 2015 UTC,The craziest part to me is that you live somewhere in Brisbane where there was more than one bus option.

brisbane,3dsnnv,fatmand00,2,Sun Jul 19 06:10:57 2015 UTC,they all go to the city. they may not end up in the EXACT same spot but they all end at one of the transit hubs.
brisbane,3dsnnv,BitterBandit,2,Sun Jul 19 07:51:06 2015 UTC,Sounds like you possibly live in the place I grew up in.  We didn't even HAVE a bus service til 2001 or so.  And then it was hit and miss if they decided to stop for you or not...

Also, after we'd lived there for about 6 months my dad bought an old Jeep he was going to restore (don't think he ever did though) so my friends and I hooned around Gumdale in that - unroadworthy, unregistered and unlicensed but a lot of fun.

One american couple tried to get on through the back door of the bus. This was before city gliders and they said they'd been in Brisbane a while so I don't know what made them think it was ok.  They both had tickets but refused to come to the front of the bus to show the driver. He started to close the door on them before they were fully on the bus (it didn't pose a danger to them) and the male partner comes up to the front of the bus and just starts screaming at this poor driver, about how his wife was pregnant and they wanted to get a seat before the people who had lined up to get on at the front.  The screaming doesn't stop and the pair try to get back on the bus with their expired tickets but the driver hails down some security to pull them away. By that time other passengers were telling them to get off so they could go home.  I know not all American tourists are bad, but these guys rose the bar for that steryotype"

Too many times buses haven't come at all or were terribly late, it was causing us to waste too much time travelling. I only use public transport now for public events that might not have parking or taxi services easily avaliable. Uber for everything else.   For my SO and I to use public transport for work, no skiving off tickets, it would be 2 1/2 hours of travel per day each and $70 EACH or so dollars, not including waiting times or missed busses, with one connection. Price of fuel? $50 a week for the both of us, and half an hour of travel. I don't think I'll ever go back."

I needed to get from the city to woolloongabba and only had a ten dollar note. The bus driver said he did not have any change. I said does that mean I can just get on? No he says. Since I did not have correct change he could not let me on.  I corrected him and advised that he was in fact just choosing not to let me on. He took offence and told me to get off the bus. I told him that I hope he dies in a fire and got off the bus. I just drive every where now. Fuck public transport.
brisbane,3dsnnv,nothinbeatsagoodshit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:16:40 2015 UTC,"I'm confused, did he refuse to let you just pay $10 for the trip, or were you claiming that because he couldn't give you change, you should get to ride for free?

I take me seat and I see that he taking money and giving a tickets to a someone that looks to be a international student so I'm thinking was I let on because I'm white? :/   Couple stops later a girl with headphone on jumps on swipes her go card and just like me red lights and the insufficient funds tune plays but she is oblivious so she keeps on waking to a seat.  The bus driver started with a inside voice 'excuse me' and worked up to yelling at the top of his voice to get her attention so she can pay for a ticket.  I know the bus driver is just doing his job but I was wondering why he didn't do it with me??? I was coming to the conclusion that the driver was a sexist nazi but it dawn on me that the only thing I did that the others didn't do was say 'Good morning' before I got on the bus."

Like, would the amortised cost of paying a fine if you ever get caught be more or less than the cost of just paying for the bus each time? I know that I've never once had an inspector check me before, so it seems like you'd nearly always get away with it. How much are the fines?  Not that I'd ever actually do it. I like our public transport system in Brisbane, I think it's actually a really good one. It would feel wrong to cheat it. But it's an interesting thought experiment."

brisbane,3dsb72,concubovine,4,Sat Jul 18 23:52:32 2015 UTC,I suspect part of their motivation is not wanting to pay the fees that will be imposed for landings using the ILS. ILS is still gold standard for landings in bad weather.
brisbane,3dsb72,anonymousidiot397,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:03:08 2015 UTC,It does say something like that in the article;   the cost of the system does not justify the benefits   That doesn't mean that they're putting passengers at risk though. Just that they have to occasionally divert planes instead of increasing charges across the board.
brisbane,3dsb72,wallyupdabungenstein,4,Sun Jul 19 01:20:39 2015 UTC,"They'll probably want GBAS.  http://www.airservicesaustralia.com/projects/ground-based-augmentation-system-gbas/  I've heard its cheaper, and most of the airlines are suited for it (i.e. have the equipment for it already, unlike GA)."
brisbane,3dsb72,Kustav,2,Sun Jul 19 04:10:34 2015 UTC,"They should get it. No reason why the aircraft would fly that approach in visual meteorological conditions. GBAS as has been said could be an alternative but I don't think it allows aggresively curved approaches, doubt it could match the existing VORS approach in that regard.  The article didn't go into detail but the airport probably want Qantas to help pay for it (through initial capital or landing fees I guess).  Having international jet arrivals doing circling approaches in the muck is usually reserved for tinpot third world destinations."
brisbane,3dsb72,Whisky-354,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed. GBAS won't provide any significant benefit over ILS, and being that it's only in trial in Sydney at the moment with Qantas, I don't expect it to be of any practical use for quite some time. RNP is a nice idea, but with so many IFR crews/aircraft not capable of the RNP standards required, ILS is a tried and tested universal approach (heh) to this."

Secondly, in my experience, yeah, I've seen some women be rude at elevators. I've also seen some men be rude at elevators. On the whole, I've found that most people are polite regardless of their gender. I try to judge people on an individual basis and not make broad generalizations based on a few complaints about social etiquette, because that would be fucking stupid."

There's a lot of bogan dickheads, both in the city and in the suburbs - though the deeper issue is that most people who aren't dickheads are too timid to call them out for it/stand up to it.  As shitty as it is to say, unless you're willing to put a lot of work into social change or risk getting into a fistfight with a 300lb bogan, it's just something you have to put up with every now and then.

brisbane,3dpxp1,Cyrridven,7,Sat Jul 18 08:28:30 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you're looking for hospo/retail jobs to get you through to the end of your degree, rather than career related employment.  Not going to sugarcoat it, most of these places will be unwilling to give someone your age (ie more money) work when you don't have an employment history and while there are so many others that do.  So I have a few tips. Firstly, does your resume specify that your volunteer work is voluntary? If so, change it. I don't mean lie, but change the heading to ""Work Experience"" or something rather than volunteer work.   Secondly get your RSA (and maybe your RSG if you feel like it) - there are plenty of creditable places online and it'll take you less than thirty bucks and maybe an hour of your time.  Finally, I think your best bet is temp agencies, working towards getting a bit more experience/exposure. You didn't mention what side of town you were, but all the agencies that provide for suncorp/the gabba will take people with little to no experience and while the hours are varied, the money is very good for hospo work. Spotless and Manpower are two names that jump to mind, but I'm sure there are others.  Oh and I guess one final thing - if these are the industries you're looking for work in, unless you're applying for the big companies,   make a live appearance to hand in your application!"
brisbane,3dpxp1,duckmucking,2,Sat Jul 18 09:08:31 2015 UTC,"I am aware that it's really difficult, I try not to let it get me down. My resume doesn't explicitly mention volunteering at all.  I tried for my RSA today, just waiting for the processing.  I've seen and applied for lot of Temp agency stuff on Seek, but they usually specify 9-5 or previous experience. Would it be better to contact them directly?   Thanks for the tip about the live appearances. I have wanted to do that for awhile, but keep hearing people say that nearly everything is online now."
brisbane,3dpxp1,Zandapander,3,Sat Jul 18 09:28:01 2015 UTC,"If you are doing education, it never hurts to have experience in that area. Try and get some casual work in a childcare centre or do nanny work on the weekend"

brisbane,3dpxp1,alfie1806,2,Sat Jul 18 10:01:02 2015 UTC,but I won't have the money for a few weeks.   There are free courses in child care around the place.

brisbane,3dq3tg,catlinfd,4,Sat Jul 18 12:34:16 2015 UTC,"Need some more information to give you a definite answer,   How old are you? Do you have 2 years or more work experience in any field?  Are you involved in any extra-curricular activities or volunteering?  What is your highest level of education obtained to date?"
brisbane,3dq3tg,catlinfd,2,Sat Jul 18 12:39:37 2015 UTC,"I am 20 years old, yes I have 2 years work at a car wash and a chip shop (terrible work experience I know), I do not currently volunteer but I will do for at least a year of volunteering before applying, I am part of a sailing team, and I graduated year 12"
brisbane,3dq3tg,kaj89,9,Sat Jul 18 12:44:06 2015 UTC,"You don't need relevant work experience, it just adds to your overall competitiveness. Working in a car wash means you're accustomed to hard work and probably have good attention to detail skills. Working in a chip shop means you have people skills and customer service skills. You might not think the skills gained from your work experience are important but they are. You have to be able to provide customer service (maybe not the same way as you would in a retail environment) as a police officer as well as know how to interact and talk to people from a magnitude of backgrounds & cultures. Attention to detail is important because if you miss something on the job, someone, more importantly yourself, may be injured or there might be consequences - whatever they may be.   Police officers come from all walks of life. I know ones who used to be teachers, ones who were tradies and ones who worked in callcentres in a sales environment. Lots of jobs can give you skills that you can transition into law enforcement. Yes, it is indeed nice to have experience in the criminal justice of protective services sector (e.g. security guard) but it is not necessary.   At your age, assuming you pass all the processes, you'll either be knocked back for no life experience or put into the merit pool and eventually the academy, either in Townsville or Oxley. When an applicant gets knocked back for insufficient life experience it means recruiting does not feel based upon your current status you would be able to A.) handle the job or B.) perform in the job. The main reasons, from my understanding, for being knocked back is A.) lack of education or B.) lack of work experience. It could also be from your formed answers at the panel interview.   Will a Diploma of Justice Studies diminish your application? Hell no. Will it looks favorably on your application? Yes. It shows you actually are serious about becoming a police officer. It also gives you relevant criminal and evidentiary procedures for Queensland. Will it benefit you once you leave the police service? Depends but I would worry about that later.   In Queensland, there is what is called a Certificate III Guarantee. Meaning you can get a Certificate II and III from a RTO/TAFE at a concessional rate. You could use that to your advantage to not only save you money, but put some post-secondary education on your curriculum vitae. There may also be funding available for Certificate IV for upskilling and make sure if you are going to do a Diploma, do it on VET-HELP. Do not get sucked into paying money upfront for a Diploma level course. Avoid CLET completely. I would also avoid doing an apprenticeship, those are a lot of work and chances are it will have been both a waste of time and money if you become a police officer.   Some certificates you may want to look at:   Certificate II & III in Security Operations  Certificate IV & Diploma of Small Business Management Certificate IV & Diploma of Frontline Management Certificate IV & Diploma of Security and Risk Management  Certificate IV & Diploma of Justice Studies  Certificate IV & Diploma of Criminology and Criminal Justice   Do note for Certificate IVs or Diplomas, you can also get credit points towards a university degree.   Some recongized training providers:   Asset Training Australia TAFE East Coast TAFE Brisbane TAFE Sydney (Online Courses) Open Universities Australia (Online Courses) Griffith University  QUT   Any course will give you generic skills and add to your competitiveness as a QPS candidate. Honestly I'd start with a Certificate II and III as they're much shorter than a Diploma and less costly under the QLD Certificate III Guarantee. If you are interested in any of the courses above, I can recommend providers and give you a cost estimate."

So you do not think an apprenticeship is a good idea? My thinking is I would like something I can do as a possible after police scenario (just in case). But I am not deadset on doing one and will definitely take you advice and consider it. My friend (same age) just got sent to Townsville and he had McDonalds (which I heard employers love)and church volunteering, so I plan to do as much volunteering as possible once my situation improves. I am definitely keen to do any sort of courses that will help my chances of getting in. My application will be average at best at the moment and obviously want to improve it as much as possible. Are you a police officer? If you dont mind me asking. Again thanks for getting back to me"
brisbane,3dq3tg,Derek-Dangerous,2,Sat Jul 18 14:06:42 2015 UTC,"With an apprenticeship, it could range from a year long to three years. You also get paid apprenticeship wages which is approximately $9 dollars an hour at best. I don't believe there is a point in doing one before applying for the police service. You might as well just apply right now and see how you go instead of committing yourself to a apprenticeship that could take up multiple years of your life. You can knock off a diploma level course in 3-6 months depending on how much you put into it and the method of studying so even a diploma level course is more feasible than an apprenticeship. If you end up retiring or leaving the police service before the time you hit 60 years of age, you can find a much better position than working as a laborer or tradie due to your law enforcement experience, e.g. security manager, safety investigator, risk manager, investigations, fraud detection, compliance, law enforcement support personnel etc. You could make more money and benefits as a security manager or in risk management/legal compliance role than you would working in a post-apprenticeship career and not have to conduct manual labor or physical tasks.    Queensland Police Service is going to extensively hire this year and into next year. You should either do a Certificate or Diploma course right now or just apply. You have a 50/50 chance right now of either progressing into the academy or being knocked back. If you get knocked back, reapply after making yourself a better candidate.   Ensure you keep your fitness up. Don't let it lapse. At the very minimum, ensure you do cardio every day or every couple of days. The fitness standards may not be that much demanding for the hiring process but it DOES get more demanding once you get into the police academy."
brisbane,3dq3tg,ben_bbq,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:32:38 2015 UTC,I really appreciate all your help and advise and have taken it to heart thank you so much. I am going to take a year to get the required licence and in that time I am going to do a diploma and am taking apprenticeship off the table. Also after talking to my friend at the academy as well as yourself I definitely need to work on my fitness level in that time too. I am currently working as a concrete line hand (pumping concrete all day). Am i better off finding a different job that would help my application in this time too? And what course would you recommend?

The central rail will be connected to a vertical in the centre for strength, then fix to the headboard and the foot board.  Lay/fix your slats on and you're done.  It'll probably all be allen keys with tool supplied to get it done.

brisbane,3dqd9x,brismedic,2,Sun Jul 19 01:20:00 2015 UTC,"If you haven't built anything before, it might overwhelm you a little bit.  Ikea manuals don't have words, and are mostly diagrams. This makes assembly very difficult at first because the instruction looks cryptic. But it gets exponentially easier once you learn how to follow it.  The assembly instruction for this furniture looks very standard for a bed frame. As long as you don't panic (which I did the first time I made a cloth drawer) and faithfully follow the manual, you should be fine."

brisbane,3dqd9x,wimmywam,2,Sun Jul 19 01:13:38 2015 UTC,Not difficult at all - there is no heavy bed head to deal with as well (which can make connecting the side rails on an angle difficult) so once you do the first one the other two will practically assemble themselves!

Really depends on what sort of things you enjoy doing. There are the art galleries at south bank, plus a whole host of restaurants or places to grab a coffee and enjoy the sun. Or west end, which again has restaurants and bars throughout. Which is all within walking/bus/train distance from where your staying.  You could also check out the botanical gardens in the city, or have a walk up queen st mall if you feel like shopping.  The casino on George st also has some night bars and restaurants attached, if you ever feel like a flutter.

brisbane,3dlp96,muntted,10,Fri Jul 17 08:03:06 2015 UTC,i think part of it was waiting until they went to pay on exit under the freeway rather than pay and display

brisbane,3dlp96,sfacets,4,Fri Jul 17 08:54:12 2015 UTC,yeah - get a ticket on entry and pay at the machines when you leave than stick your ticket into the exit and up goes the boomgates.  that started this year. it used to be pay and display (buy a ticket and stick it on ya dash)
brisbane,3dlp96,wimmywam,4,Fri Jul 17 08:57:14 2015 UTC,Amazed? Parking is a shambles at QUT.

brisbane,3dp4ge,irrevocablehate,11,Sat Jul 18 02:39:23 2015 UTC,No. It's not just about 'cold' as it gets cold enough in plenty of places and it still doesn't snow. It's about air currents and air pressure. Brisbane's positioning doesn't really lend itself to the right mix of both to result in snow.
brisbane,3dp4ge,DoctorDbx,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:01:13 2015 UTC,Also you have to take into consideration the fact that the only places along the border which received snow were all 700m+ above sea level.

I was drunker last Friday later on, when I was the only person standing outside in case I needed to protect the 5 foot female manager from an agro bloke that she was kicking out. Hey I'm no fighter, but I couldn't bear to see her bouncing a bloke by herself with no back up.  Yeah my drunken state wasn't questioned then !  Haha, just having a rant, I'm not worried.

Another method could be to use something like a belt sander, pressing it against is and checking it, adjusting your grip, repeat.  I would also tape up the area you don't want scratched up to prevent an accident.  I have a dremel, and a timber vice.  I don't have masking tape though. I have electrical, and cloth tape.

brisbane,3diwsn,dontcallmebecky,35,Thu Jul 16 17:13:42 2015 UTC,"Both my myself and my partner worked for Queensland Motorways/Go Via about a year or so ago, I doubt much has changed since then.  First off, whatever you do, do not just pay the tolls amount and ignore the fines.  You need to call the Go Via number and explain the situation and if your really lucky, they may reduce it to $200 - $300.  However, they may insist you pay the full amount.  As much as your not going to like hearing this, and as much as you'll want to just say ""stuff them, they arent getting my $500"", you just need to pay it.  Basically, if you don't pay the amount they ask of you after you call them, then those unpaid tolls and fines get sent to SPER, the State Penalties and Enforcement Register and they will add $140 to each toll.  Thats right, not $140 total, but $140 per toll, you can do the math, but I imagine that by this point your up to a few thousand at least.  If you then ignore the first SPER letter and dont pay within their time frame they add a SPER late fee of $50 per infringement.  If you then ignore this amount they will suspend your license until you have either paid in full or entered into a SPER payment plan.  Once they have suspended your license and you still havent made contact, they can garnish your pay, send people to your place of employment etc.  So basically, call them and beg and plead and explain your a dumbarse from out of town and ask they show some lenience and reduce the fines.  Pay that amount.  If there is simply no way for you to pay that amount, once it goes to SPER and they tack on another few thousand than at least organise a payment plan so you dont lose your license etc.  Hope this helps."

One month the word would be, Yes, if its someones first time and its a genuine mistake then waive the fees, the nest month we would receive an email from the higher ups stating absolutely no fees to be wiaved under ANY circumstance.  It was not unusual for a situation like one I had once where a mother lent her car to her 17 year old son who had just got his license and his first job and was travelling down the logan motorway onto the gateway motorway each day thru 3 tolls each way.  He was young and maybe a bit irresponsible and didnt pay the tolls and didnt bother telling his mum about the tolls. After a couple of months of this te mum got  letter with over 200 unpaid tolls, each with a $20 fine.  OVER $4000!!!  She refused to pay and we refused to waive any fees.  It went to SPER where it then became over $30000 in tolls and fines.     It's not really a fair and balanced penalty for less than $1000 of original tolls."
brisbane,3diwsn,fishburgr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:01:04 2015 UTC,So who's liable. Owner of car rego or driver?
brisbane,3diwsn,Kalanski,2,Fri Jul 17 15:34:27 2015 UTC,"The registered owner of the car gets all the original bills and then they need to send in a stat dec with the all the drivers details, name, dob, address and have it signed by a JP.  In the above case she wasnt going to put all that financial burden on her son."
brisbane,3diwsn,fishburgr,2,Fri Jul 17 15:40:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not ready to be a dad just yet.  ""Have fun filing bankruptcy pal, catch ya at christmas"""
brisbane,3diwsn,Kalanski,-6,Fri Jul 17 15:43:03 2015 UTC,Agreed. How dare a company that pays to build a road be entitled to payment from those who use it!   /s
brisbane,3diwsn,snuffy69,8,Fri Jul 17 12:40:33 2015 UTC,"Queensland Motorways/Govia/Gateway Bridge Company was sold from public ownership to a consortium of Transurban, Australian Super and Tawreed Investments. This happened on 02/07/2014, just over a year ago.  So far as I'm concerned, the public built the roads, bridges, etc through the state government, the taxes were paid, it was a public asset, it made the public money.  Now we sell this off and still enforce state penalties while the public funds a private interest? Your head must be frozen to the core if you find this acceptable."
brisbane,3diwsn,Mercness,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:47:59 2015 UTC,"Okay, so at this current point it has been sent to SPER and I have been advised that they will add $140 per infringement OR see multiple daily tolls as a ""round trip"". Also the operator mentioned that some may go to debt collectors and some may go to SPER. As I'm not the licence holder he couldn't give me any real information - what is your experience with the ""round trip"" fee and infringements going to debt collectors?"
brisbane,3diwsn,DoctorDbx,10,Tue Jul 21 08:08:17 2015 UTC,Your only option is to call them and plead ignorance / stupidity / language barrier / for mercy... and hopefully they will knock a few $$$ off.  Those giant signs before every toll warning you of penalties aren't just there for the sake of whacking another sign up. Whilst I sympathize with your plight... how did you think this wouldn't apply to you?
brisbane,3diwsn,poopymcfuckoff,8,Thu Jul 16 22:38:54 2015 UTC,"Same. I dislike people who come from out of town and whinge when they get fined for stuff that is very clearly signed. You know you're coming to brisbane, read up on it first.  Also, it very clearly says you have 3 days to go online or call and pay. If I need to in a different car, I just do it the moment I get out."
brisbane,3diwsn,dubious_virtue,-3,Fri Jul 17 00:38:16 2015 UTC,"Except half the time you don't see the signs until it is too late.  I've driven in dozens of countries many with non Latin alphabets and Qld, Brisbane in particular, is the most poorly signed. Signs up too late, irrelevant information, signs only a local would understand, etc etc.   And to top it all off is the delightful parochialism of unsympathetic locals."
brisbane,3diwsn,BitterBandit,2,Fri Jul 17 05:15:00 2015 UTC,"I wholeheartedly agree. Now that we live here and have mistakenly taken each toll road at least once, we know where they are. but upon first coming here, it was a nightmare."
brisbane,3diwsn,poopymcfuckoff,-4,Sat Jul 18 03:03:21 2015 UTC,"Well then fuck off.  We live in a world of information and people still choose ignorance. I research where to drive when I visit sydney, do the same in brisbane"
brisbane,3diwsn,BitterBandit,4,Fri Jul 17 07:39:05 2015 UTC,"So you think if you came here for the first time you would know where every toll road was, and what it looked like and where to avoid it? You'd never get tripped up and take a turn one road/exit/entrance early? You'd catch every sign regardless of night or day?  Must be nice being perfect.  And Sydney is a pretty bad example. I never had any toll charges when I visited Sydney either, despite not meticulously planning every drive either. Probably something about having clear and understandable signage."
brisbane,3diwsn,poopymcfuckoff,-5,Sat Jul 18 03:15:20 2015 UTC,"Oh one or two accidental toll roads isnt that bad... but $500 worth? They said they were going in circles, so they drove past the signs multiple times."
brisbane,3diwsn,D_S_W,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:00:21 2015 UTC,3 days to pay is clearly not long enough.
brisbane,3diwsn,BitterBandit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:49:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not from Brisbane and there has definitely been a few cases of, wtf how did i get onto this toll road. Theres even been a couple cases of not even realising it was a roll road until i got the bill. They may be be signed, but theres a lot of entrances where its not CLEARLY signed which side of the road hits or merges into the toll road. and by the time you figure it out theres no way to change your mind."

brisbane,3diwsn,hexagrm,11,Fri Jul 17 08:56:51 2015 UTC,"I sold my motorcycle at the start of this year.   Before I did a buyer took it on a test ride. He went through a toll. I did not know this.   I sold the bike a week later.   I rang go-via to make sure there were no outstanding fees on the bike rego. There were none.   I move house, I change address with transport dept.  2 months later I get pulled over by police.   Cop ""you have no licence""  Me ""what? Yes I do""  Cop ""get out and walk, here is your court date""  The toll went from Go via to SPER at the time I checked that the rego was clean for tolls. My address didn't get transferred to my new place with SPER which meant I had no idea that I had owing tolls.   I lost my licence for a month and paid over a grand in fines. Now I have 4 points for a year. Because of a guy taking my bike over the go between.   Toll Co's are super powerful its a disgrace."

brisbane,3diwsn,peachinessss,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:58:00 2015 UTC,"How did you go? My exp, there is two companies with toll roads in brisbane and govia will not pay the other. As I didn't know this I racked up an extra payment on top of the toll. All it took was a phone call to explain and they waived the extra fee and all I had to pay was the toll. Not saying it will happen but a phone call is best. Also, if you can afford the time, take them to court. They will find it hard to justify the extra payment as admin. Banks always waive that fee if pushed and no court will see the extra as reasonable. Risky but worth it. There is a guy online who does it for you also."
brisbane,3diwsn,Daclam,6,Sat Jul 18 14:07:36 2015 UTC,I certainly wouldn't be paying the tolls without getting some advice further.  My advice would be to take this as a costly but not life changing lesson to pay attention. Trying to get out of bills from big companies when you have done the wrong thing is really just not worth your time/money.
brisbane,3diwsn,florexium,2,Thu Jul 16 17:32:59 2015 UTC,"That sucks, I remember I racked up a few myself when I first started driving into the city and couldn't work out what toll roads were what. Id definitely ring up and plead your case and hope they have some empathy. Also when I had to pay a larger toll amount I applied for a payment plan so you can stretch out the payment to make it easier. Good luck!"

brisbane,3diwsn,Kalanski,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:45:35 2015 UTC,It doesn't have to be many. I got a bill the other day for tolls that we went through in the couple days after buying a car and before adding it to our Govia account. $43  or $350 if not paid within 3 days.
brisbane,3diwsn,shootphotosnotarabs,4,Sat Jul 18 00:46:48 2015 UTC,"Pay the fine and take it as a life lesson in being more aware of your surroundings and accountability for your actions.  Don't try and weasel out of the payment as they use SPER and you will be fucked.  Either that or hire a lawyer, and is it really worth it over $500?"
brisbane,3diwsn,Phoenixzeus,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:32:08 2015 UTC,"Either that or hire a lawyer, and is it really worth it over $500?   A lawyer is going to charge $250/hour+ anyway, and I'm not sure if they'll achieve much? I mean the OP isn't denying driving through the toll roads or failing to pay within the 3 day window. It's probably more cost effective just to take fishburgr's approach and pay whatever's owing from there."

An entirely new concept.   That's the problem with Go Via and the tolls. There are a handful of signs saying ""three days to pay"" and that is all the warning you get.   If your not from Brisbane then it's something that could be missed very easily. But not according to u/Phoenixzeus, that bloke knows everything going on around him at all times constantly."

There are a handful of signs saying ""three days to pay"" and that is all the warning you get.    Bullshit, there's multiple signs saying ""Toll Road ahead"" and ""Last exit before Toll"".  There's then multiple signs saying ""Three days to pay"".   Google Maps and most GPS devices will advise you of toll roads in advance too.  Sure toll fees suck and I avoid toll roads unless I'm in the company car, but you can't possibly be unware of toll roads after driving through them multiple times like OP said.  And no, I don't work for Go Via, I despise the company but it doesn't make my points any less valid."

brisbane,3di7pn,haakon666,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:24:06 2015 UTC,"A Nissan Leaf. My average efficiency is worse than most Leaf drivers. Due to my above average rate of accelerating off at the lights ;)  The increased daily charge is actually designed to target users like yourself, who self produce a good % of their power. However it does bring forward the day it is financially worth it to defect from the grid."

Waaay cheaper than a Tesla. Keep an eye out for the odd one now popping up as a used sale, for good prices. The drivetrain is bullet proof  I've also test drove the Tesla Model S P85 recently. Holy shit it's fast, it's everything the Leaf is but dialed up to 11 (especially the looks and the size :/ ). If you are ever in Sydney, it's worth booking ahead and doing the test drive."

All you can eat is $29 an includes prawns and zucchini and everything else, which is still going to be good value even if your 9yo can't put much away in the ol stomach. Also, it's easily accessible by public transport, but even better than that you can just drive straight into the Valley get a spot in the Chinatown carpark right behind Chingu, and then pay cash when you settle the bill and they will write off your parking ticket, too.  The menu variety is wide enough,  when we went recently it had more than what was on the online menu. And it's fun ordering a bit of this and a bit of that then cooking it at the table! I can see the appeal for a 9yo. Even for adults it is great."

brisbane,3dhh0w,Tickle_Me_Tortoise,5,Fri Jul 17 00:20:21 2015 UTC,"I'll start with a list:  Hanwoori (in city) is an all-you-can-eat type that will probably best suit you, especially on the weekdays when you won't see too many people drinking. Also, their ""side dish"" is very kids-friendly and of decent quality unlike other all-you-can-eat venues. The only downside is that their meat quality is a bit unpredictable - very good in one day, and then too fatty (even for Koreans) pork belly in another. Price is at $32 on weekdays and $35 in the weekends (for adults, not sure about kids).  There are a few more in Sunnybank/Sunnybank Hills.  Madang Galbi on Daw Rd and Midam on Beenleigh Rd will be able to cater to your needs. Both have good quality meat, have options to order other food, and at least on the weekdays, Madang Galbi should be able to give your group plenty of space. One of them has the all-you-can-eat price set at $25, another is on a per-dish basis, but I forgot which one is which.  Tobaki is popular, but my experience there was very underwhelming, and their atmosphere might not be for birthday parties (little lighting outside). The price was at $25 per person (all-you-can-eat), but that was a couple of years ago.  Daejangeum has good quality meat for its $25 all-you-can-eat price, but its table set-up is not for kids/parties.  There are a few more in this area, but I have not checked them out yet - no need to, since I already have favourites.  Most Korean places do some sort of barbecue, so please be sure to check others out too if you like the venue set-up. Some restaurants also have secluded bays to cater for small business dinners, etc., so you might want to ask the restaurant if it has one. Lastly, since you are bringing mainly kids, you would be able to haggle the total price down depending on the barbecue type, party size, etc."
brisbane,3dhh0w,yourasian,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:30:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) I appreciate the list.   Don't hold back with recommending things that aren't set up for kids - my kids are dragged from kid-friendly to non-kid-friendly restaurant. They're well behaved, well disciplined when they're not, and it's not a birthday party as much as it is a requested dinner with the grandparents.   We've been to Sunny Seoul before - but that's about it :) They were great, just not sure how they go with price etc in comparison, and the menus can be hard to find/decipher online."

The food was incredibly delicious and we were the only non-Korean people in there for most of the night, which to me says the food must be pretty good. The staff were very friendly too and very accommodating. It's BYO and you have the choice to BBQ your own meat or not.

Really just a snapshot image, not anything detailed, and by the time I grew up I kinda figured it was probably just a mis-remembering - maybe I watched something on the television and it stuck in my tiny mind, because 1) How often does it snow in Queensland, and 2) Why would we ever have been in Toowoomba?  In all the news this week I saw mention of the 1984 snows - ie, when I was 2, and so I dropped my mum a note. Turns out one of her friends was studying in Toowoomba back then so we all went up for the weekend. The snow was a surprise, and her friends didn't believe her when she saw it, so it was actually just her and me who went outside to play.

Haven't used satellite, not even sure if it is available within Brisbane, might only be available for regional and remote locations(bit like the old Foxtel/Austar arrangement).  Best of luck."

brisbane,3dhk0a,DasNocti,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:48:43 2015 UTC,"So you're expecting an average cost of 1$ per print?  I'm by no means an expert on the subject, but that seems low for colour inkjet printing on cotton paper.  Also, cost will probably be based on the design. The % of page cover that requires ink will affect your cost. So unless you're comparing the same design at both companies, thats not necessarily a fair comparison.  Im not suggesting that 400$ is a fair price - but i don't necessarily think 70$ is a reasonable expectation either. but again, that depends entirely on the design. If you have a 70% page cover for 400$ that might be reasonable, where as if you have 10% page cover it may not be."
brisbane,3dhk0a,BitterBandit,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:38:03 2015 UTC,"Design is print ready using K only, (no Rich Black or spot colours). That's seriously a couple bucks of tone.  A bit more research has given me $270 for 7x A2 which makes sense as it also includes the paper and that's the expensive part, not a few mL of K. Unfortunately it's still tricky finding a local.  Considering DIY at this point but going to try printers in the other comments soon.  I'm still floored by the initial quote. $400 of printing only is just fucked up wrong. I presume the ""wedding"" bit on the design dazzled their eyes and they saw an opportunity to rip off. 12 years of photography and design though, I know a lot about printing. Unfortunately never used this medium before and the printers I use don't have the right machines for a texture that rough."

brisbane,3dcryy,tyronomo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:36:18 2015 UTC,"Of course you can. I didn't say you couldn't. Pets have just been proven to add to our well-being and have anti-depression/anxiety qualities (with both of those diseases so rife these days and blowing our healthcare costs through the roof). No, not saying that. There needs to be a happy medium. I've known friends who've found places for rent and the owner is so excited and accepts their application, only to reject it when they find out they have a pet. It should be the responsibly of the renters to accept any and all damage to a property, and be prosecuted to the full extent of the law if their pet damages it. If that isn't happening, then it's the law that needs to change. But I do not think it fair that people with pets are discriminated against. When property prices force most young people to rent for life, the current status quo will mean no one will be able to own pets. That sounds like a terribly sad state of affairs for our society. It is for me."

Not the logical question you'd expect at a wedding such as ""How do you know know the bride/groom?"", or ""I haven't seen you in years, what have you been up to?"" on the odd chance you might actually know someone there.

brisbane,3dg0ek,TheOneTodd,7,Thu Jul 16 13:35:20 2015 UTC,"BRISBANE — beautiful one day, perfect the next.    Blessed with warm weather, all-conquering sports teams and affordable housing — compared to other major cities — we have it pretty damn good.  But even the River City has a few problems, if you could call them that.  From bush turkeys to weather woes, here are 29 problems unique to Brisbane.  UNIQUELY BRISBANE PROBLEMS   Finding a car park in the CBD for less than your weekly wage. Only pulling on your warmest winter jacket for three days a year. Wondering whether you’ll ride a hover board before NBN is connected in your suburb. The inside of your car being hot enough to fry an egg after leaving it in the sun for an hour. Getting dinner from a restaurant other than a fast food chain after 9pm Google Maps confusing us with the town of Brisbane, California — population 4443. People from Sydney and Melbourne constantly referring to Brisbane as Australia’s “third city”. Battling with the realisation that we haven’t had a good AFL team in 12 years (and counting). Public transport being as affordable as parking in the CBD (not really, but close enough). Being asked where you attended school every time you meet someone. When international bands only play in Sydney and Melbourne. Being the only east coast city not on Daylight Savings time — creating major #spoileralert headaches. Tunnels, tunnels and more tunnels which mean tolls, tolls and more tolls. Leaving your smart phone in the car for 10 minutes and coming back to this message. Bush turkeys encroaching on your personal space. When your Go Card doesn’t touch on properly and you tap again only to be rudely beeped at. Having to replace your perfume/cologne with insect repellent in summer or risk being eaten alive by mosquitos. Having to drive 19 hours to see the Great Barrier Reef. State of Origin is a walk in the park. Subconsciously judging anyone who is born in Brisbane and doesn’t support the Broncos. Trying to keep pace with the 87th craft beer bar that has opened this week. When the barista doesn’t understand your request for a half strength short macchiato with a caramel swirl. When there are too many people waiting outside Hungry Jacks in the city to find the person you’re meeting with. Putting up with British people telling you about their latest “heatwave” while overseas. CityCycle. Being asked if you live north or south of the Brisbane River. Train WI-FI streaming video slower than dial up internet in 2002. Summer translating to consistent frizzy hair. When people refer to Brisbane as “Brisvegas”."
brisbane,3dg0ek,L1ttl3J1m,9,Wed Jul 15 23:53:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure there's a single ""uniquely Brisbane problem"" in that entire list."

Yeah, this one sucks about Brisbane. First-world problem and an easy fix. Who fucking cares? See 7 (sorry AFL fans).  Yeah, this is a major issue here, but again not unique to Brisbane. Doesn't get that far because they find out I'm a filthy southern Mexican.  feelsbadman.jpeg I don't give a flying fuck about spoiler alerts, but I do miss the extra daylight for late afternoon surfs in summer.  Tunnels are preferable to building more spaghetti bridges hugging the river everywhere. Tolls are expensive but that's a fact of life in a lot of cities, unfortunately. Any message from the CM at any given point in time is always going to be a problem.  They're piss-scared of people, I've never had one come within a few feet of me. Ibises at South Bank though... Aw, diddums. Better than dengue fever. Better than having to walk there, from say, Tasmania. This a problem because...? Judge all you want. Call the cops, see if I give a fuck. See 19. Large cap, one sugar, spare the bullshit. See 16. Putting up with people from other nationalities? Oh no, the horror? It's not that bad, and bikes aren't expensive if you know where to look if it's such a problem. See 20.  As /u/dannyr said, use 4G or just wait it out.  See 16. Who gives a shit?   Lazy list full of first-world problems."

Nothing really perks up your day than seeing an elderly couple hobble down a hill they shouldn't have to, thanks to dickheads taking up all the available space in front of the facility. Especially when you later see people briskly walking from the train station to those cars and driving off.  I recognise that they're not at fault.

brisbane,3dh2xz,gabbawocky,11,Thu Jul 16 05:48:30 2015 UTC,"The acaq( Australian climbers association Queensland)...the industry body for climbers in qld...is consulted every time they hang up one of these banners. The bolts used ,and the banners themselves, are installed by qualified rope access technicians ( again approved in consultation with the acaq) and the banners are hung for an amount of time and in a place to cause the least disruption to climbers possible.  Originally council consulted no one when right first started hanging these banners up an it caused massive uproar in the climbing community. Since learning from that experience, council has been in contact with the acaq before they hang the banners up.   Source: rockclimber and member of acaq"
brisbane,3dh2xz,MC_llama,-3,Thu Jul 16 06:27:29 2015 UTC,Least disruption would be not hanging them at all.  Last time around they had a security guard posted 24/7 cos threats were made against it.
brisbane,3dh2xz,azertyqwertyuiop,8,Thu Jul 16 06:50:52 2015 UTC,"Possibly. But the cliffs aren't for the sole use of us climbers. We need to remember that they are council property and we should be thankful that the council came to its senses and consults with us in the first place.  And seriously, there's like 320+ climbs at kp. Iyou can't find something else to climb beside the few crappy ones it covers for a few days? shit dude..."
brisbane,3dh2xz,MC_llama,-6,Thu Jul 16 07:26:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah I can't say I'm too cut up about the climbs it covers, it just seems like a pointless thing to do to me."
brisbane,3dh2xz,azertyqwertyuiop,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:36:54 2015 UTC,"So do I and pretty much every other climber in Brisbane. That's why we have the acaq representing us to deal with shit when governments do stupid things, like these banners,that affects us.  If you're not already, you should really consider becoming a member of the acaq Man. It's only $15/year and Without them you can guarantee it would've been a bigger mess."

Nothing but a waste of time unless they specifically seek you out for a position or you are applying for a job and they happen to match you with their criteria.  they are merely a means of filtering out applicants for employers, nothing more.  you are better off reaching out directly to employers than recruitment agencies."
brisbane,3dcc3x,karlosvonawesome,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:03:08 2015 UTC,"I have applied through Robert Walters, Adecco, Chandler Mcleoud.  You go in for an initial interview with them (writing down the experience you have had and what you hope to have). They get a brief understanding what you want from a job and things.  Once that interview has happened, give each place (who you have applied for) a call each week to see what jobs are going [it works both ways of communicating]. This shows initiative and determination to find some work.  All the best"
brisbane,3dcc3x,jumpingjacks07,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:21:36 2015 UTC,"I dealt with Chandler Macleod - they provide a bunch of services around writing your resume, prepping for interviews / practicing interviews, making sure your linkedin profile is set up so that you show up in employer searches that you want to show up in etc.   Nothing you can't do by yourself / with a friend, although they cut out a lot of the fuss and research from it - but I found they helped clarify what I was actually looking for, giving me some suggestions at alternatives I hadn't thought of etc. It was also good to have an actual recruiter reviewing things, since that is the audience you are aiming at.   I don't know if they charge for that under normal circumstances (was part of a redundancy package for me), but those services ended up being worth more to me than anything else - I got the next job through my linkedin references and profile, nothing that their recruitment networks can take credit for :P"
brisbane,3dc48r,myusernameisperfect,5,Wed Jul 15 02:54:45 2015 UTC,"I'd look perhaps towards caravan parks, as most of them have cabins that are self-cater and can often be around that cost.  The problem is of course that you don't find caravan parks too close to the CBD, and ones that do can be a bit rough (both in facilities and existing tenants).  The Newmarket Caravan Park which prides itself (according to the website) as being the ""closest caravan park to the city"" have on site caravans for under $350/wk, lodge rooms for $408/wk, or private cabins for $800+/wk.  NOTE: The Newmarket Caravan Park is no Aspley Acres Caravan Park (if anyone suggests you stay there - tell them thanks but no thanks) but historically it has had a name for itself housing those either on their way to or from jail.  Others may suggest some Caravan Parks that I don't know of with similar pricing?"
brisbane,3dc48r,dannyr,2,Wed Jul 15 04:20:41 2015 UTC,"I might be being a bit dramatic, but the idea of a caravan park is scary to me. They don't seem very secure and from what TV and movies have told me, the residents can be a little unsavoury. For $350 a week though, they might not be so bad.  I'm looking more at sharehouses now, lots of them for way under $350 for the two of us. Thank you for your idea though, it is something I hadn't thought of and will be good to have in the back of my mind!"
brisbane,3dc48r,dannyr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:42:01 2015 UTC,"I'm a big fan of caravan parks for short term.  The inner city ones are always a bit unsavoury from their clientele (as anywhere close to the city with cheap anything - food, beer, accommodation - always seems to be) but certainly out in the suburbs they're normally quite well serviced and maintained.    Some of the ""Big 4"" Caravan Parks, and ""holiday parks Australia"" parks (normally the ones you see in country towns or beach side towns) are freaking awesome.  Pools, tennis courts, etc and all for very reasonable prices."
brisbane,3dc48r,Paxxer87,3,Wed Jul 15 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"When my partner and I first moved to Brisbane we originally stayed at Aspley Acres (big mistake, we didn't know any better) for a week before getting told by the police (who visited daily) that we didn't belong there and that we should move on.   We found a place in New Farm called The Hub which is, I guess, kind of a backpackers/hostel type deal but you get your own unit, own kitchen, bedroom, living room etc, the only thing that is shared was the bathroom. It was rather cheap (I believe around $250 a week) and you could stay as long or as little as you needed. We lived there about 5 months while we looked for a proper rental property. There always seemed to be at least one unit empty, so chances of getting in aren't the worst. It is also very close to the CBD and the Valley, lots of eateries etc. We wouldn't have wanted to live there long term, but we found it quite ideal for a young couple moving to Brisbane from interstate just while we looked for a rental place."

brisbane,3d968c,MC_llama,6,Wed Jul 15 02:48:10 2015 UTC,"Shop at anaconda if you want crappy polyurethane thermals that don't breathe. You will sweat like a stuck pig and stink for days.  Do yourself a favour and buy decent merino wool thermals(ice breaker or puremerino) and you will be in a much better place.  Head to K2 ( I know k2 has 15% off icebreaker atm)or Paddy Pallin on Ann st in the valley instead of anaconda. Alternatively, icebreaker is an nz company so theoretically should be slightly cheaper to buy over there."
brisbane,3d968c,introvertebral,2,Wed Jul 15 03:15:53 2015 UTC,"Can't recommend Icebreaker enough. My partner is totally addicted, and I'm starting to get hooked too.

brisbane,3d968c,shakka877,3,Wed Jul 15 11:13:46 2015 UTC,I highly recommend the merino icebreakers you get from Paddy Pallin. Used them before in sub-zero temperatures with no dramas.

brisbane,3d968c,blackplague06,9,Wed Jul 15 08:10:32 2015 UTC,"Went to my dad's house for dinner on Monday, mostly because I was too stressed out to cook myself dinner.   I sat down, watched TV and played with his adorable Maltese dogs. He asked me if I still do my Indigenous art, to which I replied with, ""When I can think of the ideas.""   Dad's very cryptic, hard to figure out. He disappears from the living room, comes back with a 2m didgeridoo -- tells me to do him an artwork.   I, now, have a $300-500 didgeridoo sitting in my lounge room. He wants me to, after this one, paint one for each of his brothers and sister (six other siblings). He also made me pea and ham soup. Tomorrow he's making curried sausages.  EDIT: just figured out who my dad got the didgeridoo through, he sells them for a minimum of $750. Goddamn it, Dad."
brisbane,3d968c,ElfBingley,3,Tue Jul 14 14:22:02 2015 UTC,Most indigenous men I know would baulk at giving a didgeridoo to a woman. But maybe it varies across different people.
brisbane,3d968c,blackplague06,7,Tue Jul 14 22:31:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on the culture and family.   My family adores art, but very few of next generation kids do it - it's on loan to me until I finish it, then it'll be given back to my father.   In a way, it's dad acknowledging that I have completed my apprenticeship and have become an adult - it's a goddamn honour to be doing this, and it'll be an honour to do one for each of his siblings.   My cousin, Lancy Boy and myself are the only next generation kids that do art - that's two out of about 35 kids.   Sadly Lancy Boy died last year, so I'm the only one.   After my father's didgeridoo is complete, I'll be doing one for his father."

Shitty we lost him at such a young age, especially since he was an amazing artist (I'm 1/5 the artist he is) and a passionate community member.   With each recent passing, such as my great aunty (who was monumental in civil rights in the South Burnett), my aunty (a woman I admired quite a lot) and my cousin - I draw strength from them and hope I can even be a shred of what they are."
brisbane,3d968c,blackplague06,7,Wed Jul 15 02:47:03 2015 UTC,"Dad wants me to do a didgeridoo for each one of his siblings -- he's got four brothers and two sisters, but sadly one of my aunties passed away last year, so her didgeridoo will go to her eldest child.   My family often sort of does things for the family and passes them around, it's our way of showing we care.   And I grew up hearing three different tribes' stories -- my dad was born in the Barambah Missionary in the 60s, which is in Wakka Wakka land (not his tribe). Most of the stories I know are from the Wakka Wakka people, but my family has been there long enough that we're actually considered one of the founding families in the region.   We're also on the signatory delegation when it comes to Native Title.   I was also raised, mostly from my grandpa and grandmother, with stories from the Kullili (grandpa) and Gubbi Gubbi (grandmother) tribes.   Totem wise, most Indigenous people choose their own when they reach a certain age. My totems are the Emu and the Wedge-Tailed Eagle, but every person is different.   As for doing whatever -- I don't want to mess around with this didgeridoo, I'm gonna have to plan every detail about it, figure out a story I want to tell, and then paint it. It's basically my dad giving me the opportunity to expand on my artistry, and it's an honour."

My coffee machine is on a timer so that at 6am when my alarm goes off my first stop is to the coffee machine. I pull a shot of real coffee before heading to the shower.    10 minutes later I'm out of the shower, throw down another shot and get in the car.    In the car I drink the coffee that I've made for the trip.    When I get to work I have either an instant coffee or a diet coke depending on how I feel.  I then will have 2 or 3 more coffees before lunch - maybe one of those will be instant.    The afternoon is a slippery slope that rarely has coke or coffee out of my hands, but I'll admit it's normally too frantic to use the machine so it's instant all the way.

They paid me some small stipend and it disgusted me to see how much money is being wasted, there were several hundred people called and they used around 40 of us.  I won the lottery for one case but they objected to me. The lawyers decide based on how you look. lmfao, fucking ridic.

They have exactly zero chance to find any info on me.   Even if they have my electoral roll information it doesn't have anything important on there - whether I am fair minded, what my biases are nor how well I follow directions.   It doesn't have information on what my parents were like nor if I suffer from any mental illnesses.  Knowing what suburb I live in and what my current occupation means precisely dick.

brisbane,3d92o2,lubblylady,0,Thu Jul 16 03:10:15 2015 UTC,"The fact is you have no idea if why you were challenged off, so to say it was because of your looks is crazy. You didn't make it past empanelment, so you are not privy to the facts of the case.  If they have your AEC details (which they do, because that is how you get summoned) then they know of various ways your inclusion on a jury could interfere with the proper administration of justice.   For example, lets say you are a financial planner and someone robbed or assaulted a financial planner. An ordinary person would have bias. What if you are living in Bulimba and that is where a crime was committed? You may include your own knowledge of the area in determination of a verdict. This may seem common sense, but you might be bringing (potentially incorrect) facts into the decision that have not been properly examined by the defense and prosecution. There are of course other reasons why you may be challenged off.   Our criminal justice system is one of the best in the world. If you or someone you know believes they have been the victim of an unfair trial, seek a lawyer. The appeals system exists for this reason."

Where a juror is challenged the juror will not sit on the jury panel. The reasons that a particular person may be challenged by your defence lawyer or the crown are wide and varied. A crown may challenge a juror because they look like they may associate with the criminal element or they may want more male or female jurors on the jury panel. Your defence counsel may challenge a juror because of their attitude or apparent bias towards you.  Nothing written about access to your employment, but plenty of reference to random bias based on how you look.   You're a know-it-all and a pain in the arse.   Fuck off.

I was summoned two weeks ago, my occupation (student) was listed on my original summoning form. Can't attach the form right now as I am not at home, I could probably hunt it down for you when I get home.   I think counsel was right to challenge you off, you are clearly not very well adjusted. So the system works really..."
brisbane,3d92o2,horses_oh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:48:42 2015 UTC,"It is my belief that fair trials rarely happen anywhere, your reading comprehension and recall of facts are weak. You'd make a great lawyer /s . - luckily the chances of that happening are slim to none.  Law Graduate Unemployment Hits Record High  You really think they choose jurors based on anything but how they present themselves on the day?    You think they have both the time and inclination to thoroughly vet people?  Even if they are privy to your employment I say it still means nothing.  Let's say an accountant was murdered and you're also an accountant?   So? maybe you've only been an accountant for a few weeks, or maybe you're a new grad and have never even found a job?  What if you're a dog groomer and your father was an accountant? How would they know this? They can't know, they really can't know shit about you.   Which is my whole point.  All that matters is:  if you are fair,   how conscientious you are and   how well you follow directions.   All of which is a coin toss when you've got fewer than 30 seconds to evaluate how someone looks.  I reiterate, if you are going to go up against the criminal 'justice' system of any country, you better start fighting for yourself when the cops are making their first enquiries.   If you want to rely on a jury to sort the shit out then I would be extremely concerned, it is extremely worrying that anyone would consider this as an option."
brisbane,3d92o2,lubblylady,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:04:11 2015 UTC,"Man you are pretty funny to argue with. You are totally deluded. I wouldn't be so candid and rude usually, but you raised the bar with your unsolicited abuse.   You originally argued the system wasted money and that they only make a decision on your potential bias on your looks alone. Regarding the latter point, they use your occupation off your electoral information and off the information you provide on your summons (your electoral information does indeed have your occupation and age) so on that point you are wrong. Obviously this information cannot be used to determine too much about your personality (I have no idea why you typed all that stuff out RE dog groomers etc, it is pretty self evident), but since you are arguing the system is wasting money, I have no idea how you expect them to learn more about you without being even more expensive. They are effectively using information already provided to the state to save time and money.    I reiterate, if you are going to go up against the criminal 'justice' system of any country, you better start fighting for yourself when the cops are making their first enquiries.    No you didn't, you said ""FYI, fair trials rarely happen, it's the police investigation you need to be wary of as a citizen."" Nothing about location or country. Fair trials are very much the norm, and I would go so far as to say QPS are awesome as well.    If you want to rely on a jury to sort the shit out then I would be extremely concerned, it is extremely worrying that anyone would consider this as an option.   Literally never said that or anything to that effect. Since Queensland has Legal Aid to assist accused people with the costs associated with legal representation, self-representation in serious criminal trials is ridiculous. Anyway, juries don't ""sort shit out,"" they are the judges of fact. That you would think otherwise further proves your lack of understanding of our legal system.   All this aside, I will agree with you on one thing. I do believe you were probably challenged off due to your looks. Just from this conversation, you very clearly lack any critical thinking skills and you are quick to make assumptions off information you lack. Your challenging off was a fantastic call by the bench. That you would stoop so low as to research my potential career outcomes is equal parts funny and worrying, though I am sure you will be stoked to know that I already have a grad job lined up (just one more thing you are wrong about!)."

Provided they don't yet have enough jury members, and no one calls out 'objection' during your walk, then you're in. Some people walk very fast over to the bailiff.   You can also remove yourself from the jury before the trial starts. Once the jury is selected, they tell you the nature of the case, and then you can tell the judge you don't want to do it."

It was the beginning of January, very few cases being heard. The accused did a no-show so we all got to go home, receiving something like $40 for our time. Didn't get called in for any more in that period.  And the second time was just over a year ago. I got put on a panel, with the case lasting five days. Some bloke got busted using a pawnbroker to take out loans on stolen property. Long story short they were trying to pin the thefts of the goods on him as well, but lacked evidence. He was only only found guilty of possession and fraud.   Interesting to see it all in action, having never experienced any court stuff personally but I can't say I would bother doing it again if I had a way to get out of it.

I haven't done the Rainforest Circuit so can't comment on that.  I would suggest the 2km walk in the Boondall Wetlands, it's super flat with graded gravel paths which should be easy with a pram. (http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/environment-waste/natural-environment/bushland-parklands-wetlands/natural-areas/reserves-wetlands-parklands-forests/boondall-wetlands/boondall-wetlands-track-map)  Otherwise there is the Tinchi Tamba wetlands walks which has some nice views and includes a nice track and boardwalks.

brisbane,3d35h2,ponte92,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:07:47 2015 UTC,"Very true, I think its because I lived there during the start of myki which was the worlds great and most expensive fuck up so now I just associate it with being bad.

brisbane,3d3zle,billybale,2,Tue Jul 14 00:05:25 2015 UTC,even in the CBD it can be cheap. i go to QUT - when i drive in it's for lectures or tutes in the evening and never park for more than 2.5 hours and it costs me $8. it also means i don't sie for 40 mins waiting on a bus - i can be home before the bus even leaves the city

I caught the train into Liverpool (Merseyrail) 4 times and 2 out of the four were cancelled before it reached my stop (4 stops own the line from it's start of service). The other two were late running. I've only twice had a train been late or cancelled in Brisbane in 4 years and those were due to storms. I catch the trains pretty regularly here too.  When I lived in the UK, every other Merseyrail train was late or cancelled (I travelled every day on them). The ironic thing being that during this last trip, it was announced that Merseyrail are the most punctual train operator in the UK.  In summary, Brisbane trains are definitely better than the UK in my experience."

If we only had to maintain tracks from even Caboolture - Beenleigh - Ipswich the costs would be lower and service probably a lot better.  But we don't.    So comparing us to Europe is bunkum."
brisbane,3d3zle,Miniminotaur,-1,Mon Jul 13 21:41:27 2015 UTC,I don't see it about distance. It's infrastructure and cost. The gov doesn't spend enough money on it here.

I personally like moka pots or a french press as they are simple and make brilliant coffee plus don't take up a lot of space so something like espro press ($80) is my best recommendation in that area.   Pair that with a good milk frother, you will still come under price a lot compared barista style coffee machine and produce coffee that is equal to quality.

brisbane,3d4lfr,florexium,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:47:36 2015 UTC,"The curve in the road is the main culprit. There's frequently 3+ buses queueing up, and the curve causes major visibility issues, including not being able to see the number of the bus and not being able to hail the driver until the last second (at which point you better hope that the driver is paying attention to you and not the (usually awful) traffic that they have to merge into after the stop).  It also causes minor issues such as nobody knowing where to stand and not knowing if you should wait at the lead stop or run up to the second/third bus in line while it's stopped. Obvious these aren't the biggest problems in the world, but all of the above factors combine to make it far more likely that you're going to miss your bus even though you're standing right there."

brisbane,3d2ewb,danwincen,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:31:51 2015 UTC,"Anti-virus software is generally useless with emails. It only helps with attachments and old school POP mailboxes.  Your main defence here is mail filtering and some common knowledge. If you're living in the 21st century and have an IMAP account, your email is stored on a mail server which is in control of filtering and defending itself (on the mail hosts side of things). If you're using an old POP server or ISP/Carrier supplied crap like Bigpond, iiNet, Optusnet, etc. email, I'd be more concerned and you'd probably have to tighten the filters yourself.  Apple has an excellent article on identifying phishing/scam email. Almost all of it is general information and not specific to Apple users (e.g. I'm a Windows and Android person)  https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT204759"

brisbane,3d3fui,Sproner,7,Mon Jul 13 05:24:55 2015 UTC,"Depends what you want out of a drone really. Regardless, start with a micro quad and learn the basics of flying. I started with a Blade Nano QX which is a great little flyer, you can use self leveling mode to get started and switch to full acrobatic mode once you're more confident. Then you need to decide if you want something for floating around and doing aerial photgraphy, or something for going nuts fast and FPV racing. There's a facebook page called FPV QLD that has a great community for getting advice and meeting local flyers, they're also going to be the best help regarding legalities and licensing. To buy your first micro quad I'd suggest going to see OzRC, or Mild 2 Wild (both brisbane based), but when it comes time to get into a ""real"" quad there isn't a great deal of support at the local shops, your best bet is to start looking for online vendors. Again the FPV QLD group can point you in the right direction."
brisbane,3d3fui,MoonUnit,2,Mon Jul 13 06:00:56 2015 UTC,"So we're going go-carting in a few weeks, where we planned on dressing up as Mario Kart characters.   We want to wear GoPro's, but thought it would be awesome to get someone down with a drone to record too. The end game is to have heaps of footage to edit in Mario Kart special effects.  Is this awesome idea of ours a possibility? Would the track permit someone flying a drone around? Or can u only fly them in certain places.  As you can see, I know nothing about drones, and also like to get a little stoned sometimes."
brisbane,3d3fui,Some1stolemyspacebar,4,Mon Jul 13 06:56:35 2015 UTC,"All good mate, you gotta ask questions to learn. To be honest I'd suggest this idea is a no go with the time frame you've got, for several reasons. You're not supposed to fly over crowds of people or within 30m of buildings, unless you have permits AND insurance cover to do otherwise. The best quad for what you're describing (as much as I hate them) is probably a DJI Phantom with a gopro strapped underneath it, that's not a cheap rig to start with. While they're basically idiot proof to fly, you're not going to have the time to learn to ""properly"" fly it without the GPS position hold and all the other assists, so if something went wrong mid flight and you actually had to control the thing manually you'd be pretty screwed. Never ever rely on assists to keep you in the air, if/when they fail you need to be able to safely recover control and land it all on your own.   Finally, don't let this put you off flying! Get a micro quad and get learning, they're an absolute blast and once you've got a few solid weeks of practice under your belt you'll be ready to try some of the larger/cooler quads."
brisbane,3d3fui,MoonUnit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:42:16 2015 UTC,"So how do things like the zano (http://www.flyzano.com/) get approved, then? Or are they not legal in Aus?"
brisbane,3d3fui,phranticsnr,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:07:22 2015 UTC,"The responsibility lies with the operator, there's no reason you can't use that quad safely and responsibly. Same as you can buy a car that does 200km/h, you as the driver are expected to adhere to the laws :)  The quad/drone hobby is absolutely exploding at the moment, and while cases of people being fined for misuse are VERY rare I'd rather educate new users about responsible flying. Otherwise accidents and injuries will occur causing councils and governments to police the shit out of the hobby, and ruin it for everyone."

brisbane,3d2mp3,OzRockabella,6,Mon Jul 13 00:59:00 2015 UTC,"If we are talking about Seligman's PERMA version of Positive Psychology, then no.  One could argue that parts of the model draw on the work of cognitive therapy, but in many ways it is quite divergent. Instead of focusing on restructuring/reducing negative thoughts (as in CBT), Positive Psychology is about focusing on expanding positive thoughts and experiences. It has had considerable success, so much so that the US defense force have made it apart of a program to prevent PTSD and instead cultivate PTG. Some schools in Australia have also started to embed it in their curriculum."

I've been getting back into a lot of old great bands I've dug up through Last.fm (add me!) and Spotify. Some greats:   Jakob - awesome ambient post-rock from NZ.  Mindsnare - One of my favourite hardcore/thrash crossover bands and one of my favourite bands in general. Some of the best riffs ever - like Slayer, Agnostic Front and Pantera in a high-tempo knife fight. 11/10 Barren Earth - Incredible death/doom supergroup with melodic choruses and even power metal influences.  Mercenary and Pagan's Mind - Two awesome and more 'traditional' heavy metal/prog bands with an ambient and power metal influence. Mistress - Now-defunct sludgy thrashy awesomeness, check out In Disgust We Trust.   I got more for yo' asses if you're interested and I'd love to hear any suggestions. Rock on and have a good Monday. \m/ >.< \m/"

brisbane,3cxs6x,CantPressThis,8,Sat Jul 11 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"Mountain waves occur when a moderately strong wind passes over a mountain range. The air rises on the windward side of the range then descends after it goes over the range. If the conditions are right, the rising and falling motion can continue well downwind of the ranges. Sometimes extending for 30-50 miles or so. These waves can't be seen most of the time (there are some exceptions). So you can be flying along fat, dumb and happy. Then, with no warning, you are in a massive up drought or down drought or even worse a rotor (large, invisible mass or rotating air) and all hell breaks loose. Best case scenario: A very bumpy ride. Sick/terrified passengers and cleaning out my boxers. Worse case scenario: Massive forces on the helicopter beyond its design limits resulting in an in flight breakup of the machine."

One (from Switch) went on to FM commercial radio in Darwin for a few years. Last known to be working in a Melbourne call centre.   Another (from Pulse) died while incarcerated"

brisbane,3cxnhv,penelopee_poops,3,Sun Jul 12 00:33:14 2015 UTC,"I love Switch 1197! And Switch Digital. Listen to the web streams at work a lot. Shame they aren't FM anymore, as AM sounds absolutely terrible on my car stereo. Tempted to get a Digital DAB+ radio purely to listen to Switch while driving, as commercial FM stations can be very yuck at times (when every second song they play is by Taylor bloody Swift :/)."

brisbane,3cxnhv,MikeEchoOscarWhisky,4,Sat Jul 11 18:48:37 2015 UTC,"It's a long story. I'll try to tell the short version.   The stations on 97.3fm were all aspirant community broadcasters, using the license temporarily to prove their capacity to operate a community radio station. There were two permanent community radio licences up for grabs (96.5fm and 1197am) with 6 (from memory) organisations applying. Not everybody could be a winner in that arrangement. 96.5fm was awarded to Family Radio (Christians). Switch got the last remaining licence - 1197am. Switch was the only youth broadcaster in Brisbane to get a permanent licence.   Why are they now barely surviving and nowhere near as successful? Pretty much the obvious - they are on AM. They are bound by their licence conditions to provide a radio service oriented to youth. Targeting young people on AM is obviously not a recipe for resounding popularity. A noble not for profit cause for sure, but not a financially successful one."
brisbane,3cxnhv,s13_eisbaer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:26:11 2015 UTC,"Wow. That's really kind of sad. Did the Christians just have more cash to put down on the table, or was the awarding of their FM licence based on other factors?"
brisbane,3cxnhv,ticman,2,Sun Jul 12 07:17:46 2015 UTC,"No reason was given officially. The Christians had been test broadcasting on various temporary licenses for over 20 years. In that time they had invested quite a bit into FM technology and claimed that a move to AM would be too costly. This may have had some bearing on the decision.   However youth radio stations in Syd and Melb had been causing some big headaches for the licensing authority around the time all this was happening. There's a theory that as a result, they were wary of allowing another youth station onto a popular frequency and possibly increasing their workload as a result.   Of course, the Christians were pretty well cashed up. If you were going to suggest that some cash might have been slipped into the right hands, you wouldn't be the first to say so"
brisbane,3cxnhv,D_Beaverhausen,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:20:52 2015 UTC,I was the morning announcer on 97.3 for Wild FM then for a short time in the afternoons at SwitchFM for the drive home. I also did all the outside broadcasts from the nightclubs. Oh the memories..
