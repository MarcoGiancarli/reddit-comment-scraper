Bitcoin,3e1lul,directTrade,3,Tue Jul 21 15:12:18 2015 UTC,I am more optimistic. Each of these steps has added one more degree of decentralisation.

As for anonymous, it certainly doesn't have to be the case that arbitrators are anonymous.   For these so called decentralized exchanges, we have to trust some common party... and there it fails.

Also not really, you can exchange fiat on several platforms OR actual money (cash) against Localbitcoin BTC-denominated balances/IOUs that you might or might not be able to redeem.   ...and especially a much more resilient one, that cannot be taken down or regulated into irrelevance.   Those multiple payment processors verly likely will have to be heavily regulated and can freeze accounts, cancel transactions, refuse to transact or refuse to pay out at will or at the whim of a regulative body."

As long as you're not banking in Greece at the moment.  I live in the Netherlands and a SEPA transaction is practically unreversible. Theoretically it might be, but you can use a SEPA safely.  European banks will sometimes block a transaction to protect against theft, but if it goes through it's unrealistic to worry about the transaction being cancelled."
Bitcoin,3e1lul,jerguismi,4,Tue Jul 21 08:52:54 2015 UTC,"Netherlands might be a place where SEPA transfers are blocked very rarely.

""Sepa can be used safely to receive money.""  For common/normal use, yes. For bitcoin trading, I wouldn't agree.

However it is still technically possible if OKPay guys decide that they want to reverse some payments (they try to guarantee you that they never want that). With bitcoin chargebacks aren't techically possible. My point was to demonstrate the difference, as the marketing speak often doesn't make the distinction very clear."
Bitcoin,3e1lul,notreddingit,4,Tue Jul 21 09:33:17 2015 UTC,iDeal is for companies (like Bitonic.nl already using). Not for P2P exchanging.
Bitcoin,3e1lul,fcktheussa,4,Tue Jul 21 08:25:52 2015 UTC,"Lots of interbank instant domestic transfers are effectively non-reversible. Not like Bitcoin is trustless and non-reversible, but they're not like credit cards that can easily be charged back. And if you get scammed the chances of recovering your money are close to zero and they specifically warn you when you send money not to send to people you don't know because if it's a scam you're out of luck.  For an example of this in action compare the spreads on different countries 'national bank transfers' on Localbitcoins to trades with Paypal(which of course we all know is reversible). You'll notice that the national bank transfers option tends to have the lowest spreads, implying the least risk. While Paypal has extremely high spreads so traders can attempt to offset the fraud they'll inevitably run in to.   I'll note that Americans don't have any sort of national bank transfer system now, as it comes up often in these discussions.  And while different countries will have different policies, in my experience national bank transfers have been the most secure way for people to trade Bitcoin. I'm sure they're not perfect, it's a big world and knowing banks I'm sure there are some horror stories out there. But the success of national bank transfers on Localbitcoins lends pretty good evidence that they tend to be a good way to trade BTC."

It seems to me they have come closer to making trustless fiat-crypto trading, but not so much decentralized - at least not yet.  Basically the way to solve the unsolvable is to cheat somehow. Bitcoin cheated in ""solving"" the Byzantine Generals problem, but it worked. Coinffeine's solution to the apparently intractable game theoretic problem was to assume that fiat could be made to behave like crypto (and indeed crypto-crypto decentralised trade is a more-or-less solved problem). They found a way to make a fast fiat micropayments channel with zero or low fees. The tradeoff was that they had to find a specific provider that would give them that, and it is (so far) OKPay. To use OKPay, from my investigations, you have to have a verified account with them (except maybe for very small amounts?).   I wonder if it'll get much traction. Most people don't really want to use OKPay, don't want to give them ID details etc. It's noticeable that not much localbitcoins trade is done over OKPay. Could we get other payment services offering something similar? That would help with the decentralization, but it's the same old story: the only thing stopping businesses from offering cheap, frictionless instant digital transfer of money is the same good old regulation that makes trading via banks such a pain."

(can't beleive paypal will not seize their account)  Will this be more convenient than localbitcoins.  Are your coins stored in their system at any time and for how long or are they stored on a wallet you control compleletely.  Whats the incentive for oitsides to run p2p nodes.   Can the p2p reference portal nodes be taken down like thepiratebay is  occassionally.  This could be a big breakthrough depending on the answers to those questions.

I believe this is only partially true. By avoiding accepting deposits and KYC/AML checks they basically outsource this process, along with all related risks, to their users. They only do the matchmaking and have their hands clean - it's the users who conduct transactions.  So you're an user and want to sell bitcoins for fiat. You send your bitcoins and you accept a money transfer from someone you don't know. Everything goes smoothly, you're happy with the service and you join all these people calling the exchange amazing. Then few months later you have FBI agents at your door because you accepted dirty money and essentially helped launder this money.  Thanks, but no thanks."

How can Bitcoin be the killer app when it can only do 8 million transactions per month? When it relies on future vaporware like Lightning and Sidechains to match competitive processing speeds?  At 2.7 transactions per second max it's a joke to call bitcoin a killer app.   https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd  https://blockchain.info/charts/trade-volume  Transaction volume doesn't appear to have increased much at all in the last year  The stress test basically simulated the volume of less than 1% of Walmart stores accepting Bitcoin, and it caused day-long delays or otherwise raised the fees for everybody to have a transaction processed in the same time. Now imagine this effect magnified by the entire world - with intensive wide-adoption use bitcoin is no longer competitively priced or fast. This ""killer app"" doesn't scale and that's why people talk about stuff like LN and Sidechains - because Bitcoin itself is woefully inadequate to be a world-wide ledger despite everybody rambling for the past two years that people should use the blockchain for everything"

This things tend to work themselves out, we as a community will arrive at a consensus at to what the solution has to be.   IMHO we should be focusing on adoption not be so worried about txn speed.

Bitcoin,3e2slh,rnvk,-7,Tue Jul 21 15:51:44 2015 UTC,"I can send 100K across the pond without permission from my bank.   No, you can send an amount of Bitcoins worth (for some short period of time) exactly $100k....  ...Then the person on the other end has to find somewhere to spend or cash out $100k worth of Bitcoins, almost certainly involving a linked bank account. You also likely involved a bank when first purchasing those Bitcoins, unless you are a lucky early adopter or otherwise bought $100k worth of BTC on localbitcoins   we should be focusing on adoption not be so worried about txn speed   For a prominent bitcoin user, it strikes me as odd you can't correlate these two.   Wider adoption means slower Bitcoin service for everybody, as demonstrated by the stress test. The more users you dogpile on to bitcoin's limited blockchain the longer all those users wait for cheap transactions or the more those users pay for fast ones. The ""rising waters"" of transaction fees already reared their head during last week's stress test. Transactions going from five cents to 25 cents may not seem like a big deal but again, that's not indicative of actual worldwide adoption. You get tens or hundreds of millions of people using Bitcoins and suddenly it's neither cheaper nor faster than other remittance options.   Maintaining a fast and cheap transaction speed should be paramount right now, since new users aren't going to be attracted to a slow and expensive-at-scale system like ""killer app"" Bitcoin   When I started using BBSes from Brazil   This isn't the internet in 1995, this is modern-day. Useful technologies are adopted by hundreds of millions of people overnight, it's not that a bunch of luddites have failed to recognize the usefulness of Bitcoins, it's that a bunch of people recognize bitcoin offers no benefits beyond their current systems and those people it does benefit will not see the same benefits at scale."

If bitcoin is expected to go ""to the moon"", then my assumption would be that usage and transactions would increase at the same rate as the $/BTC increase (or at least some increase; and I realize price and transactions are not directly linked).  If that is true, and the stress test was an accurate representation of the current systems capability, it is going to be extremely difficult to get to the dreams of $10,000/BTC or more.  On a side note, I read once that the block difficulty is there purely as a way to manage the solutions to 1 block every 10 minutes, and the the computing power could easily handle just the transactions.  Is it possible to lower the difficulty in order to process more transactions and still stay within the 10 minute target?  Is this what would be happening if the block size was increased from 1MB?"
Bitcoin,3e2slh,Gracie_BJJ,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:47:13 2015 UTC,Increasing block size does not affect the mining difficulty for the miners. Increasing block size requires more hard drive space as well as bandwidth for the nodes
