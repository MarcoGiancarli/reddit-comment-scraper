Bass,3e3g91,brentathen,6,Tue Jul 21 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"If I want treble-y, I dime everything. If I want even treble-y-er, I turn down the neck pickup.  In super simplified terms, the neck pickup gives you more bass frequency than anything, and the bridge pickup gives you more treble frequency than anything. Turning down the tone knob cuts your high end.  I'd say 75% of the time I'm playing with everything cranked, then I adjust to suit the specific part I'm playing."
Bass,3e3g91,stevexc,3,Tue Jul 21 18:08:28 2015 UTC,"and if you want treble-y-er-er, play with your right hand as comfortably close to the bridge as you can"

Bass,3e3g91,SoundLogIcalReasonIn,3,Tue Jul 21 19:58:49 2015 UTC,"Tone 75% usually.  Neck and bridge at about 90%.  I find that with the pickups maxed it blows out the tone too much.  With the heavy fuzz I like, it sounds more fuzzy when you back them off a bit."
Bass,3e3g91,NecessaryMutilation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:06:29 2015 UTC,"I usually run the bass and treble pickups all the way up (in series) and i fiddle with the tone knob based on the genre Im playing (Psych/Garage is bassy, Jazz is trebley)"
Bass,3e3g91,dragoliger22,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:59:46 2015 UTC,"So...dime everything and then start backing off the neck (bass) pickup until you like what you hear. Then tweak the sound further with the tone nob.  I prefer a dimmed jazz bass with both pickups and tone nob full.  But there as so many different Jazz basses out there with different pickups (given year and model) as well as tone circuits (VOl, VOl, TONE; VOL, VOL, TONE, TONE, etc) that just because it sounds good on my Jazz Bass doesn't mean its going to sound good on yours.  But to help give you some ideas check you this video comparing a bunch of different Fender Jazz Basses with different pickup settings and pick vs finger. (but make sure you use headphones or good speakers to really hear the difference).   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGyrGTuMhzo"
Bass,3e3g91,Waldo19,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:05:04 2015 UTC,So like 8 on the neck and full on the bridge and tone would be a good setting?
Bass,3e3g91,Waldo19,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:45:49 2015 UTC,"maybe. you just gotta try it and see what you like.  my Jazz is a 90's MIM so its got very different pickups (relatively speaking) then on current or vintage Jazz basses.   The most important thing to understand is that your bridge pickup has more of a treble tone because of its location. So the more you emphasize that pickup (either turning it up, or the neck pickup down) the more trebly your sound is going to be.  In addition the higher your tone setting, the more highs you are going to get (which again adds treble to your sound).    But you are going to have to fool around to find the sweat-spot for your bass and amp.  I can tell you that 10, 8, 8 (Neck, Bridge, Tone) sounds great, but maybe on your bass (10, 7,9) is what sounds best."

Bass,3e3g91,acepiloto,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:30:42 2015 UTC,"Dimed all around usually for most songs. I back off the bridge pickup about 10% or so on country gigs, gives it more of a thump. Only on songs in which I need a more muted, uprightish tone will I even mess with the tone control."
Bass,3e3g91,cybersnyder,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:27 2015 UTC,Most of the time I just dime everything and let it sound like a jazz.

I haven't played my jazz live in a long time because of microphonic pickups not meshing well with distortion pedals I tend to use a lot. I had the bridge pickup potted and it helped, but I need to get the neck done too and it should be good to go. Still need to get around to that..."

Bass,3e4pvf,TheFrozenEmpire,3,Tue Jul 21 23:01:13 2015 UTC,"As a bassist, guitarist and pianist, I cannot recommend pursuing more than one instrument enough. By doing so, you enable yourself to look at the bass in an entirely new light, and have much more of an insight on what the rest of your band, should you choose to play in a group, is doing. From my experience as guitarist, I find it much easier to accompany others when playing bass as well as find melodic lines even in the low register of the instrument. Of course, this is a person decision, but learning the guitar certainly wouldn't hinder any current progress you've made. I find that learning multiple instruments doesn't necessarily prevent me from focussing on each of them individually, but rather allows me to practice fully on each consecutively, looking forward to their differences."
Bass,3e4pvf,Marcus_Z,2,Tue Jul 21 23:53:35 2015 UTC,"It depends what your goals are, but honestly I think that the more instruments you can play the better. If your plan is to be a live musician you'll end up with more stage time if you can fill in on mandolin, keys, or trumpet than if you can only play a bass. If you want to be a home musician and you don't really have an interest in bands it helps to be able to play your own drums or guitars should you want to start recording your own compositions some day.  That said there's nothing wrong with keeping your focus on bass for the time being. While you're still breathing the opportunity to pursue new instruments never expires, so if you want to get a better bass and focus on being a bassist then you're not going to come to any musical harm."

Bass,3e4w1e,techn0guy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:50:45 2015 UTC,"Have you maybe looked into getting a small little analog mixer? I know this isn't exactly what you're asking, but getting a little 2 channel mixer with a headphone output that you can run your bass and laptop into is by far the easiest solution I've found to this problem. It'll set you back $40 or so, but IMO it's worth it. No chance for audio lag, simple setup, and you can run your phone through it instead of your laptop if you're traveling light."
Bass,3e4w1e,musical_bear,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:15:42 2015 UTC,Download the free version of Amplitube 3 and run that as an application on your computer. It'll give you an audible tone through your primary output device (headphones probably) with a limited selection of bass amps and you can then put on any other music source and it should work in tandem.

Bass,3e1oy6,Myksee,9,Tue Jul 21 07:28:29 2015 UTC,"In general - it's not bad in any serious, damaging way. However, constant differences in neck tensions due to tune changes can, and probably will, cause more curve so you will need to setup your instrument more often. Truss rod adjustment etc."
Bass,3e1oy6,Alabastrova,3,Tue Jul 21 07:36:44 2015 UTC,"I plan on learning songs in standard, drop A, B, and D.   On the same bass with the same set of strings? I assume you're talking about a 4-string? That just ain't gonna work. Usually you can drop-tune as low as C# or maybe C and even then you often get a 'floppy' tone (which is not bad, but it's different and should be something you are going for). On one of my basses even drop D doesn't sound good anymore.   You could buy a set of strings that are made to be tuned to B E A D (the first 4 strings of a 5-string) and switch between B E A D and A D G C, but you can't tune those up to E A D G (the tension on the neck would be too high)."
Bass,3e1oy6,Nohoshi,3,Tue Jul 21 12:57:34 2015 UTC,"What kind of bass do you have, 4 or 5 string? You cannot do drop A or B on a 4 string. You can do drop D. A and B are too low of tunings to work on a typical 95-105 gauge E string. If you have a 5 string then B is the typical tuning of the fifth string and drop A is completely practical."
Bass,3e1oy6,jrhallman,3,Tue Jul 21 15:04:19 2015 UTC,"Drop D and standard are no problem to swap between really (people who are very finicky about their gear might disagree, but it certainly won't fuck up your neck or anything).  Drop b and a are getting into the territory of wonky.  Changing to those tunings mean you are tuning all your strings down 1.5 and 2.5 steps respectively (I think I counted that right, it's early, sue me).  That is a pretty significant change to neck tension and would likely require a total readjustment of the instrument to maintain intonation and playability.  Plus drop A is going to sound like fart on a 4 string.  Unless you get some extra thick strings it'll sound all floppy and muddy and feel pretty loose.  You can do it, but you'd definitely need an instrument set up for drop A specifically to have a chance of making it sound good.  A 5 string will serve you much better for drop B and A.  for example, on my guitars I have a 2 setup differently.  One for standard and one for drop C.  Changing from standard to drop C was enough of a difference that I felt the need to have a separate setup for it, and that was only 1 step below drop D.  A and B are significantly lower, and fret buzz will be a much bigger issue on bass than on guitar as well as getting a ""fart"" tone that I mentioned earlier.  EDIT: TLDR: Sure, swap between drop D and standard, it's fine.  For drop B and A you're gonna need a separate setup with different (read: thicker) strings or a 5 string for it to sound ok."
Bass,3e1oy6,SomeKindaJerk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:21:00 2015 UTC,"""drop a/b/d"" means just the E-string is tuned down, right? I think if you set it up right, it should be ok, maybe? you'd need a bigger (in terms of gauge I mean) E-string, probably. Also, dropping the E-String will increase tension over the other 3 strings, so maybe there's some kind of torque which may over time warp the neck a bit; or more crucially, that twisting force would be different depending on your E-string's pitch. I don't know if that's enough to cause problems, though. I took the low B-string off my 5-string bass, and it didn't make a whole lot of difference in terms of setup. (I did set it up fresh later, but not because I noticed any particular problem that I could trace back to taking off the B-string.)  If you're talking about tuning the whole bass down, I don't even think it's necessarily bad for the bass, but it seems near impossible to me to have a setup (action, bridge heights, intonation, etc) that will sound/play great with that big of a range.  I'd buy or borrow a 2nd cheapish bass and tune that down, if it's an option."
Bass,3e1oy6,apaeter,2,Tue Jul 21 14:32:23 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a job for a low B string, no re-tuning necessary (well, you'd still have to drop to the A, I guess)."

Bass,3e1oy6,ChuckEye,2,Tue Jul 21 13:30:03 2015 UTC,"If he does string changes like that, it probably has more to do with maintaining a bright tone (for harmonics) than for actual damage or breaking of strings."
