deephouse,3e2zrr,CoachZ420,2,Tue Jul 21 18:08:20 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I would call this deep house, but Darius is dope. Does anyone know of any artists with a similar sound?"
deephouse,3e2zrr,ThunderFap26,3,Wed Jul 22 02:22:24 2015 UTC,"Ben Macklin, Cajoline, LeMarquis, Le Flex, Le Crayon, Oxford, JackLNDN... just going off the top of my head. These artists have that same smooth yet funky sound similar to Darius ""IMO"""

deephouse,3e4cfd,alim_786,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:22:59 2015 UTC,Maybe Alex Smoke or Mikkel Metal. They both do that sultry downtempo stuff perfect for chillin at home. But I'm talking the stuff from early 2000's
deephouse,3e4cfd,thewebsiteguy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:26:44 2015 UTC,This is a mix; not one individual song. The dude has included the tracklist so have a look at the other work of the artists he's included.

deephouse,3dya7g,ThxBungie,2,Mon Jul 20 23:09:56 2015 UTC,Too.. safe and generic.

deephouse,3dy022,Tardigrade1,3,Mon Jul 20 13:36:11 2015 UTC,"Kaytranada basically makes a genre-bending house-influenced R&B. Most of his songs hover at around 115 BPM, which is under House's usual range of 120-130 BPM. The closest track of his to House is Leave Me Alone (feat Shay Lia)--it's in South African Deep / Soulful House territory (see Black Coffee, Culoe De Song, or Boddhi Satva).  For a house track that reminds me of what Kaytranada would make if he made house, see Duke Dumont - The Giver (Fono Remix)."

deephouse,3dy022,aidandeno,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:19 2015 UTC,I'm not sure what kind of music genre it is but it defenitly isn't Shallow house.  He produces a wide variety of music deephouse/chill/nudisco and I even see some of his tracks on /r/futurefunkairlines
deephouse,3dy022,DaanBanaan,4,Mon Jul 20 16:06:48 2015 UTC,"deephouse/chill/nudisco   Dude produces garage, n-step, hip-hop and similar broken-beat type sound and has nothing to do with house."

deephouse,3dvxdw,seaniquar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:50:21 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who thinks the voice ruins the song? is there an instrumental anywhere?
deephouse,3dvxdw,youngsobe,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:28:39 2015 UTC,"I highly recommend that everyone on this sub listen to this whole album. It's called ""Rise"".   Preferably on a nice set of cans or great speakers.   It's truly wonderful from start to finish. Easily one of the most polished and thoughtfully mastered Electronic albums I've heard in a while."

deephouse,3dqpv2,wonderfulme,4,Sat Jul 18 15:13:38 2015 UTC,"SAMANTHA JAMES, you can thank me later!  Also, uptown by Aya *who also has many tracks with miguel migs!  EDIT: wow, sorry should have read the other comment..Jesus christ.  Honestly, dude, I'm obssessed with Migs and Lisa shaw, I've seen and met both of them numerous times, they are basically my main inspirations for making music.  With that being said, I can honestly say that there isn't much out there compared to her, I think AYA would be the closest bet. I didn't really understand your comment below about S.James (did you say you didn't like her?) anyways I think she's also really amazing, you should look into her more, specifically the tracks ""angel love"" and this breathe you in remix  Also, have you carefully listened to all of Lisa Shaw's albums and remixes? Cause there's almost a lifetime's worth out there. Here are two Lisa Shaw remixes I absolutely love:  Miguel Migs- Cherry  Chuck Love - Feel  Did you listen to the new Migs Cd ""Dim divison"" there are some good vocalists on there such as ""Gabrielle Walter-Clay"" who completly nails this track: Green light  I've also found that Richard Earnshaw makes tracks with females who have a similar vibe to Lisa Shaw but a little more Pop-ish sounding.  Anyways I hope this helped!   I'm just glad to see other people love Lisa shaw and the whole naked music vibe as much as I do."
deephouse,3dqpv2,willdill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:23:26 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't see it yet with Sam. She just ain't got that tint. She pretty much sounds all-around flat, but that's just from one youtube video. Will investigate.  I'm definitely with you ref Miguel, but he's not exactly a diva. Aya is fine, but not exactly on the level, just my opinion. Gal's fine, love her voice. Maybe she's not getting enough material.  I've listened to countless remixes and my favorites are probably Like I Want To (Fred Everything Vocal Mix), Let It Ride (Jimpster Remix), Andy Caldwell ft. Lisa Shaw - Warrior and probably a bunch of others.  Never got a chance to listen to Mig's newest CD, although I'm checking nakedmusic.com like once a year.  You surely provided a lot of keywords to explore. Thanks for that."

deephouse,3dqpv2,willdill,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:31:19 2015 UTC,"Aya is awesome, check out the song Uptown.   Obviously Miguel Migs, Samantha James. Older stuff from Trentemoller and Andy Caldwell, Jay-J and Micari, Joshua/Iz & Diz, Farina. Definitely go through the labels Large Music and OM, especially their releases from the early 2000s.   Edit: I'll post more as I start going through recrods.   The Rurals - West Side EP"

deephouse,3dqpv2,VEC7OR,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:38:16 2015 UTC,"Aya is Naked Music. I pretty much ate their catalog.  Looking to branch out. I love EBTG-like pre- and post-their transition into ""Temperamental"".  Basically, anything with memorable female vocals and and a beat to go with it.  Samantha James, from a random youtube search, seems like my cup of of tea, thanks for that. Will look into those other names."
