indianpeoplefacebook,3e26kc,DontMentionLobsters,5,Tue Jul 21 20:00:40 2015 UTC,"I'm very curious as to why these girls' stomachs are being chosen as the pinnacle of beauty. Yes, they're all skinny, but they're being praised for their bodies when they're not exactly bikini models either. Look at picture five and you can even see a little belly hanging over. Not saying that's unhealthy or disgusting, but Western culture certainly wouldn't be making memes about how perfect her body is."
indianpeoplefacebook,3e26kc,ryandinho14,30,Tue Jul 21 16:06:33 2015 UTC,It's almost like attractiveness is based on culture in many ways.  I've never seen anyone in the US suggest that tongue fucking someone's belly button for an hour would be pleasurable for anyone involved either.
indianpeoplefacebook,3e26kc,hithazel,7,Tue Jul 21 16:14:37 2015 UTC,"Perhaps my question was misphrased. I understand the various cultural factors that play in judging beauty, and that no  what I want to know is what exactly are those cultural factors. Is the navel normally hidden in Indian culture? Kind of like how Amazons don't get why Americans love tits."

indianpeoplefacebook,3d9733,Pashizzle,24,Tue Jul 14 16:18:59 2015 UTC,"Unless bicycle race is a function of time. Also, it should be a differential dt, not a finite delta t.   Also, I'm going to attempt to make sense out by stretching this really far by assuming (bicycle race / time) is a differential d(bicycle race)/d(time), and change deltat -> dt. In this case we have a definite integral, which would give us ""Sport = (Bicycle race win) - (Bicycle race loss) "" but since cycling is sport (cycling = sport) we come to the result ""Cycling = Sport = (Bicycle race win) - (Bicycle race loss)"" or in words, cycling can be summed up by adding all your wins and subtracting out your losses.

I honestly think it's more to do with them being unable to express themselves openly in India.The big cities ,to an extent have adapted to the westernization as we like to call it.It's when we talk about small/mid size towns that is when we start to see shit like that. I am not generalizing as in there are people from big cities sending messages like that and people from small towns with better social skills than anyone I have ever seen.  What I am trying to get at is the lack of inter-personal skills is the root cause , flamed by our so called culture."

I am going to assume that you are a grill.If you are not then bear with me .  What happens is that in small/ mid size towns guys and girls can't talk freely to the other sex.Their interaction remains to an extent limited to the same sex, hence the lack of them skills.   Imagine me talking to another dude who is a good friend. I would be say something like ""Hey wanna hang out ?"" He says no or ignores me , the next thing I say is ""Hey fuckwad , let's hang out"" or something like that.I am smart enough to know that when talking to your friends and when you are trying to court someone your language has to be different.   That is something they fail to learn. I hope this makes sense."

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue.

There was a brief time when it almost had a cult following. You probably loved it or hated it, but you nevertheless talked about it! I grew up watching it, finding it awesome as a kid, then growing up and being disappointed because I learned how science actually works, and now I'm back to enjoying it, like the naive child who loves to imagine that 'Zoom' works infinitely on a video footage shot by a VGA camera. It's been more than a decade now, and the script is mostly shitty, the characters are playing the same old cliched roles again and again and again, but I'd be lying if I say I don't love that stuff!"

Acp refused to play SHERLOCK HOLMES lead actor in the SHERLOCK HOLMES series which was based on and inspired by CID. He offered his roles to his friend Robert Downy Jr for the first SHERLOCK movie. CID is been a gem in the Indian TV and cinema. Many of the cast member refused Hollywood offers because of busy schedule and their love for CID. (Daya refused to do HULK in Avengers series). CID is better than CAI Miami, which is been a cheap ripoff."""

indianpeoplefacebook,39svhu,Jock_fortune_sandals,18,Sun Jun 14 23:00:07 2015 UTC,Is there any explanation as to why do many Indian guys are this weird?
indianpeoplefacebook,39svhu,Viper_ACR,44,Sun Jun 14 21:57:25 2015 UTC,"On the mod team, we explain it like this:   Cultural differences also add to the confusion. Many Desi men grew up in a pre-sexual revolution society (the Indian subcontinent still has to go through the 1960s, when it comes to attitudes towards sex and relationships). Indian society is quite sexually repressed, and for many Indian men, Facebook is one of their first encounters with the openness of Western culture when it comes to revealing pictures and women sharing intimate details of their own lifes. Understandeably, a lot of them don't take any second chances when they see a nice Western girl with -for their standards- revealing clothes, so they drop a message and hope for the best.

indianpeoplefacebook,39svhu,Jock_fortune_sandals,15,Sun Jun 14 23:53:09 2015 UTC,"To be fair, not every brown guy is like this. I've met quite a few brown people that grew up in India and most of them are normal people. Then again, Indian fobs I've met are pretty well educated."

indianpeoplefacebook,39svhu,geobloke,7,Mon Jun 15 02:05:07 2015 UTC,"A project manager I used to work with did a lot of work in India a while back, with lots of Indian software devs.  Basically they have a very warped view of western women because these ones would watch a pretty serious amount of internet porn, he would basically walk into the office and they would say ""I'm going to get myself an Australian woman to marry like what you have"", and would be just going through his porn image collection at work.  I'm not saying that's the case for all of them, but this guy appears to be pretty similar to what he had to work with."
indianpeoplefacebook,39svhu,_a_n_,9,Mon Jun 15 03:20:06 2015 UTC,Maybe cause there's a lot more guys than girls in India?

indianpeoplefacebook,39b8dl,k3rstman1,15,Thu Jun 11 10:43:12 2015 UTC,Native language input methods (until pretty recently) sucked harder than a tornado. Still not that good when compared to English Most learn only a little English

indianpeoplefacebook,39b8dl,k3rstman1,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:05:34 2015 UTC,Yeah but I also see lots of posts on their own wall in english.  English isn't my first language either and it woul be weird if someone who speaks the same native language as me would suddenly talk in english to me.
indianpeoplefacebook,39b8dl,Hachiiiko,11,Thu Jun 11 11:13:17 2015 UTC,"There are more than 20 official languages in India, and English is probably the second most used in professional communications. Only about 25% of the Indian population actually speak Hindi, many more speak dialects and languages that are so different from Hindi they are often mutually unintelligible. Besides Hindi and English, there's Bengali, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Gujarati, Punjabi, Nepali, Marathi, Urdu, and more!  A leftover from 335 years of British colonial rule in India is that most people speak English at at least a conversational level. Especially considering that what seem like random bastardisations and incorrect word orders to you, might seem completely logical if you also speak a language that would put the words in that order.  Short answer: people in India speak a shit-ton of different native languages and English crosses those borders, not in the least because of good ol' Western imperialism."

Hell, to a lot of my friends, there is absolutely zero presence of family or work colleagues on FB. A lot of people are on FB on alternate accounts and simply chat with their 4-5 friends and strangers.  The idea of a website conflating with real life is still bizarre to them. Online world and offline world are two separate entitities. Which is why a lot of people say things they would never say to anyone IRL. It's basically 4chan/omegle for many of us."

indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,rebel_nature,12,Fri Jun 5 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"Op did tell the guy she wasn't interested, he didn't back off, she pranked him...no harm done imo"
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,occasional_villain,3,Fri Jun 5 19:36:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can totally receive messages from people you're not friends with.   For instance, a couple weeks ago, a fifteen year old from West Virginia accused me of dating her thirteen  year old boyfriend. I've never even been to West Virginia, I'm 22 and in a serious relationship. And we didn't even have mutual friends. I don't even know how she found me."

indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,Moirawr,1 point,Fri Jun 5 19:17:36 2015 UTC,Same here. And for mildly the same reasons too! I also post things that generate a lot of discussion and debate and I keep it public so I can read all the ideas.
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,rebel_nature,2,Fri Jun 5 19:22:52 2015 UTC,I didn't accept his friend request.
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,Moirawr,7,Fri Jun 5 18:49:34 2015 UTC,"Cruel but entertaining. Shouldn't have dragged it out though, that guy actually does need help. One the other hand, she gave him MANY chances to back off and sent pretty clear signals she wasn't interested. Idk how its possible to not pick up on that.  Favorite part was probably how he loves all the ""sweet memories"" you have."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,rebel_nature,6,Fri Jun 5 17:42:32 2015 UTC,"It wasn't really that dragged out, it was all in less than 24 hours."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,Moirawr,-13,Fri Jun 5 18:50:01 2015 UTC,"Is it a hobby for you to be contrary? Was this comment really necessary? One could say this was dragged out and be correct. There isn't a defined time threshold. It certainly doesn't take 24 hours and multiple conversations to reject someone. Starting to get sick of contrarian hobbyists, you are not adding anything to the conversation."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,rebel_nature,11,Fri Jun 5 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"I already explained in my original thread that I get messages from randoms on a weekly basis, and I ALWAYS give them a chance as sometimes it turns out to just be someone who wants to talk about how different Western culture is and/or want to better their English with the help of an English person.   This is an example of how the conversations USUALLY go though: http://imgur.com/a/bjq4L  As soon as this guy in OP's post messaged me I looked at his Facebook and immediately knew what he was messaging me for and I was already in a bad mood and getting frustrated that I was getting people messaging me begging me to be their girlfriend for no apparent reason and thinking I, for no apparent reason, owe it to them to be their girlfriend purely because they're sugaring me up.  As I said in my other comment: At the end of the day, you should NOT have to tell someone you are MARRIED for them to respect your lack of interest. ""No"" should be enough. It should not take you ""belonging to another man"" for them to accept your answer. That shows they only respect your husband, not you. This guy was a sleaze and got what he deserved and hopefully grew from the experience."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,Moirawr,-12,Fri Jun 5 19:13:00 2015 UTC,Thanks for the copy paste reply that has zero to do with what I said at all. Are you a bot?
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,rebel_nature,3,Fri Jun 5 19:15:41 2015 UTC,"You said it doesn't take 24 hours and multiple conversations to reject someone and I was explaining why I chose to not continue rejecting him and to, instead, go along with it and give him what he wanted then take it all back in the end. Rejecting someone, acting uninterested or merely not responding to someone never works for me, as you can see from that link I provided."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,Moirawr,-6,Fri Jun 5 19:21:16 2015 UTC,"That's not what the issue is. I don't care. I'm not judging you for doing it. I'm judging you for saying ""nuh uh spending hours lying to someone only to eventually reject them could never be considered ""dragged out"" and you are wrong about that. You are choosing to be contrary by arbitrarily redefining what ""dragged out"" means. You have arbitrarily decided that ""dragged out"" means longer than 24 hours, and somehow think that everyone should accept you definition. That is unnecessary, you are being contrary just to be contrary."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,rebel_nature,4,Fri Jun 5 19:24:58 2015 UTC,"I honestly just don't think that something that, cumulatively, only took a few hours is technically ""dragged out"", but that's just my opinion and your opinion is obviously different from mine.  If it had gone on for weeks then it's possible this guy could have developed legitimate feelings towards me by then, but I 100% do not believe he had any legitimate personal feelings towards me during the time this conversation happened so I didn't feel the need to worry about causing lasting damage."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,RajaRajaC,-4,Fri Jun 5 19:30:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah nah i'm not saying that, it obviously wasn't a nice thing to do but I don't think you did serious harm either and hopefully he learned a lesson, and he deserved it regardless of his problems.  There's just been a lot of people lately who have been doing what I'm complaining about, lots of ""nuh uh"" type comments that don't really mean anything just because a word wasn't used perfectly."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,rebel_nature,2,Fri Jun 5 19:35:51 2015 UTC,"I read your comment (even up-voted it) but I assumed when you said ""dragged out"" you thought maybe it had gone on longer than it did, so that's my bad for assuming. We obviously have different ideas on what something being ""dragged out"" looks like, but that's probably because I usually have nothing to do for the majority of the day so I look for things to fill up my time and, in relation to my typical day, that conversation didn't seem to take up too much time as I was busy doing other stuff at the same time.   I will say though this was the first and last time I decided to see what would happen if I just went along with a creeper's advances. In the long run it worked out better for me. I will only block people if I really really have to, i.e. if the harassment becomes unbearable, so compared to other  conversations this one lasted the least time as I get some guys who message me once, I say hi back, they say something inappropriate which causes me to stop responding, then they just completely bombard me for weeks after, begging me to respond until I have no choice but to block them. Now that is my idea of something being dragged on, haha."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,Moirawr,0,Fri Jun 5 19:45:39 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, where is the rejection here? They don't know each other, the guy was told she was married, and it was all over in about 20 messages. What is the issue here?"
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,AlcoholicJesus,3,Fri Jun 5 19:39:03 2015 UTC,"There's no issue, we just realised we had different opinions with regards to how much time the phrase ""dragged out"" can be applied to."
indianpeoplefacebook,38nccs,rebel_nature,2,Fri Jun 5 19:58:34 2015 UTC,"Read below. Or above. My issue is not what you think it is. If you fully read the comment you replied to, it clearly states what the problem is."

indianpeoplefacebook,38a7xi,snickerpickle,36,Wed Jun 3 05:16:59 2015 UTC,"Our college has a buddy program, where you can get extra social points for accepting a foreigner as your buddy and showing him around. He's full if entertainment, I'm gonna post more soon."

indianpeoplefacebook,38a7xi,johnbrackentan,4,Wed Jun 3 12:32:44 2015 UTC,"What are ""social points""? Or are you using that metaphorically?"
indianpeoplefacebook,38a7xi,thebestdj,17,Wed Jun 3 13:44:42 2015 UTC,"No, this is actually a thing in germany. You get social points participating in all kind of curricular or extracurricular activities, that are seen as social. You need those points, in order to graduate. It's kinda stupid, especially because they're super anal about it."
indianpeoplefacebook,38a7xi,blumune,4,Wed Jun 3 17:42:43 2015 UTC,What the fuck? You need them to graduate?   Are you going to a sixth form thing if Germany has those or is it an actual undergrad uni?
indianpeoplefacebook,38a7xi,snickerpickle,6,Thu Jun 4 06:51:58 2015 UTC,"I am not sure what a sixth form thing is, but no, this is a legitimate ""hochschule"", which is, as far as I know, the equivalent to a college. Initially most ""hochschulen"" in germany started this, because the companies that would get the newly graduates complained, that they weren't social enough. Good grades doesn't equal being a good worker."

indianpeoplefacebook,38a7xi,lolappan,26,Thu Jun 4 00:09:57 2015 UTC,Some Indians are not used to hearing people saying 'what's up' because English is their second language and generally 'what's up' is taken literally as it's meaning and not as a greeting. Pretty sure he got confused by this and just dodged the question to avoid being awkward. Source: me.

indianpeoplefacebook,38a7xi,LookThatGuyAgain,9,Thu Jun 4 01:25:15 2015 UTC,The thing is that he barely speaks english. Whenever I meet with him I only understand about 20% of what he's saying.

The guy with the sandal is Imran Khan a popular politician in Pakistan. He's apparently beating other Pakistani politicians. The other politicians are sitting like that because that's how kids in India and Pakistan sit when getting beat by their parents.
indianpeoplefacebook,3884wt,robreeeezy,10,Tue Jun 2 16:26:46 2015 UTC,"Imran Khan first and foremost is one of the greatest cricketers and captains to have played the game. At his peak he was seriously quick and co-developed the art of reverse-swing bowling. In his last 10 years, he averaged 21 with the ball and 50 with the bat. Holy fucking shit those numbers are way better than even Sir Gary fucking Sobers.  My first memories of Cricket are of Wasim Akram #rekting the English during the 1992 World Cup final and Imran lifting the trophy and retiring. What a man, what a player."

indianpeoplefacebook,37c6l2,nerpss,43,Tue May 26 22:17:50 2015 UTC,"Does anyone have an explanation of this unique, hard-to-explain behavior?   Yes, but before that,   Is it the fact that they are so overpopulated that some feel left out or a need to draw attention to themselves individually?   Uhh....overpopulation doesn't mean that 10 people cram into a room in stead of 1, and that they all have to literally compete for who is more visible. It means more competition on resources. People still get attention by doing worthy stuff in overpopulated countries, and some people try to get attention by doing worthless stuff even in underpopulated countries. Overpopulation has nothing to do with this behaviour.   Or does the culture promote exaggerated feelings of self-importance?   Sure, culture. Culture. What exactly is this culture?  Does the US culture promote neckbeardism among the sheltered folks? Does it promote men-hate among the feminists therein? Does the US culture promote police brutality? Does the UK culture promote child molestation? No, right? Does the western 'culture' as a whole promote things which are largely found only in a certain segment of their society? No right? Same is the case with the culture in this case.   It's all so strange and foreign.   Strange to all of us. Now, back to the question:   Does anyone have an explanation of this unique, hard-to-explain behavior?   Flex printing has emerged as a strong tool for political advertisement over the last decade, mostly because image editing and printing technology has become more accessible and affordable to people than it was before. Now, political advertisement in India is heavily targeted at the poorest segments of society, because they are a reliable voter's base, and look to local politics as a viable means to make their lives better, unlike much of the middle class which tends to over-look local politics and focus on intensive education, investment, etc. As a result, many flex printing shops tend to be owned, or managed, by people heavily involved in local politics, and also get funded by the same groups.   Often, the people who work in these places are young kids or the jobless youth, who are ready to work for relatively small pocket money, or even for free because they like being associated with the local group, kind of thinking which makes people feel like joining gangs. This group engages in putting up rather fancy flexes for political activities like meetings, gatherings, election advertisements, etc., so this behaviour becomes a part of their group life.   Now, you have a group of kids who have flex printing technology and knowhow ready at hand, who have funding by the local political group cuz they cater to their needs, and you have the globally common teenage impulse to swag. It's important to remember that the people who they idolize, the local political leaders, have their own flexes all over town to tell when it's their birthday, when their daughter passed high school, or when their diarrhoea has finally ended, as a way of remaining visible to people in some way or another.  So you have kids who do the same, print flexes in their own names and put them up, to talk about anything. They're not exactly serious, they're just following a trend, often in a knowingly hyperbolic way, because it's swag in their circles.  Source: I have a wide variety of friends."

I know almost nothing about contemporary India, although I do hope I get to visit sometime.  You seem to know what you're talking about -- why is contact with women punished, is this a Hindu or otherwise religious thing? Or is it caste-related? What type of punishment is it? In your opinion does it severely damage the social relations in India? Also do you believe that this sort of repression has led to the various rapes in the region I have read about? What is the sexual culture like there?  I know it's a lot I'm just very curious and you seem to be straight-forward. Thank you!"

She was all innocent around me, but I found out that she had me segmented away in some privacy wall on Facebook and her other posts were like this (a mutual friend showed me stuff that heavily implied she was cheating).   Moreso than that, her friend commented on a picture of us on the girl's page but in chinese characters. I might add since I was tagged in I could see it. And Facebook HAS A FUCKING TRANSLATE BUTTON BELOW YOU IDIOT! And of course she was saying something like ""is this the guy you were telling me about?"" and the girl said ""no, inbox me ;-P"".   She wasn't the brightest. When I broke it off with her, she was with some heavily tatted, mulleted mechanic guy days later (I know likely she was with him during), he took her to McDonalds. Classy.  I know it's kinda generalising but you don't think asians are like this because of how innocent their culture seems. Then again, those that have moved away are usually doing so often because their kids are rebellious and can't fit in the schooling system."

indianpeoplefacebook,36hila,arecbardrin95,3,Tue May 19 23:53:29 2015 UTC,Yup. You're pretty spot on.   And most brown guys literally go for any girl that gives them the littlest of attention.
indianpeoplefacebook,36hila,C0ck_Bl0ckr,3,Wed May 20 01:11:24 2015 UTC,"You seem to be going along the right thought-line but it seems to be slightly amiss, I just want to add that because of this pressure from the 'authorities' such as their parents, relatives, and the strict education culture that exists within brown communities, it creates within certain middle-class teenage brown kids who are going through puberty and those who are amidst their teenage angst a strange desire to rebel against these 'authorities'. This usually manifests in them becoming very narcissistic and simple-minded.  Also I'd have to argue that as a person who has actually lived in the Indian subcontinent during high-school and has seen firsthand what these middle-class teenagers are really like, I'd have to say it really isn't because they can't socialize. Not that I'm saying there aren't those kids among the Indian youth that are awkward because of their social incompetency rather what I'm trying to say is that the majority of the strange narcissistic teenage middle-class culture that you see in this sub has less to do with an actual lack of the ability to socialize. Furthermore I'd assert, after seeing that most of the kids who acted in such ways were actually those who were more socially competent and witty kids, that this has more to do with what these guys think is cool or fashionable or stylish compared to their local Indian culture. These guys are trying to be cool off the basis of what they've deduced is socially and style-wise considered 'cool' or 'alpha' based on the way western movies (mostly american) seem to portray what being cool is or is not. This plus teenage angst plus teenage rebellion plus a lot of exaggeration is what causes these guys to be so.... awkward.  Finally, I just want to say that such a phenomenon isn't unique to Indian teens and that this can be seen in some American teens and pretty much teens from any part of the world. It's just that it's much more widespread within Indian teens due to the reasons I listed above. Though, as the Indian subcontinent progresses we'll probably see a big change in how the teenager will express this strange angst and that it will largely decrease over time."
indianpeoplefacebook,36hila,UntitledTales,2,Thu May 21 13:30:40 2015 UTC,That's so accurate
indianpeoplefacebook,36hila,zunjae,2,Wed May 20 07:20:04 2015 UTC,"what /u/UntitledTales said.  It's not always that they're socially inept. There are projecting what they think is cool via photoshop (because getting actual tatoos is out of the question). Like a fantasy Bollywood/Musical sequence.  You can see that the hat and glasses derive from the ""hipster/vegan"" style, while the tattoos are from the ""metal"" genre, while the hair seems ""gothic/emo"". Being in India, he probably just picked up assortments of items from various sub-cultures in America and mashed them up to look ""cool"" (or rather ""classic"", hehe)."

These sort of structures called Pandals or Mandaps which are crafted by various clubs for worshipping and celebrating of various Goddesses every year. Every club has a theme for each Pandal. It's not mandatory to have a theme but it's cool to have one and it attracts the crowd. This looks like a Saraswati Puja Pandal with a Facebook theme. Saraswati is the Goddess of learning and as a result the teenage population is heavily involved in this. Most schools and colleges organize this Puja. So Facebook is obviously a clever and relevant theme to have."

indianpeoplefacebook,35etj9,insertWittyNameHere3,5,Sun May 10 05:26:42 2015 UTC,I imagine it meant rupees which is like $235. It's still big money in their economy but the rich in India can have similar living costs to lower middle class westerners. Also due to the nature of arranged marriages in India the husband having/giving/flaunting money is good so the nature of relationships is slightly different from how we perceive them

indianpeoplefacebook,34k2lh,antonica,2,Sat May 2 10:06:55 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's a troll account. He's just being Ketan.  I discovered his facebook account from Tumblr. People keep posting screencaps of conversations with Ketan and I thought it was hilarious so I added him on Facebook and talked to him. He was way too creepy and asked me to move to India to marry him & would occasionally send me messages like the above so I deleted him off. This was back in 2012 and I was 14 years old.  Also, most of the silly photos that he posts on his Facebook wall aren't his. People from Tumblr would edit him into stupid photos and send it to him."

indianpeoplefacebook,33tl88,Poyoarya,5,Sun Apr 26 19:37:28 2015 UTC,"Just look at their etymology.  Really comes from ""real + ly"", the adverb for real. Meaning ""actually, in fact, in reality"".   Literally comes from ""literal + ly"", the adverb for literal. Meaning ""actually, not figuratively"".   They're not identical, but they have a similar underlying meaning of ""not figuratively"" or ""not in abstract way"".   Here's ""really"" being used like ""literally"" (from Little Women):   It's been such a dismal day I'm really dying for some amusement,"" said Meg, as they sat sewing together that evening.   Also, sources for ""literally's"" long-established use:  Sir Walter Scott, Chronicles of the Canongate (1827):    ""The house was literally electrified; and it was only from witnessing the effects of her genius that he could guess to what a pitch theatrical excellence could be carried.""   Charles Dickens, Nicholas Nickelby (1838):   'Lift him out,' said Squeers, after he had literally feasted his eyes, in silence, upon the culprit. 'Bring him in; bring him in!'  ...  His looks were very haggard, and his limbs and body literally worn to the bone, but there was something of the old fire in the large sunken eye notwithstanding, and it seemed to kindle afresh as he struck a thick stick, with which he seemed to have supported himself in his seat, impatiently on the floor twice or thrice, and called his daughter by her name.   Mark Twain, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876):   Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with—and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty-stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth."

indianpeoplefacebook,33otp5,rreyv,-1,Mon Apr 27 22:02:04 2015 UTC,"It's extremely unidiomatic, yes. If you have another clause in the sentence, especially if it's related to timing, you can use it. e.g. 'I had already gone to her house by the time the post arrived.' 'I had just gone to the pub when my phone started ringing.' Another point worth noting is that 'had gone' tends to be qualified in some way, as I did above with the words 'already' and 'just'. Oh and also for explanations or narration in past tense. 'She asked why our parents weren't there. I told her it was because they had gone to the pub.'    But since you aren't literally telling a story about yourself, and the sentence almost always stands on its own, a sentence like this really grates on the ears. ""Anu Singh added 6 photos I had gone to my friend's house. Thanks for the fun time!"""

I should preface this story with her name being Paige.  He went up to her and did that classic cool-guy-leans-against-her-locker thing. And he said ""are you book hahahaha can i write on you?"". He told us he expected her to laugh and then he was going to write his number on her hand (he told us the game plan prior to actually doing it) but in reality she just said ""Huh? Oh haha"" and closed her locker and left. And the ""haha"" was like a pity haha. Not like a genuine laugh.  I'm not sure if Indian girls are susceptible to pickup lines, so he'd thought it'd work outside of india, but that was a trainwreck."

indianpeoplefacebook,32o7r2,kadala-putt,3,Wed Apr 15 19:32:14 2015 UTC,"To many people in India, a lot of websites like facebook are still ""that new fun website"". Think of Reddit, 4chan or Omegle, FB is like that to them.  A lot of these people have no idea that FB is integrated with real life for many people. It is just a site where they and a few group of  5-6 friends talk to each other and message random strangers. It is impossible for them to understand that today, a facebook account is your real-life identity and people have friends/family on it."

indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,squarerootof-1,9,Mon Apr 13 12:21:21 2015 UTC,"I think it's just that a certain type of person just gets off on these type of interactions. They know that there's really no recourse. You can't go up to a woman in public and say these kinds of things to her without fear, because she might hit you, she might call the police, bystanders might hear and intervene. On the internet, all she can really do is block you and most of the time they don't. Most of the time these interactions go on and on forever with the guy saying horrible things and the girl telling him to stop endlessly, which is just validating him.  If you go on /r/creepypms there are countless interactions just like this (and worse!) from Western men to Western women, so I really think it's more a personality thing than a thing where men in certain cultures are innocently misunderstanding how to talk to Western women."

indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,tutankaboom,-12,Thu May 7 04:06:21 2015 UTC,Yeah living and long term relationships be damned it is not like he is genetically predisposed to crave sex in a way no woman could understand.
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,akrebsie,9,Wed Apr 15 08:35:19 2015 UTC,"I think there are better ways of expressing it other than saying ""u luk xtrmly pretty n sexxxy babes!"", and ""juicy body figure....ummm"" to a complete stranger."
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,akrebsie,-4,Wed Apr 15 09:32:07 2015 UTC,Are you saying he expressed himself poorly?
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,tutankaboom,-17,Wed Apr 15 09:43:54 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong I think his behavior is vulgar and I think he should not be so rude, but only an entitled princess could destroy someones life for what is essentially harassment that can be blocked or ignored. I don't know what it did to him but a man can lose his job and/or be thrown out of his own home simply because of words said. (depending on the culture etc)  They were vulgar words, rude and a major misread of the promiscuous western culture but none of them were even malicious.  This princesses hurt feelings are not worth more than that mans reputation."
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,akrebsie,9,Wed Apr 15 09:53:55 2015 UTC,"Umm, just ignoring and blocking isn't enough, that's the problem. Ignoring them simply encourages them to do the same, since they get cheap thrills with virtually no repercussions. If she had simply ignored him, he would have kept on messaging her, and his messages would get even more vulgar and disgusting. Like I said, the only way these retards can be taught a lesson is by publicly shaming them."
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,tutankaboom,-9,Wed Apr 15 10:55:31 2015 UTC,"You are still not putting it into perspective but I understand you want to be a hero and protect her, ask yourself honestly if you would be so keen to protect a man if the roles had been reversed.   That woman who possibly has children relying on her could possibly lose her job and be alienated from her family if this man posts publicly the lewd things she said to him praising him sexually.  The man is considered to have thicker skin and maybe he does but equality can not ""see"" that or else it won't be equality."
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,Gobae,6,Wed Apr 15 12:05:46 2015 UTC,"No, this has nothing to do with ""trying to be a hero"". This is about harassment and how it should be dealt with. Again, she politely asked him to leave her alone and not to pass such comments, YET he continued on messaging her. She asked again, STILL HE DIDN'T LISTEN. He deserves a good ol'fashioned trashing to knock some sense into him. I hope his friends and family saw it.   And about your whole roles reversal, yes, even if it was a girl, my point would still hold. You are responsible for your actions. If you've done something illegal or horrific, you should be prepared for the repercussions. In your case, it's good that the mother is taken away from the kids. I mean, imagine what a role model would she be for them. Imagine how her kids would be like when they grow up? Since mommy sexually harasses men and intrudes other people's privacy, it must be the right thing. I'm going to do it too.   If someone asks you to leave him/her alone, YOU LEAVE HIM/HER ALONE!!!!!! It doesn't matter if it's a guy or a girl."
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,tutankaboom,-3,Wed Apr 15 15:22:11 2015 UTC,Whoa whoa whoa. Someone should have their kids taken away over a stupid mistake? It just doesn't seem like a fair consequence.
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,Gobae,5,Thu Apr 16 05:00:54 2015 UTC,"Mistake? How is this a mistake exactly?  Oh, I accidentally harassed you. I accidentally sent you those vulgar messages on Facebook, even after you asked me twice not to. Sorry, my bad, how absent minded of me, lulz. Jeez! -_-"
indianpeoplefacebook,32efp5,tutankaboom,-2,Thu Apr 16 05:14:13 2015 UTC,"""Mistake"" can either mean ""an accident"" or ""a regrettable decision"". I'm using the latter definition. You also haven't addressed the rest of what I said."

indianpeoplefacebook,31mz6m,Kumdogmillionaire,14,Tue Apr 7 12:08:58 2015 UTC,I've only seen people get banned after they get upset after their comments get removed.  It's not like there is any CSS hiding the rules in that sub.  Edit: forgot a word

indianpeoplefacebook,31mz6m,Kumdogmillionaire,11,Tue Apr 7 23:39:15 2015 UTC,I don't know what to tell you man. If you break their rules then they remove it. The amount of subscribers they have doesn't really add into it.

indianpeoplefacebook,31mz6m,Kumdogmillionaire,-7,Mon Apr 6 22:02:09 2015 UTC,"If your comment was removed then you had broken one of their rules. The fact that they had under 1000 subscribers at the time makes no difference if you broke a rule. The mods enforce the rules clearly stated in the sidebar.  The mods on creepypms aren't even ""strict"". Every one of their removals comes with a link to discuss the removal with them in modmail. Some users start seeing red because their precious comment was removed, they start leaving hateful/idiotic comments, then the mods ban them."

indianpeoplefacebook,31mz6m,katubug,-2,Tue Apr 7 15:15:26 2015 UTC,"yeah but the thing is they act all traumatized, as if they had no choice but to respond, get another fucked up message respond again etc.  if it's really that terrible, just block the dude / girl, or just turn your phone off. that's not valid for ppl you know in real life, but for dating sites, it absolutely is. no one is forcing these people to read that crap, yet they do it anyway."
indianpeoplefacebook,31mz6m,momslatin_dadsasian,4,Tue Apr 7 16:07:56 2015 UTC,"As someone who has responded to harassing dudes out of anger or frustration: it's because ignoring it feels like you're letting them win. They got to show you their dick, or insult you, or what the fuck ever, and you're just gonna sit there and take it because it's easier than standing up for yourself.  I am not necessarily proud of my reactions, but it doesn't make what happened to me less creepy or upsetting. Just because someone could have done better, doesn't mean they don't deserve sympathy for having something shitty happen to them."

Journalist / Constipated: He has so many secrets buried deep down inside that he wants to get out and expose but he can't and they stay buried.  Agoraphobic / Kinky: He's kinky but he'll never try anything in wide open spaces.  Masochist / Maniac: He's wild and extreme, but takes all the punishment on himself rather than impose on others.  Sick / Writer: Should be put together. He's a sick writer. You should check out his work.  The last ones are self explanatory: He suffers from panic attacks and bouts of anxiety, and Madonna songs help him out in those times. Or maybe Madonna songs induce the panic attacks."
