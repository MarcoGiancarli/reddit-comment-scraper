RealEstate,3e3zb4,tipsystatistic,23,Tue Jul 21 19:51:11 2015 UTC,"Bob and George both are sellers agents acting as dual agents. From what you wrote, neither are looking out for your interests. It does not sound like you have a buyers agent looking out for you. I would call an attorney before the closing to look everything over. After everything is done to your satisfaction, yes. I would complain to your state licensing board."
RealEstate,3e3zb4,lsp2005,9,Tue Jul 21 20:16:42 2015 UTC,"Im a broker and this sounds absolutely insane.  Definitely some incredibly shady stuff going on.  Report him to the state, the local board or realtors, national association of realtors, state association of realtors, etc, etc, etc.  We need to work together to get creeps like this out of the business...even though its almost impossible.  If he did nothing wrong then he's in the clear and wont get in any trouble, if not, make sure he does!  I can't stand people that give hard working, honest, and respectable agents and brokers a bad name.  They ruin it for everyone. Its sickening."
RealEstate,3e3zb4,dgreenpuffy,30,Tue Jul 21 21:21:57 2015 UTC,I see no problem with this.  -Bob 'n George Realty
RealEstate,3e3zb4,darkshadepigbottom,16,Tue Jul 21 21:40:02 2015 UTC,"Hell yes I would be filing a complaint. Depending on what they did or did not disclose to you they could be in some serious trouble. Did you just happen to notice that Bob was the owner, or was there some type of form that you signed acknowledging this? Someone may correct me, me but I am almost positive that when my wife and I (she is a realtor in TX) sell a property she has to disclose in some way that she is the owner.   Even if they haven't broken any rules (I'm pretty sure they have) they have acted extremely unethically. Call your local board of realtors and tell them what has happened. Obviously hindsight is 20/20, but as soon as you saw that Bob was the owner you should have asked them to refer you to a realtor at a different company. ""Your"" realtor, George, is obviously not working for your best interests. Who knows what you are paying for that you shouldn't be or whether or not you got a good price on the house. If it were me I would probably be giving a lawyer a call to have them give me their professional opinion on the situation."
RealEstate,3e3zb4,Pappy091,8,Tue Jul 21 20:10:04 2015 UTC,"Did Bob disclose to you in that he was the OWNER before any SUBSTANTIVE conversation about the home took place? And, did he again disclose it to you in WRITING before you made an offer?  Any failure on those things is an ethics breach on his part. He will be fined by the real estate board if you press the issue. I would sue him for a large part of his commission.  Also, “dual agency” is not possible in this case. Dual agency, to sum it up in one word, means neutrality. But Bob cannot be neutral on property he owns, by definition. What we should have here is a “designated agency”, which CAN and DOES represent you as a buyer’s agent, which means it should ADVOCATE YOUR INTERESTS…. But George has not done this, as shown by his handling of the paperwork, which is not only a failure at advocacy (buyer’s agent) but also a fail at dual agency (neutrality). George is representing the seller all the way here. Sue for commission."
RealEstate,3e3zb4,davegresham,11,Tue Jul 21 21:28:20 2015 UTC,"Don't close if they don't finish the repairs.  Bring an attorney to closing with you since you do not have any faith in your representation.  It sounds like Bob is probably the leader of a large team at the brokerage and he funnels out buyer leads to his subordinates.  There are two negligent issues, in my opinion:    The vague disclosures of agency representations (i.e. who is really representing you)  Was it disclosed on the listing that Bob (who is a licensee) is the owner of the house you are trying to purchase?  If he didn't, he could be in violation.  In my state, a licensee must disclose ownership interest.   I'm sorry to hear that you have had to deal with some shady activity.  Please know that not all agents are like that.  And please do find an attorney to take with you to settlement.  Good luck."
RealEstate,3e3zb4,sharkizzle,9,Tue Jul 21 20:06:38 2015 UTC,"So, they did disclose that it was his house when we signed the offer papers. But we didn't really understand who our agent was.  George is absolutely worthless and seems like basically Bob's puppet.  Going to follow everyone's advice and get an attorney for the close and refuse to close until the work is done.  Thanks!"
RealEstate,3e3zb4,Pappy091,4,Tue Jul 21 21:33:06 2015 UTC,"You should get an attorney for closing, but when I said you need to speak to an attorney, I meant that you need to see if you should bring a suit against these scumbags. I'm never the litigious type that thinks you should file a lawsuit just because you can, but I have to wonder if these guys have screwed you over in ways that you aren't even aware of. Have you ever bought a house before? Would you consider yourself knowledgeable of the buying process?"
RealEstate,3e3zb4,sharkizzle,4,Tue Jul 21 21:39:34 2015 UTC,Good move going with the attorney.  Definitely do not close until they finish up the work.  Hope everything works out!
RealEstate,3e3zb4,themeatbridge,4,Tue Jul 21 21:40:11 2015 UTC,"Laws vary by state, but Pennsylvania has a fund from which judgements against real estate agents are paid when they are sued for fraud.   Your best bet, besides and in addition to a real estate lawyer, is to contact your local association of Realtors. Tell them your story and ask for help. In addition to the laws your agent and his broker may have violated, they have almost certainly violated the professional code of ethics, for which they can be fined.   Document everything. Make copies of all contracts, emails, texts, faxes, telegrams, and postcards you have sent or received. Take notes on every phone call you have, including time and date, who you spoke with, and the substance of the call. Write down your story, in detail, leaving nothing out. Share this with your lawyer, and with the lawyer's approval, the local association of Realtors.   Edit to add, if Bob is not the broker, call Bob's broker as well."
RealEstate,3e3zb4,Tebasaki,5,Tue Jul 21 23:45:07 2015 UTC,"This sounds very shady. Don't close until the work is done. I don't care about anything else. The Seller wants their money, and after closing they have ZERO motivation for doing it. (Yes you could get legal on their asses, but that's expensive for you.)  So Bob's company is the one that owns it (flipped it) and he's selling it using George? This just seems really fishy. You might want to get a lawyer. I don't trust ANYONE that's asking me to sign a form that can't explain it. I expect my clients to ask questions, and I don't ""slip in"" forms and hope it sneaks by."
RealEstate,3e3zb4,DelRMi05,5,Tue Jul 21 22:00:06 2015 UTC,You probably have grounds for a complaint but somewhere they should have disclosed that they represent the seller and not you. Therefore you cannot expect them to look out for your interests. I'm not saying they are not shady (they sound it) but that's why you get people in your corner representing you. I would talk to a lawyer.
RealEstate,3e3zb4,wamazing,8,Wed Jul 22 01:39:03 2015 UTC,"Not only would I file a complaint against them both, I'd get my earnest money back and find another house. It's just a house. You are putting money in unethical people's hands. Any fine or letter of warning they get from your complaint is miniscule compared to how much money they are likely making on the house.   Did they pull permits for all the work that required it? If not, just another reason to run."
RealEstate,3e3zb4,ShortWoman,7,Tue Jul 21 23:45:23 2015 UTC,And yet another reason why buyers should interview and select a buyers agent before ever looking at properties.
RealEstate,3e3zb4,refinancemenow,3,Tue Jul 21 23:23:40 2015 UTC,You need be prepared to walk away.
RealEstate,3e3zb4,MsTerious1,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:48:07 2015 UTC,"ABSOLUTELY you should file an ethics complaint. Unfortunately, so far I'm not seeing guidance here that will get results. This will be a long post, but I HATE unethical people so I will take the time and explain what violations I see and what can be done about it.   There are many ways a complaint can be addressed, depending on what happened. There is the option of filing a lawsuit, getting mediation (where available), filing a complaint with a state's real estate commission, or filing a complaint with the local Board of Realtors ® if they are a member of the National Association of Realtors. Each of these has different potential outcomes:   Lawsuit: you could win financial damages and possibly get reimbursed court costs, as well as whatever other rulings a judge might make based on your state's laws and actual damages that may have resulted, etc. This can be addressed with a civil suit, or you can report a criminal act to your state's attorney general's office if you believe an actual crime has taken place (which could result in loss of licensure, too.) State real estate commission / local Board of Realtors: Members of the National Association of Realtors belong to a Board and depending on the size, a grievance might be handled locally or might require pulling reviewers from other areas. Either way, your grievance will be completed and the board will determine if you have reasonable cause, and if so, there will be a hearing. If they find in your favor, there may be a number of possible disciplinary actions that can range from mild (a reprimand letter kept on file for a period of time or ethics training) to more strenuous (fines of several thousand dollars, or even removal from the National Association of Realtors which means they also lose access to the Multiple Listing Service).    Neither approach is perfect. Court/mediation costs money that you will not get back if you lose. A grievance committee is often made of agents who don't want to be overly harsh to another agent and you must be very clear in your case and have good evidence because no action will be taken if you haven't proven your side effectively. If you want to do this, I would encourage you to study the National Association of Realtors Ethics Manual to understand the process before and throughout the procedure.   http://www.realtor.org/code-of-ethics-and-arbitration-manual  In the examples here, there are a number of violations likely. If you decide to file a grievance, you'll want to highlight each of the Articles in the Code of Ethics that was violated. You can read the Articles in the Code here: http://www.realtor.org/governance/governing-documents/the-code-of-ethics   It's a pain to do this, and you probably won't personally see much result, but I hope you'll decide to move forward in order to protect the public from things like this. Some of us take our responsibilities quite seriously, and agents who don't harm us all.  Please note: While George and Bob may have been acting as undisclosed dual agents, this is not necessarily true. They could easily have been acting in a seller agency capacity or as a transaction broker, depending on your state's laws and what was filled out on the appropriate forms. In any case, it doesn't appear that you contracted with any real estate agent to represent you. In both states where I am licensed, there is supposed to be a consultation where this is discussed with the buyer ""at the earliest opportunity"" or ""at the first substantial contact"" and ""never later than the writing of an offer to purchase."""
RealEstate,3e57j3,LongDrawn,7,Wed Jul 22 01:24:49 2015 UTC,"Nah flippers pick up houses at steep discounts whether they are through: auctions, short sales, reo's, or just getting lucky. Most of them don't try to game the market, if houses are selling for 400k they won't pay over 250k for the house (edit: the flipping you see on TV is generally fake, you'll notice they never file for permits or deal with inspectors). The initial deal is crucial to the flipper, they care less about the neighborhood being 'up and coming' or 'established' or 'affluent', it's all about the initial discount."
RealEstate,3e57j3,doublen00b,5,Wed Jul 22 01:29:13 2015 UTC,"They buy it way under the market value (a good deal) because it looks like a lot of work to a normal homeowner.  They then use trusted contractors, or do the work themselves at a lower cost then a normal homeowner can.  They make simple but attention getting cosmetic changes to the property and attempt to sell before covering a mortgage payment."
RealEstate,3e57j3,DeezNeezuts,4,Wed Jul 22 01:29:48 2015 UTC,"I flip houses. Other commenters got the basics, here is a little expansion:   Discount. I'm buying at a discount for many reasons: Property condition makes it unfinanceable and generally too scary for most people. Buying properties with title and lien issues that need to be resolved. Buying all cash, though that doesn't have as much impact as you might think.  Risk. This ties in with the discount, but I made it a separate point because it is important. I'm taking on the risk of fixing all the unknowns with the property. Maybe it is simple and easy, but just as likely it is huge and expensive. Lenders are unwilling to lend on the property because of that risk. So I buy it and take on 100% of the monetary risk if there are insurmountable problems. Not every property is a winner. Everyone gets burned once in a while. I  was talking with a guy last week who I hadn't seen in a long time. His last 2 flips were losers. Lost 30k on one and 70k on the other. Knocked him out of the game pretty much.  Value add. Often where real money is made is in the value add. Changing something about the property that significantly increase value. But you have to have the experience and vision to see those possibilities and make them happen. Zoning changes, land improvement, major property alterations. Construction and Design. I'm not necessarily getting things done super cheap. I pay my crews very well and I don't have time to deal with cheap subs. I pay subs less than retail, but not by a huge amount. Where I really save money is making smart and efficient design decisions. I do a little customer retail work here and there and you wouldn't believe how massively inefficient it is. Everything takes 10 times as long and 10 times the cost. Homeowners are making very personal decisions about their home. Not necessarily smart decisions. They make expensive construction and finish material choices. I make calculated construction choices and buy finishes that are warehouse available and look nice, but not massively expensive.  GC Profit. Remember when you hire a GC to remodel your house he is making a profit on that job. Similarly I go in and flip a house and sell it. The money I make on the sale can be seen as my GC profit for doing that remodel.   As for flippers making big money. It depends. Some do, some don't. Many are essentially working as self employed general contractors."
RealEstate,3e57j3,DCCWA,2,Wed Jul 22 02:27:22 2015 UTC,This is a really good and organized breakdown. Thanks!
RealEstate,3e57j3,wamazing,4,Wed Jul 22 03:29:29 2015 UTC,"If a house doesn't mean GSE minimum property requirements/standards it will be difficult or impossible to get a loan on. That's anything that affects the safety, security, or saleability of a house. FHA 203K can be done on some of these but most flips are cash purchases at a steep discount. What's your house worth if no one can get a loan on it? Certainly not as much. Flippers sometimes get short term loans from hard money lenders at much higher rates than mortgage rates.   Flippers also treat a remodel like a business. They have an idea what the market they work in wants and they've found sources to get supplies economically. They don't get tied to wanting some design or some of the silly things they show on those tv shows.    I don't know any flippers personally and I'm sure there are some good ones out there. But I've seen some bad flips too. Too many buyers fall in love with the looks of a place and don't have as much concern for the mechanicals or structure. Anyone considering purchasing a house from an investor needs to get good inspections and make sure any work that requires a permit was inspected and signed off on."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,gutterbumber,5,Tue Jul 21 19:31:16 2015 UTC,"You should have it inspected privately first. See if there are any major issues and if it should pass code.  Then if and only if you want to sell it call the permit office, explain you did not do the addition, you were not aware of the lack of permits, want to work with them and have them come take a look. Some inspectors are hard to work with and will be very nosey, others may just take a quick look around, sign off an an after the fact permit and be on their way. Worst case scenario they make you knock down the bedroom. It really depends on your county."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,idontwantablog,6,Tue Jul 21 20:05:33 2015 UTC,The problem with having it inspected means that he would then know about any issues and have to disclose them to any potential buyers. If he leaves it alone the chances of it becoming an issue when he goes to sell is pretty slim. I've never heard of a buyer checking to see if permits were pulled on a remodel that was done years ago. OP's best course of action is to leave it alone. The LAST thing I would do is call the city. That is horrible advice. They could come in and force him to tear the entire addition down at his cost.
RealEstate,3e3wdu,Pappy091,3,Tue Jul 21 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"I have actually walked away from a property because of a lack of permits on a remodel. It may also be a problem for certain mortgages if the appraiser lists the extra bedroom, but it's not listed with the county. He may also run into an insurance issue if the problem originates in that room."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,idontwantablog,2,Tue Jul 21 20:40:46 2015 UTC,"I am hearing just the opposite as Pappy091. And it is a recent development,  within the last year or so. In fact I don't know of any major lender who will knowingly loan on a place with nonpermitted additions any longer. Perhaps a portfolio lender wouldn't care.   OP already has an issue that must be disclosed.  I don't think not mentioning it is an option at this point."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,wamazing,2,Tue Jul 21 20:51:45 2015 UTC,"I hope I don't come off as shady seller here, but I don't think that knowledge that a house has had non-permitted work done at some point in the past is something that has to be disclosed. I recently had an electrician do some work at my personal house that technically required a permit being pulled and we didn't get one. That's not something that I am going to put on my seller's disclosure when we sell the house down the road.  A lender may have an issue with non-permitted work, but how would they know? It's not like they are going to go down to city hall and check.   In my town one of the school district employees (that also happened to be found to be embezzling millions of dollars from the school district but that's a different story) had a couple of thousand square feet, among other things, added to his house without pulling a single permit. The city came in and made him tear down the addition (which had been 100% completed) and start from scratch. That is what OP is risking here if he asks the city to come in and take a look. Unless OP is worried about some specific issues that that he sees, I would leave well enough alone."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,Pappy091,3,Tue Jul 21 21:34:19 2015 UTC,"In my state, that is something that must be disclosed. Shady or not it's certainly illegal."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,wamazing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:45:04 2015 UTC,Is that specifically on the seller's disclosure form or is it law? Just curious. That would suck for OP. If the city decides he needs to tear it down he could be out tens of thousands of dollars at no fault of his own.   Edit: That very well could be the case here in TX and I'm just not aware
RealEstate,3e3wdu,Pappy091,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:28 2015 UTC,"Where I am it is in the seller's disclosure asking if permits were required and if they were obtained. You can also go to town hall and get the housing card pulled, which lists all permits pulled on the house ever, and a list of past violations. It is obvious sometimes when work was done, like a house that never had anything on record when it is clearly updated."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,IQuestionEveryOne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:59:22 2015 UTC,"That may be the case here in TX, I'm not sure. So would that include work not down by the homeowner? OP can't be 100% sure that the work was done without the proper permitting."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,Pappy091,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:09:41 2015 UTC,"I knew on a house I saw that the home had work done on it, and specifically added to the contract them acknowledging that all proper permits were pulled for any work done on the house so they would be liable in case something happened, and they changed the wording to say since they moved in, to try to get around it. So it was pretty obvious. People don't want to lie in contracts and then get sued."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,IQuestionEveryOne,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"My state has a required disclosure form that seller is required to fill out and answer Yes/No/Don't Know to a bunch of questions. 99% of my answers are Don't Know. That is what most local RE attorneys advise. Unless you have direct personal knowledge your answer is Don't Know. Makes the form pretty worthless. There is almost never anything interesting disclosed on them.  When was the house built? Don't know, I wasn't there when it was built.  Is it connected to the city sewer? Well I'm pretty damn sure it is, but my answer is still Don't Know because I haven't dug up the line and seen the connection with my own eyes.  Has there been any remodeling work done? It's a 100 year old house. I would wager everything I've got there has been some remodeling work done. But answer is still Don't Know. I wasn't there 50 year ago to watch them build what looks like is probably an addition.  Were permits obtained? Don't Know."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,DCCWA,2,Wed Jul 22 02:48:27 2015 UTC,"Yes that is an item on the disclosure form.  Requiring a tear down is pretty rare IME. I have heard of it once in my area. Guy built a large stacked stone fireplace in a nonpermitted addition.  City inspector wanted to view the footings and obviously could not.  Most jurisdictions want to inspect,  collect the fees and fines, and add the space to the tax rolls."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,wamazing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:05:04 2015 UTC,"knowingly loan   I think that is they key here. Yes if you send them a letter saying ""I want to buy this house with an unpermitted addition"" it will likely cause problems. But most stuff sails through unless there is some obvious deficiency that gets called about by the appraiser. I haven't seen any problems like you describe."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,DCCWA,2,Wed Jul 22 02:49:36 2015 UTC,"4 years ago lenders were not as picky about non permitted space because GSEs weren't forcing buybacks on this issue.  Since then however lenders have gotten religion and I am hearing that loans are being rejected for this.    I would want to make it legal before listing on the market.  This will make it more attractive to buyers and likely raise the value of your house. You don't want to spend 30+ days in escrow and find out your buyer can't get a loan.   Some cities make the retro permitting process easy, others not so much.  Contact your local zoning office and find out what is involved."
RealEstate,3e3wdu,wamazing,2,Tue Jul 21 20:46:07 2015 UTC,"I think this is one of those things that is going to get harder and harder to get away with (non-permitted work) in the digital and post-crash age.   Investors were sold a lot of shady loans and want to recoup any of their losses possible. As more and more municipalities put these records online it becomes easier to verify things. Tax assessors are looking for any reason to fine people and boost revenue. My city recently had a 'forgiveness' program where people who pulled retro permits were only charged the regular fees, but no fines, in order to get people to come clean about these things.   If I were buying a place that had additions or significant remodeling it would be the first thing I check. You don't want it to muck up your deal someday when you want to refi or sell.   But what permits are required is governed by local codes and can differ by municipality."
RealEstate,3e2od4,EngineerBabe,11,Tue Jul 21 14:21:45 2015 UTC,"The biggest concern would be making sure your living arrangements extend a little past closing, so you don't find yourself couch-surfing in case you run into a situation similar to /u/spinel_sky."
RealEstate,3e2od4,wise_idiot,10,Tue Jul 21 15:42:10 2015 UTC,"That was the way the sellers of my house wanted the closing structured. My agent and attorney advised them that we close a few days early so that if anything came up, it could be remedied and they could keep their closing on schedule. They would not budge and wanted our closing at 8am and their closing at 3pm. This was also a Friday on the last business day of the month.  The house didn't pass the walkthrough Thursday night, and we had to deal with them trying to make crazy backroom deals with us to keep their closing on track. We didn't budge, and things were not remedied until Monday. We didn't really care because we had our apartment for awhile still, but they got all crazy about it.  It probably wouldn't be anything for you to worry about, but closing sometimes goes awry!"
RealEstate,3e2od4,spinel_sky,2,Tue Jul 21 14:56:33 2015 UTC,"I had this happen on a house I built once. Idiot used his ""friend"" to cut a deal on their mortgage. Well their ""friend"" didn't get his shit done and they'd sold their house. So they asked if they could move into my house before it closed (didn't have occupancy until the day before, this was 120 days before our drop dead closing date based on the contract mind you).  So first, our insurance won't cover their shit. Second, it won't cover us if we let them move in. So no you can't fucking move in before we've closed.  So they had to move twice in 3-4 days (tried to close on Friday).  The dude was such a fucking asshole, I found it quite fitting and funny."
RealEstate,3e2od4,fu2mod,7,Tue Jul 21 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone, again, no early occupancy!  My eye twitches just thinking about it."
RealEstate,3e2od4,PhredPhnerd,2,Tue Jul 21 17:27:09 2015 UTC,Since they'll be moved out by the closing/final walkthrough and unless your contract has a contingency based on the closing of their new purchase (doubtful) you should have little to worry about.
RealEstate,3e2od4,gaelorian,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:14 2015 UTC,They might try to move your closing if something happens with theirs. Are they planning with the assumption that their new house is completed and ready for move in that day?
RealEstate,3e2od4,catjuggler,2,Tue Jul 21 15:36:23 2015 UTC,"Will you be okay if the Seller screws something up -- e.g., you don't need to move out of where you are right away?  Then you're fine. If the Seller can't close on their deal and get out on time, close your deal then charge them rent (I've seen pro-rated mortgage plus ""convenience fee""). Have this conversation with the agents and let them know that this is the plan; get it in writing if you can."
RealEstate,3e2od4,fgben,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:32 2015 UTC,Very typical. They don't want to close on one without the other.
RealEstate,3e2od4,Phonda,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:22:42 2015 UTC,"That can make things really complicated for the agents because there are a lot of moving parts.  Honestly though, if you're buying the house they're selling before they buy the next one, you're pretty safe.  The main thing that could go wrong is if YOU don't close, it'll screw up the other seller's deal (in which your seller is their buyer).    I wouldn't worry too much about it, hopefully you've got a good Realtor who is keeping up on it, but you're probably the safest one in that situation."
RealEstate,3e2od4,NeedAChainsaw,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:35:00 2015 UTC,You'll be fine as long as you aren't forced to move out of your current place the say day.
RealEstate,3e2od4,atl2ptown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:16:38 2015 UTC,"So I was in the middle of all of this just a couple months ago.  We needed to sell our previous house to buy our current house.  The owners of the current house needed to close to buy their forthcoming house.  I have twin babies at home, so moving somewhere for a few days was not really feasible, so we made it work.  Their were some delays though as the house we were selling had a broken sewer pipe that needed repair, so that delayed everything by a week.  Basically, if there was a problem with the house at the end of the line it would have held things up even more.  So many moving parts as was previously stated, but you gotta do what you gotta do."

The question is can you take that money and make more then 4.5% such as a mutual fund? Although not guaranteed, probably. My vote would be to conserve your capital, use the banks money at 4.5% and go diversify the rest of your money in another low risk investment that averages more than 4.5% earnings after taxes."

RealEstate,3e2xwq,AmazingNinja,6,Tue Jul 21 16:28:19 2015 UTC,"I believe so. The investor I know will buy the house cash, but then go finance the house after closing."
RealEstate,3e2xwq,RealEmpire,4,Tue Jul 21 17:02:20 2015 UTC,"Some properties are un-financable due to conditions of the property. Illegal conversions, mold, ect can scare away lenders. You don't need to jump through hoops when you buy cash. At that point you can fix the issues and refinance it yourself or sell it at a mark up to someone pulling a loan."

Depending on their wealth, they don't feel like financing...they have enough skin in the game elsewhere, why pay away 4% on a house.   Yes, as some have stated, over the long run mkt earns more but doesn't it feel a little overweight at least?  So they unwind some position and buy a house.  For them it's like buying a pair of sneakers w/ cash.  You don't need to finance anything if you can afford it.  0 risk."

That mortgage payment becomes a big burden when you're unemployed and your investments drop 50%. If you're confident, I would totally take a larger mortgage and invest the rest.

This is an important point, the return you earn by avoiding interest payments is a guaranteed/zero risk return.    Compare that against 30yr govt bonds which trade at around 3% yield today, and on a risk adjusted basis that 4.5% is looking pretty awesome.  These things cannot be considered in a vacuum though, and asset allocation is something which should be looked at holistically, on an individual basis."
RealEstate,3e2xwq,jonjiv,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:59:17 2015 UTC,"You ignored the term.  Is this 30 or 15 year?  Would putting 20% down get you in a shorter term?  If so, how much would you save in interest?  It isn't always cut and dry as you so put it."
RealEstate,3e2xwq,what-the-what-what,3,Tue Jul 21 17:47:27 2015 UTC,"Isn't the term fairly irrelevant? You pay a lot more interest on a 30 year loan, but you also make a lot more money having that cash invested for 30 years. All that matters is that your investment return over the term is higher than interest paid."
RealEstate,3e2xwq,atl2ptown,-1,Tue Jul 21 18:00:59 2015 UTC,My point was that there are many variables.  But yes I agree with your statements.
RealEstate,3e2xwq,what-the-what-what,2,Tue Jul 21 18:16:04 2015 UTC,"The term is irrelevant. All that matters is the return versus the interest rate. You're also ignoring time value of money. A fixed 30 year rate requiring X in rent to cover the mortgage gets substantially cheaper over time as rent naturally climbs.   Meaning, the extra capital now is substantially more valuable.  The issue involved is pricing in risk. Is the lost capital worth the reduced risk with a smaller mortgage? That's a question only the buyer can answer."
RealEstate,3e2xwq,atl2ptown,0,Tue Jul 21 19:06:42 2015 UTC,"as rent climbs, sure.  But there is also inflation of the dollar.  I see the term is irrelevant like you say.  Just as long as some truly computes the difference in a short-term and a longer term mortgage interest."
RealEstate,3e2xwq,moshennik,2,Tue Jul 21 19:50:19 2015 UTC,"Inflation in the dollar is precisely why capital today is worth more, and why locked in interest rates will become less costly later."

RealEstate,3e2xwq,1wf,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:16:46 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I'm misreading, but a shorter term will give you a lower rate.  Plus compound interest is a bitch so you'd save an enormous amount of money with a lower rate and shorter term."

RealEstate,3e2xwq,harrywhite1,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:06 2015 UTC,"This is how I understand it, please correct me if you see a mistake. I'm using this calculator. If you take a 30-year fixed loan for $220,000 @ 4.25% with 20% down, you'll pay $135,693 in interest, assuming you make the minimum payment. For that same loan, but with a 15 year rate and say 3.75%, you'd pay $54,384 in interest.  Now let's say you pay off the 30-year loan in 15. Because you're smashing down the principal so quickly, the interest can't build up quite so dramatically early in the loan. You'd pay $59,887 in interest. About $5,000 more than the 15-year terms, but you will have that extra flexibility.  Of course, the trade off will vary depending on the interest rates."

Some of these neighborhoods will recover (spectacularly), and others will not do very well at all.   SFH's in nicer homes are very overpriced in most of the places you'd want them, at the moment.

There is a link on my home screen down on the left hand side to test compatibility.    Typically none of the online RE management programs are compatible with upgrades for quite a while after they are released, including browser updates, windows updates, adobe updates, and just about any other kind of update you can think of.  I have been working on these platforms for about 10 years and they are very slow to upgrade with technology across the board.  In fact I believe there is one or two that I use that is not compatible with anything higher in internet explorer than ie9 still."
RealEstate,3e0zbm,sonofalando,9,Tue Jul 21 03:01:51 2015 UTC,Be prepared for a stressful snafu shortly before closing. Keep your head about you.  Be sure to change your locks after closing.  Remember that something will need to be repaired or replaced in your new home no matter what the home inspection report says.  Some people think home warranties are a ripoff. I think they are a great thing.  Good luck!
RealEstate,3e0zbm,ShortWoman,2,Tue Jul 21 03:07:18 2015 UTC,"Seconding this. I closed on my house exactly a month ago, and despite having a decent inspection done, our thermostat broke during walkthrough, the run start a/c capacitor burnt out, the elbow to the primary water supply leading into our house disintegrated, ignitor module in our stove went out, and I discovered that when it rains hard enough the exhaust vent in the bath leaks.   So yeah, have money set aside especially if the house has been sitting for a while. Ours was vacant for six-eight months. I knew that owning a home would be work. I was just hoping the work would be a little more spread out."

We ended up having to replace the washer/dryer, bought a new fridge and then carpet paint went from a few rooms to a fuck ton of rooms.   Give yourself as much time as possible to prep before move in. Anything you want to do, do it before hand. Eg - I ran cat5e cable, added outlets, moved switches, installed fans before moving in.

My wife made our curtains to give our home a more homey feel as well.    Oh, practical things - we have recurring appointments in our calendar to make sure that we do things like get the furnace checked, trees trimmed, gutters, roof inspection, foundation inspection, etc.  That way we don't forget something - it's just easier to remember.    Somebody had a GREAT trick the other day - if you're painting a room, get two labels from the paint supplier:  one for the can, obviously, and one for under a light switch cover so you know EXACTLY what color you used.    Obviously keep a bunch of smaller paint cans for touch ups (finding this super helpful now)."
RealEstate,3e0zbm,dragonvet,2,Tue Jul 21 03:11:20 2015 UTC,"Go with the inspector and bring the same kind of move-in checklist a landlord would use. The longer the list, the better. Don't be afraid to make closing contingent upon some or all of the issues you find being fixed by closing (if it's a conventional sale that is, if it's a short sale or foreclosure the bank won't do it). You can also have the seller pay some of your closing costs. Ask your realtor if they feel there is wiggle room in the asking price for such things. I know it will be a bit of an upfront expense, but switch all your bulbs to energy efficient bulbs when you move in. If it's a block home, they have insulating foam that can be pumped into the walls to make your home super energy efficient. Also check how thick the insulation in the attic is, if it is less than R-30 (11 inches of fiberglass or rock wool or 8 inches of cellulose) you'll want to add more. You can also get tax credits for making energy efficient upgrades like energy efficient windows. If this is just a temp home, maybe not worth the expense, but if you expect this home to be yours for 5 years or more, I would make the energy efficiency upgrades as soon as possible to help reduce your utility bills. I advise having all property taxes (city, county, state, etc) put into escrow with your lender. You don't want to get a ridiculous bill at the end of the year. Easier to pay it as you go along. Remember that flood insurance is separate from regular home owner's insurance. You're going to want both just about anywhere you might live, but especially in areas prone to flooding like Gulf states. Remember to change your A/C filter every month or two and have the A/C ducts checked for leaks. If you have a basement and it doesn't have a sump pump already, I advise putting one in. There are different levels of home inspection. If your inspection did not include checking for termites and such, get a termite inspector out there. OK, this is getting long. I hope some of this is helpful to you."

RealEstate,3e13fz,PeteDub,2,Tue Jul 21 14:43:01 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Flooring, paint and landscaping in front are easily the cheapest, and most noticeable changes to make.  Pick the one that looks the worst and attack."
RealEstate,3e13fz,NeedAChainsaw,4,Tue Jul 21 15:48:13 2015 UTC,"Also, how does your front door/porch look?  Buyers spend a lot of time looking at it while the Realtor digs for the key.  Go stand on your front porch and look around, what do you see?"
RealEstate,3e13fz,NeedAChainsaw,2,Tue Jul 21 15:48:56 2015 UTC,"This right here is an excellent bit of advice. The porch is often overlooked but it's usually the first area the buyer really stands in idly while their Realtor opens the door. It can set the mood for the entire showing.

Have you recently updated your kitchen but still have your old appliances?  Make sure the house ""matches"", if that makes sense.

RealEstate,3e13fz,PeteDub,6,Tue Jul 21 05:15:31 2015 UTC,"Updating the garage will not give much value in a home. If you spend $10,000 on the garage an appraiser might give you 10-20% on that in additional value."

Blanket statements like ""updating a garage will get you 65% on average"" is dangerous because it's different in every market.  Around here, a lot of people LOSE money making their garage into a living space because now you don't have a garage and people don't want a house without a garage.  If you spend money to drywall/paint it, no one really cares.  Don't get upset when someone makes a point contrary to yours, in real estate there is a lot of room for you both to be right and it makes you look silly to argue like that."
RealEstate,3e13fz,deceptinomonom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:40:18 2015 UTC,The only time I've seen a garage upgrade really pan out was having it setup for heat and air. It really appealed to a client that worked on his cars frequently.   You will get more appeal and value in other areas of the house.
RealEstate,3e13fz,NeedAChainsaw,2,Tue Jul 21 16:53:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely.  There's nothing to say that the buyer WON'T appreciate the upgrades, but when doing updates to sell, mass appeal is the idea and most people don't really care about the garage as much as other areas of the house.  If your buyer wants to put AC in his garage and a workbench, he can do that himself, it's not that expensive."
RealEstate,3e13fz,icantrange,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:15:18 2015 UTC,"Ok, here's another question.  If the garage was structurally intact but was bare bones as far as the interior goes and looked really shitty, would it be cost/time efficient to put up a layer of particle board or something of that sort?"
RealEstate,3e13fz,NeedAChainsaw,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:21:46 2015 UTC,The floor of the garage is it sound? That's one of the most important parts of a garage. Is the garage well ventilated? Not one person can convince me that any person other than a person who hates life wants to be in a garage that in 80 degree weather is 100 degrees. The walls are important in a garage but shelving and storage is a wiser investment than particle board. For boarding the garage you would be wiser to use drywall.
RealEstate,3e13fz,icantrange,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:30:26 2015 UTC,"You're right about the kitchens and bathrooms but those are also the most costly rooms to update in the house per sq ft.

It's certainly high if there are no points.  Escrow in the closing charges sense has nothing to do with your earnest money deposit.  It's escrow for taxes & insurance.  That's just going to be based on your local taxes and your homeowners insurance and your closing date.  Nothing the bank can control.  /not your atty"
RealEstate,3e2vsn,ctrealestateatty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:28:06 2015 UTC,"Hey,  Thanks for your response. Yes, I meant origination charge. I don't think I'm paying any points.

RealEstate,3e2vsn,Pennysboat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:45 2015 UTC,Please shop around.  Call at least 2 lender and 2 mortgage brokers.  Get things in writing and compare everything.  If you find one broker that you really like and he/she is not the cheapest show them the cheapest quote you got and walk through it with them.  Chances are they will point out where and why things are different and maybe can help reduced their rates.  In response to your question that origination charge seems high unless you are buying points to get a lower rate.  If there are no points and all that money is going to the broker or lender than I would most certainly shop around.   I think I paid a 1.5% origination charge but most of that was offset by lender credit so I actually had a negative adjusted origination charge.

Can you come up with another 15k to get up to 20%, this way you don't have MIP, for 3.75% interest rate your origination should be 0 or close to 0.  Maybe take higher rate with points credit, so your closing fees are close to 0, and this would let you get to full 20% down?  In any case, shop lenders, yours seems to be way off."
RealEstate,3e2vsn,moshennik,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:46 2015 UTC,"Hi Moshennik,   Thanks a lot for this. I had a gut feeling that this was way too high. I'm happy that I posted here.

RealEstate,3e2vsn,icantrange,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:54:13 2015 UTC,"No problem.  I would just hate to ""waste"" 4100 (more if financed). Maybe you can get some of the money a ""gift"" from your family. If you are 20k short of 20% down, you immediately pay 4100, which is a 20% hit on those 20k."

RealEstate,3e08a9,3Dminters,2,Mon Jul 20 23:20:40 2015 UTC,I have to say that I totally disagree with your premise.  Most real estate companies can net you more money in your pocket than you selling FSBO. Stats from home sales across the nation say Realtors on Average of FSBO's will net about 12% more and sell it quicker.  They normally charge 6%.  So is it Net or Gross that you are worried about?
RealEstate,3e08a9,dcm4924,3,Tue Jul 21 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"My husband once did, which was interesting when I resumed my occupation as a Realtor. He told me how unnecessary agents are. He no longer believes that.   Even though your friend may pay a percentage that he thinks he could save by NOT hiring someone, the truth is that we pay for ourselves much of the time.    Most FSBO sellers offer 3% to any agent who finds a buyer. Why? Because buyers are frequently tied to an agent. This means a seller MIGHT save 3% on the listing side, but only IF s/he finds a buyer directly, which may or may not happen.  Sellers often harm their own ability to negotiate. If you think that you can negotiate better than an agent who sells 20, 30, 40 houses a year, great. But an agent who can negotiate well can often close that 2-4% gap that you might miss out on by negotiating for yourself.  A number of legal protections go away if you represent yourself. Who will the buyer sue if they are unhappy? Your agent and his/her broker if you had one, particularly since they have insurance against such things. You, on the other hand, do not. But if there aren't any deeper pockets than yours, then it puts that bullseye on your back."
RealEstate,3e08a9,MsTerious1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:12:06 2015 UTC,Land and houses are very different types of loans and transactions. Are you trying to sell just unbuilt plots?
RealEstate,3e08a9,nofishies,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:34:04 2015 UTC,"Hi there - I'm a commercial real estate agent in Los Angeles myself, and I'd love to help you out. While I agree that it sucks to have to pay tons of money simply to sell a house, it's often the best way. If your friend is trying to do a FSBO, there are some good guides out there but the honest truth is this: the best person to sell a house is someone who has done it before.   As I said, I'm a commercial agent, not residential. With that in mind, the way I look at any transaction requires a lot of attention to detail on what is and isn't worth your time. For a FSBO, you have to weigh what your time is worth (because you'll be spending a LOT of time staging, negotiating, going over contracts, speaking to potential buyers, etc.) against what the costs to employ a Real Estate Agent would be. If you want to talk, you can PM me. I wont charge you anything and I know quite a few LA submarkets pretty well."
RealEstate,3e08a9,Wrestled,-1,Tue Jul 21 00:53:21 2015 UTC,"THX. Let me ask you this. Can't you lock in a price, stick to it, and only ""close"" when you agree 100% and pass it off to a real estate person? What is wrong with this process? If the seller sticks to their guns on the price and shakes hand, how is this difficult? Thanks."
RealEstate,3e08a9,roboticbobwhite,4,Tue Jul 21 00:57:51 2015 UTC,"Well, any contract will have a ""locked"" price, but that price is hardly set in stone (see below). Additionally, it will be hard to find a buyer who doesn't have their own agent/or is comfortable with a FSBO using no agent.   Most any ""standard"" contract will have outs for the buyer for things such as the property not appraising for the agreed price, for necessary repairs, etc etc.  The seller can stick to their guns, but if the buyer doesn't have cash to make up the difference between the appraisal price and the contract price, the bank will not lend the necessary amount to purchase. If the seller won't repair certain things found in the inspection, again, the bank won't lend.   I am definitely not adverse to FSBOs, but as a seller you do limit your audience, and it definitely requires more than a hand-off in the end to a ""real estate person."" Most agents will also tell you that since they know the market the best, they will be able to price it right in the first place. Many FSBOs are either underpriced (thus resulting in less $ in the seller's pocket) or are overpriced and linger on the market.   I am not an agent, and have purchased FSBOs without any issue in the past, but I have a lot of real estate experience having run a title insurance company in the past (easily 1000+ closings). Not trying to discourage you, but buying/selling 3-5 houses might not be enough experience to knowledgeably deal with a FSBO.  I'm sure others will chime in with other suggestions, best of luck to you."
RealEstate,3e08a9,Wrestled,2,Tue Jul 21 02:07:22 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with that in theory, but my concern would be your methods of valuing the house. Do you have access to the necessary comparable sales in the area? Do you know how much work the home will need to be brought up to full market value if someone would be trying to flip it? How good of a negotiator are you (since sticking to a price is difficult, but not impossible)? This isn't even worrying about the idea of showing the property, which should (in my opinion) NEVER be done by the person living there. A real estate agent can remove the emotion of the owner from the equation which is important in trying to sell a home."
RealEstate,3e08a9,Wrestled,0,Tue Jul 21 18:32:13 2015 UTC,"How do you determine your price? What data are you using to do so? What services do you have access to? Keep in mind that zillow is absolute garbage (look it up if you'd like) and anything halfway decent is prohibitively expensive. Sticking to your guns is easy, but your price at best is perfect, and at worst is massively under or over value. Better to ""hire"" a real estate agent from the beginning as they are only paid once the transaction closes."

RealEstate,3e08a9,moshennik,2,Tue Jul 21 20:20:48 2015 UTC,"90% of people who sell by owner are going to net less money than they would with an agent. The majority of buyers who are looking for fsbo are looking for a great deal. Is that what you intend to give them? You can't possibly believe that everyone who sells real estate only wants your money. I rather enjoy helping people and making them money that I know they would lose if they didn't hire a pro. The man who buys cheap pays twice. Don't step over dollars to pick up nickels. You will most likely spend several hundred up to a couple thousand dollars and not sell the house.

RealEstate,3dzr70,solidcopy,8,Tue Jul 21 05:38:21 2015 UTC,"While in theory sounds like a good idea. Here are the following steps involved for you to consider this seriously.  In order to get financing, you have to have credit worthiness, income that supports your mortgage payment, down payment if you want to avoid PMI and whether property will appraise for 120K asking price. Once these above are considered, then you can think about other issues such as property taxes, home owners insurance and income taxes on rent payment you will be getting from neighbor and some amount for any unnecessary expenses.  Edit 1: This sounds like a good idea on paper, but the above post is directed to understand if you know the home buying process."

RealEstate,3dzr70,worstnightmare_15,4,Mon Jul 20 21:45:20 2015 UTC,"The banks would like your debt to income ratio to be around 36-40% including this new mortgage payment. This debt to income ratio is based on your gross monthly income. Use online calculators to determine how much mortgage payment would be on a loan for 120K (minus if/any down payment you want to put).  Now take your expenses (car payment + minimum payments on credit cards + any monthly payments such as alimony + your new mortgage payment + monthly portion of property tax) and divide by your total gross monthly income. This will help you understand where you stand in debt to income ratio. In your income, you may be able to add rent payment you will be getting from neighbor, however I am not 100% sure.  Yes, talk to a mortgage loan originator in your primary bank.  I am giving this info as I know and some specifics could be different with your state or your lender. This will help you do some research."

Just throwing together some numbers: if you put 20% down (24k) then your monthly P&I payment would be about $450 +/-.  If you can't put down 20% you'll probably end up paying PMI, that will add some money each month to your bill.  Now you need to find out what your monthy taxes and insurance will be.  Maybe throw in another 250/month for repairs and maintenance.  Assume you might have some vacancy in the other unit."

Source: I am an agent, and I would charge you to do a market analysis if you didn't sign a contract for me to represent you in the purchase. I don't spend two to three hours carefully analyzing your transaction if you aren't going to compensate my time, and if you won't compensate, you'll get the ""straight from the logarithm"" method that can be off by 10-20%.

RealEstate,3dzr70,witoldc,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:12:38 2015 UTC,"Different states have different laws, but all of them will have laws about ""agency"" and ""fiduciary duty.""   It used to be that sellers paid all fees, and all agents worked for the seller's best interests. Then buyers came along and said, ""Wait! I don't like that! I want someone to look out for my best interests, too!"" And that is when ""buyer agency"" (and buyer agency agreements) were born.   Since buyers often didn't have the money to pay out of pocket for this kind of representation, it evolved to a seller paying these services out of their proceeds as they had been doing anyway. They just now paid for someone to represent you while another agent represented them.   If you came to me and asked me to do that kind of work for you, I'd be reluctant to do this unless I knew my time would be compensated. I wouldn't turn you away, but I wouldn't do a full analysis and I sure would not become your advocate and negotiator for free."

With 620 credit score, you're going to have trouble getting reasonable financing.  You'll be paying a substantial premium for this score.  Additionally, if you don't have 20% down, you'll be paying PMI on top of that.  It doesn't hurt to talk to your local bank, particularly if you're part of a credit union.  You will know where you stand, and whether you can get decent financing so you can actually analyze the situation.  No point in analyzing it if you you can't get decent financing."

If that's the case, then figure out how much of a downpayment you have and plug your numbers into a mortgage calculator - that should give you an idea of the ballpark payments. If you want to get an idea of whether 120,000 is a good deal  Also, don't forget that there are many costs aside from the mortgage - property taxes, maintenance, HOA fees, etc. Also, if your renter moves out or stops paying rent, you'll have to cover the mortgage until rent payments resume. So to be a landlord and owner occupier, you need to factor in regular additional expenses plus largish unexpected expenses.  Also, regardless of how the monthly payments work out, it's not in your interest if it's overpriced - look to see what 120k buys you in your area."

RealEstate,3dzr70,Realestateuniverse,2,Tue Jul 21 14:41:39 2015 UTC,"How tight is your budget? Like, is $600 all you can come up with per month? Because realistically you will be shouldered with more than that. Are you able to pay for repairs, taxes and other things that come up? What would happen if the renter moved out and you weren't able to find a new tenant for a few months? Would you be able to do the $1200 per month payment on your own?   It's not a terrible idea to buy a rental property, but make sure you do some research on the true cost of home ownership. For instance, this year, we had foundation issues, we had a drainage pipe break that had to be dug up and replaced, had some wiring issues, and had to replace the sump pump. One year we had a flood, which cost about $2000 to repair the damage from (and that's with doing most of the work myself). There is not a year since I've become a homeowner that we've spent less than $1500 in home repairs.   If you do go ahead with this, I would make sure to have a savings account for these types of repairs. If something breaks that affects the tenants next door, you'll have to fix that immediately. Good luck!"

RealEstate,3dzhwp,whataboutmydynamite,9,Mon Jul 20 20:37:53 2015 UTC,The less you say the better but this does sound good. The lender just wants additional assurances because they know you will rely on rents to make up most of the mortgage payment.

When I hear a house has been on the market for 3 months, the only real, honest, and, quite frankly, obvious reason is that your price is too high.  A home goes on the market for one dollar. No matter the conditions, someone is going to buy it because they can do afford repairs, remodeling, or what have you because they just got the house for a steal!   Here's what's happening: people are seeing your listing, whether in the MLS or via app. They're seeing the pictures (this home is staged well and looks to be in good shape), they're seeing the area, but they're not deciding to make an appointment or write an offer. Why? Based on what they see, they think it's overpriced. Otherwise, you'd have multiple buyers on hand. If you lowered the price to $150k, you'd be swimming in buyers. If you lowered it to $160k, you'd be swimming in buyers. If you lowered it to $170k, some of those now swim off, but you still have a ton of interest.  See what I'm doing here? We're getting closer to the correct price range. If in three months time you have only had one real offer, your price is way off. Period. I don't care what anyone else is saying about it. The problem with any home sitting on the market forever is only ever the price. Lower that SOB more than $2,500 at a time. Make your price reduction substantial and move that listing to a contract!"
RealEstate,3dz3ws,ArabicaBeans,16,Mon Jul 20 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"You're looking at your house as the home that you have lived in for however long. Clearly it worked for you, otherwise you wouldn't have bought it. You need to change your thinking, and instead look at it through a buyer's eyes.  There are several things I see that will turn off a significant amount of buyers, therefore drastically decreasing your pool of potential buyers and therefore offers:   You have no bathtub in your house. This automatically turns away anyone with young kids - or who plans on having kids and wants to stay in the house for ~ 4-5 years. You need a bathtub to bathe young kids in, in the age phase between bathing in the sink and when they're old enough to take showers. Your bathrooms are clearly updated nicely - but whoever did the updates didn't really take into consideration that a future homeowner might have young kids to take care of. Your lot is definitely going to turn off a lot of buyers. No flat space for kids or pets to play in. You have acreage, but it appears to be largely wooded, and none of it is level. What if Dad wants to teach a kid to throw a baseball? Or ride a bike in the driveway? Or throw a frisbee to a dog? Or what if the potential buyers are young professionals who want to set up cornhole boards? No place for any of that. Buyers with pets are going to want a fenced-in yard, or a yard that they could fence in. Due to your lot (wooded and hilly) it looks like fencing at least part of it in would be difficult, not to mention expensive. If I was a buyer in your area, I would walk away from the house for this reason alone, because one of my must-haves is a fenced-in yard to let my dog out in. It's not clear from the pictures, but you don't appear to have a garage. Some buyers are going to rule it out solely because you don't have a garage. You don't appear to have a basement either, which is crucial for storage (at least in my market). Most people have tons of crap they don't really need and want to make sure they have a space to put it all. This may also be a concern for parents, but for a different reason: basements are good places for shelter during extreme storms. You don't appear to have one, so the whole family would have to cram into (presumably) a bathroom. Your wooded lot makes this even more of a potential concern for parents - higher likelihood of a tree falling on your roof than houses on other lots that are less wooded. The hilly-ness of your street may be turning potential buyers off as well - I'm guessing in inclement weather it could be difficult to navigate. This is going to turn off some more mature buyers who tend to be more cautious drivers.   These may not have been concerns for you when you bought the house because they don't apply to you, if you don't have young kids to bathe, aren't a dog person, etc. BUT: selling a house is a numbers game. Given the same basic numbers (beds/baths/sq footage/price): The more features (or lack thereof) of your house that cause buyers to cross it off of their list of potentials, the less potential buyers you have. The less potential buyers you have, the less likelihood that you have of getting an offer."
RealEstate,3dz3ws,ky_ginger,7,Mon Jul 20 19:38:04 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. They seem like small things, but the lacking bathtub is huge. Practicality aside, I'd settle for no tub at the right price, but my wife would definitely miss those ""bubble bath pics"" of the kids.  They're great for bathing larger dogs as well, which are out anyways because of the back yard.   All of that can be remedied by the buyer, but they're going to be considerations when it comes to pricing.   Also, Op, take some new exterior pictures, I care more about lot than interior tbh. Current pictures would make it more private and inviting. Every picture has another house in it and that would turn me right off. It looks like a great home, you just need to get them in the door."

RealEstate,3dz3ws,ShinyLightning,4,Mon Jul 20 19:32:38 2015 UTC,"Like others, I agree you are a good ways over market value.   So to add something... you should have your agent take some new exterior pictures on a nice day. The grey sky/no leaves look is not flattering, especially on a grey house. It looks depressing. Also, the leaves will make the back yard look more private by hiding the other homes that are right behind you a little bit.  Also, you have fiber cement siding, a nice bonus that can't be seen from Zillow since it just lists other for exterior type.  Until I checked it on Realtor.com I was wondering if it might be Masonite (yuck). You can have your agent update the comments to include something about this.  One other issue you have is a 11+ year old stained roof. I can't be sure from the pics, but it looks like composition shingle, which would mean it is getting close to end of life. The stains just call this out. If it it architectural, have it cleaned. If not, this is a reason to drop the price even more or consider replacing it. ""New Roof"" makes a nice selling point, but not a dollar for dollar investment, so something to think about in those terms.  Many people hate stacked washer/dryer combos. Is there room for a side-by-side if the slop sink is pulled? If so, add that to the comments as well.  Lastly, you have HOAs. This can hurt. Since it doesn't say how much they are, people will assume the worst. If they are low, you might want to mention the amount."
RealEstate,3dz3ws,sarcasticorange,4,Mon Jul 20 21:58:22 2015 UTC,"A price drop should be like 10k, so you should be around 180k by now, 2500 is nothing. And it looks like you paid 191 2 years ago, I understand wanting to get your money back, but If you drop to 180 it should definitely sell"

I hope your agent and your own research has already indicated that your asking price is too high for the market. Do you really feel that $195k is justified, or are you just trying to cover your mortgage? If you feel it's justified, can you explain how you arrived at that conclusion?  The comps to your northeast are killing you... there's a 2/2 and a 3/2 both listed for tens of thousands less than your asking price. They're ugly on the outside (in my opinion) but very nice on the inside."
RealEstate,3dz3ws,squishykins,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:28:45 2015 UTC,"The comps that you're referring to are townhomes.  Does a detached structure not make that much of a difference?  We are at 195 right now because, yes we want to cover our mortgage, but that is also below tax value."
RealEstate,3dz3ws,California_Viking,4,Tue Jul 21 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"My apologies! I was looking at this listing and although it looks like a single family at first glance, you're right that it is a townhome. Still, it's got an extra bedroom compared to yours and it's listed for $30k less. Earlier I thought I saw a 2/2 for $135k on the same street as the townhome above, but it's not showing up on the map right now.  Tax value often has nothing to do with current market value. NC is actually the example I give when this question comes up, because NC only reassesses property every 8 years. The value assigned to your property right now is supposed to represent the market value as of 1/1/2009. NC counties typically use sale data from 2 or 3 years prior to determine tax value, so the assessed value of your home is based on 2006-2008 sale data, also known as the peak.  If you don't want to or are unable to lower your asking price, have you considered renting?"
RealEstate,3dz3ws,PopcornApocalypse,7,Tue Jul 21 01:26:38 2015 UTC,"Please read everyone's comments I agree with about all of them in my opinion. I will repeat some and be a little harsh, I apologize in advance but you wanted help so...  1) Make sure that there are other websites and avenues it's listed in. Is there a large ethnic community of some sort, advertise in their newspaper. Make sure there is a for sale sign.   2) The ""curb appeal"" is terrible. Bad pictures and honestly bad design of the yard. Those trees look sad and they're blocking the view. You could landscape and pay more money, not sure if it's worth it.  3) No defined back yard, is part of that the side yard? People like fences they like boundaries pets and children this house seems poorly designed for. No garage?  4) Bad color choice in living room. The flooring looks to be tile, what did you put tile throughout? Wood would have been better.  5) not very good painting in kitchen. Why are you trying to match the floor with the wall? Even the border doesn't help. Did you pick ceramic tile or is that stick on?  6)counter tops don't look good on the cabinets really.  What with you and the brown? You have grey counter tops then brownish walls flooring and cabinets. It looks bad. Change the color in the kitchen maybe just white. It looks off.  7) some people don't like laundry rooms in kitchens.   8) you have no bathtub. In California we could call it a half bath. You don't have two bathrooms but one. Also the change looks ugly it's an ugly shower. You actually took value from the property by removing the bathtub and making it that ""shower"".  9) ugly bedroom color. Tile in the bedroom? God I hope it's not stick tile.   10) wood in hallway upstairs YAY. Ugly color paint.  11) you see that nice brown with the hardwood floor bedroom? That is how the other one should be.   12) second bathroom better. Don't like the marble and shower tile color.  13) how old is your roof? It looks like it needs to be repaired.  14) do you even own that side/back wooded yard or is it shared?  15) Your property description isn't very good. It should flow better and give more details. It won't draw anyone to it. I would redo it.  Look at your comps on zillow of recently sold. Most are lower priced. Many have more bedrooms, bathrooms, and are larger.  I found maybe two comps that might support your price, out of 20 or so.  Yet these have hardwood floors throughout, a better roof, a bathtub, better paint, and a better improvements.  Maybe you think all your improvements are great, they're not. Things you can do:  1) drop price 2) and bathtub/ add wood floor. 3) repaint the rooms.  4) rent it out and hope housing prices improve. You take it off the market, get a one year lease, then let tenants know that they're going to be putting it on the market after a year. Hell it might help you get people looking to invest in a rental.  In all honesty I hope you didn't improve the house after you bought it for 191 because you're not going to get your money from many of those upgrades."

RealEstate,3dxrls,celomics,20,Mon Jul 20 12:15:07 2015 UTC,"A mortgage is only one example of a lien on the title.  Let's say for example the property owner had the air conditioning system replaced and didn't pay the contractor for their work.  The contractor would file a lien on the title.  Meaning if the property was ever sold, they would get paid out of the sale proceeds.  This could be true of any contractor who worked on the property and didn't get paid.  There are also tax liens if they didn't pay their taxes, or in rare cases court ordered liens in cases of divorce or unpaid child support.  If the liens exceed the proceeds from the purchase, you, the new owner would also inherit the liens encumbering the title. And if you purchase the property without having them cleared, you wouldn't likely be able to get a mortgage on the property or sell it to anyone else without getting it cleared since they would get the title search you hypothetically didn't.    The title is, like you said, a concept that refers to all of the rights included with the ownership of the property.  The deed is a formal document that provides evidence of ownership and/or lists the rights included.  A lien on the title basically just means you can't make any money off this land until you pay the debtor that filed the lien first."
RealEstate,3dxrls,sensedata,6,Mon Jul 20 12:37:09 2015 UTC,"This is a good explanation. Adding to this, the interest you acquire could also be fractional, so it is best to verify ownership with that title search.   You want to make sure the person who is conveying the property owns what they say they do. You don't want to buy a property from someone only to find out there is 50 percent ownership held by someone else.   Quality of title can also depend on how a previous owner recorded or took title. In something like a ""race"" recording state, a grantor could convey the same property to two different people, and the first one to record is the actual owner.   The scenario you don't want to find yourself in is buying the property from the guy who didn't record, because they will not be able to convey good title. The person who recorded first, in this scenario, would be the one holding title.   There are also ""notice""  and ""race-notice"" states. So the outcome really depends on your state.   It also depends on what type of deed was used to convey the property. Quitclaim, special warranty, or general warranty. Quitclaim comes with no warranties and leaves you the least protected, while general warranty comes with the most protection.   Other encumbrances that would make title unmarketable include zoning violations. If zoning requires a setback of 50ft from the road, and a house is only 40ft, then title is unmarketable until that defect is fixed.   Overall, it gets complicated quick. For a little more history, the traditional process of conveying land was to cut a piece of dirt out of the ground and hand it to the buyer. This acted as delivery of the property. The deed takes the place of the dirt on today's world and acts as that same type of delivery."
RealEstate,3dxrls,modern_markings,4,Mon Jul 20 14:11:41 2015 UTC,"Here in Texas, title companies treat a Quitclaim Deed as a warning there might be an unrecorded title claim.  As a result, few (if any) Texas title companies will insure title with a QC Deed in the chain."
RealEstate,3dxrls,OriginalStomper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:43:29 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Forgive my stupidity, but now i am confused on ""types of deeds"". So there are Quitclaim, Special Warranty, and General Warranty...does the piece of paper (deed) say ""Quitclaim"" at the top?   Why would someone offer a QC Deed, and why would someone accept a QC deed?"
RealEstate,3dxrls,OriginalStomper,4,Mon Jul 20 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, a deed is generally named at the top.  General Warranty means seller warrants that the deed conveys good title, and seller will stand behind that warranty as to all adverse claimants.  This is the strongest warranty of title and thus preferred by Buyers.  A Special warranty Deed contains Seller's warranty of good title, but only against those claiming by, through or under Seller.  This warranty will not oblige Seller to defend title against a claim arising from conduct by a prior owner who preceded Seller.  A Quitclaim Deed includes NO warranty of title.  Seller conveys whatever interest Seller might own in the property, if any.  Seller does not actually promise or represent that Seller owns any interest at all.  QC Deeds are often abused by laymen who think they can convey title without ""wasting"" money on a lawyer, and then find a QC form online.  QC is the preferred form of deed for idiots because it does not include all that confusing ""warranty of title"" legalese the laymen don't understand.  QC deeds very rarely serve a legitimate purpose, as when someone who owns (or is buying) record title via warranty deed wants to tie up a loose end by also obtaining a deed from a potential claimant to the property when nobody wants to test that claim in court."

RealEstate,3dxrls,von_Lutzow,6,Tue Jul 21 04:45:06 2015 UTC,"While there are many examples of why a title might be clouded, I ran into this last year (with names changed):  Bill staked a mining claim in 1887 in a certain mining district in Montana... eventually after perfecting the claim through the patent process, title to the property was passed to him by the federal government. Shortly after the time of patent, Bill granted half of the property to his brother Marcus, but reserved 25% of the mineral rights of the 50% he gave his brother. Bill then went on to lose title to the property via what appears to be a poker game, before dying intestate. Upon Bill's death, his brother Marcus sold his half of the claim, and Bill's half of the claim (without knowing that Bill had lost title) to another gentleman we'll call Randy. Randy's family has owned the claim for the past 100 years, and has only now decided to sell the family cabin. At this point a title search is done, and it comes to light that Marcus sold his property and whoever's property it was that won the poker game... (turns out Phil who won the game also died intestate, but now has approximately 120 heirs via the wonder of reproduction). Phil never asserted his claim to the property and due to a simple oversight (exacerbated by bad record keeping and state GIS inaccuracies), none of his progeny ever knew he had a viable claim to the property.  Fast forward until recently, when a crazy neighbor who is part of the sovereign rights movement filed a patent application on the half of the property in dispute... (Not that this amounts to anything, except more paperwork) but it further muddies the water. Also, said crazy neighbor controls access to the property, and has now closed down the private road used to access it, as he contends his property rights are being infringed upon.  Basically, if seller simply signs the property over to the buyer... there's no guarantee that the buyer would know any of this, which is a great reason to have title work done, and a mineral right's search if there is the slightest chance it may matter."
RealEstate,3dxrls,wamazing,7,Mon Jul 20 18:19:38 2015 UTC,"Although real estate seems like you are buying something physical, you are actually buying ""rights"" which are outlined in the deed. Sometimes this includes physical improvements.  For example when you buy a condo you don't actually own the building, you own the rights to occupy and use a portion of it.  So when you buy a home that has a cloud on the title, that just means someone else still has retained some of the rights they had to the property at one time. This could be a former owner or lien holder.   I used to see deals scuttled at the last second because someone found a lien for back child support or an IRS lien. Property taxes and contractor liens usually are found quicker and not a surprise a the 11th hour.   If you purchase a home with a traditional mortgage you will probably be required to buy 2 title policies - one insures the lender, and one insures you."
RealEstate,3dxrls,OriginalStomper,5,Mon Jul 20 13:20:55 2015 UTC,"At the closing, the title company will have everybody sign a HUD-1 form ""Settlement Statement"" which tells where all the sales proceeds, loan proceeds and closing costs are going, which side they are being charged to, etc.  This will reflect charges against the proceeds for paying off the Seller's mortgage, as well as any other outstanding liens, so that Buyer gets a clean title subject only to Buyer's new mortgage.  Buyer's lender will not fund the deal without the title policy assuring Buyer's lender that it will have a clear first lien with no remaining, more senior liens."

Or there may be a defect in title from the grantor such as him lying through his teeth about owning the property to begin with.   One true case was when a property was sold by a husband and wife, and then it later transpires that the ""wife"" who showed up at closing was actually the husband's mistress. The husband was a long-time client of the closing attorney, who didn't card the ""wife.""

You can, of course, pursue legal and civil cases against her ex-husband and his new wife (they sold you a whole house when they only had the rights to half), but that money may be long gone, and even if it isn't, that legal case is a headache.  A title search and insurance makes this not your problem.   Lastly, title insurance. I know that lenders require this, but how long do you have to have a policy? As long as you have a mortgage?   You pay the premium once, up front, and your policy lasts for as long as you own the house."

Also, my personal rule is never spend more than 1/3 of your monthly income on rent or mortgage.   Read everything you are going to sign.  Make sure to ask questions on anything you aren't sure about.  Considering that rent covers water and sewer it seems really cheap to me when compared to my area.  Good luck!"

RealEstate,3e09n3,icantrange,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:41:37 2015 UTC,If it is a truely hot market with 10-15 offers per house the price you put it at won't matter a ton.  However if a lot of houses on the same street are going on sale together and yours is the least desirable because of quirks that's not good. I might pull back and wait 2 weeks for them to become comps not competition.

The owner never once considered the comps in the area so he wanted way more than the market suggested. The house we bought owner wanted 139k comps in the area were well over 170k. The appraisal came in at 150k."
RealEstate,3e09n3,jorpjomp,3,Tue Jul 21 00:54:17 2015 UTC,"Don't list the same day as neighbors. Wait until the week after.  I'm in the Bay Area, and paid 40% over list price. That's just how it works here.  Look at all the comparables in your area (list / sale). You'll see that the lower you list, the higher the price goes. You're basically preying on false hope. You list your house in the price range that automated systems pick up and email to homebuyers.  The agent is right. The market sets the price. BUT do not accept early offers, unless it is exorbitant, and make sure you are there when the offers are presented.  Smart buyer's agents who get the best price will find out what it is by mentioning a price in front of you and judging your reaction. If you act unimpressed, they push their client to write a bigger number on the offer.  If you're aware of this and don't act like you've never seen money before, you can get some extra % out of that. lol  Edit: also, stage the house well. Don't cheap out on that."

We were taking it over and my wife made the point that if we wait to list then there will be that many fewer buyers, as both houses will presumably be offered on before we even list.  I've never heard of being there when offers are presented.  Around here it seems like you never even lay eyes on the buyer or buyer's agent.  Is that a regional thing?"
RealEstate,3e09n3,jorpjomp,2,Tue Jul 21 14:06:52 2015 UTC,"It's a ""how hot is the market"" thing.  I've met the sellers for a few houses here in the Bay Area, during the process of buying.  Basically you list your house for sale, and on day 7 (usually a Tuesday/Wed.), everyone ""presents"" their offers in person.  Having the buyer show up adds a human aspect and is meant to shame you into GIVING ME YOUR FUCKING HOUSE. FUCKER.  So, uhhh, yeah.  Presenting in person (even just for the agent) is another level of seriousness, in that they're not shotgunning offers to dozens of people.  If a buying agent just e-mails an offer in the Bay Area, it's all but thrown away…. Except in some cases, such as an extremely low priced house that we bid on in Menlo Park, which was snatched up by a cash buyer (~70% over list).  There were 39+ offers and they'd have spent all day presenting.  The house we bought had 12 offers.  Anyway, you're not going to have an issue with ""fewer buyers"".  There's a shitload of buyers who do/don't bid on a house for any number of reasons. When you list at the same time as your neighbor, that give their potential buyers a ""well, there's that other house. let's not go crazy on THIS one.""  Thing is, you want them to go crazy.  You put your house on the market after the other one goes Pending, and now they've gone crazy because they didn't get the last house.  The wife wants the kids to have a dog and the husband is going to go postal if he has to spend another month looking at houses.  How hot is the Portland market?  Are buyers doing contingencies?  There are zero contingencies in the Bay Area.  😭"
RealEstate,3e09n3,paulie725,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:53:42 2015 UTC,"This seems on par with what I've seen in central Texas.  The lower the list price, the more people seem to clamor over it and get into bidding wars.  We're current buyers, so I'm not too familiar with what selling is like, but if your market is hot enough (which it seems to be), I've heard of setting a limit about a week after listing and just assessing all of the offers you've gotten at that point all together, rather than feeling like you need to accept the first decent offer that comes along."
RealEstate,3e09n3,DigitalTips,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, in the Bay Area you take your offers on Day 7-9 and decide which one to accept. It's like clockwork. No house stays on the market for longer than that, unless the sellers are clueless and being greedy with the list price."
RealEstate,3e09n3,icantrange,2,Tue Jul 21 19:55:20 2015 UTC,"Hey! Firstly, good luck on the move/list!   An important thing to remember is that your real estate agent is getting paid no matter what, and the differences in price for him aren't as big a deal. For example...  Suppose you want to list your house at $1,000,000. The agent will see a 3% commission, or .03(1,000,000)= $30,000.   Suppose the agent wants to list your house for $800,000. The agent will see a 3% commission, or .03(800,000)= $24,000.  So, what is a $200,000 difference for you is really only a $6,000 difference for him. Given that it's tougher to sell a house at $1,000,000 than at $800,000 (no matter your market or buyer), he is disincentivized to do the extra work.  That being said, I say you do a little more research on the PPSF, Lot Size, etc. for your neighborhood. Remember, when doing comps, the more recent the sale, the better. Also, I don't have the resources on hand, but there are plenty of formulas where you can add ""x""% for certain features of your house.   Price it at the market value. If buyers want it and if the trend in the area is to bid above list, then it will happen.   Good luck and happy listing!  Disclaimer: I work for a Real Estate Investment Platform ENDVEST.com.

RealEstate,3dzm5z,ajfa,3,Mon Jul 20 20:37:41 2015 UTC,"Hi ajfa,   A second mortgage leaves your first mortgage in place and takes out a new mortgage on your property in addition to the existing one, hence the term ""Second Mortgage."" I've written an article called ""What is a Second Mortgage?"" that I think you may find useful: https://www.besmartee.com/blog/what-is-a-second-mortgage It would not look sketchy to use the same lender who gave you a first loan, to get a second loan. They are in the business of lending, so if you and your home are qualified, they will gladly lend you money and attach another lien on the property. To be sure you are getting the best rate and program, it wont hurt to shop around with 1 or 2 more lenders for good measure, but be careful to not run your credit too much and be sure you conduct your mortgage shopping with different lender/brokers within a short time frame. I've written another article you might like called ""How to Choose a Mortgage Lender."" I explain the broker versus lender route and describe some characteristics in your lender you should look out for to ensure you are working with the right people to get the best rate and program. https://www.besmartee.com/blog/how-to-choose-a-mortgage-lender This one is not easy. You and every one else are looking for the same type of deal. Essentially, a slam dunk. They are out there but boy oh boy you have to be strategic in finding them, and make the winning offer to buying them. In the past, I have spent as much as 2 years looking for a property with a buyer who had specific expectations from the investment. After a dozen or so offers made over those 2 years, we finally got the winning bid! Properties in horrible shape are a good place to start. Check out your own neighborhoods and see if there is a house that's falling apart on a block that is in good condition. Look for REO listings where the lender is the owner and willing to sell at below market prices to get the property off their books. You may need to get a good real estate agent on board who is used to REO listings or investment properties. It may benefit you to find an REO agent who has a relationship with a lender selling distressed properties, and asking THAT agent to be your agent, making them a ""double agent."" They will make twice the commission and therefore be more ""encouraged"" to get the lender to close that deal. I have written another article called ""REO-Real Estate Owned Properties,"" about this topic that you might find useful as well: https://www.besmartee.com/blog/reo-real-estate-owned-properties   Great questions! I hope this helps you out, even if only a little.  Cheers!"
RealEstate,3dzm5z,BeSmartee,2,Mon Jul 20 21:55:45 2015 UTC,Thanks!   Now for 2 more questions:   big properties or small properties? what about a fsbo condo in a well maintained apt tower that satisfies the 1% rule in Chicago?
RealEstate,3dzm5z,BeSmartee,2,Mon Jul 20 22:42:34 2015 UTC,"Big properties or Small properties: Ultimately, when it comes Net Operating Income, money has no biases. If 3 small properties make the same as 1, then you have to determine your level of involvement. If you want to deal with less tenants then buy a bigger property. If you dont mind having multiple tenants, buy smaller ones. Investing is all about the money in the end, so if you are looking for, say a 10% return on your investment, then get your hands on whatever you can without pushing your financial limits. One important thing to note, before jumping in, is find out what the level of demand is in your area for tenants looking for larger properties, and what the demand is for smaller properties. For example, Downtown Los Angeles is mostly full of single, to newly married working professionals. These folks arent looking for large properties, but perhaps a loft, or anywhere from 1-2 bedrooms in a multi-story building with amenities. Im not familiar with the 1% rule in Chicago, but i can tell you that dealing with a seller who is FSBO, and is not well experienced in the world of real estate transactions is something to be concerned about. They essentially act as their own agent, so there is no one to advise them as to best practices, contract negotiations, or whether or not they should accept your offer based on market trends. I find that owners let their emotions get in the way of the business transaction, so if you go into a FSBO deal, just be aware that you might have to be a little more patient than with a sale that deals with agents on both sides. If buying an FSBO property, I would highly recommend using your own agent to be sure you have some one on your side looking out for your best interest."
RealEstate,3dzm5z,BeSmartee,2,Mon Jul 20 23:04:10 2015 UTC,"OK that actually answered my follow-up question.   Here's one more: are there any places where demand for long-term rental of large, up-market SFOs is almost always high?"
RealEstate,3dzm5z,BobaTFett,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:56 2015 UTC,"Hi ajfa,  Im not familiar with the acronym SFO, but I will try to answer the question because I think I know where your heading.  I find that places with the highest demand to rent larger properties as a residence (assuming single family homes with multiple bedrooms and bathrooms are considered large rentals) are usually in growing cities close to a metropolis. For example, there are many smaller cities and neighborhoods surrounding Downtown Los Angeles that have excellent schools and parks, very low crime rates and neighborhood friendly businesses to suit many different tastes. These areas have seen a dramatic rise in real estate prices in the last 20+ years and have therefore priced many people out of the market. For this reason, many families who desire to live in said neighborhoods are willing to pay several thousand dollar a month to rent a large home for their growing family to take advantage of the schools, parks, safety and lifestyle.  Look for places like this if you are in the market to buy a rental property an entire family, or business professional can move into.   Hope this helps!  Cheers"
RealEstate,3dzm5z,BeSmartee,2,Tue Jul 21 22:39:36 2015 UTC,"This helps out a lot, thanks!  So here's a question: what is the long-term penalty for finding properties that are not ""super bargains""?, but rather break even and don't cash-flow especially well?  Is it that in markets that don't cash-flow, they'll never cash flow? Or that all properties should inherently cash-flow and ones that don't are by definition overpriced?  For example, with a bit of persistence it's pretty easy to find an enormous home that needs a bit of work, but is otherwise ~$200k under appraised value. Great for unlocking equity! One tenant brings in a lot of cash, low maintenance. If you've chosen wisely the home will basically hold its value forever. However, these tend to be hard to cash flow.   On the other hand the biggest cash flow returns seem to come from smaller units and multis, which is great in the short term but a lot can happen to those buildings over 15 years. Also, lots of tenants, high turnover, lots of work.    Is there a ""right"" strategy? Is a mixture of both good?"

RealEstate,3e0ifs,NumNumLobster,3,Tue Jul 21 02:51:01 2015 UTC,"A few to consider:    Corporate Real Estate -  Generally you work with brokers to select and analysis sites, negotiate leases & renewals, etc for some corporate entity.  This can vary wildly based on the size of the company.  Someone like Star Bucks for example would have a very large department with many people working that at all experience levels.  Someone with less locations may have one person that handles everything RE related.    Commercial Brokerage-  You represent landlords, tenants, buyers, and sellers to help them in their RE.  Generally 100% commission.  You can make a ton here or nothing.  Property Management-  You take care of the daily things that come up on properties.  Typical duties are leasing, over seeing maintenance, budgeting, planning for future capital items, collecting rent & resolving disputes, paying bills, etc.    Appraisal-  You figure out what stuff is work.  Heavy analysis.  Usually lots of travel.    Lending-  Lots of jobs here from mortgage brokerage to underwriting.    Asset Management-  Generally this is about a step up from Property Management but the two can get intertwined sometimes.  You are usually managing the asset more from a fiscal perspective as part of a larger portfolio.  You'd be responsible for stuff like refinancing, selling, buying, re positioning, etc.    Analysts-  Typically work for investment funds, or larger brokers.  Its a generic title that can mean all kinds of things, but generally you look at transactions and provide reports etc on them for other people to use in decision making or negotiations.   There are probably more but those all come to mind as careers people typically get into with finance degrees"

RealEstate,3dzakj,DeezNeezuts,5,Mon Jul 20 19:14:42 2015 UTC,"My understanding is paying extra to your mortgage is essentially guaranteeing you a return of the interest rate (though rather than ""gaining"" money, it's simply money you're not paying in interest).

Put some money in a index fund and see what does better  - the index fund or your 4%."
RealEstate,3dzakj,miketeeeveee,2,Tue Jul 21 01:12:35 2015 UTC,"It seems like you are getting emotionally weighted advice. The pros of paying off the mortgages is that you will experience being debt free (assuming you have no other debt). This can be quite freeing and fulfilling to some people. Now, a big chunk of your income can be used however you want, it is not already spoken for. A second advantage would be if there was a market correction and you had not invested that money in the market. You would have a 4% return on your money while those invested in the market would have negative returns.  The pro of not paying off your mortgage is that you could invest that money in the market (or fix your roof, or buy a car or whatever).

What makes you think that a desirable single story home will be available weeks after you see it?   I've spoken with people who say it's not unreasonable to sell a home, and rent it from the buyer for a specified period of time.   You might fid somebody who will go for that, but the majority of buyers want to buy because they want to live in it. I know that when I was looking for a home, I completely discarded listings that wanted 90-120 day after close posession.   How much should we pay them each month? Should we use the current mortgage payment as a guide, since it includes the property tax, or should we pay more, since this is an imposition?   Rent needs to be based on their mortgage, not yours, because they are the ones who will be paying every month. I promise that their mortgage will be higher than what you're paying right now.    Should we check with the township to see if the lot can be subdivided, or leave it to the potential buyer?    Leave it to the new buyer. Somebody might want a larger lot, or it might be more desirable for developers (who might actually go for a rentback).   I want to have at least two different home inspectors come out for each house we're serious about.   If I counted all the buyers I've seen do this on my thumbs, I'd still have 2 spares.  So how about this as an alternative: Sell the old place. Find an inexpensive 6 month rental in your target city. Learn the area in your target city before you buy anything. Buy a new place at your leisure instead of in a rush.  Good luck."

When I got one for my first house ages ago the PMI was waived and no down payment was required. The problem is that once you buy your house for what is assumed to be current market value, you are immediately underwater as the loan is written for 2% over the actual value to account for fees.   The FHA loan is a good option but the way they have them set up now is that the PMI never drops off! What a drag. I personally think everyone would go USDA but not every qualifies or is in the correct area.   Hope this helps and also that someone more knowledgeable comes along to lend a hand!"

RealEstate,3dy7pd,landofmisfits,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:46:40 2015 UTC,"You can also go with a conventional loan over those other 2 types with as little as 3% down.  I closed on my house in June and ended up putting down 5%, just because it cut the PMI in half.  The bonus is that I can get the PMI withdrawn once I have the mortgage under 80% LTV without having to refi.  With the interest rate I got, I really didn't want to be stuck with PMI for the life of the loan or have to refi not knowing what the rates will be in a few years.    As far as a zero % down goes, I would avoid that honestly because it could easily make it so that it takes a while to have equity built into the home, and if a market crash of home values in your area happen you may find yourself under water should you have to sell sooner than you plan.   And of course, if you have a good enough credit score, even 3% will get you a good interest rate.  (Not sure what today's rates are, but we got 3.875% with the 5% down conventional and would have been the same with 3%)"
RealEstate,3dy7pd,meandrunkR2D2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:21:58 2015 UTC,"USDA over FHA IMO,  PMI does drop off at 80% equity, and just because they are offering a 0% down payment option, doesn't mean you can't put a down payment, it just means you don't have to.    Financially, the best option is to put 20% down and not have PMI at all, but if that is not an option, look at some amortization calculators and see who the amount of down payment you can put down and see how it affects the monthly payment as well as the amount you pay back over the life of the loan."
RealEstate,3dy7pd,landofmisfits,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 20 percent isnt realistic for us currently, so PMI is part of the equation regardless.

And yes, it definitely makes sense to have an emergency fund, especially when you own a house, and generally speaking you are only talking about $5/month in payment for every $1000 financed.    IMO the best thing to do is go with the 0% down and pay biweekly or make a principle payment once a year (equal to your regular monthly payment), it will save both interest and time on the loan, and allow you to keep your emergency fund.."

RealEstate,3dvysl,naughtyadamw,9,Mon Jul 20 00:02:24 2015 UTC,"Number one is to establish the ""basis at the time of conversion"". Your basis for depreciation is not how much you paid or owe, the depreciable improvements iris based in the date that you converted the house to a rental. This does not have to be a certified appraisal, but I would keep some documentation on the retail value of your house at the time you converted.   This would also be an excellent time to familiarize yourself with the Schedule E,  If in the U.S.  Create a system to track every expense including mileage and categorize the expenses based on the Schedule E. This will save you hours of book keeping at tax time. Keep a mileage log.   Secondly, switch your homeowners insurance over to a landlord policy. In Florida this could be up to half price. You want at least $300,000 liability but that's hard to find here in Florida. Also note that landlord insurance covers personal property so be sure to ask how much PP coverage you have. Think of the stove and any other appliances that you're leaving in the house.   Depreciation on the schedule E is tricky because you can't take the land on depreciation. And appliances depreciate faster than the overall improvements and if you do a new fence that might depreciate at en entirely different rate.   Might be a really really good time to plan ahead with your accountant, if applicable.   Welcome to the world of rentiers!"

Estimate that your maintenance and repair costs will be 1-2% of your annual payments.  Talk to an accountant about the anticipated tax consequences. Be sure your rent received covers the cost of any tax consequences, management fees, and maintenance.  Set up a recordkeeping system that allows you to track your expenses.  If you're out of state, locate a good property manager and be sure they do on-site inspections at least once during each one-year lease term.

You can google 'foundation' and 'hydrostatic pressure'. You must ( 100% MUST ) get in the crawl/basement and check for mold. Damp soil, if not properly sealed away using a vapor barrier, will cause mold to grow. Also termites. Be sure to get a good termite inspection. Termites loves moisture.    I have a damp lot too due to being downhill from another house ( downpsouts constantly pouring on me ) so I do this:   Treat for termites (myself) every 2 years. The chemical is the same on that the pro's use (termidor), its cheap if you DIY.  Created a sealed crawlspace so no soil moisture harms my building structure. This is a full day project but its fairly cheap if you DIY. You can google 'sealed crawlspaces'. Graded the backyard ( added shallow ditch or swale ) to be super sure the water went AROUND my house. You can dig manually or with the help of a tiller. Then you just replant some grass.   One final tip ( and it is a GOLDEN one that will truly save you and everyone who has drainage or grading concern when looking to buy ):   Visit the house when its raining. You will see where the water is flowing. If its all flowing AWAY from your house and into the city storm drains or down the street, and not pooling up against it, then you know the grading is sound. Most likely, all is fine. But you can only KNOW if you visit during a rain."

RealEstate,3dvfep,bnasso,4,Sun Jul 19 21:17:33 2015 UTC,"Im guessing the first step would be to get pre-approved?   Yes. You also want to start talking to buyers agents in your target city.   And if that is the case is it best, or the only option, to get pre-approved from a bank or credit union from the city of Savannah? Or are there reputable online mortgage lenders? Or can a bank from my city where I live now pre-approve us for a house 16 hours away?   Use somebody there. Somebody in your state may not be licensed in your target state. A good agent can recommend a reliable mortgage broker that she has worked with and that she trusts to get the job done. Online lenders, as a rule of thumb, are perfectly fine for refinancing but are not time-sensitive enough for a purchase.    We have seen a house we both absolutely agree on for us to buy now and possible rent out the upstairs to supplement our mortgage.   I say this a lot, but never ever fall in love with a house you don't own. There are so many things that can happen between seeing a pretty picture online and signing the closing documents. You don't even know that the property in question will be available when you get there.   I know it sounds crazy to some of buying a house without first walking though, but if we get to that point we will make time for it.   It's crazy to make an offer on a property you haven't been inside of. Short version: smells don't photograph worth a darn. Do not even think about just making an offer before going inside that property. If that means you have to move to town and put everything in storage for a few months while you look for, make offers on, do inspections on, and eventually close on a home, so be it!  You might check out the FAQ. The section for new homebuyers has plenty of information that will help you out.  Congrats on the transfer and good luck."

So, would he be able to find someone for us or would it be best to find someone else from a different company altogether? And once I contact a buyers agent, would they be able to check the house out for us before we move down there or visit?

RealEstate,3dvfep,ShortWoman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:11:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, you do want your own agent. Since 99% of agents are independent contractors, it does not matter whether that agent is with the same company as the listing agent. Many buyers agents can indeed check out a property on your behalf (I've done it more than once), but they won't be able to bring an inspector with them. An inspector is going to cost several hundred bucks a pop, so you generally don't schedule him until you've got an accepted contract (there are a few exceptions not worth discussing here). There's still no substitute for touring the property yourself.  Hope this is helpful."

There are SO many things that could go wrong!  You can make almost anything look pretty in pictures but there is no substitute for examining the bricks & mortar.    I think you should consider finding an agent in the area to give you some guidance.  Perhaps rely on some referrals from your new place of employment to point you in the right direction."

For example if his credit history consisted of 1 credit card for 13 months, and 2 lates of 30 days or more showing up... wouldn't surprise me if Fannie/Freddie's software spit back that they wanted 2 years history for someone that managed to screw up twice within in 13 short months of having credit."

RealEstate,3dujt6,9bikes,5,Sun Jul 19 22:23:15 2015 UTC,Netflix insurance etc etc none of that matters.   Credit = Loans and lines of credit such as credit cards.  Credit is not Every day bills like netflix or car insurance or comcast phone or rent etc etc  The only chance you have of getting a mortgage in the near future is either A. with a Cosigner B. You cheat your credit by getting added to someone with a long credit history's credit card. C. You have collateral for a hard money loan.  I recommend none of the above though. I suggest you go out and get a secured loan right this very moment and start building credit or a secured credit card. Alliant credit union gives some decent long term secured loans for credit building Probably be at least two years before you'll be able to get a mortgage going this route but youll be able to do it all on your own.  Since you do not understand credit yet I'm guessing your fairly young. I would recommend start building your credit and saving a sizable downpayment. You may also consider going my route and saving up 10-20k and buying a cheaper house in the ghetto with cash and living there rent free for a few years while you build credit / save more money in the end youll get a rental out of it and more cash then you would otherwise have.

RealEstate,3dujt6,Amarin88,7,Sun Jul 19 17:35:33 2015 UTC,"Also please stay away from things like rent to own and pay day loans etc those rarely report anything but negative to credit. Get you one secured loan, wait like 3-6 months then apply for a credit card like discover it or chase freedom or just about any credit card that does not have a annual fee. Buy things you would normally buy with the credit card they typically pay you like 1% for using them  don't let more then 8% of your total credit report to the statement and after you get your statement pay off the balance completely before your next statement You'll never pay interest and in about 2 years you'll have damn near perfect credit."
RealEstate,3dujt6,mrsentinel,2,Sun Jul 19 17:42:36 2015 UTC,Rent to own is an enormous scam that preys on people who can't qualify for a mortgage. They put 10 to 15% down and if they don't make payments then you can boot them out way easier than a mortgage. The owner gets to keep the down payment and got monthly mortgage payments out of the deal as well.
RealEstate,3dujt6,rodneyachance,2,Sun Jul 19 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"This is the same advice that you are getting but with one change. If you have some money saved got to a local bank and use some cash as a CD-secured loan. You put 500 or 1500 in a CD and borrow the same amount gainst it. Then pay it back monthly. You won't have a credit card to tempt you to buy shit you cannot afford and you can get these sorts of loans with shit- or no credit. TL;DR  To build credit, put some money in a CD and borrow the same amount using the CD as collateral."
RealEstate,3dujt6,DeezNeezuts,2,Sun Jul 19 23:51:18 2015 UTC,"Can you throw out more details about your financial situation?  Yearly income, amount you can put down - all of this might be affecting your ability to receive a loan."

I rented the houses out for only about a year or so before selling them which helped earn about 12k per year in rental income. It is a huge investment, but it will pay off in the end.

Ask family to add you to their credit cards (assuming they are financially solid). As an authorized user, you get less of a benefit than having your name on it directly.

No guarantee that it would work, but I've noticed that credit reports sometimes look a heck of a lot like a newly authorized user inherits the full credit history of that card in some cases."
RealEstate,3dujt6,aardy,2,Sun Jul 19 17:38:55 2015 UTC,"Yep this is the case and its a valid option but if you do this, A. make sure you never actually get a card so you can never be accused of using  it.

Her only job is to check paperwork.  Your job is to market the property, pay the buyer's agent, get buyers in to look at it, put it on all the websites and MLS, negotiate with the buyer's agent, and so on."
RealEstate,3dwldr,jmd_forest,5,Mon Jul 20 06:06:19 2015 UTC,"For those saying you're in the wrong place, they can crawl back under their rock. The filter for this sub states:   Financing | First Time Homebuyer | Buying | Selling | Investor | Landlord | Rental   There's not a damn thing about agents in it.  I've sold a few FSBOs and its simply not that hard. The following is a high level guide: For paperwork, you could start with a local title company; some of them will provide a ""Owners Package"" with paperwork and a description of the process to guide you through. Also, a RE Lawyer (not a divorce lawyer, corporate lawyer, criminal lawyer, etc,etc, etc, but a RE LAWYER) can help with the paperwork for likely between $300 - $1000. Next item is to price your property correctly. Research the sold prices in your neighborhood of similar homes using publicly available sources such as Zillow, your local county tax board web site, your municipal web site. You may even need to visit your town hall as they likely have records of sales. Then price your home comparatively given the features of you home vrs the sold homes.  Alternately you can hire an appraiser to give you a professional opinion.  The next step is preparing your house for market. Simply put, thin out the crap in your house and then fix and beautify everything. Make sure you have the best curb appeal possible. Marketing your house is the next step and is where most FSBOs fail as you will need to invest  money ( generally anywhere from $1k to $3k) and time in marketing the property. Get professional signs done. I found one or 2 professional banners plus a few signs worked well. Advertise in the local papers, hold well advertised open houses, use directional signs to drive traffic past your property.  There are books and web sites dedicated to this subject. Do yourself a favor and invest some time in educating yourself on it and you should be fine."

RealEstate,3dwldr,jmd_forest,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:06:34 2015 UTC,I am not asking real estate agents for advice.  If I'm in the wrong area to ask those interested and experienced in real estate transactions for advice would you kindly point me in the proper direction?
RealEstate,3dwldr,jmd_forest,-7,Mon Jul 20 04:14:05 2015 UTC,Then why come here?   You've made it abundantly clear your distaste for agents. Yet come into a forum almost exclusively populated by people with a RE license and proceed to harass someone that told you you came to the wrong place.   Real estate is not something as simple as you seem to think and in some states would be illegal for you to sell.   (And I'm saying this not as an agent but simply someone whose recently become a REI/REOC)
RealEstate,3dvlxo,SIcmart,2,Sun Jul 19 22:12:18 2015 UTC,"I would think something like that would only end up being enforced via a complaint. Such as, the original owner sells off a portion of land but is still right next door and can see what is going on, and knows about the restriction, so they can complain. Although, I just got back from a weekend in a small Utah town, and I can see something like that being a well-known fact if it is common in the area. I sure as hell wouldn't buy a place with that kind of restriction lol."

RealEstate,3dvlae,jellybeann88,7,Sun Jul 19 22:06:54 2015 UTC,"Don't stress until you know the amount of the assessment. If they're on the large-ish side, they usually drag them out over time with installment payments being made. Only when you know the full amount & terms will you be able to decide if it's worth it to you to remain. You're going to make yourself sick with worry & this is a situation  you can do nothing about until you have the full information at hand. You can't worry over things you can't control, you just have to roll with the punches & adjust. It sounds like you love the home, it will probably be worth keeping, but only you can make that call when you get complete information.  Until then, try & relax a little bit..."
RealEstate,3dvlae,ShinyLightning,3,Sun Jul 19 22:25:40 2015 UTC,The only thing I would add to this is that it may be worth showing up to HOA meetings and becoming an active participant.
RealEstate,3dvlae,aardy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:48:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, we actively participate in HOA meetings. This has been going on for over a year - our initial approved assessment was for a $1.9 million loan (it was originally going to be $1.2, but then they discovered more damage). Our monthly assessment is currently ~$300 over a period of 10 years, something we are comfortable paying. Our neighbor (and president of the HOA board) just informed my husband that the city is going to condemn the stairwells in the buildings, adding more repairs (that already include: repairing water damage, waterproofing the buildings, new roof and siding). His estimate is that the new repairs will result in costs in the low $3-million range. This is currently what we know."
RealEstate,3dvlae,aardy,2,Sun Jul 19 23:12:55 2015 UTC,How would that condo unit fare as a rental property?
RealEstate,3dvlae,aardy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:23:57 2015 UTC,"It would definitely rent well, but unfortunately the number of rentals allowed is capped by the HOA, and the leasing limit has been hit."
RealEstate,3dvlae,ShinyLightning,5,Sun Jul 19 23:29:41 2015 UTC,"Present the following facts to the next HOA board meeting:   Everyone in this room is about to face a tough choice, given what we've recently discovered about the new HOA bills we're all going to be faced with. This giant HOA bill is going to instantly drop home values. Period, end of story, get over it and accept it. A $700/month HOA bill means that buyers will expect there to be a boat dock on the water, but all we've got to offer is the promise of new stairs. Every single one of us will think about walking away, at least briefly, now that we are underwater or close to it. If people start walking and getting foreclosed on, all of our collective condo values will start to tank. The first ones to short-sale or walk or sell will get harmed the least, the last ones standing will be screwed. Musical chairs.  This will create a vicious downward spiral, encouraging even more people to walk/sell/short-sale, which screws all of us. The only alternative, for those of us feeling this squeeze, is to rent our condos out. If more of us can rent, there will be less walking, and our asset values are protected. The rental cap needs to be increased, with those of us underwater (or close to it) on our mortgages getting first dibs.  This protects the home values of those with lots of equity, and gives those of us underwater (or close to it) a viable alternative to walking (and trashing everyone's home values)."
RealEstate,3duylu,kermit1969,2,Sun Jul 19 18:54:49 2015 UTC,"But the THIRD offer uses the exact same rates, same amount of points (0), but a total out-the-door closing cost estimate that is $1,800 less than my original offer. Even the monthly payment estimate is $8/mo less, due to a slightly lower insurance estimate. The large difference in closing costs comes mostly from the ""origination fees"" and a bit from the ""title fees"".   Bait and switch.    Homeowner's insurance. You shop for this, not your lender, so what is on the GFE is in no way legally binding. If you want to save $8/month on your homeowners insurance, go shop for HOI that is $8 cheaper. Nothing to do with lender.  Title/escrow fees. Again, you technically have the right to shop for this. So what is on the GFE is not legally binding. Just like above, has nothing to do with lender.    There are also things called ""valid changes of circumstance."" Loan officer can call anything a 'valid change of circumstance,' and then have a 'valid' reason to redisclose with accurate fees a week before close of escrow (he knew the accurate fees from day one, but needed to hook you first).   The GFE is supposed to be this wonderful thing that you can use to shop for the best deal, but in reality there are soooo many loopholes that it means about jack squat at the nickle-and-dime level of a couple grand. Interest rate and loan program generally must be accurate, the rest means f-all until the final redisclosure a week before close of escrow.  If it's a lender that has a relationship with your realtor, there is accountability because you tell your realtor on the lender and then the realtor never sends business his way again. Zero accountability for lawful bait and switches if it's a out of town or big bank lender."
RealEstate,3duylu,aardy,2,Sun Jul 19 19:12:11 2015 UTC,"But presumably, the original offer could ALSO pull a lawful bait and switch? Or perhaps that is less likely, because she is simply more honest and will stick to her numbers.   In any case it sounds like GFEs are a useful guidepost but that it mostly comes down to picking somebody you trust.  I do really trust my realtor (old family friend) and he is the one who recommended that I get the GFE that resulted in the lowest offer. And combined with your point that he would have some accountability to my agent, it seems like a no brainer to go with low offer and hope for the best."

RealEstate,3dw3f6,RonDerpundy,6,Mon Jul 20 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, but you can also be OK with overpaying."
RealEstate,3dw3f6,hamhead,5,Mon Jul 20 00:45:12 2015 UTC,"Financing, if applicable, will be based on the lesser of appraised value or purchase price.   Example:   You want to put 20% down. Purchase price $500k. Appraised value $450k.  Lender is going to look at the $450k, but seller wants $500k. So loan + down needs to equal $500k.  If you borrow $400k and put $100k down, lender is going to do 1 - ($400k / $450k) and call it 11% down. Mortgage insurance required, and interest rate adjusted. You're going to feel like you put 20% down, but aren't getting what you are supposed to get for saving up 20%.  If you borrow $360k and put $140k down, lender is going to do 1 - ($360k / $450k) and call it 20% down. No mortgage insurance required, great interest rate.  But from your perspective, you had to put 28% down when you only wanted to put 20% down."
RealEstate,3dw3f6,aardy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:49:40 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the information.  I was wondering how the financing would work if the appraisal came in at less than the agreed purchase price.  The appraisal hasn't been done.  I'd rather not leave it up to chance about how the financing will be affected by the appraisal and instead stay at my current offer (which I feel is safer), but I'll have to balance that with how badly we want this house."
RealEstate,3dw3f6,jorpjomp,5,Mon Jul 20 00:57:29 2015 UTC,"You could try your luck with waiting.  Come back in 30-days.  Failing that, you could always go with a dirty trick. Go into escrow with an appraisal contingency. When the appraisal comes in low, demand that they lower the price.  When a house falls out of escrow, it tends to look bad and people ask questions. So the selling agent may then work against the seller to push them to come down in price. That may work since they even agreed that it's overpriced."
RealEstate,3dw3f6,alchemy3083,3,Mon Jul 20 03:17:51 2015 UTC,"You can, and that's your choice.  But I don't think that's the most important question here.  You made an offer on a house, got it refused, and the owner came back several days later with a request for a new offer.  Were it me, I'd make another offer for $5k less than the original offer you made and see what happens.  (Assuming the original offer you made was reasonable for the property and comps.  Otherwise I might go much lower...)  I really can't imagine them reaching out to you and fishing for a new offer so soon unless they played the ""best and final"" game and all of their buyers walked away.  You're not in a hurry so you can afford to play a little hard here."

RealEstate,3dvbk0,FUSE_33,3,Sun Jul 19 20:44:18 2015 UTC,Hmm I was under the impression that if you went from a job in one field to a  job in the same field that the wait was much shorter for them to approve the loan then say the two year wait if you change fields. As for the contract work They should be able to look at two years worth of w2's again long as its the same field of work.
RealEstate,3dvbk0,Amarin88,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"That's the big issue with the W2's.  I'm in the same field of work, just different type of employment.  What I understand is that if I was a contractor in MD with 2 years of history it would be a non-issue.  I was told it's because I was a FTE before, and now I'm a contractor.  So all those W2's as a FTE have no bearing on my current employment as a contractor."
RealEstate,3dvbk0,Amarin88,2,Sun Jul 19 21:30:28 2015 UTC,Oh one more thing. If the employment thing stays a issue I suggest looking for a company that offers a lease to own kind of deal Youll pay more money in the short term but you can get in a house you like and then after two years refinance it with a bank

I said hey, what if I get her to co-sign, use the stocks as colateral. Everyone said nope, the loan approvals are based off of income, not whats in our banks.   I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole with a condom on the end because I value my license, but I believe Bank of Internet does Asset Depletion Alt-QM ""barely legal"" loans like it's still 2007. All ARMs, and all at atrocious interest rates ('normal' interest rates if we pretend it's still 2007 - 6% and 8% realm).   Another alternative of course is hard money lenders at 10%+.

RealEstate,3dv1xq,arpus,3,Sun Jul 19 19:22:43 2015 UTC,"My GUESS after being involved with a historic commission and doing a fair amount of dancing while having a fair number of 1910 era buildings is that the pergolas and interior layout would be zero problem.  Nothing structural about the interior layout work? Question the need for a permit.  AC no problem.  New windows may be a problem, but if kept the same location and same size should be ok (thinking historic on the 1922 house).    Adding bedrooms I would expect a flat denial, as you are increasing the potential # of bodies in an already overloaded lot.  City wants SF in that area, you already have multiple families, and now you want yet bigger families? kinda thinking Auto-No."
RealEstate,3dv1xq,calmloki,2,Sun Jul 19 20:29:03 2015 UTC,"This can vary by city. You need to reach out to your zoning office and clarify.   In my area, legal non-conforming means you can keep it as-is for now, and no one will make you tear it down. But if it is destroyed for any reason it can't be rebuilt. You could update it like adding the AC but they won't let you alter the footprint.   You could also seek a variance, which would make the 2-family legal, but again this depends on what is going on in your area. In areas of gentrification you might get away with this.   Also in my area, most single family residential zoning districts allow for main house + one accessory unit, so, are you positive about what the zoning you are in? I would check with your city and clarify if you haven't already."
RealEstate,3dv1xq,wamazing,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:44:56 2015 UTC,"Typically, the grandfathered nonconformity for two units is just for the use, not the size. So, from a legal use, it wouldn't matter if a unit had 1 bedroom or 5; it's still one dwelling unit.  That said, additions of square footage will need to be designed to meet current setbacks and height limits. And, if your city has a lot coverage limit, you'd be held to that. e.g. Not more than 40% of the lot can be covered with buildings. Usually only bigger urban areas have that..  If I owned a grandfathered use, I'd ask the city planning department for a signed letter stating that it's legal, non-conforming. You never know when a loan officer will want proof.  Plus, you want to define whether the grandfathered use is for two units (a duplex) or for an accessory dwelling unit (commonly, ADU's). That might make a difference if it's an ADU that is required to be smaller than the main home.  Make an appointment to sit with a city planner - you'll get more info than just showing up to the building permit counter.  Good luck!"

I can't imagine you won't get hefty damages there (if you can collect them).  On the other hand I'd not want that to happen to my shit so I'd probably try to negotiate this before hand if possible or just bail if another opportunity presents itself.

In my state the landlord has no right to be on the property (without proper notice) let alone his dad.  Seems like you need to find some legal help. They can't take your stuff out of your home. If they do it's theft and vandalism. Basically you need to be prepared to act as if you're squatting. Except that you have an actual lease and are not in any way squatting.   I would lock up the stuff in the back yard. If they didn't tell you he was storing it there then he has no right to put it there. If there's any problem tell him you were keeping it safe.

It's basically when they make the property so undesirable to live in that you move out on your own accord, thus avoiding evicting you through proper channels.    Constructive eviction is a term used in the law of real property to describe a circumstance in which a landlord either does something or fails to do something that he has a legal duty to provide (e.g. the landlord refuses to provide heat or water to the apartment), rendering the property uninhabitable.   Look into tenants rights organizations in your county.   Good luck!"
RealEstate,3dros0,smallls,11,Sat Jul 18 22:19:26 2015 UTC,"I am a paralegal (not a lawyer) in New Jersey (where you are) and deal with this all the time.  He can't just move in or take your stuff out. It's against the law AND you can file a civil suit for which he has no defense.    If he does do this (and some people are dumb enough to do this), you can immediately go to court and say you were the victim of a self-help eviction and need an ""Emergent Hearing"" for an ""Order to Show Cause"".  It's a very simple form and the Judge will order you restored to the premises immediately, with police assistance if necessary.  OTSC's are heard immediately, usually within an hour.  You won't be standing around waiting all day.    The civil suit is separate.  I've seen people get $50,000 + for having this happen to them. It all depends what their damages are.  We had one case where a guy left for vacation and when he came home two weeks later the super was living in his apartment and all his stuff was gone.  He's the one who got over 50K.  Another woman's landlord locked her out after getting in a fight with her and she got $1,500 for being locked out for about an hour and a half.  It is no joke in NJ.  Some towns will even arrest the landlord, others won't be bothered. If your stuff gets touched by him, he is going to be paying through the nose.  Since he owns real estate, you can get a lien on it and eventually foreclose if he doesn't pay.  Or you docket the judgment in Tenton and you will get paid when he goes to sell the property (it shows up in the title search).  He can't break your lease to move in.  In fact, when it's over he can refuse to renew your lease but that still doesn't mean he can automatically move in.  You still have a valid tenancy, just month to month.  Even at this point you can fight his wanting to occupy the premises as you are renting a single family home and are basically a tenant for life as long as you pay the rent and don't violate the terms of your lease ... which is STILL in effect, just month to month ... not year to year. Eventually he would win on the personal occupancy issue as long as he actually intends to occupy the home, but you could probably get him to pay you to leave.  Most landlords make errors in service of the notice or in language used in the notice and if you have a good lawyer, you can get the case dismissed and he has to start over again.  i.e. He gives you notice (faulty).  You don't move.  He files.  You wait for the court date.  At court your lawyer points out the defect.  Case dismissed.  Lather, rinse, repeat."

That being said, it is true the majority of licensees do absolutely nothing. This is due to an easy barrier to entry and the fact it can be extremely hard to make a sale. I blame the limited barrier to entry as to why there is such a lack of trust in agents. Most new agents, and specifically those trying to start a career, get out at a very fast pace because of the difficulty. If you are a buyer/seller working with one of these agents, you have chosen someone with virtually no experience, and likely won't make it. No wonder you see so many complaints on these subs."

Now that the market is so hot,  I have considered stepping up my game,  but I kind of like how much attention I can give to a transaction when I do one at a time.    Edit: I should also say,  even for 2 houses a year,  it is a license worth having. Husband and I have made some great investments fairly young,  because my license earned us a commission that helped offset the cost of down payment.  The friends and family have always been a handy 5k when we needed it.  It costs about 2k per year to stay fully active in my state (NAR dues,  MLS dues, Docusign, continuing ed) and every January I think about backing out and by June I always thank god I didn't.

The recession, cultural factors, and the fickleness of the modern job market (outside the bay area) has made many people permanent renters. This means great things for RE as a long-term investment.

RealEstate,3dr4xg,shuddertostink,10,Sun Jul 19 14:04:43 2015 UTC,"Rental property income showing up on anything other than the real estate portion of Schedule E has some unique quirks when trying to qualify for conventional GSE mortgage financing (eg, decent interest rates).  Portions in bold below are the differences.  Not schedule E real estate owned, that is NOT broken down by property:   If a given property has a net positive cash-flow, that income is disregarded because it is presumed to already show up as part of your reported income. It will be calculated this way regardless of if this reflects reality. If a given property has a net negative cash-flow, that net negative number is regarded as a debt.   Schedule E real estate owned, broken down by property:   If a given property has a net positive cash-flow, that income can be used as qualifying income. If a given property has a net negative cash-flow, that negative number is regarded as a debt.   As you can see, tax returns that do not break it down by property (which this exact schedule E form does: http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f1040se.pdf ) leads to more conservative and less precise underwriting because the tax returns you filed and provided are less precise.   If you want to get into the weeds, look at 'step 3' of BOTH the below and compare...  FNMA ""individial"" rental income from investment properties, that can be used if tax returns break it down by property: https://www.fanniemae.com/content/guide_form/1038.pdf  FNMA ""business"" rental income from investment properties, that must be used if tax returns do not break it down by property: https://www.fanniemae.com/content/guide_form/1039.pdf  If you are thinking of setting up an LLC, it may be worth paying to have your CPA prepare ""hypothetical"" 2014 tax returns as an LLC. Walk into your loan officer's office with both the hypothetical 2014 tax returns, and your actual 2014 returns w/ schedule E. Have her run the numbers and let you know what the implications are.

You'll lose some to nail removal or glue, and then you have to try to make it all work together again without leaving ridges and bumps.

No way would I try to remove and reinstall that stuff. Besides, you can buy all new laminate at Home Depot for under $1/sf. Why not just install new if laminate doesn't bother you? As far as carpet, a lot of people feel it's ""disgusting"" if it's not brand new (because germs, hard to clean, etc) so maybe if you go that route wait until right before you move."

And i wouldn't invest much, maybe only 20 to 30k for a nice apartment.. but yeah you're right, they have that 70 yr lease and you lose it after that. The only issue with holding onto it is my lack of cash, i really have less than 8k cash to my name and if the next tenants don't pay rent or screw the place up, it could take up everything I've got before I'm able to rent it again. Do you think in my situation its a bit risky to hold onto it given my finances? I would love to keep it if i could afford it and theoretically i could, but i just feel like totally unforeseen emergencies and issues happen with the house all the time.

Property in California WILL NOT GET CHEAPER. If you sell it, then you could easily get priced out of the market forever. The ultimate choice is yours, but very few (if any) investments work out better than California real estate.  If you are worried about renting it, then I would strongly advise that you research and find a good property management company to handle things for you.

Pay attention to how much work and maintenance the property will need annually and budget accordingly. Try to find investment property that will generate a decent cash flow As well as good appreciation. It might be easier said then done, however, a property that appreciates will give you the opportunity to refinance down the road, you would then take the cash out, leaving at least 20% equity and then purchase your next property. There's more to it of course but think about how you can leverage your property/investment for growing your wealth."

RealEstate,3drpt9,madfer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:10:56 2015 UTC,"Actually yes, there are several things that you mention that are huge red flags to me. Having Family or renting to family are worst ideas ever. Unless your mom is in property management and has more than a couple of years of experience, it's a terrible idea.  Buying in an area, that you don't live in or are not familiar with is also not the best idea... You should own your own home FIRST! A mortgage that you pay on your primary home is largely tax deductible (taxes & interest) and therefore is more affordable than a rental property, which is paid with after tax money, if you have to make the payments yourself.  You would have to pay rent with after tax dollars as well, which makes living less affordable. The next red flag is the fact that you can only afford to try this with a small property. What happens when you have a small financial emergency, and the renters don't pay, or you have trouble renting it??  There is no better investment than real estate, it's almost foolproof, but not if you go into it foolishly."

RealEstate,3drboc,rkicklig,5,Sat Jul 18 18:31:43 2015 UTC,"Why do you want to change the locks after closing? Are you planning on evicting the current tenants and moving in to the property? Then you need to cancel that purchase offer NOW.  Let me make this clear: you must honor the tenant's lease. If that lease runs through December, they have every right to pay you rent and live there through December. Any lease written by somebody sane says that in the event of sale, the new owner becomes the new landlord. So yeah, you can change the locks, but you are legally obligated to give them a key. So you call the cops? The cops show up, the tenants show a copy of their lease, the cops leave (and might laugh at you). California is much more tenant friendly than a lot of places, so you can't just walk into eviction court and say ""yeah, I own the place now and I just want them out!"""

RealEstate,3drboc,Bass_Mike,2,Sun Jul 19 15:21:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about California, but if the tenant has a valid lease I would think that that has to be honored regardless of the home being sold to a new owner. Unless the tenant and owner mutually agree to terminate the lease that is. Regardless of if the tenant had a valid lease or not if they have personal property in the residence I wouldn't recommend just changing the locks. Getting legal counseling on the laws in your area is the best idea."
RealEstate,3drboc,conjunctionjunction1,2,Sat Jul 18 19:32:21 2015 UTC,You buy the tenant's lease with the property.  Legally you must honor their active lease.  Even if they don't have a lease you have to give them at least  60 days.  If you just change the locks they can 1. call the police on you and 2. sue you for wrongful eviction and win a big settlement.
RealEstate,3drboc,Tyrant_King,2,Sat Jul 18 22:24:17 2015 UTC,California has some pretty strict eviction laws. You cannot just change the locks - this will expose you to a lawsuit and daily damages.  You need an attorney to conduct a proper eviction.  Require the seller to leave $5k-10k in escrow to cover these court costs.
RealEstate,3drboc,frazzledgobemouche,3,Sun Jul 19 02:11:03 2015 UTC,"People are talking about California being a pro-tenant state, but even in the most pro-landlord states, the tenant doesn't lose all their rights with an ownership change. Their lease (regardless of whether it's formal or an informal month-to-month lease) remains in effect and all the responsibilities go to you. You will have to follow the same process as any other landlord. This probably means that you will give notice that you will be not renewing the lease (either at the end of the current lease term, or after the minimum notification period, whichever is less). The details will depend on your exact location. Alternatively, you could make them some kind of offer to move out earlier.  Honestly, you thought you could just kick them out on their asses the moment you closed on the house?"
RealEstate,3drboc,jorpjomp,2,Sun Jul 19 05:20:09 2015 UTC,"If the tenants are being a huge pain to deal with, I'd suggest walking away unless there's something wonderful about the place. A problem tenant in Cali can be a serious nightmare. Especially if there's rent control type laws in your city.  As for the inspection, the owner needs to give them a 24-hour notice. Then the selli agent shows up with the keys and let's the inspector in.  There's no such thing as ""consenting"" to an inspection. They get 24-hours notice and you get to enter the property. But that notice must come from the property owner.  When does their lease expire? If they're on MTM then you can tell the current owner to evict now. But they must not be or they'd already be kicked out.  Don't forget to get the depot out of the owner if you do close on the place."

The reality is many insurance companies won't insure an abandoned tank because there is no guarantee regarding what leakage there may have been for 20 years prior to the tank being filled with sand. You don't want that liability. A soil test around the tank won't show contamination below the tank. The reality is someone is going to have to remove that tank...either you or them at some point.   Removal of a tank could be as low as 1500 depending on size. Consult with your attorney and good luck to you."

I don't care if its filled with sand or not.  You think it's funny, but I've negotiated these exact terms numerous times for my clients.  Only once did we find contamination below the tank.  If they refuse to clean it up, you reserve the right to walk away from the deal.   If you choose to buy a house with an abandoned tank and assume the risk of soil contamination--- then you're doing it wrong."
RealEstate,3dqbq1,mrpeepers,0,Sun Jul 19 02:29:15 2015 UTC,Since this is clearly something important to you I think you should consult an attorney familiar with the laws in your state regarding oil tanks. Many people don't understand what the laws in their state actually are and how they are impacted. Lots of hearsay and reading stuff on the internet.  FWIW a decommissioned oil tank I would be happy about and just leave it alone. It's been there a long time and decommissioned over 20 years ago. Unless you demo your house and start building a children's play ground for fun and doing some intensive soil sampling you will never even know it is there.

If you can configure the locks to automatically latch, even better.  It would be expensive, definitely, but if I were going to replace all exterior locks in my house anyway, I'd consider paying extra for the keypad feature. Some are really smart and can restrict access to certain times of the day based on unique codes, etc. Talk to a locksmith."

RealEstate,3dpfaf,underwriter1,5,Sat Jul 18 15:42:08 2015 UTC,"As a contractor this gets my goat. It is not hard to secure your job site. It is not an extra step, it should be what you do after cleaning up after yourself.  If he has this ingrained in his routine, change that routine. Take his key, and put it in a lockbox, give him the code. The extra step should force him to remember to lock the site. That may be easier than going through the paperwork with your loan officer.   If he is leaving his tools on site and does this, you should fire him, as he has no respect for his own things, as well as yours. This attitude will be compounded in his craftsmanship, and you do not want that in your home. Being mindful of your surroundings, and how you leave a room is paramount, in our line of work. This lack of respect is what gives us a bad reputation."
RealEstate,3dpfaf,iamwhoiamnow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:21:13 2015 UTC,"Thank you!!! That's the thing, there are no keys... Just padlocks on all of the doors. Personally, I think that's easier than locking up with a key. So that just baffles me even more. I've already made it pretty simple. I'm thinking of just making multiple signs and putting them near all of the exits... ""Is the front door locked? Sliding doors locked? Garage door locked? Turn off the AC. Turn off all of the lights."" I shouldn't have to babysit grown men. Ugh!"
RealEstate,3dpfaf,underwriter1,3,Sat Jul 18 15:08:52 2015 UTC,"This may be the best option. Also note that padlocks are not secure, and can be removed by cordless power tools, hand tools, or even a rock on the ground. If security is your main concern, this should be addressed first. Is this a new home, with doors to be culled?  If this was me in your shoes, I would put up the notes, and whatever else is needed. When he invoices you, pay him minus your time and invoice him for that amount. Head the invoice with ""Babysitting fee"".  Before doing this examin your actions throughout the process, and identify if your actions have caused problems.   If not go for it. I try to look for faults in myself before correcting others, that is just how I avoid undue conflict. I have done this to generals I subbed from, for having to clean up after them, their employees, and subs, fix mistakes, skipped steps.  Is the AC a temp unit? In my state Hvac can't even be installed until a certain point in the project, because of the dust doing damage to the system. The nature of my work is very dusty, so I seal the system off and shut it down, while I am working, if it is present. As for heat, legally it needs to be a temporary unit, separated completely from the system (in my state).   edit; I read your responses to the other questions. Don't baby sit, don't knock off his amount. The locks are the main problem here. A deadbolt is cheap and can be culled to be reused on another job.. Getting keypad style locks is another option, just get rid of the padlocks."
RealEstate,3dpfaf,speedo356,2,Sat Jul 18 18:59:01 2015 UTC,"I actually just spoke to him about installing locks. Apparently that is something that's on his punch list, yet still has not been done. He is the one that instituted the use of the padlocks in the first place. The locks were provided by him and have the name of his company written on them. Leading me to believe that this is a normal practice for him and his crew. I don't know, I'm new to this whole process and have been nothing but polite to them."
RealEstate,3dpfaf,adventure_dog,2,Sat Jul 18 20:10:52 2015 UTC,"Locks are the first thing I do, then water (holes in roof etc.), then on to cosmetics, and fixtures. That is just how I was taught, and it has worked for 20 years. Everyone has a different method, it does not mean it is wrong necessarily. He may have a reason for the padlocks, but if he can't get his crew to use them, that is on him.  As for the AC, dust kills them. Talk to him about what he has done to protect it, what will happen to clean it, who is liable.   The first few times doing this there is a learning curve. Professionals should know better, that is what makes them professionals. Take note of these things, and make sure they are covered, next time you do this. Remember people are supposed to make mistakes, this is how we learn. It is when we don't learn that we become problematic.  Generals that have too much on their plate, tend to overlook things, or get overwhelmed and rush past important steps. This is why I don't have a general license, it's too much for me. A general should be at the base, giving the orders because they know all the parts, and how they fit, and the order it works. They are supposed to solve the problems before you have a chance to complain. Thats what you are paying for."

You can be taken to court if you don't explicitly make those issues clear, and the buyer will have a solid case against you."

I know when we did developments that were a significant neighborhood impact we had to notify everyone within a certain distance of the project and hold public discussion meetings to explain and notify the public of the project and its expected impacts. That being said, if a property received one of those notices, shouldn't that be included in disclosure paperwork concerning the property by the seller and failure to notify subsequent interested parties to the property be considered a failure to disclose all known property impacts or impediments?"
RealEstate,3doz9d,blackmoon76,2,Sat Jul 18 14:46:06 2015 UTC,Notices (if any) sent may not have been in the timeframe when the prior owner owned the property.

A piece of land, adjacent to his house, was going to be built on. The seller never disclosed it and he got $25k out of them.  Why did he have a case? Noise, crowding, and potentially obscuring his view of a park. All 3 are valid issues.  Failure to disclose is incredibly serious and lawyers will definitely give your case some scrutiny.  edit: Everyone saying you have to ""prove"" the seller knew has zero understanding of proof.  When the county uses eminent domain, every motherfucker knows. They send letters announcing hearing dates, neighbors go door to door, HOAs send out fliers.  Just because you live on the other side of the earth and are impervious to attempts to notify you is not a valid ""but I didn't know!!!1"""

People agreed with the commenter you accused of being wrong & not with your statements.    My close friend had a very similar situation. A piece of land, adjacent to his house   This is a very different situation. Adjacent to a busy road is not the same as 3 house buffer. Is a house adjacent to a lake the same as a house 3 houses away from a lake?  Sourcing your friends 1 experience is not enough data to come to the conclusion that it must be this way every single time.  Based on your limited comment history, it would appear you don't know what you are talking about.   In the process of buying myself in the CA Bay Area, I encountered lots of unpermitted work. My (very experienced) lender said it was no problem. My realtor also didn't care. The appraisers simply don't consider an extension if it's not permitted. If county records say 3br 1100sqft, then that's what the appraiser uses and gives to the bank. (This is for a conventional loan. FHA and VA loans seem are much more strict AFAIK).    No, appraisers do not simply go by public records: ""If county records say 3br 1100sqft, then that's what the appraiser uses and gives to the bank."" This is false. Public records are often inaccurate. Appraisers use their experience and judgement. They physically inspect a property & measure it themselves. If there is an addition they consider: Was the addition completed in a 'workman-like manner'? Is it heated & cooled? Does it conform with the rest of the dwelling? Does it have any functional utility issues? (do you have to walk outside or through the garage or through another bedroom to use the space?)"

RealEstate,3do872,87asu,3,Sat Jul 18 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"I think Denver has stolen a lot of SLC's thunder lately -- between the 420 factor, improving education in CO, new investment in UC Boulder, Denver is sort of following the path of Austin where it's achieving critical mass and tech companies want to invest in permanent hubs/campuses there. It's also a ""big enough"" city with a huge international airport. Finally the great outdoors. There's a lot to like.   Personally, I looked into Denver but ditched it to move back to Utah, because everything that is great about CO is better in UT -- proximity to mountains and parks, arts scene, lack of traffic. Unfortunately there's the mormon factor (more of a political issue than a religious one). 4 years ago Utah looked really hot thanks to a lot of state initiatives for tech funding (due to the efforts of John Huntsman Jr... a an unusually liberal Republican governor). However, it peaked a bit early, and the current leadership in both the governors' office and SLC mayors office can best be described as ""apathetic turds"". Not that Utah is hurting right now, but it seems tame compared to Denver."

RealEstate,3dnkhb,atl2ptown,8,Fri Jul 17 20:05:48 2015 UTC,"Paying it off now may also save some closing costs and certainly some time.  Escrow would have to order a payoff statement, and there might be some cost associated with it."

RealEstate,3dnkhb,AdrenlinHit,8,Sat Jul 18 00:25:32 2015 UTC,"I don't know your specifics, but assuming your rate reasonable, and you're in the last few years of the term (30 year mortgage?), then the way it's been structured you're not paying much in interest any more. Most mortgages are amortized, so you pay a ton of interest in the beginning and by the last few years of the term you're paying mostly principal and there's not much interest left... While I agree that paying it off before listing is a good idea because you'll pay less to the attorneys and closing fees; I would suggest paying it off only just before listing it, because otherwise you're actually just missing opportunities."
RealEstate,3dnkhb,NeedAChainsaw,2,Fri Jul 17 20:32:21 2015 UTC,Thank you! I edited in more details about the mortgage and it sounds like paying it off is my best bet.

RealEstate,3dnkhb,slidellian,3,Sat Jul 18 00:22:45 2015 UTC,"On the grand scale, mortgage debt is still pretty good debt (when compared with auto or CC debt for example).  So I'd pay everything else off first.    Real estate is an asset that allows you to carry low rate debt so you can move your chips around.  The 15k you'd put back into your mortgage is probably a very low performing investment and it's hard to get it back out."
RealEstate,3dnkhb,miraj31415,3,Sat Jul 18 03:11:16 2015 UTC,"Keeping it should not hurt or benefit the sale in any way. I would pay it off to get rid of that interest (unless you can invest it somewhere else for better return, since interest amount will be low with amortization)."
RealEstate,3dnkhb,toomuchtodotoday,3,Fri Jul 17 21:34:39 2015 UTC,"It will have to be paid off when you transfer the title, so if you have more than enough to pay off the mortgage right now, I would consider paying it off to stop having to pay whatever the interest is."
RealEstate,3dnkhb,ajfa,7,Fri Jul 17 19:30:08 2015 UTC,"Unless the interest is lower than the returns he can get with the cash. In which case, invest the cash. If he's near the end of the mortgage, there might not be much interest left to pay.  (A mortgage rate lower than investment returns is not too unlikely in the current market, so I'm saying it for future situations.)"
RealEstate,3dnkhb,ctrealestateatty,2,Fri Jul 17 20:27:49 2015 UTC,Bump. Pay it off to save on the interest.
RealEstate,3dnkhb,atl2ptown,2,Fri Jul 17 19:46:37 2015 UTC,"Well, you can do the math. If the remaining balance is $15k, that's roughly $212.50 in interest at the 4.25% rate. In practice it would be slightly less because of reverse amortization and compounding.   4.25% is a bit high, but I wouldn't stress this particular debt especially if you're going to sell your condo."

RealEstate,3dp42i,lntrullin,2,Sat Jul 18 02:35:26 2015 UTC,"Having the opportunity to inspect prior to drywall is awesome. Especially if you've got a really good inspector. They can go through and and see so much more than when the drywall is up. Even on new construction stuff gets missed. A good builder hires their own 3rd party inspector at this stage.  Watch this for example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v59MrVImhZ4  As for doing another inspection prior to closing. I think it will come down to a cost/benefit eval. If the cost isn't too burdensome, go ahead and do it. If money is tight, maybe you can get by just doing a thorough walk through yourself. You could ask around about getting a inspector to do just a verbal walkthrough, not a full report."
RealEstate,3dp42i,DCCWA,2,Sat Jul 18 16:24:58 2015 UTC,"We recommend getting three inspections: one at the pre-drywall phase, one just before closing, and one just prior to your one-year builder walkthrough. They are all important. The pre-drywall will help spot structural deficiencies and issues with in-wall systems (wiring, plumbing). The final walkthrough will check the appliances and other finished systems; it's basically identical to the inspection you would get if you are buying an existing homes. And at the one-year, that same complete inspection will help spot any issues that have cropped up that you may not recognize as being a problem. Remember, your builder will likely not volunteer information about issues unless you bring them up.  Don't rely on your local building inspector to spot issues. They have maybe ten minutes per property; they do dozens in a single day and that cursory glance can miss a LOT. A home inspector will spend several hours in the property (we generally take an hour per thousand inspectable square feet), so they're going to be looking far more carefully than the county inspector."
RealEstate,3dp42i,welmoed,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much. They can give you advice on what additions are good / bad, rather than upselling you like the builder might.  Also, if you're getting real wood floors, one piece of advice I'd have is to make sure you don't sweep / vacuum some areas (like under the TV stand, or the bed). Keep an eye out for tiny mounds of saw dust.  Sometimes builders source nice looking wood floors for an unusually cheap price... And deposit some extra nasty termites in the property."
RealEstate,3dp42i,jorpjomp,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:26:03 2015 UTC,"It's common in my market to do a pre-closing inspection. Usually it comes back clean. Occasionally they find shortcuts or little errors. The town has been inspecting it to meet minimum health and safety standards along the way and has issued a CO. I know my own town inspectors and they're all 20-30 years building experience. They're just as qualified as home inspectors, if not more so. It's still a good idea to get one just as insurance before you make a big investment."
RealEstate,3dp42i,underwriter1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:41:19 2015 UTC,"Does your city not require inspections? Where I live there are 3 inspections. First inspection is frame/plumbing rough-in/electrical rough-in. Second is insulation. Third is move-in inspection. Basically new-built homes are up to code. There was an issue recently where a city inspector passed a house because he knew the insulator and builder well and assumed that everything was done right. The insulator forgot to insulate the garage ceiling. It caused a bunch of problems, when they found out what the problem was the city inspector lost his job and the builder got sued and had to pay out a lot. There would pretty much be no point in getting an inspector since the builder/city inspectors know what they are doing and are liable. Recently my mom wanted to add a patio to our house, the contractor was cheaping out so hard, less than one inch of gravel, no mesh in the concrete, and some other things. My mom knows better but if you were getting work done yourself like this, and you don't know about construction, then you might want to get an inspector."
RealEstate,3dp42i,RUS_Hustler,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:32:27 2015 UTC,For me it would be a waste of money both times.  Do a few walk throughs yourself and ask questions.  But whatever makes you feel warm and fuzzy is your choice.

RealEstate,3dp42i,AMoreExcitingName,2,Sat Jul 18 04:05:05 2015 UTC,"I'd do it. It can't hurt, and might find something. Even if it doesn't, it'll give you piece of mind and compared to the overall expense of the house, really isn't significant.  Also take pictures, lots of them. It'll give you a way to document the house if problems do develop, either within or after the builders warranty.  Pictures are basically free these days, there is no reason not to take hundreds of them. I ended up having a problem in my basement, the original home owners left me a pile of 3x5 prints they took 20 years ago, which helped tremendously in fixing the issue."

RealEstate,3dp42i,squishykins,2,Sat Jul 18 13:37:17 2015 UTC,"I would definitely get the pre-drywall inspection for your peace of mind and skip the pre-closing inspection. There are likely town/county inspectors coming through at several stages in order to make sure the home meets code, and one of them will definitely visit before issuing a certificate of occupancy. You should also be given the opportunity to walk the house yourself shortly before closing, which is where you'll visually identify any finish issues that need to be addressed. Test EVERYTHING!

You might be able to talk your parents into buying a place for you, but as the parent of a college student myself I think that's a longshot. It also doesn't meet the goal of you having an asset.  Thing two: remember that the $10k a year for room and board does not have to be paid at once, represents a place that you don't have to worry about maintenance on, don't have to pay any utility bills on, doesn't have any HOA fees, includes a bed and a desk, is ridiculously close to your classes, and not only gives you a ""free lunch,"" but also includes breakfast and dinner. Oh yeah, and you're allowed to borrow money (or use other financial aid/scholarships) to pay it despite the fact that you have no income. In short, I think you've radically underestimated the costs of ownership.  This brings me to thing three: unless you have a chunk of cash for a downpayment and high enough income to pay a monthly mortgage, you are not getting a mortgage. Let's say for the sake of argument that you've got a chunk of cash big enough to buy a place outright, and the world's coolest parents who are willing to sign off on you buying a place instead of letting that money sit in savings until graduation. You've never bought a home and you don't know the area perfectly well, so you do risk buying a place that is not what it seems to be (or isn't in the most desirable neighborhood). You've still got a cheap place in a college town that you will have to rent out or sell in 4 years when you leave that college. There is no promise that the place will have risen in value. If it's a condo, there's no promise that HOA rules will allow you to rent it.   TLDR: Tips? Be at least 18 and have a full time job."

RealEstate,3dogm4,Realestateuniverse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:40:51 2015 UTC,If you know the area chances are you know it better than 95% of the realtors.
RealEstate,3dogm4,Realestateuniverse,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:59:27 2015 UTC,I think it depends on what your goals are. What will your taxes each month be? Also how much are you counting for repairs and other expenses?
RealEstate,3dogm4,ajfa,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:15:07 2015 UTC,Taxes are included in the expenses. I used 10% for vacancy. My goals are to live for free while I am in the place and then when I move out I want to cash flow 200 per a door.
RealEstate,3dogm4,GringoGrande,2,Sat Jul 18 04:20:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know the numbers in your area for taxes but if you can limit your expenses I believe you would live for very close to free. You will probably end having to pay utilities still but not bad.  After you move out, you will most likely be cash flowing close to the additional rent you are earning (550 if you were living in unit 1). Let's say you have some more vacancy and repairs to make but you should cash flow about $300-400"
RealEstate,3dogm4,muppetmannn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:50:28 2015 UTC,"By the numbers this looks like a great deal. It meets both 1% and PITI+50% rules.   That said:   what condition if the property in? will it need major repairs in the foreseeable future? what is the neighborhood around it doing? Is this in a rural area with an economy that might contract? Long-term vacancy is not fun.   If you're confident in the fundamentals, put in the offer and get as low an accepted offer as possible. Then find a thorough inspector, and try to ding them on concessions depending on what you find."

RealEstate,3dnx3i,conjunctionjunction1,2,Fri Jul 17 21:04:08 2015 UTC,"My agent asked if they would agree to an exception, but they said no—but then added that they don't weigh the dogs. What's curious is that everyone with a dog must register it with the HOA. The form includes the dog's weight—and the HOA/management company must sign it. I would think that the signature would constitute tacit approval, but I'm not sure that I want to have to mess with it."
RealEstate,3dnx3i,smthsmth,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:10:36 2015 UTC,"I'd think if your dog was closer to the weight limit and you could fudge it, it wouldn't be so bad... maybe starve him down before weigh in ;)   But yeah, with the dog being blatantly over the weight limit, I'd pass on this place.  All it would take is for one neighbor to be jealous and want their own big dog and narc you out.  This happens, it happened in one of my properties.

RealEstate,3dnx3i,jmoney6,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:50:37 2015 UTC,I think it would be worth following up: why are they not willing to make an exception for a rule they don't enforce? if you can get in a room with the HOA rep. it could be interesting. I'd love to hear their reasoning for it.

RealEstate,3dko45,tleb,5,Fri Jul 17 06:14:41 2015 UTC,I think the condo association is in on it. I'm renting/leasing the unit from the condo association president who owns my particular unit. I talked to her about it and she made it seem like she was aware of the plan.

RealEstate,3dko45,piratepuppy1,20,Fri Jul 17 05:38:11 2015 UTC,"The  answer is maybe, maybe not. If assessments are delinquent, which is probable, the association may have their own foreclosed lien and court order of possession, even while the bank foreclosure is pending. This allows the association to legally rent out the unit to recover unpaid assessments. Depending on your state, the bank who will eventually become the owner of the unit may take ownership subject to the terms of the legal lease.  If these are just owners doing this on their own, then no."
RealEstate,3dko45,California_Viking,2,Fri Jul 17 11:35:05 2015 UTC,While the association might have a lien/loan on it they still need to Actually own it to rent it out.  Who owns the condo now? The bank? The former owner? The HOA. Laws are different. A real estate agent in your area familiar with HOA might know.
RealEstate,3dko45,cowsandmilk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:07:48 2015 UTC,"+1000 to this.  It seems you are unclear if they are acting as part of the condo association. If so, this is 100% legal in many states, especially those where an HOA lien can have priority over a mortgage."
RealEstate,3dko45,madfer,2,Fri Jul 17 14:42:29 2015 UTC,They would have to catch up on the first to take legal possession of the property. HOA liens DO NOT have priority over mortgages. They would still not own the property even if they (the HOA) foreclosed on their lien.  THIS WOULD STILL BE ILLEGAL AS FUCK!
RealEstate,3dko45,cowsandmilk,5,Fri Jul 17 16:02:16 2015 UTC,"You may know the law in your state, but I know the law in my state. In MA, HOAs can have super liens that have priority over the first mortgage. Yes, they are limited in the number of months of dues they represent. But they are absolutely given priority over mortgages. The only thing they don't have priority over is municipal liens. They also cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.  HOAs in Mass can even collect such liens against tenants. That is, if you are renting out your property, they can tell your tenants to pay their rent to the HOA to pay off the HOA lien against your property. Thus, they don't even have to take possession of your property to get paid.  Stop pretending that you know the law on this when the OP hasn't even stated where the condo is located."
RealEstate,3dko45,madfer,2,Fri Jul 17 18:38:52 2015 UTC,"HOA's never have to take possession of the property to get paid, but you must be able to have legal possession of the property in order to give possession. Here it seems clear the bank OWNS the property, not the neighbors or the HOA? or do they?  Anyways renting to a tenant a property you don't own and/or have legal possession or right to is usually called fraud, and people do and should go to jail for that.   With all this said, I didn't know anything about super liens (so thank you for that education) that take priority over a first mortgage. I can't think of any reason why a bank would make a loan on a property that can be wiped out by an HOA, lien."
RealEstate,3dko45,piratepuppy1,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:14:05 2015 UTC,I'm in Illinois. I looked up HOA liens and their priority but I can't find anything definitive on whether the mortgage Lein or HOA Lein take priority or whether the HOA can collect through leasing the property.
RealEstate,3dko45,madfer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:21:39 2015 UTC,"The association can have a lien. See 765 ILCS605/9. It is not a super lien as described by cowsandmilk, but it can be foreclosed and the court can order that, and usually does order the remedy of allowing the HOA to rent the property to recoup losses.  In fact any board that doesn't do this better have their E/O paid up because it is probably a breach of their fiduciary duty."
RealEstate,3dko45,piratepuppy1,2,Sat Jul 18 11:08:53 2015 UTC,that sounds like a lot of paperwork . I hope that they will take the proper steps BEFORE they lease the apartment to a new tennant. I do feel better about the situation now that i know this happens often. thank you u/piratepuppy1 and r/realestate for the info.
RealEstate,3dko45,Eyalush,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:25:25 2015 UTC,"A quick title search can show who the owner is….if the association actually owns the property without telling the owners about it I would be surprised. If the bank foreclosed on the property and is the current owner, then the association must get permission in order to have legal possession to rent it out, otherwise this is just another scam on an unsuspecting tenant.  Just because a association has a lien, doesn't make them the owner, although they can foreclose on the property. Foreclosing on the property doesn't automatically make them the owners with legal possession of the property. They are normally subject to any rights a first lien holder has….  Is it the association doing this or just some neighbors?"
RealEstate,3dko45,MissPredicament,3,Sun Jul 19 07:36:12 2015 UTC,"They don't have to be the owner to have the legal right to rent it out.

RealEstate,3dko45,LennyLongshoes,2,Fri Jul 17 16:27:07 2015 UTC,I am certain the HOA has something to do with it. I will do my best to look up the laws in my state before I do anything else. I told my landlord/HOA-president that as long as the prospective tenant is aware of the situation I will stay out of it. There is a no trespassing sign on the door with a case # and i took a picture of it JIC anymore trouble comes out of this.
RealEstate,3dko45,cshivers,12,Fri Jul 17 16:44:41 2015 UTC,Your HOA will be very interested in hearing about this. They should help shut it down.

She could get a construction loan and build a house.  She could get a manufactured home and have it placed on the property.  If the lot is in a commercial area she can put a warehouse/office building.

I don't like doing them because of the hours upon hours that is spent with paperwork, the bank, follow up etc.  The few I did, I ended up making less than minimum wage per hour invested.    I agree with having an attorney involved in the transaction because of all of the legalities that can be involved in short sales, but the way that I have typically seen it done is a line item on the proposed HUD on the seller's side that is either approved or denied by the seller's mortgage company, and a flat fee ($2500 is what I have seen locally), not a % of the sale price."
RealEstate,3dng18,DooberGuy,2,Fri Jul 17 21:01:07 2015 UTC,This is very common. Most real estate agents are terrible at short sales so they get 3rd parties like this guy to do it for them. The bank pays for it normally. The only drawback is the bank might reject your offer if that 6% pushes them over their price target.
RealEstate,3dng18,NeedAChainsaw,2,Fri Jul 17 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"6% is high, I used to have a guy who did it for 1% and I actually split it with the buyer even though I was the seller's agent, because the negotiator helps ME out quite a bit and I felt that was fair."

RealEstate,3dn5f3,bjam2,2,Fri Jul 17 20:52:03 2015 UTC,I've experienced 2 types of rental agents.    The Boston/NY/SF type that show you 2 apartments and get pissed off if you don't immediately try to rent both of them. (Paid 1-1.5 months rent by landlord) The Houston/Rent.com type that will spam you a list of every complex in town and let you do everything else. (Paid $100 or so by apartment complex).   If it is something in between maybe it's worth it and they deserve your loyalty but both of these types can screw off if they think they deserve exclusivity.

My lease is up in October and I would like to purchase a home by then.   If you're financing a start-up, and you can't buy the home with cash, you don't need to be buying a home. You ESPECIALLY don't need to be buying a home in Austin right now. There's a 30% chance that you'd get murdered by the housing bubble of the Palo Alto of the Southwest. When the business matures and you stop shoveling money into it, then talk to a lender.  That's like saying to the lender ""I can make an X down payment but the rest of my money comes from junk bonds so we'll just have to see whether or not I default."""
RealEstate,3dmkno,utopianfiat,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:21:57 2015 UTC,"Excellent advice, I had considered this, truth be told It weighs on my mind when I am looking at houses. My concern is that If I do not purchase now in Austin, I will be stuck renting for a protracted period of time.    As for the finances I already deposited the initial operating capital in a separate account in exchange for my total equity ownership. So while I can always inject more money into the company I am confident in my ability to keep the funds separate, thus have the liquidity to purchase a home.   My alternative if is leave the bulk of that money in a brokerage and deduct my sustenance level income from it until my start-up is funded. Though that sets of alarms in my head of paying exorbitant rent into a hole, even if it is split four ways."
RealEstate,3dmkno,utopianfiat,3,Fri Jul 17 15:38:08 2015 UTC,"I'm still not convinced this is a super great time to buy in the city. You're there, so you know how far out prices are going. It's not just the risk of default that you have to keep in mind, but the risk that the bubble will pop and your home will be underwater.  With that in mind, Round Rock and outer Bastrop have always been kinda safe if you're into dealing with ATX traffic.  Alternatively, fuck the lender and buy cash. It's something I've done before and it's a great way to shave a few grand off the final price as well as getting full equity right away.

RealEstate,3dmkno,MsTerious1,3,Fri Jul 17 19:24:55 2015 UTC,"TL;DR, no one wants to take my money for a roof and walls, doors optional.   Correction: no one wants to give you THEIR money."
RealEstate,3dmkno,MsTerious1,2,Fri Jul 17 17:32:13 2015 UTC,"Well, it'll be tough to get a typical mortgage loan, but that doesn't mean you have no options at all, either.   Any lender will be looking for your ability to repay and cash reserves, along with DTI (debt-to-income ratio.) The DTI is a problem for many self-employed people, especially if their tax returns have maximized their deductions to make their income look low.   You'll need 6 months' worth of reserves for payments no matter what, which you seem to have. So the cash flow is really your problem. For $700 in monthly debts, a lender would like to see income of more than $1500 per month, but your roommates' statements will be meaningless. If one of them has reasonable credit, they could co-sign a loan with you so you could use their income, but if you do this you may wish to consult an attorney about a side contract that specifies who owns what percentage of the property. This can be problematic.   Also, your business experience probably won't matter much. I might have a lot of experience as a window washer, but if I take a new window washing job that pays me 80% less than I used to get, they'll still use my new income.   Your best opportunity to get financing will be from a bank that is local to you and does what are called ""portfolio loans."" A portfolio loan is one that does not get sold on the secondary market, so the bank where you got it will keep the loan. You'll make your payments to them for as long as you have the loan open. I would encourage you to contact an experienced real estate agent who can guide you to local lenders who have these programs.  Your second best chance would be with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage if you can find someone who knows their products inside and out. I hate dealing with WF but I have three loans (two of which are new) because my mortgage originator for WF knows how to get things approved that are normally turned down for my own unusual circumstances."
RealEstate,3dmkno,madfer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:32:14 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input! It's is good to know that there are options. I have been in contact with a real estate agent who has been very helpful in prepping me for my expectations on what I can afford. However every broker he's referred me too has laughed me out of the office or flat out said ""no.""  I'll meander over to the Wells Fargo building here in Austin around noon when I take lunch and see what they say.   I am surprised that having the room-mates to agree to pay rent is meaningless. But it is good to know. I had assumed that I could show that I had three individuals who are currently renting with me would continue to do so giving me an additional $1200 to $1950 a month as income. Should I not mention it all or mention it if the ask if I have other income?"
RealEstate,3dmkno,madfer,3,Fri Jul 17 14:39:15 2015 UTC,"The reason it's meaningless is that a) friends lie for each other, especially when b) the bank can only hold note signers accountable.  Even if you had some sort of contract that they paid you just for being your handsome self, you'd have to show at least a year's worth of payment proofs before it would be accepted.   If you don't get good answers from your local WF person, may I encourage you to call Ina Fernandez or find her through the WF site? She has been a mortgage broker since before I was a real estate, so around 15 years, I guess, and she knows details about the company's programs that many WF agents don't know about or know how to use because she attends every training they have and networks with all the right decision makers within the company. I am not sure if I can post phone contact info on here, so I can edit this if it isn't allowed, but 573-336-1277 is her number. She's based in MO but she will be able to assist you or point you to someone who can."

As long as you have been self employed for at least 3 years in the same industry with a decent taxable income, then you should have no problem getting a mortgage. Any Lender who laughs at you, doesn't have the experience to help you anyways.  Do not mention you will be renting rooms to any lender. It makes it sound like you know that you can't afford a place on your own. Also the lender won't allow this ""rental income"" anyways.  I wish I did loans in Texas…."

RealEstate,3dmkno,ajfa,2,Fri Jul 17 16:53:40 2015 UTC,"If you are not in the same industry, then yes you would not likely qualify to buy at this time. Lenders look at your income over 2-3 years in the same industry. You will need 3 years of income (if self-employed) in your new business to get a ""normal"" loan on a property.  Nothing renders your business experience and performance null. It's just that only proven income over time in the same industry is the only aspect of that experience that matters to lenders."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,icarus_flies,8,Fri Jul 17 04:23:26 2015 UTC,"Agents are wary of giving anyone, buyers or sellers, a hard number on how much offer or list for. We're trained in self preservation, and it's a gamble because a client can come back and say it's our fault they didn't get house or our fault the identical house down the street sold for $20K more.  That being said, a savvy agent will say something like: ""Based on the numbers, it's my opinion the house will sell for X, what would you like to offer.""   As for researching comparable sales, I recommend finding the most similar home in the most similar location, even if you have to go back a year or two to find the sale and then adjust for market growth. My second piece of advice is to remember, especially in competitive markets, that the house that closed on 7/1/15 is actually indicative of the market price for that home on 6/1/15, the day the offer was accepted assuming a standard 30 day close. In a hot market that could mean .5%-1.5% difference in market value.  Lastly, just thrown in, if you're a competitive market, forget about finding a ""deal"", just let it go. Purchasing a property at market value is a win."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,Konfidence,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:06:56 2015 UTC,"I am less interested in finding a deal and more interested in getting in as close to the appraisal price as possible.   With an FHA loan, we qualify for significantly higher than asking (almost 100k more) but that means nothing if the house doesn't appraise close to our offer. So knowing what the house will roughly appraise for (within 5-10k or so?) is tantamount to making an offer we can stand behind and that will hopefully win the house."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,themeatbridge,6,Fri Jul 17 05:22:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, appraisals are tough to predict. You can do all of your due diligence and still be off by 205% or more. Don't worry about hitting that target, and just offer what you are comfortable paying for that house. Your offer should be contingent on obtaining financing, which means if the appraisal comes back low, you renegotiate. Even cash offers ought to be contingent on an appraisal.   Edited - brain stupid sometimes and numbers hard."

You are correct. I confused myself by starting with $20k on a $300-$400k home, but then thought about how it will scale as the price goes up or down, switched it to a percent and then just forgot to do the math. It should really be within 5% up or down, but there is always room for interpretation."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,themeatbridge,6,Fri Jul 17 16:18:45 2015 UTC,"Are you guys dealing with multiple offers on most homes? Are you getting to be a player in the multiple counter offer phase? Sometimes it's worth it to offer high, get accepted, and duke it out with the sellers over the appraisal later. Your first step is getting into contract. I agree it's not the ideal way to buy a house, and take it with the caveat that I don't work in your market, know your price range, or any of the peripheral details, but circumstances and leverage are going to dictate the way your transaction plays out. Trying to accurately predict the appraisal in a volatile market going to set you up for disappointment. It's like trying to predict what a honey badger with Tourette's syndrome might do."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,madfer,5,Fri Jul 17 06:03:33 2015 UTC,"If you're going FHA then you will lose with an offer that is competing against any cash offer or conventional that is bringing more money to the closing table than you can. So having an offer denied isn't because you aren't offering the right price. You could offer higher than someone who is bringing cash but the seller is looking at their net, and perhaps ease of transaction.   FHA requires an appraisal for mortgage approval so technically even if your realtor is bad at comps, it won't matter much. Here's what will happen. You find a house you want for 200k. Since it's a hot market you offer 215k, with the FHA addendum contingency that requires the property to appraise for 215k. The licensed professional appraiser comes in and says it's worth 205k. Your contract says you can take your escrow back and exit the contract. Or you can give the sellers 205k or renegotiate the contract and give the sellers the difference in cash."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,madfer,2,Fri Jul 17 06:13:11 2015 UTC,"My agent has been adamant about ""being able to back up our offer"", ie: having the cash to cover the difference if the house appraises for lower than our offer. We already lost out on one house due to a cash offer.    I am going to get away from this strategy and follow closer to your advice."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,madfer,4,Fri Jul 17 06:45:25 2015 UTC,"Oh hell no. Why would you pay more than the appraisal value? If it appraises low, there's a reason for it. Any cash you bring to the table is flushed down the drain the minute you get the keys."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,jorpjomp,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:56:48 2015 UTC,"If the market you are in is ""ultra competitive"" then come in at asking every time, unless there is a bidding war with multiple offers.  Since you are going FHA, you will be at a disadvantage on paper against any other coming in with more money. It sounds like you agent is doing an ok job, despite her lack of experience with comps.   Let the appraiser worry about values, and just find a decent deal to pay full price on. Whether the house comes in at for value or not is something you don't have any control over anyways."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,karnac,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"The market we are in routinely goes for over asking, 10-20k so the question is how much to overbid to win the house, without going over the appraisal. Not a fun game to play..."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,landofmisfits,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:41:26 2015 UTC,"Yep, I've been down that road many times before. It's not fun, but worth it. If there are lots of offers on a place, then you will likely just get outbid.   You need to be able to get in with the first offers, and if there are multiples a seller will then likely ask for overbids. Unless of course someone just makes them a crazy offer. Nothing you can do about those.   You need to know that you are likely in the weakest position compared to non first time buyers, so there are other things you guys need to do to compensate for the win."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,puhleeez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:07:04 2015 UTC,"I realize that we are in a weaker position which is why my agent wanted to qualify every offer with a statement of ""my buyers can back up any difference if the house appraises low.""  We should be the first people into this house that listed yesterday and if we choose to put an offer in I want to put a 24hr contingency on it to make sure we are competing with less people. Hopefully this works or at least they counter offer so we can negotiate."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,dogwood876,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:27:29 2015 UTC,"I would NOT put language like that into a contract. If you get a shitty appraiser then you will be screwed on the deal. If you actually have money to back up ANY DIFFERENCE, then I would strongly consider doing a conventional loan instead. FHA is great if you don't have the money, but if you do, then conventional is better.  All offers in a hot market should always come with a 24-36 time limit. If the seller doesn't/won't respond, then your agent should demand to present the offer in person directly to the seller. This should be done every time whenever possible anyways.  The seller however can set a minimum time they want to have the property on the market in order to get the most offers."
RealEstate,3dl8bb,puhleeez,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:38:13 2015 UTC,"Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of your offer, as you know, price isn't the only aspect.   Yes, absolutely, your agent should know the market price within a couple points. If they do, you won't have an appraisal problem (unless you have to ""overpay"" due to competition)  I don't always share the market analysis data (unless the client demands it), as that wastes time, but your agent should confidently share pricing opinions which you'd like to see substantiated with actual closed sales data.  Demand better! Tell your friend that things are too close, and ask her to refer you to a top agent. She'll still get a referral fee and you won't have your friendship tainted by this experience. I can already tell, if/when you get into a house, you'll always wonder if she advised you appropriately... this is no bueno for friendships.

RealEstate,3dk6vu,Realestateuniverse,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:15:13 2015 UTC,Another strategy is to change the 'best-use' of the property. Usually this works better in smaller towns or cities.   Land can be lucrative but it can also be slow. You might be able to find land that has back taxes on it or has been inherited or just completely given up on. Typically land is owned outright so the best thing to do is find somebody who just wants to cash out and you can pick it up for cheap. Make sure you know the supply and demand of the market though.
RealEstate,3dk6vu,cowsandmilk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:35:20 2015 UTC,"You often need to do research. There are likely differences between the $25k lots and the $4k lots. The difference may just be zoning. It may be something that makes it unbuildable.  Most unbuildable lots only have value to the neighbors. Even then, they're perfectly happy not buying as the lot will remain empty regardless of whether they buy it."

One thing to remember is that vacant land has no income, only expenses - taxes, liability insurance, etc. If you can find something with existing utilities, ie, water & sewer taps in, at the right price you can probably do pretty well over a couple year time period. In a pinch, you may be able to put a trailer on it to cover expenses."

That is a niche thing, and you might be able to make money on it, but its not going to be an easy ""omg why did no one else think of this thing"".  If you buy land for 4k and put a  20k trailer on it now you have a 24k unit that is going to depreciate instead of appreciate like normal RE does.  Maybe that can work, maybe not, but make sure you fully understand the economics of it."
RealEstate,3dl8ap,MDT1221,5,Fri Jul 17 04:23:14 2015 UTC,"It's a hard question to answer because it's a personal question.  Some people are okay with rolling the dice a bit, some people like a very settled feeling.    I'm a agent and it's hard to advise people in these situations.  The best you can usually do is lay out the pros and cons.     The pro is obvious, you found the house you want. The con is also obvious, the potential for a can of worms.    The only other thing I can do is advise what I would do personally if I was buying. I would get an outside major company to come in and give a quote.  Then make a business decision as to if the price is still right even after I know what the repair will cost.   Also in this case I would make said repair a priority.  A backed up sewer pipe or leaking sewage are not things I would live with for any period of time.  I mean who wants an assortment of turds possibly building up under their driveway?     Good luck in what ever you choose."
RealEstate,3dl8ap,Riglin4096,3,Fri Jul 17 05:01:00 2015 UTC,"Let's work backwards. If you buy the house, you definitely want to address the issue. Get several opinions and quotes from at least three contractors. Repair the issue now before it gets worse, and it will get worse.   So, you want to know how much that will cost. Get those quotes now, and factor that into your decision to buy. Can you afford the repairs? Or are you spending all of your cash on the down payment and closing costs? Sometimes, even if the purchase price comes down, you still won't have the money to put into the project.   If the seller is unwilling to fix it, the cost should come off the price of the home. Let's say for example that the quotes all come in around $10k. You will want either a seller's assist and/or a price reduction totaling that much. If the seller is unwilling or unable to give that much back, you need to ask yourself if the home is worth $10k more than your previous offer."

If the cost had gone up any higher, I wouldn't have been able to sell and close on my new house.  See how much it costs for the repair, and try to work with the seller.  Good luck!

RealEstate,3dl8ap,Jamie3beers,3,Fri Jul 17 13:05:11 2015 UTC,"I would go for clearing out the existing roots and then just being diligent about treating the sewer line regularly with root killer. If the line is otherwise in good shape that should most likely take care of any issues.   ABS line suggests it is relatively newer so should have a substantial lifespan still. Worst case scenario you can just plan for replacement down the road.  I wouldn't worry too much about a ""sinkhole"". That requires a fairly high volume of water. Not what you're likely to see from some minor sewer line leakage. And driveway settling can probably be treated separately from sewer line issues."

RealEstate,3dk5g7,0ddmanrush,5,Thu Jul 16 22:40:33 2015 UTC,"Your mortgage documents will often say 12 months. There are exceptions, especially if you actually occupied it initially (you can document with moving receipts), but it needs to be documented why you did not occupy for the full 12 months. For example, if you move in and then a week later have a home invasion and your wife refuses to stay in the home, that's both document-able and understandable. Another example, you take a job in another state within the 12 months and can no longer occupy. Also document-able and understandable. Or even if before you move in, you get fired and have to take a job in a new state- also document-able and understandable.  Now that won't necessarily always stop a lender from calling the note due or requiring you to refinance into an investment property. But in terms of criminal occupancy fraud- that's more geared towards investors who were deceitful and had no intention in the first place to occupy and have 10 ""owner-occupied"" investment properties. These cases usually involve a more involved type of fraud where realtors and loan officers are aware and apart of the fraud."

I know you can definitely find good helocs with introductory interest rates pretty easily. The bank I deal with currently has a HEA that's at 1.75% for the first 6 months then variable at prime minus 0.5% afterwards which is currently 3.25%.

Our electric bill dwarfed even our gas bill just heating those bathrooms - it was awful.  So I completely understand the hate for resistive electric heat in these comments, and would never consider buying a house with one.  In very cold weather, heat pumps degrade to the efficiency of a resistive heater (they in fact use a supplemental restive heater) so if your winters have a lot of very cold days I'd avoid heat pumps too.

Our postmaster did not even require that we talk to them about it, though you should check locally. Get separate street addresses. Is your lot zoned for multiple houses?

Building codes are unnecessarily complex It's simply a gimmick to increase taxes  If you go and look at all the permits, what will it really tell you?  If there are no permits, what does that mean?

It tells you that the work was done to code, which is usually for the safety of the inhabitants of the house. It tells you that after you buy the house, you won't have to worry about the taxes changing due to a reassessment that noticed work not already accounted for in the original assessment that increases the value of the house (you wouldn't want to buy a house thinking the taxes will be 5k a year and have them jump to 8k because of all the renovations).  And buying inspectors off doesn't seem like it would make any financial sense, it would be cheaper to just do it right. Permits cost maybe $500 for a larger project, I can't imagine someone would be willing to get paid off for much less than that. There wouldn't be a need to buy off inspectors because the work wouldn't necessarily be noticed anyhow.  Whether or not it is common for work to be unpermitted, that doesn't change all of the risks that go along with it. You don't want to be on the other end of that stick when laws change 10 years later to be much more strict about building codes, and you find yourself now responsible for it if you want a certificate of occupancy when you sell."

My town fines heavily when you don't get permits, and even if it isn't a problem when I buy it, a future buyer when I try to sell it could report it to the town and make it difficult for me to sell."
RealEstate,3diyhv,TuckerGrover,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:35:49 2015 UTC,How does one check permits?
RealEstate,3diyhv,IQuestionEveryOne,2,Sun Jul 19 01:42:42 2015 UTC,"Check with your towns inspection office. It varies greatly by location. I happen to be in a smaller town of about 50k people, so they have at town hall a building inspectors office where anyone can go in and request a house card that shows all the permits pulled and violations and variance requests made since the beginning of the record keeping system in the 60s. Some places will be more complex and require proof that you need the information. I can also go online and get the tax assessment records for every house in the state I live in, to see a floorplan of the house and notice if they added a bathroom or a room that isn't on the tax records."
RealEstate,3diyhv,TuckerGrover,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I am able to check some basic information to include tax assessment, but nothing that shows a floor plan. An old zillow listing from 11 years ago says 3bed 2bath, but they are selling it as 4 and 2.5."
RealEstate,3diyhv,thedave25,2,Sun Jul 19 02:48:28 2015 UTC,"Every home inspector I've had dealings with was overly thorough.  I am in Florida, which I assume is not true in your case as you mentioned oil tank.  I'm not sure how home inspectors are in the rest of the country, but if you've already plaid the inspector and have received a detailed report, I would say your pretty safe with the exception of the other specialties you mentioned.  I will say I have never seen a home inspector do anything with driveways, sidewalks or landscaping."

RealEstate,3diyhv,NumNumLobster,2,Thu Jul 16 18:37:21 2015 UTC,"Are in-ground oil tanks common and typical for the market in NJ?  Because wow, in the Greater Boston market, it is a real challenge to acquire financing with an underground oil tank.  At a very minimum you are going to want to get that tested and I should think optimally request the seller remove it and replace it with an above ground tank."
RealEstate,3diyhv,letrinka,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:51:29 2015 UTC,"They aren't very typical anymore, as most people found the added insurance premium as an incentive to take it out of the ground.  We have already acquired a reference for tank testing but I'm not sure the seller will agree to replacement.  I'm not sure I want to take it that far either as I have some good connections for fuel conversion (natural gas is available in the house) and tank excavation.  Then again, I might have some leverage since the owner doesn't know how old the tank is.  We happened to run into the neighbor as we left the house.  They were literally in the middle of an underground tank excavation because their's had sprung a leak.  That might also work in our favor."
RealEstate,3diyhv,goosetavo2013,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:02:57 2015 UTC,how close is their tank to your property?  Are you sure it hasn't contaminated any of your soil?
RealEstate,3diyhv,DCCWA,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:33:04 2015 UTC,It's on the property about 6 feet from the house.  We're not sure of contamination as it still needs to get inspected.
RealEstate,3diyhv,32454325,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:51:09 2015 UTC,"I was more concerned about pre-sale than post-sale, as in your ability to acquire a mortgage for property with an underground oil storage tank.    I think I'd want to be proactive and contact my lender of choice to see what their standards and underwriting guidelines say about such tanks so you'd know what you need to inspect during your due diligence period and not days before closing.  I think your leverage would be that unless the seller can reasonably expect a cash offer or can offer seller-financing, whatever they need to do for your lender they'll likely need to do for anyone else's lender too."
RealEstate,3dimem,IsabelleHappy,10,Thu Jul 16 15:57:15 2015 UTC,"Stick with $762 and tell them that's best you'll do, so they can take it or they can lose $12k and go with the $750k offer.  Or if you want to be vindictive, pull back to $751k or $755k and tell them you reconsidered. You'll likely lose the house this way, but you should always be willing to walk away."
RealEstate,3dimem,DigitalEvil,2,Thu Jul 16 16:07:49 2015 UTC,I'd call their bluff with 755 and tell them to respond by 5pm the next day and I'd turn my counter in at 4:59.

RealEstate,3dimem,DigitalEvil,2,Fri Jul 17 13:56:49 2015 UTC,"If it's that important to his wife, then he shouldn't even be questioning paying whatever the seller wants ($775k). The $762k should be final offer, ie: no budging. No sense even asking the question if he is going to cave anyways from fear of losing the home.  Rule #1 in any negotiation: ALWAYS BE WILLING TO WALK AWAY.  I believe I included that in my previous comment too, which explains the logic behind why I said he should stick to $762k."
RealEstate,3dimem,Lollipopolis,2,Thu Jul 16 18:48:04 2015 UTC,I agree. Hold firm at $762 and let them stew with that for a couple of days. The party that cares the least in the negotiations wins.
RealEstate,3dimem,PhredPhnerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:10:07 2015 UTC,GRRRRR> It is SO frustrating because our first offer was based on the non-existent comps and we went back to play ball with a VERY fair and good offer. I think we will hold at $762 and see what happens.   We also think they are bluffing on the 'other offer' that suddenly came in last night. I think it's unlikely but I realize this is a game.
RealEstate,3dimem,Causative,6,Thu Jul 16 16:12:34 2015 UTC,"I'm that agent.  I can't tell you how many times I've sneaked in and grabbed properties while negotiations were taking place with other parties.  I relied on the buyer thinking it was a seller tactic and not making a move against me.  I've also been the victim of this.  In my experience, 49 out of 50 times it usually turns out to true."
RealEstate,3dimem,PhredPhnerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:43:02 2015 UTC,"I am sure it's a sold tactic--however, it's just bizarre that on Monday they came down to 775 when they weren't negotiating at all....and then the next day we meet them halfway and their response is 'we have another offer' that was LESS than our last offer!  Fishy, no?"
RealEstate,3dimem,harrywhite1,6,Thu Jul 16 18:49:28 2015 UTC,Basically they are implying 'we told the other guy you already offered 762 and they might outbid you so you better go higher' more likely is 'anothet buyer offered 750 and we would have turned it down but are going to keep them on the ropes in the hope of a bidding war but we don't have a matching offer yet else you would already know.'

RealEstate,3dimem,Doza13,2,Thu Jul 16 16:06:14 2015 UTC,Are you getting financing?  Because you won't get the appraisal you need if overpriced.
RealEstate,3dimem,kegman83,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:13:14 2015 UTC,Yes...getting financing. Another house one block away (corner lot) slightly smaller house-- sold for $850k last month but it's a teardown and they will put up a $2million house. You can't do that on the property we are interested in. So who knows what the bank will say. Another house sold for $742 a few houses down and that was a teardown as well---there's a huge house on it now--the lot was better than what I want.
RealEstate,3dimem,lawandhodorsvu,3,Thu Jul 16 16:16:18 2015 UTC,You just said it is priced $150k over comps....doesn't really sound like it.
RealEstate,3dimem,IQuestionEveryOne,2,Thu Jul 16 19:40:18 2015 UTC,"I always look at it this way.. Buying a 750k home is not an investment. Therefore, you are purchasing it based on your emotions. If you really LOVE the home and you will be happy with it for at least the next 5, 10, or even 30 years, then is it really worth losing it over $50 a month when you are already paying $3,000+ a month in financing?  Yeah, you might have to give in and give the sellers what they want, but you are getting a home that you absolutely love for 1-2% more each month."
RealEstate,3dimem,lawandhodorsvu,2,Thu Jul 16 17:38:33 2015 UTC,I would stand firm at $762 and give them 24 hours to decide and then be ready to walk away.
RealEstate,3dkzlo,jackster1232002,2,Fri Jul 17 03:01:28 2015 UTC,"its fine to post here but it comes down to whats in the contract.  Based on what you are saying it sounds like your agent did a shit job of handling that side of things.  After your inspection period is up you lose that contingency, so whatever you did as an addendum to deal with this is what matters.  ""no water in basement"" sounds like a shit addendum to me.  You should have indicated the work described in that quote would be done, and subject to inspection etc.    Sorry I can't really answer this without more information.  I'd say go with what your agent says but from reading that they already fucked up.  For $1k you are looking at representing yourself in small claims probably, as a lawyer is going to eat that fast.    Offering to settle for $500 may be a good strategy.    Do you still want the house?  What does a proper fix to this cost?  A french drain system is probably like 3-15k depending on length.    Can you post the actual addendum regarding this?  If the work in the quote wasn't done, what, if any, repairs is the seller claiming were performed?"
RealEstate,3dkzlo,NumNumLobster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:09:14 2015 UTC,"I agree the addendum to the contract was not clear. We sent the inspection over to the selling agent and highlighted what needed to be addressed. There was termite damage and rot wood underneath the home. Both of which has been addressed. When the selling agent returned the modified addendum to us, she simply rehighlighted what they were willing to do. The final repair list we both agreed upon listed addressing this verbatium:  ""Evidence of moisture invasion in the crawl space (standing water)"".   This was highlighted in the inspection summary (I agree with all should have listed it exactly what is was and how it was going to be addressed).   The selling agent (after both parties signed the addendum with repairs) sent over a quote from the crawl space contactor that included the termite, rot wood replacement, and french drain installation. 2 out of the 3 has been completed. The third has not.   Now granted the termite and rot wood replacement was not clearly definied in the repaid addendum either:  ""Wood rot damage located in the front sill""  ""Excessive amount of termite tubs located at the left back of the home""  ""Termite damage located at left rear and and left sill and sub floor""  There's a lot more related to termite damage and rot wood and all have been addressed through methods indicated by the crawl space contractor except for the french drain installation.   As far as wanting the home, no at this point I'm sick and tired of it and to be honest don't really want it anymore. They've pushed the closing date by 2 weeks and wasn't completed this morning (I swung by the house and contractors were still working on it).   I am ready to move on to greener pastures."
RealEstate,3dkzlo,dogwood876,2,Fri Jul 17 03:20:11 2015 UTC,"If you are ready to move on, you might just have to eat the $1k and chalk it up to an expensive lesson learned. Also, depending on what state you are in and how the contract is worded, it might not be as simple as giving up $1k and moving on. If you are technically in default by not moving forward with the purchase (I get that this is what is being debated - did the sellers do what was required in the addendum or not?), then they could choose to sue you for damages..."
RealEstate,3dkzlo,NumNumLobster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:01:33 2015 UTC,What state has this policy?
RealEstate,3dkzlo,minze,2,Fri Jul 17 14:12:39 2015 UTC,"its not a state policy, it depends how your contract is worded.  If it says the damages for not closing are $1k, then those are the damages.  If it says $1k will be held to be applied to closing or any damages that may occur, then that is just saying it is like a $1k bond.  They can sue you for more than this.  This is why it is really really important if you do settle this for whatever amount, they sign a disclaimer that neither party is holding any other liable for any additional damages.  If whatever your agent gives you to sign doesn't say anything similar to that, do not sign it."
RealEstate,3dkzlo,NumNumLobster,2,Fri Jul 17 14:33:25 2015 UTC,"IANAL but it is really going to come down to 1 thing.  You said to address ""Evidence of moisture invasion in the crawl space (standing water)""  They are coming back and saying ""there is no stanidng water in the basement"".  the 1 thing it is going to come down to:  Is their addressing the of the item accurate?  Basically, is there standing water in the basement.  From what I gather the answer is no (sure - because it hasn't rained but we're getting to cause/effect here).    I agree with /u/NumNumLobster that your agent did a shit job.  ""addressing the issues"" of standing water in the basement could really be done by mopping it up so it's not there anymore.  BAM, it's addressed.  The ""how"" it is to be addressed is the important part here and that's where the f-up happened because it was left up in the air."
RealEstate,3dkzlo,icantrange,2,Fri Jul 17 13:48:24 2015 UTC,"yeah when I read that my first thought was ""well if they go down there with a wet vac they addressed the issue....."".  Not saying that is correct, or a judge would agree with that, but it is significantly murky, which is pretty much the opposite of what you'd like in your contracts...."
RealEstate,3dkzlo,GoGreenGiant,2,Fri Jul 17 14:45:45 2015 UTC,"This is the main reason you should go over all contracts you sign off on and not just sign them. The only thing to help is to close on the house, find a local place that can evaluate the basement to determine what would be needed. This suggestion is only if otherwise you really want the house."
RealEstate,3dkzlo,XPostLinker,2,Fri Jul 17 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with you here. I actually had my own crawl space contractor go and inspect the house during my inspection period and even he suggested installing a french drain because there was evidence of standing water.   In the post above I stated that french drain install was not in the repair addendum to the contract. We sent the inspection summary to the selling agent indicating what needed to be fixed and she simply highlighted what they were willing to do. Among the issues included addressing:  ""Evidence of moisture invasion in the crawl space (standing water)"".  When it came time to repairs the sellers contractor did not see any standing water and the sellers decided not to install the french drain system without notifying us. Now keep in mind the selling agent sent us a copy of an invoice from their contractor stating all jobs that were going to be done of which included the french drain system."

RealEstate,3diqja,DCCWA,2,Thu Jul 16 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"I don't think that solves my issue though. If I give the seller money for the redemption right, I'm out of pocket to just have the opportunity to negotiate with the lender. If the lender tells me they won't budge on the $123k, I'll lose money buying the rights."
RealEstate,3diqja,landofmisfits,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:03:21 2015 UTC,"Redemption period is only a set number of days, here it is 30, so it is very unlikely that even if a lender would lend on the house with the necessary repairs that you would be able to push a loan to happen that fast, especially since it seems that the sheriff's sale already occurred and there has been enough time in between to send a letter to the seller.  If you really want the house, wait til redemption expires, then make an offer directly to the lender.  If it is a small local bank, you have a chance of them listening to you, if it's one of the big guys, you likely won't get anywhere and will have to wait until the house comes on the market as a foreclosure."

When I was working in the apartment industry (Texas, if it matters), the invoice from the carpet company would include footage and final cost. Labor was not itemized. Life expectancy was not noted. Reason for replacement? Because the manager called and said to replace it! So even if you got that invoice somehow, you would not have the information you want.

Whomever has the money right now (i.e. you if it's a new charge, him if it's a deposit you want back) has the upper hand in this situation."
RealEstate,3dgdys,kaeroku,3,Thu Jul 16 12:30:53 2015 UTC,"Basically, the answer is yes what was provided to you is detailed enough for an itemized list.  They will have to demonstrate in court why it required replacement, and if you were smart and took photos of the condition of the place when you moved out, there's no way they can uphold it even if they can show the carpet is damaged now (unless there was an issue with how and when you turned over the keys; if it happened while the place was still technically yours, they may be able to uphold it. But that's marginal at best.)  Itemized lists only require that a simple cause and amount are listed, like a receipt. If you dispute it, it goes to court, at which point a few things might happen. If you were provided an itemized list, then there will be a hearing where you will get to present whatever evidence you have of the condition of the place when you left it, and they will present whatever evidence they have of the cost and need for carpets to be replaced.   If you hadn't been provided a list, there may not be a hearing because the landlord did not do what was required of them to withhold the rent, (again, this makes some assumptions, such as you providing a forwarding address within 30 days of moving out, etc.)  In the event there is no hearing, and the landlord does not return your deposit, you must go to the court which is responsible for where you used to live (should be able to find online) and sue in small claims. If you win (by demonstrating the carpets were not damaged, and there was no other reason for the LL to justifiably withhold your SD) the LL will be required to pay your SD back as well as your court fees.  ... if they don't pay you'd have to register the judgment with the courthouse to have the amount forcibly deducted, if the LL has any assets (presumably they do.)  There will be variations to the duration and method of that process depending on your location. Some states allow some things and disallow other things which may not be included here. I'm not a lawyer, just a LL who has worked in several states.  Good luck."

RealEstate,3dgdys,pencilears_mom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:38:57 2015 UTC,"In order to take a deposit a WA landlord must provide a walk-through checklist detailing the condition of the property at the time you move in so it can be compared with the condition when you move out. RCW 59.18.260. You are responsible for damage, you are not responsible for normal wear and tear. If you walked over the carpet, it is going to get matted down. If your dog wasn't housebroken, it is going to be obvious from the condition of the carpet. What would be really handy is to find out how many previous occupants lived in your apartment, and if the carpet was actually new when you moved in. ""Brand new at move-in"" means it is now two years old. But do they have documentation showing that? Or, did they go after the previous tenant to replace the carpet two years ago because of damage done during that tenancy?   I swear some landlords have a secret book they pass around sharing secrets of How To Maximize Money from Tenants by refusing to return their deposits, and demanding a Great Deal More in damages. Look at RCW 59 18 280.   What your landlord failed to detail is what the heck happened to this carpet. ""New two years ago"" tells us nothing about the condition now. Don't bother disputing this, just take them to small claims. Seattle District Court judges have seen this before."
RealEstate,3dgdys,rulesbite,2,Thu Jul 16 03:32:54 2015 UTC,"Property manager here. Yea that's pretty much all I'd share with a tenant if I was billing them for carpet replacement. Be honest with yourself was the carpet showing signs of unreasonable wear and tear? Did you make an effort to have the carpets cleaned? Did you clean said carpets? Did dog, cat, boyfriend, girlfriend piss or spill wine everywhere? Perhaps salsa? Would you have moved in in the unit given the condition of the carpet upon move out?"

RealEstate,3didop,wolfcoin,5,Thu Jul 16 14:52:08 2015 UTC,"While I'm definitely more a lurker than I poster, here's my short sale experience with my $0.02 on your situation at the end.  The house I bought in a short sale was also vacant for a couple years, winterized with the utilities off. I wasn't too concerned and was willing to roll the dice on taking the house as is without inspections (other than my own, with the utilities off). I'm an architect and handy so I wasn't too concerned and like you, I really wanted the house.  Unfortunately, the owner's mortgage holder (Bank) had other ideas. They required the utilities on for their appraisal to happen. The owner had outstanding balances owed to electric and gas companies so neither were willing to turn them on without someone on the hook for the new charges.  Bank said too bad. Get them on or the deal's dead. I, as a buyer without any legal claim to the property had to use my good standing with the electric and gas companies to turn the utilities on IN MY NAME. I was very concerned with turning them back off should the deal fall through. I was assured by both there would be no problem so I reluctantly went through with it.  Bank got their appraisal done and I got to do a more thorough inspection with the utilities on. Water was active on the city side, just off inside the house. I had to reinstall the water meter myself and open some valves to get it going.  So now came time to turn the utilities back off and get them out of my name until when and if the deal went through and I own it. Electric was no problem. Gas said, you don't own the property and are not a tenant so I can't help you, the owner has to be the one to discontinue service. I explained I was previously told otherwise and had no direct contact with the owner and only had gas service started for appraisals and inspections as a potential buyer. They didn't care. I said thanks and I'll try to get in touch with the owner through the listing agent. Called back immediately and this new rep had no problem turning the service off for me! This is the same gas company that repeatedly stuck me with the $xxxx bill from the previous owner of my first home. After being assured it was taken care of several times, I found out 2 year later it was sent to collections (without any notification) when I applied for a car loan. #%$&!  Months later the bank came back with a take it or leave it counter offer. It happened to be my max number so we took it.  Not directly the same as your situation, it's a fun story to tell.  Now my $0.02 for your situation:  1) Just because the owner accepted your offer, being a short sale, the Mortgage holder has to also accept the offer (and loss). If your $290k offer is substantially less than what is owed, they may not. You might get a take it or leave it counter offer like I did or they may just say no and you're done (without putting in a higher offer).  2) The bank's attorney may attempt to get the contract reduce the $2000 for you to cover the plumbing repair, but again, the bank's short sale department has final say on the offer and amount of loss they are willing to absorb.  3) Emotions should not come into play when buying a house (yeah, right /*sarcasm). Since you say you are willing to do just about anything have you considered waving the water system inspection and proceeding without it? You already know there is an issue that will cost some money to repair. I'd hate to pay for this repair then ultimately have the deal fall through. Or get a plumber out there for an estimate for the repair. ""Two pipes"" shouldn't cost more than a couple hundred to fix. This will tell you worst case how much extra you'll be out should you pay for the fix the deal fall through. While the plumber's offer him $50 to do an informal once over on the plumbing system as it is currently and consider his opinion as your inspection.   4) There's another ""perfect"" house out there without a broken plumbing system."
RealEstate,3didop,ewb4arch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:17:49 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Sorry to hear about the collections hit - that is something that always scares me, theres practically nothing you can do in that situation, its just bad luck. There is still a lot of digging and work i have to do and will likely encounter similar situation when it comes to utilities and taxes and all that, and who knows what will show up on the title search!  after thinking more about it and going over it with people and these responses, im at the stage where i think im going to attempt to make the repair just to get the nearest one bathroom working, and keep the rest of the house off. I dont think this will cost more than a few hundred dollars for a few hours of my plumbers time.. i just need to get consent from the seller to go in and make the repair - if i can accomplish that it will make things a whole lot easier ill be able to send in the home inspector and septic inspetion and that will get me where i need to be to make a final offer to the bank."
RealEstate,3didop,DCCWA,3,Sun Jul 19 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"The bank has a large financial interest in the property. The property has been abandoned by the seller. The bank periodically inspects the property, when they discover it abandoned the property management company secures and winterizes the property to protect the banks interest. This is very normal.  The seller has walked away from the property, they're checked out. The bank is the one who cares, it is their money on the line. So yes, the seller/owner is an involved party, but the party you're really dealing with is the bank. Again, very normal.  As for inspection. You can either do inspections without dewinterizing (using generator for power and compressor to pressure test lines) or you can try to patch it together  now out of pocket and hope for the best. I would suggest just going ahead and doing your inspections. Anything else is going to create a more complicated transaction and the goal with short sales is to keep them simple and try to get the deal approved."
RealEstate,3didop,NumNumLobster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:15:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the advice! Wondering now mainly about the bank and securing my mortgage, how in depth their appraisal process will be.. I spoke to my mortgage broker and have a good feeling they will want to see at least one bathroom functional for me to close.. so I am thinking, being that there is a bathroom near the main water line in, if i can get consent from the bank i can go in and run one line from the main right to that bathroom real quick and than both me and my bank will be able to do a full inspection, it is the septic that i think all parties are mainly concerned about testing. I think it will only cost me a few hundred dollars to accomplish that and i think im willing to roll the dice and lose that in the event it ends up not working out."
RealEstate,3didop,mrsmetalbeard,3,Sun Jul 19 20:32:31 2015 UTC,"watch the scope of repairs if you do that.  If it is a couple known busted pipes that is one thing.  That guy could have leaks all over you will wind up chasing.  Not to mention, something busted those pipes theoretically so having leaks all over seems probable.    Where did they come up with $2k?  That really doesn't sound like a lot to me"
RealEstate,3didop,Doge_Funnie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:16:15 2015 UTC,"yeah, the 2k is random number she threw at me.. but my latest plan is to get consent to go in for repairs and just get one bathroom functional and keep the rest of the house shut off, which i think i can accomplish it for a few hundred bucks. There is a good chance there are more broken pipes around the rest of the house but i am not too concerned with that because once i close on it i can go in and do all of the repairs properly and it shouldnt be a huge expense."
RealEstate,3di0i6,Shiftygreen,12,Thu Jul 16 12:57:29 2015 UTC,"It's simply shitty, bad luck that another offer came in and the sellers chose it over yours before they signed.   The deadline that I'm assuming your agent put on the new offer doesn't obligate the sellers to sign it. It makes your offer expire in hopes that it speeds up their decision. There's no penalty for letting it expire without telling you within that time frame.   Sorry you're so frustrated! It's always really disappointing when you think you have the house only to find out you don't."
RealEstate,3di0i6,earthpeesfire,2,Thu Jul 16 13:28:05 2015 UTC,"It was also really shitty the way the seller did this. They shopped the op's offer to get a better deal for themselves. It's not illegal, but i consider this dishonest."
RealEstate,3di0i6,madfer,2,Fri Jul 17 17:01:51 2015 UTC,"shrugs It's definitely not nice, but the listing agent got them top dollar which was in the best interest of his/her clients. There are a few agents in my market that consistently do this and I don't consider them dishonest as much as fiercly committed to getting their clients the best deal possible (which sucks for me as a buyer's agent, but it is what it is)."
RealEstate,3di0i6,earthpeesfire,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:40:28 2015 UTC,"I understand, this is why I would not have agreed to ""rewrite"" the contract. I would have just sent back the signed counter.

RealEstate,3di0i6,madfer,8,Fri Jul 17 18:28:42 2015 UTC,"These things happen. Sorry it happened to you. ""I had to wait 3 hours"" is not even worth getting upset about, let along complaining to brokers.   Good luck on the next offer."
RealEstate,3di0i6,ShortWoman,7,Thu Jul 16 13:49:08 2015 UTC,When your agent called and said they were considering another bid .... that was your queue to drop the back and forth on the closing costs.     It doesn't sound like anything unethical happened here and it would be a waste of time to complain to anyone.
RealEstate,3di0i6,German_Mafia,5,Thu Jul 16 13:58:14 2015 UTC,"Whose deadline was crossed?  Your updated offer's?  If that's the case, your offer was dead at the time it expired.    I don't really see anything unethical here.  Let me see if I've got this right:  You offered.  They countered with a verbal request for a new offer with different terms.  You withdrew the original offer and instructed your agent to put in the new offer with the terms requested by the selling agent, and presumably some kind of expiration.   Your agent received word that they were accepting your offer...and so did your agent send the seller-signed contract to you?  Or send your signed offer to the seller?   I don't understand where the ""four hours"" and the ""three hours past the deadline"" come into play here.    This sounds like pretty ordinary dealing.  EDIT:  I guess my question is this, if this isn't ethical, how do you feel your interests were compromised by your agent?  In what way did he not represent your interest?"
RealEstate,3di0i6,andpassword,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:12:45 2015 UTC,"My agent sent our new contract to the seller agent. What I thought was unethical, was verbally accepting the offer, asking us to rewrite the contract to their terms, then after many hours of what we thought was a closed deal, changing their mind.   The contract had an expiration time written into it, the seller agent texted our agent at the expiration time and told us they were still deciding. It was more of a nussence to keep us waiting the additional time."
RealEstate,3di0i6,sharkizzle,6,Thu Jul 16 13:39:09 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, a verbal acceptance is not a real acceptance - it must be in writing always.  It happens a lot in hot markets.  Stay positive - you might be surprised to find something better pop up around the corner!  :)"
RealEstate,3di0i6,andpassword,6,Thu Jul 16 13:52:04 2015 UTC,"If the seller's agent texted at the expiration time and asked for a couple more hours, that's the seller's agent doing his job.  Remember that on the other side of the table there are people just like you, selling a house instead of buying one.  Just like you want to find the best house that will advance your family's needs, they want to find the best offer which will be most advantageous to them.  Sounds like in this case your interests didn't align.  That's all right...it happens.  Stay positive, you'll find the place where your interests coincide with the seller's.    Additionally, in the future, you can instruct your agent to decline extending your offer deadline, and then you know that if your offer isn't accepted by the deadline, it's finished."

RealEstate,3di0i6,Pappy091,3,Thu Jul 16 14:02:56 2015 UTC,"Something similar happened to me once.  I would call it not nice, rather than unethical.  I then offered a bit more, which they then accepted.  Then I decided I just didn't like it all and didn't go through with it.  I still regret not going through with it, but each case is different and maybe you'll be happy this didn't work out."
RealEstate,3di0i6,Realestateuniverse,2,Thu Jul 16 13:34:25 2015 UTC,"Don't see anything even remotely unethical here. Even if the seller was in some way being unethical, whose broker would you call and why? The seller's agent? Because the seller decided to take another offer? What should the agent(s) have done differently in your opinion?  Put yourself in the seller's shoes. If you have a higher offer come in before you've signed the contract would leave thousands of dollars on the table just to be nice? I doubt it."

RealEstate,3dg44r,landofmisfits,3,Thu Jul 16 00:46:07 2015 UTC,"We recently moved a block and a half to stay in the same loved neighborhood after looking at lots of neighborhoods (mostly via open houses) for three years.

No reason not to stay where you love except, if you ever think you will need a school district to be good, please take that into account. Good luck!"
RealEstate,3dg44r,samiv2,3,Thu Jul 16 01:45:57 2015 UTC,"This really isn't a question someone else can answer for you. It's sort of like asking if vanilla or chocolate is better (ok, chocolate obviously).   It comes down to what your personal preferences are.   Me personally, i don't mind a short commute if i means i can get a nicer house. My SO on the other hand would rather live in a smaller house if i means we're right on top of 'the action' and can just walk to restaurants etc.  So you basically have to weigh the pros and cons of each situation and decide which is best for you. How important is it to be within walking distance versus an X minute car/bus commute? Are the houses that you can afford that are in the neighborhood you want to be in the type of house you would be comfortable living in?   I live in the San Fran area and, without traffic, it's about a 20-25 minute ride to the middle of SF. For me that's an ok distance. We get a bigger house with a little more privacy compared to what we'd get for a house actually in SF.  So I would make a list of the pluses and minuses of each situation and decide which one has more pluses for you. One thing to keep in mind is potential resale value. So if as you said the area is coming up, even if the further away house right now would be better for you, in the long run you might be better off getting the house in the up and coming area since you might be able to turn around and sell it for a profit a few years down the road.  One last thing to consider...location, location, location :) You can make some changes to the house once you buy it, but you can't change the location. So if there something about a house you really don't like, consider if it's something you can reasonably change at some point."

It was worth the wait. I love being able to walk to stuff and my house is cute and historic (well... about as historic as a house can get in my area- my city is relatively new). Good luck on your search- if your circumstances allow for it, don't be afraid to be picky! It's a big purchase so you should be happy with it."
RealEstate,3dg44r,arghyematey,3,Thu Jul 16 03:58:39 2015 UTC,"You will be miserable moving to a random unfamiliar place because you think you got a deal, and chances are that you didn't get a deal at all and you're just unfamiliar with prices in that area.  You -should- be looking at a handful of neighborhoods, but this presumes that you're not just one of those people who is stuck in a 10 block radius completely oblivious to everything around you.  You need to be familiar with the city and have a basic idea of what is going on in each neighborhood.  Only then does it make perfect sense to target and monitor a handful of neighborhoods.    The housing market tends to slow down after Summer so you might see even fewer houses come up.  On the plus side, prices tend to be a little better.  Do not get discouraged.  Focus on things that you can do right now to make things smoother and easier later.  Have everything ready.  When the time comes, when the deal comes, be ready to jump.  If you don't jump, there are plenty of investors who will.  I've lost several houses even though I made the offer on Day 1 it showed up on MLS. (DC is probably more competitive than your market.. but the point stands.  It only takes 1 person to be quicker than you.)"
RealEstate,3dg44r,witoldc,3,Thu Jul 16 05:07:35 2015 UTC,"I did the same thing you're doing. I was only interested in two neighborhoods near Downtown. I think it's important to be happy with the location. Just be prepared to offer asking price or above asking price for a house if there is a lot of competition in the area. Don't hesitate. As soon as a house goes on the market, go see it and if you like it make an offer ASAP."
RealEstate,3dg44r,mllejolie,3,Thu Jul 16 10:03:34 2015 UTC,"Had a very similar situation when I bought my current house. I knew the exact neighborhood I wanted, everything is walkable, top rated schools, lots of events, etc. It took awhile but we eventually found the right place, the issue is that there is normally a lot of competition in places like that, so prepared to jump on a property quickly when you find it."

I'm like you, I love living in a historic downtown neighborhood and can't imagine moving out to the suburbs. Secondly, just because there are only 6 houses available right now, doesn't mean you should buy one of those 6. Don't let an arbitrary deadline force your hand (lease ending soon, etc). There will be more houses next month, and the month after that. It can be very fun and exciting looking at all these places and at the end of the day you just NEED one. But you really don't.

Slow offices tend to get cut throat.  Commission split - this is last because if the above items aren't in place, you aren't going to have commissions to split."
RealEstate,3dfkj3,sarcasticorange,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:27:31 2015 UTC,"This can't be answered simply because there are so many variables (local market, experience in sales, experience in real estate, etc.).  However, here's some general guidelines;  If you're new to sales and/or real estate,  look at companies that focus on training.  Your split will be worse, but you get the training and support even if you don't sell anything.  If you're seasoned in sales and/or real estate, look at companies with better splits.  They'll probably still have resources available for training, but usually nowhere near the level as the other type of brokerage.  You'll also have more out of pocket expenses.  Whatever route you choose, remember this:  Agents are a commodity.  The free training will get you going.  Developing your own style and niche beyond the basic principles will increase your chances of long term success.  Good luck!"

And some of those units are even 1br 1 bath..  I found a duplex listed for $115,000 in Philadelphia. The duplex i found is a two story so probably at least a 2br 1bath... I would put the rent at $700/mth depending on your market and condition of home and neighborhood. That give you $1400 a month. Now lets subtract bills. Say you got a 15y conventional loan at 3.625APR for $92000 and put down 20% (23,000) Your monthly payment would be $663. Then you would need to calculate for repairs, insurance, landscaping?, rainy day fund.. It is very possible.. and in 15Y you would have 115,000 capital with a 1400/mth cash flow..."

RealEstate,3dg5ur,FHAProblems,9,Thu Jul 16 00:34:31 2015 UTC,"All lenders have an appeal process for appraisals now.   Your agent (maybe the other agent too) need to find the comps that you believe are more correct. Did the appraiser include the one two doors down or completely miss it? If they missed it, that's very good for your case. Include any others you believe are most similar. Leave out the $/SF argument, that's not an appraisal technique. You want to list the most recent, and closest in size and utility (if yours is 2-story use mostly 2-story comps etc). Just give them a list. Date of sale, square footage, condition (equal, superior, inferior) if you know it. Include the MLS sheets. Make sure these are closed sales that are settled, ideally you want to verify them in the tax records and not rely on MLS (your agent should know how to do this).   There is no reason to go back 12 months when a market is active. I hate to say report any appraiser but ones that are as incompetent or lazy as you indicate (taking you at your word) need to be removed from the business. Every state has a board that regulates appraisers and filing a complaint is simple, you send a copy of the report in with the reason you feel the appraiser erred. Some states allow anonymous complaints.   FHA does not use fly-by-night places so I have to disagree with your agent. FHA Underwriters are well trained and licensed and known as DEU (direct endorsement underwriters) and have a lot of power. I've never met one who was dumb or rude so, I wonder if that is who your agent spoke to, but I suppose anyone can have a bad day. But really your lender is the one who should be filing the appeal with the FHA.   There are also several FHA homeowner centers scattered around the country, google this with your state and call the closest one. The people who answer the phones there are usually pretty great and they have a lot of info at their disposal.   I can think of two things that can easily explain that bad of an appraisal. One, the appraiser cloned an old report they did a while back in that neighborhood and didn't make any updates. Two, they have an unlicensed trainee who did it, illegally BTW, and they just sign off on things without looking at it. Unfortunately this activity is not heavily enforced and when everyone is undercutting each other on fees and lenders prefer the cheap appraisers sometimes you get an unethical one.   Try not to stress too much, if the comps are really there as you seem to think I bet you can get this fixed. Not by the 17th, obviously, but, hopefully soon. Good luck. And please let us know how this works out for you, we love to read updates here. Well I do, anyway."
RealEstate,3dg5ur,wamazing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:17:27 2015 UTC,"Great post, thanks a ton. I'll do my best to keep this as updated as I can manage.  I was really surprised to hear the comps were going back that far, I'm in the DFW area and the homes are flying off the shelves as fast as you can list. For example we were on the market for 6 days (fri-wed) and had 40 showings and 5 offers. No reason to go back that far. I'll be getting a copy of the appraisal tomorrow from my realtor.  As far as my agent and the FHA underwriter, all Im getting is the agent's side and while she has been nothing but good for me so far, if the things she said are true they are very concerning. She claims the underwriter told her that ""They love this appraiser and he has never ever made a mistake yadda yadda"" Could just be a slapfest between the two who knows.  My agent reached out to me this evening and both my agent and the buyer's agent have compiled their own comps and both filed an appeal and we should have a decision by tomorrow (thats pretty fast at least).  She went over some possible scenarios we could encounter and advised on each:   No change in appraisal, sell at 150k. She advised against this heavily but said we could if we wanted to. No change in appraisal, relist on the market and obviously exclude FHA loans. Appraisal changes somewhere between halfway and what I'm asking for. Right now we are selling at 173k less 3k in buyer's closing costs (we initially listed on MLS at 164k and got two offers over 170) We drew a tentative line in the sand of netting myself the original 164 and if we can get the appraisal there we'll probably take it, else back to the market or option #4. Finding a pro ass risk-taking lender to take someone who has only qualified for an FHA loan so far and squeezing them into a conventional somehow. It'd buy us a new appraisal and new shot at these buyers. I'm a bit iffy on this because it seems borderline taking advantage of the buyers, but they REALLY want my place so if they're cool with it (it was their idea) I guess I'm cool with it if they can swing it.   The not stressing out part is hard, we're already moved in 500 miles away and are counting on the house selling quickly (4-6 weeks was my initial budget) so its still possible. But at the end of the day I know its so much worse for the buyers. We were their 10th offer they put in, first to actually be accepted and they had to waive the inspection, warranty, and option period to get bumped up to the offer we accepted (they offered it initially we didn't ask for any of that). Its got to absolutely suck to think you finally have your house only to have it ripped away 48 hours from closing."

RealEstate,3dg5ur,aardy,3,Mon Jul 20 13:02:10 2015 UTC,"She also said the lender FHA is using is some small time fly-by-night time place and she is concerned there is some collusion between them and this appraiser.   FHA is not lending your buyer money. FHA is not the lender. Your buyer's lender is the lender. FHA merely insures it.  /u/wamazing's post is on point. If the comps are really there, your buyer's lender can (internally to his institution) challenge the appraisal. Enlist the help of both realtors.    A house 2 doors down went on the market four days before me. Our houses are nearly identical in condition, with mine having just a few more upgrades, fresher paint and a few small things like that.   Closed deals trump listings. I imagine you do not want to wait the 45 days from today (at least) it will take for that deal to close, so I wouldn't hang my hat on that."

RealEstate,3dg5ur,landofmisfits,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:15:39 2015 UTC,"If it goes back on the market, tell your realtor conventional or cash only.  Then you don't run into these nightmare scenarios.  That FHA appraisal is going to stick for 6 months.  Typically when an appraisal comes in low the buyer should meet you half way, if you're willing to sell at that price.  Since it's FHA, I doubt buyer has much cash.  I'd walk."

RealEstate,3dg3tq,Decoyboat,5,Thu Jul 16 00:18:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, FHA has basic guidelines for conditions that all properties must meet.  The house has to be habitable, all fixtures and mechanics have to be functional and it can't have any health or safety issues."
RealEstate,3dg3tq,landofmisfits,3,Thu Jul 16 00:48:03 2015 UTC,Can the issues be addressed?  Or does FHA just say no and walk away if existing conditions do not meet their standards?
RealEstate,3dg3tq,Think_please,2,Thu Jul 16 00:56:26 2015 UTC,"I had this exact situation when I bought my house (~5 years ago), when the appraisal came in well above the sale price, but there were painting/patching ceiling issues in a few areas that needed to be taken care of. Since the owner was an elderly woman who was already in assisted living I went in and spent part of a day sanding, painting, and patching, and the other commenter is correct that the appraiser had to come back a few days later to make sure that the repairs were finished (though I don't remember any additional charges for the return visit)."
RealEstate,3dg3tq,ShortWoman,3,Thu Jul 16 04:00:20 2015 UTC,"Sure, if you can get the seller to make repairs before closing. I can't honestly say I know whether you'd have to pay for a second appraisal to verify that repairs were made at that point. This is going to be a hard sell if the roof is the issue.   You can also talk to your mortgage guy about either rehab loans or escrow holdbacks (you put aside money in a special account earmarked for repairs after closing). These both have conditions and strings attached and usually take some time to implement, if you can make them work at all."
RealEstate,3dg3tq,landofmisfits,4,Thu Jul 16 01:10:24 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it is a second appraisal, since it is an appraisal subject to conditions being corrected.

RealEstate,3dffpg,carseatquinoa,7,Wed Jul 15 21:12:07 2015 UTC,"Ask your Realtor and your mortgage guy lots and lots of questions. It is their job to answer them for you. Also, be sure you check out the FAQ, because there's lots of good information for first time buyers.  So, I do need to correct a misunderstanding you have. There is not a VA inspector that will check every little thing after you put an offer in on a house. What does happen is this:   You put in an offer and (perhaps after some negotiations) it gets accepted. Just because you make an offer doesn't mean the seller will accept it. You should get a home inspector that works for you (costs a few hundred bucks) and will tell you what he sees that is wrong. You can often but not always negotiate some repairs or a price reduction based on what he finds. Assuming that goes well, your lender will send an appraiser to determine a) what the property is worth and b) whether or not the property meets VA standards. Lots can go wrong at this step, and it's all in the name of ""protecting"" you. I can see how this can be misconstrued as an inspector looking out for your interests.   Some veterans mistakenly think that the zero down VA loan means no out of pocket expenses when you purchase a home. Nothing could be less true. There are still plenty of things you'll spend money on before or at closing, and there will still be things that need to be repaired or replaced after closing.  Depending on your local market, you might have difficulty getting a VA offer accepted. This is because the appraisal standards are high and there are a number of fees you are not allowed to pay (so the seller usually ends up paying them).  Good luck on your purchase, and thank you for your (or your husband's) service."

RealEstate,3dffpg,ShortWoman,2,Thu Jul 16 01:04:55 2015 UTC,"This is misleading.   Closing costs can not be 'rolled into the mortgage'. If you buy a home for 100k and have 3k in cc, you can not just take a loan for 103k. What you can likely do is negotiate the interest rate to give you a credit instead of paying points, effectively mitigating some closing costs.   With a VA loan the only thing that can be truly rolled into the mtg is the VA funding fee which iirc is 2.15% first time use and 3.33% each time after. If course of you receive any VA disability it is waived."
RealEstate,3dffpg,SofaKing_Dope,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:17:08 2015 UTC,Rolling closing costs into a mortgage is not a VA-specific thing but a general mortgage thing.

My reply was to simply state that your statement claiming that closing costs can 'typically be rolled in'  was misleading. The article you linked has a section labeled misconceptions and in this section it does a fair job explaining that it's not as simple as checking a box but really depends on lenders LTV guidelines. The OP is talking about utilizing a VA loan to take advantage of a loan that allows 100% LTV. I know for a fact that the top two VA home loan lenders do not allow in excess of 100% LTV on a purchase.   As far as sources, I can't link as I'm on mobile but feel free to look it up.  VA Pamphlet 26-7 > chapter 3 VA loan and guaranty > section 1 Basic Elements of a VA-Guaranteed Loan> a General Rules > under closing costs states ""closing costs cannot be financed in the loan except on certain refinancing loans.""  Again, I'm not disagreeing that there may be some select circumstances in which closing costs could be rolled in, this circumstance is not one and furthermore, I stand behind my assertion that your statement was misleading."
RealEstate,3dffpg,SofaKing_Dope,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:21:55 2015 UTC,"No hostility intended.  To summarize, I'm suggesting that in such an example of 100k loan and 3k in closing costs, the buyer would most likely be able to get a 103k loan.  There might be multiple ways of getting it done or describing it but the end result is similar.  I've seen it and I've done it.  Up to the buyer to try it out if needed.  LTV is not over 100% if the V is 103k if agreed to by the bank."

RealEstate,3dffpg,240strong,2,Thu Jul 16 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"I am actually using the VA loan right now and my inspection period just ended yesterday. I am looking at a house right around 115k. Granted it's ""no down payment"". Like everyone had already said, be prepared to shell out over $1000 in earnest payment, whole house inspection, radon inspection (termite inspection usually falls on seller through VA LOAN), and appraisal. The earnest money you will get back if everything is hunky dorey and you purchase the home. Sometimes you can roll the appraisal in on your seller. In your inspection period, you may have to pay contractors to give you estimates on potential repairs. Big hurdles with the VA Loan is a slightly longer turn around time on the loan itself. The appraiser MAY say something about very aged roofs, CHIPPING PAINT and some other things the VA deems major faults that they demand fixed before allowing you to purchase the home.   This is the cliffnotes of what I could think of right now in no typical order. Any questions feel free to ask! Good luck!"

Needless to say, we had to push our closing back a week, and come up with 7,000 (5,000 more on top of the 2,000 we've already paid in to everything) because the sellers didn't want to do the assist anymore since they were willing to bring the price down.

RealEstate,3dfelf,Th3_Child,2,Wed Jul 15 21:04:17 2015 UTC,"Make sure you understand your state laws with regards to tenants' rights. I don't know about Florida specifically, but in a lot of states if a tenant takes a landlord to court and the landlord has erred at all (in regard to law) the judge will throw the book at them. Might be worth a consult with an attorney or at the very least some good web searching. See if there is a landlord-tenant association in your state or county, they're common and full of excellent resources.   Here's a worksheet I post here frequently that's good to use as a starting point for setting aside reserves:  http://www.freddiemac.com/singlefamily/forms/sell/pdf/998.pdf Depending on the age of everything in your own condo, you might need to set aside 20% of your monthly rent, so that you don't have an unpleasant surprise some day.   You should also familiarize yourself with Fair Housing laws.   You may get some advice here from other landlords but nothing is safer than basing your processes on your local laws. Good luck.   Editing to add: check on your insurance, it may need modified to cover renting out your old unit."
RealEstate,3dfelf,wamazing,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:44:33 2015 UTC,"If you want the benefits of owning rental property without the hassles, you may want to consider using a property manager to take care of your property and collect the rent. These professionals help to reduce the hassles of being a landlord, by taking on the burden of the day-to-day management of the property. That can be a big help, especially if you plan to build a large portfolio of rental properties.  Of course, not all property management companies are the same, and you want to explore your options carefully before signing a contract with any of them. Before you sign up with any property management company, you want to check it’s reputation among rents and neighborhood residents. Some property management companies are not as responsive to tenant problems as they should be, and that could get you in hot water with your renters, and even with the local and state authorities. It is important to choose a property management company that can respond, as quickly to tenant complaints as you want.  It is also important to compare the costs associated with various property management companies. A property management firm typically takes a percentage of the rent roll as their payment, but not all companies charge the same percentage. It is important for you to understand exactly how much you will be spending before you sign up for the services of any property management company.  Once you have selected a property management company, it is important to check up on them and make sure they are holding their end of the bargain. Talk to your tenants and ask them if there are any issues. If you find a rash of complaints about problems the property management company should have taken care of, that should be a big red flag that something is amiss, and that it might be time to see out a more responsible company to take care of your property, your tenants and your real estate investment.  Also, have you ever considered renting out your property on Airbnb? I suggest you look into it and see if it might be a better opportunity for you. You can start you're research with this interesting article. Lastly, check out Mashvisor for more resources on Real Estate investing."

RealEstate,3ddguo,pencilears_mom,10,Wed Jul 15 13:48:45 2015 UTC,"This is the best advice.  And not just photos, take live videos.  If your landlord is part of a larger company with other properties, there is the implied threat that you could go public on twitter, etc with the videos, and damage their reputation with other tenants.  That leverage may be enough to get your money back.   Also, some states have laws which impose a duty on the part of landlords to disclose pest infestations to potential renters.

RealEstate,3ddguo,elf25,3,Wed Jul 15 14:44:34 2015 UTC,"First, make sure the landlord completely followed every letter of the law in the leasing process. For example here in Chicago as a landlord I'm required to provide my tenants with a mold and radon disclosure, a letter telling them where their security deposit is held, written permission to change the locks at their own expense, and a disclosure from utility companies about how much it will cost to heat the apartment. If I fail to provide any of those the tenants can pretty much vacate their lease at any time and seek damages from me in the amount of something like 3x their security deposit. Look at leasing laws in your area and see if you have any loopholes to get out of the lease.   I'm also a pest control expert, as part of my job and the type of infestation you're describing can be very hard to permanently get rid of. The extermination has to remove all of the live insects, eggs, and ingress points or else the problem will keep coming back , especially if the other families in the building keep messy apartments. The building's plumbing and drainage will also have to be addressed because roaches mainly need moisture to survive. In a multi-family building it's going to be a several thousand dollar bill for the Landlord.   That being said do not move into an apartment that's infested with roaches. If it's bad enough they'll infest your couches and any cardboard you have laying around and you'll bring them with you to the next building you move to. Don't sweat the money, seriously. I once bought a condo that had a roach problem and it's just fucking gross to have an immaculately clean kitchen and still open your silverware drawer to find a roach crawling over your forks. I couldn't get rid of them, the building had steam heating with a damp boiler room so they came up from there and bred in the dirty apartments. Gross."

I believe a bug infestation renders the house inhabitable. Talk to the landlord about getting the problem fixed. If he/she is reasonable they will fix it. If not, go see an attorney. They can walk you through breaking the lease and getting your money back..most states have laws about constructive evictions (this is when a landlord does/doesn't do something that makes the place inhabitable)."

You need to learn English, and learn it well.  2) For your first year, ignore the broker split and focus on who has the most valuable training program. Jump ship once you are competent.

You really wouldn't know what the agent's experience is with knowing how to evaluate a house that would likely need repairs   Repairs needed is the home inspector's job, not the realtor's job.

RealEstate,3de3u2,wamazing,4,Wed Jul 15 19:18:53 2015 UTC,"There was a study published (I believe) in 2004 that was a co-project between some guys at Harvard and the Case-Shiller folks. I no longer have the PDF and I have looked many times and can no longer find it online. But I didn't pull this from my ass.   It said that for every 1% increase in interest rates, you lose 10% of the potential buyers at any given price point. I think this makes sense because if more of your payment is interest, you can now afford less house.   The impact of this won't be immediate, although a rate hike does sometimes send a ripple through the market and things cool off for a few months. Sellers will just wait to list, hoping for rates to drop again.   But if rates rise and stay up for any length of time, IMO it will cause prices to drop. This has big implications for potential buyers. If you buy when prices are high and rates are low, you've got a big principal amount that you can't do anything about. If you buy when rates are higher and prices lower, you can always refi if rates drop.   Trying to time the market is a risky game. Buy when you are ready to settle in an area and plan to be there for many years. Get something you can afford without stretching financially because being house-poor sucks. A house is more than an investment, it's a home and security for yourself and a family if you have one."

The market is much more complex than any 1 indicator, and very regional.  Try and look at the case Schiller long term indexes.  Homes appreciate a little over inflation since ww2.

The other big difference IMO between then and now is our economy is much more global now. It wasn't impossible for foreigners to invest in the market then, but it's much easier and accepted now."

RealEstate,3de3u2,TheDumbEnd,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:59:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm trying to understand the economic dynamics of this. While a lower rate will save you money on your mortgage interest, with everyone scrambling to buy now with the impending rate hike around the corner, it's artificially flooding the market with buyers, and sellers can be very picky/not sell under ask. I wonder if the demand decreases after the rate hike, if it will then be more of a buyers market and you will be able to negotiate more with the buyer. Just not sure which one is more significant."
RealEstate,3de3u2,hahcha,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:20 2015 UTC,Prices are high right now in DFW overall because Texas and especially north Texas is getting a large number of companies moving there which brings many people with it. I think that is playing a much larger factor in the Dallas area than rates.  Supply has not been able to catch up with demand. A rate change will have some effect but I doubt it will change much in the area.  Source: Appraiser in Dallas area

The total cost of the mortgage will be affected.  The down payment amount will not increase.  If and when the Feds raise rates say .5% it means housing prices went up .5% when purchased with a mortgage.  .5% is a drop in the bucket and not something to stress over.  .5% makes a $100,000 mortgage only $500 more expensive.  $500 over 15/30 years is nothing."

Are you sure your sales price was 174K?  Or was that the asking price?  So your offer was 161K and the seller was giving you 5K towards your closing costs, which means that the seller was netting 156K from the sale?   Appraisal came in at $169K.   If the appraisal comes in at or above your purchase price (the number that is written on your contract), you are all set."
RealEstate,3dfbxn,sharkizzle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:58:44 2015 UTC,I think I worded it wrong: So the asking price on realtor.com was $174 but they quickly grabbed our offer of $167 with seller paying $6K(I thought it was 5K) so the seller is netting $161K according to our disclosures.  I guess since our offer of $167k (plus 6K seller costs) is less than appraisal of $169K then we are still set?

I couldn't understand how sellers are asked to pay CC but our realtor said we could so we asked for 6K and they accepted, but technically they dont actually pay out 6K to the lender, the lender just lowers the contract price and puts a credit of 6K towards CC? So thats why you mention 8K in equity since my actual price of contract was 161K for the sale of the home BEFORE CC?"
RealEstate,3dfbxn,Breakpoint,2,Thu Jul 16 15:16:10 2015 UTC,"That's good for you, as it means you don't need to worry about bringing cash to the table. Lenders typically use whichever is less, the sales price or appraised value, to calculate LTV.   Don't tell the seller or their agent. I wouldn't even tell my agent. If they find out they could have gotten more money they might not be terribly cooperative if any issues come up between now and closing. Like if something breaks. If anyone asks, tell them the appraisal came back ""fine.""   Appraisals are confidential to the lender. The lender can tell you (and anyone else they want, it's up to them) but the seller has no rights to it. They are done to ensure a proper lending transaction and that's your business, not theirs.

Unlikely that anything will come up that is a problem but if you need to get a question answered or something, might be good to have a contact.

Here are two of them: 1) Tell your agent you want to be referred to someone else for the closing date on the contract if they will not be in town.

The reason being is the file must first go through the normal underwriting process at the lender. Once that is completed, the file is turned over to USDA for their underwriting. Normal processing times once it hits USDA is 3 to 4 weeks. The catch is that if USDA flags the file, and requests more info, or something needs to be changed once that is done the file goes back to the bottom of the pile and you are waiting another 3-4 weeks.

Also, I like to clean with bleach or bleach-based cleaners (in bathrooms, specifically, but also in parts of kitchen like sink and counters). Cleaning services seem to be anti-bleach... I think what bugs me most about this is whatever products the services do use don't leave the house with that really clean smell. And one more thing I wish cleaning services did a better job on is dusting/cleaning baseboards, doors, light switches, and window sills and the part of the window where the locks are.

RealEstate,3ddplj,semichaels,3,Wed Jul 15 13:45:04 2015 UTC,I am buying right now.  The seller had purchased this house ad a foreclosure years ago.  She didn't get a full title report when she bought it.  I think that is common in a foreclosure.  I got title insurance and that comes with a more detailed title report.  Turns out there are no loans on the property but there is a certificate of non compliance from the city.  I guess there was sent unpermitted work on the house.  So now the seller is scrambling to get this work permitted before we can close escrow.  So get title insurance even if they are not offing it to you.
RealEstate,3ddplj,somethingventured,3,Wed Jul 15 13:55:59 2015 UTC,No that's incorrect. You should and are well within your right to get a full title report. I'm not sure why someone would buy a property without one.

If the buyer closed with a stripped down title, or whatever the case, it wasn't because they were forced. OP is saying that her agent is telling her that it is common for foreclosure buyers to be forced to close without running title, which is false. They always have the option."
RealEstate,3ddplj,LennyLongshoes,2,Wed Jul 15 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"Many times the reason something is selling as a foreclosure is because it needs extensive repairs. Not always, but, be looking out for things like this when shopping for houses. Lenders have minimum property standards/requirements. All major systems and structure but be functional and in good working order. Stuff can be old, but, it must work as designed.   Lots of times people get excited about homes because they are so cheap, without realizing that only a cash buyer (or, in some cases FHA 203K buyer) can actually buy the place. If you have cash, you're in a great position because the discount will likely be more than the sum of all repairs. These are the kinds of homes flippers look for because they can get it for a steep discount, make repairs, and still turn a profit when they sell.   The permit issue has become a big problem in recent years after GSEs started forcing buybacks for this reason. Lenders now won't make a loan if the house had major work or additions that were not inspected and signed off on. Insurance companies may use a lack of permits to get out of paying a claim. Be very careful before getting in too deep with a place like this. The seller has to get the local municipality to issue retroactive permits. This can be expensive and time consuming, and if things weren't done to code, they may need redone.   DO NOT put any money into a house that you don't yet own. You have no rights to this, and, by making a small repair you may have raised the value so much that the seller wants to put it back on the market for more than you were willing to pay, and there isn't a thing you can do about it. Good luck in your search."
RealEstate,3ddplj,wamazing,3,Wed Jul 15 16:09:54 2015 UTC,"When buying a foreclosure, remember that you will be dealing with a large bureaucracy that does not care about you. You will never have an opportunity to talk to or reason with the asset manager in charge of getting that property sold. That makes getting your own agent even more important. They are serious about deadlines, but not so serious about being prompt themselves.  A lot of people will say you are getting a huge discount, but it's not that big (banks want to get the most money just like any seller). You'll be buying ""as is"" and 99% of the time you won't get them to make any repairs whatsoever, so read the bank's Property Condition Report and be sure you get a really good home inspector.  Make sure you keep your lender in the loop at all times, both concerning deadlines and property condition.  Banks Always Make Their Own Rules (the BAMTOR Principle). Don't forget it.  Good luck!"
RealEstate,3ddplj,ShortWoman,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:08:08 2015 UTC,So beyond a Property Condition Report are there any other forms I should be asking for from the agent? We are going to take a look at the house tonight with the agent. We have looked at other houses recently and were given some seller disclosure papers which I am assuming this property condition report is equal to that...
RealEstate,3ddplj,ShortWoman,2,Wed Jul 15 16:51:13 2015 UTC,"Please tell me that when you say ""the agent"" you mean your buyers agent and not the guy whose name is on the sign. The guy on the sign has a contract that says he looks after the interests of the bank first and foremost. He will only look after you as much as state law requires (not very damn much), and will earn a double payday for doing so.  All states require certain disclosures including ones about known problems, but remember that the bank never lived in the house. So things that might be obvious if you lived there? They don't know. A PCR on the other hand is an inventory of stuff that the bank's representative specifically noticed was wrong. It's mostly going to be big issues. Not all banks do these. If the property was built before 1978 a form saying there might or might not be lead paint is required by federal law."
RealEstate,3ddplj,landofmisfits,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:58:03 2015 UTC,"Many banks don't even do property condition reports on their properties, and often ones that do send it with all of the other addendums once price and terms are agreed upon and not in advance.  Fannie Mae would be an exception, you have to sign all addendums along with your offer.  HUD would be another exception, everything is online.  Keep in mind the property condition reports come from information that an agent or property preservation company passes on to the seller.  We are not home inspectors and it will not necessarily be a comprehensive list, just the obvious items that you will likely notice yourself anyway.  Many times utilities are not on and any items that require them to be on were visually inspected only.  Some banks are starting to repair properties and sell them closer to true market value.  I would be more wary of these than the ones that are sold AS IS at a discount.  They are not done to the standards that someone flipping houses typically does and most times only complete a partial repair rather than a full rehab.  Find a buyer's agent that is familiar with both foreclosures and with home repair.  I disagree with u/ShortWoman about calling the listing agent in the specific case of foreclosures.  Listing agents typically know more about the house and process than anyone else, though the listing agent can't share anything that would compromise their fiduciary responsibility to the seller, there is still a wealth of information about the house that they have.  If you don't want to work in a dual agent representation, a phone call to the listing agent doesn't hurt, you will typically get more information, and as long as you use your own agent to show you the house and draft the paperwork, you have the best of both worlds.  A foreclosure can be a great deal for an educated buyer, and a disaster for someone who isn't."

Monthly taxes and insurance are $328. Monthly mortgage payments are $1,802.  Assuming I can rent at the top end ($3k), before accounting for vacancies or maintenance, I'm looking at ~$2,400 NOI/month or $28,800/year. $28,800/$486,000 equals 5.9%.

Where I pay all-cash, I will use cap-rate.   If put down $100k and get back $8k in cash flow after all expenses, I consider that pretty good.  A couple of monthly set-asides I think you have overlooked are vacancy ($100/month), insurance (maybe $50/month), reserve fund for general wear/tear and major capital expenditures that you will inevitably have ($300/month) and property management fees ($200/month). So in total you are looking at $3,088/month.  Even if you rent out the place at the top end of the market, you will operate at a small loss, before taxes. After taxes you will have a small gain when you account for depreciation, expenses, etc."
RealEstate,3ddwwr,b6passat,2,Wed Jul 15 16:56:24 2015 UTC,"before accounting for vacancies or maintenance,   If you don't account for these, you're not deriving the true NOI of the property, so there's no sense in applying a cap rate analysis.  I agree with /u/ak_NYC that equity dividend (""cash on cash"") is the best way to look at this, account for all expenses, including debt service, to see if you have any real return.  If there's no annual income, you may still have a good yield if you expect appreciation, but the market knows that is no guarantee.  Have a realistic expectation of income, and estimate high on the expenses, is the only way to find a good deal in income properties.  You are blue-skying the rent already, if you also blue-sky the vacancy, you'll probably overestimate your income."

RealEstate,3de42z,hahcha,4,Wed Jul 15 15:39:39 2015 UTC,"Part of my job as an appraiser is to analyze sales prices.   If I see a price that is ""low"" as compared to the comps, I always call the agents (both of them) and ask why. It's amazing what the agents will tell you after the deal is done.   Never, not once, not ONE SINGLE time was the low price due to the buyer not having an agent.   Now if an agent themselves is buying a house, that frequently shows up as a low price. They reduce the price in lieu of taking a commission because of tax implications. But it just never ends up getting passed onto a buyer. In my experience anyway."
RealEstate,3de42z,wamazing,2,Wed Jul 15 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  Do you call out of curiosity or would there be problems if you find it low?  If low prices are never due to double commission, is it because there was something wrong with the interiors?  Someone died on the property?"
RealEstate,3de42z,wamazing,3,Wed Jul 15 16:45:03 2015 UTC,"Well my job is to decide if a 'low' comp is a sign of the market dropping. And say you appraise something for $100K, but there was a very similar house that sold for $95K, underwriters and investors might question this, and ask why is this worth more than that house? You can be accused of inflating values if you don't do your homework.   Common reasons why houses sell low:   Something came back in the inspection and it needed a huge repair.  Heavy smokers/hoarders/poor condition  ""Old people decorating""   Sellers under duress due to divorce/relocation  Some odd feature/layout (a bedroom that basically has a hallway through it and isn't private).   Investment property and wants a low sale due to tax implications.   Originally listed way too high, was stigmatized with 200+ days on market now no one wants to touch it. VERY COMMON.   Estate sale wanted fast sale. Never seen a low sale because someone died in the house, it's more likely that the heirs want the money NOW.   The one I remember most, because it's such a shame, was a lovely property on a few acres of desert in an upscale northern suburb of Phoenix (Carefree). A family had owned it for years. When the market was booming they decided to sell. They didn't want to pay 6% for a listing agent so they sent their son to get his real estate license (which costs about $400) and had him list and sell the house. Unfortunately, because he was a total noob and the family didn't really know what the market was doing they listed the place about $80K low. When I called the buyer's agent to ask WTF is up with this price he was positively GIDDY about it and laughing heartily at the idiots who were too cheap to pay an agent, but ended up shorting themselves three times that amount. Ouch. So when people post here that they want to sell their own homes, I cringe a bit inside for them. I'm sure some of them do OK, but, in my experience using an agent is wise."
RealEstate,3de42z,wamazing,2,Wed Jul 15 17:02:54 2015 UTC,The son didn't need a license to list the property right?  Why didn't they do FSBO?  Listing low isn't a problem in the SF bay area as sales can easily go 100k over ask.  Everyone can see the comps; wonder what the son did to come up with that low number.  Perhaps not taking account sq ft and just comparing BR/BA.
RealEstate,3de42z,wamazing,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:20:37 2015 UTC,"They wanted it listed in the MLS. From talking to the other agent it seems like mom knew everything and basically told the son what to do.   During that time, prices were going up so quickly, that I'd get a lot of ""you're SURE about that?"" when appraising. People in cookie cutter subdivisions could be $100K low if they weren't market watchers. So I doubt they really did a search of any kind. They probably knew someone down the street who sold their house last year, and said, ours is worth $50K more and called it a day. They were presumably happy with the deal they got so, just happened to be that buyer's lucky day (year.... decade....)"
RealEstate,3de42z,dogwood876,2,Wed Jul 15 19:52:51 2015 UTC,"FSBO can list on MLS too, for a small fee and no agents' license required.  When you see a sale that looks high, is it still an issue to be followed up, or is high not a problem?  I do notice some agents knowing insider info on pending homes and that can be a big advantage during fast times.  So if a seller does his searches, he shouldn't be more than a month behind, though of course a month can make a noticeable difference."
RealEstate,3de42z,wamazing,2,Wed Jul 15 20:15:16 2015 UTC,"Yep high sales get a call too. I've been known to knock on doors if the agents (on high or low sales) don't get back to me. It's CYA as the best I can. You learn a lot about the market doing this. I know a lot of appraisers were really out of touch with what was going on in any given market. I'd hear this from friends dealing with them on their own deals, and I have a few realtor friends as well. I never wanted to be that appraiser.   High sales usually involve concessions or personal property included (once it was a car, and not a cheap one) and lenders want those backed out.   Something else that can throw off a comp is if the square footage turns out to be bigger or smaller than the MLS listing or tax records. The realtors never go back in and edit their listings lol. Didn't happen often, but a few times it did.   And sometimes I just wouldn't use a comp that was really an anomaly, either low or high, because I couldn't figure out what was going on and it was way out of whack with everything else. Or I'd use it and just put least weight on it due to not being able to explain it. One comp does not make an appraisal (although sometimes agents or homeowners don't want to hear that lol)."

RealEstate,3de42z,zooch76,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:12:37 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed the appraising part of it, very much. Figuring out what's going on in a market, the human behavior involved in that, and translating that to dollars, is really interesting to me.   What I don't like is that very few of the people who hire you actually care what something is truly worth. They just want the number they need to make their deal work. I don't like that after the crash regulators encouraged lenders to use management companies who keep half the fee to do nothing but ask me stupid questions. I don't like that the FDIC is suing appraisers 10 years or more after the deal was done, and that some of their supposed claims were things like going more than a mile for a comp (which is totally fine if there are not good comps closer). I don't like that if you did your job well everyone can still be pissed at you and file a complaint against you - that even if you're cleared, can haunt you for years in higher insurance premiums etc. I don't like that this basically comes down to a $20/hour job if you're doing residential. I don't appraise any more and don't know if it's something I even have any desire to go back to if the market were to make a miraculous recovery."
RealEstate,3de42z,Ireallydontwork,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"I've double sided deals many times but really prefer each side have their own representation. There are a lot of factors that come into play when it comes to reducing commission. If the clients are buying and selling, I'll usually cut one side. If I bring a buyer on a listing and the sellers are also going to buy, I'll cut the list side 1 or 2% depending on price point.   My states offer a facilitator status where an agent doesn't represent either party in the transaction. The tough thing is getting your original clients to agree to drop representation. Another option is if you work with a buyer and they decide to offer on your listing, insist that they have representation and refer them to an agent in your office. Then collect a 30% referral...just an option."

RealEstate,3de42z,sendakattack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:07:08 2015 UTC,"His thinking is that he can just get his own agent, creating a split commission, so offering double commission even with a discount could benefit the listing agent.

RealEstate,3de42z,sendakattack,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:33 2015 UTC,"Double ending a deal creates a lot of other legal issues. Agents have to be very careful not to cross any lines one way or the other (client or customer)  They will still be involved in paperwork, inspections etc.   If your boss wanted you to do a double shift but only get a 1/3 of the pay for the second shift would you?  I offer some discount, but I don't discuss value of the discount until the deal is done. I've been burnt before by saying sure I'll knock off 1.5% then the buyers are very high maintenance people, and I needed to hold their hands so much it ended up costing me more money than it was worth."

Second, I can tell even though it's blurry that he is using home inspector pro which is one of the best programs for inspectors that use a mobile device in the field. The only thing I dislike is that he is using the check boxes. I have edited them out of the software and think it gives a much nicer appearance if the report is all narrative.  Thirdly, summary at the top is a bad idea. It encourages people to not read the whole report which is extremely informative if written by a good inspector."

RealEstate,3dc3z6,ArtieLange,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:29:20 2015 UTC,That is a decent report. I prefer the Horizon reporting system and the deficiencies are in point form and it automatically populates the implications. Also the reports are a little more presentable.  I agree with you on not using the Summary. If one of the items that is not on that list ends up being expensive you have a lawsuit. Take for example the slow draining sink. 9 times out of 10 it's a simple obstructed trap. But that one time it's missing venting and a gong show to fix.

I've read a bunch of people here that we're unhappy with their inspector, found out stuff after inspection, or got very short reports.

RealEstate,3dc3z6,Dubsland12,3,Wed Jul 15 11:22:19 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, it'd be nice if every inspector used a package like this (although I think there is danger of information overload), but at the end of the day what matters is if they convey information on problems/potential problems.  If that's a one page, hand written report that conveys the information, that's better than a pretty 45 page report that fails to."
RealEstate,3dc3z6,Ithurtsprecious,3,Wed Jul 15 11:36:52 2015 UTC,"Home inspections vary immensely.  As stated here it's about quality not quantity of info.  A bunch of pre written stuff isn't going to matter to me much, I want specifics.  The best inspector I've ever worked with is an older man with a PHD in Structural Engineering.  He is qualified to write a report on the Twin Towers collapse. ( Yes he believes the official report).  But, he's $500 for a 1700 sq ft house.  I use him when I have structural concerns.  I have used others for the Homes that are more straight forward for $2-300.  I use my wife's broker that is a real estate attorney for title and property line or lien issues.  I often call out pros for repair estimates on concern areas such as roofs rather than rely on inspectors that are more generalists.  Honestly they often just put thermometers in front of ducting, look at the roof from a ladder, check the breaker Box, and plug in a circuit checker to all the outlets, and look for dry rot and leaks.  I worry mostly about the big ticket items since I'm buying deals."

RealEstate,3ddn9u,welmoed,5,Wed Jul 15 13:23:54 2015 UTC,"It can be appraised, but GSE lenders aren't going to like it. The ""system"" wants round pegs in round holes and square pegs get penalized. Of course this is because over time they have proven to be riskier. So for starters, I'd suggest to any potential buyer that they look for a local bank that keeps their own loans on the books. You will also need a buyer with a good down payment, 20% or more, will encourage a lender to see less risk in making that loan.   As far as appraising it, you fall back on the fundamentals. Find everything you can with the unusual features. Go out in distance, go back in time, use a ton of listings to show the competitive market, do a SUPER SOLID cost approach (not the PFA method most appraisers use). I once did an appraisal for a divorce based solely on the cost approach. It would have given a lender an aneurysm but both sides and the judge were pleased with it. Because there was not one shred of market evidence to suggest anything other than what I concluded.   These kind of appraisals are done defensively. Throw everything in the market into your analysis, decide what is relevant, throw out the non-relevant stuff, and draw your conclusion based on what is left. Interviewing agents is not out of the question here, either, especially if they have been working in that area for a long time.   What you want to end up with is such a good analysis that no one can say you missed anything, or that you're wrong because of X. If you've done your job well no one can refute anything in the report, and they're left with nothing to do but agree with your opinion, because it's so well supported. This is not a job for the cheap and fast appraiser. This is not a job to be run through an AMC. Is this going to be a number that thrills a seller? Perhaps not but the concept of over-improvement and extremely personal design are real. Just because one person loved it, does not mean the rest of the world will share that opinion. If you want to sell it to someone who needs a loan, you gotta play by those rules.   Before you put the house on the market, I'd interview appraisers in your area and get a feel for how they handle these kinds of challenges. I always enjoyed them, I knew my $$$ per hour wasn't going to be impressive because I'd take a lot of time but I like a puzzle and this is what that is. If you hire an appraiser up front, tell them you want a listing appraisal, see what they find. http://www.appraisalinstitute.org/ Make sure you tell them you don't want a trainee, you don't want something where they stayed inside arbitrary GSE lines, you really want their experienced and reasoned opinion, based on data. You want to be able to question them after the fact, as to why they did this or that.   You should be able to tell within a few minutes of a phone conversation whether you are talking to someone who is competent to do this. Good luck."

RealEstate,3ddn9u,HarryWaters,2,Wed Jul 15 14:57:54 2015 UTC,"For a property that odd, an appraisal is probably going to be worthless.

RealEstate,3dcuc6,draconis183,2,Wed Jul 15 07:17:01 2015 UTC,"Some numbers for you (without having exact figures).  85k sale price. 25% down = $21,250 Maintenance: After 10 years my average seems to be about $100 per door per month. So 2 units = $200. Property Management: $110 Vacancy: $180 Assume Morgatge 30yrs @ 6% = $385 ($383.71).  So...  Gross monthly rent: $1100 - $385 (mortgage) - $200 (maint.) - $110 (prop managemnt) - $180 (vacancy) - $100 (taxes) - $100 (insurance) = $25 net income per month.  Even if we reduce maintenance to $100 per month and assume taxes and insurance are only $75 each this leaves you with a net profit of $175 per month.   On top of that your one year cash on cash return in a BEST case would be: $175 x 12 =$2100 / $21,250 down payment = 10% cash on cash when rounded up.  Remember I'm not including the several thousand dollars in maintenance you believe it will take.  Unless there is some number I'm filling in that is significantly off...You will have to forgive me if I don't consider this a good opportunity.  As I'm not privy to the ""real"" numbers regarding taxes, insurance, etc. it could very well cash flow a little more. Depending on your market I'd aim to net at least $200 a door. With your current net rents one major repair would wipe out your profits for a year or more."

RealEstate,3dcuc6,caerus1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:14:39 2015 UTC,"This is a great start. You can check with the local utility company to figure out what the exact utility costs have been. Make sure you also factor in lawn care, parking, and taxes. For maintenance, a very conservative estimate is 50% of rental income. I would personally look up the cost of replacing the two most expensive things in the house (roof, and maybe floors) and build a reserve big enough to account for those expenses. Lenders will like that you are ready to invest more in the asset's upkeep since that is going to be their collateral."

Also, where did your vacancy assumption come from? Vacancy rate is a make or break for a investment property. Make sure that you've done the research and have a vacancy rate that is very accurate (or as close as possible).   What locations are you looking into? Are you focused on one area or multiple areas?

But the owners of the 100 acres have the legal right to do whatever they want with their land, within the constraints of zoning laws etc.   If you don't like the plans that have been made (the zoning regs currently in place) for the land around you, the time to speak up is when the zoning is being put in place or changed.

RealEstate,3dbs5b,NumNumLobster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:47:55 2015 UTC,"Varies state by state. For those states that do require you to disclose deaths, you really have to be careful about what you say. IIRC in NC you don't have to disclose even if you know it. But if you do disclose, you can't specify why if the person is part of a protected class (ADA). Best example I can think of is if someone had AIDS and died of it in the house.  If I'm wrong someone correct me. I've been out of the game for a while now."

RealEstate,3db6uj,Orlyborly,5,Wed Jul 15 02:16:29 2015 UTC,"As an agent, he has an actual professional  person to point a finger at if anyone calls him on using the higher footage. It's all about covering his ass. And it's not a bad deal for you in this case.  If a professional appraiser says x I'm going to use x. Builder plans have changes, slight errors, etc. county records will be based off builders application. Some builders make plans slightly smaller to save on permits, but not small enough a building inspector would notice or care."
RealEstate,3db6uj,Ireallydontwork,4,Tue Jul 14 23:19:13 2015 UTC,I agree with the agent. And there is a lot of case law that says real estate listings and ads are buyer beware.  I doubt you could be sued for that.
RealEstate,3db6uj,wamazing,3,Tue Jul 14 22:49:21 2015 UTC,Depends on state.  Where do you live?  Maybe someone from there can weigh in.  In KY for res listing agents won't ushually even discuss sf because there is precedent to nail them if they are wrong .  I'd assume that applies to sellers too.  In Ohio no one cares and that type of info is generally never guaranteed to be true.  Those are the only two states I have any idea about.
RealEstate,3db6uj,NumNumLobster,2,Tue Jul 14 22:49:15 2015 UTC,"It's so funny, being in SW Ohio sqft has almost nothing to do with selling real estate.  I do a lot of foreclosure work and basing everything off of sqft for them can really inflate or deflate a market price here."
RealEstate,3db6uj,landofmisfits,3,Wed Jul 15 04:44:14 2015 UTC,The appraiser measured the brick and motor. The records are from the plans. Use the real person's measurement. Chances are that the next measurement will be different anyway.

RealEstate,3db0hl,phonics_monkey,2,Wed Jul 15 01:36:11 2015 UTC,"In Wisconsin the Tenant Resource center helped me out of this situation. In WI the law expects reasonable efforts by the landlord to re-fill the space. Because our landlord had put forth no ads, signs, info, etc. to fill the space for nearly a month, we were able to use that as proof of a lack of effort on the part of the owner.  At the end of it, we only had to pay 2 months rent even though the space was empty for 3 months because there was no proof of the landlord actively trying to fill the space for the first month of the 60-day notice. After the ads went up finally, the space was filled pretty quickly."
RealEstate,3db0hl,wamazing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:48:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the tip. I've been in contact with one and emailed him my lease. I'm afraid of the delay in posting for rent, and I'm sending my 60 day notice certified mail for a receipt/proof.  I'd be willing to give him 5 days to put up a sign as that can make all the difference.  He said it ""in best case scenario"" that Sept would be my last month. But 60 days is Sept 3rd/4th. So that's only 1 month and some change for rent, and not 2 more rental payments."
RealEstate,3dbo7m,massarogi,2,Wed Jul 15 00:47:18 2015 UTC,"Homepath is a Freddie Mac listing, I list properties for Freddie Mac.  I can share what I know but I don't know if it is just locally or across the board with Freddie Mac.  First off, first look has been changed to 20 days, not 15, it was 15 for a long time, but that changed maybe around a year ago to be 20 days.  Secondly, Freddie does not negotiate percentage wise a lot off of the list price, especially when it is first listed, and any offer you make will be countered, even if it is just closing date, title company etc.  Your offer depends on your local agent's knowledge of the market and how much competition you will have.  Freddie will look at the type of loan that you have when they look at your offer.  A comparable conventionally financed offer will be given preference.  Does the home require these repairs to be habitable, or is it in need of updating?  If it is required for habitability you may not obtain a conventional loan.  If it is just updating, lessen your down payment and put your own money toward repairs versus going 203k.  There is 203k and 203k streamline, streamline only allows for 35k in repairs, a full blown 203k I do not think has limits as long as the as repaired/updated value is justified with the amount you are spending."
RealEstate,3dbo7m,landofmisfits,2,Wed Jul 15 01:08:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply!  The home needs repairs to be habitable. There are no bathrooms (completely empty just piping left) and the kitchen just has a sink with a counter, nothing else. The rest of the rooms are all empty. I'm going to assume I will need an FHA loan, but will speak with my lender tomorrow to see what they can offer me."
RealEstate,3dbo7m,landofmisfits,2,Wed Jul 15 01:26:14 2015 UTC,"Then it sounds like Freddie realizes that this is either going to be an FHA 203k loan or a cash offer so unless a cash offer comes along, you won't be in competition with other loans as any loan will have to be a renovation loan."
RealEstate,3dbo7m,wamazing,2,Wed Jul 15 02:35:22 2015 UTC,"Most (GSE) lenders will not make a loan except for a 203K on a house that needs repairs to be habitable.   I have seen some 203K that were pretty nice, I think you're only limited by the loan you can qualify for and what it will appraise for once complete. If you've heard they are strict I suspect this is more about not letting people borrow more than the appraisal (as if repaired). But I'm certainly not an expert on these loans so it's really a question for a loan officer who does them."
RealEstate,3dbo7m,aardy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:39:31 2015 UTC,"There are conventional renovation programs, FHA isn't the only game in town. And I wouldn't necessarily assume the HUD consultant is going to be obnoxious.   REOs are unique in that the seller is already (usually) going to take for-freaking-ever to sell the place, so a reno loan isn't going to delay closing. REO + Reno is often a model match.  The issue you may have is that the contractor is supposed to be ""arms length."" Your dad is not arms length. But he does have contractor buddies who are."
RealEstate,3dawie,abegosum,8,Tue Jul 14 21:18:55 2015 UTC,"Nothing is fishy here.  In my market Zillow will pick up my MLS listings, but this can take a few days. (I claim them also because I pay to be a Premier agent for leads) But Zillow is a terrible website as far as accuracy, most Realtors will steer people off it immediately as soon as they pick them up as clients.  Of course she is not doing the showings, buyers agents are.  Unless you have a luxury home its rare for listing agents to also show the home (unless they are bringing a possible buyer) from a sign call/zillow listing lead.  Also not all Realtors waste time giving feedback.  I sometimes show motivated buyers 4-10 houses a day.  Do you think I really remember your exact house when I just hear your street address? lol.  Also buyers agents cancel appointments, it happens, maybe their buyers picked a better house then yours or maybe their buyers flaked, or maybe 100 other possible reasons.   You want more showings? Reduce your price to a competitive range.  Good houses with competitive prices will be under contract in a week."

Now all the interested buyers will come and see that a lot of people looking at the property. I'll then have a highest best on Tuesday or Wednesday. It usually produces a bidding war and my clients get top dollar with limited to no contingencies.  If one of the buyers happens to my client or someone I met at the open house, I can lower my commission 1% since I am getting both sides.

RealEstate,3dawie,TheBadBoyManBoy,2,Wed Jul 15 00:29:57 2015 UTC,"My market is likely not your market, but my open house experience was surprisingly negative, which might or might not be useful for you to consider.  On our multiple whirlwind weekend showings our agent brought us to 2 different open houses; it was a weird vibe because I spent more mental space watching the interaction of realtors than I did to the houses themselves.  The houses were fine but something about having two or three other potential buyers wandering around at the same time as us just made everything kind of sour.  Seeing other people wandering around a house we might want to live in made us want to live in it much, much less.  Aside from the emotional aspect, we weren't in a hurry to buy, and even an inkling of ""bidding war"" was enough to make us cross off the listing and move on.  (Ours was a midwest ""seller's market"" in that properties in reasonable shape remained on market for 2-3 weeks on average; I know this is probably considered slow on the west coast.)  But hey, free cookies. :)"

RealEstate,3dawie,madfer,4,Tue Jul 14 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"I doubt she dropped the ball with Zillow. Zillow usually updates itself and is slow in many markets.   Open houses don't sell houses, they're for getting clients. The serious buyers have agents and don't have to wait until a house is open. http://www.realtor.com/advice/true-purpose-open-houses/  Many realtors don't give feedback.  They suck, sorry. This isn't your agent's fault and the fact that she's called them twice indicates that she's doing her job.   The only legitimate complaint I see is that she forgot to tell you about the truth in lending requirement.    You're emotional about this sale, understandably. Try to relax and call your agent if you're worried."
RealEstate,3dawie,earthpeesfire,3,Wed Jul 15 03:20:00 2015 UTC,"Separate the issues.  First, you need to understand what her plan is for marketing your house and hold her to it. It sounds like you had a discussion, but didn't get into the actual plan. That should have been a consideration before you listed with her, but water under the bridge.  As for feedback, I can tell you from experience that you don't always get feedback from people viewing the house. You can request it and leave messages, but no guarantees.   Its not to late to do the first step above. You need to sit down with her and ask the questions. Many agents specialize in either buy-side or sell-side, so a buy-side agent is not necessarily a good listing agent."

If damage is due to tenant's negligence (fire, etc.) the lease as written means the repairs are on you.  If you burn the place down, that's a problem.  I can't offer an opinion on the legality of that specific phrasing since IANAL, but that's what your insurance is for.  You don't want him coming after you for the cost of the building, and you don't want his insurance company subrogating against you in that instance, either.  I'd bank on the insurance company having better lawyers than he does, from that lease.  If you think the insurance company would just write that off in a clear case of negligence/stupidity, [http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2014/04/woman_sued_for_2_million_after.html](think again).  $500k liability (and 15-20k for your stuff) will probably cost you less than $200 a year."

RealEstate,3dbdby,ShortWoman,2,Tue Jul 14 23:33:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Based on pictures & price the house is a great deal. After talking to the landlord I'm pretty sure they are just an idiot, whether that's good or bad I'm not sure.  The current tenants move out tomorrow and the landlord said I can come take a look at the place and if I like it I can start moving in tomorrow. Not part of my plans, but they made no mention of cleaning it or anything. So I'm pretty sure they're just an idiot. I'm gonna take a look at it for the hell of it, to meet the current tenants and possibly the landlord.  What redflags made you think your opinion about the landlord?"
RealEstate,3dbdby,NumNumLobster,2,Tue Jul 14 23:56:55 2015 UTC,Sounds like they are refusing to do any maintenance to me and just the way that is written is horrible.  I've heard that name too but can't place it.  When I Google it their NY properties got horrible reviews.  Is this in clifton?

""Tenant may be required to pay other charges to Landlord under the terms of this Lease. They are to be called “added rent.”"" WTF, does that mean he can raise the rent at any time for any reason?? Idiot is willing to accept installment payments of rent? Further, his items on late fees show that he has no understanding of standard rental accounting.  It sounds very much as if you are responsible for all maintenance beyond the heater and the water. Also not going to fix the AC if it dies? **** that! ""Landlord shall have the right to decide which part of the Apartment is usable. Landlord need only repair the damaged structural parts of the Apartment."" Aw how cute, he wants to follow the law. Sort of. ""Sure, I'll replace the burnt support beam, but not the drywall."" The landlord reserves the right to cancel the lease with 30 days notice. You? Not so much.  Clumsy wording of his right to evict, which technically says he can just come in and literally toss you out, oh yeah and go to court too. No understanding whatsoever of bankruptcy, which shouldn't effect a leased apartment pretty much at all. ""Any admission or conviction of a crime will give the Landlord the option of immediately terminating lease."" Not ""conviction of a felony.""

This allows the owner to evict over 'reasonable' charges when they wouldn't be able to otherwise. It also makes paying these items priority along with rent. At least it's normal in my location as a way for the landlord to protect themselves if say the tenant stops paying utilities they had agreed to pay but a judge wouldn't normally evict over."

RealEstate,3d95p8,spinlock,13,Wed Jul 15 02:03:33 2015 UTC,"So the realtor took it upon herself to engage an engineer, and (via text) gave you the impression that this would not cost you anything until closing? I'm sorry but, she went out on a limb, the engineer should look to her for payment. IANAL but you have no obligation to the engineer, you have no contract with him.   She was doing things behind your back trying to ""save"" the deal (aka her commission) and it's on her. Perhaps an unfortunate lesson in ethical behavior is in order. I'd send the bill back to the engineer and advise him to please bill the agent with her contact info.   I know it sucks to pay for inspections and walk away from a house. But that might be the best money you ever spend, if it keeps you from getting into a money pit.   FWIW, anytime you look at something flipped, ask if they pulled permits for anything that required it. Most cities and counties require permits for anything involving electric or gas, plumbing, or structural things. Ask if the updates they made meet current code. It's no guarantee because someone can still flip a house and just make cosmetic fixes and never even need to pull a permit. But in a lot of cases you can save your time and money and not even consider that house, if they didn't pull permits (where required). Lenders have become very strict about this and even if a house passed inspections but the appraiser finds out permits weren't pulled, it's very unlikely that the lender will make the loan. And guess what - you're out your inspection fees AND the appraisal fee.   People do crazy things in hot markets, including agents. I had an agent once forge my signature on a document making my earnest money ($5,000) non-refundable. I did end up getting my money back but it was a fight. You sound like a cautious and careful person, keep that up, try not to get discouraged, you're learning a lot about houses and when the right one pops up you'll know it and everything will fall into place perfectly. Good luck."
RealEstate,3d95p8,romerom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:39:04 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm really trying to look at this $1500 as having saved us over $10K in the long run (the $390 definitely did, because our agent originally tried to talk us OUT of the structural inspection, and we would have proceeded and been stuck with the repair!). It just sucks, because now we're stuck waiting to buy trying to recoup that money, and interest rates are only going to go up. I'm also trying to pat myself on the back for staving off the appraisal as long as I could, because that would have been another $400 wasted (not wasted, as you're an appraiser, but you know what I mean).  I didn't even think about the permit thing-that is great advice! If we look at another flip, I'm definitely doing that.   And I cannot believe an agent would do that-but in markets like these, I shouldn't be surprised! Sometimes the money isn't even worth the fight that you have to put up and the emotional drain, but thank goodness there was a happy ending for you."
RealEstate,3d95p8,wamazing,3,Tue Jul 14 15:12:59 2015 UTC,"You should pull the permits on any house you're looking at. I once got into contract on a place with a pretty nice kitchen that was put in 10 years ago and needed a little updating. When I pulled the permits, I learned that they failed an inspection 10 years ago, never resolved the issue and just finished the renovation without getting the inspector to sign off. So, if we wanted to do anything that would get the city looking into the house, they'd make us rip out the old kitchen, fix whatever was wrong, and finish the inspection that should have been done 10 years ago.  The crazy thing is that the current owners had no idea because they didn't remodel the kitchen. They were super pissed at me because I walked away and then they had to disclose the fucked up kitchen to every other potential buyer."
RealEstate,3d95p8,PhredPhnerd,2,Tue Jul 14 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"Holy shit. Unreal. People are so shady. I guess would feel a lot worse if we were dealing with a family/couple, but these are the same idiots that bought the fucked up house in the first place, so, their loss. I hope the BOM throws up red flags for other buyers, and these assholes get stuck with this house for months to come.  AND I actually feel a LOT better right now than I did when I wrote this post...just saw on the MLS that the flippers threw up another house we looked at months ago (pre-flip) and did not even put an offer on because with my inexperienced eyes, I could tell it had MAJOR water damage in the basement (like, water pouring through a quarter inch crack). They bought it for $20K under list (unheard of in my area right now), I'm assuming because they brought the crack to the seller's attention.  Just checked out the listing photos, and there's the crack, barely visible through the 10 layers of paint the flippers slopped on. You wouldn't know it was there if you weren't looking for it. I kind of want to set up a lemonade stand across the street and warn everyone going in to view it! Who knows what else we would have encountered if we had gone through with the other house they ""flipped""-looks like we dodged a major bullet."
RealEstate,3d95p8,awhq,2,Tue Jul 14 16:24:15 2015 UTC,"To be fair to the sellers I was working with, I truely don't think they know about the permit issue on the kitchen. So, it wasn't that they were hiding things from us, they just really didn't know. But, that's why pulling the permits is so important: the city keeps records that predate the current owner and can tell you things that even the seller doesn't know about the house."
RealEstate,3d95p8,wamazing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:09:29 2015 UTC,"Right, if someone truly doesn't know, that really sucks for them. These people either knew and hoped we wouldn't question it, or figured and chose ignorance over disclosure."

RealEstate,3d95p8,wamazing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:15:43 2015 UTC,"When interest rates go up, prices will drop. Perhaps not immediately, but if rates stay up for a month or two (and eventually IMO they will get back to 'normal' historical levels of 6-7% but this could take years...) it will start to impact prices. Because for every 1% rise, you take 10% of the potential buyers out of any given price point in the market. Because more of your payment goes to interest. So it's really a wash, if you're in the market, you can't afford as much house anymore but the prices of the houses you can afford will drop. So don't sweat that. In this regard, the longer you wait the better off you will be.   I'm not offended about not wanting to pay for an appraisal for a house you aren't going to buy! Lots of agents do inspections first for this reason, unless they have reason to think the house is overpriced and the appraisal might be the 'deal killer' instead of the inspection.   Unfortunately real estate is an industry where people are expected to have ethics and behave responsibly. And many participants won't do anything otherwise. But you find out what people are made of when some stress is involved, and I've seen a lot of agents whose ethics disappear when it becomes inconvenient. No one is REALLY watching out for you. Good luck."

The social media idea is a last resort when they try to stick you with the bill. She was OK lying to you and eating $350 to get you in a house you were not 100% sold on the risk of, so in my opinion she should be outted to others for those actions.

RealEstate,3d95p8,romerom,3,Tue Jul 14 19:59:01 2015 UTC,You have no obligation to pay for that. I can't believe your realtor had the gall to send it to you. Realtors take money out of their commission to pay for things like this all the time. There is nothing wrong with that. Where she made her mistake was leading you to believe that the seller was paying for it. By not being up front she did EXACTLY the opposite of what you wanted. You wanted the seller to pay for it and be reimbursed at closing. She made it to where you were going to pay for it either way. I would explain the situation to the SE and tell the them to contact the realtor for payment and if she says one thing protesting it I would go directly to her broker.
RealEstate,3d95p8,icantrange,3,Tue Jul 14 18:56:13 2015 UTC,You were smart to back out. Sadly sometimes you have to spend money on this stuff to get to the outcome.

RealEstate,3da1jp,JorgJorgJorg,2,Tue Jul 14 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"just wants to be done renting for good.   Aside from your seller's market, that's a pretty big reason to sell right there.  Any chance the tenants want to / can afford to buy the house?   Also, if you had them sign on another year, a potential buyer may see that as a plus... a turnkey rental complete with longstanding tenants.    Would having tenants signed on a lease be a problem in your area? Do you expect your buyers to want to live their themselves or do you anticipate more investors?  Obviously there is a lot I don't know about the situation, but I would just sign them on another year and tell them you're shopping for new owners but (at least in my state) the terms of their lease won't to change when the title changes hands."
RealEstate,3da1jp,wamazing,2,Tue Jul 14 18:01:32 2015 UTC,"Lots of things to figure out here, and, you didn't mention tax implilcations but that is something you might want to consider. Trying to time a market is always risky. I'd take that out of the equation and make your decision all the other points.   Great tenants are hard to find. If these people leave, you may not get as lucky.   Also consider that at some point the owner of this house is likely going to incur some large maintenance costs. Roofing, flooring, appliances, and mechanical systems can be expensive to fix or replace and things won't last forever. You don't say how old this house is but, consider what expenses will be in your future if you hang onto it. If you haven't been setting aside 10-20% of the rent into a reserve fund for these types of things, you might get an unfortunate surprise some day. So just food for thought."
RealEstate,3da1jp,Nalgene_Budz,2,Tue Jul 14 18:45:42 2015 UTC,"The house is about 50 years old. It has been very well maintained though. I put a new roof on last year with my son and his buddy. Saved an assload! New ac 5 years ago. Hardwood floors are in great shape. Replaced the stove, microwave, and dishwasher 4 years ago. The screened porch is degrading though. The old roof really leaked in there. Probably have to tear it off and rebuild or remove completely.   Something's could happen of course but I feel it's in pretty good shape at the moment in terms of maintenance."
RealEstate,3da03k,Gre8one7,5,Tue Jul 14 17:39:11 2015 UTC,"This isn't terribly a-typical. It all depends on the owner, I've seen this happen a couple of times with people I know. The seller isn't trying to rush you, he's just making a business decision, same as you. Based on what you said, selling the house is priority 1 for the seller and if he can't sell it soon, then a rental it shall be.  As for your offer, very few people on here will be able to tell you what you should offer without a lot more information including comps in your area, age of house, what kind of mortgage rate you can get, etc. These are things that your realtor should help you through.  You could potentially have your realtor inquire into the amount he plans to charge for rent. There's other potential complications, but you could potentially offer to sign a lease for renting the house with an option to buy at the end. You sound a bit nervous about the deal, so this would allow you to get used to the house and decide if you truly wanted to buy it outright at the end of the lease.  On a side note, you should line up your mortgage options before looking at properties. Give yourself the opportunity to pull the trigger quickly if you find a property that truly is going to get snatched up if you don't make an offer in an hurry.  Good luck!"

Racing motorcycles for a week (unless this is your vocation) can't be more important than buying a home.  It sounds like to me that if the seller can't get close to what he wants, then he will just rent the place out and keep it awhile longer.

RealEstate,3d9k31,-im_that_guy,5,Tue Jul 14 15:48:02 2015 UTC,It sounds like you could pick up the same sorts of deals from the MLS.  What is it about this deal that is making it attractive for you? The ability to pick them up 8 units in one go?  I think I would personally rather pick up an 8-unit multi if I could get one for the same price. Either way you'll need commercial financing so you might as well take care of a single building instead of 5 separate ones.
RealEstate,3d9k31,walterwhitmanwhite,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:16:15 2015 UTC,"I agree, however in my area it's difficult to find truly solid buys, the fair market value for most properties with financing pushes a mortgage that's too high for the rental prices. The other advantage to this particular deal is that because it's multiple properties I can get multiple loans instead of one commercial loan. Because I have experience with investment properties (but no commercial property) it's easier for me to get the regular investment loans.   Net: this bundle of properties isn't on the market yet (so I get dibs) and it's structured to make it easier for me to get loans. That combination makes it attractive to me. If the price were a little lower it'd be a slam dunk, but that's what negotiation is for!"
RealEstate,3d9k31,walterwhitmanwhite,2,Tue Jul 14 23:26:01 2015 UTC,Well if you get separate loans on them all you will pretty negate any benefit of buying them as a package.   Could you get a commercial blanket note on them all with a partial release clause allowing you to sell them off individually?
RealEstate,3d9k31,walterwhitmanwhite,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:04:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not very familiar with commercial loan procedures and policies. I'm virtually untested in that arena, and when I've looked at potential commercial buys in the past, the additional restrictions made it impossible for me to get approved for the loan. (last one I tried to get wanted me to have a 35% down payment for example)  I saw the separate loans as a significant benefit over a larger lump sum loan. I can potentially pay off individual loans to reduce my overall payment or sell off individual properties without getting tangled up. If there happens to be any snags with the financing I can potentially stagger the purchases over time as I acquire additional financing for the purchase.   If you have experience with commercial loans, or know of a good resource to reference, I'd love to hear any tips or tricks (or links!) you have. Thanks in advance!"
RealEstate,3d9k31,GringoGrande,2,Wed Jul 15 01:58:49 2015 UTC,"I hear you. Commercial loans are a pain. The trouble is that GSE-backed lenders will limit you to four mortgages.   A good middle ground might be to find a portfolio lender - that is, one that keeps its loans in-house and therefore doesn't have to worry about GSE restrictions. Maybe a local credit union or regional bank can do this."
RealEstate,3d9k31,GringoGrande,2,Wed Jul 15 11:12:36 2015 UTC,Very good advice. I think that's true for most investment properties when people are starting out. Portfolio and local lenders can certainly get a bit more creative in the way they lend the money!

If you have the cash and don't want the headache or hassle, their are companies that would be able to find you a property that will give you a good or decent return. Or you could travel to the location and use a local agent to find a property. There are many ways to go about it. It all depends on your current situation.  In regards to your question about the returns, I would check out Mashvisor. They will provide you with returns for vacation rentals.

RealEstate,3d7058,merreborn,5,Tue Jul 14 12:30:04 2015 UTC,The market is too competitive for that kind of exploitation.
RealEstate,3d7058,zardwiz,-1,Tue Jul 14 14:24:19 2015 UTC,"I was mostly being facetious, but I do think we're at a crossroads - we can either start paying people what they're worth (and this includes no longer replacing people with H1Bs who work for half the price) or we as a society can accept that FoxConn-style life may just find its way here.  It wouldn't be overnight, but we could swing that way without too hard of a push."
RealEstate,3d7058,merreborn,6,Tue Jul 14 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"we can either start paying people what they're worth   We're in a thread about the insane Bay Area real estate market.  The market is hot in part because many tech workers are well compensated.  But you're right that this is not universal -- some companies hire as cheap as possible.   we as a society can accept that FoxConn-style life may just find its way here   The cost of doing business is very high in California.  If you're minimizing costs to the extreme, you build your foxconn dorms in india or china, not california.  It'd only be economical to build such a thing in CA in the wake of a complete american economic collapse -- at which point we'd be welcoming the jobs."
RealEstate,3d7058,zardwiz,2,Tue Jul 14 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"I can't see CA ever welcoming a situation like that.  But there are certainly places in this country where people would take the jobs.  Hotshot programmers, maybe not.  The guys who fabricate chips?  Maybe.  Put the factory in MS or AL, run a class to teach them exactly what they need to know, bill them for the class out of their paychecks for the next x years, house them in company housing so they can afford the payments for the education, etc...  Parts of this country are not far away from being open to such a thing.  As a matter of fact, I can see my very own Governor Pence begging such a facility to come to Indiana, but that's neither here nor there."
RealEstate,3d7058,sousou43,12,Tue Jul 14 20:02:23 2015 UTC,"I live in the Bay Area and have been looking for a home for 9 months. I always knew it was going to be insane, but I never knew it would be this bad (originally from east coast). Lately I've been researching other markets outside of CA, and it seems that home prices in most metro areas are far outpacing wages // affordability. Is this true or is this just my perception?"
RealEstate,3d7058,squired,3,Tue Jul 14 04:00:34 2015 UTC,"It is in the hottest markets.  In my experience,  we are literally running out if room, so the old 3* wage metric no longer applies (in the hottest markets).  You can't build more condos/townhouses because of zoning and location, location, location.    So it filters out the buyers into those with alternative wealth streams.  Income don't always apply if the buyer also has income * x +  an equal portion in savings/investments/inheritance. The supply crunch is forcing people to dig into those reserves to live in the locations they want.   In the past,  those individuals would often decide to live in the location they wanted, then find a place they could ""enjoy"" without dipping into that nest egg.  Now however,  those savings are often raided for the down payment because it's the only way to live in the area desired,  in any house; and there are enough buyers with that option to outpace supply and fuel the market.   It's it sustainable? The run up probably isn't, but they also aren't likely to default and they are very likely to sit on property an awfully long time before dumping it.   It isn't that unusual to be honest save for the scale, there are areas in every major city that have always operated in that manner."
RealEstate,3d7058,adidasbdd,5,Tue Jul 14 06:29:46 2015 UTC,"BINGO. This market is out of whack. Financially irresponsible people/new money people only have money for so long...

You should always use cap rate to determine if you are making a good enough rate of return using the current market value of your property not your cost-basis.   For me, if the cap rate is well below the conservative market return of the S&P 500 (7-8%), I dump the property and keep the money in the market until a good opportunity yielding me 10%+ comes around."

Call, Call, Call, email, call again, write down names of people and get it in writing when the next payment will not include PMI.  Definitely don't just start short-paying it before they tell you it's not required."

RealEstate,3d9qp3,PhredPhnerd,3,Tue Jul 14 18:06:00 2015 UTC,"I did this last month. Very similar situation - actually, are you me?  All joking aside, given that the comps your realtor pulled really are for homes of very similar same size and features as yours, and there's no other outstanding factors (i.e. your house is on a court and backs up to a school playground/section 8 apartment/junkyard, while houses one street over do not have this same concern) - I say go for it.   Mine was due to the improvements I did to the house, as I had only had it for 6 months at the time  - It got appraised for far higher than I needed it to (I needed it to appraise at $250k, I expected it to come in around $270-275k, it came in at $292k) and I'm now sitting at 63% LTV. Having that $149 PMI fall off of my monthly payment felt pretty awesome.  Good luck!  edit: added numbers"

Are you planning on doing the work yourself, or contracting it out?  The 203k only works if you are contracting everything out, it doesn't allow for self help, but it does give you the money for the repairs/upgrades.  There is a local bank here that does self help construction loans where you can do some of the work yourself, but requires 15% down on the loan amount.  It is a portfolio loan product.  Your only other real option for the repair amount is to save up for it.  I am not really sure you are in a position to buy the fixer upper yet without more in savings.  If you tie the repair money into the loan, you might as well buy the 150k house, unless you have a real desire to have a fixer upper."
RealEstate,3daiic,landofmisfits,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:58:26 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I've never heard of the 203k loan.

RealEstate,3daiic,landofmisfits,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:20:39 2015 UTC,"While you are saving, do some checking into the 203k, it is an FHA product, 3.5% down of total loan.  There are additional fees for the FHA consultant and for draws and so forth.  If you are considering this it is well worth it  to find a loan officer that is extremely familiar with the 203k process as it is time consuming and can be a pain.  Finding an expert at the process will make it much, much easier all the way around.  Expect closing time frame to be in the 60+ time frame and for sellers to be a little less hesitant to accept it due to restrictions and time frame.  that being said, it is a very viable option for the right person and the right house."

Several years ago I listed a home that a murder/suicide occurred in over in Price Hill, lots of research on the requirements of disclosures for this and to me, things still were written rather ambiguously, at least what I could find.

RealEstate,3d9iyv,gaelorian,4,Tue Jul 14 16:08:52 2015 UTC,"the nuance on this one is it was private information that the broker had, and the client couldn't have easily obtained it, and the broker actively discussed disclosing it and chose not to.    //this is interesting because its a fringe case.  I think you are right, but I see the other side too on this one"
RealEstate,3d9iyv,madfer,3,Tue Jul 14 16:19:54 2015 UTC,"I was 100% in agreement with the sellers, until the part where the agents were being intentionally evasive about the neighbor.  If they didn't know, or did know and disclosed, this would be open and shut in my book.    I guess I look at it like a seller's disclosure.  If you don't know the basement is about to leak, fine.  If you know it's about to leak, and you disclose it, fine.  If you know it leaks, and you paint it all white to hide the damage 2 weeks before you list it, you're fucked."
RealEstate,3d9iyv,dorkella,6,Tue Jul 14 18:28:27 2015 UTC,"I don't really blame the seller.  I don't think they had to disclose.    There is pending litigation against the broker too.  I think they are more or less the ones that majorly screwed up here.  Whether the sellers wanted to disclose or not the broker should have done so IMO.  This is a pretty clear cut example of where being a dual agent makes stuff really bad for clients.  They acted very one sided to protect the seller because of what was probably a familiar relationship.  Who knows what they told the seller or what he told them, but this seems more a brokerage fuckup than a seller's IMO"

Probably a common way of doing it is where the tenant is responsible for paying, but in return is getting rent abatements or other offsets to soften that cost."

RealEstate,3d9o0g,NumNumLobster,3,Tue Jul 14 17:14:56 2015 UTC,Could you give a little more detail as to how you think the appraiser did not do his job?    Did the property not appraise for the sales price? Did the appraiser not inspect the property or file a report before the financing contingency expired?  Did the appraiser note conditions to be repaired or remediated prior to closing when you had hoped/agreed to complete them post-closing?    You need to narrow your complaint down a bit before we can advise about if there is anything you can do or not.
RealEstate,3d9o0g,letrinka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"My realtor is trying to investigate so I'm very short on info. In the email I got from my realtor being forward from buyer realtor saying realtor is ""uncomfortable appraising it."" see below of email  ""See messages below.   Appraiser would not appraise Carlos today ??  I will have to dig farther into this?!!! I was told by buyers agent that she heard that he did not feel comfortable w remodel work done ??!!!   People have been flipping homes and completing the work themselves for years.    I don't know if it was the electrical or???      To late tonight to reach anyone buy I will be on touch tomorrow.    K  Sent from my iPhone"
RealEstate,3d9o0g,letrinka,5,Tue Jul 14 16:31:06 2015 UTC,"Strange to me that the buyers' agent is in contact with the appraiser and not your agent.  In my market, my contact is the seller's agent who presumably has access to the property and is most familiar with the local market and the specific property features.  It sounds to me like the appraiser did do his job but did not feel that either the scope or quality of some of the remodeling work met the lender's underwriting guidelines.  Reading between the lines here, did you do some of the work yourself, perhaps the electrical work, and if so was it inspected and did it pass inspection?  Because while your agent is correct that people have been flipping homes and completing the work themselves for years, you still need to pull permits and have the final inspection signed off for certain parts of the project.    You also noted that some of the issues will be corrected by the buyers once they move in.  Usually, unless it is something very minor like replacing a patch of dead lawn or a cracked floor tile, the lender will want all issues corrected prior to closing.  This is especially true if your buyer is obtaining VA or FHA financing.  Sincerely hope this all works out for you."
RealEstate,3d9o0g,wamazing,2,Tue Jul 14 18:01:25 2015 UTC,"I did minor work like paint interior/exterior, and clean up. It did pass city inspection to have water and power on. The place has been remodel without permits from previous owner. Which I have no power over. We agreed to a price that was adjusted for issues that was brought up in the home inspection. also the buyer was doing conventional.."
RealEstate,3d9o0g,wamazing,3,Tue Jul 14 20:08:29 2015 UTC,"More details would be helpful. But an appraiser can decline a job for any reasons, you don't even need a reason.   If you get out to something and find out it's out of your toolbox, you'd be wise to spit the hook. If the property wasn't what you thought it should be, based on the order and the tax records, assessor records.   Some lenders have 'hard stops' on things and ask that if you run into that scenario on site, you stop work and call them. Even if I wasn't sure if something would cause a hard stop, if it was a good client I might call them and say, hey, this is an X, not a Y, you still want me to proceed? If the lender knows there is no way that loan will fly, they sometimes say yeah stop. Typical example of this is you get to a house and find out it's not stick built but a manufactured, and the lender doesn't handle MFGs.   The most likely thing I can think of is, either there are more units than are legal with the zoning. There are non-permitted additions (and/or, more units than are legal). Or major work that wasn't permitted but should have been according to local zoning.   I totally agree that people have been DIY'ing things without permits for years. The problem with this now is that GSEs have been grasping at any reason to force a buy-back, and non-permitted (illegal) things is a pretty good reason to say the appraiser and lender did not due sufficient due diligence and sold them an inflated loan. And indeed, something that has illegal improvements probably doesn't have the same market value (it might, but, probably doesn't).   Additionally many cities that are strapped for tax dollars have been cracking down on illegal improvements, and fining people. Insurance companies may not pay claims on illegal improvements. Many reasons why this no longer flies.   But without more details, I'm just guessing as to what possible explanations might be."
RealEstate,3d9o0g,wamazing,3,Tue Jul 14 18:34:18 2015 UTC,"I bought this property cash so there was no home inspection, trying to dig up records of permits or what not.

RealEstate,3d9l44,NumNumLobster,5,Tue Jul 14 16:05:07 2015 UTC,"Its a touchy subject.  I'd recommend taking a fair housing class if you can.  They take a couple hours.  The local BOR should do them (even for non members) as well as the local apartment association type groups.  They are typically cheap or even free.    It really all comes down to why you reject them.  If it is because they have a disability then yeah you have a problem.  Note the defense of something like this is a nightmare, which is why most landlords are overly cautious.    General good practices are to document your selection criteria, make it objective (ie make at least x, have x years of good land lord references, have a criminal history which meets this standard, credit of at least x) etc.  The first person that matches gets it.  If you can show through your other files you have been following that then it covers you from a lot of claims .    Just picture trying to defend that.  If it comes down to ""well I like the functional grad students better, they seemed more qualified"" when they are saying its because you didn't want to deal with disabled people (which I'll nicely note you don't seem to want to) then that is a lot harder than saying ""the disabled tenants failed to meet criteria x and y of our standards, which we have followed for all applicants and can document"".  You can good fair housing, ada and a few other terms to get more general info.    More or less though it is good practice to be able to demonstrate an objective reason for anyone that you deny, which you are also fairly applying to all applicants.    Note you don't have to work with this company if they impose additional burdens on you non ADA related.  If they want you to fill out a bunch of shit for them, do inspections etc, and let them guarantee the lease because these people don't have enough income?  You can say no to that.  You just can't outright say you don't want to rent to someone disabled.  You also are going to be required to make reasonable accommodations to the unit for them, which can be at their cost.  I don't really know what that would be for someone with mental issues, but the common examples are putting up grab bars upon request etc."

RealEstate,3d9l44,HarryWaters,3,Tue Jul 14 16:34:24 2015 UTC,"Well, honestly in this case I'd view it more as declining to work with the company than denying the specific individuals, since it's the company paying the rent.

I can refuse simply on the grounds I don't wish to work with Section 8 and be subject to their hoops and inspections. Also, I'd be more worried about the liability in doing the deal than turning it down. Is the company on the hook if one of these adults gets hurt or are you?"

At the time though my company had a blanket policy of not working with any placement agencies that required any correspondence with us so we informed them their current tenants could stay but we wouldn't let any new ones move in.

So if you take title as John Jacob Weisenheimer but your ID has your name as Jack, your signature will not be able to be notarized.

I'm guessing there will be a mechanism for you to set up the HOA without the developer. Or perhaps the attorney will get hold of him.  Why have only 20% of the lots been built on? Is it for the same reason that nobody can get hold of the developer? If so, and if you can figure out how to get the HOA set up, you might be able to pick up a few lots for cheap now and sell them on at a profit when they are buildable."

RealEstate,3d7jqw,patron_vectras,2,Tue Jul 14 14:20:06 2015 UTC,"this depends entirely on what the docs actually say and is exactly why it is important to have a legal professional review all covenants/deed restrictions/etc on a property before buying it.  Whether he wants to exercise his control here or not, he appears to have legal property rights over the entire subdivision.  Because he chose to move away, or whatever is probably not a valid reason for removing those rights.

I think the only ones that run into trouble are the ones that deal with race etc (the only white people can ever live in this house etc).  Even then, it isn't because the restriction itself is found to be unlawful, its that the court has determined it would itself be acting unconstitutionally to enforce something like that.

RealEstate,3d7jqw,wamazing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:53:03 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: Well, after speaking with some of the lot owners it seems that the rights expressed in the restrictive covenants have been assigned to a different guy, whom has been firmly entrenched in the town and community his entire life. He is a very wealthy owner of a lumber yard and a golf course, but does not actually own property in the subdivision. Which, tentatively could be a good thing, if he's reasonable. He might be able to be more impartial if he doesn't have an actual stake in the development. As for the HOA, it was never developed because about five years after the subdivision was established, the town annexed it and now pays for the street upkeep/lights, etc. I'm sort of surprised that none of the realtors who have listed these lots have this information. You'd think they'd be more on top of their game, since these changes happened 5-6 years ago. But, I guess not. Anyway, I've been given the contact info of the guy who has been assigned overview of these construction covenants and I'll now reach out to informally see if he would approve my house design. If so, I'll write a contingency into the purchase of any lot that my plans get preapproval, prior to closing. This is likely the best I can do to ensure I'll be able to build what I want to build."

These kinds of posts sadly enforce a systematic racist/classist attitude which is really quite sad. The Housing Choice Voucher Program is actually a miraculous success in terms of housing in this country. It has been shown to reduce crime rates, allow people to move out of poverty and provide quality housing to many many residents. The idea that Section 8 housing causes a neighborhood to be ""unsafe"" is quite frankly untrue. Are there bad tenants on the program? Yes. Are there landlords who are really slumlords? Yes. Does this mean that Section 8 is bad? No. Many neighborhoods actually witness an increase in property values when an HCV property comes into the neighborhood. Try to look at the actual problems in your neighborhood. Have you tried to talk to any of your neighbors? ""We are the only white people in the neighborhood"" could be interpreted as ""We're white and are afraid of talking to anyone who is black in the neighborhood."" Go out and talk to your neighbors. Find out who they are, what they do, etc and this process will go much smoother.

The numbers show that the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program actually lowers those numbers. Sounds to me like the neighborhood could do with some more Section 8 housing actually. Unless OP investigated each and every unit in the neighborhood with some government help, there's no way to know how many of those units are actually Section 8 as the program is designed to prevent the residents from being targeted for discrimination. Section 8 voucher are given out on a per unit basis. It is extremely rare to see an entire building with Section 8 housing. The idea of the program is to be an alternative to ""public housing."" Public housing concentrates poverty whereas Section 8 aims to disperse residents among the rest of the population, increasing integration in the community and favoring upward social mobility. Unfortunately, most people look at any neighborhood with a significant black and poor population and say ""oh must be Section 8."" as if Section 8 housing was a negative. The government sticks with the program because it works. Since the 80s they have been shifting funding from public housing to Section 8 housing because of the fact that Housing Choice Vouchers provide more bang for the buck and require no federal ownership of properties. Overall, the program is a success, but it is sadly seen through a negative lens based on false perceptions such as the one stated in the post that an entire neighborhood is Section 8 or that the residents are not good neighbors just because they're poor. Getting to know your neighbors is almost always a good idea. It could be a very few residents with unruly kids. OP might even find quite a few of the Section 8 grannies living in the neighborhood who are just as perplexed by the crime and crazy kids as they are."

RealEstate,3d48bn,LS6,3,Mon Jul 13 18:43:06 2015 UTC,"Well, the ""majority of the time"" our inspectors don't have all that much to say. Just another day of work in the field. Section 8 vouchers are usually pretty spread out, so I'm not sure what you mean by a Section 8 neighborhood. Most of the nicest neighborhoods have quite a few Section 8 units present as it gets the development companies a tax break. Often times, these neighborhoods that are full of problems are actually quite lacking in Section 8. Section 8 standards are uniform across the nation, so if the units are not maintained (which is what we check to see as a third party outsider) the owner will not get paid and the voucher will be removed. The most run down neighborhoods tend to be managed by landlords who do not get money from a Section 8 program, but rather choose to charge extremely low rates and are essentially slum lords. Perhaps the neighborhoods you're referring to are actually Public Housing projects? These would be quite different from a Section 8 property actually. One of our chief inspectors was actually conducting inspections on Section 8 properties in my hometown recently. A city official complained to him that Section 8 properties were a blight on the city and brought nothing but crime. Our inspector challenged the official to drive through a neighborhood with him and point out properties he thought were Section 8 financed. He picked out the nastiest and most run down properties. None of them had any Section 8 affiliation. The Section 8 homes were the ones with little flower flags hanging from the front porch with residents who were proud to have a place to live and assistance in paying their rent. As far as the landlords you know, it sounds to me like they don't know the rules of their program. If the tenant isn't paying up their nominal rent, he has very simple means of communicating that to the HA which manages his voucher and they can take action on it."

RealEstate,3d48bn,ctrealestateatty,31,Mon Jul 13 22:13:15 2015 UTC,"Boy, there's a lot of spinelessness in this thread. My first house was great deal on a house in the ""ghetto"", I was the only white person, but the neighborhood bordered a large university and a trendy gay neighborhood. All I had to do was wait for the students and gays to move in and my property value doubled. In the meantime I did everything I could do to get the neighborhood in order. It's surprisingly easy.  The first thing you have to do is tell yourself you're the baddest motherfucker in this neighborhood and you're not taking shit from anybody. The second thing you have to do is shed that white guilt and realize that 90% of the black families in the neighborhood want the same thing you do, they just don't know how to get there. Right now you're just seeing the fucking ghetto bravado from a very small percentage of the neighborhood, once you get those people out better people will move in.Spend as much time in your front yard as you can.  I worked in the front yard relentlessly, even if it didn’t need it. I planted flower gardens, weeded everything, overwatered, and then drank beer and smoked cigarettes on the front porch.  This accomplishes a few things, first it shows the whole neighborhood that a responsible adult who likes shit clean lives here and is keeping an eye on the neighborhood, second, it also allows you to meet neighbors, you have way more responsible neighbors than you think. third, it allows you to witness situations where you can CALL THE POLICE!  Fight outside? CALL THE POLICE! Hear gun shots? CALL THE POLICE!  That fucker looked at you weird? CALL THE POLICE! Domestic shouting match that you can hear? CALL THE POLICE!  No one in ghetto neighborhoods calls the police, do not assume that because your neighborhood sounds like Iraq, that the police are on their way.  Black people do not trust police and I don’t blame them, it’s up to you to call. I’d say I was responsible for the arrest of 20-30 shitheads over the three year period I lived there.  The neighborhood went from chaotic to peaceful.  All those ghetto motherfuckers walking around causing problems have warrants, all the police need is a reason to run their names to get them off the street and make your neighborhood nicer.  Bonus tip: in some states if a domestic disturbance is called in, one of the occupants HAS to go to jail, and they probably can’t post bond, so you’ll get a few months of quiet before they can come home to choke their girlfriend again.  Do not worry about retaliation, the police in my neighborhood would always ask if I wanted them to come to my house after they made an arrest about something I was calling about, I would just tell them no, plus no ghetto motherfucker goes after tax payers, they know that the police WILL solve that crime, but don’t really care about the drug dealer that got shot.  You didn’t think doubling you’re property value would be easy did you?  Now get out there and make that neighborhood a safe and healthy place to live."

If prices look to stay stagnant, or rise slowly, there is little reason to endure this torture. I've lived in rough areas as well, and the overall best policy was just to mind your own business, and talk to people normally.   Of course, I also reinforced my entire apartment, and kept my .40 loaded at all times. My downstairs neighbor would call the cops all the time on our adjacent section 8 apartment. Inevitably, the police would come around and ask her for a statement. She started getting dead rats placed on her doorstep (with the fucking throat slit). Neighbors would also intentionally talk loudly, saying things like, ""I wish that bitch would die"". She left immediatly after we did."

FHA security instruments require a borrower to establish bona fide occupancy in a home as the borrower’s principal residence within 60 days of signing the security instrument, with continued occupancy for at least one year.   http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=4155-1_4_secB.pdf"

RealEstate,3d48bn,thedaver13,4,Tue Jul 14 00:30:29 2015 UTC,"For someone young, ""profit"" in a house is largely an illusion.  For the near future, you will need somewhere to live.  Therefore any ""profit"" when you sell your home will be offset by the appreciation of your next home.  I am sure it appears your parents house is worth 4x what they paid for it.  However, how is that realized?  They still could only sell it and purchase a similar home.  Therefore, sell your house (x) and buy a new home (y).  Waiting 5 years for the house to be worth 1.1x, will be negated by having to pay 1.1y.  Or, put another way, you are only trading 5 years of appreciation on this home at the cost of 5 years of appreciation on the next home.    That being said, every home swap you execute results in a 6% commission and transitional fee loss.  However, that will occur either way.  You made a poor decision, it probably cost you 8%.  Take the haircut and move on."

RealEstate,3d48bn,acwshi,2,Mon Jul 13 22:41:14 2015 UTC,"Well, they failed, they legally cant say it's a bad area, but they can provide the crime data to you and let you decide if that makes it a bad area. 250 crimes in a year is pretty obviously not a safe, clean area.   This to me sounds like redfin (even if it wasn't.) This is the type of stories I have heard from inexperienced agents, that dont know the area they are working and selling.   My suggestion is to call your agent and tell them that you want to sell the home, and that they failed in representing and helping you find a safe home for you and your family and you would like a reduced fee for their incompetence. Speak with the broker."
RealEstate,3d48bn,WilliamMcCarty,2,Mon Jul 13 22:43:58 2015 UTC,I just got done working with Redfin and had an outstanding experience. You shouldn't make uninformed negative claims about an agency after someone explicitly states they didn't use that agency.
RealEstate,3d48bn,Boonpa,0,Mon Jul 13 23:57:44 2015 UTC,"Great, and when your transaction goes smoothly and the agent has to do absolutely nothing more than unlock the door (oh wait, they cant even do that because most are not members the local MLS that governs the key boxes). It typically ends in buyer frustration and REALTOR hate, because they chose the cheap route. Nobody wants to admit in a service business you pay for what you get.  Your anecdotal evidence doesn't change the fact the worst agents in real estate end up at Redfin, typically right before they go out of business.   Social phobia is real, and since the OP didn't state what agency they used, the fact that they still could have used Redfin is assumable, especially considering the agent was as bad as Redfin agents typically are. It would also make sense that when they went to see the house, the agent didn't say something in person, in confidentiality, because Redfin agents dont typically show homes, they use the listing agents to do their jobs..   Now can a bad agent work at Remax/C21 etc, sure. But that same agent will more than likely end up at Redfin before going out of business.  Either way, this is off topic of the issue the OP has."
RealEstate,3d48bn,WilliamMcCarty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:12:53 2015 UTC,"The agent didn't just 'fail' in representing her, they willfully breached their fiduciary duty to her by LYING about the crime rate and the enormous negative impact the adjacent sect 8 housing has on the then-current value of the house and it's future value. Use that agent again for a reduced fee? Huh? Rather, you should lawyer up and sue her! Any jury would sympathize with you and decide in your favor. The OP's 'what's done is done' fatalistic mentality is what allows lousy agents like her's to get away with this kind of predatory behavior.

Do your research on this and while your at it see if you fall under any of the exceptions to sell early. If that doesn't work then bite the bullet and wait it out for a year.

One person was killed by police in a shootout in an apartment across the street.  Other than that, it's just overgrown kids ""hanging out"" in the apartment grass and parking lot.

The key thing here is that they have to be run correctly.   Associations can take a lot of responsibility away from homeowners and that can be a desirable aspect of ownership. To be clear, any multiple unit property with any sort of guiding documentation is a homeowners association, and there are varying degrees of fees, amenities, and costs. Associations can consist of two units and a multi family and offer no amenities, charge $125/month for insurance, or they can range to cover dozens or a hundred units with amenities like pools, trash removal, snow plowing, landscaping, and exterior/common area maintenance.   In our offers, it's not uncommon to see a clause under the inspection portion stating: ""Subject to review of condominium documents."" In Massachusetts, the seller is responsible for known special assessments when selling (when the association decides to charge the unit owners an increased fee every month to cover a project like a new roof for example).   Depending on how the association is run, a healthy association applies a portion of each months HOA fee to reserve accounts in addition to the regular operating budgets. A well run association plans on large projects and maintenance well in advance and keeps its fees at a stable level. There is a complex in my market with a few hundred townhouses, and instead of ever charging special assessments, they budget roof replacements to a number of units each and every year. In my State, and I am assuming all of them, lenders are requiring that association allocate 10% of their budget to a capital reserve fund to ensure they have cash on hand in case or a large project/emergency. You will have to talk to your lender about the protocol because it's very common to find small associations with little or no reserves, and end up splitting costs based on percentage of ownership.   Two of my units are condos and I have never had increased monthly fees, and only one special assessment.   HOA in simple terms is a governing body that takes a lot of responsibility away from the homeowner in exchange for fees. It's extremely common and part of ownership. If you do not buy into that mindset, take a look at single family homes, but I wouldn't worry about compounding fees, I have seen some ridiculous fees, but not along the lines of increases every year.   Before you purchase, look at the master deed, rules and regulations, minutes of the meeting, and budgets to get an idea how business is conducted in any association. Purchasing a unit in a two family may consist of a budget written in crayon and a larger association with a full time management company can have pages upon pages of documents. Both are common."
RealEstate,3d6981,honesttennesseeagent,2,Tue Jul 14 01:33:28 2015 UTC,"The best way to mitigate your concerns if you do your due diligence regarding the HOA (talk to your potential neighbors and get their opinion on how it is run) is to GET INVOLVED. My last house was part of an HOA and I was continually amazed at how in a neighborhood of over 200 houses, only a dozen or so people went to the meetings regularly. Even if you don't join the board, you need to be there to know what they are thinking about doing and voice your opinion. Your home is a huge investment and the HOA has a lot of power over it. You need to know what going on."
RealEstate,3d6981,kegman83,3,Tue Jul 14 00:53:46 2015 UTC,Your HOA if like most HOA's in the country are made up of the homeowners who actually have properties there. One of the best ways to see what's going on and to have a voice in what goes on in your community is to show up to meetings and get involved. Maybe even run for a seat on the HOA. This is the best way to exercise some control in your own community and show some responsibility too.

However, it's also been a pain because we have a shared roof line and getting everyone to agree that, ""Yep, our roof needs to be replaced as it is out of warranty and leaking"" hasn't really happened.

RealEstate,3d6981,hahcha,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:46:02 2015 UTC,"Due Diligence helps. Talk to the board. If you can't get in touch with the board, try to get in touch with their lawyer. The annual reports and budgets are your best bet.   I also find that asking the neighbors (not renters, owners) is one of the most helpful ways to judge the situation with the HOA.  As an investor there have been plenty of times when I have been party to backyard meetings that shouldn't have happened, or votes that the community was not made aware of. The best thing to do is to befriend a member of the board and gather all the information you can. Not trying to scare you, but Most HOAs don't change, they are antiquated and it's a lot of BS.  Make sure you know the rules, ( if you can't park a pickup truck, who's responsible if a sprinkler breaks, what color paint are you expected to use on your home) and find out how the residents feel about them. Usually, this is a good indication if an HOA is going to be a pain in the ass.  Best of luck, Remember, they are just people."

If not, you might have a rude surprise for year two when your bill jumps up to reflect the actual usage.   If you take a look at the breakdown of the charges, you'll probably find the actual water charge is not much. My bill averages around $60/month and the water is like $10 of that. Everything else is fees, and that includes our garbage collection as well. So really may not be a big deal. Hopefully. If you really think you're getting screwed, find out if you can appeal this.

RealEstate,3d5sas,awfultrader,5,Mon Jul 13 19:16:53 2015 UTC,"If one of the bedrooms is a converted loft, you need to check to see if its conversion is permitted. It may not legally be able to be called a bedroom, therefore making a ""low"" appraisal completely justified. The seller will need to sell to a cash buyer or someone with a significantly higher down payment to make up for this decrease in market value due to the loss of a legal bedroom."
RealEstate,3d5sas,ky_ginger,4,Mon Jul 13 19:36:42 2015 UTC,"The owners never got a permit for the conversion. I believe legally they are calling it a bedroom because it has a closet (which I understand is the law in California). The one thing that doesn't worry me too much is that looking at the comps, there were about 20 condos that were sold in this neighborhood over the last year or so and nearly all of them are listed as 3 bedrooms. Many people in the community have converted the loft into a bedroom. Not sure if that will help."
RealEstate,3d5sas,wamazing,3,Mon Jul 13 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"Lenders (all types) have gotten pretty picky about requiring retroactive permits over the last few years, because they're had to buy back loans because of this. The credit union would be more likely to make an exception,  if they hold their own loans.   Another area where a lack of permits is problematic is insurance.  Check to see if this would be a problem on your homeowners insurance.  Say you had a fire that started in that area, they might refuse to pay the claim over that."

RealEstate,3d5sas,madfer,6,Mon Jul 13 20:29:14 2015 UTC,"The realtor is right. They are more conservative. A mortgage broker can do and will do A LOT more to get your business.  Credit Unions are also pretty un-competitive when it comes to rates and why people are so enthralled with them is beyond me. The last time I approached a credit union they were offering loans at 7+% when gettable loans through a broker were at 4.5%. Just saying that you need to make sure you're getting the best rate and not taking their word for it.  If you are getting the best rate/costs with the credit union then tell the realtor to stuff a sock in it. Keep in mind that appraisal's are independent these days. Banks have had to protect themselves better.  Also----appraisals are pretty cut and dry. If there is a bedroom claimed but it doesn't have a permit pulled then it's not a bedroom in the eyes of the appraiser. Same thing with a kitchen remodel or a bathroom remodel etc... The appraiser is going to count rooms and compare to what the city has on file with the possible exception of if the work was done a long time ago (think decades) and has been grandfathered in somehow. I know with my house I got a ""free"" room over the garage because they couldn't include it in the square footage as no permit was pulled, no property tax re-assessment, you get the idea."
RealEstate,3d5sas,1wf,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:20:03 2015 UTC,"What you say is true, but it makes me wonder why THESE mortgage brokers can't beat the credit union's deal on paper??"
RealEstate,3d5sas,adidasimwearing,3,Tue Jul 14 07:40:08 2015 UTC,If the appraisal comes in low both lenders will have the same problems and the same tools available to them.  Most likely the CU will have the most flexibility though.
RealEstate,3d5sas,1wf,9,Mon Jul 13 19:20:44 2015 UTC,"Most flexibility? No way. Credit unions do not compete. Credit unions offer home loans based on a tiered system of ""inventory loan capitol"". The powers that be running a particular credit union designated their total loanable amount of money into a stepped series of loans with each step being at a different loan rate. When they go through loans offered at the best rate then it automatically goes to the next step (higher rate). This protects them by insuring that they are not offering all of the loanable amount of money at a rock bottom price.  They can't offer great rates at a certain point because they don't have them to offer. A mortgage broker is of course cherry picking from everywhere at once and whose sole job is to get the deal funded by closing. A credit union will not bend over backwards to close on time.  Source: me-I've been buying commercial property for 20 years."
RealEstate,3d5sas,adidasimwearing,2,Mon Jul 13 22:28:36 2015 UTC,Thank you for the quick reply. Any reason why the credit union would have more flexibility? That's the opposite of what my agent has been telling me.

RealEstate,3d5sas,madfer,3,Mon Jul 13 19:39:31 2015 UTC,"I've bought a lot a property over the years and have to say that if an appraisal comes in WAY low then something is wrong. Either the appraiser is off or you are buying something that isn't worth what it's being sold at.   Today more than ever appraisals are very accurate. 20 years ago banks would send out a very young jr. bank officer with a clip board and a pencil and basically just confirm that the property existed. Pretty hilarious actually. If anyone objected, buyer/seller/broker, the bank would just be alright with it and the deal would go through. While appraisals are more accurate (independent appraisers) I seldom if ever hear about loans being cancelled due appraisals coming in low unless something dramatically is wrong. In fact it's been years now."

I just wanted to know if anyone has had success using this website."
RealEstate,3d5msk,GringoDan,3,Wed Jul 15 17:31:39 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about your experience. I don't mean to add insult to injury, but if you Google ""list on mls"" or similar you can see what MLS listings go for when you shop beyond the name brand. Ouch.  I'm experienced with FSBO sellers... Many of them miss the mark completely (though I think you are on the right track with MLS).   Here are a few quick points that the general public should know:   Buyer agents represent about 80% of the buyer pool, and they will plug buyer search criteria into the MLS, which sends automated e-mails to their buyers and themselves. In many cases it's that simple. MLS also syndicates to not one or two but hundreds of sites. It gets you on all the big name sites where independent buyers search as well as the brokerage websites. Many FSBOs refuse to offer a competitive commission to the buyer agent... But showing the property and considering an offer is free. Why turn away your potential best offer before even considering it? You can always counter. Elaborating on that further - No, the buyer doesn't pay their agent. It is traditionally split out of the seller's agent's traditional 5-6%. If you're saving on that, don't ask the buyer to pay, because your competition isn't.   Overall I see sellers go through a lot of creative and exhausting efforts to reinvent the wheel, and in my experience you are either on MLS or not. For this reason I recommend shopping around, and thinking critically about whether the traditional commissions are worth the value they were 20 years ago."

RealEstate,3d5msk,GringoDan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:36:58 2015 UTC,"For sure, it's not always transparent and there are plenty of options... First off, I have a trusted broker in CT that I refer listings to, feel free to PM me about it.  Testimonials are a good place to start, though of course anyone can post these.  See what kind of technology they are using to improve your experience... For example, many syndication sites like Realtor.com will only display the hosting brokerage phone number. Do they have a phone system in place to forward buyer calls directly to you, or are they manually receiving the calls?   Can you complete the setup process 100% online, or will you need to print, fax, etc?  Are other related services available (forms, escrow, etc.) which would make your overall transaction run smoother?  Related, under no circumstances should the hosting broker be intercepting buyer calls to gain a client... I've had a few customers tell me they've caught other brokers doing this.  The MLS exposure itself is in many ways the same among brokers, but there are little things that brokers can do to make the process smoother for everyone involved. (Not to mention politeness - goes a long way!).  Finally, find out if the broker services listings in their local market for some of the bigger names in the industry... This is a good indication that they are established and trusted.  Happy to help further..."
RealEstate,3d5msk,GringoDan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks. In my market, it seems as if I paid a few hundred dollar premium to list with FSBO.com rather than a local broker who would list on MLS for me.   Mistake made, but I don't imagine it to be detrimental. My mom's friends who are still agents think that using a local broker to do this is actually illegal in our state. Who knows the reality, either way, at least we're getting the listing out there in some regard.  My mom is a retired agent with 30 years experience. She advised me to offer 2% commission to buyer's agent. I think that's fair and fine.   I suppose I'm in the best position possible. I have 11 months before I need to sell, and even still, we could stay if we truly wanted to stay. I can move back with my mom at any time.

The idea of it being illegal sounds like misinformation from agents on the surface.   On the other hand, there are a few states with minimum service laws that force the flat fee model to behave more similarly to the traditional model (something I would consider anti-competitive and detrimental to the consumer, in favor of the traditional industry)."

RealEstate,3d58uw,AP310,2,Mon Jul 13 17:40:50 2015 UTC,"You will be about 6% RE commission locally.  Ask if there are any additional fees, some local companies charge a processing fee, but even some of the big ones don't, or the agent will cover it.  Ask what websites the listings filter to, some of the smaller companies don't have all the feeds that the larger ones do.  Find someone very familiar with your part of town, this part of Southwest Ohio can vary in value sometimes even street to street depending where the properties are located.  Look for a realtor that is responsive to your questions and has good turn around time on responding.  Ask what type of reporting and communication there is in regards to showings and feedback.  Locally there is currently a higher supply in the price ranges you are asking about than in higher price ranges, so you will likely have competition unlike the 200-250k price range, where supply is down."
RealEstate,3d58uw,landofmisfits,2,Mon Jul 13 18:56:21 2015 UTC,"How (and how often) will the property be advertised? Can you advertise the property in addition to the advertising the realtor does?  How long can the house remain on the market before you can sign a contract with a different realtor? Look at all of the things that keep a realtor actively engaged in selling your house and improve upon those conditions before you sign.  My limited experience with realtors has been that they spend less time and effort on selling my property than I'd like.  One realtor in particular didn't do any advertising for several weeks. I suspect she was trying to keep it ""under the radar"" so she could find a buyer and get commissions from the buyer as well as the seller.  I would have been happy to augment the advertising that her company did, but she had a fit and pointed out that the contract specified the company was responsible for all advertising.  Right before her contract was about to expire, she got really motivated and found a buyer!"
RealEstate,3d58uw,garflnarb,2,Mon Jul 13 21:55:05 2015 UTC,"Remember, the seller is in control.   I wouldn't advise you to negotiate the agent's commission to below the standard 5-6% otherwise they will get demotivated.  Everything is negotiable. Make sure you read your contracts. If you only want to give the agent 1 month to sell your property, you can do that!  When looking for an agent, try to find somebody who is knowledgeable and has closed houses that are similar to yours. You can find this by searching local firms or realtor.com. (Which, as a Director of Marketing at a luxury firm, I find to be the most accurate) look at their current listings, and past sales. And interview them as other people have suggested on this thread."
RealEstate,3d58uw,BeazyCO,2,Tue Jul 14 05:10:18 2015 UTC,"Look for someone who has been in the business full time for at least 2 years. Commission will vary from area to area, but the listing agent (your agent) should be able to discount his/her side of the commission for 2 listings. I would still offer the usual split to the buyer's agents."
RealEstate,3d58uw,madfer,2,Tue Jul 14 08:00:17 2015 UTC,"I'm linking the answer to this question (and others like it in an AMA I did Here) as well as pasting it below.  Make sure you talk with more than one agent, you are interviewing them to be hired for a job & you are the boss -make sure you do your homework on the applicants. Also, commissions typically vary by area & around here they are often 6%-7%, depending on what you need. Just keep in mind it's all negotiable & nothing is set.  That being said, here are some questions you can ask during your interviewing process:   Ask the agent if they do this full time or just on the side. In many markets (especially the past decade), things have been so volatile that many full-time agents (let alone, the part-timers) have a hard time keeping up. In my opinion, you don't want a part-timer managing your transaction -especially if they owe 40+ hours a week to their other boss. You want a dedicated, full-time agent on your side. Ask the agent when their last closing was. If they hesitate, or hemhaw on you, then it might have been a while. A starving agent is usually one to steer clear of... Ask them for references, there on the spot. If they can't give you at least 3 (and please, call them, do your due diligence as well), then you may want to steer clear. When you make an inquiry, pay attention to how long it takes them to respond. No agent should take more than 24 hours to respond to email/text/phone call. This world is too connected to have that excuse anymore. Ask friends & family for professionals that they've had a good experience with. Agents are people, and just like any other industry, there are fantastic ones and really, really shitty ones. Do your homework as well & don't be afraid to be your own advocate in the process."
RealEstate,3d58uw,ShinyLightning,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:01:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the advice.  I learned a few things from this.
RealEstate,3d5rns,jennybean42,3,Mon Jul 13 19:12:35 2015 UTC,Find out what the problem actually is and check back in.  The simplest solutions to why it would have been ok before and bad now would either be that either your husband or your inspector has a bad tester or one or the other doesn't know how to read it properly.  I honestly can't think of much else that would happen without intentional tampering with the breaker-box. There are just too many things that would have to happen to have every single outlet lose its ground.
RealEstate,3d5rns,sarcasticorange,2,Mon Jul 13 23:36:28 2015 UTC,"Half of them are wired reverse polarity, there is absolutely no strain relief at the junctions, and 3/4 of the outlets aren't grounded. My husband describes it as ""The electric was done by a homeowner with no idea what he was doing, or a an electrician with a drinking problem.""  My husband's uncle is an electrician and he worked for him for awhile in college, so I'm pretty confident he knows what he is doing. He didn't pay close attention to that part of the inspection because he was busy paying attention to the things he doesn't understand as well (like plumbing, roofing ,etc.) He figured that something this major would have at least appeared on the inspection.  That said, it isn't the end of the world for us, and it probably wouldn't have even been a deal breaker. But if we knew that there was this danger it would have been our #1 priority upon moving in, and we probably would have asked for some sort of concession.  I just can't believe that a competent home inspector didn't notice it at all and that that is okay."
RealEstate,3d5rns,sarcasticorange,2,Tue Jul 14 00:11:35 2015 UTC,"From your OP:   None of them are grounded   From above:   3/4 of the outlets aren't grounded.   Those are very different things, hence my earlier questions.  Many inspectors don't check every single outlet. He may have just gotten lucky and if you weren't paying close attention, it would be difficult to prove otherwise. As such, probably no relief. However, I would still just call the inspector (or their boss if they aren't the owner) and tell them about your experience. Explain that you are disappointed and would like at least a partial refund. He doesn't have to give it to you, but it doesn't hurt to ask and can only help him when it comes time for you to give him a review."
RealEstate,3d5rns,unfunkyufo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:26:32 2015 UTC,"My husband originally told me none of them were grounded, and when I asked him to clarify for this post (I know jack shit about this stuff) he admitted it was only 3/4.    But yes, thank you for your advice!"
RealEstate,3d5rns,ghostbuster12,3,Tue Jul 14 02:37:23 2015 UTC,"You should ask for your inspection money back.  My inspector didn't test a single outlet and of course nothing was grounded.  This, plus a bunch of other things he missed let me get back the $500 fee when I complained.  It's not great but better than nothing.  You have to sign away your right to sue in exchange."
RealEstate,3d5rns,IronMaiden45,3,Tue Jul 14 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"Inspector can't be liable for any missed defects - i know it sucks but you probably signed an agreement saying something of this sort. Check this to verify.  Also check your purchase and sale agreement with the seller, and see if they noted any defects with electrical. Then see if any work was done on the home recently and if any permits were pulled. If permits were pulled, this issue (most likely) would have been avoided. There is a chance you can go after the sellers, but you need a paper trail.  Other than that, it seems you're in luck since your hubbie knows electrical. Might be best to fix the defects and learn from this mistake. Better to have less stress."
RealEstate,3d5rns,madfer,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:21:45 2015 UTC,"I would recommend asking your realtor. Since you already closed on the house, I highly doubt you will be able to get much without having to spend money on a lawyer. You can try and establish that the previous owner had knowledge of the problem beforehand, but obviously that can be extremely difficult to prove. Also, you can ask the inspector about what points he has to go through to make the inspection. If you can prove that he didn't fulfill his duty, then you may be able to work out a deal and get another inspection done or a refund. Otherwise, the overall mantra for real estate is ""buyer beware"", so I would just get that grounded asap."
RealEstate,3d6afy,rocket_lady,3,Mon Jul 13 21:23:24 2015 UTC,"I underwrite them. Usually it's around 300-350K you see a problem. I've done plenty of them in the 250-330 range though. We're looking at household income and usually for families with 4 or less, it's around 100K. In my experience, if one person makes $90K, it qualifies. Trouble starts when you have two people making 45-50K because if one had a nice bonus this year or the other got a little raise, that's where things get hairy. Look over the commitment you get for signs we're still looking at DTI (debt to income) or anything about paystubs, W2's, bonus, OT. I've had deals be in process for months, get an updated paystub showing a raise, and boom it's dead. Again I've done lots in the higher bracket, and when the borrower are over the limit, in almost every case it gets flipped to FHA 3.5% down using the same appraisal and still closes."

RealEstate,3d6afy,underwriter1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:06:48 2015 UTC,"It is more nitpicky to meet HUD guidelines than conventional financing, but it revolved around things affecting health and safety. Its the appraiser not the inspector who would make an issue out of it. I would say probably 1 or 2 in 20 files come back with an issue. In New England we have an older housing stock so typically there's more issues that don't meet HUD guidelines. Most common issue is peeling paint on houses built before 1978 (paint chips may contain lead). But otherwise it's not too bad. They're really looking for health and safety issues. You just see a little peeling paint. They see a child eating lead paint chips."

RealEstate,3d4fop,WallHalen,3,Mon Jul 13 15:03:16 2015 UTC,Go with your gut.  My wife and I bought a house in April of '14 pretty close to our old house.  We closed on Friday morning and the sellers said that they might need until Noon to get all of the stuff out... they had two moving crews and were obviously trying as hard as they could to get it done.  We had arrangements made to move in that weekend...  It drug out all day... we didn't get to start moving in until 7PM that night.  I had our agent talk to the seller and mention that it put us behind schedule.  The seller wrote us a $500 check on the spot and asked if there was anything else he could do for us... we were pleased with the outcome and everything worked out fine.  Do what you think you should do... nobody here can interpret the sellers motive like you can.    Good luck.
RealEstate,3d4fop,ImJustAGirl14,7,Mon Jul 13 15:41:44 2015 UTC,"DON'T DO IT!!!!  After closing, you have virtually no leverage against them if they decide 1) not to move on time or 2) to leave the place trashed.  I've made the mistake of doing this twice and both times it turned out to be a huge headache. The first time they left the house filled with crap that I had to hire someone to clean out. The second time the woman just decided to linger there for days after her move-out date. I had tenants scheduled to move in shortly after closing and I ended up having to give up their lease and pay her (even more than I already had to BUY the house) to give up the keys and finally leave.  DON'T DO IT!!!"
RealEstate,3d4fop,NeeNee9,3,Mon Jul 13 13:45:04 2015 UTC,"It's ok to let them stay a couple days after closing.  Have an amendment written for ""occupancy after closing"". This says they will continue with their homeowners insurance and will not damage the house. I only charge rent (the mortgage payment divided by 30) after day 3.  The reason they are probably doing this is because they need the proceeds from selling the house to buy their new one."
RealEstate,3d4fop,landofmisfits,2,Mon Jul 13 13:25:29 2015 UTC,"This seems like the best route without seeming like a dick. They have been pleasant to work with so far, but I don't want to do anything that would push buttons. The ""occupancy after closing"" I have read other places and like this a lot. I have already specified I want their insurance to cover those three days and adding they will have to pay everyday after the three days is a nice way of saying 'stick to your word'."

Not to mention it was filthy."
RealEstate,3d4fop,bluejeenbaby,3,Mon Jul 13 14:50:31 2015 UTC,"I did this when I sold my house 18 months ago. Like others had mentioned, it was because we needed the profit from selling the old house to close on the new house. We paid them 1/30th of the mortgage and interest per day, kept it insured, and kept a ""security deposit"" of a few thousand in escrow that we got back after we signed off that we were out and nothing was damaged. I think it's pretty standard to do, and it worked out well for us."

RealEstate,3d4fop,dontdonk,2,Mon Jul 13 21:02:25 2015 UTC,What did your contract say? Usually is once you close the seller have their stuff all moved out and ready to give you keys so you can move in. I wouldn't do it because it will lead to problems if they don't get their stuff out in 3 days.

It was a short sale that turned into conventional when we offered significantly higher over asking price - so instead of having 4 months + to move out while the short sale was processed, sellers ended up having weeks. We were buying it as an investment property so had plans to gut the kitchen and baths and do significant improvements in the entire house, so yeah it still had risk to it, but less than a traditional owner occupant purchase in a non-distressed sale situation.  We were also buying the house ""as-is"" and told the sellers that they could leave whatever they wanted, they didn't have to empty the house. The benefits of our offer, combined with the fact that they were finally free and clear of their financial troubles as a result of our high offer, gave us all of the cards in the deal and made it very difficult for them to not hold up their end for fear of the deal falling through.   Now, I definitely wouldn't do this in every situation - just telling you how we've handled this scenario in the past."

I was kinda skeptical due to the fact if they injured themselves after closing I would be held liable since the property was now in my name, but I figured what the heck.    It ended up working out though and they were gone the next day. On the plus side, there was a mixup with one of the utility companies and because the previous owner was still there moving, I was able to get the issue resolved with them.    Now if they had still had stuff inside the house, that would've been a different story. In my mind, there's too much that could've gone wrong had that been the case."

RealEstate,3d4fop,Esquire99,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:46:54 2015 UTC,Tough question.  If someone is waiting to move into your home it can be a real problem trying to delay the close after the fact.  I have had clients refuse to move until the deal is closed (plus a few days to move out) because the felt they might incur moving costs and then find out the buyer didn't perform.  There can potentially be four families all waiting on the final resolution.  I believe each situation is unique and you need to take all sides into consideration.
RealEstate,3d68uj,adesimo1,3,Mon Jul 13 21:12:13 2015 UTC,"I would recommend that you stick to your current job and start investing in rental properties as a side job. The goal is to make enough profit to cover the costs of the property such as the mortgage payment, taxes and insurance.   You don't need to be an experienced investor with deep pockets to make money in real estate. In fact, some of the most successful investors started out with small and simple portfolios. How invested you become depends on your long term strategy and the amount of time and money you are willing to commit. Those who have acquired an in-depth knowledge have become effective real estate investors and generate positive cash flow to buy more properties.   Understand the investment process before starting the search property. There are numerous variables to learn such as valuation and understanding the demands of being a landlord. Finding, valuing and researching properties is simple but not easy, you could find yourself at a loss if you don’t understand the basics of real estate investments. Once you understand the basics, investing can be a simple practice. Mashvisor has put together tools for finding and valuing real estate investing to make the basics easier to grasp."

I've been researching investing for several years now. I actually planned on making my first MFR deal in 2014, but my unhappiness in my career led me to put it off so that I would have a financial cushion for a career change.

RealEstate,3d68uj,dsmdylan,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:07:57 2015 UTC,I'll consider that. The main reason I was interested in something in the RE field was for the exposure. If I move to the market(s) I'm interested in and immerse myself I feel like I'd have a better chance of being in the right place at the right time to snap up any great deals.  I'd also be in a slightly better position to network with others in the RE field which would hopefully lead to other deals/partnerships as well.  But if consensus ends up pointing me away from RE then I might prioritize that field lower on my list.

There are a few options but the best option will vary depending on a lot of different factors.   1) You could consider being a full-time real estate agent if you stick around your current job for at least 6 months. You could get your license and work a few months part-time as an agent to be able to get some traction to close a few deals.   Some factors to consider: How is the real estate market in your location? Is there enough of a demand where you be able to make money as an agent in your location? Will you be happy being an agent? It's one of the hardest jobs out there and for most, not the most enjoyable.   2) Find another full-time job (even if you might not enjoy it) and put together a smart investment strategy to do on the side. Make it a top priority to be a full-time real estate investor. Basically, it will be you starting your own business as part time until you are able to do it full-time so prepare yourself for the tough entrepreneurial lifestyle."

RealEstate,3d68uj,BeazyCO,2,Tue Jul 14 03:25:59 2015 UTC,"Sadly no: I'm a small-time landlord who self-manages. But I have encountered both good and bad property managers. I also know REITs have expanded their operations significantly in the last few years, and need people with this expertise.   My sense is to be a good PM, you need to be good with details, good at contracts, and know the ins and outs of screening tenants, minimizing vacancy and keeping properties cash-flow positive. You need to know how to fix things cheaply and well. Ideally, you should be able to fix most simple handyman-type problems (replacing lightbulbs, toilets, leaky faucets, small drywall and paint fixes) and know who to call for more serious problems (plumber, electrician, roofer, etc.).   As for who is hiring -- I have no idea. You might want to look into www.biggerpockets.com and ask around on that forum, i.e. how to train as a property manager and whether local REITs are interested in a manager for your area."
RealEstate,3d4qsv,Rocksteady2R,3,Mon Jul 13 14:46:23 2015 UTC,"If you haven't gotten this information yet, ask your realtor to look up all utility prices or do it yourself.   Don't stop looking at other homes (at least online if not in person). If this one falls through it's nice to know what else is available and what other prices houses in the area are being listed at. (We were under contract, lost the house due to a super low appraisal, and had to jump back into looking at houses and I wished I'd continued to keep an eye on houses.)   Lastly, push for that appraisal to be done asap. If you're doing an FHA loan it's great to get the list of items the appraiser requires to be fixed at the same time you're receiving the home inspection so you can gauge what fixes you want the seller to undertake. Also, due to the housing market right now (at least in my area) appraisals are taking a long time. Best to get it scheduled asap."

Probably the biggest thing would be to work with your loan officer to find out what documents your lender will need and get those ready to go asap. Respond quickly to any additional requests your lender may have and verify they receive things you send them. Staying on your lender is probably your biggest job between now and closing.  Be sure you don't make any financial changes during the loan period if at all possible. Don't do anything that requires a credit check. Don't deposit any financial gifts and be ready to explain any that you have received.  As soon as the inspection comes in, work with your agent to put together your repair request as soon as possible or schedule any specialized inspections that may be needed as follow-up to inspection results.  Other than that, just stay in touch with your agent and ask them for regular status updates and know all of the steps and the target dates for each one.

When I was working in apartments, I took that seriously. Somebody shows up in the office and says ""Hi, I'm a friend of Bob, what's his apartment number?"" I say ""Why don't you use my office phone to call Bob?"" Yeah, this was before cell phones were everywhere. I would get rental verification requests all the time. And unless it's got your signature on it or I have your written notice, all I would say is ""They have not given me any notice."" By giving notice, you are giving permission for your new landlord to verify your current rental status. You are also indicating that you intend to follow the notice requirements of your current (and possibly future) lease. Unless your new landlord can verify that you pay rent on time and aren't likely to skip out, you're not getting a lease to sign.  TLDR: yes, totally normal.  Hope this was helpful."

Go to Allied Schools website or Kaplan, there's no shortage of schools online. You get the books, usually Real Estate Practice, Principals and Legal Aspects. Register on the web site. Read the books, take the online test. They're online, so open book, it's nearly impossible to fail.  Once you have that done you register for the state exam. Here's the tricky part. Take a refresher course a couple days before the state exam. What you read in the book will be on the test, mostly. Lot of it won't be. Some of the stuff on the state exam will be stuff you've never heard of. The refresher course will give you hints, pointers, a good overview of what the actual state exam is like. Take the state exam. You might fail. About half of first timers fail. No big. Take it again. You'll pass.  You'll begin to get dozens of letters and postcards in the mail from brokers. (if you're unfamiliar with it, what people typically call a real estate ""agency"" is what we in the business know as a ""broker."" Keller Williams is a broker. Dilbeck is a broker. You get the idea.) All those letters and postcards will say come and work for us! Unless you know exactly where you want to go, interview several of them.   And this is important. It's not a typical job interview. You're interviewing them. What kind of training do they provide? How is the mentorship program? How do they supply leads? You'll learn more questions to ask as you go on.   When you settle on one you like, that feels like a good fit, tell them you're ready to sign. You become an independent contractor at that broker.   At this point, you immediately forget everything you learned to get your license. Almost none of it applies to actually doing the job. Now, it's all about prospecting. Making calls. Sending letters. Knocking on doors. Doing open houses. Showing properties for other agents. Trying to find clients. If you're working full time, kiss your evenings and weekends goodbye. Just part of what has to happen. If you can afford at least 6 months worth of living expenses, then great, go whole hog and do it real estate full time. Use your ""sphere of influence"" (fancyspeak for ""everyone you know"") to expand your business. Hand our cards, make sure they all know you're a realtor, do anything and everything you can do get your name out there and make people aware of your new job. You'll get buyers, you'll get sellers and if you don't screw them about you'll get referrals. 90% of the business comes from referrals. As a new agent, don't turn down anybody, buyer or seller. They only have $200K to buy a place? That's fine. You work hard to find them that place, couple years from now they'll be $400K sellers and who you think they're going to call? That's right, the guy who would help them when no one else would.   That's the basics. It's a lot of work but it can be rewarding and enjoyable. I'm in it less than a year, just got my first listing while I work a full time job. I look forward to the day I can effectively be my own boss and make my own schedule. Not there yet but this first listing happens to be nearly a million dollar listing so...there's hope.  Good luck."

You'd have to look at your lease and the local laws to know for sure. You can try to reach an accommodation with them, and that's going to obviously include some kind of financial consideration for their time and discomfort during the reno process.

So, doesn't leave much choice but to wait until their leases are up to bump up the rent (make sure to give proper notices under the current lease). If they stay, don't bother renovating.

Talk to your tenants and see if they would be willing to live through it, possibly for a slight reduction in rent for the months they are inconvenienced. Having rent coming in while you are doing a reno is usually better than having the place sit empty while you are working on it.  Once their lease comes due, raise the rent to current market value stating the improvements you've made.

It is very difficult to time these things right; you may sell, rent at inflated price and wait for awhile to buy again. Renting short-term then becomes long-term and prices of homes in the market may never drop to when the market was cold or even the current level.    For a primary residence, I hate looking at the property as an investment. That is me though."
RealEstate,3d4exj,lord_dumbello,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:35:35 2015 UTC,Have a real estate agent set you up on an automatic search in their MLS to send you all recent data that you are interested in.  They should be able to set it up so it continues to send you any new sales as well.
RealEstate,3d4exj,madfer,2,Mon Jul 13 16:08:45 2015 UTC,"In addition to all the other good responses here, I have just two points to add:   It's basically impossible to ""time"" the market, just like it is on the stock market. You can always get lucky, but unless you have some insider information you're better off not trying to time to market. You could very well sell only to have the housing prices in your neighborhood continue to increase even more over the next few years. With regards to interest rates. It's likely (probably very likely) that interest rates will go up in the next few years. However, this doesn't happen in a vacuum. When the return on an asset goes up (higher interest rates) prices prices generally will go down (overall, not necessarily in the neighborhood where you live or might want to live). So if you're thinking about selling, renting for awhile and then buying you might get lucky and see lower prices in a few years (again, see point 1) but it's also likely you will face higher mortgage rates.   That's my two cents worth. As others have said here, you should focus on doing what you need for your family, rather than trying to make a little extra profit. If you need a larger house, now is a great time to buy. If you don't need a larger house, maybe hang on to your current house for awhile longer until you do. In my opinion it's very likely that the cost of TRYING to time the market (the cost of moving two extra times, once into an apartment and then out of the apartment) probably outweighs any gains you would make by timing the market. Plus there's always the chance you could time it wrong. Are you comfortable with the risk of selling now and moving into a rental only to find significantly higher home prices a few years down the road (meaning you could have sold for more and now you have to pay more to get back in)."

When you speak to a loan officer, be explicit in stating you will need a deed prepared, with your wife conveying her interest to you, as your sole and separate. Depending on the state, if the deed calls out your marital status, without sole and separate language, she may still have some rights to the property.

Having done multiple evictions in Michigan, I can tell you the laws are very tenant friendly.  This man was given multiple warnings and ample time to vacate the property.

Talk to the neighbors, either of houses we already own and are working on, or on houses we're scouting. We have two that we've gotten leads on this way that we are actively pursuing, and have talked to the owners about selling. For us - if we purchase homes privately, we have more margin to work with, and theoretically therefore more potential profit. That doesn't necessarily apply to you though.   What does hold true, whether it's for investment purposes or for personal occupancy: The 60+ set are much more likely to talk and be neighborhood gossips - you'll be surprised what you can find out if you're willing to listen. Be polite, introduce yourself, say you and your SO love the neighborhood and would love to live and raise your family here long-term, but have been having trouble finding one for sale that fits your needs - and just let them talk. Trust me, after a few of these you'll get leads. Bonus points if you are neatly dressed and you're walking a kid in a stroller, or a (well-behaved) dog on a leash, and look like you would be good additions to the neighborhood.

RealEstate,3d4dq8,one-hour-photo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:13:07 2015 UTC,"Caveat Emptor. Keep this phrase in mind.  When purchasing a property you are making an investment. A large one. You need to take care so that you don't set yourself up for regret, or worse, failure.  To not fail, is to purchase a property that not only will hold it's value, (or increases in value), but is also consistently (or below-market) priced for the area (ask your agent for the current and past sales for the area), and most importantly has to be a great property that will work for your family.   Secondly, speaking as a seasoned property consultant, while saving money is a concern, it shouldn't necessarily be your main concern. Many times, buyers looking on sites like Zillow and Trulia often create misguided expectations for themselves. It's very easy to find the cheapest,nicest home on a website, but when it comes to your specific area/ or specifications, you may have some trouble.(Supply and demand) On Zillow, a $400,000, 3 bedroom in a beautiful area will stay on the site for up to a month after it's sold, when in reality it sold in 2 days.  When your agent shows you some properties, make sure he did his homework, and give yourself some ample room. Usually, a $75,000 leeway is acceptable when talking about the $300-500 price range.

RealEstate,3d199q,DictatorKris,29,Sun Jul 12 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"Super ugh here.   I'd start with the local planning and zoning department. Find out if what they did was even legal. The last thing you want to do is inherit someone else's legal problems. They are the ones who are going to enforce any laws regarding construction or demolition in your area. Ask about the various fees to apply for permits if you want to do this. Google demolition contractors in your area and see if they would give you a quote. I think you'd be wise to do environmental testing, that may be up to you unless your lender requires it.   The big problem I see with this, right away is, your lender will probably require this to be two separate loans. That means two down payments, two appraisals etc. If you are using a local lender who does portfolio loans, that might be different but for typical GSE financing these are going to be two different transactions.   You may get a lot of pressure from the people involved in selling and financing this to call the sales price for the house X and throw in the lot for free. Say the house is $100K and the lot $25K, they will want to sell you the house for $125 and deed you the lot separately for free. This is not going to fly for GSE financing. In fact it is mortgage fraud if the house by itself if only worth $100K.   But be careful because that lot may actually have a negative cost if the remediation turns out to be troublesome. Good luck."

There is real demand from individuals (such as yourself), there is demand from international buyers, the inventory is lower than average in most of the 20 cities surveyed in Case schiller, permits aren't being issued as quickly in some cities as they were in the early 00's, oh and the motherfucking ace in the hole? The housing crash we just had in 07-08.   How could that be an ace? Do you think that the FRB, and every other meaningful financial governing body that slashed rates, pumped trillions, and supported assets to no end would just let go so they could step back 5-10 years later and let it all come crashing down again? No, housing (and poor lending standards) started the crisis and they will have their eyes on it like a hawk.  Face it, you're in LA houses are very desirable the economy is vibrant, the weather is nice, the food is okay; they are also desirable in SF, NYC, Tokyo, Ontario, Berlin, London etc... all areas with strong local economies and worldwide draw.

RealEstate,3d1x4m,wamazing,7,Mon Jul 13 15:57:57 2015 UTC,"I don't really know much about LA market but there are some principles underlying real estate markets that hold true pretty much everywhere. Cali can be a little different because of the property tax situation. But not that far off base as to make what I'm going to say meaningless. It's just one data point to look at, take it FWIW.   There are 3 ways to estimate a value on a house. In a balanced market, all 3 should be (roughly) equivalent assuming your analysis is correct. First is, how much does a similar house cost? 2nd, how much income does it generate? And 3rd, the cost to construct a similar house new (allowing for depreciation). Because those are your options if you need a place to live, buy, rent, or build.   When those 3 values are way out of whack, that's (IMO) pretty good evidence of a bubble. Now I know California is always out of whack to a degree because of the tax situation. When I was considering a job offer in LA I found it very interesting that I could rent a nice place for about the same cost as a place in Phoenix, but to buy was roughly 4 times as much. And that wasn't in a bubble.   I frequently espouse that anyone who is an active participant in a real estate market (or who wants to be) should invest some time watching the market. When sales prices jump but rents stay the same, that's a SIGN. One sign, as I mentioned earlier. If the market was truly growing based on job expansion, population expansion, wealth expansion, rents would go up in line with sales prices. And costs to build would also rise as the underlying land jumps up.   I don't know enough about LA to say if rents have risen 20% like sales prices have, I'm not watching that market. But maybe something to look at, when you're deciding if now is a good time to buy a place or not."
RealEstate,3d1x4m,Daforce1,6,Sun Jul 12 22:47:33 2015 UTC,Good points but I would also argue from a residential perspective that value/cost as a percent of income makes sense. If you look across the US San Francisco is the only city majorly out of whack. It requires an income far above average to purchase an average priced home. Even in NYC it is close to aligned.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/08/map-the-salary-you-need-to-buy-a-home-in-27-u-s-cities/

But I'm pretty sure (from being on the periphery of this) that whenever anyone is in possession of your personal financial information they must comply with Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. And they must share details of their compliance with you. (Hence all those annoying privacy disclosures you get in the mail from financial companies). Is your realtor collecting this information in compliance with those laws?   If you want to be a smartass, tell them you will hand over your tax return once you've seen their disclosures stating how they comply with those acts. If you get deer in the headlights from them, I'd seriously find another agent.   Boundaries are a good idea in business as well as personal relationships and this person is overstepping.

As others have said, they are probably trying to make sure you are really qualified to buy a home before they spend their time showing you around, but wanting to see your tax returns seems like a very fishy way of doing that.  Have you gotten preapproved by a lender yet?"
RealEstate,3d0b39,TOMtheCONSIGLIERE,6,Sun Jul 12 17:14:38 2015 UTC,"The short answer is NO. They have no right to see any of that information. They may ask for it but they don't have the right to see it. They CAN however refuse to show you apartments because of that. In a market like NYC, perhaps the broker doesn't want to waste time showing certain apartments where you couldn't get board approval or afford.    Some brokers just want to see your financials before they give any effort."

Some of the big banks are known to issue a preapproval letter based on a 2 minute phone conversation (ie, worthless), whereas many of us local direct lenders want tax returns, paystubs, a bunch of other stuff, and 2 hour conversation with you.  Her intent may be to run them past a lender she knows to be competent, to ensure she isn't wasting her time.  What everyone else is saying about her 'right' to 'demand' this or that is correct, but the above hypothesis may be why she is asking for it."

Pull reports from trend?  I'm must be a computer genius because boy was that easy."
RealEstate,3d0b39,TheWorldMayEnd,6,Sun Jul 12 19:23:12 2015 UTC,For starters if an agent indicates they are fine being jerked around they probably have little experience or an abundance of free time .  Do what you want.  If you want good representation you won't find it with your attitude.
RealEstate,3d0b39,NumNumLobster,-2,Sun Jul 12 19:30:03 2015 UTC,"What is good representation, that is my point.  I've yet to see an agent that wasn't anything other than a burden and a nuisance.  My ideal transaction.  I deal direction with the seller, barring that I deal directly with their agent.  Cut out all this whisper down the lane BS.  What value do you add to the transaction?

RealEstate,3d0b39,MsTerious1,3,Sun Jul 12 19:42:53 2015 UTC,and about to ride a camel.   Added to my list of essential qualifications when selecting an agent
RealEstate,3d0b39,NumNumLobster,2,Sun Jul 12 20:06:40 2015 UTC,"hahahahah....   This just keeps getting better. Yep, that is ALL agents do. Please do not ever contact another one because you got this!!   But seriously, because I assume there are some people who have more common sense, I will answer this question....   Representation's value to a home buyer / seller:   Maximizing their deal for them. If I am a good agent, I can help negotiations turn out more in your favor than they would without me. For example, just recently, a seller counter-offered a price that was $5k higher than my buyer offered on a small $60k property. My buyer planned to accept it (as he would have if he'd dealt directly with the seller). I was able to convince him to not accept it and instead, I provided information to the seller that got the seller to agree to my buyer's price - nearly a 10% difference. When I work for a seller, I work to get more for them, too. I save you time. Yes, you have to hire some inspectors, but I pull court records, city ordinances, covenants & restrictions, surveys, past property records, and much more in order to make sure you can use the property the way you want to and don't have ugly surprises after closing. I provide a second set of eyes so that when you see something like ""Southwest quarter of Southwest quarter  and West Half of Southeast quarter of Southwest quarter (W½ SE¼ SW¼) of S12 T12N R34W containing fifteen acres of land, more or less"" you'll know you're getting what you think you are getting and not something two neighborhoods away.  Or to handle the problems that can arise with lenders who want road maintenance agreements or party wall contracts or who can only make the loan if you can prove you paid off that judgment ten years ago that's still showing on your credit history.  Protection. Making sure the buyer and seller have documentation that will help keep them from having misunderstandings and lawsuits later on. In fact, because I represented one of the parties, the odds are that any lawsuit will come after me INSTEAD of my client. That's pretty nice to have that protection.  While we are not able to provide advice in areas in which we are not trained, after attending hundreds of inspections we can provide insight on property conditions and market conditions that might not be evident, such as when an area is prone to sewer line problems or foundations shifting or an airport's going to be built right behind the house or a military base may be closing - things you'll want to research more but that you might never have considered researching if we hadn't clued you in. Oh, and then there's the SAVING money from inspections when we notice something that's a dealbreaker for you on a house you otherwise would buy, such as termite damage that might not be obvious because it's old and the seller has cleaned the mud tubes.    Yep... please do go it alone if we have no value to you, because the first time you have a problematic deal, you'll WISH you had a good agent."
RealEstate,3d0b39,TheWorldMayEnd,2,Sun Jul 12 23:18:50 2015 UTC,Exactly! It's all about doing your due diligence and you will be properly rewarded. It saddens me that so many agents think making a quick buck is kore important that keeping a good reputation. Because having word of mouth recommendations from past satisfied buyers arr totally worth its weight in gold.

RealEstate,3d0b39,wamazing,2,Sun Jul 12 14:33:51 2015 UTC,It's a very odd request. Did the agent say why they need those? Typically a lender's pre-approval letter is enough. Have you gotten that? Super odd request.
RealEstate,3d0b39,DelRMi05,2,Sun Jul 12 23:20:22 2015 UTC,"You don't have to provide anything you don't want to to your agent but that would be kind of ridiculous. Ask what the purpose is and as long as it's reasonable and you trust this person what's the issue? If you do not trust your agent you should not be working with them.  Edit: Shouldn't really say ""ridiculous"", I'm speaking to more of the trust but as far as tax returns in general, the lender is really the only person that needs such information."
RealEstate,3d0b39,TheWorldMayEnd,14,Sun Jul 12 20:41:34 2015 UTC,"I see a couple (potential) issues.   I don't know who else in their office or home might have access to my information. I don't know that 5 years from now this realtor throws in the towel and my information is in a box in a dumpster waiting for someone to find it and sell my info on the internet. Maybe they have a teenager with a drug problem in their home who would know exactly how to turn that into cash?   And how much I make is not really relevant to an agent, because maybe I have a big down payment and only need a small loan. Or, maybe I make more than enough to afford twice the house I'm looking at but don't want a big payment. It's just not any of the realtor's business, in any way. My lender's approval is all they need to know.   Maybe potential clients should start asking agents to see their tax returns before they hire them? Say I only want to work with really successful agents, I don't want to deal with a part time hack? So I want to see that ALL their earnings come from real estate. And I want to see that you're making a good living so you're not desperate financially, so you aren't going to push me into deals that might not be right for me or convince me to overlook problems with a house because you need to feed your kids?   If we're sharing tax returns, fair is fair."
RealEstate,3d0b39,landofmisfits,0,Sun Jul 12 12:53:17 2015 UTC,"I'll say it again: ask your agent why they want the information and get an explanation. There is nothing wrong with pre qualifying a buyer. If you do not trust this person with your information, why would you want to work with them in the first place, but...  You're right that a lenders qualification should trump everything, asking for returns would be unorthodox in my market, but more importantly; You do not trust your real estate agent. That is a huge problem that will rear its ugly head down the road. Qualify your professionals how you must, but at this stage you should know who you are working with and why you chose them.  I am not saying you have to blindly trust someone, but from years of experience, if there isn't trust in this relationship, you are in for a word of hurt. It will rear it's ugly head in the form of evaluating property, offering opinions of value, and communication. While all these things may not prevent you from actually purchasing the house you want, you will never be sure that you are being represented properly and therefore question everything your agent does. You will be in resentment from this point until closing and that can be dangerous as maybe this agent is trying to represent you properly and because you can't trust them, you make decisions contrary to your best interests."
RealEstate,3d0b39,TheWorldMayEnd,8,Sun Jul 12 13:55:32 2015 UTC,"The reason we have GLB and FCA are because too many people cannot be trusted, and no one should just TRUST someone with such important information.   Thinking about this more, I wonder if that realtor might even be guilty of an ethics violation if they aren't doing this in compliance with GLB. I think it's illegal, to ask for this and not comply with GLB"
RealEstate,3d0b39,landofmisfits,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:11:45 2015 UTC,"Could be. I am really not at liberty to say because different states have different laws and different markets have different practices. Personally, I never have a need to or want to be in control of that kind of information. The lender supersedes me in that department just as the attorney does in contract law. To your point, sometimes I don't even have an inkling as to what my clients gross a year. They are pre approved (credit check/pay stub verification) with a reputable lender and we are good to go. Not that I want to be ignorant of things but as long as I have a third party validate the qualification it just doesn't matter. The agent in question should have done something along those lines."
RealEstate,3d0b39,TheWorldMayEnd,5,Sun Jul 12 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"I've bought multiple properties, met with many agents and by and large I've learned one thing, I'll NEVER trust any agent ever.  Our interests are simply not aligned.  I want the best property for the lowest price.  My realtor wants me to go for the simplest transaction at the highest price they can get me to buy at.  How can I possibly trust someone whose best interest lies in me spending as much as possible?"
RealEstate,3d0b39,landofmisfits,2,Sun Jul 12 14:40:46 2015 UTC,"Why would an agent not want to get you the best house for the best price?  That is pretty much what we do.    I have talked clients out of spending as much as they qualify for because qualifications don't include a lot of regular expenditures, and I am trying to sell them a home, not financial ruin.  I also work regularly with investors finding flips or cash flow properties.  I would much rather have repeat business than a one off deal that makes no sense.  I am sorry you weren't able to find an agent that worked appropriately with you, but it appears that some of that is also colored by preconceived notions that no agent, no matter how good is going to be able to overcome."
RealEstate,3d0b39,DelRMi05,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:44:12 2015 UTC,"Why WOULDN'T you want them to purchase for above the buyers floor?  Let's say there is a house that was offered at $120k.  You talk to the sellers and they say the max they'd pay is $110k.  You aren't going to push to find the seller's true bottom once you know that.  If the seller comes down to $110k you're going to tell your buyers how lucky they are and how they have a deal.  Meanwhile, the seller may have actually accepted $100k.  Your seller is out $10k because they talked honestly with their agent.  In comparison, if they told you, find me the lowest price and I'll tell you whether it's good enough, you may have found that $100k.  But you don't want to do that.  By purchase for $10k more you pocket $300 more.  You have no incentive to push the price to its floor, only to the top of your buyers comfort level."
RealEstate,3d0b39,ajfa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:47:14 2015 UTC,"Nope, that is not my philosophy, repeat and referral business is worth much more than $300 in my pocket on one deal, and in addition to that, I actually care about my clients and want to put them in the best position that they can be in."

Once you find a number they'll accept, maybe you push a small amount extra to make you seem like the great guy you are, but you're not negotiating hard.  You'd be too fearful of the deal falling through, AND it hurts your bottom line."

In fact, I always tell my clients to determine what their numbers are, but often don't ask what they are so that it doesn't impact my negotiating power in any way, even subconsciously.    I am not fearful of deals falling through at all, and they can't fall through until you actually have one, until negotiations are complete, I don't have one.  Once I have one, I work my tail off to keep it together, and rarely have one fall through, unless it is in my clients best interest to let it happen (for example inspection results), and then I do."

RealEstate,3d0b39,BuildGreenville,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:02:02 2015 UTC,"On one hand you're right: an agent wants to get the sale done. A buyers agent makes more money for a home that sells for more, so at least in theory they have a financial incentive to have you pay the most possible and not fight for you!  On the other hand: a good buyers agent survives by word of mouth, and the buyer settling into the home and not feeling like he/she got screwed. When one buyer gives the agent a stream of referrals that amount to $50-100k in commissions, the $50 difference in a single commission doesn't make that much of a difference.   In some cases, the realtor doesn't know much about your needs, or what makes a good investment property, or repair/structural pitfalls of a particular home. In others cases, the realtor will have to pull punches when describing neighborhoods to avoid getting sued. Lots of realtors are opportunistic, but I do not think most are malicious.   I have realtors I wouldn't go with again. I also know realtors I'd do repeat business with."
RealEstate,3d0b39,NumNumLobster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:00:14 2015 UTC,"Then you either have never worked with a good/great agent or never trusted someone enough to see that you did. I'm sorry but I have never been one to push my clients to buying a house above their comfort range or the ""simplest transaction"". I take a lot of pride in what I do and I know not everyone does. I would never want to work for you, not because you're not trusting or a bad buyer/seller or whatever, but because if I can't earn that trust by representing you properly, then you will always second guess if I am acting in your best interest. As I said in another comment, that can be detrimental to getting what you want. (i.e. I use market expertise to give you the value of the home and you assume I'm lying or not correct because of lack of trust). The best feeling I get at my job is when I have a client/friend that I not only earn that trust or do a great job, but they defer to me for all their real estate advice as a result. The best scenario I could possible relate to is finding a good mechanic. It's not comparable with life-altering decisions, but at the same time, once I found a mechanic I trusted, I won't use anyone else, but I definitely do not trust every mechanic blindly."

Just because they do send it to you doesn't mean you are then forced to negotiate with them.  Also, yes you are now obligated to disclose the report, or any major defects in the property that you know about, to future buyers, but to be honest, their inspector should catch the same things anyway.   As for the context, I'm not sure how that all played out... It sounds like the buyers agent may have been a little nasty but I don't know what else happened"
RealEstate,3d35ll,Realestateuniverse,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:37:57 2015 UTC,"Your agent should see the full report so they can go through it with you and discuss any repair requests.   If making repair requests you should include the inspection report with the request. It does no harm to you, becomes disclosure for the seller and aids them in making the repairs.   I often get repair requests (drafted by agents) that are nonsensical. As a matter of practice I always request the inspection report before I respond so I can actually review what the inspector found and draft a coherent response that actually addresses whatever issues there were."

Recently ran into someone who has an ""emotional support"" cat. The cat goes everywhere with her, and, she claims she can take it into restaurants. She travels quite a bit, not sure if she uses only pet-friendly hotels or what but claimed to have the same rights as anyone with a service dog.   You probably need a local lawyer to give you a definitive answer that is relevant in your state.   Editing to add: does the concept of an emotional support cat seem odd to anyone else? Cats are all F-U most of the time (and I'm a cat lover...)"
RealEstate,3d0ez8,wamazing,5,Sun Jul 12 13:26:57 2015 UTC,"I could see valid reasons for it, but as a landlord I am thinking I could require a tenant to provide evidence that they have a condition that requires a support animal for adequate functioning, and that said animals are known to be therapeutic for that condition.   Just because dolphins are therapeutic for autism doesn't mean I'll allow one in my pool. Just sayin... And yeah, go ahead and sue me over it if I say no. I'm pretty laid back on animals, but I wouldn't let someone dictate what will happen in my own property, either."
RealEstate,3d0ez8,MsTerious1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:49:48 2015 UTC,"I have met a few (key word FEW) cats that are loving enough to provide emotional support, but for the most part, I'm with you. Cats are very standoffish and want to love you at their convenience lol!   And before I get downvoted, let me clarify that this does not apply to ALL cats. It simply seems to be an observation of mine and is merely a matter of my own opinion, since I know Reddit loves cats.  Although if it's simply a matter of emotional support, I suppose all animals can fit that bill. It would simply entail that the pet owner feels more emotionally stable with that animal in its presence. I think in the wake of some sort of trauma or distress, we reach out and cling to a wide variety of things. An animal is a pretty healthy companion for overcoming emotional distress, when compared to drugs, alcohol, etc. Even if it is a cat, who SOMETIMES wants to hang out with you, maybe, if you happen to have treats."
RealEstate,3d0ez8,dorkella,8,Mon Jul 13 14:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'm going to post my reply from a few other times this has come up.   I'm a SF/Bay area landlord and have been through this a few times before with tenants, including taking it through court..  Take all this with a grain of salt because IANAL just a landlord.  I have successfully evicted tenants because they've gotten a puppy without telling me, then when I told them per the terms of their lease they has signed a no pets clause, they go out and get a letter from a doctor and try to pass it off as some sort of service dog/esa.  Basically- there are a few different categories of ""service dog"" and they all tend to get lumped together because people (both tenants AND landlord) aren't clear about the laws. It's a murky area and I've found even some housing attorneys aren't clear about it. Also landlords tend to be in my experience very paranoid about the ADA, so the minute someone says ""service dog"" or ""therapy dog"" they back right off and allow the tenant to move in/get the dog. We have a little more leeway than that. Just be wary of googling about it because there is a LOT of inaccurate information out there about the regulations and a lot of bs on the web about it. There are also a bunch of websites telling people how to fake qualify their dog as a bs service dog and sadly predatory scam places selling fake service dog credentials, harnesses etc for huge markups. It all really sucks for the people who actually need the service dogs, because all this makes landlords hella skeptical of anyone claiming to need a service dog.  Category 1: Medical Service Dog- dog provides a specific function for a specific disability. So, guide dog for a blind person, seizure alert dog for an epileptic person, hyperglycemic sniffing diabetic alert dog, stability support dog for an amputee, etc.  Here is where it gets interesting and where a lot of the confusion comes from- As a HOUSING PROVIDER, landlords ARE allowed to inquire about the nature of the disability and the specific function the dog provides the tenant to alleviate that disability. You CAN request proof of the disability. This can be a SSDI payment, etc. To warrant a service dog, the person has to qualify as disabled enough to no longer perform normal activities of daily living without the support of the dog. So, a trumped up letter from a doc saying Tenant needs Fido for his opiate addiction is not going to fly. It has to be a legitimate, verified disability... disabled enough not to perform normal activities of daily living. The dog does not have to be certified through an organization but you can request documentation about the tasks performed by and training of the dog.  What differs from landlords vs someone running a grocery store is because we are a housing provider, HUD laws are different than ADA laws... so basically if someone says they have a service dog in a restaurant, the restaurant owner can't inquire further, but a housing provider IS allowed to request proof/documentation/verification yadda yadda.  Another way a landlord can disqualify a bs service dog: Even if the tenant has a documented disability and proof of requiring a service dog for a specific function, you can STILL prevent the dog based on breed restrictions. Basically, the ADA only requires landlords to allow the dog within ""reasonable accommodation"" and if allowing a service dog pitbull (or whatever breed they want if it's on the breed restricted list) is going to invalidate your building's insurance policy, you are still allowed to reject the disabled tenant and their dog. So in my case, I was allowed to reject an English Bull Terrier because they were on my insurance carriers aggressive breed list.  Category II: Emotional Support Animals- Doesn't have to be a dog. Can be a cat, parrot, goat, whatever. These are animals whose mere presence helps alleviate mental illness. Dogs not trained in any specific way, their function is to help emotional condition of owner. Not protected by the ADA or HUD. This can be a depression dog or a PTSD dog, etc. Landlords don't have to allow an emotional support animal. See more here.  Category III: Therapy Animals/Therapy Dog - these are dogs who are trained to provide therapeutic relief to other people than the owner... so for example if they took the dog and volunteered with it at an Alzheimer ward of a skilled nursing facility. Dogs ARE rigorously trained and verified by organizations like the DELTA society or the SPCA. Not protected by ADA or HUD, don't have to allow them.  And all this is moot in certain cases...... I'm not saying everyone with a service dog is lying and trying to scam, but there are a LOT of people around here who are. If I have a tenant with an actual legitimate disability, I will happily allow the service dog. Currently I have two tenants with dogs- a hearing alert corgi for a deaf tenant in one of my properties and a veteran with a PTSD emotional support dog in another... it's more that I can't let every Tom Dick and Harry who wants to get a dog decide to get one then make up some fake disability and try to pass the dog off.  If any lawyers or other landlords with more experience/knowledge about this want to chime in and correct me on anything, feel free!  I love dogs and used to allow them in all my buildings, but unfortunately too many irresponsible idiots ruined it for everyone else by not picking up their poop in the common areas and letting them bark inside of their units all day.  afaik there are no state specific laws regarding ESAs, only the national laws of ADA/HUD/FHA. Under ADA/HUD landlords do not have to allow Emotional Support animals unless the tenant is actually disabled by their mental illness. ESAs only qualify for reasonable accommodation if the tenant is so disabled by their mental illness that they are considered legally disabled- no longer able to hold a job or go to school, can't complete normal activities of daily living without the animal.  In order to qualify for reasonable accommodations due to disability, the tenant must meet the following conditions:   Have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities (such as walking, seeing, working, cleaning, dressing, and so forth) Have a history such impairments Be regarded as having such impairments   Here's the whole rule from HUD if you want to get into the nitty gritty:  http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=servanimals_ntcfheo2013-01.pdf  My day job is an MD and generally most doctors just want to help their patients, so it's SUPER EASY for a tenant to get a letter from a doctor to have an ESA.  Basically the tenant just asks nicely and they will write it.  Which is unfortunate, but generally MDs are coming from a place of caring/wanting to be helpful in whatever way they can and don't think it's their place to really say whether or not they think the tenant needs an ESA... anyway, I'd take any doctors letter with a grain of salt."

The fact is you can and should be sued.  I know of at least one person who has and continues to sue for this.

RealEstate,3d1il4,3rdIQ,2,Sun Jul 12 19:26:36 2015 UTC,"Really depends on what the estate was like. It's funny but when you work for mortgage people you get pressure to bump UP the value, but every now and then an estate wants the lowest appraisal because of taxes. Not that I ever listen to either one, I just do what the market tells me.   The bank isn't going to make a commission on the sale, so, I think you're most likely to get it for market value, whatever the appraisers think. You might ask them to select the second appraiser (and pay for that) so they are more assured of getting someone objective. Good luck. ."
RealEstate,3d1il4,wamazing,2,Sun Jul 12 19:50:41 2015 UTC,Good points.

If they were my client I might advise them that the best way to be totally sure what the market value of a house is, is to list it on the open market and see what interest it brings.

Is home equity better than a 401k? It depends. It isn't as diversified, sure, but your appreciation is based on the entire home and not your down payment.  401k, assuming 10% ROI on $100k: $10k.  Home equity ROI assuming 3.5% ROI on a $500k home that you put $100k down on: $17.5k.  10% is a pretty aggressive assumption for 401k, 3.5% is pretty conservative for home appreciation in the Bay Area.

If I had bought Apple stock 10 years ago I'd be in a good place too but that doesn't make me want to run out and buy it today.   You are smart, IMO, to be cautious about this because houses can cost you money. If you're not 100% comfortable with it, I'd wait. Save up as much down payment as you can. Every dollar you put down pays you back 20 times over the years in what you save on interest."

Your appraisal will almost never come in on target in the Bay Area. Though if you get a less desirable place in a great zip code, it'll over appraise. If the home appraises at $440k but you're paying $450, you'll need (3.5% of $440k) + $10k."

RealEstate,3cx4nl,DeezNeezuts,11,Sat Jul 11 15:34:55 2015 UTC,"Oh the other advice I'll give you, after many years of being self employed is, don't fuck with the IRS. Don't do funny stuff, don't exaggerate, don't deduct things if you lost the receipt etc. Anything out of the norm can get you flagged for an audit, but once they open up your records anything is fair game.   I have friends in the entertainment field, and a couple of them have been audited over their agent fees (which they deduct as an expense). Easy enough to prove right? But when they get in there all the meals, travel, picking up drink tabs, wardrobe expenses etc were not as clear cut and they can end up owing tens of thousands of dollars."
RealEstate,3cx4nl,wamazing,14,Sat Jul 11 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"You can't deduct things that aren't taxable. Your time isn't taxable, so, it makes no sense that you could deduct it.   I used to get cheesed off that I couldn't deduct bad checks. I spent X hours to earn that check, and, seemed only right that I could write that off as a 'loss.' My accountant informed me that's not how it works. Writing something off implies that you paid taxes on it (hence the offsetting). The few (very few) bad checks I ever got just reduced my income, and, ultimately my taxes. But they aren't in and of themselves a bad debt I could write off."
RealEstate,3cx4nl,wamazing,20,Sat Jul 11 15:54:39 2015 UTC,"This isn't the correct answer.  Hijacking to provide the actual answer:  You can, but you don't want to.  In order to deduct your time, you have to actually pay yourself.  Paying yourself for services rendered meaning you (personally) have to pay taxes on that income you earned, include state and federal income tax AND payroll taxes.  But if you don't pay yourself, that income (on Schedule E for your real estate) is only subject to income taxes, not payroll taxes.  So you save the payroll taxes ~15% by NOT paying yourself and not deducting your time."
RealEstate,3cx4nl,SammyD1st,3,Sat Jul 11 21:29:32 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer.

RealEstate,3cx4nl,wamazing,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:19:52 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'm following how this would work. When you say you pay yourself, are you talking about your corporation (or business guess it doesn't need to be incorporated...)  hiring you, as an employee, and thus you take a paycheck from the corp? Which means taxes are owed, so, the way to skip the taxes is to not pay yourself?"
RealEstate,3cx4nl,SammyD1st,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:35:35 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  Although it doesn't matter if you (the worker) is an employee of you (the landlord) or an independent contractor.  Either way, payroll taxes are due on money earned from personal services to yourself.  So you save money by not paying yourself and not deducting your labor.  Just do the work and get the income as you (the landlord)."

RealEstate,3cx4nl,dfsw,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"Assuming you form a basic sole owner LLC, which make the most sense, though it would be the same for a limited partnership and s corp.   Now lets look at the scenarios:  1) You do the repairs yourself and don't spend $10,000 on a repairman. This money is not spent and isn't considered a deductible as the IRS doesn't let you value your own time in regards to deductions. Therefore this money is counted as rental income and is taxed at your standard rate.   2) You form a company (see above) and pay from your rental company to your handyman company. You transfer $10,000 from one entity to the other. The rental company writes of the $10,000 repair, which results in the $10,000 not being taxed at all, yay! The handyman company receives $10,000 and is then taxed at your standard rate on it as it is misc 1099 income.   The result is that under both systems you would be taxed at your standard rate."
RealEstate,3cx4nl,DarkRider23,3,Mon Jul 13 02:50:14 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't make sense to. You would deduct that pay/time from one area and then have to add that pay into your income, so it's a wash."

RealEstate,3cy0li,Realestatehell,5,Sat Jul 11 21:06:13 2015 UTC,"Just want to add the reason is that people with paid off mortgages is the exception these days,  and anyone can can record a satisfaction with no proof they actually represent the lender.

If it's to rent out you could form some sort of llc and both be owners of the company.  Or get a real estate attorney
RealEstate,3cyqlj,jmoney6,3,Sun Jul 12 00:43:02 2015 UTC,"IMO, the smartest way to buy a house is to ensure every name that is on the title is the same as on the loan."

RealEstate,3cyqlj,YouWillRememberMe,3,Sun Jul 12 03:21:47 2015 UTC,"I practice real estate in KS and MO. I will describe the procedure to do what you're asking and the risks, and then I will tell you something to watch for.  Procedure: If only one of you is on the loan, the contract will be for just that person to buy. However, upon closing, you can usually do a quitclaim deed from ""Myname"" to ""Myname and partner"" to get both of you on the deed. This is the easiest and most common way to do what you're asking, but also is risky for the borrower.   Risk: If one person's on the loan and one isn't, the one who is on the loan is on the hook to keep paying for the house. The person who paid the down payment could lose their interest anyway if the other doesn't making the payments, but the one who is making the payments cannot sell without the other's consent, which means splitting up any profit. This might not seem like a big idea until you consider that there have been many cases of a non-borrower saying something like, ""I won't sign unless you give me $5,000"" when the profit is at $6,000, leaving the borrower getting much less than their fair share.   Other possibilities: With a 20% down conventional loan, I'm surprised to hear gift funds coming into play. You might want to talk to a mortgage broker instead of a banker and both get on the loan. It does not sound to me like your banker's doing you any favors."
RealEstate,3cyqlj,MsTerious1,3,Sun Jul 12 06:47:26 2015 UTC,"I would recommend setting up an LLC with both of you having 50/50 ownership of the newly formed entity. Fund the LLC with the down payment and purchase the property using the LLC so this way you both have equal ownership of the property. By having the LLC, you both would have equal ownership and claim to the potential earnings.  There are many other benefits to having an LLC such as if your tenants decide to sue you, the LLC is liable instead of you. They would be able to claim what is owned by the LLC, which will allow you to protect your personal new worth. It's pretty easy and cheap to setup an LLC. You can use serves like RocketLawyer to set it up.   I would suggest you use Mashvisor once you have LLC and you're ready to start searching for the investment property.   Hope this helps and good luck with your investment. Last note, be smart about investing with a friend and keep it professional or it will not end well for either of you."

RealEstate,3cyqlj,Mamadog5,2,Sun Jul 12 02:33:58 2015 UTC,"This is definitely a question for an attorney.   Banks sometimes limit gifts of equity, I'm surprised you can get a loan without having any of your own money in the deal.   I like the LLC deal the best of all the suggestions, but it obviously involves more paperwork than the others. But you basically are forming a company, in order to buy the house.  You mention your earnings but you really should also consider what happens if you end up losing money. If your partner puts in $20K and the house loses $30K on the value, do you agree to pay them back? Or pay them back half of the value lost? What happens if one of you wants to force a sale and the other doesn't? What happens if the place needs a repair that costs $10K? What happens if one of you is living there, and, over time you do little DIY projects that raise the value, is that value also split 50-50? What if you invested your own money for say, new flooring or new appliances, does the other party get the benefit of your investment?   No one ever goes into a deal like this anticipating an argument but I'll tell you that court and lawyer appraisals are not cheap and I've seen all sorts of plans-gone-wrong. Right now most markets are super hot, people start salivating at the dollars signs but things can  easily go the other way. Just make sure you've captured all the ""what-ifs"" in writing. Good luck."

Go see a lawyer, and set up a trust to put the house in (this must be done post-sale as banks don't give mortgages to trusts, but the conversation with the lawyer should be held now). Setting up the trust takes a couple of weeks. It's relatively expensive (if you have access to legal insurance through your employer now's a great time to sign up) but it's very worthwhile.

My experience thus far has been with the bleed you dry type.  Every time they touch the property, there is a several hundred dollar repair bill.  Never ever gave backup, never gave copies of receipts.  Always deducted from the rent.  When the tenants stopped paying rent, I found out 6 days after the eviction letter had been sent, when the normal rent deposit was short.  Horrible all around. 0/10 would not recommend.  In order for you to have a pleasant rental experience, you need a low maintenance property in a reasonably stable area with good stable employed tenants.  Condo's are good since there is no exterior maintenance.  I would rent the property yourself and I would only do it local.  You are stacking the chips against yourself if you do it long distance with a company who has no repercussions since you are 4 time zones away."

Their job is to collect and forward rents, to order repairs, and to locate tenants.   A real estate agent should theoretically be a good place to start, but be aware that agents are not trained to evaluate investments! It's important look for one who is experienced with investing in properties themselves - particularly the types of properties you're interested in acquiring!  I also encourage you to ensure that they are fully representing you and not a seller when you look at property, but having this representation may require signing a contract that locks you in to using that agent, so make certain you are satisfied with their knowledge and skill before you sign (or make sure it's a short duration contract.)"

Any thoughts on the pros/cons of the two I might consider?  Also, a friend with family involved in real estate told me that PM companies sometimes have arrangements with service providers (plumbers, etc) that end up with me getting overcharged or shoddy service or somehow getting screwed. Is that a valid concern? If so, how can I avoid it?  (Thanks for all the help, guys! This sub is so informative to lurk on because people actually get answers to their questions instead of getting laughed at and downvoted like some other places.)"
RealEstate,3cx05a,MsTerious1,3,Sat Jul 11 16:49:08 2015 UTC,"Well, all PM firms are different, but they're all going to charge you a percentage to represent your property.  That means they'll have a financial interest in said property if you ask them to help you find it.  A company that's above board would either refer you to a Realtor or send you properties they have no interests in.  An unscrupulous company, however, could try and guide you into listings they own under different names, listings they know you won't make money on but they will (for example something in a horrible neighborhood or a stigmatized property), or any number of other reasons.  Seeking a Realtor/investor is a good idea as well, as you'll have a representative who can guide you through the various pros and cons of the local investment market, and can hopefully guide you to a competent and trustworthy PM firm.  As for referral kickbacks, that becomes a tricky area.  Any licenced firm has to disclose a business relationship with referrals, even if it's something so simple as 'if I refer you to XYZ company I'll get a free Christmas ham' kind of deal.  The best advice I can give there is to research local vendors.  Yelp, Google, and Angies List can be your best friend.  If the PM rep swears up and down that someone's awesome, but the bulk of their online reviews are mediocre to bad, then I'd steer clear."
RealEstate,3cx05a,tritonx,3,Sat Jul 11 19:35:25 2015 UTC,"My management company was. Unlike your a realtor they would prefer to avoid underwater slumlords and pissed off tenants. Their interest in your success is somewhat vested for that matter. Use rentometer.com and other sources to do some of your own research first. Ask them what they think of your proposed offer and how that correlates to the rent market.  Your math is too simplistic. It will lie to you on that level. You need to factor in entry and exit costs. Since this is an investment you should look at total lifecycle. For the big picture look at your total profit. Say you buy today and sell in 10 years, what's your total income including inflation/appreciation, all costs including selling, and all revenue? Then compare this to what your down payment + entry costs would earn in the market over that time.  Your return is also more complex than that math since you could theoretically sell and reinvest the equity or refinance. You should be looking at cap rate and internal rate of return year to year.  I made the following program to help. The far right Equiv% column shows that big picture number. I.e. if I bought now and sold later I'd  be X dollars ahead which is equivalent to the same cash outlay invested at Equiv% over the duration.  http://samdanielson.com/landlordcalc/"

I realize it will cost me more than taking on the project alone, but as long as I'm still getting a 5%+ return (which seems well below what I should get) and have taken my first step into the world of real estate without falling on my face, I look at the cost as a warranty on my investment, and for that I think it provides fantastic ROI.  /worldslongestsentence  I also hadn't heard of Mashvisor or Fundrise, thanks for the links.

RealEstate,3cxxqt,nchafat,3,Sat Jul 11 19:50:38 2015 UTC,"In my experience both as a Realtor/and loan officer, I can tell you that appraisals are a combination of art/science. It's actually an art, that has it's justifications founded in science. The appraiser will take comps of similar homes in your area, and they will see if there is a like for like comparable sale. If there isn't, well, its going to be up to that appraiser to make an opinion and support it with logic/facts. So the short answer to your question is that there is no way to know, and you will find out soon enough."

In a market that is quickly going in one direction or the other, it's easy for this to get out of whack with the market. For a sales or refi purposes, they are immaterial. Apples and oranges.   In the days of lax lending standards I suppose a lot of appraisers would try to get you what you ""need"" and I know there were a lot who just plain didn't care, they'd hit any number a loan officer needed to keep the work flowing. Those days are over, regulators and investors require a lot more due diligence and inflated appraisals are more likely to be kicked back."

RealEstate,3cxs89,Chadleybradley,3,Sat Jul 11 19:03:07 2015 UTC,"$80/SF is on the low end, IME. Even if you do cheap, you're going to need to figure at least $100 but there are so many things that can have an effect on that figure. Find out what costs your city wants to charge and the fees just to apply etc. If you don't build on a site that previously had a house there can be impact fees and there will definitely be fees to connect utilities/sewer etc; these can easily top $30K in some areas.   A lot of people say, start with a good architect. But if I were in your shoes I'd find a general contractor who does custom homes. If your idea turns out to be too small potatoes, they will likely be able to refer you to someone. You don't need custom blueprints, the builder or you can probably find something that suits your needs.   Another thing you should really check out is prefab/modular housing. This is where sections of a house are constructed in a factory and assembled (quickly) onsite. These can be higher construction quality than you can get in regular site building. Not always cheap but you'd be getting something that would probably be a really solid investment, long term. It will hold up well.   Building a home is not generally cost-effective, if your only concern is cheap. Builders have an economy of scale that individual contractors can't really replicate. Construction loans are more difficult to qualify for, and I've seen many cases where the bank cut off the supply of money because the value dropped (they will likely require quarterly appraisals to make sure they aren't loaning you too much dough). So yes the bank will care about resale value. You need to have at least 20% down and I'd estimate another 20-30% in a reserve. Google half-built foreclosures in your area, this is how that happens - they ran out of cash and the bank wouldn't loan any more (and before you ask, an all-cash buyer will be the one who buys that place).   You might consider one of those fixers, and doing an FHA 203K rehab loan. The lender will set you up with a contractor who they approve, and they pay, to do all the work. You can ask for customizations, remodeling, expansion, anything that adds to the value of the house will likely be approved. The advantage to this is that you will be in a good ""location, location, location"" so that's a good thing for your value, long term. As long as everything you spend is within your loan amount, and you're still within the appraised value as-if completed, you can do a lot to get what you want."
RealEstate,3cxs89,wamazing,1 point,Sat Jul 11 19:19:47 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your reply! I hadn't thought about many of those points.

RealEstate,3cxs89,wamazing,2,Sat Jul 11 20:32:57 2015 UTC,"You need to make sure you're getting enough of a discount when you buy. In a hot market, this may not be feasible, but I'd at least look around and see what's out there. Many contractors will come give you an estimate once you find a house you like. I'd pad it a little bit for unknowns, but, you can probably get a pretty good idea."

Its way cheaper to do structural pieces in the beginning than later. Flooring and granite can be knocked out anytime.

RealEstate,3cv5e3,KyOatey,3,Sat Jul 11 04:20:22 2015 UTC,As a 1031 your replacement property would need be >$1.6mm with a mortage of a million. Your downpayment (650k) would be about 40% leaving an LTV of 60%. If your rate and term is similar to the current two mortgages i think you could have a better cashflow.    But with 16 units comes more management issues and may require an onsite super.  And consider the timing issues for the 1031. If a buyer backs on one that will mess up the whole transaction.  Best to get a contingency to reneg in both sale contracts. Also If you have two separate entities they will be tenants in common on the replacement. Still need to file two returns.

I was selling single family homes so I needed to vacate them and complete some repairs, which meant no incoming rent for a period of time. With the 4-plexes, you are less likely to sell to an owner occupant, so keeping them rented works in your favor.  Best of luck!

Specifically because of this issue.  Anywho, right now it is Friday evening and banks will not be open until Monday the 13th. Your COE is Friday the 7th. The transcripts are almost certainly not going to arrive on time.  Find a blank 4506-T on google, look at your tax returns and complete it perfectly (since this is apparently your job all of a sudden?) via typing on your computer and not hand-writing, and dig through your old bank statements for where you paid your federal taxes. That number showing on the transaction matching page 2 of your federal tax returns exactly (thus validating that you didn't provide fake tax returns) may, if this is a small or modestly sized direct lender where relationships can mean exceptions, allow the transcripts being returned to be a post-signing or post-funding condition.   So the checklist is...   Perfectly typed completed 4506-T.

RealEstate,3cvsyo,aardy,2,Sat Jul 11 05:35:48 2015 UTC,"what's the point of doing it twice? Why at closing as well?   Some self employed person, 5 or 50 years ago, probably filed tax returns saying they made a zillion dollars, closed their mortgage loan, and immediately amended their tax returns to say they made two dollars.   Self employed persons have been known, even today, to walk into the offices of mortgage lenders around March or early April and ask the loan officer (we are not CPAs, mind you) what their tax returns should say if they want to buy a house.   So that one you sign at closing is for the lender to check 2.5 months from now to see if you amended your tax returns."

Don't let it scare you off,  but don't let the market scare you either. This is a big deal yes,  but not necessarily a deal breaker,  IMO. Good Luck."
RealEstate,3cu2a0,wamazing,7,Fri Jul 10 20:36:26 2015 UTC,"This is great advice, OP, and the engineer's report will give you leverage in negotiations. Known structural defects can also complicate financing, which seller's agent will know. Underwriters here will know a lot more than me though, if any want to chime in."
RealEstate,3cu2a0,IDreamOfRedditing,3,Fri Jul 10 20:44:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks, great advice. Contractor estimate is 12k or more. Market is so ridiculous that the other offers, if real, may have waived all contingencies, who knows. But so it goes I suppose!"
RealEstate,3cu2a0,semper03,7,Fri Jul 10 22:59:31 2015 UTC,"It won't matter if the other offers have waived their inspection contingency. The seller must disclose all known issues.   Make sure to send the other agent a copy of the engineer's report. They will have to disclose it to any other buyer, whether they want to or not. They will say they don't want it for this very reason. Force them to have it    This new information should hopefull take off some of the pressure of the other offers."

Try to take emotion out of it and make a decision you can live with.   It's likely that any lender will require this fixed before they will fund a loan, unless a buyer is willing to do FHA 203K. So might be a bargaining chip for you, offer to split the difference and you'll do 203K. Otherwise the seller may need a cash buyer.   Does your lender know about this issue?"
RealEstate,3cu2a0,wamazing,3,Fri Jul 10 23:31:38 2015 UTC,"I could be mistaken, but as a property owner that is currently selling in MA, the only mandatory disclosure is lead paint.  Buyer-beware."

""Habitable"" is not the standard for GSE loans, they have to meet minimum property standards/requirements and this serious an issue means it does not. However if this is a portfolio loan, where the lender plans to hold onto it, then they can do whatever they want. Hey more power to you if you can make it work. Good luck."
RealEstate,3cu2a0,abhikavi,4,Sat Jul 11 21:46:08 2015 UTC,Contingencies might be waived but many buyers will pull out when it's a structural issue. The sellers know this.

I know you may love the place, and that's awesome. But with the headaches of constantly trying to fix some kind of foundation issue and then having to disclose that to any potential buyer down the road it just doesn't seem worth it to me. But take that for what it's worth. I've just never seen a foundation repair that really solved the problem aside from tearing it down and starting over."

Telling then to take down the fence when you know they can't put up another seems like a dick move, but that's through the eyes of a dog owner.   If someone approached me about buying something I thought I already know I'd probably be upset. Do you care about maintaining a relationship with your neighbors?   Giving up the land seems feasible if it's only a small strip. What percentage of your lot is behind their fence?   But honestly an attorney who knows your local laws is waayy better than a stranger who lives across the country and got all their legal training from Law&Order."

RealEstate,3cvn6r,wamazing,3,Sat Jul 11 13:49:40 2015 UTC,"For legal advice, definitely speak with an attorney.   For human advice, in regards to deciding the morally acceptable method of dealing with this, I'd have to agree that the fourth option is the best one. It would be much easier to go to your neighbors and present that plan without it being something that truly causes some animosity. From a personal perspective, if my neighbor came over right now and told me that my fence was on their yard by a extra inch or so on one side and they expected me to tear the fence down and rebuild it, I'd be devastated. Not that I would feel entitled to their property, but because it would be such an expensive job.   I think that if you talked to them and said ""Hey, this recent land survey revealed that your fence is slightly on my yard. I realize tearing it down would be a huge inconvenience and expense and I don't want to put you through that. Would you be okay with signing a document that says I give you permission, and only you, to use this space while you own your house? This just feels like the best solution in this scenario, because any other possible solutions would just be really costly"" they would have to appreciate that you considered them in the situation. Do you have to? No, it's your land.  But you weren't missing it before you knew it was yours, and will likely be fine without it. But I also agree that you shouldn't just give it away. Technically, you're paying for it.   The path of least resistance seems the better option for everyone."

RealEstate,3cvn6r,walterwhitmanwhite,2,Sat Jul 11 06:46:07 2015 UTC,"This question comes up quite often. In most or all jurisdictions, adverse possession has to be done in the open and against the wishes of the owner. You can simply have the neighbor sign a piece of paper stating that you are allowing him to use the land and have his fence, and that he acknowledges the boundary between your properties is where a survey would determine it to be. That eliminates any claim.   This is exactly what my attorney advised me to do in a similar situation, and my neighbor was fine with it."
RealEstate,3cvn6r,comcry,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:14:14 2015 UTC,"Even if they won't sign something to acknowledge it, I think you can grant them formal permission to use the land for 10 years or while they are the owners by well documented official letter, and this will defeat adverse possession. Make sure you involve your lawyer!"
RealEstate,3cv9yd,bdafsi91,6,Sat Jul 11 01:45:22 2015 UTC,"Usually there's contingencies that allow you to back out. So you can do an inspection and then back out. The more common sense thing to do is as quickly as possible tell the sellers you want to rescind and why (maybe you lost your job?), and because you didn't waste their time, they'll give you your EMD back. They also know you won't get financing. They also may have a heart."
RealEstate,3cv9yd,underwriter1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:42:34 2015 UTC,"Further, OP should read his purchase offer to see what contingencies he has and what the deadlines on them may be."
RealEstate,3cv9yd,ShortWoman,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:30:34 2015 UTC,"Good answer.  Though if sellers accepted the offer (and necessarily turning down others), wouldn't some time and opportunity be wasted, even if there were a backup offer?  Contingency would typically depend on whether an inspection passes right?  If an inspection passes, then that contingency can't be used to back out?"
RealEstate,3cv9yd,hahcha,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:11:03 2015 UTC,"That's where the issue of damages and the EMD come into play. If the sellers go back to the ""runner-ups"" and the ""runner-ups"" have moved on, you could see why they would feel entitled to the EMD. It varies state to state, but usually the seller has prove their case for keeping the EMD- so in most cases returns it.   There's no ""pass/fail"" per se. Typically after the inspection the buyer just says ""I am not satisfied with the inspection, please terminate the contract."" The seller doesn't want to know why because they would then be obligated to disclose it to the next buyer and, clearly, the current buyer found something. In the off-chance the seller says ""What do you want fixed- can we negotiate?"", the buyer can furnish the report and say ""Here's 50 items I want fixed. Let's say 2-3 are normal but 'major' issues like improper electrical or a leaking tub. The other 47 are minor. Rotting trim near the garage down spout. Rotting saddle on the backdoor entrance. Peeling paint on the left upper window sill. And so on. Unless a seller is very motivated, they won't pay someone to make 50 repairs, and they honor the contingency and terminate the contract."
RealEstate,3cv9yd,underwriter1,2,Sun Jul 12 19:47:44 2015 UTC,"That's what inspection and concessions are for. Now is the time to get your home inspector, do the most thorough, nit-picky write-up possible, and demand a lower price or cash toward closing. If you want to bail, just say you didn't like something from the inspection report or that the house needs too much work.   You'll spend $500 on the inspection report, but it's well worth it (and probably much less than earnest money).   If you agree on concessions and you back out afterwards, the seller will in general keep the earnest money. While this is unlikely, in some cases (i.e. a very long contract period) the seller may try to sue for additional damages (lost rent, cost of mortgage, etc.)"
RealEstate,3cv9yd,ajfa,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:31:33 2015 UTC,"Bottom line you have legally binding contract if they accept with no changes. There is a saying that real estate agents can help you get into a contract but you need an attorney to get out of one. I would definitely seek legal advice. Better to pay a little for an attorney than a hell of a lot for house you don't really want. You can always ask and they may be gracious, and there are other contingencies that may allow you to get out. But if your intent is to NOT live up to the offer you made....I would get a lawyer."
RealEstate,3cupl2,Boston_terp,12,Fri Jul 10 22:49:08 2015 UTC,"I'll be a dissenting voice.  I'm currently living in my second house from the 1890s. If you're going to live in this vintage house you have to accept that there will be all sorts of things ""wrong"" with it, from the perspective of modern code. You have three choices:   Accept that the house will have all sorts of mechanicals that are inadequate by modern standards, and commit to fixing them as you go.  That's what I do and what most people with old houses do.  Commit to bringing it up to modern code. It can be done but it's devilishly expensive. Partly because there is so much to be done, partly because nothing is a standard size so everything has to be done custom, and partly because every time you open a wall you find a dozen other things that need fixing.  Forgot the whole thing and go live in a modern subdivision.    The choice is yours. Looking over that list there is nothing terrible. The inspector told you that verbally but he had to CYA in the written report.   If it were me and I loved the house, I might try to negotiate something off the price or in a hot market I might just eat the risk and keep $5-10k in a house emergency fund.   TL;DR: It's pretty much standard for that age of house. You have to decide whether you're comfortable with it."
RealEstate,3cupl2,walterwhitmanwhite,7,Sat Jul 11 00:58:11 2015 UTC,Actually does not sound that bad. He told you the facts. He wrote it up in the inspection report to cover his ASS. It doesn't sound bad to me for a house that is 125 years old. I would definitely have someone who frequently works on houses of that age to review the items that the inspector picked up. Use it as a bargaining chip. Sounds like an awesome property.
RealEstate,3cupl2,adidasbdd,3,Sat Jul 11 01:43:37 2015 UTC,"You have painted a rather grim picture. Any one of those issues alone could be enough to cause a buyer to walk. But anything can be fixed with money.   So if you still want the house, how much do you have set aside for repairs above and beyond your down-payment and closing costs? How much can the seller afford to fix? How much cash can the seller give you at closing?   Without seeing the home, I'd say conservatively that you should be prepared to spend $50k on repairs right out of the gate.   You've got plumbing, electric, roofing, wood eating insects, and water damage. It's like a farmer's insurance commercial where the guy from Law and Order shows you what can go wrong in a house."
RealEstate,3cupl2,themeatbridge,3,Fri Jul 10 23:36:21 2015 UTC,"The plumbing and roof sound like a concern, and it sounds like both have been neglected for a while which could lead to more problems than they first appear.  I bought a fixer upper, and I'm not very experienced with home improvements. I was very nervous and stressed, I had some issues with rot, wood organisms/pests, poor upkeep etc., but I'm happy I stuck with it and it has worked out well enough. Some of the things written on the report sounded sketchy as hell, but were mostly required terminology. That said, my roof and electric were in good shape.  Get someone experienced on that roof before you commit! It sounds like you'll need electrical and plumbing work no matter what, just be sure to have an idea of the $$.  Don't be pressured into anything, but no matter what, buying your first house is definitely stressful.  Good luck!"

We have a lot of tradesmen in the family who will be available to us to support the process, and will hopefully be getting enough funds from the seller to support the fixes. I am just concerned that the repairs needed are worse than we thought as we walked through with the inspector."
RealEstate,3cupl2,canoxen,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:15:44 2015 UTC,"I kind of liken it to buying a used car.  If you look at it and notice all these little things wrong with it, it can be indicitive of other issues.  Maybe the PO didn't perform maintenance (or did it poorly).  Maybe the little issues are a symptom of bigger issues.  Perhaps the little issues combined created a bigger issue.    But when it comes to a house.  The place you live with your family and your belongings, I don't think it's usually good to buy it being really worried about it.  House repairs always take longer and cost more than anticipated."
RealEstate,3cupl2,wamazing,2,Fri Jul 10 23:21:21 2015 UTC,"IMO, this is a lot to take on as a first time buyer. The only way I would buy this house in your shoes is if I did an FHA 203K loan, where the lender brings in a contractor to fix major issues and they are paid out of escrow. You don't need to do anything. You cannot DIY this. But if your family is licensed contractors they MAY be able to get the job, not sure how a lender would look at that.   This kind of stuff is where a seller makes out like a bandit in a hot market. Buyers look with a less-critical eye. In a slow market, this seller would have to offer a huge discount for these things, or, fix them themselves before closing. The seller gets lucky in the timing of the market, but the buyer does not. Ask yourself if you want to be part of that equation. It's not a right-or-wrong answer, it's a personal choice about how bad you want THIS house RIGHT NOW.   The other thing about these kinds of issues is you may very well run into additional unforseen costs as you get things uncovered. You may not be able to just replace like with like, you've now got to comply with 2015 code. Be very cautious, and don't get caught up in the emotion of a hot market."

RealEstate,3cupl2,ajfa,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"I am not running for the hills quite yet. To be honest, this is an old house. It's going to have problems. These problems will be of three varieties:   things that aren't up to code, but who the f%&$ cares? things that are minor details, and impact your daily life, but you basically can live with things that have major impact on the structure, safety and functionality of the property, which will definitely affect resale.    Also bear in mind: the things that really end up costing money are seldom even noticed by home inspectors.  The real question is: who lived in the house before? For how long? With what financial resources? Are these minor issues that have crept up on a long-time homeowner, or signs of utter disregard for the property?   The most worrisome issues on this report are (in order):   roof. Fully replacing a roof is big bucks. It's something you want to do every 20-30 years. On the other hand, it can cost as little as $10k, and if you can extract that in concessions from the seller (and particularly cash to closing) then it's still worth pursuing the property.  plumbing. This sounds like it could be either a major cluster%$#, or a complete over-reaction given that half the homes in New England have old plumbing like this. A few leaks and a little rust is no cause for alarm. Even repairing a main line, if done correctly, can be less expensive than you'd think (depending on its layout). But if there are multiple leaky pipes with significant evidence of water damage, watch out.  front porch (unsound post): I'd take care of this ASAP, no questions asked. Get a quote from a licensed contractor, perhaps someone your realtor can recommend. wood-to-earth beam: ditto. Fix this ASAP.    electric. You really don't want to have to go through the house installing new copper wire, grounding everything properly. That can cost many thousands of dollars. But, a slightly out-of-date breaker panel is something inspectors often stress over that is not a huge deal in practice (but can be used to extract concessions from sellers).   Good luck!"
RealEstate,3ctx77,peconomou,9,Fri Jul 10 19:15:07 2015 UTC,"It's completely personal, but let's talk it out. People often times get caught up in doing things a certain way, in this case pertaining to property. But the real question is, what is most important to you. Historically, your real estate purchase will increase in value either way (This is really where your agent comes in), but you should be weighing how much your barbecuing is worth to you vs. a longer drive to work. Think long-term about it: Are you going to even be at this job in 5+ years, will you have the same passion for grilling/smoking in 5+ years, is a potential family going to complicate your job/time outdoors at some point. I like to believe there's a balance between investing in your property smartly and doing what truly makes you happy. There's room for both."

It is all over the place.  Either the houses are priced below 230k and get scooped up by cash or they are priced 350k and sit on the market forever.  The 08 crash hit palmdale hard and most of the houses are not back to those prices.  Now if you plan on staying forever then it wouldn't be so bad but I would predict that after two years of making that commute you will be over it.  How about you split the difference between Santa  Clarita and palmdale and look in that area or rent in palmdale for a year to see if you can mentally handle that drive?

RealEstate,3cuw3w,RagginMAMA,6,Fri Jul 10 23:43:08 2015 UTC,"What's the closing date on the contract? That's typically what your lender is looking at. If it's September 10 and you don't want to pay September rent and a mortgage at the same time, tell your LO you need to target 8/25 (if you want a few days to move). That's 45 days from now and should be more than enough if they're giving you a 30-40 day window. And just a head's up, closing end of the month is typically a little bottlenecked so planning for 8/25 or so gives you more breathing room, rather than 8/31 when we're running around with our heads cut off."

Con house: You are responsible for every bit of maintenance, including gardening.   Pro condo: Somebody else worries about the roof and exterior maintenance. An association that in theory looks out for the best interests of everyone. Often has access to expensive amenities such as a pool or workout room.  Con condo: Sometimes HOAs are poorly managed. Special assessments when it turns out there's no money to fix the roof or parking lot. HOA drama. People living on the other side of your walls, some of whom are noisy. They can be more challenging to buy and sell."

I think the biggest thing is if you're decent at conforming, or conforming standards are where you live, so they work for you.   If you want to park a car without any wheels on your grass at your house and really piss off every neighbour, that's fine.  Do that in an HOA and you're in trouble, and you're going to pay dearly for it.  Now if you don't mind living beside someone who is going to put their car up on the grass without wheels, then it's not a problem for you either.   Most people have someone on the block who is pissing them off, and everyone else.  If you don't know who it is, it's probably you.  In that case, a house is probably better for you, since the evil eye is easy to ignore.  Walls are definitely important, but if the homes are built property it's not a huge deal, but definitely one of the top 3 things to consider when buying a property!"

It technically doesn't even have all that much less space than my former house, it's just laid out in a more efficient way that works better with my life and I don't have to worry about any of the outside elements, which is a huge relief. It has been an adjustment getting used to having more people around and closer to me again, but it's actually nice, very social. I like seeing people out walking and my dogs love to meet & greet too. There are other aspects to living in the condo community that I am enjoying too, such as having a pool and walking trails.   I moved first for location, but also because I just didn't want to deal with a house anymore. I suggest you think very hard about your lifestyle and what is important to you. What your daily, weekly, monthly life looks like and what kind of home would support that lifestyle."

It was great in a townhouse when there was snow or landscaping to be done, and it was done before I was awake (or at work).   I have a lawn cutting service for my home now.   If a tree fell when I was in the town home, it was dealt with by the association. On the other hand, I am able to replace my fence, build a deck or repaint my house how I want.   There are advantages to each. You need to look at your lifestyle and future plans to see what fits you beat.   HOAs can be great. Or can be terrible money vultures which you have no control over.   If my budget gets tight, the landscaper goes. Can't tell the HOA to shove off."

You can put in a new door so you can rent out a room when money gets tight.     Con house - maintenance and yard care and roofs and things can be a hassle.  Pro condo - No exterior maintenance.  If it's in a good area, pretty easy to rent out.    Cons -   If your condo association sucks - you're screwed.  Condo fees and assessments keep going up and up."

IMHO, condos seem to be the best option on the surface for younger buyers wanting to be close to a city center, but whenever   I really get into looking at one and comparing the overall costs, You often pay MORE for a lesser expensive condo than a similar sized SFR.  each area may be different, in SF/BAY the condo to house price may be a few hundred thousand difference, which would make the condo more appealing, but if you're only talking 20-50k like most of the rest of America, the interest rate+HOA wash all the savings away. ie 100k condo=150k house in total monthly outlays"

Let's say you were a 726, and after a couple of pulls you went down to a 719, well, you're getting the 719 rate which is obviously not as good as a 720+ rate will be. If your score is 770 and a couple pulls bring it down to 762, it shouldn't hurt you. But you'll have to explain why you had more than one pull."

Advertising your home? Always good (go ahead and ask that people contact your agent)!  Open houses? Not going to help. Sure, they're flashy but the odds of The Buyer showing up are very small. The purpose of an open house -- contrary to what many think -- is to get leads for the agent.   Unfortunately, this doesn't fix the fact that your property may well simply be priced high for your market. I know, you can't afford to drop the price lower, but you can't afford to keep paying the mortgage forever either. You might want to consider your options: Does your state have a ""hardest hit funds"" program that can help you? Is a short sale an option? What would your personal consequences be in foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure? If you are losing that much money, is it time to consider bankruptcy?  Good luck."

We're priced lower than the 8 closest listings…none of which have a main floor bedroom and no one else has a car port. There are no glaring issues with the house from our perspective.

RealEstate,3ct8vr,ShortWoman,2,Fri Jul 10 16:51:29 2015 UTC,"Oh no no no there's nothing quick about a short sale.   A short sale is when more is owed than the property is worth. The bank will be ""short"" money at the end of the deal, so they get to approve the transaction. To make it work, you'll have to provide a bunch of personal financial information. Since you have indicated that a) you've had to move out of town and b) you've tried renting the place out but it's at a loss every month, it sounds very much like you have what the bank would consider a ""hardship."" To complete the train of thought, you can't continue paying forever, and the bank can look at the numbers and your situation and realize that if they don't take a loss now, they will likely end up foreclosing and that will cost them even more money. However, it is not uncommon for it to take months for them to reach this conclusion.   When you look for a new agent, specifically ask if they have experience with short sales. In fact, if you call a big real estate office, ask if they have someone who specializes in them."

I thought it was 80% too, but then I learned that there are actually no laws (at least in my state?) about dropping PMI when based on current value. The 78%-automatic and 80%-when-requested that everyone talks about are both based on the original value. If a lender is going to drop based on current value, they can make up whatever rules they want (with my only barganing chip being that I can refi.)"
RealEstate,3csrbs,Fercho25,2,Fri Jul 10 15:05:53 2015 UTC,This falls under the Homeowners Protection Act and if I remember correctly is stipulates the exact Fedreral requirements for PMI removal.
RealEstate,3csrbs,Look_You_Dumb_Shit,7,Fri Jul 10 15:25:38 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, this does not fall under the Homeowners Protection Act.

You will have to pay the appraisal fee which will likely be around $300 to $400.  Be sure to have a realtor friend pull some comps for you that they think are comparable.  It's not illegal to show the appraiser or the management company this data.  I hope your appraisal comes in on value, otherwise, this could be an expensive process.  Be honest with yourself.  Many folks overestimate the value of their home.  From my experience, they over value between 15% to 30%.  Try to remove the emotional attachment factor.  Good luck!  Also, I noted that Chase doesn't really want you to remove the PMI for obvious reasons and their system is set up to slow the process down.  Stay on them and be diligent."

RealEstate,3csrbs,Forgainst_it,2,Fri Jul 10 19:43:15 2015 UTC,"It's really a question for your lender. You also might want to review the docs you signed at closing,  they may hold some details about this.   I have never heard of an order of operations with regard to this, but that doesn't mean the lender doesn't have one.   Also lots of good appraisers won't work for Chase, they have a long history of treating appraisers badly. So I hope you don't get a total idiot appraiser.  Ask Chase,  and ask the appraiser how much of that $500 goes to the appraiser and how much thei management company keeps?"
RealEstate,3csrbs,wamazing,2,Fri Jul 10 15:41:36 2015 UTC,"When talking to chase, be sure to be clear in your questions and read the wording of their documents and responses clearly.  Sometimes, they won't remove PMI until the date you were originally scheduled to reach 80%. So if you make extra payments and hit 80% LTV early, you may still not be able to get it removed until the date where you would originally hit it.  I think they are required by law to remove it when you hit 75%, not matter how quickly you get there.  It is in their best interest for you to keep paying it since it is free money for them."

(I'm not criticizing - it's just likely what you'll hear.)  But it doesn't hurt to start by asking politely- maybe call your realtor and explain it like you did above with just the facts. Without turning it into a fight right away, maybe the seller will pay for it. Maybe the seller will split it with you.

Water intrusion spooks banks about as bad as they can be spooked because it can affect the homes long term habitability and value if not repaired, so chances are you won't be able to ignore their request if you want the house and them as your lender. As Trackingvcr said just send them the relevant section of your inspection and nothing else, that's exactly what I did with my current home when I amended the sales price between me and the seller due to a few serious issues that cropped up during inspection."

Unless this is determined to be a minor problem,  it's likely this is going to need to be a cash sale.   You absolutely should not put any money into a home you don't own yet. You have no rights yet. Bank sales can fall through for about 100 reasons that have nothing to do with you.   The last thing you want to do is spend $1,000 fixing something and have the seller realize values are going up, and you have now made the place easier to sell, so they will screw you and put it back on the market for $10k more."

Renovation financing is a possible solution here. If you have a real down payment and are doing conventional, conventional renovation financing. If you are doing FHA with 3.5% down, 203k fha is the relevant google search.

Even if you can't use that to prove the seller lied (even if it's obvious) you would likely be able to use your financing contingency by disclosing it to your lender.

No chemicals outside, but a few damp shady areas (large rocks, big river rocks, on landscape drippers so the ground stays damp). Spray pesticides only around the perimeter of your house and indoors if you need that. This is not a short term fix but within a year the lizards wil rule your yard and eat anything else that moves.   I have been stung a couple times, in my sleep.

I'm sure its made for tv and all that but my wife is just sitting there with her jaw dropped like ""we are never going to texas""    Think we are always scared of animals we don't naturally encounter.

RealEstate,3cthg1,ShinyLightning,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:39:54 2015 UTC,"I can recommend Ortho home defense max. I used it on my condo in South Mountain and they still managed to get in, just not very far. Every one that I found was dead already. If you do walk from this house, just know that you're more likely to have scorpions when the area is near or once was a: pecan grove, citrus grove, desert area or backing to a mountain. You don't get them as often in areas that were farmed where the land was dug up a lot, but you can still get the boogers anywhere. Good luck!"
RealEstate,3cthg1,ShinyLightning,3,Sat Jul 11 03:49:55 2015 UTC,"Per the Arizona (AAR) sales contract, the earnest money is considered the damages awarded to the seller in the case of buyer default. They can try to come after you for damages beyond that (because you don't need a valid reason to sue someone, you just need to pay a filing fee), but if case history prevails, they will get their case thrown out of court, because what you agree to in writing kinda matters.  That being said, scorpions are pretty easy to treat for &, once the infestation is cleared out, preventative measures can be taken to ensure it doesn't come back. As you said, scorpions are just a part of living in the desert here, but they can be managed.  I would advise getting a second opinion from a trusted pest extermination company & have the home treated before move in. You may also want to consider routine treatment (some people do it monthly, some quarterly & some yearly) to protect against them coming back. Speak with your neighbors & see how they approach the issue, as they'll be the best insight to handling the issue, more than likely. Good luck to you both!"

RealEstate,3cswgs,ICanNeverThinkOfOne,6,Fri Jul 10 14:40:04 2015 UTC,"Pools have been my family business since 1994. I no longer work in the industry, but have about 15 years experience under my belt.   Vinyl: Personally my least favorite, you are limited to square or rectangle shapes in most cases, the liner can be ripped causing leakage. (ex, the dog jumps in the pool and tried to climb out).  The liner will need to be replaced every 5-10 years or so, which costs several thousand dollars in materials and labor. (if you keep your chemicals balanced, which isn't difficult, it will last longer).  The only advantage with vinyl is that they tend to be the cheapest inground pool.  Fiberglass: I don't have a ton of experience with these, as most pools in my area are vinyl or gunite. These are basically prefab pools that they drop into a hole. You have more options for the shape of the pool than you do with vinyl. In my opinion, more durable than Vinyl as you won't be able to ""rip"" fiberglass like you can a vinyl liner.   Gunite: Full disclosure, my family company specializes in gunite pools so I may be a bit bias, but I'm trying to give an objective opinion from my personal experience. Gunite, in my opinion, looks the best of the 3. You have the freedom to make any shape you like (My father once installed a pool that was shaped like a Goldfish cracker, another he did was a 4 leaf clover). You have MANY options for the finish of the pool. Most base pools are a standard guinte with a clear plaster over it, but you can go pretty high end with pebbletec or pebblesheen finishes, which are made up of ground up pebbles that can be colored. you have tons of color options. Plaster on a pool will last 15-20 years if you keep your chemicals balanced properly.   As far as your other questions, pools rarely increase the resale value of a house. (an exception might be some super high end pool with proper landscaping). Never buy a pool as an investment. As far as maintenance, all 3 pools will be identical. Pick 1 day a week to check your chemicals, and balance accordingly. I usually recommend chlorine as its easy to deal with and cheaper than the chlorine free alternatives. I also typically recommend sand filters as they are by FAR the lowest maintenance of the 3 filters (Sand, Cartridge and DE). DE does filter out finer particles, but requires changing the DE every week or 2. Never get a cartridge filter on a pool unless you have no other choice (usually in a watersehd area where you can't discharge the pool to backwash the and filter or discharge the DE).       If any pool company tries to sell you on a ""chemical free"" pool. Run! Many companies are pushing salt generation systems, which are pretty great, but they only handle the sanitation of the pool (i.e. it replaces the need for chlorine). However you still need to keep your PH, Alkalinity and Calcium hardness levels balanced. This isn't as difficult as it sounds. Typically when you open the pool you'll need to add a decent amount of chemicals, but once its in the swing of things you are basically checking it weekly to make sure the PH is balanced and chlorine is in the pool, possibly adding a little harness or alkalinity as needed. (usually after a heavy rain)  Cleaning them isn't difficult, it only takes about 20 minutes to vacuum a 20X40 inground pool (assuming its not totally full with leaves). You can do this once a week or as needed depending on how it looks. Or you could spend $1,000 on a robotic vacuum that you just drop in, let it clean the pool, and take it out when its done.   Sorry for the wall of text! Hope some of this info helps. TL;DR I recommend Gunite pools with a sand filter. Pools are pretty easy to take care of, even easier if you live in a warm area when you never have to drain and winterize it. However, a pool rarely increases resale value unless you find a buyer who REALLY wants a pool or you have something very high end with proper landscaping."
RealEstate,3cswgs,drnick5,2,Fri Jul 10 16:00:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you say except for the filters bit.  DE and sand filters require you to backwash frequently, which dumps expensive water along with expensive chemicals down the drain.    Cartridge filters only have to be cleaned once per year, and the pressure drop across them is a tenth of a sand or DE filter, meaning you get MUCH more flow out of the same pump."
RealEstate,3cswgs,MoreAlphabetSoup,2,Fri Jul 10 16:13:51 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with you on this, but I understand what you are saying. Yes, both and and DE filters require you to backwash the filter (usually once a week, or once every other week, depending on your pressure). You usually backwash for about 1 minute, then do a rinse for 15 seconds or so. (on a sand filter). Sure, you're dumping water, but its probably 1% of the pools volume and shouldn't effect the chemical balance.      Cartridge filters are awful for an inground pool in my opinion. (at least in my area of new england). You need to get one of the giant 4 cartridge units in most cases. The cartridges should be cleaned semi often, usually once a season (more so if you have a lot of pollen around) and they are a pain in the ass to clean. Cartridges also need to be replaced every few years, and they are expensive! (for the big ones, it can easily be a few hundred per cartridge... and you need 4 of them!).   Sand will typically last 5 years or so before it needs to be changed, meaning besides the weekly/biweekly backwash, theres nothing else you need to do. They are by FAR the easiest to maintain over the long term in my opinion.   As far as flow is concerned...I've never had a problem with sand in this regard. We typically use 1 or 1.5HP pumps with sand filters and haven't had any problems."
RealEstate,3cswgs,drnick5,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:31:53 2015 UTC,"I was backwashing my sand filter mid way through every vacuum. It got really annoying. Granted, my sand filter was slightly undersized and my cartridge filter is oversized. My cartridge filter lasts the whole season before cleaning is required.  125 GPM over 1:15 is 150 gallons of water, or the equivalent of a 75 minute shower every week (probably more). It doesn't affect the water balance immediately, but you're going to have to add 150 gallons of unchlorinated, unbalanced, and unstabilized city water to your pool, that will need treatment no matter how you look at it.  My cartridge replacements are $300. Not to bad over 5 years.    You've never had a problem with flow because your not paying the energy bills. Had you been installing cartridge filters you could have been using 1/2 or 3/4 HP pumps and gotten the same water turnover rate."
RealEstate,3cswgs,MoreAlphabetSoup,2,Fri Jul 10 19:11:28 2015 UTC,"Well sand does need to be changed every few years (I believe the rule of thumb is 1 year for every 50lbs, so a 200lb sand filter should be changed every 4 years or so). Having an undersized sand filter will definitely cause flow problems, if you have old sand... it will be even worse. If you had to backwash that often, it sounds like it needed to be changed.   I'd never use a 1/2 or 3/4 on an inground pool (well, any standard size inground 16x32 or bigger). I'm not sure where you are getting your 125GPM. but as an example, a hayward 1HP super pump will do 75 GPM. The goal is to turn the water over once per day, so a 75GPM would take almost 7 hours of running to turn the water over once in a 20x40 pool. I don't see how its possible to use a 1/2 or 3/4, regardless of the filter, on any inground pool, unless you want to run the pump 24 hours a day... but THAT would be wasting energy ;-)  When vacuuming, you can use something like a skim vac plate to catch most of what you vac up in the skimmer as opposed to being caught in the pump's basket. If you combined that with a skimmer sock on the basket, it would catch most of what you vac up before even hitting the pump or filter."
RealEstate,3cswgs,drnick5,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:42:09 2015 UTC,"The sand was new, just had a lot of pollen and small debris that made it through the baskets.   I designed my pump for a 4 hour turnover rate according to the WHO pool sanitation guidelines.   A Hayward super pump will do 75 GPM at some design pressure loss through pipe, fittings and mainly the filter.  If the pressure loss is less than what the pump was designed for, it will pump more water."
RealEstate,3cswgs,MoreAlphabetSoup,3,Fri Jul 10 21:04:18 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you are, but typically a pool doesn't help your home's value, and more commonly hurts the value.  The problem is not everyone wants a pool. There are some people that do, some people that might, and some people who are steadfast against it.  When selling the property, you are automatically eliminating a decent percentage of prospective buyers.. The people that don't want them and the people that are not sure.  TL;DR: Most situations a pool, regardless of its build, hurts resale value."

RealEstate,3cv7q6,Damiana1365,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:55:40 2015 UTC,Agreed. Observatories observe cosmic and electromagnetic radiation (light). Nothing to be worried about.
RealEstate,3cv7q6,underwriter1,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:27:18 2015 UTC,"Consider the slight impact on marketability when you sell. You'll have a somewhat slimmer market willing to buy a house right next to an observatory vs a house whose neighborhood has more residential features. That might mean a slightly longer marketing time and a slightly lower sale price when you sell. If you're buying it at a 5-10% discount from comparable houses in the area that dont have an observatory, expect to pass that discount onto the next buyer."
RealEstate,3cv7q6,sarcasticorange,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:49:53 2015 UTC,"Generally speaking, observatories observe, they don't produce.

RealEstate,3cshz9,ShortWoman,6,Fri Jul 10 13:21:52 2015 UTC,"Number one, get a buyers agent. She will help you determine what's going on (including why this property has been on the market for 500 days). She will also guide you through a complicated business transaction that you've never done before. And since you are cost conscious you'll love this next part: she's almost free to you! The seller will gladly pay her, although you might have a document/transaction fee of a few hundred bucks.  Number two (and I say this a lot), don't fall in love with this or any property you don't own. You can make a good house into a perfect house after closing. There is a lot that can happen between seeing pretty pictures on the internet and sitting down to closing. Adding an emotional component will make it more difficult, can cause you to spent too much money, and might make you make stupid mistakes. While that's true of any property, there's more going on with this one. I suspect there is a good reason it's been on the market that long, and it's a deal breaker (my top suspect based on the pictures: permits and code on the barn and garage).  Back to your original question: good on you for not wanting to blow all your cash at closing! Remember to estimate that you'll spend 2-5% of the purchase price on closing costs over and above your downpayment. If you have not already done so, it's time to run your finances past a mortgage guy and get your pre-approval letter. The mortgage guy will be able to estimate your costs better than we possibly can.  Good luck!"

I was told (not sure if its BS or not from her) that noone was willing to work on it because it wasn't up to code, but this doesn't make sense to me as how will it ever be up to code if noone works on it?   Sounds like bullshit really. Anything can be brought up to code with enough money. You sure your mom just isn't following up with these contractors, like you said she doesn't, and then lies to you guys about it to cover her ass?"

And a large enough check that someone will want the job.   Just FYI, manufactured homes that have been added onto, moved, or modified in any way can be very difficult or impossible to finance.  So if you are building something with hopes of selling or financing this later, don't do that."

RealEstate,3cr131,Realestateuniverse,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"Just go with a nice used doublewide and trash the one she's currently in. In all honesty if its that bad its not worth fixing and for the money you will put into it you could have gotten something much nicer. My husband and I bought a trailer to fix up and we are at the point where its one problem after another and we could have had a decent downpayment for something nicer. Older trailers unless they're well maintained to begin with just aren't worth sinking money into. Save yourself a million headaches and look for something nicer. In my area you can get a pretty nice doublewide for 20,000, sometimes less."
RealEstate,3cssb4,bladeofglass,4,Fri Jul 10 14:06:09 2015 UTC,"Does your contract have a financing contingency in it?  Assuming so, without the insurance info, there is no loan.  Without a loan, there is no sale.    You Realtor should be well aware of this and should be hounding the listing agent (who should be hounding the seller, who should be hounding the HOA).  How long have you been waiting for this info.  I'm the President of my HOA and in my experience lenders seem to leave these requests until the last minute, which is annoying as hell - how far in advance of closing did the lender request it?"
RealEstate,3cssb4,zooch76,2,Fri Jul 10 14:08:19 2015 UTC,"leave these requests until the last minute   Not exactly.  A commitment letter, as well as other lender disclosures, will tell the loan applicant/borrower what is required, including evidence of insurance.

Can my lender deny the loan anyway since they never received the documents in time?"
RealEstate,3cssb4,mdconnors,2,Fri Jul 10 14:43:33 2015 UTC,"Twelve days is a long time, at least in terms of the lender asking for info; in my experience, requests for this info in the final week are not uncommon.  Consider yourself lucky, but I do understand why you would be worried and you definitely want to keep on them.  The lender could deny the loan, but your mortgage broker will do what he can to make it go through, even if it's late.  After all, he only gets paid when the loan closes."

Like /u/NumNumLobster said, you've had bad representation, but probably not illegal representation, and it's really hard to do something about the merely bad...there are few tools, but the written account is one.  I agree with what he said:  watch them like a hawk as the title folks become involved.  Daily checkins (via email is great, because then you have proof you communicated and they ...either did or didn't.) are essential.    After closing (and, unfortunately, paying commission) I would suggest you compile all your notes and accounts of what happened, keeping them strictly factual.  Then write an accompanying letter, in which you can mention any feelings or anger about this behavior, and how unacceptable it is (and it is!).  Stick to expressing your feelings in the letter, and use the written account of what's happened to back you up.  Send the letter and attach your account of the goings-on to the agent's broker (unless the agent acts as his own broker) and copy the local and state board of REALTORs.  That's about all you can do, aside from using social media, and once closing has passed you're free to do that too.  Stick to verifiable facts only, don't editorialize.  Truth is your weapon."

RealEstate,3cqdrt,XOrAcLeX,2,Mon Jul 13 00:58:18 2015 UTC,"Writing reviews and providing documentation is the easiest way to hold someone accountable, in any industry, not just real estate. It's unfortunate that the agent clearly didn't ask some simple questions on your behalf. There's clearly no excuses for it when reading your comments objectively. Unfortunately the agent has done their job in finding you the property so even if you fire them, they will most likely still receive compensation. The only way to truly make a difference in this industry is to hold people accountable and review the agent on third party sites. Agents like u/shortwoman, /u/NumNumLobster, and many others in these forums desperately want to improve the industry as a whole and you guys can do this via consumer demand. The barrier to entry is too simple and the market gets flooded with agents that are not dedicated to being professional. If this agent is a good agent, hopefully whatever feedback you provide is taken as a lesson and that agent can work on improving. From my perspective, this business isn't rocket science, and is much more about managing expectations than it is selling a home, that's the easy part. Best of luck to you in your new home. In a couple of days, or months, this will be far behind you."

I'm not saying to let him/her walk alone but how can you not be able to walk around the corner with your kid.  Driving?  Yeah the traffic is going to get congested and if the winter is too bad or you just prefer to drive the kid to school it isn't a hassle to drive the kid.  If you have a kid young enough that has to be walked into school I can see that issue with driving up to the drop off point, telling your kid to enjoy prison school, and drive off.

Sooner or later your kids will outgrow the school and you won't have that benefit anymore.    I would still personally live close to a school, depending on the crime rate of that area and other factors.  There's more to a good area than just being close to a school.

Problems arise if pet urine, especially cat urine, has seeped thru the pad and into the sub-floor. Cat urine requires an enzyme-based cleaner to get rid of the smell. Even enzymes only work 1/2 the time for cat urine meaning the subfloor might have to replaced. For dog urine you could palm sand out the affected area and cover it with some polyurethane.  Theres also the outside chance the carpet is really old and no amount of cleaning will get rid of the smell."

It just places the extra burden (financially and aggravation wise) on you instead of you placing it on the landlord.   and nowhere to stay other than our current residence.   again, they have these places that you can go and pay by the night.  They are called hotels.  They have cheaper versions as well, they are called motels.  There are options.  Again though, this places the burden on you as opposed to you placing it on the landlord.  Honestly, I am glad I never had to go through this but if a tenant did this to me when I had someone lined up to move in I would file an eviction.

RealEstate,3croad,TacticalSandwich,2,Fri Jul 10 06:23:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a real estate analyst in CA. I deal with Prop 13 everyday. The only things you need to worry about are change of ownership (selling, basically only hurts the next guy anyway) or adding to existing improvements. Even with adding to existing improvements, only new portions are reassessed. Don't forget about Prop 8 either. If someone with a similar property in the area sells for much less than yours you should consider contesting your taxes. You could get them lowered."

I'd ask them if they are serious and get some base terms out like the purchase price, down payment and how long they want to have an option to purchase for.  If that is generally agreeable say you want to talk to your lawyer about it before making a decision and bring it to them."

RealEstate,3cqjjo,icantrange,3,Fri Jul 10 00:03:54 2015 UTC,"Alright awesome now the next bit of fun math. You say 200-250k That's a down payment of anywhere between 10k to 12.5k. You want to realistically at closing table bring 20-25k. Closing costs, appraisal, inspection, termite inspection, misc fees. 5-10K. So yea you can afford that lets take higher numbers 12.5 + 10 = 22.5K There are other fees that you need to pay as well: Taxes, Insurance, Attorney.. say 5-7k. Yea pretty good start you would be good to go with 20-30k"
RealEstate,3cqjjo,Generic09,2,Fri Jul 10 00:12:21 2015 UTC,Exactly what these guys said. I bought my first house last year solo for $229k. I put 5% down on a conventional loan an I needed in total around $24k for downpayment and closing costs. We weren't able to negotiate because there were multiple bidders. Now I'm trying to get rid of the PMI because the property value went up this last year around $70k.
RealEstate,3cqjjo,Generic09,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:57:30 2015 UTC,"So the PMI continues up as the value goes up dynamically, or is it because you got the house appraised that they increased the PMI? I guess I'm not understanding"
RealEstate,3cqjjo,justathoughtfromme,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"No PMI remains the same, but it's an added cost for not putting 20% down. So once the Loan to value goes below 80% you can have the PMI removed. Right now I'm paying around $120/month and I'm in the process of not having to do that. I have to get my house reappraised so the bank recognizes its current value."
RealEstate,3cqjjo,justathoughtfromme,4,Fri Jul 10 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"For you PMI question, you may have another option that I didn't realize could happen until I was shopping for a loan.  I was in the same boat as you (same price range, same amount of down payment).  With the credit score I had and the down payment amount available to bring to the table (~10%) the loan company we went with, we had two options: have a PMI payment every month ($52) until we reach 20% equity or prepay a specified amount (a little over $2100) which got rolled into the total mortgage we were taking out.  So long as we lived in the house more than about 3.5 years, we came out ahead and don't have to pay any more PMI.  You might see if that would be available to you too."
RealEstate,3cqjjo,irka19725,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:53:53 2015 UTC,"Hi, what do you mean by prepay? Wouldn't you just put the prepay amount towards the down payment to decrease the LTV?"
RealEstate,3cqjjo,slambur,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:00:32 2015 UTC,"I essentially prepaid 3.5 years worth of PMI payments and then don't have to pay anymore for the life of the loan.   We ran the numbers and if we had put the upfront amount of PMI into the down payment amount instead, we still would have paid more in PMI payments over time as we were reaching the 20% mark."
RealEstate,3cqjjo,aardy,3,Sun Jul 12 23:04:39 2015 UTC,"Ask your lender about lender paid mortgage insurance. Your interest rate would be an eighth or a quarter higher, but the lender would cover your monthly mortgage insurance payment. In your price range, your looking at maybe a $40 difference in monthly principle and interest payment vs adding usually over $100 for mortgage insurance."

RealEstate,3cqjjo,ononono,2,Fri Jul 10 22:01:32 2015 UTC,Yeah but that $40 is over the whole life of the loan (or until you refinance) the monthly Buyer paid option makes better sense financially
RealEstate,3cqjjo,scoobydoobiedoodoo,3,Sat Jul 11 07:03:34 2015 UTC,"It looks like I'm going to have to go with PMI. If we save money faster than we expect, can I pay down the PMI loan amount faster to get rid of it, or are there penalties in doing so?   No PMI.   80/10/10. Pay down the 2nd mortgage when you want, and then the payment on it is guaranteed to go away. Or if you find the money to pay down 1/4 of it, the payment will go down by 1/4. Bonus points b/c the monthly cost is almost always cheaper than PMI right out of the gate."

I currently have 4 listings, plus two listing appointments this afternoon, plus 5 pending deals and 2 sold.   My advise based on reading your struggle is that you need to network with some lenders. My saving grace that has saved 3 of my deals from falling apart is that I have a lender at a local credit union that has kept them together when other loan originators could not. With that many leads, just grab the lead and meet with them then send them directly to your lender. One day a week you need to be making appointments to go meet with a lender and let them know you have a surplus of leads that need approved. If the lender can't get them approved go to the next one. Keep cycling through until you have four or five that can get approved and put the ones that can't on a get my credit fixed follow up plan and call them once a month to see if they have made any improvements. Take those four or five leads that can get 90 percent letters and start looking at houses in person. Once you get one in contract, go back to the lead pool and pick one out and start over so that when they close you can keep the ball rolling."

RealEstate,3cp91s,907Pilot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:19:38 2015 UTC,"Our team works with a team of lenders directly so getting the leads qualified in time is not the issue. The main issue is that the leads can't get qualified regardless of the lender they are working with. We have set up systems for them to start fixing their credit, or debt, or whatever it is holding them back from qualifying. I'm sure a lot of these will come around eventually though...   Also, I have noticed that a lot of people say they are a year or two out but actually aren't I've still been following up with them often but haven't had any conversions on that yet. Even after realizing that they can qualify in their current situation."
RealEstate,3cp91s,Joulden,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:32:05 2015 UTC,"Ok so check it out. The reason for going to the lender is to establish a relationship with you.   Ok right now you have a client with 10 percent down and a he tells you he has a 500 credit score. He makes a million a year and wants a 500k property. Which lender do you send him to?  Not your every day scenario but if it's me, I'm going to send that one to a lender that can convert that 50k into as much credit recovery as possible and do some rapid rescoring and get me a loan with as little down as possible. I know who that guy is because he did a similar scenario for me.  What about this (what happened to me today): I have a client in contract on an RD loan where the house is winterized and I have a 7 day inspection window. Everything is scheduled and paid for except the lender tells me literally with minutes to go that their company doesn't allow pressure testing on heating systems. Well I call a guy that I have a great relationship with at another lender and I tell him I really really need a favor. Now this guy I've sent some business to (most of my current clients) so I know I'm good for it. I tell him I really need a 90 percent ASAP and I need clearance for a pressure test on the boiler. Guess what I got 45 minutes later?  It wasn't just the lender, either. Not to pat myself on the back but right now inspectors are two weeks out minimum but I called one that I have referred a lot of business to and was able to get an inspection scheduled for the next day. You bet your ass I'm gonna find out what kind of scotch he drinks after that one.  Without knowing who and what your lenders and other business assets are, you are just a name and number to those guys. It doesn't matter of your brokerage has the best lender network in the world, I guarantee there is someone in some office that those lenders will drop what they are doing to work for. That's the purpose of getting in front of them and making friends."

I just kept putting out there to everyone that I was getting my license, and then during the transition period I was giving out my card to everyone and letting them know no one will work harder, etc. My fifth was a floor lead that I just happened to be in the office for.

Gotta have enough data. So IMHO you should not pay more for this house than for a similar place without solar. There is not a clearcut win for you.    The new generation of solar equipment is too new to say how it will hold up, from a maintenance and efficiency standpoint.  This technology could change rapidly,  lots of unknowns.  Are you an early adopter type person who likes being on the cutting edge?    And I have heard some horror stories about leases (you say this isn't a lease so may not apply here) with terms that make it impossible to sell or refi, as the solar company goes to first position if a new loan is made. So just read all the fine print very carefully and make sure you understand everything.  We have had a few solar companies go bankrupt here already.   Some communities here are full of non working solar systems from the last time this industry boomed."

RealEstate,3cr8mi,ShortWoman,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:55:45 2015 UTC,"Ok, first -- as your post clearly indicates -- you know perfectly well that the 6% gets split between the buyer's and seller's agents. So each agent is only getting 3%.  So what does the seller's agent do? A whole bunch of research on what comparable properties are available, what have sold recently, and the prices (both list and sales). He runs all the marketing: photos, sign, MLS entry, online ads, print ads, fliers, mailers. He fields all the phone inquiries and weeds out more idiots than you really want to know about. He previews offers so they can explain the pros and cons of each one to you in detail. He manages the transaction and make sure all legally required disclosures are given to the buyer's agent (who gives them to the buyer). He helps you avoid pitfalls and advises you on negotiating when necessary.   And what about the buyer's agent? She starts by making sure her client can really afford to buy a property. She educates her client on the market, sets up searches, calls listing agents to make sure there's no surprises, spends many hours touring properties with her clients (often during time she'd rather spend with her family), writes up purchase offers (in a seller's market, she ends up writing several for each and every buyer), coordinates all due diligence activities, makes sure the mortgage guy is doing his job, and advises her buyer on any needed negotiation.

Now, the seller may not agree to extend the financing contingency (although unless they think they can get a lot more money this is unlikely), and if they won't extend it you have a decision to make about whether you want to move forward, but no one has broken the contract.  /not your atty"

RealEstate,3cqqth,SurrealPixel,6,Fri Jul 10 00:42:28 2015 UTC,"Modular home or manufactured home? First get your head around the different types, there are advantages and disadvantages to each.   Manufactured are built to HUD code. This are what are typically referred to as ""doublewides"" and they can be financed with typical GSE financing (Fannie, Freddie, VA, FHA etc) with regular market rates. I'm sure there are lots of dealers of these in your area, but, be really leery of a land-home deals through a dealer (where they sell you the lot and the house). These are often very inflated to allow for dealer profit. In fact, if I'm appraising a manufactured on land I'm not even allowed to use dealer sales as comps. So that should tell you something about them. If you go this route, definitely purchase the land first and then shop around for a house you like and have it delivered and set up.   If you buy a new home this way, well, it's kind of like buying a new car. Really cool to have everything be just the way you want it and bright shiny and new, but the depreciation on them can be steep. Not a concern if you plan to be there long term, and if your market is hot, the depreciation will be minimal. BUT there are probably a ton of bargains out there for used ones of these, that might just be a couple years old. Definitely worth a look because costs to hook up utilities and install septic etc, will already been done. Bear in mind a MFG that has been moved from its original installation location can not be financed by traditional means. A manufactured that has had any additions will need inspected by a structural engineer before you can get a loan, unless things were very well done, this is a bad idea, I'd pass on anything like this that has been modified.   If you didn't mean manufactured, and you really meant modular, be aware that there are two main types. One of them you can finance, the other is near impossible to finance. An on-frame modular will look a lot like a manufactured HUD home, but it's built to God only knows what code. Big GSE lenders do not loan on these. You may be able to get private financing but it will be more expensive. (Sometimes even experts can't tell the difference between a HUD home and an on-frame modular, but the HUD homes will have a red data plate on each exterior section).   An off-frame modular is basically no different than a site built house, but the sections are constructed in a factory, and the sections assembled on site. This will meet local building code and be financed the same way as any other site built house. You may not be able to tell the difference by looking at it, from a site built house. Can be very high quality because the factory can control things much more rigorously.   Your first step should be getting pre-approved by a lender, and seeing how much loan you can get. You probably don't want to borrow as much as they will let you ha ha. If you're not familiar with the area please find a realtor who specializes in the type of house and community you are interested in. As an appraiser the worst rip-offs I've seen have been have been of non-local buyers. Good luck."

Just because they are well off doesn't mean they should bail him out.   I don't know that asking him to sign something is going to accomplish anything. If his name is on that other debt, then, he's responsible anyway, and, he's responsible on the lease. Although it might ease your mind, if he willingly signs that then that shows he has good intentions, at least at the moment.   I'd see if I could find a place to live, that I can afford on my own, and I'd ask the landlord to try to find another tenant and let me out of the lease. Ask your ex to pay any fees associated with this since, he's the one who's actions necessitated this.

If he bails and doesn't pay you'll either have to cover his rent and then try to sue him to get the money back or default on your rent at the same time at which point you'll have a hard time finding a new place to live.

You might also ask him to help with some of your closing costs. That is pretty standard in my state.   I think it is a good deal considering how much money you will have to put in to it. Of course, it depends if the units are updated and ready to go or if they need some work.   Also check the age of the roof and building as the older these are, the more you should account for expenses.   All in all, once you move out you will have a triplex that cash flows about $600/month. Not bad for getting in with such little money down.   Edit: 165k offer price is contingent on the property being in good condition. If it needs repairs.

A 50% hit rate is unbelievable, you could make good money selling leads.  I would offer $170,000, before you do that though, make sure you have a lender lined up and ready to go. Nothing worse than wasting a bunch of time and finding out the lender doesn't want any part of it.  You're basically looking at a fully leveraged deal (3.5% down) and living in one of the units, breaking even is actually pretty sweet. You'll have hardly any of your own cash in the deal and you're paying the mortgage with OPM.  I like it. I would probably do it if I were you.  I did a deal like this when I was in college (my first one) it worked out great.   Closing with the FHA loan will require good title and appraisal, so I don't think you'll be exposed there.  When you move out you should be able to clear $4-500/mo. For $6-7K initial investment, I think those are great returns.  Good luck."

There were months I had to put cash in, but it was no big deal, I was pretty much breaking even living rent free.   I sold it in 1999 after I graduated.

RealEstate,3coa2h,ry_ns,5,Thu Jul 9 13:27:51 2015 UTC,"ask them for a copy of your lease asap.    it might have a buy out clause in it.    If they don't have a copy either, yay you just got to give whatever the statutory notice is and walk.    //sometimes in management changes like you described, these things disappear :)  I've had to evict tenants without a lease before"
RealEstate,3coa2h,NumNumLobster,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:03:04 2015 UTC,"I have a copy of our lease as of yesterday.  I requested it and it took them a couple days.  It does show a buyout clause, but according to an attorney friend...it sounds as though I should wheel and deal with them like I would buying a car.  Fun fact: the current rate that we are paying for our loft is roughly $300-$400 under market value...They could make more money if we left. Minus the cost of paint seeing as everything else is in pristine order."
RealEstate,3coa2h,minze,2,Thu Jul 9 16:55:20 2015 UTC,"If what you said at the bottom is true, I would ask the property manager nicely to be let out of your lease without any fees due to finding a new home. Other than that, no not really. You will most likely have to eventually talk to the regional manager. Other than that, no you don't really have much."

This is foolish and I'm not playing games to get things accomplished.   My outlook: you had one job, AND it is a small loft community. We all know each other and many people left/broke leases when they fired the previous staff.

How do you know that this is true?   They have charged the wrong amount of rent the past three months (correct amount is written CLEARLY in our lease)   I know you read the lease, but have you seen what they have on file?  I say that because this statement:   They attempted to charge us for maintenance needs that are considered make-ready twice. (some things were not finished when we moved in)   Seems like they might not have a copy of the lease on record to know what should be going on."
RealEstate,3coa2h,kegman83,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:20:02 2015 UTC,They are charging $50 less than what we agreed to on the lease.  The maintenance charge was handled finally after speaking with the new property manager the second time. (she said it was handled the first time)
RealEstate,3cnh3b,gadela08,9,Thu Jul 9 07:20:27 2015 UTC,"I think people misunderstand what ""staging"" is.  Staging is simply presenting your home in the best possible light so sellers will feel comfortable in it and can imaging themselves living there.  It doesn't have to be expensive and it doesn't have to be anything like those fake reality TV shows where people are painting cardboard to look like expensive furniture.   Clean the house.  Make it sparkle.  Don't forget inside cabinets, baseboards, etc. De-clutter the house.  Remove all items that are personal to your family like pictures, momentos, etc.  Remove all excess decorative items like knick-knacks. Make sure there is no excess furniture in the house.  If your family room has a sofa, loveseat, chair with ottoman, bookshelves, whatever, make sure that there is plenty of room to walk around all the furniture.  You want to make the room look spacious.  You may have to remove the loveseat or chair and ottoman to make the room feel more spacious.   Bedrooms should have a bed and dresser, maybe a small bookcase or desk if it is a large bedroom.  Beds should be made with fresh linens (no faded or yellowed linens).  The bathroom counters should be clean with no clutter.  New towels on the racks, new rugs on the floor (unless old rugs are in good shape).  The kitchen should be spotless with clean counters (no appliances on countertop).  The dining room - some people like to set the table with china and crystal.  Some pictures I've seen make a staged dining room look like a department store with all the crap they put on the table.  I like to keep it simple and just use a nice centerpiece on a bare table.  You can put one or two decorative items in the bath and kitchen.  I like to use something colorful but not gaudy.  I like to use orchids in pretty pots.  They last a long time, no one is allergic to them and they look elegant.  I usually put one in the bathroom and then one in the living room or kitchen.  If you don't have enough furniture to do complete rooms, use a couple of representative pieces to suggest how the room would look with furniture in it.  I had a huge living room but not enough furniture to stage it.  I put a single sofa, two end tables, a coffee table and small desk in the room so the buyers could see how it might work with their furniture.  Clean all the windows until they sparkle and open all the drapes and shades.  People love houses with a lot of light.  The idea is to make the home clean, warm and inviting without tarting it up.  I sold a house about a year ago using these methods and got an offer that was $25,000 over list.  The ""professional"" stager my realtor hired was useless.  The only suggestion she made was a terrible one.  She wanted me to take the living room drapes down and just leave the shears.  We did it just to show her how terrible that would look and then we put the drapes back up."

Those are the days it is critical to keep the house staged every day. After that you should have a little more notice for showings and you'll be able to move things around as necessary.
RealEstate,3cnh3b,bohmoneybohproblems,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:00:34 2015 UTC,This is good info.  I've not sold a house before (we are a family of four living in a house a bachelor bought for himself) so I've no experience in this matter.
RealEstate,3cnh3b,lemon_tea,2,Thu Jul 9 19:10:38 2015 UTC,"I totally understand.  But this is what you have to do to get top dollar.  Yes, you do put everything in storage.  We actually put a lot of our boxes in our garage because it was just a garage.  Buyers don't seem to mind that.  We put extra furniture, sports equipment, etc. into storage.  We often used paper plates to eat to help with clean up because it really is a lot of work to keep your house this way.    I made liberal use of under the bed because nobody looks there.  I also kept plastic bins in every room so if I needed to get it cleaned up quick, I could just scoop stuff into the plastic bins, bins go into garage, done.  If you have small children, I think it would be okay to let one playroom type room be where the kids toys go.  You don't have to be as careful about keeping that room picked up because people understand playrooms, but it should still be really clean.  In a decent market with a decently priced house, you would probably only have to do this for a month.  Our house actually sold in one weekend (2012).  The house before that one sold in two weeks (2000).  If you can't go to this level, just get as close as you can.  I also made sure the buyers knew I was hiring a professional cleaning company to clean after we moved out.  It cost me $500 (big house), but it meant I didn't have to clean after moving and the buyers LOVED it."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,awhq,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:15:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for replying.  Our house will likely be on the market in a few months and it sounds like I'm going to have to send the wife and kids to live with family for a bit.  :)  Our house is a small, 3br @ 1200 sq ft.  There is literally no place that isn't in use in the house.  Every horizontal surface, every inch of counter space, every sqft in every room.  I'll probably wind up ordering a POD and loading it up just before I paint and kick everyone out.  And for sure on the cleaning company.  Once we're out, the carpets get cleaned and a team of maids will decend, and before we go in to the new place, same thing there."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,lemon_tea,2,Thu Jul 9 19:09:32 2015 UTC,"Instead of PODs, check out ABF U-Pack.  They bring you as many hard-sided containers as you want and they don't charge you for delivery and pick-up the way PODs does (at least in Chicago).  You use your own locks.  They drop them off, you can pack them up or they can arrange for someone to help you pack them (I hired two guys who packed up all the furniture and boxes for a 3600 sq ft house.  They charged me $600 for the guys.  Then they will store the pod and deliver it to you where ever you want.  I didn't have to store mine for any length of time, just a few days but, again, there was no extra charge."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,awhq,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:15:36 2015 UTC,"i guess i meant it as using cash to hire a designer, rent furniture, or making small, targeted improvements that increase the value of the home to make it more palatable to the general buyer."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,awhq,2,Thu Jul 9 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"I understood hiring the designer and rent furniture part.  That's the part I was responding to.  A ""stager"" is a designer who helps you arrange the furniture in your house so that it sells better.  Unless you have questionable taste (different from others in your area at your age), then I don't think it's necessary based my experience.  For targeted improvements - paint (replace non-neutral colors with neutral), clean or replace carpets, update baths, update kitchen and landscaping.  Most people can't afford to update their kitchens and baths.  In this case, painting cabinets and replacing cabinet hardware can go a long way.  For landscaping, make sure the grass is weed-free, lush, mowed, and edged.  Plant colorful flowering plants in the front.  I like hydrangeas because they are big and bloom all summer.  But none of that is relevant unless you clean and de-clutter first."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,SurgioClemente,4,Thu Jul 9 17:34:23 2015 UTC,"I think it would be hard to statistically quantify this.  Markets can change by 1.5% between 2 months (May to today).  Plus unless you are next door neighbors the location factor (among others) has to be accounted for   what kind of offers were you getting PRE staging versus what did you eventually sell it for POST staging?    This implies a home was on the market for a period of time, not getting offers (or they kind they wanted) and then decided to try something different.  How are you going to distill out the market % change vs the staging ROI?  Finally, don't think of it as 1.5% of the list price.  Factor in how much you owe the bank and closing costs.  Then look at your take home $ vs cost of staging, you are likely going to get a much higher %  All that being said, clean up your house, pick up the toys, and throw away junk :P"
RealEstate,3cnh3b,ky_ginger,5,Thu Jul 9 13:13:52 2015 UTC,"This is in Louisville, KY. Low COL area, hot market. It's ok to be jealous about what $500k will get you here ;)  We had a flip house last year that we put on the market right before Thanksgiving. I know, I know, worst possible time, but we didn't want to just sit on a $400k investment for 7 weeks until after the first of the year, plus if anything around here is going to sell at that time of year it's in this neighborhood. 4000 sf total, 4 bed, 3 ba, attached garage, .75 acre lot, best home schools in the county, highly sought after area of town, new roof and windows, original hardwood floors, completely redone from top to bottom, listed at $485,000. We had good traffic at the open house and a few other showings, but no offers. People were extremely confused as to what to do with a bonus living area off the kitchen (which was in addition to a large living room and also a huge basement living room/entertainment area), and also what we saw as an office area in the basement.  After the first of the year, we had a few rooms in the house staged with furniture and accessories for a cost of $2300. We also updated the listing photos with pictures of the rooms that now had furniture/staging in them. Within three days after the open house, we had competing offers and had the house under contract at full price of $485,000.  Yes, the time of year had something to do with it. But - we didn't change one thing about the house itself, just brought in staging in 3 rooms. The vast majority of people (aka buyers) cannot envision spaces like RE investors and designers/stagers can; you have to help them see it by putting an example right in front of them. What we paid for staging was .47% of our list price, and it was worth every penny.   We also had another house, literally two houses down from the one I just described, that we listed in early April of this year. This one was even nicer than the $485k house, open concept, and 400 sf bigger. We spent $3900 on staging, house was listed at $515,000 which was at the very top of the comps for the neighborhood. We listed it on a Thursday, had an open house Sunday, had competing offers the next day and by Tuesday it was under contract at full price. We closed in early June at the list price of $515,000. Staging was .76% of list price.  Those were the first and second houses we did staging in, and we budget for it on every house we've looked at since. However, we've been looking at, and usually do, homes that are not your typical ""flips"", meaning they're in nicer areas of town and are not turn-and-burn investments. If we were to do lower-end homes, say under $200k, that might be different.   Our agreed-upon approach now is that no matter what, if there's any room or space in the house that is the LEAST bit awkward - large but long and narrow, L-shaped, small patio, even just plain big - we stage it. Because people just can't use their imaginations, it has to be right there in front of them."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,GregInAtlanta,2,Thu Jul 9 17:31:34 2015 UTC,"that's fantastic information, thank you so much for all that!"
RealEstate,3cnh3b,ky_ginger,4,Thu Jul 9 17:50:42 2015 UTC,"For average folks with an average to above average home, staging makes little sense with mostly a negative ROI.    To put it bluntly, what you need to do to prepare a home for market is pretty much common sense.  If it isn't, there is tons of information available online or through a decent agent.    Staging is beneficial (in the basic sense) when w huge home is totally vacant (furniture).  Because of the volume of space, it does help to have some furniture and decorations brought in.  Otherwise, a buyer may not have a good sense of usability for the area, thereby decreasing the chance of an offer.  No one has ever failed to buy a home because the pictures weren't trendy enough."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,themeatbridge,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you that it's pretty much common sense.  However, you overestimate the level of common sense exhibited by the majority of the general population ;)"
RealEstate,3cnh3b,DelRMi05,2,Thu Jul 9 17:52:44 2015 UTC,"If you think you can get $50k more by spending $15k, the math on that is pretty easy.  Except, you know the saying a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush?  In this case, it's a bird in the hand being worth much more than 1.052 birds in the bush.  Who knows what could happen to the market, or the home, while you're futzing around with tchotchkes on the mantle.    Calculating ROI is next to impossible on an individual sale basis.  Staging is about presenting the home in the best possible light.  However, even in the best light, buyers may only want to spend $950k.  And the longer it sits on the market, the lower the perceived value of the home."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,Zel606,2,Thu Jul 9 13:33:32 2015 UTC,"There's different methods of staging or preparing a home for sale in different price ranges. The National Association of Home Stagers often uses the line: ""Staging a home is often less than your first big price reduction."" As an agent, I believe it helps your home sell faster, and a lot of the times for more money, but let's face it, there are many different ways to do this. My marketplace has a lot of different price ranges, so it's not uncommon for us to list a home in the $300,000-$600,000 range and then over a million on a different side of town. If we are talking about lower priced listings (relative to the marketplace) we recommend to our clients to make necessarily repairs, have the house freshly painted, and bring in a stager at our expense to help move furniture in/out of the house at, recommend colors, etc. It sometimes can get more intensive and we will recommend that actually doing over a bathroom (According to Zillow the best investment for your dollar) will benefit. It really depends on each listing and each individual client. For a higher end home it works a little differently. Instead of negotiations that are tight and where $5,000 makes up a larger percentage, it generally costs homeowners of luxury homes less to have a staging company come in with the perfect furniture in order to demonstrate a lifestyle. There's also virtual staging which we have done for new construction or vacant homes in which we will contract out a company that is essentially is really, really good at photoshop and showcases how a home looks with furniture. Believe it or not, it really makes a difference to have some furniture oppose to a vacant home because people can relate to the space better. To answer your question, our staged listings have always sold faster with the caveat that they were priced correctly. The answer is it totally depends and I'm sorry I can't be more specific but that's real estate."
RealEstate,3cnh3b,DCCWA,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"I've heard 1.5-3% ROI is common, I've also heard of more.  Most people I know who stage are in the fix and flip group and they always stage and swear by it.  They want to sell it fast and at top dollar, the longer it sits the more carrying costs they pay.  Staging also help the buyer visualize it as if they own it while keeping it clean and uncluttered enough for them to see the houses beauty."
RealEstate,3cpdo0,InfieldFlyRule,2,Thu Jul 9 18:26:12 2015 UTC,"The flexibility of terms is typically offset by cost.  You'd pay a higher monthly rate for an apartment where you can go month-to-month.  Offer something in exchange for more flexible terms.  Offer to pay $1,250 per month for a 6 month lease.  He keeps his model tenants, you maintain some flexibility, he feels good because you're paying a bit more.  Or, sign the year lease and suck it up and pay if you need to move (sometimes companies will cover this as part of relocation packages)."
RealEstate,3cpdo0,siminsez01,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"We recently did this. Make it clear that you have a much greater chance of sticking around for the full 12 and maybe beyond. Also make it clear that there's a small chance you'd buy, in which case it could still be almost the full 12 months. Then mention the smallest chance of moving  If you're good tenants, your landlord should be willing to take the risk to keep you on. Just emphasize you want to stay, and plan on staying, you just want the flexibility in case something comes up. When we took this approach our landlord was super happy to have us stay and agreed to the 60 days term to help both parties (30 days is much more flexible, but it protects him from lost rent potential and saves us from being forced to find a new place in less than a month)"
RealEstate,3cpdo0,same_flying_cow,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:05:51 2015 UTC,One issue with the 6  month lease is it puts you in the dead zone of winter rentals. The market for landlords gets much worse in Nov-March. I think the $1250 rent suggestion is a good one.

Is it a credit union?  regardless..You can get to the closing table tomorrow (honestly..if they pull a closing out of their ass i'd be speechlesS) and if the numbers are all fucked DON'T feel forced to close.  You walk right out of that office and right into an attorneys office.  Do not speak to anyone.  Request all documents from your agent and discontinue all communication.  Thats like.....terrible.  Have you spoke with your agent about this?  I want you to triple check the HUD-1 and make sure the closing agent is aware of the situation right away.  Tell them you need a LOT of explanation to ensure theres no bullshit happening.  If you catch a scent of BS...find the fucking exit.    God damnit.  If what OP is saying is true..that just continues the stereotype of our industry is a dumpster fire.
RealEstate,3cm0cr,alchemy3083,2,Thu Jul 9 04:56:10 2015 UTC,"So what was at the closing table, /u/jimsmisc?"
RealEstate,3cm0cr,lannister80,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:31:00 2015 UTC,"[repeated from above]  There is supposedly a GFE buried in some early paperwork (I have not yet located it, and don't know why they didn't mention it when I kept asking). We also did receive updated numbers about an hour before closing.   That said, I think my frustration (and borderline panic) was justified - the closing costs thankfully came in literally $30,000 less than the rough number they had sent by email last week. Keep in mind this is on a $500k house near a major city, so it's not some ridiculous mansion. Total closing costs came in just under $30k, so a difference of $30k was a 100% margin of error."
RealEstate,3cm0cr,icantrange,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:08:31 2015 UTC,"RESPA-defined loan application!  I'll remember to use that next time!  http://www.mortgagenewsdaily.com/channels/pipelinepress/08012013-mortgage-application.aspx   An application for RESPA means the submission of a borrower's financial information in anticipation of a credit decision relating to a federally related mortgage loan, which shall include the following: borrower's name, borrower's monthly income, borrower's social security number to obtain a credit report, property address, estimate of value of the property, and loan amount. Once you have these six pieces you have created an application per RESPA. An application may either be in writing or electronically submitted, including a written record of an oral application. We know that once this happens, there are required disclosures (Good Faith Estimate -GFE, HUD Booklet for purchase loans, Servicing Disclosure) and Recommended Disclosures (Required Provider Disclosure, Shoppable Provider Disclosure, for example. These disclosures are required within 3 business days after the receipt of the last of the 6 pieces of information, per the application definition.   On my last purchase, Quicken was the only place that refused to send a GFE.  Kept trying to get me on the phone, asking about what my other offers were.  Standard boiler room salesman shit.  The day I needed my GFE's together I got an Email from the guy at 1:50pm asking why I wasn't taking his calls.  I replied that I was busy looking at GFE's from my potential lenders and remarked that his loan was not one of them, and told him he had 10 minutes.  Remarkably, he put one together in half an hour, but of course late is late, and Quicken was well out of consideration by that point anway.  I have no idea what was going through this guy's mind when he processed my prequal, looked at the 800+ credit score, and decided, ""Yeah, here's a guy with few credit options, time to play hardball."""

I toured the property but I was out of town for work when the inspection was done. My realtor was there but I was not. I had no option to be there - I had a week inspection window and was out of town for two weeks. Perhaps I was an idiot for that, but I assumed that it would be covered, and my realtor didn't explain to me that it wasn't.  I was only expecting utilities to be covered because the listing explicitly said so. Otherwise I fully expect to pay utilities."
RealEstate,3clkc6,goosetavo2013,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:16:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, my inspector - my realtor referred him, I paid him, but I was not there (as I said in other comments, I was out of work for the entire inspection window.  I did read the HOA bylaws and all of that, it's what was given to me. This is my first house purchase, so I didn't know what else to ask for.  My agent has been sending me the correspondence between her and the other realtor, and the other realtor keeps backpedalling as though we had been misreading what she said. For instance, if the listing literally says ""Garage included"" but in the email the seller's agent said that was somehow a misunderstanding of us."
RealEstate,3clkc6,RideTheBeav,3,Thu Jul 9 13:19:37 2015 UTC,"I am really sorry about your situation.   I had assumed you did not have your own realtor. This is even worse,  your own realtor is really bad.    They trusted what the other realtor said without bowthering to check themselves. eg the HOA rules, the sq ft.  they employed a shitty inspector. Our inspector checked all the appliances.    The realtor is getting a lot of money. They did not do their job."
RealEstate,3clkc6,RideTheBeav,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm really disappointed in them for not helping me more along the way since I've never bought a house before. I thought I'd done as much research as I could but Google can help only so much. If I had been able to be around for the inspection either I would have checked the appliances or made sure the inspector did, but I didn't even know he didn't check them until after closing and I found out they were all broken."
RealEstate,3clkc6,goosetavo2013,9,Thu Jul 9 14:44:44 2015 UTC,"Did you have your own buyer's agent? They should have helped with due diligence here, you don't mention them. Looks like a lot of stuff in the listing was incorrect, that's not illegal but definitely a no-no with the MLS, complain to them and they will fine the agent or worse if they already have complaints. In WA state, these items are ""buyer beware"", if you don't investigate on your own, it isn't the seller's fault for not telling you. Sucks I know, but that's how it works and why you should always seek representation from your own knowledgeable agent. Cheers!"
RealEstate,3clkc6,paintmekev,0,Thu Jul 9 00:11:21 2015 UTC,"I do have my own agent, I'm pretty angry at her for not pointing any of this (meaning, that at least I have to check these things my self) out to me either.  I understand that it may be buyer beware, but is it their responsibility if they stated on the seller's disclosure that everything is in working order? If not, then I stand corrected."
RealEstate,3clkc6,SenorBrown,2,Thu Jul 9 13:24:00 2015 UTC,"In WA, unless you can demonstrate the intention to deceive ( good luck) its up to the buyer to figure this out during due diligence, in other words, buyer beware. Honestly, you and your Buyer dropped the ball here. You can try lawyering up but I'm not sure you will get too far: you had a chance to do an inspection, review all HOA docs, appraisal (which you have the right to receive a copy of and they always verify square footage), and missed all these things. Go after the listing agent for the incorrect info in the MLS, but not sure you can do much more. Cheers!"
RealEstate,3clkc6,lsop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:57:02 2015 UTC,"The inspection was done, but I was out of town so I wasn't able to be there to verify things. I did see the appraisal, and that's where I raised the questions about square footage, but the seller dismissed those completely. I should have taken that as a warning, but I knew I liked the place despite that one discrepancy. I received only HOA bylaws and rules, and didn't realize until this post that I should have gotten financial info from the HOA or anything else from them."
RealEstate,3clkc6,invertedblue,8,Thu Jul 9 16:30:08 2015 UTC,"Where was your broker during this process?    Square footage can almost always have discrepancies. Do you measure outside or inside walls? How do you measure utility rooms, balcony's, etc?  The garage issue should have come up either from your broker or from the title work when the property history is searched. Your broker dropped the ball on this one. You should have been given a period to review all HOA documents so your out of luck on this one. You should have been given all financials, meeting minutes, bylaws, declarations, budgets that would show what the association covers. You should have also been given an option to object and cancel the contract if you don't agree with them. Did you review these? You should have a remedy for this one. Did you get an inspection to clarify these were in working order? Did you do a final walk-through prior to closing?   I think you should have some options here but you need to speak to your broker and possibly an attorney. Bottom line, if it's only $600, suck it up and move on. In a year you'll forget about it and be happy in your new home!!"
RealEstate,3clkc6,lsop,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:26:26 2015 UTC,"There's no balcony or utility room - the stacking washer/dryer is in a tiny closet only about as big as the washer itself. I don't know if it means outside or inside walls, however. I agree that we should have checked on the garage, however the seller and seller's agent also should definitely not have stated in the listing that it was included. I was only given the bylaws and rules, none of the other paperwork. I wasn't even aware those existed. Yes, I should have done more research, I realize that now. I realize my realtor is at fault for not asking for them, as well as the seller's realtor for not providing them. As far as I can tell, the inspector didn't inspect the appliances, or at least they're not described on the inspection. I was out of town the entire window for an inspector, so he and my realtor were there for that and I wasn't. I assumed, apparently incorrectly, that the inspector should check the appliances."
RealEstate,3clkc6,wamazing,2,Thu Jul 9 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"It sounds like your broker did an awful job for you! They should have known to verify the sq. ft., the garage, the HOA and the inspection (since you were out of town). I would be upset with the Seller and their broker but your broker is the one who should have protected you from these items. Can you get any recourse from them?"

RealEstate,3clkc6,Realestateuniverse,4,Thu Jul 9 02:37:51 2015 UTC,It is absolutely standardized but running a tape measure can be inaccurate and adjusting for interior open space on multi level homes is also challenging. When in doubt go to the tax GLA.
RealEstate,3clkc6,BurningBushes2000,2,Thu Jul 9 05:49:38 2015 UTC,"This may vary from state to state, but in TX it is in no way standardized. I learned this the hard way several years ago. I had three separate appraisals done over a period of 10-15 years for our house that we were selling and there was a 250+/- discrepancy between each one. Some appraisers count stairs some don't. Some count closets, some don't count floor space under a sloped ceiling, etc, etc."
RealEstate,3clkc6,goosetavo2013,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:16:09 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't you have had the feedback from the appraisal far in advance of closing? The loan can't be finalized without it. In other words, you should have heard about the square footage discrepancy then."

RealEstate,3clkc6,silversquirl,4,Wed Jul 8 22:01:29 2015 UTC,Well....every argument has two sides.  How long has she been selling real estate?  Its possible her seller lead her by the nose and she didnt do her due diligence.  She could have easily just looked at the sellers disclosure for ALL of that information and could have pulled SqFt from tax records.  Its important to remember that MLS listings have no contractual recourse.  IF the agent is knowingly lying that's one thing and should be handled accordingly.  If she is simply filling in the blanks taking her scummy seller's word for it..that's another.  And at that point I would be talking to an attorney immediately about suing the sellers ass off.
RealEstate,3clkc6,dragon5bui,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:47:00 2015 UTC,"Fair point - if it was the seller's fault then of course I'll go after them and not the realtor. All things considered, it does seem like it's the realtor's fault, but I understand this needs to be looked into further."

RealEstate,3cnuz5,Snowblower93,2,Thu Jul 9 10:39:24 2015 UTC,"My guess is if the payoff line isn't mentioning it specifically the subsidy amount was either rolled into the payoff number its giving you or there is nothing owed.  One other thing I want to point out though is you state ""We are pretty much breaking even""  While it may be true you are not walking away with cash at closing, you did not break even on the house, as it sounds like you had already cashed out the equity with an equity loan. Doesn't change things, except from the perspective you didn't break even or lose money on the investment, you just simply cashed out early."
RealEstate,3cnuz5,Realestatehell,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:30:00 2015 UTC,I think you are right.  If I fudge the numbers and make the selling price higher the payoff goes up.  And you are correct I took the equity early.  Some more food for thought.  We purchased for $134k and are selling at $149k.  Our closing cost are $14k.  So in reality we are still even at 134+14=148.  We obviously paid some of this down and took the equity but I think this is why we arnt due subsidy.

Even then responses mainly don't work for the space or they are contacting me to discuss listing space/selling a property.    Personally I think its a waste of time and the amount of responses (if any) you get make this a very very expensive way to prospect.    This might work better for really small spaces where their are less gate keeper issues.  Anyone who can move a 15k sf office isn't opening the mail and the person who does probably knows nothing about if they are even considering moving.  This is going straight in the trash before anyone looks at it IMO.    How many of these are you sending out?

How much to park it in your lot?""  If they are seriously looking, they probably have a broker, or minimally are looking at loopnet etc.  If you are there, they know about you.    If you choose to do something like this, I'd actually contrast /u/b6passat a bit.  I'd skip mailing it to people like that, and mail it to every RE agent in the city with a big ass thing on the front that says $5k bonus for Tenant's Agent for a close deal, $1,000 for any submitted LOI and $100 for any property tour.""  It shouldn't, but that will get someones attention.    If you are just going straight to businesses, I bet the ROI on this is something like 5-10k per property tour and 50K+ for an LOI."

You will meet people who you can file away to reach out to later, once you get started in real estate."
RealEstate,3cmmn3,Mitchell-Goosen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:16:43 2015 UTC,I had a Zurple site a few years ago and did not have any closings in 6 months. Mostly my fault because I did not invest enough into the ppc budget. I now have a Kunversion site and spend $500 in ppc/mo. I generate about 80 leads per month between that and my zillow advertising.   I chose Kunversion because of the automation and backend crm features and the cost.   I would ask any of the companies for a demo and also whether they have a ppc management fee.
RealEstate,3cmkes,Kaikai19,2,Thu Jul 9 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"When I was buying my townhome the realtor told me the HOA covered everything but walls in. So essentially its a steel HOA fee but they repair the roof, siding and all yardwork. I spoke to an insurance agent about coverage and she tried to convince me to get normal homeowners to cover the townhome. I let her know the HOA covers everything but walls in and she changed the policy to condo.   So to answer your question: I don't know what your document is saying, but from my understanding if your HOA covers everything except walls in, its a condo policy. If it doesn't cover much then you'd get a normal homeowners policy."
RealEstate,3cmkes,Rabbidapple,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:17:57 2015 UTC,"Aka, op will need insurance. From the looks of this form, op will be getting homeowners insurance."
RealEstate,3cmkes,Miamihawks,2,Thu Jul 9 04:45:39 2015 UTC,"This is an umbrella policy,  you want h-06 for ""walls in"" as your personal policy.  The image you posted is referred to as a ""master policy""  or ""umbrella policy""  the following pages that aren't posted should describe every address covered in this umbrella,  this covers everything from the studs out,  when you get your h06 policy or ""condo""  policy it will cover everything that is ""walls in"" literally everything within the walls, just find an agent and give them your lenders phone number they can get the lender requirements for you rather easily,"
RealEstate,3cmkes,joserrific,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:58:00 2015 UTC,"This is correct. Some of the things you should be cautions of:  Subjugation- Get a policy that does not require that the Association open a claim before your policy comes in effect. Many carriers are including this clause now days and when the Board decides not to open a claim, you can't gt anything from your coverage, even if it is clearly covered in your policy.  Moving and temp. housing coverage- when the building gets tented or your neighbor starts a grease fire and causes smoke damage to the whole building and it takes their insurance 3 years to reimburse you for your 6 month motel stay (true story).  Coverage for improvements- to cover all the flooring, fixtures, and whatever else has been upgraded since the developer first sold the unit (because you can be about 95% sure that the governing documents don't cover this).  Sewer backups-  virtually no insurance companies will cover this for your type of HOA. Best to protect yourself in case you end up stuck with the bill.  Lastly, get your insurance agent to actually talk with the Association's agent and go over coverage and the governing documents line by line. Neither agents want to do this, but that is part of what they are paid for."

As the president of my HOA, I can tell you that Realtors, Loan Officers, and the HOA board members often get it wrong when telling people what type of policy they need."
RealEstate,3cmkes,zooch76,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"Can't see what the HOA is insuring (property-wise) with that certificate - the only coverage noted is Liability, not fire/property/hazard.  Couple ways things might pan out:   HOA provides a master policy that includes your unit interior, including any improvements/betterments/upgrades. In this case, you won't need insurance. You should maintain a unitowners policy for your personal liability, personal property (e.g. furniture, clothing, etc) as well as loss assessment. HOA provides a master policy that includes your unit interior, but excluding improvements. In this case, the HOA is insuring your unit ""as originally delivered"". So, if the original build of the unit had ash cabinets, formica countertops and cheap laminate flooring, and you replace with custom cherry cabinets, marble block counters and mahogany flooring, you're responsible for insuring the upgrades you've made (or previous owners had made). Again, a unit owner policy is called for, including some dwelling coverage, liability, personal property and loss assessment. HOA  provides a master policy, which only covers the building/shell, and not the interior. Also known as a ""Bare Walls"" policy. You are responsible for the entirety of the unit interior. If the place burns down, the HOA's policy will build you an empty shell of a condo - you have to rebuild the fixtures. Again, a unit owner policy is called for, including full dwelling coverage, liability, personal property and loss assessment. HOA provides no property coverage (or property coverage only for ""common elements"" such as sidewalks, fencing, lighting, etc). This happens sometimes with townhome-style condos, and should be reflected in the condo declaration. In this case, you're responsible for your portion of the unit, including exterior walls. You'll need a homeowner's policy, just as if you were buying a stand-alone single family home."

They also have some limits on how much of a house you can buy as well.   It has been challenging, but I would have other challenges to overcome with more traditional financing.    Do you possess a good about of patience and a can do attitude?   What is your work situation like ... if it's a simple W2 the process is much easier than self employed.    What is your timeline like. It's not a fast process.   If you have bad credit then it's probably one of your only options.

If you do try to prepay, try to spin it as a positive - maybe you can get them to discount the rent a bit since they'll be getting it upfront."

I would offer a healthy (refundable) security deposit, and to pay rent a month ahead. So when you move in you pay this month and next month's rent. In 30 days you pay the 3rd month's rent.   If your credit is OK and you are in a field where it's likely you'll find a new job, I bet you'll find someone to work with you.

RealEstate,3cl2vw,madfer,0,Wed Jul 8 19:41:03 2015 UTC,"As long as you have good credit , and it's your primary home, then yes. You must also leave some equity in the home to get the best rates (20%)  Just make sure you actually fix the place up, and hopefully you have lots of experience in this field.   A lot of fixer homes WILL REQUIRE cash only, because of the condition of the home. Otherwise you don't need to be a cash buyer to be competitive in even a fast market.

RealEstate,3cl2vw,ImJustAGirl14,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:07:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure if in all states, but in NC when you do your LTV mortgage, they are going to 80% you on whatever is lower, last sale value (if sold in the past year), or there appraisal.  This means you won't get any sweat equity or renovation monies back unless you can wait a year before you seek financing.  For example, you get a sweet deal @ 100k, and use another 50k to fix her up.  Bank does an appraisal and it comes out to 1 billion dollars!  They will still only finance you 80k unless the purchase was over a year prior."
RealEstate,3cl2vw,aardy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:11:56 2015 UTC,"When I tried to do this, there was a 6 month waiting period after buying a house for cash before you could apply for cash-out financing."

Recently, for example, there was a deal that was 136k purchase price, targeted repairs will be about 10-15k and it will appraise for about 185k.   Then, they can do delayed financing at 75% LTV and will get a mortgage for about 138k. Leaving them with out of pocket expenses of about 20k when all is said and done.   This will be bought with hard money although it's the same concept."
RealEstate,3cl2vw,SammyD1st,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:46:41 2015 UTC,My sister and I are both small time RE investors. I buy/rehab cash and generally hold long term. She buys/rehabs cash and does a refi after rehab. I've never seen her have a problem getting 80% of ARV mortgage. Her invesment properties are in Philadelphia (it may be different in your area). I'd talk to one or 2 banks in your area to see what their requirements and restrictions are for cash out refi. I doubt there will be a problem especially since it will be your personal residence.
RealEstate,3cl2vw,aardy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:48:19 2015 UTC,"Yes.  Look up the rules for the ""seasoning period"" - you want to wait the 6 or 12 months seasoning period so the new loan can be based on a new appraisal (higher) instead of your purchase price (lower).    Potentially, if you do the renovations right, 75% of the new appraised value is higher than your purchase price + rehab costs... thereby netting you more cash in your pocket.  You can get a normal conventional investment loan, for only slightly higher rate than an owner-occupied conventional."
RealEstate,3cl2vw,SammyD1st,2,Wed Jul 8 23:52:47 2015 UTC,Second person in this thread to say a cash buyer must wait 6+ months.   Is delayed financing to pull equity out in <6 months really like some sort of secret mystery thing?
RealEstate,3cl2vw,atl2ptown,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:22:31 2015 UTC,"No, you can do it - it's just that the value will be your purchase price, instead of the (usually much higher) newly appraised value after you fix it up.  That's with a conventional loan though.  You could always explore portfolio lenders too, they don't care about the seasoning period and can make their own rules for valuation."
RealEstate,3cl2vw,bozwood,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:00:33 2015 UTC,That is what I do on almost every deal. Cash makes life 10 times better for closing and rehab.   Getting loans on a good asset is cake.

RealEstate,3ckl8v,Mahmoud_Imadinrjaket,7,Wed Jul 8 17:15:28 2015 UTC,"I think it depends on your seller. An investor won't care who you are they just want the highest offer with the most assured financing. A family on the other hand may care.   My husband and I close tomorrow on our first house and we wrote a sappy letter. It was complimentary of the home and the home owners. Having gone through the multiple offers above asking game a bunch of times we'd learned to pay attention to who the owners are and try to appeal to them. Do they have kids in a local parochial school? Dog lovers? Bakers? Is it a close community where they want to make sure they give their neighbors good replacements? We looked for all of that stuff and then tried to mirror it in our letter (we also want the opportunity to send our future kids to parochial school! The kitchen is perfect to make my grandmother's chocolate chip cookies in!)  The seller's agent claimed they picked our offer over a slightly higher one because of our letter.  We got it for asking price and we're in a super hot LA market. There are examples on the Internet of letters, I used those to get an idea of what it can look like. We also included a picture of us to personalize it more."
RealEstate,3ckl8v,a_dog_named_Moo,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:29:50 2015 UTC,Great point and good idea to tailor the letter to them as much as possible.
RealEstate,3ckl8v,zooch76,5,Wed Jul 8 19:57:47 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  If there are two similar offers, the letter (and a family pic) could put you ahead, but it's not likely to beat out a higher offer.  You have nothing to lose by trying."
RealEstate,3ckl8v,junegloom,4,Wed Jul 8 17:59:52 2015 UTC,"It'll really depend on the seller. Plenty of them like that kind of thing. It was recommended to me to try that a few times, but ultimately I wasn't comfortable asking random strangers to care about my plight. Why should they? And if I was the seller, I'm too cynical a person to respond well to it I think. I figure if a letter is good enough to work, people would just start copying and using that same letter to get what they're after. Its just a tool being used for its effectiveness, none of it has to be true, they just want it to work. It seems manipulative and I don't like it. But lots of people are looking to be choosy about who they give a place to, no harm in trying."
RealEstate,3ckl8v,ky_ginger,3,Wed Jul 8 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"I think you've got nothing to lose by trying, and I've heard many situations where prospective buyers sent letters with their bids and won out amongst several competing bids. I agree with what someone else said, which is that it depends on your seller - it's very likely that, given similar offers, the one with the letter will be the one picked if it's a family/individual seller.  In fact, we just lost out on a house because of this - we were wanting it for an investment property, and despite putting in an all-cash, no contingency, no inspection offer - we lost out to an owner-occupant, because the seller was an elderly couple that had lived there for 30-40 years and raised their family there, and they wanted a family to move in and love the home just like they had."

Don't know, but the seller did wish is the best of luck with the house and told us how they were newlyweds when the purchased the house and we did beat out 5 other offers.  Did it cost much to do? About 10 minutes of our time.  I say do it, use those heart strings, it can't hurt.  And fyi I'm in a warm market too.  ( Pittsburgh)"
RealEstate,3ckl8v,SunknLiner,3,Thu Jul 9 01:21:31 2015 UTC,"Our Realtor asked us to include a personal letter that was ""slightly sappy, but that paints a picture of how you'll use, love, and care for the home"", the goal being to get the seller to visualize you as the owner.  It's important to emphasize how perfect the house is as-is, and how you'll always maintain and love ""their"" home - not detail what you'll change, or how it's the closest to perfect you've found so far.  Don't be afraid to tug on the heartstrings a little, but don't go so far that it comes off contrived.  Here's the one I drafted up as an example for you:   May 31st 2015  Dear <homeowner>,  Thank you so much for your generosity in opening your home to me and my wife today. Having lived in downtown Boston for a number of years where apartment showings are common, we certainly understand just how difficult it can be to have strangers entering and wandering about your home. I know that if someone was asking to purchase my family’s home, I would want to know a few things about them, and so I am writing you this note to tell you a little bit about us, and to ask you for your blessing.  My beautiful wife and I are newlyweds looking to buy our first, and hopefully forever home together. I am a new transplant to <location>, having recently left my position with the US Navy to join my new bride, a <location> native and a current doctoral student.  We visited roughly ten homes today, and I can honestly say that nine of them were just houses. Only one felt like a “home” to us – yours. As silly as it may sound, upon entering your home, we both nearly started to cry – partly due to the exhaustion of the day, but mostly out of relief that we had found “the one”! Everything about your home is perfect exactly the way it is – from the kitchen where I envision cooking many meals in the years to come, to the living room where I imagine our future babies will rabidly tear into their Christmas gifts, to the beautiful backyard where we hope to roast many marshmallows and get fat off S’Mores together. Even the windows were perfect, and just the right height for our three-legged cat, Handsome, to access and enjoy!  We truly loved your home, and as such would like to make you the following commitments: First, we promise to be the easiest buyers you’ll encounter. If you ever have any problems, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us – we want to make this easy, painless, and perfect. Second, we promise to love, respect, and care for your home for as long as we own it. Your home will never be any less loved.  Thank you again for your time today and for the time you are taking to consider our offer and read this letter. We truly hope that you will grant us the honor and the privilege of moving into the absolutely perfect home; not only for us, but our future family.  My wife and I are truly honored to have this opportunity,  SunknLiner   Ours was a very competitive situation, with our offer being the third made on the house in the same day.  We had the house under contract within five hours, and our Realtor is convinced that the letter was the tipping point."
RealEstate,3ckl8v,mrwoolery,8,Wed Jul 8 17:38:22 2015 UTC,"As a seller, if I saw that kind of letter, I'd read it as a negotiations weakness and ask for another better offer from them."
RealEstate,3ckl8v,mrwoolery,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:54:48 2015 UTC,Interesting.  Because it would make you think they want it so bad that they would shell out more for it?
RealEstate,3ckl8v,SunknLiner,3,Wed Jul 8 19:00:35 2015 UTC,"Yes.  It's a basic tenet of negotiations & supply/demand psychology.  If you see the demand rise, then you can raise the price."
RealEstate,3ckl8v,junegloom,3,Wed Jul 8 19:03:17 2015 UTC,"Well, it worked for me.  Guess I'm lucky you're not my seller.  We were already over asking anyway as asking price is more like a guideline in my market.  Here, houses sell within days, and almost never for below asking.  We offered $8k over with only $4k kicked back as closing assistance."
RealEstate,3ckl8v,mrwoolery,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't have thought of countering an offer that came with a letter, because letters are used as an alternative tactic fur buyers who can't make the top offer. Sending one basically states to me that they can't/won't pay more or what its worth, and are trying this angle instead."
RealEstate,3ckl8v,junegloom,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:15:44 2015 UTC,"...or an alternative tactic for buyers who can afford more, but are hoping to pull on the heart strings of the seller to sell at a more favorable price."

As for ways to figure this out, do you have his business card? Check his BRE number (each agent is assigned an ID number but that doesn't mean he couldn't be faking as another agent). Have you seen the property in person or did he open up the property for you? If you blindly gave your deposit to him without seeing the property, that could raise a red flag. I find it strange he asked only for security deposit but not for the 1st month rent as well. Usually when I do leases, I ask for both rent and deposit to make it easier for the landlord. Have you been to the agent's office? Have you tried calling the number/agent back?  I've seen scams happen with rentals all the time. People see some great deal and call the number. ""landlord"" says hes out of town but if you send him the money, he'll send a completed contract and keys for you to move in. You send check and never hear back from the guy.

If you have extra money to spend on improvements, but don't plan to sell in the next few years, I'd either hold onto that money for later or spend it on improvements/maintenance that benefit you in the near term. Things like taking care of items that are in need of maintenance (don't redo the roof if it's fine - wait for it to start showing it's age) will help preserve your asset for the long term. Things like adding that extra bathroom you've always wanted will give you added enjoyment.

RealEstate,3cjfog,Onearmedash,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:11:24 2015 UTC,"There's no trick. The best thing is to ask owners of the property you are looking at (avg AC or heating costs), that can be misleading unless you share similar lifestyles/habits.  I think looking at your existing bills will probably be the most useful thing you could do. If you currently spend 100 on your power bill, expect to spend about 100 at the new place; of course running full house AC is expensive but not prohibitively.   FWIW the best cost savings I've found was switching all the incandescent lights to CFL or LED.

Yes its under my control but I would like to continue to have my temp set to 76 and not 80 to try and make my energy bill the same as before. I am trying to get an idea for how much more.

RealEstate,3cjqs7,Humpt,7,Wed Jul 8 13:22:55 2015 UTC,"The number one thing you need to know is that 0% downpayment does not equal ""free house."" There will still be deposits, closing costs, your moving expenses, and the inevitable things that need to be repaired or replaced after closing. It saddens me to deal with veterans who think they can buy a house despite having almost nothing in the bank.  The number two issue is that your offer will be automatically less competitive than an offer with conventional financing. No, it isn't that sellers hate our veterans. VA loans come with some strings attached that are designed to protect you. These include strict property condition requirements (which some sellers can't meet) and some fees you aren't allowed to pay (guess who usually ends up paying them?). If your market is at all competitive, this can mean the difference between an accepted offer and a rejected one.  Good luck and thank you for your service."

I think mine was close to 4%.  Understand the concept of seller assist.  You can have the seller pay for a portion/most of the closing costs.  This all depends on the market, but I got the seller to cover 3% of my offer in closing costs.  Say you offer 150K with a 3% seller assist.  This means the seller will pay $4,500 of your closing costs.  It takes money out of their final check to pay for it...you may have to increase the offer to get assist.  The benefit of seller assist is that you basically bundle your closing costs into your mortgage instead of having to pay for it all at closing.  Let me know if you have any specific questions.  I thought that process was neat."

IMHO, VA loans are great if that's all you can get, but a conventional or FHA loan are usually much easier to work with and generally preferred by lenders, buyers, and sellers as they are much more straightforward for all parties involved.  /u/ShortWoman covers some of the pitfalls/concerns quite well.  It's also important for people to know that just because you can get a loan with zero down, doesn't mean you should (it also doesn't mean that you can afford it) and jumping on a zero down option can be quite shortsighted."

Just take your Certificate of Eligibility to a reputable loan officer and they will take care of you.  zooch76 is right though about looking at your other options.

We first started the process with a mortgage broker, who I believe had no idea what they were doing in terms of va loans. After 4+ months of dealing with them we decided to switch to a company who specializes in VA loans. We used Veterans United. I have to say they made the process almost too easy. Though I'm sure other companies are awesome as well. Just shop around.   I'd say the number one think is to make sure you don't have anything ""fishy"" going on with your finances. Like random large cash deposits. They want proof of everything. We were given a gift from a family member and it was a bit of a headache.   Also, any home you purchase with a VA loan needs to be in pretty good shape. They won't approve a big fixer upper.   If you can, purchase before November.

RealEstate,3cjqs7,pnwmommy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:25:47 2015 UTC,"My husband and I just closed on our first house with a VA loan in KY about 3 weeks ago. I would recommend looking for a lender that is familiar with VA loans, it will make the process much easier as there are some extra requirements they will need to be aware of. It may be the case that your offer is less competitive to some sellers, but we did not experience that.  The VA does their own appraisal and looks for the house to meet certain standards (in addition to the price) and they can be picky. Ours almost got held up right before closing because the VA appraiser had an issue with the way the HOA documents were worded regarding the private road the property is on. So if the house is not already in good condition, it will be harder to get VA approval.  I'd be happy to answer any more specific questions. Good luck!"

What's the protocol on how many times I can view it, and who should I bring upon each viewing?    Bring whoever you want as long as the number of people and of showings is within everybody's schedule.  Reason #4 not to call the listing agent.  A buyer's agent is much more patient about this and you can talk freely about pricing strategy/ reno/ et al without the LA around.   Do I make three visits, each w an electrician/plumber/hvac technician? Do I make one subsequent trip to the house with an inspector or GC?   Whatever you can swing with the agent."

I imagine that will result in a total grab bag of realtors, but I want the ideal realtor.   A Google search is a crap shoot.  Ask someone who already invests in that market to recommend someone.   If you don't know anyone else or can't find anyone you like, it's time to hit the pavement.  Go out and meet a few.  This means either hitting the offices that get the most listings and interviewing agents there or cold calling (or e-mailing) ones that specifically advertise that they work with investors/ flippers/ et al (whatever your situation is).  All of them are going to sell you on themselves.  However, when you ask about the other agents in the office that can help, a small subset will stand out.   I know I can just talk to people and start talking to general realtors, but I don't want to get stuck with realtors who try to hold out their services rather than point me in the direction of someone that is the best fit for me.

RealEstate,3cgftq,jack14911,12,Tue Jul 7 18:41:25 2015 UTC,"Appraiser with a CA assessor here. Your assessed value can only go up 2% per year or from new construction. If you're doing interior work and it's generally remodeling and NOT substantially rehabilitating (eg all new piping, floors, drywall etc), then those are typically not assessable events. Replacement/remodel are not assessable in CA. New bathrooms and living area are, but your whole house is not re-assessed - just the value of the addition. Like your new deck you mentioned - that should get you an increase in assessed value which should be close to the cost to build that deck."
RealEstate,3cgftq,bluelion24,3,Tue Jul 7 20:50:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for this information!  The deck is actually for a replacement for a deck that was condemned by the city.  I was forced to tear it down instead of replacing it.  Would that still be assessable, or would that be considered replacement?"
RealEstate,3cgftq,bluelion24,3,Tue Jul 7 23:04:13 2015 UTC,"You're welcome!  The answer to that is most likely yes, it's assessable. It has to do with whether or not your purchase price 2 years ago accounted for the deck ( i.e. Did the deck have value when you purchased the house, or did you know you'd have to tear it down?).   If purchase price assumes the deck has no value, then the new deck, even though it's replacement, is still assessable. But if you bought the house assuming you could use the deck and found out it's condemned and have to replace it, then that's not assessable."
RealEstate,3cgftq,DialMMM,2,Tue Jul 7 23:38:46 2015 UTC,"Thank you again.  The deck was condemned after I bought the house, so it was completely unexpected.  So hopefully that means I won't get reassessed for anything, but given my luck that just won't happen..."

RealEstate,3cgftq,jmizzle,7,Wed Jul 8 01:04:21 2015 UTC,"Really good question, actually, that has a somewhat disappointing answer.  Your example is like direct pairs. In areas I work, a pool might cost $60,000 to build. A house in that area may sell for $500,000 without a pool, and an identical next door house may sell for $530,000 with a pool. Technically, the market value for the pool is $30,000 because that's what it added to the theoretical sale price. However, because doing that kind of analysis is very lengthy and also because finding those exact matches can be difficult to not only find but also to prove reliabile, it's almost always the cost to build that gets enrolled, which, in this case, is the $60,000."

The problem with having unpermitted work is that an appraiser will not consider it in their appraisal. So while a 4th bedroom can fetch an extra $400k+, if it's not permitted the buyer will have an appraisal for a 3br place. Which means that you can't have a 4 bedroom bidding war, as all bidders must be able to bring the cash differential out of pocket."

But the GSEs have been successful at forcing buybacks on loans based on this (which is ridiculous because not having a permit never caused anyone to miss a payment....). So now lenders are taking a hard stance and not issuing loans on homes with non-permitted spaces. You may find it difficult or impossible to sell or refi someday, if you've done major work without a permit. I'm not sure about replacing doors or windows, I doubt that would raise a red flag. But major structural, electrical, or plumbing work will likely have someone asking for permits."

My (very experienced) lender said it was no problem. My realtor also didn't care.  The appraisers simply don't consider an extension if it's not permitted.

They can handle everything you need and should be able to provide the state-specific forms.   The nice thing about paying cash for land is that you can do as much or as little due diligence as you want, you don't need to buy title insurance if you don't want to.   Obviously, its in your best interest to look for liens/mortgages and to confirm that the seller owns what they're selling.  I've bought land and mineral rights before just using the mail. It helps to have a quick agreement sketched up to get through the transaction, but basically, I mail them the deed, they sign it and I wire funds to their account.  The local title company can record it for you, or you can just call the local county recorder find out about fees and mail them the deed with a check and they'll send the recorded deed back to you.  It's really pretty simple, way easier than buying a house.   That's my $.02,  obviously not legal advice, but I assume you wouldn't be here if you were asking an attorney.  good luck!"

And I can almost guarantee there are issues hiding if someone is: (a) not paying their taxes; and (b) willing to let the property go for cheap.    Even if there are no issues who is going to prepare your deed?  How do you know it's in proper form?  Does it meet local recording requirements (if any)?  Have you properly calculated and will you pay the right Documentary Stamp Tax?  Do you know where to record the Deed?  Does your deed convey all of the seller's interest in the property, or just part of it?  Is the seller delivering any warranties with the deed, or is it 100% buyer beware?    Once you have the property, will it be suitable for your intended purpose?  Are there deed restrictions?  Pesky easements?  What about zoning restrictions?

In Texas, if you buy new construction, there is an empty lot next door, ready for a potential buyer to build their own home, customized to their desires, and needs. Why pay the same price for a used home? The extra cost to the buyer is the delay for construction i.e. opportunity cost for waiting 6-9 months."

Real estate costs money to sell (realtors, laywers, title transfer) so consider that as well.    Your home is not worth as much as when the builder built it as soon as he's done building it, but it will be worth more as long as the neighborhood appreciates.

But just to add from a different perspective, for me, there is actually some intangible value in a used home. Things like knowing that the roof hasn't leaked/sagged for 30 years, the basement stayed dry, the foundation stayed put, etc. gives you a pretty good idea that you will never have a problem with those things (not counting neglect.) New houses are far from immune to major issues.  Couple this with the fact that houses don't wear the same way that cars do over time, I don't think you're comparing apples to apples. Plus, older homes can have character that new cookie cutters can't match. Of course new houses have advantages, I just don't think a used house is ""used"" in the same sense as most things we purchase."

Real Estate historically increases in value. Where you will see an issue, is with supply and demand. If you purchase in a sub-division for example, and there are plenty of newer houses popping up, your house will be the last to sell if you put it on the market again right away. Eventually, once the development is complete, all of the units will be roughly the same value (if the same model) varying in cost for condition and what the market is doing. I am in Greater Boston and there are not many sub divisions. In our case, a newly constructed property will sell for a premium as you move closer to the city. Going an hour or so out west and there's a lot more units that are newly constructed which keep prices down for a specific type of property."
RealEstate,3cf3rx,DelRMi05,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:42:26 2015 UTC,"Are the builders selling lots pre-construction for custom built homes or are the builders developing an entire neighborhood on spec and then selling the finished homes?  Either way, you will make more money to do what the builders are doing, instead of buying what they are selling."
RealEstate,3cf3rx,mrsmetalbeard,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:35:02 2015 UTC,"Assuming you built to your neighborhood's general standard (and not significantly above), then there should not be immediate depreciation.  A lot of people do not want the hassle or wait of building their own home, but at the same time, many want really new homes (<5 years) with modern (read: currently in-style) finishes, layouts, etc.  At least in our area, we were considered really strange for not wanting a ""new"" house, though building is a more unusual choice."
RealEstate,3cf3rx,vengeance_pigeon,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:46:29 2015 UTC,"One point that people are not mentioning is the price for ""extras"".  You will be paying for every little thing and the costs will go up.  You will pay for door handles, light switches and more.  And all of these costs will go up.  It will cost you thousands in little things you need to make the house functional."
RealEstate,3cf3rx,YouWillRememberMe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:46:42 2015 UTC,"IMO, yes, since you've customized it to what you want. Also, houses depreciate and people often ignore this. Your decor and utilities are slowly becoming out of date if you buy a house that is new or remodeled.  If you buy a house that ""needs cosmetic work,"" there is much less value to depreciate."
RealEstate,3cf3rx,catjuggler,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:29:44 2015 UTC,"In general, no, homes do not depreciate the way that cars do. The product and the market are completely different. It is possible though. One tangible example I can think of is if, for instance, the developer goes broke and leaves unfinished homes and empty lots and, say, promised a community building and never delivers. That kind of thing does happen, but as a general rule real estate is thought to hold and slightly increase in value with exception given for long term wear. Short term depreciation isn't really a concept in real estate, and in a hot market the idea would be a little absurd."
RealEstate,3chpw9,wuziwu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:16:16 2015 UTC,"No one can predict how the markets will go. Everyone has opinions.   If you buy the property for personal use, you get a $250,000 capital gains tax exemption on the sale of the property and the mortgage interest tax deduction if you take out a loan on the property.  For the rental property, you can deduct repair expenses from your gross income."
RealEstate,3chpw9,EnderWiII,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:16:30 2015 UTC,Are you paying cash or financing?
RealEstate,3chpw9,hankford87,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:01:51 2015 UTC,Financing mostly.

They're going to qualify you using 45% of your monthly income minus any monthly debts (student loans, car payments, credit card payments etc.)  With an investment property you're looking at 20-25% down and you'll 6 months of PITIH in your bank after closing costs and down payment.  You're also looking at a higher interest rate and investing out of state means you'll want to hire a management co. That'll charge you between 5% - 12.5% of your estimated gross income.  Definitely consult with a mortgage broker first but what I mentioned above has been my experience.  *phone grammar"
RealEstate,3cgm01,FlyingLap,3,Tue Jul 7 19:23:51 2015 UTC,"These are good ideas, but don't set out trying to revolutionize the industry or you'll burn out fast. A lot of your first year will be working very hard for the few clients that you have.   You've got to build for a while for a lot of your online stuff to be effective. Look at the top agents in your area- probably half of their websites are terrible. This is because some of them don't need it- real estate is still a personal business that is largely fed by word of mouth and shaking hands. Once you've been out there for a while and your name is well known, then your online presence will be a big help, but not before."
RealEstate,3cgm01,wastelandavenger,2,Wed Jul 8 04:37:19 2015 UTC,"It's going to vary on what is going on with your local market. I am in Greater Boston where my social media consists of the usual statistics and market updates. I often posts pictures of interesting things during showings or home inspections and that draws the most amount of attention. Agents that are extremely successful with it generally offer something of great value. For some, it's using a community page to share news and events. For others, it's photos from your area. original content of course. For others, they have organized neighborhood or town-wide yard sales. People are inundated with crap a lot of the time, so I find the best content original, and things people care about. Either way, be consistent and offer something unique."
RealEstate,3ci49q,gypsycabcompany,5,Wed Jul 8 02:15:44 2015 UTC,"I just did this after not quite 3 years in our house, and here's how it went: 1. Called the lender and asked what I had to do to get rid of PMI based on appreciation. 2. Faxed them a letter stating that's what I wanted to do. 3. Filled out a form to pay for an appraisal.  The bank initiates the appraisal but does not contact the appraiser directly. 4. Waited for the bank to schedule an appraisal. 5.  Walked around the house during the appraisal with the appraiser and answered any questions she had. 6.  Waited for a response from the bank.    In our case, the appraisal went better than we'd hoped and there was much less paperwork than I'd expected.  PMI's gone next month.  Call your lender and ask.  Good luck!  *edit: Modified #3 to reflect landofmisfits' appraiser info."
RealEstate,3ci49q,newredditsucks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:27:01 2015 UTC,I could hug you for your simple answer! Did you feel wary letting them hire one as opposed to you getting on and sending that information? I am always so wary of a banks intentions sometimes
RealEstate,3ci49q,landofmisfits,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:31:57 2015 UTC,"A  bank won't honor your appraisal, they will require their own.  Banks and appraisers are no longer allowed to communicate directly, so there should be no issue using the appraiser that the bank hires, it is all basically done blindly now."
RealEstate,3ci49q,newredditsucks,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:55:27 2015 UTC,I think I knew that deep down. Haha
RealEstate,3ci49q,landofmisfits,1 point,Wed Jul 8 11:58:10 2015 UTC,How does that work?  Is there some sort of appraisal bureau that the bank contacts and then that organization sends out the appraiser?
RealEstate,3ci49q,ky_ginger,2,Wed Jul 8 14:26:21 2015 UTC,"Pretty much, not a bureau, but the bank contacts a 3rd party who arranges and quality controls the appraisal, then sends it to the bank.  The bank doesn't know who is doing the appraisal until it is already done."
RealEstate,3ci49q,ky_ginger,2,Wed Jul 8 14:38:21 2015 UTC,"The requirements for removing PMI can vary by lender, say 75% LTV. Figure out what you need your house to appraise for, based on the balance left on your loan, in order to get to that ratio. If you think that based off of very similar homes selling that much above what yours appraised for at purchase- yes, I'd say it's worth it to order an appraisal through your lender."
RealEstate,3ci49q,aardy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:35:15 2015 UTC,I will speak with my dad about an appraisal order. He does mostly commercial but works with a few single family home appraisers.
RealEstate,3ci49q,aardy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:21:31 2015 UTC,"You will most likely need to do it through your lender for them to accept it. I'd check with them first before ordering anything independently, you may find you get stuck paying for another one anyways. This information is usually on your lender's website."
RealEstate,3ci49q,mrsmetalbeard,2,Wed Jul 8 13:29:04 2015 UTC,"Two ways to remove PMI:   With the loan servicer's permission, typically once you reach 20% equity based on the purchase price. Refinance to a new loan without PMI, once you have 20% equity based on a new appraisal evaluating current market value.   For the latter, you don't go pick an appraiser and have it done yourself. It will be done through your new lender."
RealEstate,3ci47f,digerati1338,2,Wed Jul 8 02:15:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, it's possible. I don't know if it's practical.  So for example: my county has a total of 833k dwellings. Just over 3k changed hands last month, between 25-30k all last year. What are the odds that The Perfect Home For You within a mile of a particular intersection was available for a price within your budget?  To pull this off, you must be patient, you must have a decent budget, and you can't be picky about anything other than location.  Good luck!"
RealEstate,3ci47f,ShortWoman,2,Wed Jul 8 05:08:44 2015 UTC,"We're in a similar situation and we're planning to send letters to the addresses that we're interested in to see if it will motivate someone to sell to us.  We're are also aware that if someone does want to sell to us, we will most likely have to do a lot of renovation to make the house work for our long-term needs. We would basically paying for the land/location and we will work on the house after that.  We probably will end up paying over market value, but if we find a house in the perfect location, but we're ok with not getting a ""deal""."
RealEstate,3ci47f,ImJustAGirl14,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:38:35 2015 UTC,"It worked for me when I wanted to be on a couple blocks on a specific avenue. I had to look for many months, and it was a desirable area to begin with, so I generally had to write an offer the day I saw a place if I wanted a chance to get it.  One other thing that helped was I picked a buyer's agent who lived on the street and would hear about folks selling their house well before they were listed. I don't know if that's possible for you but it definitely helped that she knew the age and long term plans of pretty much every homeowner on the street."
RealEstate,3ci47f,JorgJorgJorg,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:10:57 2015 UTC,"Find the agent who ""farms"" the area. They will be consistently on the for sale signs and doing open houses there. They can set up an mls search where any new listings get emailed to you immediately.    Fwiw set up any search parameters to be very wide. Not all agents will enter mls info correctly or accurately.  So you don't want to miss out on a possible good match because the size or number of rooms was listed incorrectly."
RealEstate,3cgl5u,14603throwaway,8,Tue Jul 7 19:18:01 2015 UTC,"If you are subordinating the second, the lender needs to see the terms to make sure there is no prepayment penalties or a balloon inside of 5 years.  Fannie won't allow a subordination in either of the cases.  The note is the only document that has that info.  It is in the paperwork when you signed the second mortgage but yes the credit union has it as well  Edit: I saw you are subordinating a Heloc in which case there is no actual note but there is a document that outlays the terms of the heloc.  What you supplied them should work, I would escalate the manner if possible.  That may or may not work depending on the lender"
RealEstate,3cgl5u,wescoe23,0,Wed Jul 8 02:09:47 2015 UTC,"For the love of god OP, listen to this person. What they gave you is your credit union's HELOC version of a note."
RealEstate,3cgl5u,tittypuncher,2,Wed Jul 8 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"Two things come to mind.  First, you may want to see of you can get around the copy of the note by providing a recent statement.  With that, your bank should be able to send over a ""written verification of mortgage"" to get around their underwriting conditions.  Secondly, are you only refinancing the first loan and leaving the second loan in place?  If the credit union can't come up with a note on record, I would speak with a real estate attorney to get their opinion on if the credit union even has a valid second lien on your property.  Not saying it's the right thing to do, but the credit union may not have legal grounds to collect payment on the debt....just a thought."
RealEstate,3cgl5u,Royal1k,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:27:48 2015 UTC,"My first thought it, you have no note? I make no payments.   Skip a couple payments and I bet they find it.   Did a title company handle your purchase? I'd call them, unless you want to roll the dice that the note was never recorded. In my area, these are public records and can be located in the recorded docs for my county. But that's not true in all areas.   Credit unions are regulated by local banking officials and higher, on a federal level. But before you go complaining (and admitting you owe a balance to them) you might want to run this past a real estate attorney and find out of they think you should keep making payments or not. Might be your lucky day!"
RealEstate,3cgl5u,wamazing,5,Wed Jul 8 01:05:49 2015 UTC,Skip a couple payments and I bet they find it.   Don't do this.
RealEstate,3cgl5u,DCCWA,0,Wed Jul 8 01:43:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah that needed a tongue-in-cheek avatar.   I'd ask an attorney about it though. Can't foreclose or put a lien on the house with no note.   This I really WOULD do: I'd call them up and let them know that I won't be making any payments since they can't find the note, and will be getting an attorney to represent me and get this debt squashed. You want to get their attention at the highest level. I would continue to make my payments, if it takes a while to get straightened out, but I'd let them know I'm at least considering not making them."
RealEstate,3cgl5u,wamazing,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:01:01 2015 UTC,"Option 1: Check with escrow/attorney that did the original closing. They should have a copy of the document in question.  Option 2: Take all paperwork you have. Send to a real estate attorney to review. Find out what is actually going on. Talking to a bunch of different banking people will just get you the run around and more confusion, they aren't trained or qualified to handle things like this. Pay someone a few hundred bucks to sort it out and save you the massive headache.  Option 3: There is absolutely an easy work around for this issue. There are a number of different documents and methods that would suffice. The refinancing party doesn't absolutely need the original note. The problem is it sounds like you are working with some bank drones just checking off boxes. ""We need this document"", ""Similar but not exact requested document available"", ""ERROR SHUTDOWN"". This is why I encourage people to use a good mortgage broker. They are generally much better trained, more nimble, and can get issues like this handled quickly.  What documents actually show up in the county records?  I wouldn't assume the credit union is being derelict at this point.  Are you absolutely sure you got a 2nd mortgage? Neither you, nor the other party seem to have a copy of a note. There are various different junior loan type products out there often all lumped together in the ""2nd mortgage"" category somewhat inaccurately. HELOCs are often documented as Agreements instead of Notes.   Finally let this be a lesson in reviewing, understanding, and keeping track of all important documents."

Remember that even the money you do use for qualified expenses is still going to be taxed at your highest income tax bracket, so ballpark 30% for state and federal, meaning you're going to incur an extra tax bill next April for ~$1330. (I'm assuming this was a traditional IRA since you did not say Roth.)  Now, if you keep more of that money you'll be paying an extra 10% penalty, losing damn close to half of what you withdrew. I would try to stuff as much back into the IRA as I could. You'll have to talk to an accountant or the IRS about how to do that."

RealEstate,3cgva7,JJWoolls,7,Wed Jul 8 00:48:33 2015 UTC,"As someone who lived in China for years and spent quite a bit of time in rural areas, I would advise against this, for a couple reasons:   If it's doable at all remotely, it will be very difficult You cannot ""own"" property in China. You just buy a 70-year lease. What happens after those 70 years, no one knows, because the government hasn't existed for that long yet.  If you live outside China but wish to spend time in rural Yunnan from time to time, why not simply rent? This would be far easier, far cheaper, and carries no risk of regulatory issues or loss of property if the government dissolves and/or just decides to become actually communist again and take all the land back.  If you're doing this remotely you'll need help from some kind of Chinese proxy or lawyer, etc., and the chances of you being scammed are pretty high unless you already know someone you trust deeply (like a family member). But if you knew someone like that you'd be asking them, not asking here.   Also, if you don't mind my asking, how much time have you spent in rural China? It can be very beautiful, but like...are you cool with dirt floors, no plumbing, and shitting into a hole? Because that's rural China 101.   That said, if you are going to do this, listen to /u/NumNumLobster . Get a US-based lawyer who's familiar with Chinese property transactions and do whatever he says.

It's very uncommon for foreigners to spend time in rural China, and it's not like the US where there's some web platform that has rental listings. I know of a few web platforms with online listings but (1) they're only in Chinese and (2) the offerings in rural areas are very slim.   Your first step might be to find the names of some rural towns/villages in Yunnan you think might be good. That would make searching for potential rentals at least slightly easier"

If a person can't get a good landlord reference it isn't my place to play detective and figure out who is right and who is wrong. I think you would be exposing yourself more by trying to dig into it.  In this particular case, wouldn't the previous landlord have known they were renting to ""a person with kids and a minority"" when the lease was signed? Did they suddenly become discriminatory by the end of the lease?"
RealEstate,3che3b,bjam2,2,Wed Jul 8 00:31:10 2015 UTC,"he alleged the landlord recently acquired the property.  I told him I rent to anyone who meets the qualifications and he is more than welcome to come look and fill out an application, but I wasn't going to speculate on something like that until I had a complete application and saw what reference was actually given.    I thought this would be an interesting discussion.  I have had landlords tell me ridiculous shit before that made me disregard their references.    I agree digging is bad.  If they want to make an allegation like that I think it would be on the tenant to provide some proof such as a pending fair housing lawsuit or other documentation that would make me believe them.    Everyone always has a story like you said, but if at some point it becomes clear to you that they were wronged I think you wind up in a pretty dicey situation.    my guy didn't show up for his appointment so he is dead to me anyhow, but like I said I think its an interesting question.  I see a lot of landmines there no matter how you handle it.  I really have no interest in playing detective, but think you can probably go too far the other way too if you don't at least hear them out and accept it if you have some compelling proof."

RealEstate,3che3b,ShinyLightning,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:55:39 2015 UTC,Whether or not you are committing a fair housing violation by denying an applicant based on them being a victim of a previous violation and if you have any responsibility to even  make a determination if you are doing that.  So in my example is there an argument of denying someone for being in a protected class or is it simply denying for lack of a reference.  There is a world of gray area there
RealEstate,3che3b,ShinyLightning,2,Wed Jul 8 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"So not many people know this, but a homeowner, acting as their own property manager & only managing one property of a four-plex or less, not listing the property on any MLS, may actually discriminate freely against protected classes legally.  I understand I'm opening up a whole can of worms here, so make sure you google Fair Housing Act legal exemptions before you put my head on the chopping block. In your example above, the landlord may have been acting completely within the letter of the law. I'm not saying it's right, or, in my book, ethical, it pretty much makes him an asshole in my book, but he may have done nothing illegal.  To your point, is there only one reference available? Because that's not enough in my book to approve a potential renter. I would want to know if the noise issue was a fluke or a trend. Insufficient verifiable rental history is enough in my book to deny an applicant."
RealEstate,3che3b,aardy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:59:24 2015 UTC,"well in that situation, if the last landlord openly admits that is why he ended their tenancy I think you'd be really fucked if you denied them.    That would be a really interesting circumstance.    None of their protections would extend to you, unless I'm missing something?    I require a few years of references.  if you move 3 times in 3 years and all are positive I am not particularly happy about that but I'm not going to hold it against you.  If you live at the same place for the last 10 years and that is your only reference I don't really care about that either.  When you start going past 3 years, at least in my experience, it becomes hard to contact past landlords.  Particularly if they were renting from individuals."
RealEstate,3che3b,aardy,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:04:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, no, if you're an agent leasing a property on behalf of a landlord, there is no exemption from FH laws there.

The rules for using the term ""realtor"" are silly and people mispronounce it all the time...that does not go well with my business model of reducing friction and confusion for the consumer.  As for finding agents, 1) I would ask them what their process is for finding you a home. You have to agree that it makes sense (don't just agree to a test drive) 2) ask how they communicate with clients. many agents seem to drop off the planet and not return calls or emails. By the way, if you like text but the agent hates it...not a good match. 3) Great agents ask a lot of questions and do not give canned answers. You should do most of the talking and if you can't get a word in....bad sign.  Agency (your buyer's agent question) is a tough subject. Any agent CAN represent you but you may not want them to. DO NOT AGREE to dual agency. In dual agency, the agent can only perform ""ministerial acts"" which are little more than admin tasks. They can NOT offer advice. They can NOT help negotiate. They can NOT use ""judgment or discretion"" when performing tasks on your behalf. So much is wrong with dual agency...dont do it!"

RealEstate,3cfmqd,Bekabam,3,Tue Jul 7 15:19:08 2015 UTC,"Having a large cash gift from family for use as a down payment isn't unusual and (so long as you document it to the lender's satisfaction) won't pose a problem.  Monthly payments are a different beast.  The full mortgage application is going to be based off the credit history, debts, assets, income, etc. of the people on the mortgage, and you will be approved only if the bean-counters decide your proposed monthly mortgage payments are reasonable in the context of your household budget.  Recurring gifts from your parents to pay some percentage of your mortgage can't figure into that, because your parents aren't obligated to you or the lender or anyone else to continue giving such gifts.    Can you afford the mortgage you want without your parents' assistance on the mortgage payments?  If so, pretend that assistance is not going to happen.  Don't tell the lender about it.  Don't use it in your household budget.  If your loan application with yourself and your SO isn't strong enough for the sales price you're considering, nothing is going to help that except having your parents put their financial futures on the line for you, and committing to your mortgage as cosigners or coborrowers.  This of course is going to have some very serious legal, financial, and relationship consequences for all four of you."

The only thing you need to disclose are issues that can result in loss of value (ie, a developer is building an apartment next door or is going to block your ocean view)... Or issues that could result in a Lien being filed against the property.  However, fence damage is a civil matter. They cannot place a lien on your property because you damaged a fence, or broke their window, etc. They would take the case to small claims and go that route.  Plumbers/carpenters are a classic case where your failure to pay for work rendered on your property can result in a lien being filed."

Once it appreciates enough to break even or make a bit of money, sell it then.   If your lender isn't excited about you having two mortgages at once and if you can stand to lose the money, I guess the standard stuff applies- write a contract on the next house that is contingent on the sale of your current house, negotiate a leaseback with the buyer of your house to give you time to move, have plans for a hotel/extended living thing in case things take a bit more time.

RealEstate,3cei16,ctrealestateatty,3,Tue Jul 7 17:42:46 2015 UTC,Can you expand on this?  What was the unlicensed person doing exactly?
RealEstate,3cei16,ctrealestateatty,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:03:18 2015 UTC,"The unlicensed person was ""renting"" the Realtor's listings, collecting security deposits, and of course never letting the tenant into the house since the houses were listed for sale, not for rent, and the unlicensed person had no authority to rent them anyway. The local Realtor hearing panel said there was no violation of ethics since I couldn't prove that the Realtor helped defraud the victims and there was nothing in writing with the unlicensed person to prove that agency with the unlicensed person existed.  How or why would anyone put an illegal agreement into writing anyway makes no sense to me. The only proof I have of the Realtor cooperating with the unlicensed person is the audio recording of the phone call with her I put online. But I'd think that's enough to prove a breach of Realtor ethics. Unless it's NOT against Realtor ethics to work with unlicensed, unauthorized people like that."

The question here is did the real estate agent know about and endorse the actions of the unlicensed person? Were they colluding? I'm not entirely convinced from the audio.

When you have a downpayment saved and stable income and you find a house that you like in a location you like. You don't have to love it, it doesn't have to be perfect, but I think it's important to at least like it.  What is a fair price is determined by the market at the present time. Not what it used to be worth, and not what you think it will be worth in the future. If you strongly disagree with prices, then you are always free to refrain from buying (indeed, I would strongly recommend it, if you really can't convince yourself that what you are buying is ""worth it"")."

RealEstate,3cautw,kmanna,2,Tue Jul 7 04:13:23 2015 UTC,"They do want to sell the house but they sell it for CONSIDERABLY more money. It's not uncommon for a flipper to buy a $200,000 house and sell it for $400,000 where I live.   The townhouse I bought was flipped. She bought the whole building (3 units) for ~$400,000ish, added a finished basement, completely new kitchen, walls, roof, furnace, bathrooms, refinished the floors, new windows, electrical, plumbing. It's basically a new house in an old frame. She then proceeded to sell them for about $400,000 a piece. I don't know how much it cost her to flip them, but assuming it cost her $200,000, she still made $600,000. It's frustrating what they can do with a ton of liquid cash and time. Someone like me - I can't buy a property in the state this was in beforehand because I don't have the cash to put into it immediately or the time to sit on a rent payment AND a mortgage. It was definitely not in a livable state when she got it."
RealEstate,3cautw,DiggingNoMore,4,Tue Jul 7 13:59:34 2015 UTC,Why would you want to buy a house that is not in a livable state?

You're complaining that a flipper bought a house (and improved and resold it), which prevented you from buying it.  Why did you want to buy a house in an unlivable state?  Not the generic you, but you personally.  I'm just not sure how the house flipper buying this house prevented you from buying it.  Why did you want to buy such a delapitated house?"
RealEstate,3cautw,DCCWA,2,Tue Jul 7 17:19:55 2015 UTC,"My experience (as a flipper) is that I can't compete with end user buyers in most scenarios where they play (house that is in decent condition, conventionally financeable). The end user buyer can pay A LOT more than me and still get good value. My offer price is predicated on spending 30k+ in rehab plus my profit margin too. That creates a wide gap. Cash offers are attractive, but not so much that a Seller is going to take tens of thousands of dollars less than a financed offer unless they are really desperate to sell."

I just don't get it.  The economy isn't doing that great - where are people getting all the excess money?  Are low interest rates propping up the market artificially?  I have a feeling that a hike in rates might tank the RE market HARD.
RealEstate,3cautw,cinepro,5,Mon Jul 6 17:27:40 2015 UTC,"By definition, artificially low interest rates would have to be ""propping up the market"" artificially.  And since the interest rates are set by a group of people and not the free market, they are all ""artificial.""  Obviously, when (if?) mortgage interest rates are ever able to rise to a more realistic level (seriously, it's a loan on a depreciating asset for 30 years!?), house prices will have to drop or people just won't be able to afford to buy a home.    Even a small uptick in mortgage rates seems to have an immediate effect.  Expect the NAR, MBA, home builders and other parties that depend on high home prices to fight any rate increases tooth and nail so the rest of us can subsidize the higher home prices:  https://www.mainstreet.com/article/the-housing-recovery-looks-ominous-with-mortgage-applications-plunging"

RealEstate,3cautw,BALONYPONY,15,Thu Jul 9 18:12:50 2015 UTC,I JUST bought in the Seattle area and I couldn't agree with you more. The market is crazy and the best competitive edge you can get is an agent that has the connections and experience to lock down something as it hits the market. Look for homes that do not have a review date and make sure to personalize your offer. It sounds cheesy to accompany your offer with a note but every little bit helps. Also make sure if you enter in an escalation clause you are going above the 2-3k minimum. Up here bidding wars are unavoidable and you have to come to terms that you are going to pay over asking. I hope you find your house and I can certainly empathize where you are right now. I was equally as frustrated.
RealEstate,3cautw,squired,3,Mon Jul 6 16:07:34 2015 UTC,"I've never bought into the personal letter deal. Has that worked for any of you? Maybe I'm just in too competitive of a market...

RealEstate,3cautw,Trapline,5,Tue Jul 7 06:06:04 2015 UTC,"I think it hugely depends on area and local customs. I am in Montana and I think personal notes would go a long ways more often than not.

You get 30 offers on a place and they all have notes... Ugh."
RealEstate,3cautw,scumble_bee,3,Tue Jul 7 12:37:15 2015 UTC,I have 2 friends that were each able to win with a lower bid because of a personal letter.  I think it depends on the person.  An old couple that has lived in the neighborhood forever would rather see the house sold to a young newlywed couple than a flipper or foreign investor.  In the grand scheme of things $5-10k is going to make a retiree run out of money.
RealEstate,3cautw,BALONYPONY,5,Tue Jul 7 13:30:28 2015 UTC,"It really goes back to ensuring you are doing EVERYTHING you can to have the most attractive offer. No letter is going to place you above a cash offer obviously, but if you are one of the 20 offers that are close to identical it may separate you from the pack."
RealEstate,3cautw,wamazing,43,Tue Jul 7 13:51:16 2015 UTC,"People get emotional about houses. Lots of societal pressure here too, if you're young and married you probably get as many nosy questions from relatives about when you will buy a house as you do about when you will have kids. And lots of people who have never owned houses are deluded about what it is actually like. It comes with a lot of work and expense that renters can dodge.   A frequent argument for buying a house is that renting is 'throwing money away.' But realistically, 95% of your house payments for the first 5 years is interest, so, to me that's just another form of throwing money away. Yes you get a slight tax break but when you figure in maintenance (shit a can of good paint is $40) I don't think the finances are a good reason to buy.   Good reasons to buy are, you are in control of your housing situation and not at the mercy of a lease or landlord. As long as you accept the responsibility, the up side is, it's your space you can do what the hell you want to it/in it and not worry about your next move. Buy when you feel like you want to stay in a particular area for many years, when you find a house you love and can afford without stretching financially. Buy when you have gotten a good handle on managing your finances and have a decent down payment and cash reserves built up.   I'm with you, I think many areas are having another ""bubble"" perhaps not quite as extreme as the last time. Bear in mind that the government is still artificially holding down interest rates, and they can't do that forever (will be interesting to see what the next election brings...) If/when interest rates rise, I am of the opinion that this will drive prices down. But you're better off buying when rates are high and principal prices are low, because if rates drop in a few years you can refi. Whereas you can never get away from a high principle amount short of foreclosing (which can be a financial disaster for many folks).   There was a Case-Shiller study published back in 2004 or 2005, I've since lost the PDF to a hard drive crash and it's not online any longer. But it said for every 1% rise in rates, you lose 10% of the potential buyers at any given price point, because more of the payment is now interest. That has big implications for most markets, real estate is just supply and demand. If you remove a good chunk of the demand, you now might see a shift to a buyers' market.   If you think the places there are overpriced, I don't think there is any downside to renting for a few more years. That said, if someone really wants to buy now and they don't care if they might be upside down in a few years, I wouldn't say you shouldn't buy now. You have to live somewhere, a house is more than an investment. My own house has swung up and down by a couple hundred thou over the last 10 years but it's mattered not at all to me because I'm settled there. But if you think it might matter to you, then take that sign seriously and make sure you understand the risks here. Good luck."
RealEstate,3cautw,Ilikedogs29,9,Mon Jul 6 14:02:14 2015 UTC,In my city the best deal is to buy. One bedrooms in decent neighborhoods go for $800-$900 a month not including an utilities and rental houses are about $1250-$1500. Even with repairs I saved a ton of money by buying and only paying $750 a month for a 4/2 and if we don't want to sell  when we move we can rent because the housing rental situation here is large.   Where my family is from though renting is better. my brother has a nice 2/1 apartment for $425 monthly with water included.

Renting is better than buying for someone who isn't really prepared for it, and you aren't throwing money away,  you are buying freedom from the comittment and responsibility that comes with home ownership (aside from lease terms). It's not a bad thing if someone isn't ready or stable enough for the commitment of a house, and in the short term renting can be a better financial bet."

It is harrowing to watch dilapidated 2 bedroom rowhomes in need of a total gut sell for over $300,000. I'm also starting to feel really discouraged.   We're in our local market's downswing (it will pick up again in August-Sept, and then dies down again until Spring), and my realtor is surprised that housing prices are still kind of insane.

RealEstate,3cautw,kmanna,7,Tue Jul 7 00:29:52 2015 UTC,"I think the markets, including whether it's a good time to buy for any home buyer, are very regional.  I live in Denver. Prices in the Denver market has been increasing at a rapid rate because tons of people are moving to Denver for jobs. The Denver/Boulder area is really becoming a mini-silicon valley with Google, Microsoft, and Amazon opening and expanding their offices here. Not to mention the hundreds of other tech companies that have decided to make Denver their home.  There are a lot of people who are referring to the Denver situation as a ""bubble that will burst"" and are saying ""who would be stupid enough to buy with these prices."" Anything is possible. The economy in Denver could tank, all of the tech startups and established companies could leave, and these things would force people to move away from Denver, leaving an excess of housing. But unless people LEAVE Denver or developers flood the market with homes, I don't see a massive price drop in the value of homes in the future. The fact of the matter is that there are currently way more people who need housing than housing available in my area.   I've been told winter is a good time to buy - we were able to time our search such that we closed around the holidays with the idea that not many people would want to be uprooting their lives between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but that surprisingly didn't help us. The market never cooled down this past winter for the Denver area. I definitely believe that at some point, the prices will level off and maybe even decrease a little as developers finally catch up with the need for housing in the area, but I don't think it's in their best interest to flood the market with housing such that it's a buyers market.  I don't know the situation where you live. I would say it depends on what's driving the market. How do you know that the house will average out around $150,000? What does your realtor think?"
RealEstate,3cautw,skimmer,2,Mon Jul 6 14:12:20 2015 UTC,"I can't say I have a glass ball to say what will happen with housing prices. I was looking at the price trends for a particular property I was looking at and put an offer in on. Over the past ten years I've seen it hover during the best times around $160,000 and the worst times $135,000. The house has been updated a bit, but not that much. The seller is saying that the house appraised for $209,000. They were asking$175,000 and the previous buyer offered them $169,900 and financing fell through for them. I'm not going to go all gung-ho so I'm offering them $169,900 and asking them to cover closing costs. However, apparently a few other people have made offers on the house. I'm guessing I'll lose the ""bid"", but I'm not going to get into a bidding war over a house that at its highest has been with $177,000"

If you're making a big salary and have a bright future in the area, then just be patient and keep saving and keep looking.    If you're making a more normal salary, then consider whether you really want to live your life in an overpriced area, or if you want to relocate before your career gets any further along."
RealEstate,3cautw,squired,7,Mon Jul 6 15:17:16 2015 UTC,It's horrible. Currently it is a sellers market as the home prices have rubberbanded past what they should be. On top of that it's summer. People are buying and moving.   I would wait at least a year and let the dust settle before I purchase.
RealEstate,3cautw,JimmyDuce,5,Mon Jul 6 15:26:58 2015 UTC,"Also, I'm shocked that people are willing to pay $180,000 - $200,000 for a house that is already at its peak price and will probably average out around $150,000 when all is said and done.    Are you planning on moving soon? If not, run the numbers.   There are a lot of factors to consider, but total loan cost is one to start with. If you buy the home for $180k @ 3.75, the loan will ultimately cost you $300k. If you wait and get really lucky, maybe you could buy it for $150k in a year or two at 5.25%, which will ultimately cost you $298k.   Is $2k worth waiting and hoping the market drops 17% in one year? We know the rates are going up next year, we don't know how the market will react. Use the best info you can gather and make the decision that is best for your situation.    Also, near term drops are not expected like others here are suggesting. Yes, increased rates historically lower prices but that is less likely to happen immediately as the Fed has stated that they will slow the rate increases if the economy does not keep pace. ""The key is understanding that the higher rates will be driven by stronger demand for credit, coming from a strengthening economy. In that environment, home sales can grow even though mortgage rates rise, at least for a year or two.""   note: Take all of this with a grain of salt, no one knows for certain what will happen over the next year or two and I am not a professional."

I was speaking more towards speculating on falling home prices vs increased loan rates because Op didn't sound like he'd considered that extremely pertinent variable.  I personally don't believe home prices in most markets will be drastically reduced within the next 18 months, but I'm almost certain rates will be significantly higher.    If he's looking at depressed or particularly rural markets of course, that may not be true,  but he didn't offer enough information for us to speculate with him on that bit."

I know its frustrating (we were looking daily for over 15 months) but something will turn up.  One strategy that we used was to find the houses that have been on the market for 3+ months and are overpriced and make them an offer that you think is fair.  We ended up getting a great house that was price $50,000 over what we thought was fair value and the sellers did not have any other offers after 3 months so they took our offer.   House ended up appraising above what we paid so it was a win for us.  Also, this is a slow time for new listings.  More will start up again in the Fall.   Keep your eye on interest rates too.  If they keep going up you may not be able to afford the house you could have a few months ago."

Since the financial crisis, it's like any increase in price is considered a bubble.   Op doesn't want to pay a few thousand over the highest selling price ever for the house when the in the long term (I'd say long term is 20+ years), homes appreciate in value if you keep up with repairs/fixtures and don't make a bunch of cosmetic choices totally unappealing to the masses.

The actual formula should be [(3 * income) + wealth].   Of my 30 something friends that have recently bought,  3/5 of them had some inheritance in play and/or the option of a family ""gift"" to nab the right house in case of a bidding war. The wealth gap is widening among all demographics and you'll see it most in hotbed cities.    There isn't any more supply in the most competitive markets and the increasing commuter traffic in all major cities is creating a feeding frenzy that I don't see abating anytime soon. Coupled with impending rate increases, it's a perfect little storm.   The economy isn't poor.  Profits and productivity are at an all time high and not all of that going to just a few people.  There is a lot more money in play than most people want to admit and it isn't going to disappear; at least not in the jumbo markets. Some are bound to go the way of London/Tokyo."

You also have to remember that the bust and recession were actually a boon for those with even a little wealth and real assets. It was bad for most,  but upper middle class and above were able to suck up some juicy sales while everything was cheap and rode the financial markets back up as they corrected themselves."

Congrats, honest, that you were wise enough to buy what you were comfortable with.  I don't know enough about the specifics of Denver.  But I can say San fran for example most houses are close to or over a million.  While many in San fran are paid well above the national average, house prices are still closer to 5X or greater most well paid salaries.

RealEstate,3cautw,someonessomebody,4,Mon Jul 6 18:17:31 2015 UTC,"There's a great quote I heard once, usually attributed to Keynes or Buffet, but I think both are incorrect. It goes:   ""Markets can remain irrational a lot longer than you and I can remain solvent.""   As a real-estate buyer I think that has to be in your head these days. Supply/Demand works over long terms, and the real-estate market has always had peaks and valleys.   If you looked at it in 2006/2007, a lot of people were concerned we were overvalued, but even more people were arguing that it was impossible, that there would be no crash, etc. People were buying WAY more than they could afford with zero down because they figured they'd just refinance in two years when their value went up 20-30% or whatever. After all, it'd happened over the past 5-7 years, why wouldn't it continue?  So when the real estate market crashed due to the sub-prime crisis, a lot of people lost their asses and it took 5-6 years for most places to recover. Many places have, now, recovered, and some are way past that.  For example, in great job markets (like the Bay Area, CA) you might as well forget about buying a SFH as a first-time buyer in a good neighborhood unless you have $150k-$200k to put DOWN on a house. These homes will list for $700-$800k and go for 20% more.   A friend just bought a 2bd/2ba townhouse, 1100 sq feet, $350/mo HOA with a pool/gym. Nice neighborhood. Quiet. Listing price was $525k, bidding war brought him to $625k and he won it. Townhouse built in 1959, never been renovated, and he now has to pay to replace the carpets, asbestos popcorn ceiling, kitchen cabinets, floors, etc.  He's going to put about $50k into it now. Is $675k worth it for a 2bd/2ba townhouse in a nice neighborhood? To him, I guess so.  To me, I'm just waiting for the market to drop again someday. It'll happen sooner or later. But I literally can't afford to buy the house I'm renting, and renting, despite the massive rent increase, is still a LOT cheaper than buying.   I can rent a 3bd/2ba house in a great school district (but in a surrounding suburb, 1 hour from work) for $2800/month. Buying this house would cost me $675k (closer to work it'd be $850k), which means I'd need ~$140k downpayment (which I don't have) and then finance $535k, which would be somewhere in the neighborhood of a $3500/month payment after property taxes and insurance and whatever.   So yeah, even if I had the $140k downpayment, I don't think I'd buy right now.  TL;DR - I think it's a shitty time for first time buyers in some hot markets. However, the question of whether the next real-estate dip is in 20 years or 20 days is unknowable."

If you want to buy a newer house on more than a teeny tiny plot of land an hour's drive away from downtown, you are looking at 750-800k easy.  A knock down might be a bit cheaper at 500-600K.

RealEstate,3cautw,spinlock,3,Tue Jul 7 04:35:23 2015 UTC,"There is rarely that much ""wiggle room"" for price, but yes, the price seems high now for Seattle. (not sure which part of Washington you're in) Is it unreasonably high? I don't think anyone knows for sure.  When I bought in 2011, I made offers on 3 different houses before I got one. There were multiple offer and all cash offers outcompeting mine. Keep in mind, this was basically still at the bottom of the bubble (after the federal tax credit expired). But it was a good price.  When I bought in 2013, I only made one offer one one house and I got it. I don't think it's as good a price, but it's definitely better than the crazy prices today.  But when you're ready. Plan to stay there for a while. Make sure you're comfortable paying the mortgage, and don't think of it as an investment. Think of it as locking in how much you pay for housing by putting down a large deposit.  How do you know that it's reached its peak price? And if you're so confident of it, wait. But if California really turns into a dust bowl (an extreme example, but not impossible), Seattle prices will only climb higher, as people exit out of California."
RealEstate,3cautw,Plum12345,2,Tue Jul 7 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"That's the thing here in Portland. Housing prices seem ridiculous, but with the projected growth in the area, I don't see how there's any way for prices to go down in the long term. It's a risk either way. It could be a minor bubble, and interest rates could increase further depressing prices, and suddenly all the people buying houses for 50k over asking could be under water. Or, we could wait another couple years, have our rent skyrocket and end up being priced out of any decent locations all together. There's no way to know. I think the fact that the city is changing at such a rapid pace makes it feel like the stakes are incredibly high to choose right or face terrible consequences."

RealEstate,3cautw,akharon,2,Mon Jul 6 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"One metric that I do think is important is affordability of those homes. Interest rates are really low for 30 year fixed homes so when you buy a house for $200k you are basically locking in your monthly housing cost. If you're planning to stay for a long time, the numbers really start to look good.  But, I totally agree that the market is crazy right now. I think you are doing the right thing by looking though. You need to practice walking away from deals that aren't right. That is the most important skill in real estate (and maybe life in general).  If you do want to get into the market, you might look at buying a rental. I'm looking in neighborhoods that aren't great (i.e. you wouldn't buy yourself a house there) but have good access to public transit to get into San Francisco. My thought is that people will rent in these places because housing is out of control in SF and it's temporary for them so there isn't the same aversion to the neighborhood that a buyer would have."

The house my family bought in the late 70s for 42,000 is worth $500-600k now in not hot market. It's so local you can't make generalizations. Interest rates have been at the lowest rates in 50 years. The only real way to value the homes are to go back as far as possible in the sales records for the neighborhood and figure 3% CAGR and determine if the current price is above or below that.  That has been about the national increase in real estate prices since WW2.  Also tax beaks and not having to move are other reasons to own homes."
RealEstate,3cautw,IQuestionEveryOne,5,Mon Jul 6 20:59:10 2015 UTC,"With interest rates below 5%, there couldn't really be a better time to buy a home.  While yes, some markets are hotter than others, and inventory might be low in your area driving up home prices, its a darn sight better than the 19% interest my parents paid on their first home.  Low interest rates mean higher price affordability.  I'm in Pittsburgh, PA-- and looked for 11 months before I found the right home for the right price.  Do NOT be afraid to ""insult"" someone on with an offer you feel is the correct price for the home.  At the end of the day, the worst that happens is that they say no.  Best case you get the deal you want, or at least open negotiations.  There's a house we looked at priced at $450,000. After a bit of market research, I made an offer at $350,000.  They said no, big deal... and their house is still on the market, with no other offers, even after lowering their price to $410,000.  We lucked out a bought a better, larger home-- in a much more sought after neighborhood for the same money.   At the end of the day, a property is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.  So TL:DR -- Low ball is better than no ball. Patience is virtue."
RealEstate,3cautw,ticklefists,9,Mon Jul 6 21:06:45 2015 UTC,"Interest prices work both ways. While it isn't dollar for dollar, the higher the interest rates, the lower the house price should be, to a certain extent. I don't know what that amount is myself, but I would imagine it makes a big difference in what a house can sell for when there aren't as many buyers capable of affording it due to higher rates. So if you can save up more of a downpayment, you can get more of a house when rates are higher because the house value will have gone down. Whereas buying a house priced higher due to low rates, will make selling it at the same amount harder when rates go back up. So it could be a very dangerous time to buy a house with all that in mind."
RealEstate,3cautw,cinepro,6,Mon Jul 6 21:52:56 2015 UTC,"I still find it hard to believe a house that sold for 300k at a 3% rate would be 270k at 4%, because sellers aren't always rational, and might hold onto their house unless it sells for at least what they paid. I would imagine the impact would be greater on entry level homes than more expensive homes, because although interest may be a bigger deal on $500k than 200k, the person buying a fancier home likely already has equity in a house, so they have more cash for a downpayment."
RealEstate,3cautw,romerom,3,Mon Jul 6 14:26:35 2015 UTC,"YOU ARE THINKING EXACTLY WHAT I AM! People are excited because of the low interest rates. They think ""I can pay more because the interest rate is low"" then sellers know this so they just mark up the price as much as possible. Then, when you own the house and interest rates normalize suddenly when you want to try to sell it in the future no one will buy it because you want what you paid for it(at least) and a little more. Now, interest rates are higher again, and no one wants to pay that amount with the higher interest rate. So, you are forced to lower your price to below what you bought the house for, and you've just lost thousands of dollars.   Almost makes sense to buy a house when interest rates are higher and home prices are lower then refinance when interest rates go back down."
RealEstate,3cautw,catjuggler,5,Mon Jul 6 15:39:37 2015 UTC,"Still, you can't really time the market. First off, it could be another 5 years before home prices come down, if they do, as a result of higher interest rates. People won't just lower home prices when selling overnight. People have already held onto houses that were technically worth less than they paid for them for 7-8 years after the crash in 08. People would likewise hold onto houses that went down due to higher interest rates for years. And if people aren't selling for less, then the market will still be inflated, even if somewhat artificially. So that would hold it up a bit.  So would you be willing to wait a whole nother half a decade or more before buying a house?  And there is no guarantee that would happen.  And the interest rates might not go back down in the future like now ever, or in the next 20-30 years anyhow. So having a higher downpayment would make that irrelevant a bit, but still something to consider.  There are so many different factors that go into housing, no one can truly predict things that well. I have myself been wondering what will happen when all the baby boomers start retiring and selling their houses, there will be a huge influx of inventory, and no one that can afford to take their places at the huge salaries they were getting. I think that is the biggest long term housing crisis over the next 10-20 years. That is the one thing that could have a permanent impact on the price of houses. But again, who knows.  At the end of the day, you just have to buy whenever you feel ready, and ignore the market, unless it feels really inflated artificially."

Rates are low, and inventory is good.  They also assure me that as a homeowner, there has never been a better time to sell than now.  There are a lot of interested buyers, so I can get top dollar.    So things are really good all around."
RealEstate,3cautw,calmloki,9,Tue Jul 7 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"But, I totally agree that the market is crazy right now. I think you are doing the right thing by looking though. You need to practice walking away from deals that aren't right. That is the most important skill in real estate (and maybe life in general).   It is in the best interest of an agent to tell people that.  No agent who gets paid off of a commission of a sale is going to say that it is not a good time to buy."
RealEstate,3cautw,1wf,3,Tue Jul 7 04:22:26 2015 UTC,"Oddly, I was considering selling two of my properties last summer (in a partially gentrified area) and my agent said to wait."
RealEstate,3cautw,merkk,2,Mon Jul 6 17:29:13 2015 UTC,"Inventory sucks prices are high but rates are still low so you can afford more. Look at what a payment on 200,000 is at 7.5 and then at 3.5 which I got a few months ago. up to about 4.5 or so now.  If you can accept a not exactly what you want house you can probably get an excellent payment."

Bought again in 2010 and am about to bid on a place tomorrow.  We've been jacking up our rental rates and keep hearing that applicants can't find anything better and cheaper than we offer. I like the idea of buying when places show at their worst, but don't know that there will be any better time to buy than now."
RealEstate,3cautw,cbarrister,2,Mon Jul 6 20:10:28 2015 UTC,"Again, your situation is completely different than me, a first time home buyer. I'm not trying to buy up property and rent it out, and turn into a slum lord. For you it absolutely makes sense to buy up property at a low rate. You can get your money back and more and basically have someone else paying the mortgage on your property. The one thing I could do is buy a property and rent out a room, or a split level. I have to ask myself if it would be decent of me to finally get my wife some privacy only to invite a stranger into my home so I can get some rent. I think I should wait at least a year and enjoy the new property before taking that leap. People are forgetting that there's a human element to this too. It's not 100% business for everyone. We've spent a lot of years with no privacy together whether it's room mates or squished between apartments with paper walls."
RealEstate,3cautw,JimmyDuce,3,Mon Jul 6 21:57:33 2015 UTC,You are upset.  The place we bought in 2010 was a home for us.  I get that you're looking for a home and aren't looking to become a slumlord - if being a slumlord is your idea of operating rental property you really really should avoid it. The links I attached were so you could look at historic interest rates and property value over the last hundred years.  This so you could make up your own mind whether you should buy now or wait.  Best of luck.

RealEstate,3cc00m,Tyrynn,7,Mon Jul 6 18:59:58 2015 UTC,"Most states have basically two kinds of disclosures for this stuff.    A mandatory one where you basically answer questions.  So if any of those questions were untruthfully answered, they could owe damages.  (more on this later).    The second kind is a bit dicier.  Most states also require you disclose latent defects, that you are aware of.  What this basically means, is you most disclose things you know about (you do not have any obligation typically to investigate issues) and are NOT observable to a reasonable person doing a reasonable inspection.    So in your brother's example, was this observable or is there any question on WI's disclosure form that dealt with this that they answered untruthfully?  If someone could see they were buckling, then they may not have to have said anything.  Every house has tons of defects.  Disclosure laws try to address the stuff that someone may know about, that can't be seen.  Assuming they did some minor repairs that they reasonably knew would fail to conceal the issue or something like that, well now how do you get paid?  You can hire a lawyer and sue them.  You will have to show that they knew about them, you couldn't detect them etc.  Then you will have to show you suffered damages from the non disclosure.  After this, (and attorney fees/court costs etc where applicable) you will get a judgement.  You will now have to figure out how to compel them to pay you, either through them just doing this, or a garnishment of wages and/or assets.    In many many cases, this isn't worth doing.  In some it is.    Unless they did something to conceal the floor issue though so your brother couldn't see it, I'm not really sure you have much of a case.  Them talking to a floor company and determining their humidifiers damaged it doesn't particularly matter if you should have been able to see it was damaged."
RealEstate,3cc00m,NumNumLobster,2,Mon Jul 6 20:11:22 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your response.  The company that came out to check it out for the original owners were the actual builders, which is why I thought it might be more effective as ""proof.""  I'll be sure to show them this.  Thanks again."
RealEstate,3cc00m,NumNumLobster,2,Mon Jul 6 20:16:03 2015 UTC,np.  keep in mind I'm talking generally.  I do not practice in WI nor know the specific laws there.  These are fairly universal concepts though.  If repairing the floor is an expensive enough issue they'd be wise to bounce it off an attorney.
RealEstate,3cc00m,nofishies,3,Mon Jul 6 20:20:44 2015 UTC,The problem is proving they knew.  If you can it is pretty slam dunk. But unless you find the person who diagnosed it for them it is very hard to prove.  So if the floor is worth enough to talk to a lawyer about do that.
RealEstate,3cc00m,nofishies,2,Mon Jul 6 19:56:50 2015 UTC,"well assuming the builder has documentation that the previous owners contacted him about this issue, and that he told them that they had damaged it, would that suffice?  If so, what would their next step be?  Do they need a lawyer?"

RealEstate,3cc00m,Cold417,3,Mon Jul 6 21:17:21 2015 UTC,So it flattens out during the winter but buckles bad enough to notice in the spring/summer?  Weird - to bad the inspector didn't catch it.  I imagine it would sound pretty bad walking on it.

There was a bar where part of the middle of the floor was buckling from a sub floor problem that was directing basement moisture to one area (and lord knows how many beers were spilled on the damn thing).  It was probably a 100 year old floor.  I had 3 flooring guys look at it, and they all refused to touch it without doing a replacement, then 2/3 told me really the way to fix it is to take a thin saw blade and cut down a few joints so there is a bit of space for it to expand to, then push it down and secure it, but thats like a $100 job and they wouldn't want to guarantee something like that with 15k in flooring to replace if they fuck it up.  If they decide they are actually going to replace it, or your brother is a diy'er you may try something like that."

You're not developing land,call the city planner and talk to them (its their job to handle these things), they may have a simpler process. What is shown are fees for making a whole subdivision, it could be applied to a lot split,but they will probably help you out to make it simpler.  You don't need a real estate agent to do this, they are the wrong folks to talk to (no offense to agents, but this is usually outside your scope).  A local surveyor would also have some knowledge of the process, you'll have to hire one anyway so they will likely give you some free advice also...  Good luck."
RealEstate,3ccnjf,NumNumLobster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:55:39 2015 UTC,I would agree.  It seems like they think OP wants to subdivide and make a neighbourhood.

If the seller thought the leak came from the hair line crack and fixed it, then they did their part. It's hard to fix a leak they didn't know about. You didn't request they actually do a full service or even check anything else on the tub, so you can't blame them for not finding a different leak.  As far as the jets not working, how do you know they knew? I can't recall the last time I put the jets on in my tub. Maybe they assumed they worked.

RealEstate,3cc2vz,bluelion24,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:35:21 2015 UTC,You can't estimate a market value without comps. You might have to search back in time or go to a nearby area.  Are these deeded? Try to find the deeds and then search public records for sales.
RealEstate,3cc2vz,wamazing,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:38:00 2015 UTC,Yes they are deeded. I am surprised to hear the association can't provide these for me. You would think they would all be logged in the system or they would at least have the prior records stored somewhere.

RealEstate,3caxdv,ShortWoman,5,Mon Jul 6 14:52:27 2015 UTC,"This is the way I see it, it sounds like a steal, and she just wants to unload it and move back to Tennessee, that's great!  It does raise some concern that she would be selling so cheap, there are some savings by not using an agent, but at this price point not nearly as significant as the hit she is taking.  It may just be that she s anxious to get back home, but I would definitely have the house checked out by a home inspector to ensure that there is nothing of concern.  Secondly, a home is typically the largest purchase most people ever make, this isn't something you want to do without professional assistance.  There are all kinds of buyer and seller protections in a real estate contract, and missing something could open up a whole can of worms that you don't want to have to deal with, there are so many scenarios that could happen I could never begin to illustrate them all, but what happens if the seller is hit by a bus?  If she dies, are her heirs obligated to sell to you still under the contract?  What if she is in the hospital for months on end, what happens?  So many things that really have nothing to do with buying the house-until it happens.  I am a Realtor and I would never attempt to draft my own purchase contract.  You can likely hire an agent for a flat fee to draft the paperwork using the contracts that have been professionally written by attorneys, and as a bonus they will walk you through the entire process of setting up closing, dealing with any issues and so forth.  Or you can hire a real estate attorney to draft an individual purchase contract, and they will likely walk you through the rest of the process as far as setting things up, but likely not deal with any potential issues between buyer and seller (like inspection negotiations of financing).  I would make some phone calls to attorneys and Realtors and find out what you can get this done for.  Even at an expectation of 3% for a buyer's agent that is only $1950 for protecting the largest purchase you have likely made at this point in your life.  I would bet you can negotiate that downward quite a bit as the agent isn't investing time showing you houses and so forth.    Don't walk past potential dollars to save potential pennies, good luck!"

You need someone experienced to do a title search, draft your deed, and make sure it is recorded appropriately. My company pays the closing attorney about $450 if that helps give you some perspective.  It looks like you are financing the home -- I very much doubt your lender will allow some kind of DIY closing anyway.

RealEstate,3cd9g3,toolrules,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:33:20 2015 UTC,"I think you might be confusing two things.     lets talk about the legal description/surveys.  Why is the legal changing? are you combining them?  are the old ones negative and you are simplifying them?  Do you need to submit them to the county engineer for approvals?  Lawyers do that part.  If you are changing the legal description for whatever reasons, a lawyer should see it as they need to draft new deeds, submit for approvals etc.   Title abstracts take like a couple days to do (or less).  A lawyer should be able to review them in about 15 minutes.  Are you getting title insurance?  Is there a known title issue that needs resolved that is causing a problem?   agents tell you to have an attorney review a lot of times.  It makes it so when something does get fucked up we can say ""oh damn, you should have had your attorney look at it like I told you"".     I'm not really clear where the delay is here though.  Is it just getting the survey done?  Can you elaborate more on this?"
RealEstate,3cd9g3,NumNumLobster,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:39:46 2015 UTC,"I am probably confusing terms. I will try to explain better.    The legal description was written almost entirely in abbreviations/short hand. My understanding was the survey would change the land descriptions into something more readable?  We are not combining properties or submitting anything.  Not getting title insurance and there aren't any known title issues at this time.  I'm for covering my own butt. I hadn't thought of needing an attorney to review until it was suggested by the real estate agent (dual role, agent for seller/buyer)   The survey of the lands are completed and staked. We were told the abstracts would not be finished in time or, and I'm guessing here, they might get finished for closing but that would leave no time for attorney to review.  I live in rural town of 8k people and things do take a little more time which is what I'm guessing the delay is."
RealEstate,3cd9g3,Pollonius,2,Tue Jul 7 03:55:54 2015 UTC,You should get title insurance.  Large parcels of land can have some unknown title issues that really make title insurance worthwhile.

RealEstate,3cec5o,PutaGatito,3,Tue Jul 7 06:30:54 2015 UTC,"So you are making 16.50/hr, thats about $33k/year.  The rule of thumb is not to spend more than 3x your gross salary on a home, so you are right at about 100k, which after property taxes, insurance, etc will have the mortgage payment around $800/month.  I think you should create a budget to determine how much house you can afford.  You are bringing home around $2200/month after taxes, right?  So then figure in:  $500 month in groceries  $200/month baby supplies  $80 2 cell phones  $100 electricity  $25 water  $25 sewer  $40 natural gas  $120 month for gasoline  Car insurance?  do you want cable tv/internet?  car payment?  savings/home repairs/emergencies/car repairs?  health insurance premiums?  entertainment?  ""How does paying for a house even work? ""  Its like any other bill.  The bank mails you a statement or payment book.  You mail them a check monthly.  ""How many years is that $200,000 split over?""  Most home loans are for 15 or 30 years.  15 years = higher payment, but pay off the house more quickly  ""What price range should I be looking for?""  On your income, without the dad working, $100k max.  If you want some personal finance opinion, see if you can get the dad to work in the evenings when you are home with the baby, maybe he can deliver pizza or something.  Or if he can use a computer make a few hundred a month with working online through mturk/clickworker/uhrs/leapforce/lionbridge or some other work at home job (uhaul/apple/american express phone rep)."
RealEstate,3cec5o,Squeezer999,2,Tue Jul 7 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"The first step is going to be to talk to a lender and get pre-approved for a loan. They'll let you know what you can afford and what payments you can expect. Central Texas is a mostly hot area right now and almost every seller will require a pre approval letter with your offer anyway.   I work in the Austin area and you can find houses under 200,000 (the cheapest new construction I know of starts in the 140s), but you have to be a bit open in terms of where you want to move.   Another thing that will help is being a bit more flexible in what you are looking for. Due to high prices, detatched condos in central Texas are getting more popular. These are houses by design, but they are called condos due to how closely together they are built.   Find a lender, find an agent and get looking! Good luck!"

RealEstate,3cd5bw,justtoseeyousmile,3,Tue Jul 7 00:00:16 2015 UTC,"§ 55-248.18. Access; consent; correction of nonemergency conditions; relocation of tenant. A. The tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord to enter into the dwelling unit in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workmen or contractors. The landlord may enter the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant in case of emergency. The landlord shall not abuse the right of access or use it to harass the tenant. Except in case of emergency or if it is impractical to do so, the landlord shall give the tenant notice of his intent to enter and may enter only at reasonable times. Unless impractical to do so, the landlord shall give the tenant at least 24-hours' notice of routine maintenance to be performed that has not been requested by the tenant. If the tenant makes a request for maintenance, the landlord is not required to provide notice to the tenant.   Technically the owner/landlord can access your unit with less than 24 hours notice unless it is impractical to do so as long as it is not maintenance that any one of you have requested. Also, if your lease is written with the standard Virginia lease forms (which I imagine is the case if this guys is an agent), all of your names would have been listed at the top of the lease and labeled (""Tenant""). It's reasonable for him to ask for there to be one spokesperson for a group of tenants, but he shouldn't be claiming that this is because ""tenant"" is singular on the lease unless only one person's name is actually on it. He has no legal ground for this, it's just a matter of convenience and clarity.  As far as the mailing of the rent check goes, ask him to draft an addendum that you all have to agree to and sign with this new rent delivery destination. You would be well within your legal rights to still send it to the office as long as it was there by your due date, but that would really cause more headache than it's worth.

Unless there is some weird shit in your lease you can tell him to pound sand on pretty much everything you said.    You need to move out of that place, he sounds unstable, nearly bankrupt, or both.  I'd be worried he is trying to get in to steal stuff and making up excuses when you see him there.

Also, I edited my original post with a pic of the lawn as of this morning (it was dark when I got home last night).

RealEstate,3c9e07,woodentulips,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:51:34 2015 UTC,"Ask if there are signs of repairs or major updating. Check to see if they were done legally, if required to be permitted. I'm talking about major things like redoing electrical, pluming, or structural elements. You may have to check this later with your local zoning office, but at least you know what to look for with this info.   Ask if any parts of the home appear to be a conversion or addition. Follow up with the homeowner or municipality to make sure these areas were also permitted.   Find out if your inspector is checking a sample of things, or checking everything. For example mine checked a sample of the windows. Well he got the two good ones because all the rest of them suck and won't stay up unless I prop a stick under them. Also check (whether you do it or the inspector) ALL electrical switches and light fixtures. Note any that don't work, or that work oddly and might tip you off to a questionable DIY job.   And definitely let them know you want to know about anything not up to code.   Ask them how many houses in this area or from this builder or of this age they have inspected, and what are common issues in that type of house. Then see how yours compares. Around here I can tell you what year a house was built by how well the patio was done, this was a favorite place to cut corners during the boom years.   While you're in the house look at details. Do walls come together uniformly? Is everything level? Are there lots of cracks? Look at baseboards and trim, are they nicely cut and fitted or was it a rush job that lacked attention to detail. Look closely at the ceilings. Are there any signs of staining, or patching, or recent painting that might indicate issues with the roof?   No house is going to be perfect. You just want to head off any big surprises after you move in. Good luck."

Never heard of it (like i said, very new homeowner here)."
RealEstate,3c9nxh,SuperDuperPatel,6,Mon Jul 6 12:12:30 2015 UTC,"Capital gains tax is a taxation.  Typically, your real estate investors will purchase the house with the primary purpose to see an increase in the property's valuation after time. If you sell your house higher than what you bought it for, than that profitable amount will be subject to a capital gain tax. There is a nice real estate law (varies by state)  that says that if you lived in that as a primary residence for 2 years within the last 5 years, you can get a tax deduction of up to 250k if you are single and 500k if you are married on your capital gains taxation.  Example -- (this is a really basic example) a real estate investor will purchase a property at $70,000 with appropriate financing, knowing that with some time and home care, the property will increase.  Well 2 years later, the market is prospering, the real estate investor has fixed several parts of the property that looked terrible, etc. He has the property appraised and its now worth $105,000.   Well in ordinary situation, that real estate investor made a $35,000 profit.  Normally, that $35,000 would be subject to the capital gains tax.  But given that you have lived there for 2 years within the last 5 years, that $35,000 profit will go to you tax-free.  Edit: That's the very very general gist of it. Its a little more complex than that, but hopefully you get the basic concept"

RealEstate,3c9nxh,renegadecause,7,Mon Jul 6 14:41:50 2015 UTC,The fact pattern is as follows: you leapt to purchase a home at the age of 20.

Your claim that you leap for opportunities as they come seems disingenuous as you leapt to purchase this $45k property only to find that you're unhappy with it.

Now after living a full year of life (and gaining raises and hour increases) I see how affordable it is. I've always wanted to live rural, my fiance is just now agreeing with me. I'm actually concerned of how big a loss we would face.. I don't know squat about selling a house... especially with so little time of ownership.  Regardless..

We should've taken more time to decide where we wanted to be.. but at the time $80K for a home sounded way to expensive.   What makes it suddenly more affordable?  How large an increase in your income did you really get?  I'm sorry to be seemingly trying to rain on your parade, but...$80k isn't a lot of money, which is why a majority of people here are kind of stunned that you're finding places like that in livable parts of the country.   I wanted to become independent immediately after high-school, have a fiance, and now a baby   What makes you think you can afford the house (even if you do sell your current house)?  Babies are expensive.  As are weddings (even cheap ones, unless you're just planning to go to the courthouse)."

I hate the idea of dumping loads and loads of cash into something, that I will never own. With purchasing a house, I view as more of a ""savings account"" ... every mortgage I pay is being built into equity, instead of mindlessly throwing money at a guy to borrow a home (money that you'll never get back).  If you are talking about renting my current house out for a profit; (though I'd like to) I cannot do that. Whatever money I receive from selling my current house would go straight towards the down payment on the new house.  I do know that my house is worth more than when I bought it, not sure by how much yet though. Haven't done an appraisal yet, so no up-to-date figures.   Was hoping to see if moving within a year of a different purchase was even a plausible idea."

RealEstate,3c9nxh,favouritoburrito,2,Mon Jul 6 15:07:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not a professional. I don't know how much you've paid into the home, or what it MIGHT appraise for. I want to stress might because according the previous posts, you've put in $6k.  Have these repairs been on cosmetic repairs? I say that because just as other posters have mentioned, just because you fixed it up cosmetically, that doesn't  necessarily mean the value will improve.  For example, let's say you buy used car.  It isn't a beauty, but it runs just fine and you like it.  So you put some new rims on it, a new sound system, etc. Those are cool features, but if no one is interested in buying that model of car, the new features don't really make it more valuable.  Obviously, you've got to make the right decisions for you and your new family (congratulations, by the way!!!) but from one young person to another, I would try to make the house work a little longer. To revisit my car analogy, it's like you bought the used car in order for it to be a sound financial investment, to avoid taking a loss for depreciation, but you financed it and are paying mostly interest on it atm.  You've got to stick with the house a bit longer if you want your investment in the home to be effective in any way. If it doesn't work for you size wise... Or if it is a place that you don't feel safe... Okay, I get it, it won't work for your family. But if it's simply because you're looking for a change, you'll be better off trying to stick it out for a few more years. The smaller your mortgage (I mean, it's gotta be significantly smaller in your current home than it would be on the rural house) will allow you more financial freedom to save up for the house you'd like later.  When we bought our first home last month, we financially qualified for a much bigger loan. We could have bought a modest but much nicer home on an acre or two. But we wouldn't have had the funds to put any extra work into it to make it our own. For us, we didn't see the point of purchasing a home that we literally couldn't afford to leave in order to see a movie or vacation. So a modest home with breathing room was the right choice for us."

You should be able to get financing for an ADU separate from your mortgage.

My advice is to do your research on the company.  Ask for references, look them up on the Secretary of State website, google, etc.  Research the properties thoroughly, and go and look at them and the neighborhood they are in.  Never buy sight unseen.  I would stay away from quitclaims unless you have existing relationships with the company or you can do the title work yourself (buying a tax sale through quitclaim is fine, but not others).  Know the tax laws and implications of the state you buy in, how much and what kind of insurance you need and when its paid.  What rents are, what the cap rate is and could be in 5 years and so forth.  Every unit I own is a few hours of research, and that is even with an established PM and buyer's agent."

Also, you may want to read reviews on the web from people who have dealt with claims on rental properties.   I just had a claim be denied for a new roof from one of my property owners in GA. My contractor said that it he has seen problems with insurance companies that outsource the high-ladder inspections on denying claims which was the case with this company.   Since you are an investor I would recommend investing highly in some dependable and qualified contractors that can work on your properties.

When I talk to clients at the buyer consultation I mention I am their chief negotiator even with new construction. Try to sell your clients on your role even in this situation, how you can help negotiate price/options/closing costs/etc. If they wont budge, I wouldn't pursue it further, let it go, take the learning, beef up your script for buyer consultations and move on.

It isn't worth them getting a negative taste in their mouth and not referring their friends, or getting the builder thinking you're a problem agent."

Um, yes, you are according to the buyers agreement we have).    I told her I was really happy they found the right place since I was so attached to them and have been working so hard to get them out of the hotel. OF COURSE I'm upset that you no longer want my services and I won't be there to the end, but I wish you all the luck in your new home and I'll forward the buyers agreement like you asked.    I forwarded it and she just texted that she'll tell the builder I'm her agent.

RealEstate,3c8z8r,iRubicon,3,Mon Jul 6 00:41:13 2015 UTC,"So I want to make sure I understand you correctly. You want to buy a short sale that is going to the foreclosure auction in 2 weeks? And your agent hasn't vigorously discouraged you from doing this? I think it's ambitious to get a short approved in 2 months, and you've only got 2 weeks. I would have advised you to wait until this property returns to the market as a foreclosure.  Normally I would say that your agent knows your local market better than a bunch of randoms on the internet. However, there are several red flags that suggest this isn't so. Number 1, see the above. Number 2, if comps are really going for $280-300k, the bank isn't going to take $50-80k less. Finally, your statement about having your agent submit and offer to the bank is in error. The bank can't accept your offer because they don't own it. What the bank does is accept, reject, or demand new terms on the contract between you and the seller.   TLDR: Don't waste time and paper on this one. Keep looking.  Good luck!"
RealEstate,3c8z8r,ShortWoman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:38:56 2015 UTC,"Couple things you need to find out!   Is the Short sale already approved?   Are you willing to wait months and months to close if ever?   Does your agent know anything about short sales and the process and have they explained it to you?   Just because they owe 248k doesn't mean thats what the bank will take.  There going to do a BPO and possibly an apprasial to see what the market value is, and at the end of the day they have a certain amount that they want to net after closing costs commission ect and they won't take a penny less!"
RealEstate,3c8z8r,ashl10,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:55:59 2015 UTC,The home is currently listed as a pre-foreclosure.  The short sale has not been approved.  Our agent is planning on approaching the bank with the offer before the home goes up for auction on July 20th.    They have explained the short sale process and how painful and long it can be.  We are just trying to get into a home by the end of October so we are fine waiting a few months.
RealEstate,3c8z8r,landofmisfits,2,Mon Jul 6 01:04:00 2015 UTC,"The quickest short sale I sold took 3 months from offer to closing, and the longest 9 months, and tons in between.  If you really need  place to be by the end of October, a short sale may or may not work out."
RealEstate,3c8z8r,goosetavo2013,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:32:32 2015 UTC,"The math doesn't add up. If they owe $248K and the current market value is at least $280K why is it a short sale? I'm assuming the home doesnt look great or has some other issues keeping it below $280K. If you're the very first offer, it doesn't really matter how much your offer is, the bank (if it decides to stop the foreclosure process) will order an appraisal or BPO and get an independent idea of market value and counter you at that (they always counter). What bank is this with? Are they the only lien holder? What reputation do they have? Are the current owners getting divorced or declaring bankruptcy? All this will help you determine whether the short sale will take  few months or a year or more. Fastest I've seen is 60-days and the slowest is still ongoing after 1 year, prolly will be all done at 18 months we estimate. Best of luck."
RealEstate,3c8z8r,goosetavo2013,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:57:52 2015 UTC,"I was a little confused at the situation we were looking at when we first viewed the home.  The home goes up for auction on July 20th.  I am having a title search done by myself and having a family member do a walkthrough of the home.  I already spoke to the bank about financing for the home and they pretty much laughed at me.  The same family member that is doing the walk through is going to bring a cashiers check if everything goes well during the title search/walkthrough and bid on the home for me and my wife.  After he has the home our plan is to just mortgage it and purchase the home from him for the price he pays, plus any taxes and/or fees.  Am I missing anything major here?"
RealEstate,3c8z8r,lazinase,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:10:52 2015 UTC,"You're doing the right things, the biggest issues with foreclosures are title issues and condition of the home. If your family member knows what they're doing (can spot mold, water damage, electrical issues, etc), then you may avoid the worst. I personally wouldn't buy a property without my inspector taking a look, I'm not a contractor or DIY guy. Once your family member buys it cash, he can sell it to you and you can take out a mortgage on it. Find an attorney/escrow person and you likely don even need an agent. Cheers!"
RealEstate,3c81kg,MissPredicament,10,Sun Jul 5 19:42:07 2015 UTC,"I am in escrow for a flipped house that was purchased for $350K, flipped and listed for $480K.  Inspect the shit out of it. You can get it tested for meth, have an electrician inspect the electrical, have a contractor inspect the work, etc…  Our inspectors turned up multiple problems. HVAC the flippers installed was not to code. The electrical main was not run to code. The pool has cracks/leaks, the pump was not grounded, the pool light electrical is not to code. We are currently negotiating and may walk away if they can't come down enough.  But the $1300 we spent on inspections is better than paying top dollar for a house that needs $12,000 worth of work.

RealEstate,3c81kg,tipsystatistic,4,Sun Jul 5 20:43:17 2015 UTC,25% over asking. Holy cow.   I have no particular knowledge but  1) My last agent and contractor both seemed to think flippers cut too many corners. Lipstick on a pig was their general impression.   2) The appraisal needs to match the price or loan company will not touch. These rules are pretty strict because of the crazy shit going on in 2005. What does your agent say?
RealEstate,3c81kg,Crestylia,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:03:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was the only way I was getting in there. The Portland market is bananas.   1) I think there are good flippers and bad flippers. I bid on this one because it looks like a particularly good flip, as flips go - the work looks solid. But I'm not a supereducated buyer, so I'm looking for more advice.   2) I'm almost certain the appraisal will come in low, given the price of the house and the surrounding properties. Im just curious if there's anything I can do to get the sellers to agree to the appraised cost, rather than kick me out and try again for cash. My agent says to wait and see - the market is moving very quickly, who knows what the appraisal will be."
RealEstate,3c81kg,aardy,3,Sun Jul 5 20:10:13 2015 UTC,"Im just curious if there's anything I can do to get the sellers to agree to the appraised cost, rather than kick me out and try again for cash.   Maybe or maybe not, but if you can't then we can often structure things so you don't borrow more than you wanted and don't put more down than you wanted. ""We"" being most local lenders that have a little flexibility and agility, not necessarily B of A or Wells.  Suppose sales price of $500k, $100k down payment, and appraisal comes in at $460k.   First mortgage for $368k -- 80% of $460. 2nd mortgage at a higher interest rate for $32k -- 7% of $460k. Down payment: $100k. Still borrowing $400k. Still putting $100k down.    May need to extend escrow by a week or so because loan officer will not know they need to set a second up until the appraisal comes back.  $32k at a slightly higher interest rate is of course better than all $400k at a higher interest rate and/or $400k with PMI. There will be an interest rate pricing adjustment for subordinate financing, but it will be a shit ton less than 'coming in with the difference' between purchase price and appraised value.  Borrower is encouraged to pay down the HELOC 2nd as soon as possible, so they can be left with what is essentially an ""emergency use only"" credit card at an interest rate far below what credit card companies typically offer b/c it is secured by real estate."

The asking price was $239,000, which is on the high side of commensurate with the surrounding properties. I bid $301,000 and was initially outbid   My thought as I was reading this is I wonder if this is in Portland...yup.  As someone who is also looking in the same neighborhood/price range (the listed price that is), this is super depressing.  My friends recently bought a flipped house in that area. I went to help install a ceiling fan - and found a ton of electrical issues. Crumbling wires. The whole main floor and radon system were on a single circuit. Definitely not to code, even though they had definitely installed a new light. I think flippers know what is on the inspection checklist, so I think it's worth checking a few things that aren't standard to see if they look like solid work or just covering up for an inspection."
RealEstate,3c94n3,ghostiami,3,Mon Jul 6 01:31:00 2015 UTC,"You sound exactly like me. I bought my 3/2.5 place last October and have been renting out two rooms since then. A couple of quick tips:   Tenant screenings should include credit and background checks. I use biggerpockets.mysmartmove.com. I found all of my tenants on craigslist and subreddits specific to my area and personally interviewed them prior to running them through the website. Figure out a way to track your finances, especially tax deductions. With home ownership & tenants, the hardest thing for me to wrap my head around has been the fact that monthly cash flow and monthly change in net worth are far from the same thing. I use quicken rental property manager. It cost me ~$100 on amazon, and some people hate it, but it has been well worth it for me. Get familiar with the applicable state/federal tax requirements associated with rental income. I started by reading the following and then I got a $75 consultation with a tax professional to solidify my understanding. I do the taxes myself but the consultation was essential in helping me figure it all out. http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch09.html Have a conversation with your insurance company: what happens if a tenant gets hurt in your home? Take action to limit your liability as necessary. Ask your real estate agent if they can provide you with copies of the local/state realtor's association rental contract templates. Those templates are a good starting point for developing your own rental contract; the internet will help you gather additional information as well. In the end, an attorney is really the right person to help you develop your final contract."
RealEstate,3c94n3,h2oplo313,3,Mon Jul 6 02:42:18 2015 UTC,"I'm in a similar situation, however I rent a 3 bedroom from my landlord and in turn rent out the 2 other rooms (With his permission). Do all of the above. I'm a 30 yr old male and I have 2 mid 20's female room mates.  I actually prefer female room mates. They tend to keep things cleaner and we all generally communicate well if there is an issue either internally, or if we need to go to the building owner about something.  See which of your friends are good judges of character (if you're not).  Maybe have them meet your prospective room mates before you have them fill out an application."
RealEstate,3c94n3,Radiobamboo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:30:12 2015 UTC,Before tenants sign a lease- it's important they understand all the costs and conditions.

Typically you will need to be around to go to the notary's office and sign papers once the deal is finalized, but putting it up for sale is as easy as putting up a sign.

RealEstate,3c8fmq,lkenny76,5,Sun Jul 5 21:43:14 2015 UTC,"Whether you can get a mortgage on it or not will depend on the condition, and if it meets the GSE minimum property requirements/standards. Basically it can't need major repairs or anything that impacts the structure, safety, or security (value).   There are some exceptions such as FHA 203K but you will need a significant down payment. If you're in the military VA is probably your best bet for ease of financing and smallest down, but the place will need to be in decent shape. It can be ugly and dated, but all systems must work and not be at the end of their useful life.   If you're considering renting it out, take some time to search here, try ""landlord"" and ""tenant"" and see all the crazy stuff that can come up. This can be really difficult and expensive to manage remotely, especially if you're not experienced at this. Good luck."

I looked into the FHA 203k since they include funds to rehab as well as mortgage and require a 3.5% down,but apparently there is alot of red tape and paperwork involved.

RealEstate,3c8irc,legendia,3,Sun Jul 5 22:09:44 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to flip, why buy new construction at market value? Find something that needs work and pay a fraction of listing."
RealEstate,3c8irc,SynbiosVyse,2,Mon Jul 6 01:31:45 2015 UTC,"If you do want to turn around and sell quickly, it may be difficult when there's still construction going on in the neighborhood. Buyers who are not in a rush probably will want to build their own house. Or if the market is moving quick enough and people need houses yesterday, you may sell quickly.   Building in a new neighborhood is also a bit of a gamble should anything happen to the developer/builder. My neighborhood's original developer/builder backed out in 2008 when maybe 20% was built and only a little more developed. Things sat stagnant for 18 months until a new developer took over the neighborhood and found a builder. They finished an existing phase and did a whole new phase. Things picked up and got hot a couple years ago and the developer put the remaining phases out to bid so there's other builders finishing those. Long story short, the original vision and character of the neighborhood hasn't played out. Getting in early to a new neighborhood gives you more selection with lot location and if there's an HOA you can possibly get involved and positively influence things early on. Getting in late leaves you little choices, possibly higher prices, but then you are more sure what the whole neighborhood will look like and that it will indeed be finished."
RealEstate,3c8irc,roflomgwtfbbq,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:03:36 2015 UTC,"Consider that the sales agreements for new construction are written by attorneys working for the builder, and are very one-sided. You may be able to get them to budge on some things, but not if the market is hot. The market value dropping is not a reason (in the contracts I've seen) to pull out, and some builders around here have been known to threaten people with a suit for specific performance if they try that.   Contracts DO usually say that you have to be able to obtain financing, so, in theory, if the market drops, you would have an out. But most people use the builder's lender and guess what? Their appraiser ""Ray Charles"" doesn't notice that the market has dropped. Lower comps? What lower comps? It's FINE!!! They'll still make that loan, no matter what the value is.   I know one person who got out of a contract on a new build when the market was tanking hard in 2008/2009. The way she did this was ask the lender (the builder's lender) for a copy of her loan file. They sent it to her, and lo and behold, they had lied about her income and overstated it something like 100% in order to qualify her for the new house, while she still owned her old one. I think she'd given them a $35,000 deposit (it was a nice house). Important to note that SHE had not lied, the lender had fudged the numbers to make things work. She pointed this ""discrepancy"" out to them, and threatened to report them to HUD, OTS, OCC, FHFA, and our state banking authorities. She got her deposit back and they let her out of the contract. But if she hadn't figure that out, she could have been out $35K. I think the house was about $100K upside down when it got close to being complete. But seriously, why would a builder volunteer to let you out of a contract to buy a place for X dollars when if they let you out, they'll have to sell it for X - Y dollars. They're not going along with that plan.   Think carefully, make sure you are buying for the longterm and not just for an immediate anticipated gain. This is no different that gambling, and you're betting with a lot more money than you'd wager in Vegas."
RealEstate,3c8irc,wamazing,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:00:16 2015 UTC,"In the event that the home appreciates, you'll be looking at a good deal when the home is finally complete which would make it easier to cash flow or to flip.    First of all I like that you are thinking of investing in real estate. I think it's a great tool. But I wanted to make some comments.  Regarding buy and hold:   Cash flow only factors in expenses and income, has absolutely nothing to do with purchase price or appreciation. You make money from cash flow for buy and hold, and occasional refinance cash out loans to use for buying more properties. Don't count on appreciation for buy and hold. Calculate the detailed cahsflow before buying.  Flipping:  I'm not a flipper so I don't think I have any specific advice, but I think your assumption is off base too. It might appreciate, but you are straight gambling if you are counting on it. Flippers buy houses (all rehab included) at 70% of today's retail value just to ensure a healthy profit. Holding costs, sales commissions, insurance, unexpected time on the market, cost of money, and all that stuff eats a portion of the profit that would be made.

RealEstate,3c771r,FahCough,15,Sun Jul 5 14:53:37 2015 UTC,"I ask for this. The service I used to do background checks can also give a rating on the likelihood of the account over drafting. (Bouncing.) I don't know how accurate it is, and I'm in the process of moving to a different service, but it can be legitimate.  Also, anybody you have ever written a check to has your bank routing and account numbers. Those numbers are not private. Don't give them to random people, but they're not as secure as... say... social security."
RealEstate,3c771r,ethidda,2,Sun Jul 5 18:42:29 2015 UTC,"If the landlord insists on electronic payment,  ask for his account info and set up an automatic deposit."

RealEstate,3c771r,alchemy3083,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:17:29 2015 UTC,"It's unusual.  It's different because SSN and other details are used to run a background check.  Bank account #s aren't needed for a landlord to run any sort of credit/criminal/tenancy check.  There is, in fact, nothing legal the landlord can do with the account number, without additional permission from the lessee.  (e.g. balance inquiry or ACH withdrawal.)  If the landlord cannot do anything legal with this voided check, one must assume the landlord either (1) has no need for this item, or (2) intends to use this item to break the law."
RealEstate,3c771r,landlordmike,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:34:38 2015 UTC,The landlord wants the bank info to levy the account when the rent is unpaid. Perfectly legit.
RealEstate,3c771r,alchemy3083,2,Sun Jul 5 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"There's no reason I can imagine for a landlord to ask for a voided check except as part of the process for setting up an ACH withdrawal from that checking account.  Legally, he can't set up such a transaction without your explicit written permission, but if he was asking for a voided check and not asking you to sign off on a direct debit agreement, I'd take that as an indication he felt OK with forging an ACH authorization from you and raiding your bank account at his leisure.  Due to the weakness of the direct withdrawal system - where banks assume anyone who requests money from your account must be doing so with your permission - it's a good idea to guard your account # and never give a check drawn on that account to anyone who gives you reason to distrust them."

RealEstate,3c771r,wamazing,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:20:33 2015 UTC,"The application doesn't have your bank routing number and account number on it. It's safe if the landlord is an honest person. But an honest person doesn't need that info unless the tenant is requesting to pay rent electronically. And that would normally be arranged after the tenant has been accepted.   The only reason the landlord wants this info is to go after the tenant's money if rent is late or otherwise not paid. And the landlord has other legal means to pursue a deadbeat tenant, they don't need my bank account info.   I would not rent from this landlord."
RealEstate,3c7nun,optikalefx,2,Sun Jul 5 17:40:25 2015 UTC,"I'm confused about a few things...  Is the landlord making the payments on the home or is he pocketing your rent & not paying the mortgage?  Because if he's making the payments, he'll have to qualify for a ""financial hardship"" to be granted an approval for a short sale. And most banks won't do squat for approvals when payments are being made.  Second thought: you really need to dial in your comps. A $70k+ swing on a sub-$300k home tells me something is off with the comps that are being presented. Where/how were your comps obtained?  Third thought: Short sales are not the fire-sales they used to be. The are real estate approval transactions that are managed by people who have no real estate experience & typically, don't give a flying fuck about their job or you. Banks/servicers don't let go of homes for pennies on the dollar as they've wised up & they're handled in a manner that leaves less room for a steal of a deal that we saw early on in the whole collapse debacle.   Fourth thought: (because, why not?) Most banks/servicers require that the transaction be ""arms length"" between the parties. Some banks will accept you, as the renter, buying the home, some will not. Find that info out up front to save yourself the potential heartache."
RealEstate,3c7nun,ShinyLightning,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:41:07 2015 UTC,"1) I have no clue if he's pocketing the money, i'm apparently not supposed to talk to the seller about this directly so I don't have a way to find out  2) Comparables are my own research. Zillow says 227-285.  Because we are just starting the process They haven't done the appraisal yet.  4) who would I ask? their bank or my bank?"
RealEstate,3c7nun,wastelandavenger,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:33:53 2015 UTC,"The bank is the only one who knows the magic number that they will assign for the short sale. Take a guess and make an offer. But keep in mind, some employees in a room will make the decision, not an individual. Don't expect the bank to negotiate with you like an individual would."
RealEstate,3c7nun,ShortWoman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"Last time I did an FHA short, it was 88% of the appraised price (not a mere BPO) after accounting for all concessions, including commissions (bottom line to the bank, not top). And as Shiny pointed out, the seller still has to demonstrate a hardship. That's harder to do if the rent is covering the mortgage.  Ignore the tax assessment. That number is for tax purposes and might or might not have anything to do with the market value.  Dial in the comps, only look at SOLD properties within 1 mile of you that have the same number of beds, baths, and garage spaces and are within a few hundred square feet in size.  Just because they can't put up a sign doesn't mean they can't advertise it. They can still put it in the MLS or even Craigslist with a note saying ""currently rented; no viewings until your offer is accepted.""  TLDR: make an offer in line with your revised comps, because that's what the appraisal (or BPO) will be based on. Be prepared for a long wait, only to have the bank do things that seem strange. And still, don't count on the deal going through.  Good luck."
RealEstate,3c7nun,ShortWoman,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:11:08 2015 UTC,"So i spent more time on the comps and i get around 227-258 for features that are close.  When you say ""after accounting for all concessions"". What are those concessions? Does that include my 10k closing costs?"
RealEstate,3c7nun,kevinsells,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:39:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, if you ask the ""seller"" to cover them.   The bank is looking at how much money they take in when everything is said and done, accounting for agent commissions, title/escrow costs, attorney/notary fees, and the whole nine yards. Obviously, if you pay your own closing costs, the bank makes more money."
RealEstate,3c7nun,kevinsells,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:53:49 2015 UTC,"FHA Pre-Foreclosure sale net sales prices are driven by an FHA As-is Appraisal and a BPO/AVM. In most cases the Lender will use the Appraisal to determine the net. Within the first 30 days after the Homeowner is issued what is called an Approval to Participate the Lender is to only accept a Contract that nets no less than 88% of said Appraisal, then 86% 30 days later and then finally a floor of 84% 30 days thereafter until the Approval to Participate expires."

RealEstate,3c79dp,newlyfast,5,Sun Jul 5 15:18:16 2015 UTC,"Leave this in the hands of your agent, communicate only through writing from agent to agent.   This is very cut and dried, if it's agreed in the contract, it must be done. I wouldn't leave knob and tube in a house; I'd either have it removed myself after the purchase or negotiate it into the deal like you did.   Ask your electrician to prepare a quote (NOT an estimate) and reduce your offer by that much. At this point I'd be skeptical about having their sparky do the work at all."
RealEstate,3c79dp,Going_Live,6,Sun Jul 5 15:53:01 2015 UTC,"As a listing agent, I don't want my seller exposed to a high priced repair only to have the buyer walk.  As a buyers agent, I don't want the seller doing a half assed job that Im going to get a phone call about after closing.  The solution?  List price relief!  IMO, I would leave knob and tube alone and update after closing.  An electrician friend told me, knob and tube was a good more balanced system.  Roofs are expensive, go for list price relief."
RealEstate,3c79dp,PhredPhnerd,4,Sun Jul 5 17:05:18 2015 UTC,"An electrician friend told me, knob and tube was a good more balanced system.   ""More balanced"" meaning what?  There is absolutely no benefit to K&T; it's a 130-year-old technology that came about at the same time as the development of household electrical generation.  It was perfectly fine for the standards of the day - in fact, extraordinarily safe compared to piping coal gas (with around 10% carbon monoxide) into every room you wanted a light.  But it fails to meet current expectations and standards for power delivery and safety and (in the US) its use in existing construction is very limited, and in new construction, forbidden.  On one hand, I'd like to tell you that bringing a house up to proper electrical code just means the next buyer can't complain about it, so it's not wasted money.  On the other, I realize that just means the next buyer asks the same concessions for the roof.  Or the galvanized water pipe.  Or the cast iron or clay sanitary lines.  Or...  So yeah, price relief.  :)"
RealEstate,3c79dp,alchemy3083,2,Sun Jul 5 22:56:20 2015 UTC,I've heard the same from an electrician friend as well.  Thanks for the tip!

RealEstate,3c79dp,ShortWoman,3,Sun Jul 5 18:20:31 2015 UTC,"Is the wiring active or just the disconnected remains of the old electrical system?    Is your lender or insurer aware of this?  Many hazard insurance policies consider even disconnected knob-and-tube high-risk, and will have very firm requirements about its inspection and removal before or shortly after closing.   They are now saying their electrician has certified the knob and tube to be safe, and that replacing it would be costly and pointless.    I'd be tempted to ask them to read back your written contingency of ""remove all knob and tube"" and highlight the sections where you wrote ""so long as it isn't expensive"" and ""unless it's pointless.""  Because I'm pretty sure those terms weren't in the agreement."
RealEstate,3c79dp,alchemy3083,3,Sun Jul 5 17:29:01 2015 UTC,"This is the correct answer.   I do recall once considering an older house, so I called my insurance guy to ask what to be careful about. The only thing he specifically mentioned was NO knob-and-tube, that I would never get coverage for that through a standard carrier. So yeah, blame your insurance guy if you have to."
RealEstate,3c79dp,Corporal_Rodney,2,Sun Jul 5 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding that the knob and tube is integrated into the current system. I mainly serves the light switches and ceiling fans on the second floor, not pulling major voltage. The rest of the house is wired through modern wiring.  I am tempted to read back the document they signed as well!"
RealEstate,3c79dp,Corporal_Rodney,2,Sun Jul 5 18:19:18 2015 UTC,"A partial rewire like that isn't unusual.  In case you need further motivation to see this through: Let's assume the K&T is in perfect shape, properly junctioned to modern NM wiring and your main breaker panel.  Congrats, you have no immediate risk of fire; the second-floor wiring is done with the finest electrical technology the 1880s had to offer.  But let's say you're not a hardcore steampunk fan, and you want a level of electrical service and safety that meets your 21st century lifestyle.  K&T doesn't deliver that.  You likely have no more than 1 or 2 outlets per room upstairs.  They are likely all on a single 10 or 15 amp breaker.  They are all either ungrounded or improperly grounded, which has inherent risk of fire and injury.  K&T isn't inherently dangerous, but it's a risk, and you mitigated that risk by requiring its removal.  Your judgment was completely reasonable.    If you demand the cost of removal, meaning you purchase the house while the K&T is still connected, I strongly suggest you make your insurer aware.  In the unlikely event there is a fire between closing and the K&T removal, you do not want your insurer to have a reason to refuse the claim."
RealEstate,3c79dp,wamazing,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:30:57 2015 UTC,I am tempted to read back the document they signed as well!   Why would you only be 'tempted' to reread that agreement? That should have been the first thing you do before you posted here.
RealEstate,3c5q8l,galaxydown,10,Sun Jul 5 01:48:17 2015 UTC,"Just being honest when I see FSBO I will do just about anything to avoid dealing with you.  The only time I will bring a FSBO house to the attention of my clients is if there is no comparable house avail and I feel ethically obligated.  That's about it.  Or if I have show them every other house on the market. This is because 95% of the time in my area FSBO translates to pain in the ass.  (Edit: forget the commission aspect. I could care less if they are offering 4 points even. I know that by the time I am done it will feel like I have worked 3 deals.)   So I can't speak for everybody else but ime, in my area, going FSBO cuts your potential buyers substantially.    However that's not all bad.  There are other people, like you, who will come look at your property.  You may meet another former RE guy who is just looking to skip on the commission and things work out great.    My advice to you would be if you have the time to sit on it, try FSBO for six moths."
RealEstate,3c5q8l,Riglin4096,3,Sun Jul 5 02:41:36 2015 UTC,"See, that's my biggest fear... realtors avoiding the place. I'm not sure how common it is with all the sites (Zillow, Trulia, Realtor.com, etc) where a buyer brings a property to their realtor to show. For the 2 houses I've bought + this one we are trying to buy, we found it and brought our realtor in. My friends all seemed to have found their own houses with searching (probably not a good sample as a lot are in real estate).  I am guessing we are not the norm though."
RealEstate,3c5q8l,Riglin4096,5,Sun Jul 5 02:47:30 2015 UTC,"IME it's very typical for buyer to come to me with a property and I will take them to see it.  Many times just to meet them and see what they are looking for even if there is no commission involved.  If they say we love it I direct them to the owner and bow out. I'll even throw them some free advice and answer a few phone or email questions.  I find being awesome to people in general works out well in the long run.    However most of the time that falls through in one way or another, and I am there waiting with comps.  I would give a wild estimate that 1% of buyers would seriously consider FSBO.  It's just inherently scary shit for most people.  It's changing your own brakes.  Just about anybody can do it, but if you fuck up, you could die."

I've never avoided FSBO for monetary reasons, it's just usually a PITA.  Which is bad for me, and bad for my clients.  Why would I introduce them to a rocky road when they can have a smooth one.    However if you can get across to the local firms that it will be smooth sailing, why not.  If you want to DIY your side of the deal and monetize your skills why not?     I think agents should be for people who want agents & are willing to pay for them.  I don't think they should be an obligation.  However, and the problem we aren't supposed to discuss is that most people who go FSBO make a terrible name for FSBO.    People like to make the agents out to be the reason you can't go FSBO.  However the reality is typically it's owners that give it a bad name.  Maybe you can be the FSBO guy that makes the word less dirty."

Sounds like a great person.   On the flip side, there are agents out there that specialize in handoff listings - they handle clerical issues, you do the rest. Usually under a grand all-in. Your listing doesn't say FSBO and slimy agents like this guy generally have no idea. With the saved money, hire a real estate photographer with a drone. Your photos might be better than average, but a real photog will sell the house online.   I've sold FSBO & with agent back and forth in the past few years.

Alternately, you could have an appraiser work up a price for around $300 or so.  Once you establish a fair price, market the crap out of the home. Get some professional signs made. Put up directional signs. Spend some money advertising. Get it on every web site you can find. You'll get your money back 10 fold over paying a commission. Be prepared with the paperwork you'll need to make it easy for potential buyers to make an offer: offer forms, disclosure forms, contract for sale, plot plan, lead disclosure forms, any other forms required by state and/or local laws in your area.

RealEstate,3c5q8l,honesttennesseeagent,3,Tue Jul 14 17:56:18 2015 UTC,"Just sold our house.  Started off as FSBO and got a little interest but most serious buyers will have an agent and they are not monitoring FSBO listings.    We ended up doing a ""fixed fee"" listing service where you can get your house posted on MLS.  You will also need to pay the buyers agent 3% to essentially get the people in your door.   You then have to pay a fixed fee of anywhere from $500 - $3,000 to the listing agent (depending on how many services you want from them).     I would highly suggest this if you are in a desirable area.   If you are in a tougher part of the country to sell a house then you might really need a creative seller's agent working for you but in a hot market I think having a fair selling price and good photos posted on MLS will be enough to get your house sold."

You prefer there to be at least one agent for the buyer to make sure that things go smoothly. That means that you recognize that there are parts of the process that you wouldn't know how to handle.   That means when issues come up, you are banking on that other agent 1. being competent and 2. not taking advantage of you. In reality, most of the work that agents do happens after a contract is signed and other agents can do some really weird things.   I would talk with your friend and get them to list it for 1% or 2% since you do so much business together. If you already know how to price your house, it won't matter that he is unfamiliar with your area. You want him to protect you once you are under contract."

I am confident I can navigate through the process plus I do have multiple people who work for me who do have their state license. I want to make sure the buyer understands the process and I doubt they are as sophisticated in real estate in general as I am. I don't want to have to explain to a buyer why they need a pre approval or proof of funds or a deposit or any other item they will need. I am willing to pay someone else to deal with that BS. :)
RealEstate,3c5q8l,honesttennesseeagent,2,Sun Jul 5 22:05:42 2015 UTC,In my experience that is not the case.  Most buyers are doing their own searching online and if they see your house show up in the area they are looking at they will ask their broker to show it.  If they are getting 3% and their buyers want to see the house I really can't imagine them somehow trying to steer the buyers away.  It would be unethical and against their own self interest (lost commission).
RealEstate,3c4tls,quan1979,8,Sat Jul 4 20:08:40 2015 UTC,"undeveloped land is a tough sell in a down economy, and Memphis, TN is not exactly a hot bed of growth, unless you head south to Mississippi where DeSoto county is sucking in all the development money in the area.   Much depends on how the land is currently zoned, and how expensive would it be to develop it for commercial or residential use.   Before I'd commit to any sales campaign, you're going to have to do some research on zoning, utilities, taxes, allowed usage, etc.   Some other things to look at are flood zones, internet access, transportation infrastructure, and how much sway the politics of the golf course has over nearby development. Yes, local small town politics holds great power over development."

RealEstate,3c4tls,WinnieThePig,2,Sun Jul 5 01:20:20 2015 UTC,"What is the highest and best use for the land? If you (or the owner or realtors) don't know that, you're just spitting into the wind. Figure out the most likely use (based on the financials involved in each scenario you can envision and what's allowed or likely under zoning) and then market it to your ideal buyer.   Land is one of the most difficult and risky things to appraise. Can take a lot of work. You need really good access to data and an solid understanding of the dynamics of the local market. I'm not sure I'd suggest getting an appraisal because, you're probably going to do just as well for a lot less money with an experienced agent. Hopefully your agents have experience selling vacant land and working with developers in the area?   But generally if something isn't getting a lot of interest it's very likely overpriced."

RealEstate,3c3q4i,djpossess,13,Sat Jul 4 13:56:18 2015 UTC,Rejoice the appraisal didn't come in low. Nothing do if it comes in high.   Now you wait for final loan approval. The underwriter may ask for more documentation. Then they will issue your loan documents. You sign them and bring in your cash to close.

RealEstate,3c3q4i,wamazing,7,Sat Jul 4 16:29:13 2015 UTC,"First, don't let the seller or their agent know what the appraisal came back at. It's confidential information for the lender to make a lending decision. Seller has no rights to the appraisal. If anyone asks just say it is ""fine."" Probably not a huge issue with only $2K but a seller who thinks they left money on the table isn't going to be as cooperative if any issues come up between now and closing.   Kitchens are expensive, any way you cut it. Although painting cabinets can be done DIY and turn out OK, they're not going to look as good as professionally finished ones, because the pro ones use a lacquer based paint not the paint you can get at home depot.  You're not going to get that furniture quality look with regular paint.   As an appraiser, I'm going to have a tough time giving painted cabinets the same value as new ones. A lot of this is market dependent, in some entry-level areas where homes are 60 years old it's very common to paint them. But in general, buyers can tell when someone took a cheap shortcut and it's going to be reflected in an appraisal. Maybe you don't care, if you're going to be there for years, if this is something you buy you some time, I wouldn't say don't do it. Just food for thought.   I have seen some Ikea cabinets that look great, with a nice stone slab for countertops you can get a lot of bang for the buck that way.   Also consider that the finish of the cabinets is not the only thing contributing to the look of a place. Cabinet styles change. If you go for new cabinets they are going to be current design and look and will look fresher than old repainted cabinets. Although a classic design is going to be very appealing, there isn't anything that isn't going to look its age in 20 or 30 years.   Can't help you with any direct questions about the UW, sorry. Good luck and congrats on the house!"

RealEstate,3c3q4i,wamazing,2,Sat Jul 4 14:59:30 2015 UTC,"I just bought a house and the kitchen needs to be redone.  We don't have much cash left, so I was planning on just replacing the appliances for now so my wife can cook.  Is there any part of the kitchen I can DIY without it needing to be redone when we replace the cabinets?  For example, I was thinking of getting a granite counter top with the expectation that it can be reused when we have the cabinets torn out and replaced (assuming, of course, that the footprint remains the same)."
RealEstate,3c3q4i,ornothumper,2,Sat Jul 4 15:39:05 2015 UTC,"Countertop can definitely be re-used (carefully...)  if the size is the same. But there can be a lot of variables, size-wise, so, consider that if you have custom cabinets now, you'll probably need customs later. If you are hoping to do ready-made cabinets later, shop around for sizes now just so you don't inadvertently back yourself into a corner later.   And I'm not saying painting the cabinets is a terrible idea. They did it once on This Old House and the homeowner did it herself, and she did a great job. That episode might be around online for anyone wondering what the pitfalls are and how much work it is (I think she said she did 4 coats of paint with sanding between each). So if a full kitchen reno is 10 years off and the cabinets you have are ugly as sin and you really hate them, painting them is not a bad idea if it makes you happier.   It's just not going to get you the same $$$ when you sell or on an appraisal."

RealEstate,3c1hqt,wmurray003,10,Fri Jul 3 22:07:44 2015 UTC,"Howdy, /u/wmurray003  Standard ""hey guys, I'm not being shady"" disclosure: I own/operate a rental application site that does tenant screening reports (e.g. credit & background checks).  Don't worry, I won't push my own thing though because I really believe there are tons of great reasons to pick other companies too, depending on what you need.    @ FIRST, A QUICK DUMP WITH LIGHT DESCRIPTIONS   https://www.zumper.com/ -- Growing like wildfire. Very well funded.  Everyone thinks they're just a listing site (that's how they started), but they also do applications/tenant screening (since March 2015).  I tried this out recently and found it quite impressive.  Clean interface, very good looking credit report. I believe it's just credit (no criminal or eviction reports). https://cozy.co/ -- Well funded by A list investors (you can google them). They run credit reports through Experian. Not clear to me that they do background (criminal) checks. One of the best UI/UX in the game. They also do rent payments, which might be important to you. http://www.rentobo.com/ -- YCombinator backed company, been around a bit.  They use Transunion reports.  Also do listings. https://www.rentalutions.com/ - full cycle property management.  This team went to Plug & Play Ventures incubator last year. Nice founders.  Basically, they'll do rent application, lease signing, tenant management, rent payments, and your tax documents. http://www.rentscreener.com/rental-application -- This is pretty recent, and they're not really part of the normal startup/tech scene.  Affiliated with Khova, which has been in the real estate business for a long time. I believe they do listings through another site and might actually have a Consumer Reporting Agency that backs their reports. https://www.easytenantapproval.com/ -- This has popped up on my radar recently, but I haven't tried it yet. From what I can tell, it looks like it uses the same mechanism to pull credit reports from Experian (Experian Connect) as Zumper and Cozy do.  https://www.rentapplication.net/ -- My own company.  Differentiating factors: our applications are customizable.  We make it possible for landlords to charge an extra processing fee for applications.   A few that popped up when I just googled. I don't know anything about these, but hey why not, to be comprehensive:   http://www.onlinetenantapp.com/onlinecredit/ http://www.tenanttech.com/online-application/     @ SECOND, HOW I WOULD ADVISE SOMEONE TO CHOOSE THE BEST FIT  Based on your personal preferences/needs, it's totally sane to pick a different company than someone with different needs.  This section is about breaking out the decision criteria so you can map them to your own preferences and get the best thing for yourself.  A. Price.  First, note that if you're just processing applications for one property, you probably won't end up paying for anything yourself.  The applicant is going to shoulder the burden.   The cheapest will be Zumper, weighing in at $10 for an Experian credit report. After that, my site, Rent Application, at $19.95 for the same Experian credit report. (You can add on criminal or eviction for $10 each, but that puts me at 29.95 for credit+criminal) After that, Rentobo at $35 for credit+criminal After that, Cozy.co at $39.90 for credit+ criminal ($19.95 each) After that, Rentalutions at $45 for credit + criminal. After that, it looks like Easy Tenant Approval at $40 for just credit (add on criminal for another 4.99)   I don't know about pricing for the others.  Rentscreener is the fancy new part of an older company that does this for professional real estate management companies, so I suspect they will have access to cheaper pricing, but it probably won't be very transparent.  B. Ease of signing up  With Zumper, Rent Application, Rentobo, Cozy, and Rentalutions, & Easy Tenant Approval (listed in the same order as the pricing above), you'll be able to sign up or get an application and credit report within 20 minutes.  With the other listed ones, you have to send in an email and somehow get an account provisioned.  C. Coverage for other landlord responsibilities  As an independent landlord, you probably need to do more than just take an application and run a credit report.  For full service stuff, in order:   Rentalutions offers the most coverage of the full life cycle of a landlord tenant relationship: listing, rental application credit check, digital lease, etc.  They're the most feature complete list in the group by a mile. After that, Cozy application/screening + rent payments Zumper and Rentobo both offer listings (helping you syndicate/publish availability/market) and application/screening.  Since you are asking about applications, I'm assuming you're past caring about listing.  Plus, I think listings is barely a feature worth talking about so it shouldn't sway your decision on application software (just use Craigslist).  Zumper wins against Rentobo though outside this category (cheaper, same features) Rent Application (mine) and Easy Tenant Approval just do application/screening.  So if having add on services like rent payment and lease signings in the same app is important, then you shouldn't choose my offering.  If you don't care, then between Rent Application and Easy Tenant Approval, you should pick Rent Application though (cheaper, more features like customizability and letting landlords set processing fees to make their own money when receiving applications).   D. Screening report offering  Everything above is mostly about CREDIT reports.  You might also care about background checks (criminal reports), eviction histories (civil suits) and other stuff.  If so, again, from best to worst:   Rent Application -- Yay, I'm winning at something.  Off the rack, we offer credit, criminal, eviction.  However, on request we can also do employment verification, previous landlord verification, bank statement confirmation (don't do this though, it's a waste of money and applicants hate it), and if you have a report type that you WANT, we can probably get it for you. Rent Screener -- OK, actually they're probably the same as us in this category.  I think they're backed by a CRA or partnered with a CRA, so they probably have access to everything under the sun.  But it's so damn opaque I don't know what they actually offer.  Also, it appears that the sample report in their pictures is a credit summary (A-F rating) rather than a credit score (like a FICO score, e.g. 780).  This is typical for non-professional companies or people who haven't been sufficiently underwritten to get access to credit reports (CRA compliance stuff imposed by the credit bureaus). Easy Tenant Approval -- Credit + Criminal + Eviction.  But the priciest on credit @ $40.00 above. Rentobo, Cozy, Rentalutions -- Credit + Criminal. Same across the 3.  You'll have to pick by another criteria if you're down to these 3. Zumper -- Credit only. Yay! They're the worst at something! Zumper is kind of awesome though really. Great UI and cheap.  But if you want a criminal and eviction report, you'll need to pick something else.   E. Other features  OK, I'm creating a whole section for myself, because hey I wrote this whole thing and nobody is stopping me!   We're not the cheapest (Zumper) We don't have the most things you can do (Rentalutions) Ok, we're probably tied with any real CRA for the most types of reports you can run, but as an independent landlord myself, I can verify that I don't care about that so you probably don't.   So why are we any good at all? The reasons you might pick us are if you care about:   Application customizability - We'll give you a standard application, but there's a drag and drop builder that lets you change/remove/add questions and sections.  I don't think anyone else does that. Pick your own application link, like www.rentapplication.net/wmurray003.  Pro landlords and agents probably care more about that. Add your own application processing fee.  Your time is important (maybe?). So if you can tack on an extra $10 processing fee.  OK, pros probably care more about that too.   So really, for an independent landlord, maybe the best reason to pick us is customizability.  If you don't care about that, then I'd recommend looking at price (Zumper, if you're ok with just credit) or lifecycle coverage (Rentalutions, but they charge after the first unit -- everything else is free for you).  F. Support  If phone support is critical to you, the only companies in the group that list phone numbers are:   Rentobo Easy Tenant Approval Tenant Tech     @ OTHER STUFF  We only do one thing (applications).  I'm a landlord myself. don't mind using different services for different things instead of having one service that does it all. I use RentShare.com for my rent payments (also I like the founders).  I also answered a thread a while back about rent payment options: https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1z9o9w/electronic_rent_collection/  So if you're considering breaking things up into different services, then I'd recommend that team for payments (but of course, read all the options!)  Happy landlording.  Man, I wrote this instead of taking a nap.  I'm going to be so tired when I try to go out tonight."

MySmartMove is the service operated by TransUnion.  Honestly, it's been over 2 years since I've last looked at it, but:   At the time I didn't think their UI was very good. I don't like how they force you to enter property details in order to get an application (that's now how real world applications work).  Though in fairness, several other companies I listed do that as well. At least Rentobo, probably Rentalutions too. Zumper does not. Cozy used to at least, but I think a few months back they stopped doing that. Rent Application used to but we moved off that a year or so ago also. IIRC they don't actually provide an actual credit score (a credit summary or recommendation, much like the RentScreener description I provided above). It's direct from the bureau and it's not even the cheapest.  And even at that price point they provide worse reports (if I'm right about it being a credit summary).   Anyways, real reason is that I forgot.  And I haven't reviewed it recently, but in my recollection, it's a worst option than most of the above (or at least it's not better in any dimensions that are useful)."

In my previous company we would hand out the rental application form first. Usually done online or on paper after an open house, but mostly online.   After that we would briefly look over their applications and ask for their supporting documents can include your W2 of last year, recent bank statement, last two pay stubs and a copy of driver licence or ID.  The next step would be seeing if your income is substantial for the rental unit. Most company from what I know would have the monthly income be 2.5 to 3 times the rent.   Once that checks out we would run a credit check and landlord verification. If all is good, arrange a date to sign the lease and for the new tenants to hand over their first month rent and security deposit.   Hopefully that answer your question a bit."

Popular among post-windfall investors.    You see the property you want, listed for $215k. This is REALLY the property you want, so you offer $225 as an all-cash buyer. Sellers LOVE to see ""all cash buyer,"" so might take this offer over a $235k offer with a one month close of escrow. You close, get the keys, and have the house. At this point, you pull most of that $225k right back out and get a mortgage.  Find somewhere that the $180k or so will earn better than the interest rate on the new mortgage.

When people say things like ""I'm worried about being priced out of the market,"" I hear ""we are in a bubble."" Zillow estimates of price appreciation are based on the notoriously unreliable Zillow listings and ""Zestimates,"" so I wouldn't use that number as anything more than a guess. And finally, never base your budget on future raises that may not pan out. Oh, and never fall in love with a property you don't own. Too much can happen between seeing a pretty picture on the internet and getting the keys.  The case for: well, if you do have the income and the downpayment to afford the place right now -- without ""stretching"" or being ""house poor"" or completely depleting your savings (these are important points!) -- why not? You'll have the transaction over and done with and if prices increase, you'll have more equity. Plus you'll get the tax breaks started this tax year rather than next.  TLDR: I can't predict the future, but if I were going to spend $370,000, I would want to be in a strong position rather than a fearful one.  Good luck!"

I would not advise anyone to buy for the short term. We've seen, a couple times now, that markets can swing up and down. You might get lucky, you might lose some money. You gotta make 6% just to pay the agents. I'm surprised we haven't seen higher interest rates before now, pretty much all the conventional wisdom says it's going to happen, and when it does, it will drive prices down.   I don't think we're going to see any major hikes before the next national election. But after that? Lots of unknowns.   I'd really encourage you to try to rent. The best way to approach a seller about renting is to pay them well enough to persuade them to change their plans for you. Some of them won't be able to some will need the money for their next place.   Call as many agents as you can in the area and let them know what you're looking for. You don't have to commit to working with any particular agent, just offer them a finder's fee, if you rent something they suggest. Realtors have networks. Call any property management companies. If this is a work situation, will your employer help with a employee relocation company? You have options, I'd really encourage you to explore them all before you buy something.   If you do buy something, make sure it's something that you think you can rent down the road, if you need to."

RealEstate,3c3011,FaulkofSeagulls,6,Sat Jul 4 07:20:48 2015 UTC,"Since you are on the mortgage, call up the lender and explain the situation. When I got divorced, my lender willingly took my ex off the loan  with just a phone call, maybe I had to sign something but it wasn't a refi. That was pre-crash so, rules might have changed since them. But you still have quite a few legal rights that go along with being on the mortgage. The lender will explain the options they have at their disposal.   The second thing you should do is, put all that, shewasacheatingho stuff out of your mind, she's now someone you have a business deal with, and keep focused on the finances. You need to talk to her, politely and objectively, and let her know you want to be taken off the mortgage. She'd probably prefer you not be on it as well, but she doesn't think she has options and she's not motivated to do anything. In some areas values have been going up in the last year, she might not be underwater any more. Communicating through her brother is not acceptable here, you either need to write her a nice letter and ask her to call you, or just call her yourself. I would not show up over there unannounced.   I'd tell her that I am going to hire an attorney to represent me, and, I'll do everything I can to make sure she can keep the house. If there is any equity, I'd even give it to her since that's just timing not because you've been paying the mortgage for 7 years. Just let her have it. But if she is not willing to cooperate, I will go to court to force a sale, and that might mean she has to move. But many areas have been increasing in value so you might be surprised, you may not be underwater any longer.   Depending on what the lender tells you, I'd spend a couple hundred bucks on an attorney for a consultation and find out your options.  I'd be inclined to get a real estate attorney, not a family law attorney, but, that's your choice.   You're lucky she's been making the payment this whole time. Make sure you thank her for preserving your credit and your ability to buy a house in the near future. She could have totally screwed you over and in some states the lender could come after you for any balance due, and you'd find your checks garnished and be looking at tens of thousands of dollars you owe. This little nightmare is nothing, compared to what you might have been dealing with. Good luck."

RealEstate,3c3011,junegloom,2,Sun Jul 5 13:51:33 2015 UTC,"Its an underwater home, so if anything you'd have to pay her to get off of the mortgage I would think. I believe how it works normally when splitting assets is say you have a house currently appraising for 300k, there's 200k left on the loan balance, you get divorced, the person being bought out is owed 150k, their share of the debt is also 100k, so effectively you buy them off for 50k, and in return you get a whole house and the whole debt. On an underwater home, lets say the house is currently worth 200k and the outstanding balance is 300k. Presumably you bought it for even more than 300k, but that's whats currently left on the balance. Your half of the debt is 150k and your half of the house is worth 100k, so you'd have to pay her 50k to make it fair to take you off the mortgage. You haven't been living in the house, but you haven't been making payments either, she's been making the payments in exchange for having full use of the house I guess. She's been chipping away at your portion of the debt, but whatever it still is currently, is something you owe if you want to get off the mortgage. Its a loan you took out and received property for in return, the loan has to be paid."

Make connections with your local Community Development office, Economic Development office, and anything like a chamber of commerce that might be pushing for new business in the area.

RealEstate,3c2j5b,flipht,2,Sat Jul 4 04:33:16 2015 UTC,"In my area, the subsidies are for affordable housing. Commercial development gets tax breaks (and often large ones) because they create jobs but in some areas, those have to be very good paying jobs.  There was recently an article in the newspaper here about a woman who was fighting the city because they were not going to give her the tax break she was promised when she built a building on her land, because the jobs there were not higher paying jobs. That city wants to encourage higher end tech employment, and she was not much above minimum wage.   I have friend who work on large infrastructure development, and those are contracts sent out for bid by various municipalities. They have an advantage and win a lot of those contracts because they are a registered DBE (but that boils down to tax break as well, no subsidies involved).   Basically you have to figure out how construction is done in your local area, who the players are, and how they operate. I'd start with city council meeting minutes, general plan discussions etc. Read the local business papers. Find a new project that's similar to what you want to do and trace back its origin in public records and find out how it came about."

Also it would be nice if the kids were clothed and no dart wars were going on and nobody was stinking up the bathroom when people randomly walked in.   I literally just asked for a few hours notice before each visit and not just ""maybe 1 hour"". I also even came up with a time frame that we could make available Monday - Friday and no notice would be needed (a suggestion from someone else on here) and then just notices on the weekends to make sure the house is reasonable and that I can be awake and dressed.   But she denied both requests and said I need to have it available and perfect 8am-9pm every day with little to no notice and that I need to be dressed and not sleeping when people show up.

I'd imagine OP should care.  they're breaking their lease early and if the landlord gets it rented for the day after OP moves out then OP owes no additional rent and is done.  If it takes the landlord 30 days to rent it out then OP owes a month of rent.  OP needs to decide if 1 month's rent is worth keeping the place spic and span for the next 30 days.  Only OP can really make that decision.

So no my lease is not being broken early at all.

However, I am curious if you've explained your situation to the property owner. You're not going to be any worse off regardless so I think it's absolutely worth it.  I ran in to a similar issue with a rental a few years back. At the time I was working a 12hr overnight schedule, the last thing I wanted to deal with was being woken up by short notice viewings. I explained my work situation to the rental agency and they were very understanding. We came to an agreement that worked for everyone - essentially she made absolutely sure I would be notified 24hrs before any viewings. It was as simple as that. Good luck!"

Truthfully it would be in his best interest to listen to me since I may come in contact with future tenants.   I'm pretty sure my lease says 24 hours but I told her I would prefer just a few hours and for someone to be at home. I also wanted to block some days (like days we are gone) so random strangers aren't in my home.   However, she's insisting that I'm being unreasonable and 1 hour is all she will provide - some days maybe more time, some days maybe less time. She also doesn't want us home at all while its being shown. However, she's not showing it anybody can call and get the lockbox code. She also wants me to field all the phone calls for anyone wanting to see it and if they show and we're still there or the key is not in the lockbox (the key she wants me to go get made and pay for) they will charge us $25.   Hopefully my landlord comes through on my side but It's his pocketbook so doubtful.

It is also COMPLETELY unreasonable for the property management person to want you to get a key made, field calls, or pay her $25 if you don't do her wishes. The answer to these requests is ""no"" (unless your lease somehow says that you must do all these things).  My suggestion is to talk to her and try and work it out. Try and find a middle ground. A tenant/landlord relationship is almost always inherently stressful and a lot of times people just get pissed off at each other and double down instead of trying to negotiate a way to end the situation. It can be done.  Good luck!"
RealEstate,3bz0oz,fml,4,Fri Jul 3 12:13:28 2015 UTC,That's one of my main issues I don't want it being shown while we are gone. The property manager is not showing it. Anybody can call her and get the lockbox code and go and see the property. It is suppose to be for real estate brokers to show it but it will also be listed on multiple sites and if a person not working with a broker wants to see it they can without any realtor present (and the property manager won't show it period).
RealEstate,3bz0oz,fml,5,Fri Jul 3 12:48:37 2015 UTC,That's messed up. I have never heard of unaccompanied showings before. Are you 100% sure that's the plan? Around here (MA) there may be a key box but the agent is always present when the unit is shown.  Maybe someone here who knows the laws in TX can comment on the legality of this situation?

But I can say out of any place we've lived at in both Oklahoma and Texas this was only my 2nd house that I saw with anybody. Most of the time you go to the real estate office they make a copy of your id and give you a key to go see it; but they were always empty. I've never seen a house that someone lived in.   In the area I currently live in most people use a realtor/broker to find a rental place. That realtor then shows them any house/apartment they want to see. So the showing  will be accompanied  by a realtor 90% of the time but I could have 5 showings in one day and they all be 5 different realtors. But also if someone wants to see it without a realtor she will allow them and she won't accompany them she'll just ask them a few questions on the phone.

They have always understood my sleeping schedule and do their best to work with me.   However they are not dealing with renting the house out a 3rd party is. My landlord probably won't see the emails until Monday and hopefully he will tell her that I need notice or agree to my time frame with no notice needed. But until I hear from him I'm at her mercy I suppose.

So it's really your choice.  I am a little disturbed by your notice requirements. Do you have a lease running through the end of August? When did you give notice? 30 days is normally sufficient, so on July 1st giving notice of moving out August 1st is common and expected."
RealEstate,3bz0oz,kaeroku,3,Fri Jul 3 09:42:58 2015 UTC,"My lease requires a 60 day notice - which I knew. However, what I didn't realize was that my lease stated that  60 days notice is required but it has to be at the end of a month (I don't remember the exact verbiage).  I gave notice mid June so since 60 days is mid August I'm responsible up until the end of August. According to the lease if my notice ended August 1st I would still be responsible for the entire month of August as well. It's kinda jacked in my opinion and something I didn't realize was even there.   I don't care about people seeing the house I'm just not comfortable that random people can walk into my house at a moments notice and I'm suppose to be gone before they arrive. I work over night I have to sleep during the day and my kids are home all day. I also have to make the house available until late at night.   I also just don't feel comfortable that they want us gone for strangers to walk through our house. The property manager is not showing the house. Anybody can call her (or me because she wants me to field all the phone calls) and say I want to look at the house and she will give the lockbox code to them. Normally it will just be realtors calling and getting the code but she doesn't personally know them and has no way to prove over the phone they are a realtor.

Okay, Texas allows you to give notice mid month, so that would only be circumvented if your lease specifically says it has to be the 1st. It sounds like yours does but read it carefully.   You can still refuse to show it until you are out. If you're paying rent through Aug 31st, you don't have to give them a key before Aug 31st. Obviously you want to do it when you move out but it does not have to be shown before that. They may be rushing to try to save you money, but the choice is yours.  You are not being unreasonable at all. Your landlord is being incredibly unreasonable. Requiring 60 days notice, AND requiring you pay all of August, means essentially you are giving 75 days notice. You could probably win in court, although it would really be more a statement of principle than anything else. But don't feel bad about setting your boundaries regarding the showing. It can wait until you've moved out if that's better for you."

So what it comes down to is you: what is more important to you? Would you rather not be responsible for that 2-4 weeks of rent? Or would you rather not deal with 1-hour notice?  I'm sure you can have it either way. You can either make it easier on the property manager to show the place on short-notice (which may not work for you, and if not, that's fine) or you can deal with the chance that they may not be able to rent the place out if it's not available to show immediately... in which case you're paying the full amount you're responsible for.  Either way it's on you. There's a benefit to each choice (less money or less time committed to coordinating with other people's schedules.)  They're offering you an alternative to paying the full amount. The short notice is really a convenience item. If you do not wish to accommodate that, there's nothing wrong with making that choice. Just understand that it may result in the place not being shown as much, which may result in nobody being found in time to cover the costs you do not want to pay."
RealEstate,3bz0oz,Radiobamboo,1 point,Fri Jul 3 15:06:58 2015 UTC,"I've never told the landlord that I'm not willing to pay for August. I specifically told him I would pay on the 1st like always and we already have it budgeted. And I highly suspect it won't be rented out by the end of August anyways. It's  always been a little high and was empty for 4 months before we moved in but they are raising the rent again. It's a great neighborhood and school district but there are other feasible options around as well. I'm pretty sure they want it on the market now because they know it will take awhile to rent out (the house next door has been empty for 2 years now).  I'm only asking for more notice just to make sure I'm awake. I don't sleep at night everyday I sleep from 9am until about 3-4pm on days that I worked the night before and I nap most of the week as I don't sleep very well at night. It would really suck if I'm laying in bed (and obviously I would not be fully dressed) and someone randomly walked in my home and open my door waking me up. I also would want notice to let the kids know that someone may be coming over so there dressed and not freaked out and scream when it happens. People can call and give me a 1 hour notice but my phone will be on silent so I won't hear it. I also don't leave my phone off of silent because I get multiple calls, texts, messages etc during the day it would keep me up all day and I need sleep."

As I stated there, there's absolutely no reason to cave to these demands if the tenant doesn't care about getting out of the rent they are responsible for under contract."

That means everyday for those 9 days I have to sleep during the day period there is no other option.   I don't understand why she is saying she could maybe work around my schedule but refuses to just give me a few hour notice. I also suggested 3-6pm Monday - Friday with no notice and weekends needing an appt scheduled. She didn't like this suggestion either.  I feel like I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm not asking for 24 hours notice I'm just asking for a few hours (5 would be nice) and making sure I could be present for the showing.

The big concern for me is that one has to set up a proxy bid.  The last foreclosure I went to, the bank rep told me told me what the minimum bid was going to be.  This won't happen now, and I may never know if I could have received the property.  As an example.  The last condo I purchased our of foreclosure I was prepared to bid up to 55k, because that is the money I had.  I had purchased a different condo (same complex) for that price so I knew it was a going rate.  When I spoke to the bank rep he told me the bank was minimum was 60k.  With this new auction format, I would have been out.  The bank would have won the auction at 55k, (costing them stamp taxes) and I would have been out.  As it turns out, since I was there with the person that was financing the last 10k of my bid, I was able to ask him for the the other 5k I needed to make the purchase at 60k.    Perhaps this is what the counties want so that they can earn more stamp taxes from the banks, as they have to start bidding up to their minimums and not just purchase them for $100."

RealEstate,3byihc,fairly_quiet,8,Fri Jul 3 06:02:37 2015 UTC,"OP, I would not assume that you would have gotten that home but for your agent's advice. We have no idea what happened, but let me toss two hypothetical scenarios at you.  Hypothetical scenario:   Seller accepted offer for $760k to purchase that home. Inspections revealed $40k in foundation damage. Buyer and seller negotiated price down to $725k.   Hypothetical scenario II:   Seller accepted offer for $730k to purchase that home. Inspections revealed $40k in foundation damage. You, the buyer, want to negotiate the price down to $695k. Seller does the math and realizes that $695k will not be sufficient to pay off his expenses and debts associated with this property. At this price point, he is underwater on his mortgage after closing costs. Seller also realizes that this foundation damage must be disclosed to any future buyer, meaning that a realistic listing price now might just be $685k. Seller backs down, decides not to sell property at all.   Either way, no matter what your agent did or didn't do, Fate does not have it in the cards that you end up with that home. I have absolutely no evidence that this is what happened, but we also don't have any reason to specifically believe that something like this did NOT happen. Insufficient information to know."
RealEstate,3byihc,aardy,2,Fri Jul 3 18:39:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually make an offer based on his recommendation of what a realistic offer would be. I have signed an exclusivity agreement, so it's fire him or keep him."

Remember they're there to provide advice but ultimately you're the one who makes the decision on what and how to make the offer.  I kept track of some of the properties that we discussed...some he was closer some I was. We ended up closing on my current place for $260k below asking based on his advice. (in LA area)"

RealEstate,3byihc,nofishies,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:27:37 2015 UTC,I'd assume they negotiated down  for a MAJOR undisclosed thing (that still happens believe it or not) or you were quoted the non cash price and that was an all cash offer or had some other very attractive terms. ( either quick close or long term seller leaseback stuff like that)  If you are otherwise happy with the agents speed and communication I would not worry.  It is crazy brutal out there now.

Caller 2 says ""I will give you 950 for your couch, but I don't have the 950 yet.  My mom will probably loan it to me though.  She will want to come by at some point to look at it too to make sure she likes it as well.  I can give you a deposit now, and if it all goes well I should be able to pick it up sometime next month and give you the rest.

RealEstate,3byihc,nmanjee,4,Fri Jul 3 13:29:48 2015 UTC,"yes, and it adds a lot of time to the closing + it can fall apart over an appraisal too now.  You also are probably eating like 4500 a month in that situation on holding costs for that property, so losing marketing time costs you real money.  Not to mention depending on area, you can have seasonal concerns.  Say you live some place that gets a ton of snow, its september now, if their deal falls through you are looking at going back to the market when all activity dies.    shrugs whether its worth 25k just depends on your perspective.

RealEstate,3byihc,bmisko,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:22:42 2015 UTC,Huge undisclosed things still trigger negotiation. Most sellers just get everything done before hand. But if you really found 40k of unexpected foundation work people are starting to walk. Even if there are no contingencies.  Things are taking a whole 10 days now and maybe only 5 instead of 15 offers unless you are in biking distance of a specific office or certain school district/city combos.

RealEstate,3byihc,jorpjomp,2,Fri Jul 3 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"No, perhaps they originally had an offer at 750k that got accepted and then inspection/appraisal issues came up or whatever and the price had to be negotiated back down. Or, of course maybe there was some sketchiness to the sellers agent. Who knows?  A common problem I see is buyers not putting in offers frequently enough. If you like a home, figure out the price you want to pay, and PUT IN AN OFFER! It doesn't hurt! Just because you put in an offer does not mean you are tied to that property. With certain restrictions, you can still back out of it if you decide otherwise or a better home comes up."

If you believed that $730k was a fair offer you should've told him to make that the offer price. It's ultimately your decision. He needs to prepare CMA (comparative market analysis) reports for you to aid in your offer prices.   I was looking at an investment property last week, asking price is $250k, this place needs work and after doing my own CMA, the place is worth no more than $195K. When I told my agent she balked and said the seller won't take anything less than $230k, but after she pulled some sold comps, $195k was a totally reasonable offer. So I just put in an offer for $190k."

If you want to make an offer on a property make an offer. Even if it is a secondary or back up. You never know what will happen. Your agent only told you what he heard. The fact that he has so many positive yelp reviews probably speaks to how well connected he is in your market.

He is making around $18K in revenue for his firm/company, and regardless of whether the listing agent bluffs/lies... you need to submit offers which are very reasonable. Price isn't the only factor and all the dynamics in play would drive me to submit the offer and see where it goes. Good luck"

Realtor risked his pay and gave them vital information. Client went with a family friend realtor, used the guys information, and helped their friend realtor get a commission check. The friend realtor benefited from work they did not do. If the first guy insisted on an exclusive buyers agreement before he gave away that information, he would have been compensated for his work and knowledge.   In my experience, the ones that make sure you sign a buyers agreement before anything are the ones that make sure they do their job. But, that is coming from my limited perspective."

Everything was fine and they were set to close on Thursday. They were getting married on Saturday and much of their family was flying in from overseas with plans on staying at their new home.   I got a call on Wednesday, the day before closing, from the other agent. We were not closing on time. The seller filed for bankruptsy the week before and the house was now tied up in that mess.   I was quite upset that the seller could be so careless and throw a huge wrench in my buyers' already hectic plans. I started yelling at the other agent and said some pretty mean things.   I called my buyer and explained to him the situation just waiting for him to let me have it. He waits a few long seconds and says, ""I guess it wasn't meant to be. We will find another one.""   I felt like a total ass. I had completely overreacted and was completly unprofessional. I called the other agent up and apologized.   It was that day that I learned that things will always come up.

You would be throwing your money away.  There is often no rhyme or reason to the way some banks handle short sales, especially if they (or the listing agent) is inexperienced with them. My fist question would be, what do the comps say the home is worth? But even that is moot if the bank has no attachment to reason, reason being, market value.

The seller has a very experienced short sale coordinator, and we thought long and hard before putting in an offer on the short sale- knowing how long it might take for nothing.  Comps are in the $270-280 range, but the house needs A LOT of work ($30k before it's even move-in ready, plus some big expenses in the next 10 years) that we're prepared to do.

RealEstate,3bvkrh,DCCWA,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:37:12 2015 UTC,PMI covers actual losses realized and is fairly complex. Note holder isn't receiving a windfall.  Whether the note in this example is even covered by PMI is another question. I doubt that is the real issue OP is facing. What is making this transaction difficult is that there are 2 different notes on the property which makes the negotiations much more complex as there is yet another party involved that wants to get paid. The 2 note holders have to negotiate who takes the loss and in what proportions.
RealEstate,3bvkrh,ShortWoman,2,Fri Jul 3 15:50:58 2015 UTC,"In all my research and preparations for this short sale, this never crossed my mind.  It does sound sneaky, but the seller and agent are VERY cooperative and I bet I can find out whether PMI might be a factor."
RealEstate,3bvkrh,kvrdave,12,Fri Jul 3 11:07:40 2015 UTC,"Here's what they are ""thinking."" They don't want to lose money and they think they can squeeze somebody to get it. It's also possible that they are working from an appraisal or BPO (Broker's Price Opinion) from 6 months ago reflecting a higher value than is really there.  The only thing that makes sense for you to do is walk away. Keep an eye on the MLS since it is possible this property will pop up as an REO after the foreclosure is completed.  Good luck."

It was no longer their property and they were still trying to negotiate for more.  Lenders with short sales are so unpredictable that I don't sell or list them anymore.  They can back out at any time, renegotiate at any time, etc.  They hold all the cards.  Their specific addenda give them this power.  You need to remember that you aren't dealing with a motivated buyer who wants to sell so they can go do something else.  You are dealing with a person making $15/hour or so, who follows a script and their own whim.  And whether or not the place sells, they still go home at night having done their job.

Another issue is if the bank thinks they can get paid in full through a deficiency from the borrower, they are unlikely to take any short sale offer. From your post It's sounding like they want to be paid in full or very close to it. I wouldn't bother with the appraisal based on your post, the bank doesn't care about the value of the property, only the amount they get paid and what they need to do to maximize return. An appraisal isn't likely to change their minds.   Notwithstanding the above, banks are run by people, and yes, sometimes those people make dumb decisions.

We had a seller-accepted offer on a short sale for a house we LOVED.  They didn't counter our offer, and foreclosed instead.    We were willing to pay more than our offer, so we went to the sheriff's sale (again, totally inexperienced and didn't really know what we were doing) but didn't realize that the bank has an amount they say they'll bid up to at the beginning (that you don't find out until you're there physically at the sheriff's sale, I think?).  That amount was higher than we were willing to bid and above the asking price for the house.  So we didn't bid.  Eventually it came back on the market months later as an REO property (while we were traveling and couldn't act), though it seemed like they'd taken half the house apart in their ""clean-up"".  It was listed and sold for an amount we were absolutely willing to pay (significantly less than their ""min price"" at the sheriff's sale), had we been able to act in time.  It surprised us almost that someone else was willing to pay that, since it had sat on the market so long, but I guess people really hate bidding on short sales.  All in all I regret not just bidding higher when it was a damn short sale.  We made the mistake of getting emotionally attached, and it sounds like you have, too.  Been regretting it ever since."

I'll be at the auction if it gets to that point... but apparently the primary leinholder says they'll postpone the sale if we haven't come to an agreement by then.  Crazy how this all works. There is definitely some emotional attachment- but we're also in a region where there's not much to move on to, and we're currently living with family (ugh), so having money and time (60 days so far) invested in this short sale make it hard to move on. The seller's agent claims a 98% success rate on short sale listings, so we're optimistic.  I think that the success comes from screening out the bad candidates or difficult short sales.

Sometimes, the owners will get a short sale price ""pre-approved"" from the bank - but in this case it seems they did not.   There is very little ""logic"" to be found in how banks handle these situations - the only thing I can think of is that the ""short sale"" stuff is handled by one department, and the ""disposal of a foreclosed home"" is done by another department. The first department likely has different profit/loss parameters than the second one - so, even though the house will eventually sell for many thousands less than the short sale value, the first department isn't allowed to take that loss. *shrug*"

You don't have unqualified buyers, that are unknowledgeable on how the process works. Typically banks will try to discount the agents commission. But that doesn't go anywhere if you have a good agent that uses a buyer broker contract.  The property is already the banks possession, Once the property is defaulted on the bank owns it. They are letting the previous owner live in the property because its cheaper than letting tens of thousands of homes sit empty, left to be vandalized, deteriorate etc.  (they already tired that approach)  Banks don't use Local agents to list after they foreclose, they have agents that are on salary that do nothing but work for the banks.

IMHO, I would rather have a good tenant who pays a little below market. The highest bidder does not alway make the best tenant."

Our rent has gone up $20 per week in the last 7 years and the landlords could fill the house even if they put it up $80 per week so we're paying well below market rates. But, they're happy with what they're getting and we're only the third tenants in the 14 years they've owned the house.   We do a lot of repairs ourselves so as not to bother them with small things, I've done huge work in the garden, my husband is an electrician so he has upgraded a lot of light fixtures with LEDs that have been leftover from big jobs.  So as you say, I can be totally worth asking below market rates and having tenants in long term."

You deal with bullshit all day and keep your fingers crossed that you will actually see the rent check and that your rentals are not going to be vandalized.  As you move up in rent prices, things become very stress free - and yields plummet.    Exceptions don't make the rule.  Even if you see yourself as an amazing judge of character, it can be very hard to tell who is a good renter and who is a bad renter.  In fact, the worst renters - the scammers - are really, really good at fooling landlords.  This recently happened to my friend.  He never even got a 2nd rent check.  The woman moved in and basically refused to pay any more rent and used various tactics to drag things on for ~6 months.  But when he interviewed her and did various checks, she looked like a great - albeit poor - candidate."

Be aware that if you're slightly below market value and have tons of applicants, you can pick the best ones (strongest credit, income, rental history). I personally wouldn't rent it as high as possible, the dynamic will create a very entitled tenant. If, on the other hand, there's tons of competition and a tenant wins out, they will be very grateful. I've had tenants fix microwaves, do extra yard work and just generally be easier to work with due to this dynamic. An easier tenant is worth much more to me since I manage my properties myself.

I read all of your replies and realized that it wouldn't be right to increase the rent after advertising at one rate. Our last tenants were paying a little less than market rate, and I would have loved for them to stay seeing as they were great tenants. It was a knee-jerk thought when I saw how much interest there was, but thanks to everything you guys pointed out, probably wouldn't be a good idea to actually do.  Thanks!"

RealEstate,3bwa9n,snkscore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:34:02 2015 UTC,"I would tell everyone that there are multiple tenants who are well qualified and you'd like to ask for their best offer on rent and lease terms by a predetermined date and time.    Understand that you may upset some people who may withdraw their lease request.  It also works better if you tell them what you're looking for (longer lease term, more money up front, more rent, etc).   Personally, I'd rather have a good tenant who seems like a calm, low key person who pays a rent that I decided I was happy with than a tenant who feels like they got screwed a little on the way in.  Just my opinion though."
RealEstate,3bwa9n,NeedAChainsaw,2,Thu Jul 2 20:16:57 2015 UTC,"This exactly. If op raises the rent and one of the previous applicants accepts it, they will feel more entitled and might very well run the landlord ragged with constant requests and complaints. I would keep the rent what it is (market rent), and now I have my picking from this big pool of people. Pick the best applicant and run with it."

RealEstate,3bwa9n,YouWillRememberMe,0,Thu Jul 2 21:34:48 2015 UTC,"Well if you are worrying about having a bad tenant because of this, which personally I wouldn't worry about, you could take it off the market, return any application fees to people who applied, and then relist for 15 percent more.   You can't get into a long term situation renting a place for 15% below market value, and your tenant IS much more likely to be pissed if you raise rent 15% after 1 year rather than at the start of the lease."
RealEstate,3bwa9n,snkscore,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:58:35 2015 UTC,"If you haven't agreed to anything with a tenant you can do whatever you want. It's totally reasonable to pull the advertisement and relist. The general way this works is to go to the prospective tenants and tell them you have multiple offers so you need a best and final offer to sign a lease.  If you've promised it to someone already at the listed price, then yes, it's unethical to back out."
RealEstate,3bwa9n,fml,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:50:02 2015 UTC,"Better strategy, get applications, fund the top 5 then reply to them saying another tenant offers to pay more. Would they be willing to match.  Something like this is tricky, but a more reasonable approach."
RealEstate,3bwa9n,snkscore,0,Fri Jul 3 15:53:58 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why people think it's sketchy to do this, but if he were selling the house, it would be standard practice to take above asking prices?  Alternatively, if I were a potential tenant who really wanted that place, I might be happy to pay above asking if it meant I could get it as opposed to just trying to ""compete"" against 5 equal offers with no real way to make my offer better than the competition.  Maybe it's across the street from my office or my best friend has an apartment in the same building or whatever.  If someone was willing to pay more than me for the apartment, I'd understand, but I'd feel kinda unfortunate if it just fell to chance because potential tenants couldn't make their best $$ offer."

RealEstate,3bxgb3,wamazing,3,Fri Jul 3 00:24:11 2015 UTC,"Option 1: They purchase for $159,000 and give you $39,000 down with a secured note against the property for the $120,000 balance at x%. You can set the terms for this note. Typically, in my market, seller financing has a balloon feature. That is your buyer has to refinance the property within a 2-3 year period and pay a lump sum of principle remaining at the end of that period. But you could also set it up to pay you installments with interest of x% over a 10, 15, 20 year period.  Option 2: They purchase for $159,000 and assume your mortgage (if your mortgagee allows it) of $39,000 at 3%, and take out a second mortgage for $xxx,xxx at x% and pay the balance in cash. In the US you can usually find a second mortgage lender willing to go up to 90% LTV. In that example, it would be a second mortgage for $104,100 and then pay $15,900 cash. You net walk-away in that scenario is $120,000."

They can easily jump from one house to the next regardless of your trees.  We've fixed the holes. They just chew new ones when a new group is looking for an attic to live in.  Cost is to close up the holes after 1-2 weeks of no more squirrels getting trapped in them (to see when you've gotten them all) and to disposal/resetting-the-trap (using lethal traps, live ones are more).

The A/C repair guy concurred.  That's good that this is the exception at least. I want at least 30 days of nothing disastrous striking this house!
RealEstate,3bvy8m,goosetavo2013,5,Thu Jul 2 19:20:05 2015 UTC,It definitely should get better. File with the city about the recent flooding and look into getting one of those devices that won't allow sewage to back flow into your house and possibly a sump pump.

This guy explains it easier/better than I could:   Essentially, at cold temps, everything in the system is a liquid.  Slugging is when the compressor is trying to compress a cold liquid into a liquid and it implodes.  It is the biggest reason AC units fail in the spring - people turn them on before it is warm enough, or it was cold the night before and warm during the day.  I tell people 65-70 degrees for 24 hours before turning on the system.    I also say ""It's too cold!  What would it tell us if it blew out cold air?""  And then explain that it could kill the system.  Rule number one on a home inspection - don't break anything!  Rule number two is to pay real close attention to number one..."

Get a large tub.  Fill it half way with water.  Your goal is to drown the squirrels.  This is why you only fill it half way, so they can't climb out.  Figure a large enough tub you can trap tons of squirrels, but they will start to stink after a while.  You will need to throw them out after a while.    Put a board across the tub.  In the center of the board you will connect the two ends with a wire or rope with a PVC pipe over the wire or rope.  Cover this with peanut butter.  Any rodent will climb up the tub (put something so they can get to the board) and will walk across the board to the peanut butter.  They will fall off the PVC pipe with the string running through it and will drown.  I've killed hundreds of rodents this way and you don't have to reset it after every kill.

But yeah, we spend about $500/mo in maintenance or towards larger projects like the roof. Right now, with my new wife and I just having moved into a place with several issues that we know of (not even counting the ones we don't...), we're budgeting closer to $1500 per month. We have a nice little lull coming up after spending about $15,000 to replace the electrical panels coming into the house, trim all the trees, and replace the hot water heater.   This is why I'm not personally a fan of low money down home programs. Not everyone should own a home. It takes a lot of work, a lot of DIY learning to keep a house solid and secure and vermin-free, and people who have just bought a house on a low down payment program don't usually have enough scratch to make up for the inevitable ""shit happens"" -- which in your case, OP, literally happened."

This is in the UK though, where things are brick-built and roofs tend to last 50+ years.    EDIT:   Oh, I have my septic tank pumped every 10 years or so, which costs about that. Last time was about four years ago. I don't class that as a repair though, just something which has to be done periodically."

RealEstate,3byjzz,MEDALLOKUYA,5,Fri Jul 3 05:22:45 2015 UTC,"Depends on many factors. No way to really answer such a broad question.   Price of houses in your target market. I know people doing 30k mobile homes and people doing million dollar luxury homes. Million dollar houses are going to require a lot more capital than 30k mobiles Margins. There are many ways to skin the house flipping cat. I know people doing low margins and high volume and people doing low volume and high margins. Anything from 2 houses a year to 50+. And everything in between. And all sorts of different strategies. Cash or Hard money? Cash is nice, but I know people in this business with very little of their own cash that finance nearly everything with hard money. That is very expensive, but if you're buying right and moving fast it works. You could theoretically get into this game with basically no cash at all. ""Flipping"" houses for whatever reason is very sexy and attractive in theory to many people. I can't even begin to tell you how many people I've seen wash out of this game. It's like poker and watching the ""fish"" get destroyed. I was at auction last week and there was a house up that was right in my wheelhouse. Bread and butter for me. But it looked really nice from the exterior, much better and larger than it actually was. Anyways it got tons of action at the auction, including this one new girl who I had never seen before bidding it up hard. House gets bid sky high, into retail territory. We all assume it is a end user buyer, someone planning on living in it. That is the only way the purchase price makes sense. I go over afterwards and ask her what's up. ""Oh we're going to flip it"". Subsequently I find out that this is another guy's client buying her first flip....that is going to be ugly come sell time."

The hard money lender will only ever fund 70% of before repair value and 100% of the repair... in case they have to foreclose because we fuck up, they want some equity. So depending on the price of the house, I will have to fund 30-50k."

I manage an inspection company where its not at all uncommon for us to have a $800 ticket inspection.   In all honesty though, that includes termite inspection items, and radon testing. Everything is priced separately in most companies. Mold testing, lead testing, window seal testing, ect.  if you got all of these on a decent sized house it would be well over 1k.   The trick is finding a guy with a lot of experience and who is going to go through it thoroughly. Ask local realtors who they have used for a long time and why.   ps. also check the inspectors website, oh, if your in the grand rapids Michigan area you can use our company lol.

I told my realtor that I wanted to know as much about the condition of the house I'm buying as I could. I also asked family and friends who have bought houses in the last few years who they used and how satisfied they were.  The same name popped up a lot, and he has a reputation of being very thorough and fairly priced. I was there with him for a little over 3 hours as we crawled through every inch of that house. He photographed and took notes of even the most minor faults, and in the end gave me a binder that had the full report including supporting pictures for each notation.  I got a small discount which I put towards a termite and ant inspection due to the amount of trees near the house. The whole thing ran me $300.  TL;DR - Ask friends, family, neighbors and your realtor. Make sure they understand that you want a thorough inspection, not just a rubber stamp approval."

It also doesn't hurt to call the inspector and interview him. I spoke with my inspector for a bit when I first called and was able to get a better feel for his work. I appreciated his emphasis on utilizing technology when possible and also his emphasis on only two one or two inspections a day. Apparently some guys in the area do 4-5 a day.  What cemented it for me was that no one in my agent's office knew of this particular inspector. It sounds backwards at first, but the more I thought about it, agents generally don't want someone scuttling deals. Recommended inspectors I looked up had rather middling reviews..."

RealEstate,3bwdqf,cochon1010,3,Thu Jul 2 18:21:24 2015 UTC,"Locally, the water can go either way.  It is lienable to the property, so it remains in the owner's name, but many landlords have a duplicate bill sent to the tenants and they are responsible for payment, either directly to the landlord or to the water company.    Trash is handled like all other services that the tenant uses (utilities, internet etc)-paid by the tenant  Lawn care is provided by the tenant and the landlord does not typically supply equipment or tools to do so."

Since even a cheap new mower can cost around $200, and most tenants do not have a mower, I sell them a used mower for $10 and let them know I will buy it back for $10 when they leave. I generally get the mowers from craigslist or on the side of the road on trash day and get them running well before selling to the tenants. If it breaks I may repair it for them or simply sell them another one for $10. I want it to be easy for them to keep the property looking decent."

Look to include the term, rent, location, security deposit, subleasing clause, property damages, termination, early renewal, holdover, lease expiration, insurance, right to entry, repairs, other fees, smoking/pets, occupancy limit and local state laws- the more you know the lower your risk.  Here's a list of questions we recommend tenants and landlords ask.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F3zjMFXgdkKVvdhVi6EmS__tKndEBslTmI_5OfRe3sI/edit?usp=sharing  Let me know if its missing anything you might find helpful!"
RealEstate,3bwdqf,charmed0215,2,Tue Jul 7 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"Working with an individual landlord I would want a list of contractors to contact in an emergency. Say your roof starts leaking (excessive leaking, more than you could capture in a normal bucket) or your basement floods at 2am, obviously call the landlord first but if they don't pick up and the issue requires immediate attention who can you call? (Side note: get renters insurance).   Pet policy should be straight forward in the lease.   Do a move in checklist & take pics, keep a copy for yourself and send a copy to your landlord (at least the list, you can let them know you have pics if they want them).   Subleasing/lease re-assignment, I'm sure if you've been around this sub long enough you have read enough stories about people wanting to break their leases because they got a new job or lost their job or they just feel like moving - cover all the options you want available to you. I know some landlords charge a fee to take you off the lease and add someone new, others prefer to make you keep the responsibility & deal with the subletter yourself.   If there is anything about the apartment you want changed from when you viewed it: were there still tenants in the house? Was it spotless? Do the floors need steam cleaned? Walls painted? Counters repaired? Do all the doors/windows open/close properly? Do the windows have screens? Don't assume anything will be fixed (even things you spoke to the LL about previously) and get it in writing if it is important to you.   I don't think it's crazy to ask for a push mower but I wouldn't be surprised if they don't want to provide one. Not sure if you live in an area with a wintery climate or not but a shovel and salt is something to think about as well. I believe the liability if someone slips/falls on ice would be on the property owner - not 100% sure on that - so it might be in their best interest to provide those items for you (again do some research).   Something the owners may not have thought about, locks, are you allowed to re-key the house? (I personally would for security purposes, and I would also give the LL a key). What happens if you lock yourself out - I've totally done this before and luckily my roommate was around but I did try calling my landlord a few times. My last apartment (was in a 12 unit building with property management) charged $50 if they have to come let you in.   I'm kind of just trying to think of random things I've seen in my leases/had issues with personally/read on this and the legal advice subreddit.   As far as excluding things - you are the one signing the lease agreement, every term in there can be changed with both parties agreement.  For example your landlord might have something like, after 1 year you may chose to sign a new lease or go month to month for $x more per month, x is negotiable and something I would probably recommend changing to suit your needs. I would definitely ask for a copy of the lease ahead of time so you can read each term and fully understand it. If you have questions about what anything means (and I know you said you've been renting for several years but 90% of people sign without understanding - even if they read it so please don't take this the wrong way, I am totally guilty of this until I started dating a lawyer haha) there are tenant help groups that should be able to answer your questions - or google it.   If the property goes into foreclosure or the landlord decides being a landlord is too difficult and they want to sell - what happens to your lease? There should be a term in the lease that covers the scenario and if not there may be an area specific law that covers the situation.   Edit: in my area it is common for the landlord to pay water/sewer fees and then bill the tenant in a SFH situation. The reason being that not paying the water bill the city can put a lien on the property (this is area specific and could possibly be the case for other utilities in your area). Usually the owner pays for trash pickup."

My husband and I are in a similar situation, except with far less income-we found a home last week, got our loan stuff in order, and are set to close on July 30th, which is way earlier than we had hoped. But, one thing to keep in mind-the municipality you are moving to may also have a ""pet limit"" of sorts without a foster or rescue license. We have 3 dogs, and were looking forward to rescuing another once we are settled in a house-until we found out that our county has a 4 pet maximum (any combination of 4 animals, as long as all 4 aren't dogs). Cats will obviously be much easier to ""sneak,"" since they are probably a lot less disruptive to neighbors than our dogs are :)   Also, if you do go with a fixer-upper, keep in mind that you will need a Streamline or Homestyle loan to do the repairs, or cash on hand to pay for it all, since you can't finance a loan for more than the house is worth.

You're talking about facilitating a home purchase without a significant down payment, trying to qualify with prospective income from jobs you don't have yet (you don't mention current income), all this from a different state.  Best case: you can find and close on a house in a different state within a month to move into, and you're paying MI for ever and ever.  Worst case: you spend ungodly amount of time trying to find some place to buy, maybe lose earnest money, and end up living in a hotel hoping to find some place to live.  Rent. At least for now. In terms of cats ... easier to find a place allowing cats than if you were involved in Pit Bull rescue. Maybe don't be 100% truthful. You have ""two cats"", not ""lots of sick cats"". Be prepared to pay a deposit. If landlord balks at two cats, offer a larger deposit.  Settle in, and then once you're in your new area, then you can start thinking ownership."

There is no legal opportunity to tour the property let alone get any kind of inspection /disclosures prior to the sale. Unless you really know what you are doing, you might accidentally buy a property with a bunch of other liens. You may end up having to figure out how to legally evict the former homeowner (you have to honor the lease of a current renter). There are good odds that any particular property won't actually auction as scheduled. California has a right of redemption.

I have a high risk tolerance, so I'd do it. I don't know about how much risk you can tolerate. I imagine you work close to LA, so the drive will be terrible if you did that."

Right now we are renting 2BR in North Redondo for $1525, which is pretty good deal.   We are looking for 2BR place, but unfortunately there is not many of those in this area. most of places are 3-4 BR and they go for $600k and up .

RealEstate,3bw1ja,rAlexanderAcosta,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"But if you are going to have 120k in about a year, that's a hell of a down-payment! You could get a loan with great terms with a down-payment like that, especially if both you and your wife have great credit.  If you purchase a home that is exactly 600,000, then you'll have be at 80 LTV (mortgage debt to market value), which means that you won't have to pay PMI or MMI, which is an extra payment at about 300-500.   Get yourself a Conventional loan. FHA's are easier to qualify for, but Conventional have better terms if you can qualify for them. The hardest part about qualifying for a Conventional is the required down payment (FHA only requires ~3.5%), but you have the down payment covered.   :D"

There was a million dollar home down the street from me that was selling for something in the 300-400's. It needed extreme repairs done and the foundation was questionable.   If you go that route, you will need a lot of patience to get a HUD home in a condition you want it in."
RealEstate,3bw1ja,rAlexanderAcosta,2,Sat Jul 4 17:49:00 2015 UTC,"I believe you are misinformed about HUD properties.   As you may know, HUD properties are foreclosures that had FHA loans. So they were never mansions in the first place, even accounting for the higher FHA loan limits in high cost areas. Further (at least when I left the business), the selling process began with an FHA appraisal, which became the basis of the price. In fact, the listing will include a property code indicating whether the property is eligible for new FHA financing, whether it will require an escrow holdback to qualify, or whether the property condition is such that it cannot be financed using FHA. The PCR, which is available for download, will tell a potential buyer more.  TLDR: Maybe the property was ""way below market value"" because ""It needed extreme repairs done and the foundation was questionable."""

RealEstate,3bweqm,inviteallthecats,2,Thu Jul 2 18:28:50 2015 UTC,"I'd go for #3. It's only a liability issue for the sellers if you don't have everything spelled out in writing, and if you don't have insurance that covers them. I would spend a couple hundred bucks for an attorney and see what it would take to make it legal and above board. Figure out how to insure it to make them happy.   The lender won't care that you've been living there. You'd basically be doing a rent-to-own with a defined sales price. MAKE SURE the sales price that is agreed upon is in the contract (if the market gets hotter in 6 months the seller might try to get a higher price from someone else). And make sure your max interest rate is in there, in case rates blow up and you decide you want to bail. This way you at least know what your costs will be.   I'd want a couple other ""outs"" too, I think, so as not to be strung along indefinitely. Like if this isn't a done deal at 6 months I (and only me) have an option to convert this deal to a straight out rental.   I would not go with another lender because, let's say they do pull this off and make a loan on something that isn't really kosher. The seller now has no reason to get the APNs split up and when you go to sell you'll be the one either selling for below market (because no one can get a loan on it) or doing the split yourself.   Good luck."
RealEstate,3bvcdv,CREproptax,4,Thu Jul 2 13:25:42 2015 UTC,"If you are acting outside the scope of your experience when your managing broker doesn't have the experience to oversee your actions, you are probably in violation of your states real estate statutes if you attempt to list & sell your parents home.   Some things to ponder: Does your broker carry E&O insurance & are you covered in selling that home? (Many standard policies do NOT cover an agent selling their own/immediate family member's home without an additional special insurance rider) Is your managing broker a member of the local Realtor's Assoc? Because if not, then he can't be a member of the local MLS, which means you can't put the home in the MLS, which means you'd actually have to hang your license with a broker who is & does.  Honestly, it's great that you want to help out your parents, but in a profession such as real estate where the highest level of success depends greatly on experience & being able to side-step landmines, you'd be doing your parents a disservice as their listing agent. You could best be of help by referring them to a seasoned, ethical agent & then giving your portion of the referral back to them (or sharing).

If so, I do think it will have an affect, not necessarily on value, but in potentially limiting your pool of buyers, and therefore increasing the amount of time it takes to sell.  One thing to consider-is this in a neighborhood where your likely buyer is a family with kids or a young couple starting out, or is it an neighborhood where a retired couple may be looking to downsize?  Your potential buyer pool will tell you how much of an affect this will have.  In my experience, I have had buyers with young kids pass on even looking at a house without a common area bathroom that has a tub.

A lot of people who put down a decent down payment can rent on day one and be fine.  I usually recommend looking into a refi before beginning a lease as well to see if you can get your monthly payment down, but seeing as how it's been less than a year for you, may not be worth it.  Property managers are great, but if you can talk a buddy of yours into helping you out with it when there are issues and you can get the tenant to sign up for auto pay or electronic payment online, rent will be consistent, and you may not need a full time PM who will charge about 10% per month."

In my case it's a condo that I bought in 2005 and still am upside down on. For me I didn't have the money to write a 30k check in order to give someone my house. I didn't want to short dale as my wife and I want to buy in a few years.  So I take a $200/month loss per month for now. As long as I keep my tenant I'll keep doing that. If I lose her I'll re-evaluate my situation and maybe look at selling If values rebound enough.

I think it might be nice to ""build"" some equity   If you're taking a loss, you're not building equity. Rental properties do not appreciate like homeowner homes, they tend to depreciate. Tenants do not take care of properties like homeowners do. Right now you, likely, have a home a homeowner would like to buy. When you go through a cycle or a few cycles of tenants, your market segment has narrowed and your value will decline. You might pay down your mortgage balance over 5 years, but you might also see any equity you have erode."

RealEstate,3brslc,NightPhoenix35,26,Wed Jul 1 17:02:33 2015 UTC,"Wife and I are college educated and ~15 years into our professions. We make a decent wage, have virtually no debt, paid off all our student loans and drive older cars, and have excellent credit.  We just barely bought our first home in SoCal. We tried to get into a home in 2004, but the market didn't make any sense; i.e., you could rent an equivalent property for less money than the cost of ownership (interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance). 1 br condo in Long Beach were selling at >$400k, when you can rent a similar place for $1100/mo.   Prices are high today, but equivalent rentals are on par with ownership costs. Ideally, ownership costs should be lower than rent, and that is one of the benefits of owning... fixing housing costs compared to rising rents.   We tried for years to get out of state, but job market in housing affordable areas are not as employer rich nor abundant as CA and salaries are lower. Add proximity to extended families into the mix and we just couldn't cut ties with CA.   Bottom line is that houses are generally expensive in CA and the market is cyclical. It's not the best market for buyers right now, but it's achievable as long as you make a decent wage, not over leveraged with debt, and follow the conventional wisdoms of home buying (not price speculating) - buy within your means, buy in a semi-desirable area (lower crime, decent schools), and don't buy the best house on the block.  We've toyed with ""timing"" the market, but we are tired of watching our lives go by as we reluctantly sat on the housing market sidelines. We have a family, we need a home, and we want a home. We had to just bite the bullet since the market is ""affordable""."

Once you build equity, sell and put that towards a house purchase.  That's how things usually work for our generation. The old fuckers divided up cheap land for themselves and supported NIMBY laws that made prices rise even faster. So, you buy what you can and upgrade as your budget allows.  You can't expect prices to go down. The housing burst is something we won't see again for a while. Regulations won't allow that kind of leverage to happen easily.  California is a desirable, beautiful place. Everywhere that's desirable is pricey (and skyrocketing)."

It's glorified apartment living for nearly the same cost as an older SFR.

RealEstate,3brslc,agrobuddha,3,Wed Jul 1 21:18:51 2015 UTC,That depends on your HOA. Most HOA's only cover exterior repairs. They are also run by the most corrupt bunch of people living in your HOA. They regularly take bribes to hire sub-par contractors that do shoddy work so they work has to be repeated in a short time frame. There are 30k HOA's in California alone and many contractors build their business around milking the reserve fund of HOA's because of this closed unaudited system. Avoid it if possible.

Sure, on average home prices go up, but expecting appreciation is the same as prospecting, and is in no way reliable over the short term (or long term unless you stay on top of maintenance and updating.)  Also expecting appreciation to the tune of $200-400 per month is not reasonable. That's $2400-4800 per year, which - while entirely possible - is not something that every town-house owner can readily expect. *Edit: further, appreciation != income. You still have to access that money, which generally won't happen unless you sell. HELOC is an option, but you're still paying on that, usually with interest. So again, it's not free money.

RealEstate,3brslc,kaeroku,0,Thu Jul 2 00:00:55 2015 UTC,"NIMBY laws   NIMBY legislation doesn't make prices rise faster, it does prevent home values from going down in an area, which is a means of protecting an investment. Believe me, if you own land you do not want anything causing that property to decrease in value if you can avoid it. This is reasonable; owing significantly more than a home is worth (and being unable to afford payments) is a large part of why the housing crash occurred. NIMBY makes sense in terms of avoiding people losing - or being unable to afford - their own homes.  Since reddit loves links, here is a list of the kinds of things which NIMBY prevents. Are those unreasonable for homeowners to not wish to have near their homes? I think most people from any generation would agree they'd prefer to not have those things appear near a home they purchased after the fact. This is not unreasonable.  Moreover, since those industries do exist, and housing does exist near those industries in some areas, we see a variation in home values throughout an area. This is actually a good thing; it enables people to afford housing (of various quality) at different income levels. Again, there is nothing wrong with this.  It's easy to point fingers for why things are the way they are. Sometimes there are good reasons for why those decisions are made. Maybe more often than most people seem to think."
RealEstate,3brslc,jm1982,1 point,Wed Jul 1 23:32:08 2015 UTC,"Many NIMBY seem to be anti any development. Of course they will say they don't mind development, but just want to make sure it's the 'right' kind of development.  One example of development that can cause home values to rise a lot is higher density housing being allowed in an area.  If a house can be rezoned and condos or apartments or townhouses can be built on it , the land value alone can go up tremendously. Of course this would then require the original owner to move, but they could make a fortune. In L.A there are run down houses on multi family lots that are being sold as 'development opportunities' for huge money"
RealEstate,3brslc,kaeroku,0,Thu Jul 2 08:17:23 2015 UTC,"That's a reasonable counter-example. I do believe it is an edge case though; I'll admit that most of the time I've come across the concept of NIMBY it's been protesting legitimately unpleasant development such as shale mining, red-light-district type things, etc. The information available on the subject seems to support this.  So what I'm hearing is that in some cases people use the concept of ""NIMBY"" for not-really-NIMBY-style repurposing of an area's development, which sounds both unethical and not NIMBY at all, but something else. Maybe there's a name for that (aside from ""shady,"") but if so, I don't know what it is.  What I do know is, as a property owner I'd not be terribly happy if someone decided to drop a shopping mall on the lot next door to where I live, or a bar. (I used to live above a bar. Couldn't sleep.) Or any number of other things. And as a result of this, I can see NIMBY as a reasonable expectation; if I move somewhere I'm doing so for any number of reasons, but the surroundings are almost certainly one of those reasons. Minimizing the impact of change to those surroundings is a reasonable objective, and one which I can support property owners striving to protect.  Pointing the finger at ""NIMBY laws"" for some perceived sleight which, again, from all the sources I can find only offer a reasonable amount of protection for property owners, seems unreasonable. Further, rising property values cannot be solely attributed to NIMBY practices, even if it was 100% true that someone cited NIMBY in defense of legislation which lead to the (unethical) repurposing of development leading to rising home values.  This is because, absent any outside legislation, property values will rise over time as population density increases and/or other factors increase demand for housing in a given area. This is easily demonstrated by looking at historical home values in any growth area (and can be demonstrated via contrast, looking at any area which goes through decline and seeing how values fall.)  Given this, I maintain that it's unreasonable to point the finger at NIMBY in general as was done previously, though I will accept that there may very well be specific cases in which some unethical party has attempted to use that concept to further their own agenda."
RealEstate,3brslc,zorrov999,4,Thu Jul 2 08:32:22 2015 UTC,"Sharing our story here (knowing every person/situation/background is different). This is in the Bay Area  TL;DR: Don't wait too long.   Mid 2000's I debated for so long to buy a condo (what if I lose my job? what if I can't pay the mortgage, etc).. finally purchased a townhome in 2008 (high HOA - $450/mo -).  Back then we didn't have kids, so schools wasn't important (although I wish I had considered it. Real Estate in a good school district increases value faster).  5 years later we got a kid.. so now we need to look for a good school district.. luckily the house increased its value (+20%), so we recovered the down payment + 20% profit  We sold our place and rented for 4 months, while we look for a place we could afford.. We saw beautiful, fully renovated townhomes that were within our range, just to see them selling for $100K+ over asking  And finally we had our stroke of luck: We found a house (fixer upper) that, after escrow failed in the first offer, it was back on the market:   The listing wasn't removed from MLS, so, when it came back into the market, it was already like 50 days in the market (2 weeks listed + the time it was ""pending"" in escrow). In an area where houses are sold within 2 weeks, it was a ""red flag"" for many The address contains the number 4, which is really bad luck in Chinese culture. The house felt very very old.. Mostly cosmetic problems... but in an area where the median home price is $1.5M, people expects move-in ready houses   We competed against 3 other offers and we finally got our place, in our dream location with an excellent school district. Obviously we had to do some compromises (2 months remodeling before we move in, the smallest house surrounded by mansions, small bedrooms, 1 bathroom, etc), but we couldn't be happier. Our mortgage is way less than that we paid during those months renting.  If we would had been out that weekend (not paying attention to listings) we would had missed it (got re-listed on Friday, took offers on Wednesday)..   If we would had hesitated or not moved fast enough (reviewing disclosures, talking to contractors for the expected remodeling, etc) we would had missed it.  I have a friend that just purchased a single family home in San Francisco, 1600 sq ft house, 3beds 2 baths, for $770K.. Granted is not in the Mission (close to San Bruno), but is a beautiful house in an area that is expected to continue increasing its value   Good luck finding a house!"

The best way to afford housing and stay in California is look in a community / county where average prices are closer to within your price range, and commute to work. My parents did this for decades. I personally think it sucks, but it is how you could afford to stay in California on a lower income.  The alternative is to move elsewhere.

So you can decide to wait if you want however there are always good opportunities.  You need to look for deals in surrounding areas. Look for housing that might just have a sign or by owner. Driving around areas can help. Looking for torn down houses and fixer uppers Can be a good option. Buying already finished houses won't give you a good deal.  There are also developing neighborhoods to look into. For example parts of Oakland even Richmond which is getting better every year. Look at key markers like good housing price, the beginning of development etc. after you have enough to move up in housing you can rent the place out."

RealEstate,3brslc,ajfa,32,Wed Jul 1 17:13:54 2015 UTC,"Completely disagree. This is a much riskier proposition.  Buy the shittiest possible house in the nicest possible neighborhood you can afford. You can't force nice neighbors to move in, you can't force people to take care of their yards or their homes.   What you can do is upgrade your own house, remodel, re-do the yard, add-on, etc.   If even that is out of the realm of possibility, then it's time to take a hard look at renting versus buying. Where I live in the Bay Area a 3/2 with ~1300 sq feet on a 6000 sq foot lot will cost you a minimum of $600k in a good school district. Two years ago those same homes sold for $450k.   I rent the house I'm in for $2800/month because buying it would require a $120-$150k downpayment which I do not have, and I have kids so I want to live in a good school district.   I could afford to go buy a townhouse or something in a much worse neighborhood - worse schools, slightly more crime, etc - but to me it's not worth the trade-off. Especially as even a townhome is $500k in this part of town and HOAs are $300+ a month so the savings over a SFH isn't significant really, and I still don't have $100k to put down.   Even with FHA or 10/80/10 loans or something it's not really feasible in this area as my monthly payment would be massively unaffordable."
RealEstate,3brslc,jm1982,4,Wed Jul 1 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"I upvoted you because you're right: but there's a caveat.   In today's market it's almost impossible to get a good deal on the ""shittiest house in the nicest neighborhood"". Flippers with cash line up by the dozens, tear down walls and put in Viking appliances, and boom that house is $500/sq ft.   Not sure in CA, but in some of the nicer areas of SLC and Park City you can still get deals on homes that are huge but need work -- i.e. things that flippers don't have the cash or stomach for, but are still intrinsically good properties."
RealEstate,3brslc,ajfa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:06:16 2015 UTC,"True, I've noticed there are really no deals on fixers on the MLS.  I noticed a coupe houses that sold low near mine and the people that bought them are flipping them for quite a bit more. Both look like they were not bought on the MLS though, there was a sale but no previous MLS listing.   CA seems to be super competitive for flipping. In some other markets it's not as competitive.   You mentioned ""things that flippers don't have the cash or stomach for"" but I've found there are all types of flippers. There are some that only want to do minor cosmetic stuff and there are some that specialize in gut rehabs of properties , it all depends."
RealEstate,3brslc,Raidicus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:45:12 2015 UTC,"If the house is 6,000 sq ft, a gut rehab is pretty expensive (definitely by Utah standards -- though maybe not in CA?).   Most flippers I know go for small to midsize properties which need a new kitchen and living room, maybe take down a wall and put in a new beam, some new picture windows, Viking appliances and call it ""modern"". Otherwise, they'll bulldoze the property and build new. But there are still homes out there that are too nice to bulldoze but too big for minor renovation. There might be opportunities there if you're creative."

Good areas will always be good. ""Cheap"" areas will always risk volatility. The good deals ended about 2-3 years ago, when the foreclosures slowed down."

Median home price went from $700k to $500k and then back up to $700k again (actually closer to $800k) within that period.  What's really terrifying is not that those areas (Los Altos, Los Gatos, Palo Alto) were quicker to recover - but that they took less of a dip and then skyrocketed.  Palo Alto, for example, went from $1.3M in Feb 2007 to $1.2M in 2009 (~10% loss) and now in 2015 it's nearly $2.5M(!).   Untenable.

Of course this time it's a bit different than the .COM bust because pretty much all these companies are private rather than being on the public stock markets. It's mostly rich people invested in these companies that can afford to lose the money they invested.  But if the thing busts and rich people slow down on putting their money into startups..they could be some hurting going on.
RealEstate,3brslc,jm1982,2,Thu Jul 2 07:54:26 2015 UTC,"One thing that's different this time is that a lot of companies have engaged in aggressive stock buy-back; this (more than blue-chip status, number of users, or hotness at SXSW) could separate the wheat from the chaff. We'll see what happens when this tech bubble bursts. But I predict the usual: middle-class investors and their 401k's will take it in the shorts, the well-heeled will take a temporary loss and find other ways to replenish their coffers.   The good news is, for those in RE who can weather the storm, I don't see jobs becoming more stable or less temporary. This won't be restricted to dumpy ""rental neighborhoods"" either -- when professors and doctors earning $200k/yr don't know if they'll be in a metro area for another 3 years, it makes more sense for them to rent."

As rich people in other countries like China and the Middle East feel less easy about keeping their money in their home countries they are increasingly investing in real estate. The top choice for the Chinese is California.  For South Americas it's Miami.  All the global capital has made it harder for locals to afford housing too."
RealEstate,3brslc,SunshineAndGoldfish,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:57:21 2015 UTC,"It makes sense because a lot those cheaper areas were bought by people using subprime or ""liar loans"" etc .  Many of the people in the higher end areas that have been nice for a while bought their properties a long time ago and have them paid off or they had the resources to withstand the downturn if they were wealthier people that bought more recently. Most of these people likely didn't buy with FHA loans with low downpayments as the prices already exceeded FHA limits at the time of the crash.  Of course there were a lot of crazy no down loans at the time too though.  I agree the good deals ended 2-3 years ago. I bought in 2010, because I knew once the foreclosures (supply) went down prices would rise pretty sharply. That's exactly what happened ..and in L.A at least it's common to see that most of the people selling homes now bought them from 2009-2012 or so and are now trying to sell them for twice as much. Mostly looking in the San Fernando Valley area though since that's where my house is.  The area I live in has not really improved, yet people appear to be paying quite a bit more for homes now."
RealEstate,3brslc,jorpjomp,-1,Thu Jul 2 07:51:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with your concept 100% on buying ""the shittiest possible house"", but I would put a small qualifier on there.  I get what you mean, but someone else may take you literally. The shittiest possible house could have foundation problems, lead paint, asbestos, mold, etc. The shittiest house could be a complete money pit that the owner may never get out from under, have permitting issues that can never be resolved or could have other issues that future buyers would not overlook (meth house, murder, etc).  These homes are more in line with what a seasoned property investor would take on, not a typical home owner without the appropriate experience and cash reserves.  What one should be looking for is a house that is on the lower end of the better neighborhood. A house that, as you stated, one can upgrade, remodel, etc. One that, as you inferred, has potential to move up from the bottom of the neighborhood pricing to the middle to the top."

We looked at a house recently in the Bay Area that was in an ok neighborhood. Probably on the up and up. But, you walk in and it reeks of smoke. Like reeks to the point where my eyes are watering and I am listening to real estate agents telling their clients at the open house that they are going to have to rip all the carpet and drywall to get the smell and stains out. The kitchen was missing 1/2 of the cabinetry and the backyard concrete slab was broken to bits. I did not even bother to look and see what else was wrong with the house (after seeing the hoarder episode that was the garage). House sold for $775K, which was $5 OVER asking price for that 1000 sq ft house. Same size as my condo (which also, we bought during the recession 3 years ago and it is now worth double what we paid, we can't sell it and leapfrog into a bigger place because there is no guarantee that we are going to be able to sell it and be able to find something quick enough that is better than what we have now and not $1.7M to make it worth it)."

RealEstate,3brslc,ajfa,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:48:14 2015 UTC,"Everything is selling in less than 14 days right now (though, I agree that it is really heavy cash buyers right now-- we were looking at a closing of 14 days for our offer. We were hoping for 10, but the loan broker said 14 was as fast as they could go). People are dropping contingencies (even really big ones like appraisal and financing), we got outbid on a townhouse in that exact geographical area by $120K (and that was after putting in a bid $25K over asking ourselves that was higher than neighboring comps). Stuff is getting nuts (and we are a tech household making good money). I think we shall sit tight for now, since we already own our condo and just want to upgrade.

Going crazy on price isn't what gets you the house. No one looks at your offer if you have less than 40% of the purchase price in the bank right now. If you have that, then a good agent will use their social skills to make sure you get to make the final bid.  That's how we got our place without overpaying. Our agent presented last and squeezed the price out of the selling agent. We paid $80k less than the 2 other places that sold in our neighborhood, one of which closed a week before us. Great agent."

Identifying them and investing when prices are low is a great idea.   On the flip side, there are plenty of high-end areas where prices don't go down much, but they don't go up either, and you're stuck with a property sitting forever on the market just because no one can afford that area."

Before it was different and there were those undiscovered neighborhoods were one could buy a cheap or affordable house, but those days seem to be gone...because the 'bottom' is so high.  This can work well though in other cities.  I actually think it's a good idea for people that can't afford to buy a primary residence in CA to invest in these types of areas elsewhere.

I am in L.A and I read that something like 12% of homes are affordable to Middle Class buyers. Most likely a lot of them are in place like South Central L.A .   Not sure what part of CA you are in .  But I know in L.A homes in the more desirable areas didn't go down much. So one thing to think about is , is there a likelyhood of a 'bubble burst' that is much worse than the last one.  The last real estate crash was pretty much a one in a generation or even lifetime type of event.   Fortunes were lost, but many fortunes were also gained during that time.  There were many parts that went down a lot and have now recovered and are near where they were during the peak of the last boom or even surpassed it.  For an example in L.A , homes on the westside up until the late 90s -early 2000s could be bought around 300k, now they are typically around 1.2million or so.  Wages have not gone up nearly that much at all...and the late 90s was a booming time for the economy. People were making good money and there were lot's of jobs too.   One thing you might want to consider if you can't buy in your neighborhood/city is to invest elsewhere.   From my research, I've found that it's not true that the only markets that really appreciate are in L.A, SF or NYC.  If you study markets that are improving, it's possible to do quite well by investing in them. You might find that you could easily buy multiple properties elsewhere for what you would spend on one in CA. Over time you can use the cashflow and (hopefully) appreciation to help you afford something in CA.  You'll want to have a good team though and know the market well though which does take time."
RealEstate,3brslc,Plum12345,1 point,Thu Jul 2 07:32:48 2015 UTC,"No, there's no crystal ball. I think the answer is partly psychological. It can be so frustrating when you can't find a place, especially in a hot market. Here's how I would approach it:   Be happy with renting. People equate buying a house as a must, an ""American Dream."" It's really not. It's an investment, and if renting vs. owning doesn't work monetarily, then don't make that investment.  If you absolutely, positively need a SF home (with a yard) AND you can't rent one for cheaper or close to buying, then find a home that you can stay in for 10+ years and be aggressive with your bid. If you can afford the monthly payments but are reluctant because the offer is 50k more over asking, who cares. If you commit yourself to staying in the home long-term, the price becomes (somewhat) less important. If you're planning on finding a 5 year home, and then moving again, that's much riskier. While it's not ideal to have to do this, if you're in a position where you need to buy, you don't have much negotiating leverage and need to pull the trigger anyway."
RealEstate,3brslc,Cartra2014,0,Thu Jul 2 12:56:14 2015 UTC,"While I know that the California market is expensive, I wouldn't dare to think even for a second that renting is OK. Even with a mortgage on a house you're paying mostly interest for the first few years but it's not wasted; you're putting equity into your house.  I, instead would get creative and look for other ways to buy a house. I sure there's someone that will sell on contract, and that just enough to get your foot in the door."
RealEstate,3brslc,dcbrah,3,Thu Jul 2 13:31:44 2015 UTC,"I can understand your point, but I disagree. It's tough to compare without real numbers, but if you save $x per month while renting, you can put that money into another investment that may end up doing better than whatever principal you'd earn in real estate.   I own my house so I certainly understand the benefits, but if I could save a substantial amount per month renting, I would."
RealEstate,3bsi0d,Fuddit,14,Wed Jul 1 20:03:52 2015 UTC,"A survey is NOT a junk fee. In fact, a survey is pretty damn important! A surveyor will go out to the property and measure the metes and bounds of the property that you're actually buying. He'll draw a nice map of the property, showing the property line, the improvements on the property, any fences or shrubs, and any easements on record.   Now, 99% of the time, especially in a place like NYC (where I practice) there is no problem. However, in a very few cases, the survey may reveal issues. For instance, the fences may actually be off your property line. So you might have thought you were buying more property than you actually were. Or it'll show an easement from a city. (In one instance, there was a patch of land in the middle of the backyard that belong to the city. Client wanted to build a porch there. Wasn't going to happen.)  Surveys go from $400-$700. It depends on where the property is, how big it is, and competition."

RealEstate,3bsi0d,superjuan,3,Thu Jul 2 12:42:25 2015 UTC,"Two things to keep in mind:   There are essentially two types of surveys you can get for this purpose: a ""house location"" survey and a ""boundary"" survey. The boundary survey is more exact and they typically leave markers showing you where the boundary is. For lenders though, a ""house location"" survey is usually good enough. Like a few of the other ""required items"" (like title insurance, for example) you typically have the right to pick your provider. So feel free to shop around for a surveyor. They'll normally give you a quote over the phone... you'll just need the location and size of the property and ask them for the price of the ""house location"" survey.   As an example of pricing, in my area (Montgomery County, Maryland) a ""house location"" survey runs about $200-300 for properties less than half an acre. A ""boundary"" survey for the same size property runs at least $600."

RealEstate,3btnal,ShortWoman,3,Thu Jul 2 02:02:54 2015 UTC,When I looked at rentals not having a dishwasher was a deal breaker. In unit laundry was a luxury but in building laundry was on the minimum must have list.   If it has hook ups providing the appliances would be very beneficial. Buying/moving heavy appliances is a pain when you're renting. I had to provide my own washer and dryer in one place and it was in the basement so it was awful getting it in and out. Much more likely to cause damage moving big stuff like that too. I think if you're going for upscale that it would definitely be worth it. You can include a clause in your lease for repair if the issue is caused by negligence - IE someone putting plastic in the dryer and ruining it.
RealEstate,3btnal,slambur,3,Thu Jul 2 05:29:45 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine a place where not having a dishwasher wouldn't hurt you. You have granite countertops, hardwood floors, and are charging $1400 a month rent but a $300 appliance is too much to ask?  Not only would it hurt you financially but you will alienate the best renters (i.e. me and everyone I've ever known who rented) if you don't have a dishwasher in each unit."
RealEstate,3btnal,FlyingBasset,2,Thu Jul 2 13:12:57 2015 UTC,"Don't bother with common household items. People have their own stuff.  Dishwashers are definitely a perk for which you can get a better rent. In one of my buildings, we renovated every unit and put in dishwashers; we have the fewest repair calls on them.   In-unit washer and dryer is likewise a big plus--nobody like dragging stuff to the laundromat. Around here, tenants almost never supply their own appliances so I would provide them, but check your market for what's normal. Make a point of coming by at least annually to clean out the dryer vent.  We have supplied internet with mixed results. I'd only do it if you can get it in at cheaper than market rate--in larger properties, telcos sometimes will give a bulk rate--and then increase rent for the internet service so that it's somewhere between market rate and your price. This way, you make money and the tenant is saving money (over having bringing in the service themselves). But otherwise, I wouldn't bother. You don't want to have to be the tenant's ISP and have to deal with their internet problems."
RealEstate,3btnal,sonalogy,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:57:33 2015 UTC,"Look at competitors in your area - do they offer a dishwasher/in unit washer dryer? If I was renting, in unit washer/dryer would make a difference."

First time you have to pull and invert a toilet to get the folded Hefty paper towel out you will too. Cheap shower curtain is cheap and gets them through the first morning.  Granite countertops?  add the dishwashers. Remarkable to me how many single young people renting a cheap one bedroom inquire about the lack of a dishwasher. Upscale place the dishwasher will be de rigueur IMHO. Washer dryer I would leave out - let them fix their own and moving them will slow down apartment hopping.
RealEstate,3btnal,calmloki,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:34:42 2015 UTC,"I generally assume based on past experience that ""free"" internet has a high probability of being borderline unusable - it's a nice bonus but I wouldn't value it at $50-100 a month since I might have to get my own internet anyway.  Maybe that's different if it is a well-known high-speed provider.  I'm still not sure it makes sense unless you get a significant discount for hooking up your entire building since you'll have some people who just want the cheapest possible option and others will want the best possible internet.  The plunger seems like a smart move since it may save you maintenance calls :).   Washer and dryer is a nice bonus.  Having the hookups is already a plus but a lot of tenants still wouldn't want to deal with the hassle of buying them, moving them in, then moving them out at the end of the lease.  Dishwashers are nice but it depends on the tenants whether they will use them or not."

Materials (rollers, trays, tarp, etc.) could run another $50-100 depending on how fancy you get.   Professional painters could run you a couple grand but if you really don't want to do it yourself (and don't mind the hassle/usually less than superior work) you could hire a couple of people of Craigslist for $50 each and some pizza/beer.

RealEstate,3bs08l,NumNumLobster,6,Wed Jul 1 18:53:50 2015 UTC,"May I offer a different perspective? Whether it's paint or anything else, how you respond to this request will set a precedence in how you teach these tenants to treat you as a landlord.  If you say Yes to this request, you're telling them that they may request (and expect) things that were not agreed upon.   While I'm not saying to tell them no (because I do feel it's always a good thing to do between tenants, as it keeps your property in good shape & sets your expectations that you relay in terms of condition of the home), if you want to say yes, I would say yes on your terms. Meaning, I feel it's reasonable to agree, especially if this is in a nice area, however let them know that it's not scheduled for a few months/6 months down the road. That way, you can see how they pay rent/take care of the place & honor their request at the same time. Just my two cents here, but I feel that things of this nature are not so much about the actual request as they are how you're going to manage the relationship & the experience you'll have based on your decisions."

We have learned that allowing a tenant to paint is a bad idea. They never do a good job. I also emphasize on signing that the tenant accepts the unit in its present condition as indicated in the contract. It's best to set boundaries in the beginning. In most cases, I have more than one applicant and I always let the tenant know that there are/were other interested parties."

Shows them that you are reasonable and willing to work with them. If they wanted a full repaint they should have asked for it when you were negotiating before they signed the lease."
RealEstate,3bs08l,wordedgewise,8,Wed Jul 1 18:23:58 2015 UTC,Perhaps just offer them the paint
RealEstate,3bs08l,bjam2,3,Wed Jul 1 18:33:19 2015 UTC,We manage about 50 units in our own buildings. We almost always paint between tenants.
RealEstate,3bs08l,friendlyfire,4,Wed Jul 1 19:14:12 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda shocked as to the number of people on here who think painting an entire apartment and polishing all the floors is no big deal.  If you are paying someone to do it, it's basically an entire months rent.  If they wanted fresh paint and polished floors, they should have had that request prior to signing the lease, and the price of the rental should have reflected it."
RealEstate,3bs08l,bjam2,2,Wed Jul 1 22:28:50 2015 UTC,"If you use the same color paint, you should be able to get away with filling the holes and doing touch up painting.  The problem is if you're out of state."
RealEstate,3bs08l,California_Viking,2,Wed Jul 1 20:32:52 2015 UTC,Agreed. This 100% should have been agreed on before the lease was signed. I think giving in to this request is going to set a bad precedent.
RealEstate,3bs08l,catmanus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 12:50:53 2015 UTC,"Well, where I am the landlord is legally REQUIRED to paint the walls every three years.   So, yeah - it doesn't seem like that big of a request to me. Although it's usually done between tenants as it's easier that way."
RealEstate,3bs08l,PaulPocket,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:37:52 2015 UTC,Does no one have the term in their lease that the tenant accepts the unit in present condition?
RealEstate,3bs08l,Suppafly,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:25:47 2015 UTC,"You have a couple options and it depends. Here is some information that might help.  1) If they saw the place before they moved in and signed Off They really have no recourse. THey could give notice at the end but that's it. In my experience the majority of the time a tenant does this they end up being very demanding tenants who can cause headaches.   2) if you do get the floors repaired and the walls painted inform them that there will be disturbances. That you expect it to be returned the same. Make sure they agree and understand this.  3) I will be honest when a Tenat lives and asks these improvements to be made they might start to ask for more. They might tell you they need you to pay for a hotel while the work is being done. That they left something somewhere.  4) you hire good workers, get a couple bids. Make sure they know and agree to any possible disturbance and that even the best contractors can leave small messes etc.  If you're getting good rent and they're qualified tenants go ahead. You don't have to. If they have already asked for lower rent, needed you to be lenient due to bad references or credit score then I wouldn't. These tenants will just keep taking advantage of you."
RealEstate,3brwdo,Skippaj,24,Wed Jul 1 17:29:46 2015 UTC,"Here's how it would go down in Arizona w/ the AAR contract if I was your buyer's agent -your state may vary. Wildly.  I would be serving a cure notice to the Sellers for not having repairs done the 5 days before escrow that I specified in the contract &, if it's what you wanted, would tell them there's no way in hell you're signing until that repair is completed or the money paid towards your closing costs/escrowed for repairs. You do NOT fuck with my clients. You complete what you agreed to or you pay my client. I absolutely deplore people like this. Is it small? Yes. Do I care? Fuck no. You do as you agreed or pay my client to compensate. My client doesn't close until the terms of the contract have been fulfilled by all parties.  (now if you have movers scheduled this weekend & it's going to cost you more to reschedule, you have to weigh your options there, as sometimes it's not worth the hassle if you hold out, but only you get to decide that & I, as your pretend agent, would do whatever you wanted in this scenario.)"
RealEstate,3brwdo,ShinyLightning,9,Wed Jul 1 19:17:18 2015 UTC,You... I really like you.
RealEstate,3brwdo,jmizzle,3,Wed Jul 1 20:40:15 2015 UTC,"As the buyer I wouldn't be happy about being made to wait on closing. In my neck of the woods holding up closing isn't much of a threat, there's backup buyers lined up out the door on every transaction. It just punishes the wronged buyer as well to refuse to close. Is there an option where you force the sellers to close on the agreed-upon date and keep the $100 in escrow/returned to buyer and seller gets no say about how they want to handle it? That would be more satisfying."
RealEstate,3brwdo,junegloom,2,Wed Jul 1 23:54:23 2015 UTC,"If you can get all parties to agree on that and put it in writing, then yes. You can't force anything that's not in the contract.  Aside from that, once you close you lose your leverage, typically after that the only way to obtain any money from the other party is to go through the court system. Small claims or otherwise. You really need to consult your agent/lawyer on this one as your options will vary by state."
RealEstate,3brwdo,ShinyLightning,12,Thu Jul 2 00:01:05 2015 UTC,"A similar thing happened to me the night before closing. It turned into a bit of a mess, but the initial suggestion by my agent and attorney was to hold money in escrow for the repair.  Good luck and enjoy your new home! I just had my first night in mine on Saturday, and it was an amazing feeling! :-)"
RealEstate,3brwdo,spinel_sky,9,Wed Jul 1 17:51:10 2015 UTC,"Ask them to escrow the money for repairs, the escrow is released when the repairs are completed."
RealEstate,3brwdo,landofmisfits,15,Wed Jul 1 19:06:04 2015 UTC,"If it was agreed that it was to be fixed then they need to complete the repairs. There are other people who repair houses then the guy whos wife is in the hospital. As unfortunate as that is, that is not your problem.  If it was agreed to be repaired, then it needs to be completed. I'm so tired of everyone doubling back on their word or thinking they can get away with things because of this that or whatever.  I work in the REO Department of a Top Listing Agent in Florida. One of my duties is to suggest repairs, get bids, and get people out there to complete the work. Sometimes we have to make last minute calls and do whatever we can to save a closing. They should be doing the same thing.   Buying a house is a huge deal, you should make sure everything is how you want it and everything that is agreed upon is done correctly."
RealEstate,3brwdo,LisleSwanson,6,Wed Jul 1 17:52:20 2015 UTC,"Its a small thing (probably $100 bucks to repair).   There's your answer.   Chalk it up to the cost of experience and learn this is why you negotiate for repairs on a dollar/credit basis, not on a results basis.   (Also, they're willing to pay for it? How do you see it blowing up in that case?)"
RealEstate,3brwdo,PaulPocket,5,Wed Jul 1 20:05:43 2015 UTC,"Well, it really depends on what was stated on the contract.  If you said they needed to replace the rotted siding, and there is rot on the window that wasn't specified to be replaced, then there isn't much you can do.  If you said they had to repair all rotted wood, then you can certainly hold them to that.  However, if there is a cost to you associated with a delay in closing that exceeds the cost of repair, then it's probably not worth it.  Personally, when it comes to buying a house and dealing with repairs as part of the sale, I prefer to get estimates for the work and negotiate the cost of repairs into the contract.  This allows me to make sure the work gets done right.  The seller has little incentive to do the work right and will most likely choose the cheapest quickest way to get the work done.  Something you should be concerned about is what caused the wood around this window to rot.  The rotted wood is typically a symptom of poor water drainage of some sort.  Replacing the wood without fixing the source of the problem is only a temporary fix."
RealEstate,3brwdo,StellasBuddy,3,Wed Jul 1 21:18:09 2015 UTC,Escrow money for the repair. Problem solved.
RealEstate,3brwdo,moleculoso,4,Wed Jul 1 21:41:42 2015 UTC,"If I was your agent, and you felt this strongly about it, I'd try pushing the close back to tomorrow afternoon so they could repair it. If they didn't pull it off, I'd give you a $100 gift card to Home Depot and tell you to add it to your never-ending to-do list that comes with owning a home and congratulations!  Of course, I would've done the walk through 3 days before close so I would have some time to kick their asses into high gear because I have ZERO patience for agents who don't make their clients take care of their contractual obligations to a T. Just, grrrrr. Unless I know the agent,  or have receipts beforehand, I get in there early.  And if it's a Redfin agent, it's a safe assumption that they didn't do the repairs and I'm going to have to yell and threaten to delay closing so I ride their asses far in advance."
RealEstate,3brwdo,earthpeesfire,2,Wed Jul 1 21:46:37 2015 UTC,"What is a redfin agent, and what is the basis of your comment on them? Not trying to poke holes, I genuinely would like to know what your referring to. Thanks."
RealEstate,3brwdo,Electricalsushi,3,Thu Jul 2 16:52:44 2015 UTC,Redfin is a discount brokerage and they're consistently terrible in my area. Being across the table from them means having to manage both sides of the transaction and riding their asses to do their jobs. It's always miserable.
RealEstate,3brwdo,earthpeesfire,3,Thu Jul 2 17:20:57 2015 UTC,"Like many have said if it was agreed to that it must be repaired. But in order to save the deal, if you really want to, I would suggest you enter into an addendum. I am NOT a lawyer but in my experience I would word it in such a fashion where X amount of dollars would be escrowed from the sale of the property in order to remediate the repairs.  If they cannot agree to such terms then having a contractor estimate the repair work needed and take that dollar figure and remove it from the sale price.   I prefer the former instead of the latter because anything under $30,000 does it make a dent in what your mortgage would be, also your mortgage company would have to approve such things.  The final thing that you can do is cancel the contract because they broke Terms and walk away. Good luck."
RealEstate,3brwdo,kekehippo,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:54:08 2015 UTC,"two very soft spots in the siding and on the window is going to cost more than $100 anyway, and especially so if there is rotted structure you can't see which is why they didn't want to open up the area and fix it in the first place."
RealEstate,3brwdo,Suppafly,-6,Thu Jul 2 19:00:46 2015 UTC,"So you're going to postpone a 6 figure transaction for $100? I hope your agents, sellers, and lawyers don't read this. It's things like this which cause slow markets."
RealEstate,3brwdo,lilninjali,15,Wed Jul 1 18:55:11 2015 UTC,Wouldn't it be the person who didn't keep their word who is slowing the market?

RealEstate,3brwdo,NumNumLobster,-1,Thu Jul 2 00:55:54 2015 UTC,"Look, I know what you mean. But this $100 thing is trivial compared to the days and months of work sunk into coordination, paperwork, and timelines. Everyone is human. It's silly to get bent out of shape over a house purchase at the cost of a down comforter. Just saying."
RealEstate,3brwdo,lilninjali,0,Wed Jul 1 20:02:21 2015 UTC,"no, this is the inherent problem in qualitatively describing repair work in a sales contract."
RealEstate,3brwdo,PaulPocket,8,Wed Jul 1 20:06:49 2015 UTC,"Its more about protecting yourself as a buyer. What happens if they remove the siding and finds that underneath everything is rotted? Or theres termites that's causing structual damage? Not saying this is the case, but this is a 6 figure transaction like you said. You want to make sure you're getting what you've paid 6 figures for."
RealEstate,3brwdo,AZ_TCH,2,Wed Jul 1 20:19:48 2015 UTC,"this would actually be my primary concern.  If it was $100 guaranteed I'd just offer to take it off my commission in order to make everyone happy, including me because I wouldn't have to fuck with this.

RealEstate,3bt93g,chupa0,5,Wed Jul 1 23:27:06 2015 UTC,It is not a market arms-length transaction so should be disregarded for most comparison and appraisal purposes.

RealEstate,3btifz,SandS5000,3,Thu Jul 2 03:44:58 2015 UTC,"A new exterior door is very expensive, like over $1k for a cheap one installed from Home Depot. Call around and get some estimates so you know what to expect.   If you want to push it and sue him you need to give 7 days notice in some places. But, you may end up owing more in the end."
RealEstate,3btifz,wmurray003,0,Thu Jul 2 05:19:48 2015 UTC,...what kind of doors are you installing?
RealEstate,3btifz,minze,3,Mon Jul 6 00:36:15 2015 UTC,"We didn't see the point in telling him before we moved out as we still owned the dog and wouldn't want her to scratch up the new/repaired door.   That makes no sense.  Why do you think the landlord would repair the door when the cause of the damage to the door was still there?  If the dog was still there the landlord would have left it as is until the dog was gone (which was when you guys moved out).  Honestly all you did by not telling the landlord was cause him to potentially lose rent for 5-6 weeks.  There are potential tenants who won't believe a landlord when they say that the door ""will be fixed.""    What should have been done is you let the landlord know about the damage when you gave notice.  That way he could have ordered the new door and it would be delivered pretty close to the time you moved out.  As for the deposit, as mentioned elsewhere it is very state specific.  Some states allow the deposit to be kept longer if there are damages that take time to get repaired.  Some states don't allow this.  YMMV"
RealEstate,3btifz,minze,-1,Thu Jul 2 10:56:54 2015 UTC,"I don't see why he would be losing out on rent this whole time. The door is perfectly useable, it just looks a little ugly on the inside. it functions perfectly and the rest of the place is flawless. Plus he could have been showing the place or at least attempting to get it on the market after my move-out notification and he didn't. I also wasn't aware the door would have to be ordered."
RealEstate,3btifz,wamazing,5,Thu Jul 2 11:44:59 2015 UTC,"I don't see why he would be losing out on rent this whole time.  The door is perfectly useable, it just looks a little ugly on the inside. it functions perfectly and the rest of the place is flawless.   Because there are many landlords who say ""this will be fixed"" and don't ever do it.  Also, some people may be put off when seeing something like that.  From you're post I take it you are a handy person.  you can look at something and see the potential of what it looks like fixed.  Not everyone can do that.  Some people can't ""see"" what the finished item will look like until it is actually right there in front of them.  My mother is like that.  When helping her at her house I will explain to her what it will look like when completed and she just doesn't get it.  When I'm done I can see the light go on in her eyes with a ""oh, that's what you were describing"".  Thus, anyone who is like that won't ""see"" passed the shitty door.  That's why I say he is potentially losing rent.    Another thing is that who knows if he can get the same door.  If he gets a different looking (but completely functional door) and has tenants ready to move in they may night like it.  Now you have to deal with a tenant who is upset because ""what they rented"" isn't ""what they got"".  If you come at this from a business perspective I'm sure you can see why something like this is a problem.  The fact that the ""door is perfectly useable"" doesn't hold a lot of weight.  Hell, one of the things you learn if you have been in this long enough is to sell to the woman when they come in.  If the woman likes it the man, many times, will be fine living there because ""happy wife (or SO), happy life."""
RealEstate,3btifz,minze,-2,Thu Jul 2 12:20:13 2015 UTC,"With respect, OP does not need to look at this from a business standpoint.  OP needs to comply with the terms of their lease. Burden here was on the landlord to make repairs in a timely manner.  Sounds like landlord has already broken the law and lease terms by delaying this. OP sounds very reasonable in agreeing to pay for this regardless."
RealEstate,3btifz,fezziks_human,3,Thu Jul 2 13:53:53 2015 UTC,"OP needs to comply with the terms of their lease.   I agree, and I would be shocked if there wasn't a clause in the lease stating that repairs need to be reported in a timely manner.  It's a standard item on pretty much every lease I have ever seen (as a tenant or landlord).  When OP failed to do that because, by his own admission, he ""didn't see the point in telling him"" OP put himself in the wrong.  Now he's wondering why when he did tell the landlord at moveout time the landlord was visibly ticked off.  I gave him the reason.  I said to look at it from a business perspective because OP again said (in his reply to me) that he didn't understand why the landlord might be losing out.  To understand the ""why"" you need to look at the problem from the other side....thus not as a tenant but as the landlord who has to deal with a tenant that didn't do what they should have and now might lose out a full month's rent because of it (5 weeks to get a new door delivered then installed means he could be looking at 6 weeks before a new tenant is in the place).  All this is because the tenant ""didn't see the point in telling him.""  Ninja edit - ""Sounds like landlord has already broken the law and lease terms by delaying this."" As I said in my first reply it is state specific.  There are over than a dozen states that allow 45 days or more  for deposit return which is why I told him his mileage may vary."
RealEstate,3btifz,Bam801,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:12:38 2015 UTC,"I wasn't wondering why he was ticked, I understood from his perspective and that's why I am being cooperative in wanting to pay for repair/replacement. But, like I said previously, I gave him notice of moving out 30 days before and no effort was made to rent out the place in that 30 days, so to claim the extra time after that 30 days is him losing out doesn't make sense to me. In my state it is 30 days for deposit return."
RealEstate,3btifz,RarelyRong,3,Thu Jul 2 16:12:33 2015 UTC,The law is the law. It shouldn't take 6 weeks to get an estimate for the repair/replacement.
RealEstate,3btifz,Bam801,2,Thu Jul 2 01:20:52 2015 UTC,"Tenants like me? Tenants who always paid on time, who fixed things instead of hassling the landlord, who cleans and takes care of the property, and when something accidental does happen they are perfectly content covering the damage? That's the type of tenant you don't want? You must envision some sort of landlord utopia. I really hope your real estate endeavors end up working out as you imagine.   I actually don't mind waiting on the door to get there and get installed as long as I get what is rightfully mine."
RealEstate,3btifz,wamazing,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:39:24 2015 UTC,"You probably should have let them know in advance, but at the same time, they could have gotten an estimate for the costs and returned you the difference or your itemized statement for deductions, by the state deadline. There's really no excuse on their part either. If it can't be fixed immediately, then an estimate should suffice. Of course this could be different depending upon where you are. I do hope they don't try to claim against you for loss of use. Honestly couldn't tell you how that argument would get settled."

If your husband is abusing you, you should leave as soon as possible, which means renting is your best option. Your money shouldn't decrease if you're planning on getting a job, and you'll actually be able to buy a place in a couple of years.

Even if you could manage to get a mortgage, Shiny is right that community property could make that place half his. Further, it's going to take you a minimum of 45 days to find and close on a property, and good luck hiding both your activities and all your paperwork during that time.  It's time to start evaluating alternative resources. This is my favorite charity in the whole world.

So much of the exam is rote memorization and some of it's conceptual (forms of ownership for example). In my experience, students need more than a crash course and a few days to do well on the exam.  I'd suggest you sit down and take 1-2 full-length practice tests and see how you do. Use that as your barometer for your preparedness."

End of the day - having an inspection done is a potentially valuable process to let buyers with less than professional knowledge of building systems, an opportunity for a professional to explain to them what to expect. To show what flaws currently exist, and what flaws may present themselves over time based on the visual evidence available."

Very frustrating."

I live in NC and I paid about $175 to have my septic tank drained and scoped.  That's probably not much more than it would cost to drain a septic tank which, depending on your use, may be due anyway.  Also, if you don't have enough land for a second drainage field, you may not even be able to replace the system if something goes wrong so regular maintenance is a must."

Foundation settling issues could be one, amongst many others that my untrained eye could see.  Think of it as a small price to pay for a 200k investment.   And depending on your area, inspections may not be as much as what you had paid prior.  In my area my inspection was $300 on the home we recently closed on.   Again, I think it's worth it for the type of investment a person is making.  If you feel confident though, you can go that route if you would like and it's totally up to you."

RealEstate,3bqrab,DelRMi05,2,Wed Jul 1 15:45:32 2015 UTC,That depends on how much you will be paying for the house.   Sometimes certain defects do not show up until years after a house is built and you would not want to spend several hundred thousand dollars on a house to later discover defects that a home inspection might have revealed.  But that decision is up to you.
RealEstate,3bqrab,hobofats,3,Wed Jul 1 12:11:10 2015 UTC,"This one is in the ballpark of $200k. What kind of defects could take that long to show up, but would be found by an inspection?"

To me, the systems are most important; 1) Heating 2) Structural Integrity, 3) Plumbing, 4) Electrical, and 5) Roof. You may be well versed in some if not all of these things.

If you're an engineer, maybe you can get a buddy in the business to come over for a $200 fee, and write up a report detailing everything you need to see fixed that you didn't already ""know"" about."
RealEstate,3bqrab,isskewl,2,Wed Jul 1 14:21:59 2015 UTC,"I only went without a professional inspection on my most recent purchase because I had walked through two previous inspections.  I did bring my own camera and note a few items, but for the most part the home was well cared for.  The only thing I've ever gained from a inspector was their willingness to crawl in places I didn't want to and to have a list of things they think should be fixed upon ownership, but were not necessarily items to not purchase the home."
RealEstate,3bqrab,NeedAChainsaw,2,Wed Jul 1 12:22:56 2015 UTC,"not to sound crass, but walking through two inspections does not make you a qualified home inspector when it comes to looking at a roof or foundation, hvac, etc. You are spending spending tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on a property you plan to own for several years. spend the extra couple hundred bucks just to be on the safe side."

The idea of skipping a property inspection really makes me nervous, but if there ever was a case when it seems logical, yours is that situation.  Just understand the risk you're taking on, if you find out a month after you buy the house that there's something wrong neither you or the seller knew about, you have no recourse."
RealEstate,3br7gt,culb77,12,Wed Jul 1 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"You're missing $10,000+ per year in maintenance. Beach houses fall apart quickly. Renters are jerks and break everything. Contractors who work in beach locations are slow, expensive, unreliable and do shoddy work. Property management companies make sure people pay the bills and only address maintenance issues that someone alerts them to (which you'll get an additional bill for). And, the taxes, depending on where you live and where this house is, will eat a significant amount of your profits.  Expect the first several days of each of your vacations to involve headaches - repainting, going to the store to replace the stolen blender, cursing the renters for riding your bikes all over the beach and not rinsing them off, buying a new grill every year because it completely rusted AND the renters will never clean it.   There will be poop stains on the mattresses. There will be bloody mary stains, or blood stains, in between the couch cushions. Right before a hurricane, the renters will leave a door slightly ajar which will cause major damage to the inside of the house.   I'd also expect your insurance costs to rise because it is primarily a rental property. And then anything you try to get them to cover will cause your policy to be dropped, or raised.

Any bird watching, fish spotting or history books? They're gone. Any photos on the walls that aren't nailed down eventually go home with some knucklehead. And blenders.

RealEstate,3br7gt,rand486,9,Thu Jul 2 03:46:45 2015 UTC,"You're forgetting a few expenses:   Cleaning Fees (~$4,000/year - assuming 20 rentals @ $200 each) Real Estate Taxes ($4,000/year - assuming ~1% tax) General House Repairs and Wear & Tear ($4,000/year - assuming a low 1% year - with beach houses in the summer, all it takes is one bad house party to trash your property)   Depending on how close your property is to the water, there may be large, unplanned expenses (hurricanes?)  My guess is the $50k annual income is a best case scenario and doesn't account for vacancies/cancellations, payment disputes, etc. Sure, there are some tax benefits but I think you'll be very lucky to come out even at the end.  Based on standard assumptions (20 year mortgage, 4% interest rate, w/ payments of $2000/month), you're looking at a mortgage of $330k. With 20% down, that's roughly $80,000.   Take the 80k, put it in a low cost index fund, and withdraw a few grand every year to pay for beach vacations. You'll end up with more money and less headaches."

Back to the house it is paid off and worth over 700k. Some investors/company built a brand new Marina behind the house.  My friend's dad who owns a sheet metal company in Mass built 3 giant houses it's like a small compound and his properties alone had all the neighbors repaint their houses. The people have taken more pride in their homes, mostly out of jealousy. My dad is pushing 70 and told me the house is mine. I was the only one in the family who ever stayed there.

We just had the sellers of our place redo a crawl space support joist after getting a structural engineer in to look at it...

That's how our realtor had us wrap our heads around it.   I wouldn't worry about the HVAC, that can get taken care of when the furnace goes out.  I wouldn't worry about the vapor barrier either. You should test for Radon if it's a concern in your area and have them install a mitigation system if necessary which includes a vapor barrier. The barrier itself is considered a luxury, not a necessity.   If you take those two things off the list, they may be more inclined to help with the bean replacement. Honestly you should have a licensed structural engineer come in to see if patching them will be enough or if you need more than that. You don't get far in these negotiations without hard statements from experts, you'll just stay in a battle of them trying to do as little as possible and you trying to do the most. But, if the engineer says it needs to be replaced, it gives you a better place to come from and the sellers would then have to disclose the issue to another buyer if you back out. Much better position for you to bargain from."

Look up the statute on security deposits in KY for specific damages (if any) for failing to itemize etc.    In KY the landlord must provide the account number and bank the deposit is held in on the lease too.

I don't think the tenants' rights would be any different per the state statutes, but as far as some of the other stuff, I wonder if it's any different due to the leasor being a large complex and not an individual?"
RealEstate,3br8b5,NumNumLobster,2,Wed Jul 1 21:51:03 2015 UTC,is it fee managed?  If the landlord has a license I could see them being in deep shit over something like this.  There is a much higher burden when you have a license because they assume you should know this stuff so any violations are intentional.    I'd probably be more likely to start throwing around terms like harassment etc and someone like legal aid might actually give a shit now :)    How large is large?    I'm really surprised anyone that managed to amass enough money to buy a large place is running around randomly entering to go through tenants things.    as per statutes though I wouldn't think it would matter.

I mean one shitty employee doing something illegal isn't something the commission will care about, but if they don't do anything about this once they are aware of it or this is common place with all employees with no policies to operate lawfully, then I think the state would start caring.

RealEstate,3bsia2,ShortWoman,2,Wed Jul 1 20:27:55 2015 UTC,"Ok. Here's what I suggest you do. First, talk to a mortgage guy about your options. Be specific about what you want to do. Second, do not fall in love with any particular house. A lot can happen before that or any property is yours. Third, if you have not done so you need to interview some buyers agents. Ideally you want one who has experience in the kind of properties you are interested in. It seems to me that this is the kind of space where listings might not pop up on the big real estate sites.  TLDR: You need more information before deciding whether this is a good idea or not.  Good luck!"

My step father is my buyers agent, he's quite sharp that old guy is.  Im going to go see this house in person tomorrow to really access the condition visually.  I personally didn't want to spend anything more than 250 - 300 ---- I want money left over for other stuff - but it became clear a while back this is just almost impossible unless I just stay right where I am!

RealEstate,3bt8sr,NumNumLobster,2,Thu Jul 2 00:04:43 2015 UTC,"what was your degree in?  I'd probably try to find a job in construction, or a job somehow related to real estate.    It sounds like you have limited capital and income in a fairly an expensive market.  Do you know anyone who would loan you money?  If you want to go it alone your options are probably to find a POS that you are going to dump a ton of time into, and all your savings just to close, and then have to rent out the spare bedrooms.    You can do wholesaling (well theoretically, i'm not touching the legalities of that).  About 95% fail at that and the other 5% are pretty god damn smart and good at business in general and quickly seem to move on.    You live at home and have 20k saved.  Ever consider becoming a realtor? at least you get some experience with finding properties, sales, and just talking to people in a business environment who aren't children.  Wouldn't be a horrible idea.    You really just don't have enough to invest in that type of market.  I'd focus more on being the guy who gets paid to work in real estate in some capacity rather than the investor.  Let other people teach you, pay you, and make mistakes on their dime.  Then when you do it on yours you will have better chances"
RealEstate,3bt8sr,NumNumLobster,0,Thu Jul 2 00:29:58 2015 UTC,"All good advice. Thanks, and I have thought about becoming a realtor and could definitely see myself doing that soon.  My general idea was to take my FHA loan with 3.5% down, roughly 10k on a 300kish house, and invest in a duplex or triple. Take 5kish for small renovations (saving 5k for emergencies) and then rent the unit(s) while occupying the remaining unit(s), and hopefully live mortgage free for a couple of years while continuing to save. At that point I would move out into a starter home, rent my old unit, and go from there. Does that make sense?"
RealEstate,3bt8sr,NumNumLobster,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:39:29 2015 UTC,"That puts you at $1369 into a mortgage with say $500 in taxes & insurance (probably light) we are at just over $1850 as a monthly payment.  What debt to income is required for FHA?  Like 35 percent or something?  Your high end income is $3333 / month.  So you are at 55%.  Check with a loan broker about FHA requirements, but I don't think you are anywhere close to qualifying for that type of money.  This is ignoring the student loans too.  I don't mean to discourage you.  The buy a duplex idea is a good one and how many people get started.  I'd probably call a mortgage broker though and ask them to qualify you and see how much money you could honestly get.  That will help you figure out what options are realistic to you in your price range."
RealEstate,3bt8sr,slambur,0,Thu Jul 2 00:49:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense. I do think I'm still a bit of time away, I don't mean to do this tomorrow at all but it is a short term goal.  On the realtor side, any advice on how to get started there. I know in MA you have to pass a test, because its given in the same place I took teacher tests. I am very good at learning and testing well, so that shouldn't be an issue. Is there a job market for realtors? Any idea on how hard it is to join a brokerage group?"
RealEstate,3bt8sr,slambur,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:04:20 2015 UTC,"look up MA's real estate commission's website and it will say what you have to do to get a license.  Typically in most states you take some classes which can take between a month or two, some let you do it online, some don't.  Total costs are usually 1-2k.  Again I'm just very generally speaking, so check for MA.    Agents don't work as employees.  They are independent contractors.  If you have a license basically any brokerage will usually take you.  They have little reason not to, you pay them not the other way around.  Whether you make a career of it is a different story.  A very high failure rate is common.  Expect to earn nothing for 5 months or so and to work your ass off during that time so you have enough deals queued up the second half of the year to survive and get in a rhythm.    There are a lot of threads about this here.  Try searching around.  Others can give you better insight than me on this."

RealEstate,3bt5c0,snkscore,2,Thu Jul 2 02:16:04 2015 UTC,"read their leases and make sure there isn't anything else you are required to give them notification of.  Your leases should state how to handle 4, but generally make sure you give them adequate notice and make appropriate parking and business arrangements if it will harm them.  For example, its common to do some of that work outside of business hours if it will shut them down, and its practical to do so.    Make sure you send it certified to the correct address as stated in the lease or the last address the tenant gave to the last landlords.    If you do not have it, I'd also request the tenant's point of contact's information should you need to discuss business matters with them in the future.  Even if you do have it, re-requesting it may be a good idea as who knows when it was last updated was.    Thats pretty much it really"

A lawyer might be cheaper in this case, but many times in the past it has not been cheaper.   If you are buying a new home, beware of the builder if it is a large ""chain"" builder. KB Homes and Stylecraft , for instance, are two home builders in Texas that have a bad reputation due to shoddy construction practices.   Also, you definitely need to have a buyer's inspection on a new home. Absolutely and positively. One of my friends bought a home built by Stylecraft, and I have never in my life seen so many red tags issued by a city inspector during the building process. City inspection is usually a rubber stamp process and not a sign of quality or security. If you are having the home built for you, definitely ask to inspect before the drywall is put up. The reason that you need an agent or a lawyer is that a good agent or lawyer will give you this advice and will help you write it into contracts in ways that protect yourself... However the lawyer will be less involved and will not be proactive in giving you advice. It is NOT in the builder's interest to have you show up with an agent or lawyer, which is why they told you it isn't necessary."

If I am the seller's agent and the buyer shows up without an agent I will give my seller (who I am loyal to, not the buyer) a break on the commission and I will take a little extra because I know I'm going to be doing all the work a buyer's agent would be in the transaction, the buyer will get zero discount from me and I know I am not the only one who does it this way, very common practice.  Even in new builds, the sales staff has our 3% built in and it will not affect your price but we know what to look for to make sure they're building you a great house.

It's good coaching (I've done that too) but it's expensive and ultimately, they're just keeping you accountable to the same system everyone has. He will come off like a giant douche... did I mention that?   I hate how he talks about his fancy cars and all his money, but that gets a lot of agents' attention, so ignore it.  The system works if you work it, just like everything else in the world.    RE prospecting is like dieting, if you do it a little for a week, it doesn't do shit.

Also run the numbers, but typically over 700 credit score it benefits you to go conventional with 5% down. FHA sounds good with 3.5% down, but there's a 1.75% MI fee upfront and .85% for the life of the loan. MI on a conventional loan drops off when you have 20% equity (usually 10 years into a 30 year)."

Depends on other contract points too.  If you want to be involved in your property and have low authority amounts, it is more expensive for you.  If your property is a shit hole it is more expensive for you.  If your property is going to be marketed for sale in the near term it is cheaper for you.    You try Penklor?

All that means is that the bank pays your property taxes out of the escrow account. It's your money either way (ok, technically you are losing out on the interest, but that's so small who cares?)  Why don't you want escrow? I prefer having someone else remember when to pay the property tax.   EDIT: telling them they will ""lose your business"" with a refinance is meaningless to them. They make most of their money off the closing and then sell the loan to someone else. They won't care if you refinance with someone else in 3 months, it doesn't lose them any money."

It's got nothing whatsoever to do with PMI, and it's not some gotcha fee charged by the lender. That money is being set aside to pay your property taxes and homeowners insurance. The bank has a vested interest in making sure your taxes get paid because they don't want the county to foreclose and wipe out their mortgage. They also want you to have homeowners insurance so there will be money to rebuilt if Something Terrible happens. So by charging you a little bit every month, they make sure the money will be there when it is needed. This way you'll never be wondering where the hell you're going to find the money to pay your property taxes.  I am sorry that nobody explained this to you prior to closing."

I had no choice but to sign yesterday when i saw this otherwise my closing date would have been pushed even further(i had already pushed it for the end of the month and sellers were already compromising with me.) I had already taken the day off work for this and i told myself to sign it and then call/email them to waive it and then they throw me this curve ball. I figured being a first time home buyer and not knowing any of this process that they would fill be in with every detail which they did not. I am just annoyed at them not being upfront with me about everything. The original broker was a gentleman. The processor who did the work was extremely incapable of her work and did not really take the time to explain everything to me even when I asked questions. I felt more rushed off the phone than anything. I am assuming I CAN have this waived right? I just like controlling my own money in my accounts rather than having a bank do this for me. I am just very detailed when it comes to that and feel that it is my own obligation as a responsible human being to do my own work.

RealEstate,3bsjjt,dogwood876,3,Fri Jul 3 00:26:37 2015 UTC,"This is a stupid software and processes thing, to be honest.  Rather than force the loan officer to answer ""yes/no"" to ""escrow account?"" at some point after the deal is structured but before underwriting, some software systems are simply ""yes"" by default. Which puts some loan officers in the ""yes, by default"" mode unless you, the borrower, bring it up and bring it up early in the process. Not an ideal system that some lenders have.  At this point, however, after you've signed the paperwork confirming that you are OK with having an escrow account (it was buried in that 70 pages of crap you signed) it is something you should take up with the loan servicer. Because you put 20% down, there is a very good chance they will be OK with removing the escrow account."

Try to visit on a weekend and during the week as living patterns in towns can be very different at those times.

RealEstate,3bop7n,rabblerabblerouser,3,Wed Jul 1 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"Looking at the one we are putting on the market this week:   Total rent ($22k) - Property Taxes ($8k) - HoA Fees ($1k) - Cost to Lease ($1k) - Insurance + Misc ($1k) - Avg Repairs ($1k) = $10k profit on a $250k house.   We paid 180k for it ~7 or 8 years ago IIRC. If it sells for $250k, we make ~$235k, then taxes will eat a portion of that as it is a rental property. $180k in 2007 is supposedly $209k today thanks to inflation, so not a huge profit there from the actual sale either, and we got lucky that the market is so hot in that area right now. Two months ago we would have listed it for ~$235k, but prices are going up quickly in that part of the city.   Then you could take into account the time you waste on the phone / replying to emails when things go wrong. Half of my day was recently wasted when a hot water heater stopped working. We had a warranty on it, but the tech wouldn't be out for a few days, and the part that it ended up needing (we paid for our own tech) would have taken a week to order. The tenant wasn't willing to wait, so $1400 later a new water heater replaced the two year old water heater. If you don't want to deal with that, you can pay 5-15% of your monthly rent to a property management company that may contract out work to expensive providers or do more than necessary.   You might make a little more if you buy and rent a house compared to just putting your money into the market (at least in that area), but it isn't worth the hassle to me. Especially when we now live halfway across the country from all of our properties."

I believe it was a show about the next housing bubble.  It was not to say people are going out and flipping houses or renting them to become millionaires, but but the shear number of people who live in SFBA, LA, San Diego, etc what bought at low amounts then boom their house is worth 3X what they paid 15 years later they are millionaires.

I thought about mentioning that, but I felt that it was clearly cherry-picking even if it did occur in a few areas.   I think only a couple places have grown that tremendously in 30 years, assuming we aren't talking about large tracks of land that were developed into suburbs (which is one of the true main ways to make money in real estate, but you need to have money first to do it). Even in these places, like Santa Cruz, San Francisco, and San Jose, it's more like 75k to 600k. A huge jump since 1985, but it's not 25k to 1000k.  Two more key things that factor into why real estate investing isn't the greatest:   cost of a mortgage. Yes, you paid 75k to buy the house, but then you paid 150k to the bank to keep it. inflation. Yes, you paid 75k (or 150k), but that was in 1985 money. Yes, it's now worth 600k, but that's in 2015 money. According to this (probably shitty) inflation calculator, that 75k in 1985 is now worth 168k. That 150k cost of mortgage is now worth 336k.   To conclude, with inflation and cost of mortgage, that ""genius"" who bought his home 30 years ago at 75k, once you include cost of mortgage and inflation, really paid 336k. It's now worth 600k. In effect, he saw approx a 56% increase on his capital in 30 years.

Source: I have no sources. This is my opinion."
RealEstate,3bop7n,ornothumper,2,Thu Jul 2 15:51:12 2015 UTC,"He makes a couple of valid points, but his entire premise is erroneous. There's an idea that buying a house is an investment, which is not true. If you acquire an asset, you acquire something that puts money in your pocket. When most people buy a house, they are acquiring a liability that will cost them money over time.   Now, if they bought well and spent enough money on maintenance, they will get back some, most, or all of what they spent, and perhaps even realize a profit. They'll certainly benefit more than someone who rented for the same amount of money over the same  number of years as the homeowner. (As a general rule, anyway. I can't help you if you've bought a home with a sinkhole that gives way beneath it.)  Because of this, homeowners eventually see some financial gain from their purchase, but they do not realize ANY gain at all unless they sell. So again, they did not acquire an investment, but instead, got a liability that ended up not being hurtful.   On the other hand, investors can realize tremendous gains from acquiring actual real estate investments - properties that have one purpose: putting money in the investor's pocket. These are not purchases made because ""OOOH, this house is gorgeous!"" These are purchases made because the numbers make sense regardless of emotional appeal.   The author of that article used a $100,000 down payment as an example for a $400,000 house! I agree - it sure as heck wasn't an investment. It's too bad he didn't recognize that the same principles of hedge fund investments apply to real estate: You must evaluate the return on your investment BEFORE making the purchase, and have an exit plan. The risk:reward ratio must be sufficient to be worthwhile. And to do it really well, you should not invest your own money but instead, use other people's money."

Keeps cash available when you need it, and equity in the property when you don't.  Edit: also they're very cheap to originate. For instance, we do them for $99 up to $500k line.

RealEstate,3bq6l8,stanigator,5,Wed Jul 1 06:50:35 2015 UTC,I almost bought a house with septic issues last month.  Septics aren't cheap.  Repairs aren't cheap and putting a new one isn't cheap.  The estimates I found were $25-40k.  This is kind of crazy when you consider the value of the home around $150k.

RealEstate,3bq6l8,flyingwrench,3,Wed Jul 1 19:46:38 2015 UTC,"Locally neither is common, yet both exist.  Most people do not want the maintenance, repair and replacement liability, they would rather pay the water company to manage that risk, where a buyer's biggest risk is the portion of the pipes from the street to the house and within.    In addition, most people don't understand how either one works, and they don't have to, so they won't."
RealEstate,3bq6l8,landofmisfits,2,Wed Jul 1 07:00:04 2015 UTC,"Septic tanks are no problem, but people who have never lived with one, may be uneasy because they don't understand how it works or how to care for a septic system.  Wells are a whole other animal.  In my opinion, there is a lot more risk in buying a home on a well.  There are so many things that could go wrong and most are very expensive to fix.  The well could go dry necessitating digging that one deeper or a new one altogether.  There have been a lot of stories recently about contaminated ground water that affects people with wells.  This contamination can come from fracking, farming, industry, etc.  I live in an area where people have had wells for decades only to find that some company who had a manufacturing plant around here illegally dumped or disposed of chemicals and now the wells are contaminated.  There is also yearly maintenance on both wells and septic tanks and, if you can find a house on city water and sewer, why bother?"
RealEstate,3bq6l8,awhq,2,Wed Jul 1 12:31:47 2015 UTC,"I chose not to buy a house on well and septic, because I don't want maintenance of utilities to be my problem. Both well and septic have significant maintenance/repair/replacement if needed costs, and eliminating that entire possibility makes my life a lot easier."
RealEstate,3bq6l8,3phoe,2,Wed Jul 1 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"Septic systems have a reputation in my area for not working properly- clogging up, breaking down, being expensive, etc.  It's 90% because people don't know how to properly care for a septic system but many people also don't want to learn.    Also, in my area, it's not unknown to buy a home with a septic system and have the city come through a few years later and mandate connecting the house to the city water system- at the owner's expense.  This is thousands of dollars of work and you can't refuse.  As far as well water, many people don't like the taste and are afraid of the maintanance costs.  Again, a lot of this is simply ignorance."
RealEstate,3bq6l8,vengeance_pigeon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:04:31 2015 UTC,"Just depends on the area and how common they are. Around here once you get outside the city septic systems are very common. Individual wells are less common, though neighborhood or community wells are fairly common.  Really it comes down to the area and what is typical. I've never heard about people being ""afraid"" of wells and septic unless you are talking about city folk moving to the country and making a TV show."
RealEstate,3bq6l8,DCCWA,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:57:47 2015 UTC,"Septics are pretty common around here, in outlying areas that aren't hooked up to sewers. But they can be expensive to maintain over time. It's probably the same cost (or even less) than paying a monthly sewer charge but when it shows up in a big bill every 10 or 20 years that can be a bitter pill to swallow.   Also out west wells aren't guaranteed; some people in even nice areas have to truck in their water every week when the well runs dry. Not a fun position to be in."
RealEstate,3bq6l8,wamazing,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:37:16 2015 UTC,"It depends on your market, actually.  I'm in central Indiana, and there are a lot of people out here whose biggest goal is a house in the country.  Well & septic come with the territory.  Whether or not they're a deal breaker, that just depends on how badly the buyer wants the rest of the property.  It might be due to the fact that a lot of us around here grew up around houses with a well/septic, but they seem to rarely ever be deal breakers.    Plus, you can do your due diligence and hire the right inspectors to check out the systems and see if they have any contamination, or if they look like their life span is running low."

I am not allowed to advise my sellers what to disclose, the form specifically states this.  Just know this, if you don't disclose something that is on the form for your state to be disclosed, and the buyer has an issue with it down the road, you can be held liable through court action.  If you add your state to the commentary, there may be someone here from your state that can provide you direction specifically for your state.

Its required in my state, Nv, that you disclose the option of Home Insurance (home insurance disclosure), a Residential Disclosure guide, and if you live in a common interest community, you must include a CIC disclosure (common interest community)/HOA disclosure.  Regarding the SRPD (seller's real property disclosure), your are not required to disclose if someone died in the house, and murders, etc.  If it flooded, you must disclose. If there was ANY problem/issues/defects with the house. As well has any liens, mold, etc.   You might, like /u/landofmisfits pointed out, think about hiring a realtor. Or even a R.E. Lawyer to get you all the proper forms. You don't only hire a Realtor for all the forms. But to help take liability off of you and handle the transaction with professionalism and negotiate your price for top dollar. If your not familiar with your current market. You will need to be. Is your market one where pricing low is necessary? Are you aware of the homes that sold in your neighborhood? Do you have a marketing plan? Are you comfortable/prepared to be hosting open houses to strangers? Selling your home can be a very emotional experience.   Call a local title company, and get your property profile/prelim.

Then they will handle the marketing to get your home out to interested buyers and explain the entire process to you as well as guide you through all of the paperwork and negotiation process when you find a buyer, both initially and after inspections, coordinate the closing with the title company or attorney, along with a myriad of other things that come up during the home selling process."
RealEstate,3bp9pn,Realestatehell,3,Wed Jul 1 01:35:04 2015 UTC,"Home warranties do have a place in this world.  A seller will sometimes pick one up to make their home more enticing & to deal with things that might come up during inspection.  Buyers really do like the idea that for a year after they buy the house they don't have to worry about anything. There are statistics also to back that up Anyway, off topic.    It's all a numbers game, as it is with any insurance.  They are selling piece of mind and service.  On a long enough time line insurance companies always win.  I mean they are a for profit company and you are buying a service.  So if you can afford the bumps and bruises of certain things, don't get them covered.    Most of us can't afford to say ""rebuild out house if it happens to burn down,"" so we get coverage for that.     In short, don't buy coverage for things you can adsorb the cost of if they happen to break .  In the long run just like the casino the insurance companies always win."

RealEstate,3bp9pn,ajfa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 01:37:54 2015 UTC,"Usually, home warranties are pretty useless. If the home was lived in and used before sale, and most of the appliances stay, I'd pocket the $500. The main reason is that the $100 deductible is really close to the average repair cost for the typical things that go wrong (AC recharge, garbage disposal, furnace pilot light repair, dishwasher hookup), and you'd really have to have 4--5 of these things go wrong before you break even on the warranty.   One exception is when the house was recently ""remodeled"" with a new kitchen or new appliances that look great for staging but weren't tested or installed properly. In that case, the home warranty is absolutely worth it.   I'd just ask for the cost of the warranty to be contributed towards closing costs."

RealEstate,3bn5uc,PaulPocket,3,Tue Jun 30 17:49:10 2015 UTC,"the reason it's being done is generally one of two things:  a) they don't now much about it/don't want to deal with it, but they don't want to put it in those terms, so they'll just tell you ""nope, not comfortable with it"".  b) the process of telling you what gives her pause accomplishes 2 bad things from the lawyer's perspective: a) gives you legal advice that you're not paying for, b) possibly gives you enough rope to hang yourself. in either case, there's a good chance that comes back on the lawyer. this is the kind of situation where if you have a working relationship with the attorney, they'll probably tell you, but if you're an off-the-street, one-off client, they're not going to shoulder the malpractice risks and headaches, not to mention the unpaid work, by identifying for you what gives them the squirmies about a transaction.   to top it off, you're already bound by the contract?   yeah, in that case, you can also have the attorney running for the hills if it seems like you're now shopping around for someone to pin some blame on."

The main risk is multiple scenarios where you lose your earnest money.  If you are willing to accept those risks, fine. But if you cannot....

I'll note to in the specific examples I posted of using that strategy we weren't extremely successful, but everyone realized that going in and it way more than made up for the risk so that was fine.  Auction.com is a private company.  I have no idea how you find out who won, but suspect /u/dccwa may be correct that you have to wait until its recorded."
RealEstate,3bn5uc,witoldc,2,Tue Jun 30 18:27:06 2015 UTC,"auction.com and Hubzu have taken over a lot of FHA foreclosures. Many times there is no due diligence period allowed once a buyer has put a property under contract through them.  I lend hard money to buy real estate and warn all potential borrowers to avoid auction.com and Hubzu because they usually don't allow a due diligence period. I had one person approach me for a loan after putting a property under contract through Hubzu and, after I researched the comps and estimated rehab costs, I wouldn't lend her the full amount to buy the property so she lost her earnest money deposit. She had overestimated the after-repaired value of the house and really underestimated rehab costs. She was a newbie to real estate flipping.  I hope OP was able to get a due diligence period before earnest money going hard. With any REO I'm thinking of making an offer on or lending on, I always want a due diligence period. This pretty much means I avoid all auction.com and Hubzu listed properties."

RealEstate,3bpegp,young_casper,2,Wed Jul 1 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"If we get pre-approved now and chose to not use the loan immediately, say in 6 months if we then are ready does that ""count against us""?   What you want is a prequal then, not a preapproval. Nothing 'official', no credit pull, and the prequal will be as accurate as you are willing to answer and/or send paperwork in for.    You can verbally answer like 5 questions and a loan officer local to you can verbally give you a number that will be as accurate as your answers.  You can send in tax returns and paystubs, and a loan officer can e-mail you a number.    I would not expect a realtor to spend a lot of time on you based on this, however. This is if you just want a number that tells you what to look at when searching online.    How far apart should credit card openings and mortage loan applications take place?   If you're six months out, go for it but don't go crazy with the balance-carrying month to month."

My last card I opened was in March. Preapproved in May.  1) The underwriter will see your last credit inquiry was for a mortgage so they won't count it against you but the hard pull will dock your FICO a bit, if you are sub 700 I would try to avoid this situation. It'd be different if it was like a 20k personal loan or 4 credit cards; underwriters don't like that.  2) The longer the better. If you are opening cards for sign up bonuses and travel purposes, you just need to postpone this hobby (this is my situation). If you are opening cards due to necessity of cash and additional credit to pay bills, you need to swing over to /r/personalfinance and get that situation figured out before you take on a mortgage.  Good luck and have fun!  And for future reference, an experienced realtor should have answers on similar matters for you and if not, a phone call to a mortgage banker at your bank can answer these as well."

That being said, there is no reason to disclose that there was a natural death in the house, and a natural death will have no affect on value.  The majority of homes in my city were built starting in the mid 1800's to the 1960's.  I imagine a rather high percentage of them have had a natural death at one point or another.  Violent deaths in a house may need to be disclosed depending on your state and may have an affect on value due to news and neighborhood exposure."
RealEstate,3bped9,vengeance_pigeon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:57:34 2015 UTC,"Our realtor showed us a house that was previously owned by some friends of hers (several owners back).  One of the adults had died in the house of natural causes.  She was fretting because she thought that was a major deterrent.  I pointed out that most of the houses I had asked to look at were 100+ years old and almost certainly had seen deaths on the premises, as the concept of dying in a hospital is relatively modern.    But I'm telling this story mostly to illustrate that different people will have totally different reactions.  This to me was a complete no-brainer- why would it matter?

RealEstate,3bped9,DTDTD,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:19:42 2015 UTC,"A death by natural causes has no material consequences on a house, so it's not something that is required to be disclosed when you decide to sell. I think this has even been tested in court.  If you've ever seen a disclosure statement that has a list of possible defects with a check box next to each one, you'll notice that 'death in the house' is not on the list.  Besides, as far as you know, the death is just hearsay or rumor unless you definitely know the facts. Either way, it won't affect the appraisal.  Possible exceptions are if there was a decomposing body and the smell has not been remedied. Ew."

He said they have already locked the rate, authorized the credit card, order an apprasial and told me I can't switch lenders. Is that true?

RealEstate,3bnair,Mriswith88,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:34:25 2015 UTC,"I'll be hoping for 2 weeks. I posted a notice on their front door Saturday because they were home but refused to answer and had it dead bolted. :|  I thought that was allowed because of the keyless lock but upon re-reading the code it has to be mailed or inside the door unless it is both locked with a keyless lock AND doesn't have a mail box.  So basically, I have to re-give notice or risk it being challenged at the court date. This time I'm mailing it."

Also, do you have a written lease with them? if you have a written lease, the notice to vacate can be for only 4 days in the future. if you don't have a written lease, you need to allow them 30 days to vacate"
RealEstate,3bnair,ShortWoman,2,Tue Jun 30 16:40:08 2015 UTC,"I just evicted a tenant recently and here's my timeframe if that helps you (Harris County):  Sent Vacate notice on 4/23 - I am generous and give a 10 day vacate.  On 5/4 I filed for eviction with the court  Court date was on 5/18  I won my case but the tenant didn't move out.  Filed for a writ of possession on 5/28 (earliest allowed by court)  Spent the next week calling the constable's office trying to pin down their forcible move date, constantly getting the runaround.  Tenant moves out during this time so I stop worrying about constable.  All in all that is a fairly fast timeframe from start of notice to having the tenant out of the property.  Harris County is notoriously busy so probably takes longer than a court in a smaller community.  Good luck."

RealEstate,3bpv5h,yamaanon,4,Wed Jul 1 04:45:07 2015 UTC,"I am in Ohio also, I list these $4000 properties for the banks.   One potential flaw I see is that these properties often need more in repair than their end value as repaired is, therefore a renovation loan is out as it will cost more to purchase and renovate than the house is worth, which is one reason prices have been driven so low.  In addition, most of these houses, at least locally, have city work orders on them, meaning the government is now in your real estate business and telling you what repairs need to be done, when they need to be done by, and limiting who you can use to make the repairs and limiting the ability to do any yourself.   The plan you have outlined here is very simplistic and would need significant detailing and fine tuning to work.  (How are you handling maintenance, vacancy, management and on and on)  It can work, but it is also the exact reason that there are so many of these foreclosures in my part of Ohio-investors overleveraging themselves by doing just what you are saying and losing everything.  A decent amount of homes I have listed have been investor owned, not just owner occupied, and the highest percentage of the properties that were investor owned and lost were the properties in the 20k and under range."
RealEstate,3bpv5h,landofmisfits,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:10:42 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I see the city work orders on them as a good thing for the simple fact that I don't know anything about renovations. The renovation list with the estimated cost would at let give me a ball park estimate as to how much I could end up spending right? In regards to the handling the other issues you stated;  I have a family member that is a maintenance tech that I would use for any repairs. I would take section 8 vouchers which I believe will increase my renter pool. While I know it is a risk, I grew up in these neighborhoods and we be able to keep an eye on the properties on a frequent bases. I would hope I could manage the properties my self. Use a simple management software like Entrata. I am not looking to flip houses here. I know these are down and out areas to say the lease. But the rental market is big and I just cant see passing up on this opportunity."
RealEstate,3bpv5h,landofmisfits,3,Wed Jul 1 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"I am not suggesting passing it up, just suggesting you do more research prior to moving forward.    Renovation loans for an investment property are not easy to find, and if you do find one that works, may be hard money which is a very high interest rate, the end value will likely have to have 30% equity in order to qualify for the loan.  If you tie up 36k + loan costs (probably another 6-8k, so lets say a total of 42k) is the building going to be worth at least 60k when you are done?  In addition, your mom's credit will be a determining factor for qualification and interest rate as it sounds like it will be the lower one.  There are typically draw fees and high cost in addition to the interest rate bump, whether it is hard money or a traditional loan.  Your best bet is seeing if any small local banks offer a renovation loan for investors versus using hard money.  Hard money loans will also typically want to put a lien on an additional piece of property as well for security.  Is your family member that you would use for repairs on the city approved contractor list?  You will have to pay market rate for repairs because typically the contractors will usually receive a 1099 for the renovation costs, so he will be paying taxes on the income from the job.  Does your relative have a resume that the lender will approve him as a contractor?  Has he been in business doing this for an extended period of time and managing this scope of project, or has he just worked for someone else doing repairs as needed?  Do you have the funds to continue to pay the carrying costs while the property is being renovated and not bringing in an income?  Taxes, utilities, etc.  How long is the estimated work supposed to take prior to producing an income?  Is your relative going to work on it evenings and weekends or is this going to become his full time project?  Evenings and weekends only this could easily be a project that takes 6 months.  I think where you need to start right now is taking this proposition to a lender and seeing what loan products would work and whether they would approve this sort of deal as well as determining carrying costs and loan costs.  Locally, a 4k property is almost never going to have a 60k end value no matter how much money you sink into it.  I think you want to do this and there is a way to make it work, but I am not sure you are ready on the financial end to take the risk that goes with the reward, and I think that you need to do some research on what it is really going to cost before you jump into it.  Edit:  Also in looking at the renovation sheet one more time, there are material costs that are estimated on there, those will definitely change depending on what you specifically use, so this is a guide, not a bid."
RealEstate,3bpv5h,landofmisfits,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:57:04 2015 UTC,Do you think it would be a better investment to buy one of the empty lots and build a new house altogether?
RealEstate,3bpv5h,ApatheticMotivation,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:20:29 2015 UTC,It all depends on cost and whether you could get a lender to finance a new build in the neighborhood- so you are back to the financing issue.
RealEstate,3bpv5h,landofmisfits,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:35:24 2015 UTC,"What is the deal with the homes that are 4k?  Or was this a typo?  If 4k, why?  Can you cover the full renovation cost.  Can you do the work or will you be trying to pay contractors to do it all.  Buying with money that's already in your pocket is good, but, I'd personally rather sack the student loan. Get that paid off. And then save up the 4k and do the project, especially if there is an abundance in the area.   You don't really need an llc, an umbrella policy and requiring renters insurance covers the majority of risks.  Bringing your mother into the mix, she'd have to most likely be on the deed to take out a loan,  also a bank would probably rely on her credit more then yours. 23 and a recent grad, I'd assume your credit, if good, wouldn't have much more then a few bills and rent history.    Also, securing a mortgage using the homes income, unless you could repeat the 4k process, would depend on income, since the equity would be probably (guessing) low due to the area. Fresh rental income takes time for lenders to justify a lot of times, as there is no previous track record or performance."
RealEstate,3bpv5h,landofmisfits,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:12:36 2015 UTC,"Well the homes do start off at $4000 and that do to the major renovations that Need to be done.

My credit is better than hers I have 2 years of rental history and and a couple credit cards. I would hope we could both be on the loan so they would take my credit and her income into consideration.

RealEstate,3bnqjx,AMadHammer,3,Tue Jun 30 18:14:16 2015 UTC,"The downside is instead of paying the closing costs upfront in cash, its rolled into your mortgage basically which you're paying interest on. So it will cost you more. However buying a house already depletes your cash savings so totally that I'm fine with having a way to get more of that cash burden put into the loan. Its not a stupid idea, lots of people do it, just depends on if what it costs is worth it to you."
RealEstate,3bnqjx,junegloom,2,Tue Jun 30 19:28:51 2015 UTC,"you don't have to make the minimum down payment.  Its entirely possible to say take a minimum 20% down payment loan on 100k, get 5k in closing costs, and put 25k down or whatever.  Unless I'm missing something in the question, that would raise the purchase price for future appraisals/comps, which I think is what the question was."
RealEstate,3bnqjx,NumNumLobster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:30:31 2015 UTC,"A better example would be this 100k price 5k closing cost that I would be paying OR 105k price 5k that seller pays.

RealEstate,3bnqjx,FlyingBasset,2,Tue Jun 30 21:13:11 2015 UTC,I think this would take a big backseat to whether it helps you to have your closing costs paid or whether you would prefer to finance them. Even though it makes no real difference for the seller some have an issue with it.  For 90% of buyers I would say having them paid by the seller is the way to go as that money is likely worth more to them now than the extra $10-20/mo in mortgage payments would be.
RealEstate,3bnqjx,NumNumLobster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:35:10 2015 UTC,"The only downside I can think of is stupid sellers that can't do some basic math and wind up at ""oh thats bullshit!

Their are caps on that stuff too from your lender, so make sure you understand them and don't put your self in a situation where the seller will give you a max of 10k but the lender will only except 7 etc."

RealEstate,3bnqjx,German_Mafia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:25:41 2015 UTC,"I don't like the higher sales price option for 2 reasons.  1.) When your county assesses the taxes for the property they will pull from the recent recorded sale. If it is recorded at a higher price it means higher taxes. 2.) I don't think the higher sales price will benefit you when you sell unless you will be selling in the next few months. When buyers and agents look at comps they only pull from recent data, the last few months of sales."
RealEstate,3bnqjx,German_Mafia,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:20:21 2015 UTC,You need to talk to your mortgage broker and find out the absolute most amount of closing costs that they can roll into the mortgage amount.  You may need to be persistent and make sure that they know all the options for you.  What you are asking is done ALL the time.  The seller should not care about any of this as long as they are netting the same amount as a 'traditional' closing.   I have no idea why your talking about listing history though ?

I was offered a couple 6 figure positions BEFORE my CPM was complete.  I still get felt out once or twice a year.  Then again, being your own boss can be nice.  Even though it means you are probably manning the emergency line yourself. for the first couple years.    It's a lot of work.  You have to build a reputation over time by being consistent and by having your portfolio perform.  Get good with budgets and projections.  You need them to get to the next level above most of the others that just see how a property performs.  You want to show your client a reasonably close projection a year or more in advance.  You start doing that and they start having real faith in you.  Then you get referals.  Get great with people.  Residential isnt actually property management, it's people management.  Property is relatively predictable and there are experts for every problem.  You have a problem with people though?  You need to be the expert.  You need to be able to talk people into doing what you need.  Talk tenants into flexibility or patience or a cooler head.  Talk contractors into better pricing and quicker start dates.  Talk clients into actually sharing with your their goals from the beginning so you know what you need to do for them or if you can even work for them.  Shore up your morals and study ethics.  You will be presented with countless opportunities to put a bit of money into your pocket that should have been someone elses.  Lots of opportunities where no one will question it and no one will know.    It's a helluva fun industry with a little bit of everything.  Always something to learn, always something to improve.

He wasn't very academically inclined so quit school at 16 and got a factory job at a local small business that he'd worked at during previous school holidays. He was still living at home with the folks so didn't have any real outgoings.  ~18 months later he had enough saved for a deposit on a small 2-bed house. The house is basically the same as this, except back then they were selling for £50k.  The mortgage was initially in our parent's name as in the UK you have to be 18 to get a mortgage. He covered the full amount of the deposit though, and carried on putting much of his wage into the property as well as the rental income.  He's never lived in the place, it's always been rented out, and he had it paid off in full before he was 30."

RealEstate,3bnrxl,justwannagofast,15,Tue Jun 30 18:23:52 2015 UTC,"We listed this property at 110k two months ago as an investment property   That's your problem.  You've cut the potential buyer pool from everyone down to investors, down to investors that will invest in a condo.  Many investors, such as myself, won't even consider a condo for an investment because of the HOA and special assignments that can occur.  Also, inheriting tenants in my experience has been great or TERRIBLE. My worst tenants have been ones that I got stuck with when buying a 4-plex. This is yet another road block. Add on top of that the purchase price is $110k with 1k monthly rent PLUS a $140 month HOA. No. Way. In. Hell. Would. I . Buy. This.  It's a terrible investment, with horrible numbers and that's why you've received NO interest.  You need to get the tenant out and sell it to primary homeowners, not investors. I'd suggest mailing a notice to the tenant that you are selling the property and would like them to leave the property in 30 days. The tenant may just notify you they are moving out, or they may point to a lease saying they are allowed to stay. Depending, I'd offer cash for keys and get them out. List the property to real potential buyers and sell it for $110 (if that's what the accurate comps say it's worth).  Just and FYI I wouldn't touch this as an investment at $105k either. You'd have to be at about $80k before I'd even run numbers on this."
RealEstate,3bnrxl,PewPewLaserPewPew,2,Tue Jun 30 19:34:39 2015 UTC,"The cap rate is ~9% right, simplified rent minus hoa?  Isn't that pretty good?  What would be your criteria?  But agreed that the market is pretty limited.  OP, you probably have positive cashflow on this one?  Have you considered letting it earn money and try FHA for your new purchase?"
RealEstate,3bnrxl,hahcha,3,Tue Jun 30 21:26:30 2015 UTC,"I don't like using CAP rate for non-commercial property. I won't touch a property if the rent isn't at least 1% of the purchase price, but with an HOA you have to add that in too. So essentially I see it as $110,000 * 1% is at least $1100 per month in rental income, but you need another $140 to cover the HOA so rent needs to be $1240 minimum.  If you take the current rent of $1000 and subtract the HOA fees you're at $860 per month. Using those numbers I wouldn't even consider the property until it's about $86,000, however with a condo there are special assignments that can happen any time. You could all of the sudden have a bill for new windows because the association decides the current working ones are too outdated.  It could be any number of things and it's very unpredictable compared to only fixing what you know needs to be fixed on a typical property. This makes your maintenance budget more difficult because you're working with a group of unknowns and it's additional risk (from my perspective). Also an unknown tenant that wasn't screened by me is also worrisome.  It's just my opinion, but as an investor I wouldn't even be interested in this condo unless the price is about $80k due to the HOA and unknown factors. I wouldn't even take the time to go look at it and I'm guessing other investors are the same.  I think that OP has a much better shot selling it to homeowners rather than investors. I think OP should try to figure out how to go that route and get $110k out of it (if that's what it's worth).  Edit: Also forgot that HOA fees can and will increase too, probably in proportion to rental increases.  On a normal property you can increase rents with the market but your PITI doesn't increase as well so it's better overall."

RealEstate,3bnrxl,hahcha,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:05:44 2015 UTC,I don't own any commercial property. From my research it makes sense for commercial because the building is valued based on the cap multiplier. In residential the valuation isn't based on that and you can get goofy with the numbers to create caps that sound good but can be money losing properties. I don't think there is harm calculating it but I don't think it's a good thing to use to evaluate a residential property off the get go.

Also, though the pictures that are there are nice clear pictures, there are only 7 and none of them give an indication of the layout.  Most buyers start their shopping process online today and there are not enough pictures there to interest them.  My first thought in looking at the photos is, what is that weird space where the table is, in one of the pictures it looks like it is just sitting in the hallway.  My second is that the picture that shows the edge of the kitchen to the table, I see the exhaust fan first.    More pictures, wide angle camera, show the whole place, not just close ups of a few areas, people want to see what it really is before they commit to a showing.

A coworker of mine currently has a seller who is panicking, considering pulling the property off the market, etc, because the house has sat on the market for 30 days and ""only"" had one buyer, who's loan fell through. Turns out ADOM for his neighborhood is 33, and to top it off he's at the high end of the neighborhood's price range (always slower moving.)  As a rule of thumb, 0-4 months is considered a seller's market, 4-6 months a neutral market, 6+ is a buyer's market. I don't know much about Baton Rouge, it could just be that you need to be patient. If that's not the issue, and you really need to sell soon, then a price drop is really all you can feasibly do... but if that really is the only option, then $5k might not do it. If someone wanted it for 105k, they probably would have already offered that.

RealEstate,3bngwa,SeekingAir,7,Wed Jul 1 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"You could check deeds to see who the contractors were that tore down and sold to the eventual homeowners and contact them all for bids. If they made money on your street before, they surely would be interested in giving it another go. OTOH, you could check deeds for the price sold on the houses that were only renovated. If your house is comparable to those, and they sold for more than the teardowns, you potentially could make more money that way.  Contractors are more concerned with lot size because they know how big they can build based on that. Don't put any money into your house pre-sale if you think it's a teardown. Just keep it clean and clear the lot of any extraneous landscape material.   You don't ""need"" a realtor but you do need an attorney which in my area is often times 80% less than paying a commission."
RealEstate,3bo461,roberto0105,2,Tue Jun 30 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"Your lender is probably the best source of information. Ideally you have a local guy who knows your file that you can talk to rather than some random person at a call center someplace who only knows what's on his computer screen?  However here's my opinion: it all boils down to why they aren't currently FHA approved. Is it because somebody forgot a piece of paperwork? Then it shouldn't be hard to fix (although you might want to wonder what else was forgotten). Is it because they have over 50% rentals? Then it doesn't matter what paperwork they file because they aren't getting re-approved. The listing agent should know this.  There is no point in switching lenders because the problem isn't with your lender: it's with the community and/or the FHA. Furthermore, most conventional lenders use guidelines similar to what FHA requires. That means you can't just fix the problem by switching to a conventional mortgage. I think it would be reasonable for you to say ""Listen, if this isn't taken care of by Friday, I have no choice but to use the financing contingency of my purchase offer and back out. It's been over a month."" Obviously read your agreement and talk to your agent (not the listing agent) first.

I understand how difficult it is, and in my case, despite the advice of not getting attached to the house... I found that hard to do. There isn't much inventory to begin with, so that didn't help either.  I totally understand your struggles. I wish you the best of luck!"

Learned they have 9 already not even 24h on the market. This is the 3rd or 4th duplex where I've had that happen. To compete you either need a cash offer or have to be ready to go 20k+ over list which in this case I can't do either."

(House listed at about 7a, changed to pending at 9p that night. No idea how many offers they ending up getting during that time.)  I've read people's experiences of competing against bids $40k or more over listing price. (I've read that when it goes that much over, it's very likely just a strategy that people are using to lock in the house. And during the inspection period, they'll try and negotiate the price back down closer to listing.) That's absolutely crazy! Like I said, I haven't encountered anything that bad myself during my search, otherwise I'm sure I'd be a lot more frustrated. (In my short experience in the market, I found the lack of inventory in my price range more frustrating than bidding wars, but then again that's because I haven't been involved in any.)   I just had an offer accepted and I offered $5k over which isn't bad at all. But now I'm wondering if they would have accepted my offer at listing, as I believe it may have been overpriced to start with... oh well, no use in stressing over it now"

Likely the latter. While the job change makes sense (she's continuing in the same line of work, but essentially for a different employer), and she's shown that she has done self-employed work, someone saying that they ""hope"" to make a certain amount this year isn't supported in this case. They may be able to infer that her self-employed income would be at least stable from the previous two years, but likely not increasing."

RealEstate,3blp6d,braydengerr,10,Tue Jun 30 06:04:09 2015 UTC,I don't use a PM but I will someday.  I would be cashflow positive.  My one recommendation would be to get a PM that allows you to find your own repairman.  If you're trying to calculate the total cost of the PM and they use their own repair people you're going to have a harder time estimating the costs.  They might call the repairman out for all kinds of little shit and tack on little fee's or get kickbacks from the repair person.    I'd talk to other landlords that are using PM's in your area to get better reviews.
RealEstate,3blp6d,ReaverKS,6,Tue Jun 30 07:51:24 2015 UTC,"I want to point out that if your PM is taking kickbacks or ""rebates"" from contractors and not disclosing it up front, they are unethical and will probably find other ways to take money from you.  A good PM will know more repairmen/trades than you and will know who is good.  They will also have more weight which should lead to you seeing a better price or at least a higher priority.  This is not the case with all PM's so shop around."
RealEstate,3blp6d,tleb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:40:02 2015 UTC,"You make fair points, but knowing the right people and forcing you to use them are two different things. One is good and the other is unacceptable."
RealEstate,3blp6d,ReaverKS,3,Tue Jun 30 14:12:01 2015 UTC,I disagree.  My management agreement stipulates it's my call.  I don't want sub par work done in any of the properties in my portfolio.  So many times i have had to deal with crappy contractors that are slow or do a poor job that a client found through a friend or online.  I just put a stop to it.  You have to be on the same page as your PM and I have had potential clients that don't want to give me this control and that is fine.
RealEstate,3blp6d,tleb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:25:16 2015 UTC,"I always held the general philosophy that YOU can use whatever contractor you want.  I have a set I tend to work with for most things.  I'm reasonable on this and if you have a legit company you want me to use I can work with that.  Man even with bigger shit though I've ran into way too many times where someones nephew started a landscaping company, so they want him to handle that, but its his uncles property so he doesn't give a fuck and never shows up and then I have to deal with the complaints etc.    If you are telling me to use a certain person that isn't someone I think is reputable, my deal on this is ""thats fine, you can always use whoever you want, but I'm not willing to coordinate and guarantee services of someone I don't know and trust already"".  Not to mention I don't want to work with bill the maint tech who shows up an hour late, drunk and has no idea what he is doing.    I see /u/ReaverKS point, and I don't think anyone should be 'forced' since that leads to all kinds of other problems, but at the same time if I manage something I'm putting myself and my company behind it for both the owner and the tenants.  I do not want to waste my time dealing with people I don't consider professionals who will reflect badly on me.  Plus I can get professional services pretty cheap.  Yeah you can find some jackass off craigslist etc that will undercut my guys, but then you get the whole mind game thing going on too.  I do not want to screw with people who are going to use a shit ton of my time and deliver a crap product to save an owner $5 an hour."
RealEstate,3blp6d,NumNumLobster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:24:02 2015 UTC,"I just don't have time to deal with the problems you listed (actually I don't have the inclination or patience, I could spare the time).  By ensuring I make almost all of the property decisions and by having the ability to authorize anything under $500/incidence/month I am able to efficiently manage small portfolios.  This cookie cutter approach has been very successful for us. I am set up so that I can bring top level Property Management to smaller portfolios.  I do understand the problems with ""forcing"" my clients to use certain contractors, but I avoid most of those by not adding a surcharge for work and by standing behind their work.  If I send the wrong contractor or the contractors work is sub-par, I will make the  situation right at the expense of my own time or money."
RealEstate,3blp6d,tleb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"I should have clarified in my other comment...being forced to use your guys is bad because it feels like there's some kind of hidden agenda.  If I found a PM that said, ""sure, you can use your guys if you really want to, but I'm not going to hound them if they don't show up or anything like that..."" I would turn around and say ""Nah, we'll go ahead and use your guys.""  Because at that point it wouldn't feel like he was trying to pull a hard sale on me, because he was getting money out of it."
RealEstate,3blp6d,ReaverKS,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:25:03 2015 UTC,I replied in a different comment.
RealEstate,3blp6d,tleb,0,Tue Jun 30 22:30:04 2015 UTC,"kickbacks/rebates probably don't happen but most every property management firm marks up maintenance by 10-20% in their management contract.  If its in house, then they price it to make a small margin on it.  Handling that shit isn't free and it can be time consuming, marking it up isn't unreasonable."
RealEstate,3blp6d,NumNumLobster,5,Tue Jun 30 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"While it is common to see the mark up, I personally don't do it or agree with it.  Yes it is a pretty standard industry practice, but it creates a financial incentive to the PM to do more work, and not to try to keep work costs down.  A PM should not be financially rewarded more for spending more of their clients money.  It creates an inherent conflict of interest, whether it is common in the industry or not.  My % includes all functions of a PM and coordinating work is an easily forseeable part of that.  This model has been wildly successful for me and I have very loyal long term clients and am able to pay my employees well.  EDIT: forgot a not."
RealEstate,3blp6d,tleb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, which is why I said I wouldn't select a PM that requires me to use their guys.  It just feels like there are hidden motivations.  Now, just to be completely clear, if a PM would allow me to select my own repair people, I'd probably let him use his guys anyways, because that shows me that he's not incentivized by it."
RealEstate,3blp6d,ReaverKS,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:17:03 2015 UTC,"I don`t see how which party selects contractors has anything to do with tacking on a sur-charge.  I am very up front with my clients about why I am selecting contractors and not them.  I have an experienced guy who is intimately familiar with building systems and construction whose sole job is to keep costs down, get things done asap and ensure the job is done right.  That is all he does.  That is his focus.  He takes pride in it and he is good.  There is no way they are going to do a better job than him, and then it is me that has to deal with the problems that arise from skittish clients who can`t trust the experienced professional whom they hired to manage their property.  If you don`t trust your PM, you are an idiot to hire them.  By all means do your due diligence and pay attention to what they do.  No one is talking about blind trust.  But if you think your PM is letting hidden motivations sway them, then you do not trust them and no one should have anyone in charge of significant assets that they do not trust."
RealEstate,3blp6d,tleb,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:28:35 2015 UTC,"How can anyone trust someone they just met with managing hundred's of thousands of dollars?  Trust is built, typically over time, not thrown at someone, not convinced over a week or two.  If I have to start off by throwing full trust at you without the ability to use my own guy (not that I would though) then I'm moving onto the next PM.  No matter how you look at it, no matter how you explain it, people don't like being forced to do anything.  And they don't like when options are taken off the table.  Even if they don't exercise their options, the feeling of knowing that the option is there is significant."
RealEstate,3blp6d,ReaverKS,-1,Wed Jul 1 08:18:56 2015 UTC,"I actually do the same, except for capital projects.  My PM fees are higher than most and I get paid on the sale too though so its not always really worth haggling over those markups to me (which is why I don't).  If you do fair reporting (which notably a lot don't) I don't think there is a conflict.      Most people don't want to run a speculating business on how much time they will have to devote to a property they are managing.  Maintenance markups and leasing fees help them not have to do that.  Price your base to whatever it costs you to collect rent, have staff, answering services, etc etc for routine operations.  When something variable comes up you handle it, but there is extra compensation.    Do you price every property the same or do you charge more for older properties that you anticipate having more maintenance needs?    If its just flat rate all inclusive it probably winds up costing a lot of your clients more than taking the variable approach (though I assume the worsts it would save money for).    How do you handle larger maint items?  Say a stack cracks and is dumping water, which has soaked multiple sheets of drywall etc.  So now you are sending out a plumber (maybe 3 depending where you hit multi bid territory and how accessible this stuff is), a drywall guy after to clean up, maybe carpet cleaners etc and either your general maint crew to paint etc.  Thats a lot of overhead time in scheduling all that, you will have to look at it at least once prior, meet those people, inspect on completion, etc.  Then there are all those people you have to pay, the time you have to spend disclosing/discussing all this info to the owners.  I dunno, I'm not going to blame someone for not dealing with that for free.  A $100 / month pmf isn't even close to the cost of dealing with that one single incident imo.  This all depends on your size/scale and the contract too.  I'd look at that proposed incident very different if you are talking a house where spending authority is a couple hundred bucks and a larger property where it may be 5 or 10k with onsite staff."
RealEstate,3blp6d,NumNumLobster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 14:53:54 2015 UTC,"Capital projects on a larger property where I am Coordinating I may charge it on, and I will let the client know in advance what that will be.  If there is a consultant involved, I usually won't.  Almost half of my portfolio is Single Family though which is not common, so even a big item for a house (furnace, roof) is pretty easily handled.  I do straight through billing for everything.  I have a Maintenance Coordinator with a part time assistant that I am paying full time for whether he has something to do or not, so my costs aren't increased unless there is something significant going on that requires an inordinate amount of my personal time or attention.  I am mostly signing up clients that have long term plans for their property.  With long term clients I am going to have work heavy periods and times where everything is going smooth and I don't have to use many resources on their property.  I also use Leasing Fees.  I definitely quote according to the property.  The age, the management plan, distance from the office, and tenant profile/history all come into play when I am anticipating what it will take for me to manage a property and meet the owners goals.  I regularly have clients that ask me to assess their property management for other properties in their portfolio outside of the area I operate in.  It is not at all uncommon for management companies in nearby areas to quote 8-10% on a Single Fmaily property and end up actually costing 15%/year once all of their fees and add-ons are added together.   I charge my Fee, it is highly predictable for my clients.  They are satisfied and I am well paid for a good job.  It's win-win in my books.  Sorry if my answers are all over the place.  I keep coming back to this.  Month-End Madness."

RealEstate,3blp6d,NumNumLobster,4,Tue Jun 30 15:29:52 2015 UTC,"IMO coordinating repairs is part of property management. Let's say nothing goes wrong and they don't have to get involved past receiving the check for 10+ months, do I get a rebate?"
RealEstate,3blp6d,Flederman64,-1,Tue Jun 30 15:41:05 2015 UTC,that kind of attitude is pretty much how you get a shitty manager who is only interested in stealing you blind while the honest folks who just want to be compensated for their time see you as a time suck who will nickel and dime the shit out of them all day IMO.
RealEstate,3blp6d,NumNumLobster,2,Tue Jun 30 15:58:07 2015 UTC,"I think you both make valid points but I think this proves why ""handyman coordination"" type services are becoming more popular. Why the hell should someone pay 10% of rent for the tenant to electronically deposit rent every month?  Finding renters, vacancy time, evictions,, repair coordination, maintaining accounting records, etc all have big fees added on. What actual things are you still getting for 10% of gross???"
RealEstate,3blp6d,bjam2,2,Tue Jun 30 18:37:18 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.  All of the things you described are normal managment.  Inside of that is also my own incentive to have great tenants.  I make more money with a smooth successful tenancy with as few hiccups as possible.  Trouble tenants eat more or my and my staffs time.  Down time for repairs between tenants, or bad tenants that prevent me from having back to back tenancies actually cost me money.  If I am going to charge additionally for everything, then unstable tenancies are more financially rewarding to me.  The more repairs a property needs through abuse or negligence, the more I put into my pocket.  The more evictions, the more I make.    I am the freak in the industry for feeling this way, but it is so clear to me that I am not comfortable doing it any other way.  The trade off is that I will let a property sit, every time, if I haven't found a tenant I like for it."
RealEstate,3blp6d,tleb,3,Tue Jun 30 20:36:57 2015 UTC,"Seconding on asking other LL's for reviews. If you aren't cash flow positive using a PM, don't use one until you are sure you will be."

I self manage four units and have a separate duplex under a management company because it's an hour away.  By coincidence I had two hot water heaters go out within two months.  Guess which one was cheaper to replace?   The one the management company did, even with markup.  Why?  Because they are managing hundreds of units and have the buying power to negotiate a lower rate from plumbing companies than I was able to on my own.  So sometimes paying more is actually paying less."
RealEstate,3blp6d,caseigl,4,Tue Jun 30 16:26:41 2015 UTC,"After having some bad experiences, I would only use one on a recommendation of someone I know.  I picked some off Yelp with near-perfect reviews and it turns out they're perfect because some will sue bad-review writers, including myself in the end.  Literally going straight from a courtroom back to the court office to process more, all day long.  Owners hire managers to save time and going through a lawsuit is the opposite of that so owners are easy pickings for legal harassment.  Cashflow positive is the easy part.  The hard part is not having much recourse in case of a bad job.  There are certainly great managers out there.  I'm just saying the owner is particularly vulnerable, especially if you don't live nearby."

Hot water heater died this past year while I was extremely busy at work. I had no free time for anything other than work. All I had to do to get my rental fixed was say 'yes' to authorize my PM to spend the money and my part was done.  They did drop the ball a little finding new renters. You have to set expectations. A lot of PMs can be slackers. It's just like hiring employees for a company. Warm bodies are better than nothing, but no one will be as good as you since you actually care."

RealEstate,3blp6d,ThatLeviathan,3,Wed Jul 1 13:17:58 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Mostly, and only after refinancing 2 years ago to get my mortgage lower than the rent.  We moved house in 2009 and were able to get a mortgage for the new place without having to sell the old one (two good incomes, awesome credit); we were assured we'd have no trouble selling the old place in a few months.  A year later, after having had one offer that fell through when it failed inspection and having spent several thousand dollars on a new roof, we decided to list it for rent, and immediately got a great renter that we've had ever since.  At the time, we were paying about $1600 a month in mortgage (we'd originally financed our first home at about 102% of purchase price because you could do that sort of thing in 2003, and we wanted to pay off some credit card debt), and the rental income was $1200 minus 10% for the mortgage company, so we were losing a bit over $500 a month, though come tax time we were able to deduct interest and loss and came out okay.  In 2013 we scraped together enough cash to meet the 25% down payment requirement and refinanced to get the mortgage down to under a grand a month, so now we're in the black about $150 a month.  In reality, of course, most of that gets eaten up by occasional maintenance issues, but then again we also still deduct all the mortgage interest and other expenses, so at worst it's a break-even proposition, though the HVAC system is a bit old and I'm waiting for that to need replaced, that's going to be a big bite in the ass.  The management company is great; they email me if something needs replaced or there's a bit maintenance fee coming (anything over $500) but most of the time I'm just depositing a check every month while doing the standard evil landlord giggle."
RealEstate,3blp6d,1940,2,Tue Jun 30 13:44:39 2015 UTC,"Yes - I factored in the monthly cost of using a PM before I bought the property. If the property wasn't cashflow positive after that 8%, I didn't want it anyway. I am an hour away from my property, and I am very glad to have someone much closer to it, and someone who is well qualified and available to deal with emergencies.   I found mine through references from someone on BiggerPockets. They take 8% of the monthly rent and charge a 20% markup on repair work by acting as the GC. I think both are fair, though if I were more proactive I could probably save a bit on the repair work."
RealEstate,3blp6d,kegman83,2,Tue Jun 30 11:06:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, but all my properties are owned free and clear.  Tips?  Some stuff is needed repair wise, but some bad property managers will try and nickle and dime you to death with small repairs.  You should know what needs to be fixed and what is merely a suggestion.    I also recommend keeping a log of all repair work done at the house.  Keep getting a tenant that clogs their drains?  Either get a new tenant or fix the main line.  Do you know if you replaced the stove?  When?  Type and model?  Stuff goes a long way even if its to keep the PM on their toes.  ""Why does the stove need replacing when we did it in August of last year?"" is not a fun conversation the PM wants to have."

Even if you self manage, don't you want some profit for your time and troubles?    This is a mistake a lot of new investors do along with underestimating maintenance costs because they can do it their self.  You can, but if you are spending your time on something you need to be compensated for it.    Don't make a bad investment look like a good one by obligating a ton of time to it for no reward."

They also have their own handyman so they send him out to look at most things. If he can fix it, he does it for a really fair rate, and if he can't, I'm allowed to choose my own repair company or use one that my PM recommends.   I find that in most cases, if I'm referred a plumber/electrician from my PM, the rates are the industry standard and competitive.  My PM offers a 6 month walkthrough of my properties. I pay $25/unit every 6 months, and they send a guy out to inspect the units, take pictures, and point out any potential issues (that could become bigger issues). They send it to me in an email along with a summary. I really enjoy it since I'm out of State, it allows me to still stay semi-connected"

RealEstate,3bniam,zooch76,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:07:26 2015 UTC,"THIS! Our list of repairs for the seller was very modest, as we felt like he was being very reasonable in pricing.  We only asked for the ""major"" issues to be repaired, which included leaky roof and furnace that wouldn't stay lit.  He ended up having to replace the furnace and roof repair was fairly expensive. The receipts showed the seller paid close to $3k to fix those issues. Some buyers may ask for even more repairs aside from big ticket items. An inspection could even reveal problems that you weren't aware of.  Personally, after seeing the repairs our seller had to take care of, I'd want to set aside a least $5k for possible repairs if I was selling. I would set a budget and fix anything within that budget, or renegotiate pricing for anything beyond that budget."

RealEstate,3bnbdi,landofmisfits,3,Tue Jun 30 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"I don't believe it's about the daughter needing the money, it is about the Medicaid requirement that mom's money and equity all be spent down to a certain level before they will take over and cover her.  Daughter won't get anything out of it.  Medicaid usually does need to approve the sale to ensure that the house isn't just being given away to someone (especially family members) in order to retain some of the money, it has to be sold for a fair market value."

RealEstate,3bnbdi,SeekingAir,2,Tue Jun 30 21:47:01 2015 UTC,"To confuse matters for you, I wonder if Daughter has done her research on Medicaid as it relates to Mom's eligibility to receive benefits? To receive Medicaid in most states, an elder person has to have very minimal assets; some states as low as $2000, some states are in the $25k-$45k range, a lot in between. Mom can't simply sell the house and give the money to daughter and qualify for Medicaid because Medicaid has a ""look back"" period. Google ""Medicaid look back"" in your state. It'd be awful if you bought the house, Son didn't move out, and a few years down the road Medicaid is looking for the proceeds of Mom's house sale to recoup their care expenses for Mom."

RealEstate,3bl0j0,ptg33,10,Tue Jun 30 02:09:07 2015 UTC,"Without being able to see it I am going to answer assuming there needs to be some work done.  OK Best case scenario if the house is obviously sagging that much:  Bracing will be required to stabilize the walls.  Go into the basement.  Look at the walls / bring a level.  A structural engineer will most likely call the walls that are leaning over 1 inch.  Typically the engineer will call for one brace every 6 feet.  Each steel brace typically runs $350-600 depending on the company.  On top of that you are going to want to get the cracks epoxy injected.  This cost also varies from company to company but you can count on it being around $35-60 per inch.  Now that fixes the damage thats been done.    Now lets fix the source (Hopefully).    Grade work will most likely need to be done.  Keep the grade away from the house.   Code requires 6"" of drop from the point of your foundation outside to 10 feet away from it.  So get a measuring tape.  Starting at the base of the house extend it 10'.  At that 10 foot point, your grade should be no less than 6"" below where you started.  Here's the kicker:  The soil that you start at (the ""top"" of the 6 inch slope at the base of your house) must have at least 6 inches of clearance between itself and any wood siding or framing.  99% of houses I see do not have this.  Just interesting info.  Oh and if your landscaping just wont allow for your grade to slope away..you aren't alone.  But it still needs to be fixed.  So hire someone to install a french drain.  It sucks but..get er done.  Gutters.  KEEP THEM CLEAN PEOPLE.  Not once a year, not twice a year, not even three times a year.  Get your gutters cleaned regularly in the fall if there are trees above your roof.  4-6 times a year is going to save you THOUSANDS if you get a bunch of rain.  Lastly, downspout extenders.  Those big accordion looking things.  Any spot around your house that the downspout is just directing water to a splash block you want to make sure that water is easily feeding away from the foundation.  If its questionable then get a extender on there.    Worst case scenario:  Piering and Bracing.  Piers are incredibly more expensive and come in different shapes and sizes.  Some are designed to do different things.  I am far less experienced with piering so I will not try to give you more information as it may be wrong.  Essentially though, it ""hoists"" up the house from beneath it and must be tied in to bedrock.  Typically no less than two will be needed.  When you hear of ""20 thousand dollars of foundation repairs"" ....This is what they are referring to.  You will still have to do the exterior work to ensure the source of the problem is resolved.  Its impossible for me to know whats what without seeing it, but I would certainly be getting an engineer over there to have a look just to be safe.  DO NOT let this message scare you off!! If its a good house and all it needs is bracing then MOVE FORWARD through inspections!  If you like the house enough and the engineer says it just needs bracing then do the work yourself or have the seller help out with the costs.  Who cares if they say ""as is"" you can always ask.  If you get nothing, then so be it.  My point is that you shouldn't let foundation problems scare you off until you know what the diagnosis is from a structural engineer.  Sorry lot of info but its really basic stuff!"

We paid for one during our due diligence period and they ended up telling us we had nothing to worry about, definitely worth it and can sleep easy!

RealEstate,3bkyml,JonnyHall,8,Tue Jun 30 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"One of the neighbors has insisted that doing so is not allowed (safety issue, fire lane, etc etc)   Is it really a fire line? Sound like its not.  Anyway, there must be a valid legal reason to not allow street parking. Additionally, the man has no standing to enforce the law. He can call the police. So simply let him call the police, and see if its breaking the law. Worst you get is a $30 parking ticket, not likely to happen.   Mostly likely the cop will tell the dude hes a wacko."

I've come to advise everyone to do whatever they can to avoid them at all costs.    For example, check out this complaint here.  It is an all-out, full on eviction action lawsuit that started over BIRDSEED.  How did it start?  Read pages 7-9 of the full complaint here- it just shows what whiny b*tches the downstairs neighbors were... people like this when they have a proper ax to grind can make everyone's lives hell:    https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ubejNePdGpempTOFB4c3FOa3M/edit  ^ not my tenants, but I've seen cases like this in SF a bunch of times...   these people in particular struck me as extremely bitter, really entitled, and completely willing to pursue every possible avenue to make 1. their neighbors 2. the local PD 3. the property manager and 4. their landlords lives all hell.  It's actually shocking to me how much people will raise cain trying to correct perceived wrongs instead of just moving to somewhere more peaceful and more suiting to whatever lifestyle they want.    Neighbor wars should be avoided at all costs.  It's not good for anyone's mental health to be living in such a combative atmosphere.    What pisses me off about that case is the downstairs neighbors actually ""won"" after all their b*tching and the upstairs neighbors did get served with an eviction, simply because their landlord couldn't take the constant (trumped up) complaints.  I felt really bad for the upstairs tenants."

We have cul-de-sacs with homes and trailhead access.  Non-homeowners have been parking there and using our trails.  We put up signs saying homeowner parking only, violators will be towed and contracted with a towing company who started removing cars that were not authorized.  County found out about it after someone complained about their car being towed.  Unless you live in a gated community the streets are public and no one can prevent anyone from parking there.   The very thing that your neighbor brought up about emergency access was mentioned to our sheriff's office.   They said that modern firetrucks are designed with a turning radius that allows them to navigate cul-de-sacs that may have vehicles parked and the county codes require them to be of such size that it is not an issue.   Even if there was an issue there is sufficient hose length to deal with parked vehicles.  We had to remove all our signs and terminate the contract with the towing company.  So, if anything is wrong here it is your neighbor posting unauthorized signs."

RealEstate,3bkyml,SynbiosVyse,2,Tue Jun 30 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"My opinion on this with zero legal backing and 100% personal experience:  If you buy a property that doesn't suit your lifestyle in a way that you impede on others shared areas, then you bought the wrong property. If you have a driveway for 2, squeeze in 4, then still park one in the street, you're doing it wrong. I looked at a house to buy with a similar issue - they had 5 kids 16-20 all living at home, all with various SUVs and ricers. 2 in the garage, 4 in the drive, and one by the mailbox. 10 tickets later they were encouraged to realize this was a poor setup. Culdesac's are almost never cut in a way that on-street parking makes sense. It's okay for the occasional gathering or visit, but it's as much an eyesore as it is an annoyance for daily use.   Again, no legal ramifications here. But as property owner to property owner, I can relate. If you lived on a street that was made for on-street parking, then that's a norm and with any luck accommodation is non-impacting."

Their driveway was very large and could have easily accommodated all their vehicles, they just didn't want to have to play musical cars when they needed to leave.   Your neighbor hasn't gone about this the right way, but I do sympathize with him and I would ask you to be considerate of your neighbors. I would be willing to bet that even the ones that won't say anything would much prefer you to park in your driveway. The street is a shared area and it is somewhat selfish of you to use it to park a car full time.  Don't inconvenience your neighbors just to make your life more convenient."
RealEstate,3bjvt8,shaebay,12,Mon Jun 29 20:38:34 2015 UTC,"I have a rule my Father passed along to me that simply puts the client ahead of your own interests. There's plenty of opportunties where I could purchase a property my client wants at a discount. Does that mean I should do it? Of course not. Real Estate is a form of investing so it's not strange to see an agent that knows what they are doing purchase property and sometimes it can sometimes conflict with their clients interest. It's up to each individual to determine what's okay and what's not okay. But I am going to speak to your point on having the agent purchase the property and then you purchase the property from them. In short, absolutely not. That puts that person in a position of risk. It so happens the agent is willing to purchase the same property, but these are complicated transactions, while holding that property they could get into trouble selling it to you, whether you have trouble financing, an insurance issue arises, etc. In this particular case, the agent is at least telling you what they are doing, and that is they are not representing your best interests in this particular transaction. You can take that as you see fit. Does that mean they won't help you in the future? Can you trust this person? I'm not sure. I understand why you are feeling shafted on this, and in this case it may mean you should check out another agent, but I don't know this person or the circumstances. The good news though, there is always another house."

RealEstate,3bjvt8,spinlock,4,Tue Jun 30 03:39:52 2015 UTC,"Fiduciary duty is literally putting the clients needs before yours. I'm a loan originator, so, for example, it would be unethical and illegal for me to sell the client a loan that is not good for him (for whatever reason) just because I make more money."

RealEstate,3bjvt8,pikachu007,2,Tue Jun 30 08:47:39 2015 UTC,"""what fiduciary duty"" not ""what is fiduciary duty"". Fiduciary duties come in different forms, an investment advisor has the ""prudent man"" duty to his clients (i.e. he should only buy securities that a prudent man would hold in his own portfolio) but a stock broker has a fiduciary duty with a a much lower bar; he is only restricted to selling an investor ""appropriate"" securities (e.g. you need to be a qualified investor to buy into a hedge fund). But, a stock broker does not have a duty to sell you a security that he believes is a good investment."
RealEstate,3bjvt8,spinlock,5,Tue Jun 30 15:43:30 2015 UTC,"AFAIK Lenders don't require AC, many older houses in temperate climates don't have it (even some in Phoenix believe it or not...) But if there was AC there, the place has got an HVAC system, and someone steals it, that's now a repair that has to be fixed before closing. So you probably could not have gotten a loan on it. Cash buyer now needed (unless the seller is willing to spring for it).   I think it would have been nice for your agent to at least allow you to make an offer and see if you wanted to beat the other deal she had going. But I don't think this is an ethical breach. Houses get snapped up all sorts of ways, there will always be another one along. So she probably didn't even think twice about it. She didn't think she was screwing you over.    Nothing wrong with using an agent who flips houses but you now know this one is only half working for you and half working for herself. Up to you to decide whether you want to continue to do business with her and potentially pay her a lot of money when you do find a house. I'd probably see if I could sever our agreement and work with someone else."

RealEstate,3bjvt8,NumNumLobster,2,Tue Jun 30 07:46:41 2015 UTC,"Another thing you can do is write a personal letter to be included in the offer, with an explanation of what you love about the house.

They probably won't, because  You don't really have any proof of unethical dealing, but in my opinion you certainly have enough bad action on her part to part the ways and find a new agent.    Bragging about how much money she's going to make on it is just rubbing salt in the wound, and I think this is really crappy behavior on your agent's part.    Will an agent find deals before other people?  Certainly.  When those deals come into conflict with the interest of buyers they have a duty to represent, what should they do?  That's the question, and you've seen how your agent answers it.  I'd fire her and find a new agent, pronto."

People who monitor areas daily know the details and will call a new listing sight unseen to give an offer and grab it off the market.  Having shown her style, you probably don't want to send her more business from your eventual purchase.  Hope you've picked a new agent or used Redfin (refunds you back half their commission) to visit other properties."
RealEstate,3bjvt8,NeedAChainsaw,2,Wed Jul 1 02:19:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks to everyone for the advice, especially those who suggested a new realtor. I have officially broken up with their company.   [Boss at realty company I worked with],  First of all, I want to thank you for the time you have spent in attempting to get me into my dream home. Unfortunately, I don’t believe it is beneficial for me to work with your organization any longer. An agent should be representing the best interests of their client, and I don’t feel that is happening.  Example 1: On Friday, [name] and I went around to several homes in [area]. For no reason other than her wanting to check on it, she stopped by a property she had recently flipped and listed. She proceeded to give me a short tour of the home as though she hoped I would fall in love with it and want to purchase it (I’m only guessing on the intent and I may be way off). It was very inappropriate to take me to her personal listing when it was (1) out of the price range I am comfortable paying and (2) there was no reason to take me along when she could have just gone to her listing after our appointment was over.  Example 2: When we were looking at houses yesterday, she made a comment about a home having a sink hole, remarking that it was just my type. Yes, I admit that I keep finding and taking an interest in homes with sinkholes. However, I will defend myself by saying that this is Florida and sink holes are fairly abundant. I felt slighted and hurt by the comment. Making fun of your client isn’t always the best idea.  Example 3: Yesterday I arrived to the first house of our appointment and spent 15 or so minutes looking at a home while she talked with a utility company in [far away state]. I said it was fine that she was talking to them because it was important to take care of, but I was very frustrated that I was using up my work vacation time to wander around a home while she worked on ventures she viewed as more important than the client that was right in front of her.  Example 4: I feel that [name's] own interests as a house flipper come before the interests of her clients. I understand that she needs to make money and be successful, and I don’t begrudge her that, but that is the exact reason why I don’t feel like she is the right agent for me. I find it very disheartening that she saw a home, thought of me, and put in an offer on it herself so she could purchase it and fix it up. It was extremely rude that she then bragged to me about how she would profit from the home when I was distraught about not being able to secure it myself.  If the home would have issues securing a loan, I know there are other options to at least attempt to put in an offer and get a new HVAC unit installed (like an FHA 203k loan). I sent the address to her in a text and when I went out to meet her, she hadn’t even printed out the MLS listing as she had with the others. I had to bring up the specific property myself for her to tell me that it had an offer in from her.  I do want to point out that last Friday [name] proceeded to show me one home even after I informed her that it was under contract, yet she didn’t want to show me a home that was technically still available because she had a financial interest in it. I think I’m most upset that no attempt was made because her clients are clearly second string to her other ventures.  Personally, I think you guys are both amazing women and I had a lot of fun working with you and looking at homes. [Other woman at realty company I worked with], you were especially professional and I’m sorry we didn’t get to work together more. If it were a personal matter and not a business transaction, I would not hesitate to keep working with you, but because this is a huge decision and one of the biggest financial transactions of my life, I need to watch out for my own interests and have an agent that is on my side.  Thank you, Shaebay"

If I have a client who does not respect what I do and expects that I bend over backwards no matter how they treat me, I fire them.  I'm guessing that may be why you don't think your Realtor was pulling every string and going over the top to help you.    Just my opinion."

I wrote an email to the agent's boss and she was shocked about her behavior (i posted it here in the comments). Don't respond to someone else thinking they are me. I would never call a professional I need the help from a rat or whatever the other commenter said."
RealEstate,3bjvt8,walterwhitmanwhite,1 point,Tue Jun 30 21:39:35 2015 UTC,"Very sorry, you're right, I missed that.   It's a conflict of interest on her part and if she's really just bragging to you, that's kind of a nasty thing to do and I'd be angry at my agent if they handled it like that too.  Honestly, if you feel like her interests conflict yours and you get a bad vibe from her, fire her.  There are probably dozens of Realtors who would LOVE to have your business.  You'd be amazed what a Realtor will do to help you when you have a good working relationship.  Sorry again about the mix up, I just saw the little orange mail icon and assumed it was a reply from the person I was talking to, not someone who decided to interject purely for the purposes of assholery."

RealEstate,3bkp21,timsa01,7,Tue Jun 30 00:32:43 2015 UTC,"Read the leases. Ideally they were written by somebody sane and have a clause saying that in the event of sale, the lease remains in force between the current tenants and the new owner. So the transfer would be pretty automatic. Otherwise, new leases are your first priority.  The lease will also tell you how much they are supposed to pay, what the late fees are supposed to be, and how much notice either party is required to give to terminate the lease.  Other tips: Make sure you review rent records before closing; make sure you tour every single unit before closing; make sure you have an accurate accounting of security deposits; if you've got a troublemaker, make the current landlord get rid of them; make sure you understand state/local rental law; don't just write a new lease on your own, get one written by people who understand the law.  Good luck!"

Also, check what county you are in and see if there are any rent controls, rent stabilizations or other tenant protections.  You are effectively buying the tenants with the building, and you inherit their leases.  You will most likely be able to give them a 60-day notice that you are terminating their lease if you want them out, unless you are in SF or NYC.    If you're in CA I highly recommend joining the California Apartment Association, they have great leases that you can use."

RealEstate,3bl8cj,ShortWoman,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:35:51 2015 UTC,Get pre-qualified for a mortgage.  That will tell you how much the bank would be willing to lend you.  Maybe expect ~4x your income but up to the bank.  Speak to the mortgage officer about details to get personalized info.
RealEstate,3bl8cj,Toussant,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:36:47 2015 UTC,"My biggest piece of advice is don't buy a house you can't afford. Other comment is right, you can expect on order of 4x your salary in mortgage pre approval, but that does not mean you need or should buy a $220K house.   If you don't have children, buy a cheaper home in an up and coming area that you can sell for a profit when it's time to start a family some years down the line. Or just sell when you can afford something bigger/nicer or in a more established area, whether you want kids or not. Better yet, don't sell, rent it out and get passive income flowing."

A smart investor will not land themselves in the hypothetical you presume. I never said anything about ""right after"". Yes, buying a place and selling ""right after"" would seem pretty stupid. Wouldn't allow any time for appreciation. So why would you assume I was suggesting something so stupid?

With all of this the lender was not comfortable proceeding. It doesn't seem like they did anything wrong which is part of why I am conflicted. My choice, however, is not if they get it or if I get it. My choice is do I agree to give it to them, negotiate splitting it as wamazing suggested or hold out and what will most likely happen is that the money gets turned over to the state. At any point either of us could request mediation which I believe would be through the courts to resolve it but that would not be worth the hassle. If it got to that point I am sure I would win but I would rather give it back then take it that far.  Edit: I am not a lawyer."

You had to waste time and money moving your stuff out AND had to pay an extra mortgage payment.  On top of that, the buyer deliberately took a new job and caused this problem.

RealEstate,3bimch,flamehead2k1,9,Tue Jun 30 03:43:35 2015 UTC,The point of earnest money is to have some reassurance that the deal will close. The earnest money went hard.

RealEstate,3bimch,PaulPocket,6,Mon Jun 29 15:53:31 2015 UTC,I did sell it a few days ago for almost the same price as these original buyers.

If you're contractually entitled to the money, i wouldn't feel any qualms about keeping it. But make sure you're contractually entitled to the money."
RealEstate,3bimch,cosmonautsix,4,Mon Jun 29 15:37:31 2015 UTC,I can't imagine they have any legal right to the earnest money as they've likely defaulted (unless their financing contingency went all the way up to near close - doubtful). Offer to split it and save some karma?
RealEstate,3bimch,Suppafly,3,Mon Jun 29 19:10:54 2015 UTC,"What does your contract say? The language of the financing contingency is important, and should say something along the lines of    ""Buyer is in default if they do not make a good faith effort to obtain financing, furnishes false information, or otherwise causes the lender to reject or refuse to approve a mortgage loan commitment.""     Depending on the contract, it may make a difference if the buyer's actions were intentional, but probably not.  Holding someone to a contract does not make you a jerk, and the $500 ought to be considered compensation for the time you spent on a deal that didn't work out.    Now, if you wanted to return that to the buyer, that would be mighty decent of you.  $500 isn't much in the grand scheme of selling your home, but it could make all the difference in the world to someone in dire straits."

RealEstate,3bimch,itshotinjuly,3,Thu Jul 2 22:08:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know why this is down voted, because this seems like solid advice. We recently moved and our buyers offered us $3000 earnest money. They were getting an FHA loan and knew that we could go with a different buyer with a conventional, but they really wanted the house. If things would have fallen through, we would have kept the $3000, because that's how earnest money works, and they knew they were taking a bit of a risk getting an FHA loan.   We also offered $3000 to the people selling to us, because our offer was contingent on our deal going through with the other people. If it all would have fallen apart, I never would have asked for that money back. They would have missed prime home marketing time (late May to June), and again, that's what earnest money is FOR."
RealEstate,3bimch,steve4699,5,Thu Jul 2 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"It got downvoted because people in this thread do not understand how a real estate contract works with regards to earnest money.  That's the whole point of earnest money, lol. If the buyer violates the contract, then they lose their deposit.  I get it though, $500 is chump change, but that doesn't change the principle. That's why on the 2 houses we have sold, we required a min of 5k. Our properties were also in Colorado (Denver) and with how hot the market is there, we didn't even consider buyers without 10k earnest money, because anyone willing to put down a 10k deposit is most likely not going to fuck around when it comes to fulfilling the contract."
RealEstate,3bimch,Pappy091,4,Mon Jun 29 17:36:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Our market isn't as nuts as Denver, but houses are going quickly and for at least asking price. It makes total sense to ask for a decent chunk of money in that kind of a situation."
RealEstate,3bimch,quakerlaw,4,Mon Jun 29 20:11:08 2015 UTC,"No kidding, these people would hate me. When my wife and I were selling our first house we had a contract on a new one that and the sellers wanted $5k in earnest money (cant remember exactly why). We already had buyers lined up for our house and I asked for the same amount from them so that I would be covered in case they backed out and it ended up costing me the $5k I had put up. We ended up doing a couple of thousand dollars in repairs after their inspection period. Less than 24 hours before we were supposed to close they called and said they couldn't get approved for the loan (we are pretty sure they decided to back out and tanked it on purpose). As a result we couldn't put near as much down on our first house so our interest rate went up some. My wife was representing both parties and she emailed over the form that would release the $5k to us and explained exactly what it was in the email. He signed it and we got the money. A couple of days later the title company called her saying that the buyer had called looking for his earnest money. I ended up talking to him and he had no idea that that form released the money to us. He thought he was getting it back. I explained how much money I was out as a result of him backing out and that I was keeping the money. He wasn't very happy."
RealEstate,3bimch,awhq,4,Mon Jun 29 20:21:35 2015 UTC,"Yea definitely.  I don't care why the buyer violated the contract (laid off/changed their mind/sick relative/whatever). The reason is irrelevant, because they violated it and in the end, it costs the seller money.  The reason simply does not matter to the contract, which is why I never ask what the situation is around a buyer's/seller's actions.  If the buyer breaks the contract, they lose their deposit. When I sell a house, I'm not selling it to be ""nice"" or ""help"" someone out. I'm selling it to get the most money out of the property as I can and if a buyer fucks that up, then I'm not going to be out money for someone else's screw up."

That is precisely why buyers have to put up earnest money. There is absolutely nothing wrong with keeping it. It's not even morally grey.   It seems like a lot of people are down voting everyone that is telling you to keep it. Why? If OP shouldn't keep it then when exactly should a seller keep earnest money? What is the point of even having it?

The other consideration is that if the buyer's don't agree to let you have the earnest money, you will have to take them to court to get it.  Is that really worth your time (and money)?"
RealEstate,3bimch,EFFFFFF,2,Mon Jun 29 18:49:10 2015 UTC,I wouldn't return the deposit but for that small amount it's not worth it defending that in court.  If it gets to that point.

I think at a minimum you should expect to have to paint the affected areas and change carpeting. That could be quite a bit of money.... On the other hand if you can live with some odor or you're ok with masking it with air fresheners and potpourri then maybe you don't have to spend too much and you could take a half measure.   I think for a starting point for negotiation I would ask for the cost of replacing carpets and painting. Best of luck!

The smell.  The awful smell that came out of that room behind the door.  It was like the owners were psychopaths and that was their kill room.  I had that smell in my nose for hours after we left the house.  Our realtor immediately called the selling agent to let her know, you know, as a courtesy.  There was no way we were ever going near that house again.  I could hear the selling agent on the other end of the call literally screaming that there was no way the basement smelled."

RealEstate,3bkssm,rocksalt27,2,Tue Jun 30 01:05:27 2015 UTC,"First, make sure that country is providing your home owners insurance by verifying with them. Second make sure that American has them listed as the insurer. This is most likely correct but it can't hurt to double check and make sure that all is well. Second, since this money is escrowed, it's probably that your lender is building a reserve to cover when the payment is due. For example your insurance payment is paid once a year by the mortgage company but they have to collect monthly from you. If they pay it in September they have to make sure there is enough there for the while 12 month premium.  The other factor is if you closed recently, then did they collect any prepaid amounts to pad the escrow account? If not that may be another factor. Either way, this is usually not a big deal. There are strict laws in place limiting the amount the mortgage company can keep in escrow. If they have too much, you will get a refund once a year. If it's too little, they will increase you payment to cover the shortages for the next year. (Or give you the option to me a one time payment) Basically, unless it's an administrative type error, it will work itself out over the next 12 months. If it is an error, it should be found if you call both companies and verify the amount of the premium for the year, and verify the mortgage company is paying the right premium."

I couldn't believe I actually had to ""enforce"" it... but a tenant's mail order bride (seriously) developed a phobia to garbage.... where she couldn't have ANY ""garbage"" in the apartment at any time, but she also had a phobia of the garbage chute and the garbage room.  So the tenant would be at work all day while the wife piled up garbage outside their unit in the hallway.  Then he would take it down every night.  Obviously their neighbors complained.   When I tried to enforce it, they tried to fight me claiming she had a medical condition of being afraid of garbage and got a doctors note about how she shouldn't have to go in the garbage room.    Thankfully they were month to month at that point so I was ready to completely terminate their lease over it.  Strong worded 3-day or Quit to remove the garbage got them in line and they stopped leaving garbage in the hall.   She's a handful, we've had a few other complaints about them, I guess she bought a mini trampoline and used to work out on it all day, terrorizing their downstairs neighbors, also they get in loud screaming fights pretty regularly.

My SO wants at least 3 kids and I know the current home won't work for that. My thought is if I sold the home and the market went down in the next 3-5 years I would be able to afford more. It is a risk and thats why I am looking for others to chime in."
RealEstate,3bko0c,wamazing,4,Tue Jun 30 00:47:04 2015 UTC,"Park Place Estates? (am SD agent... :))  What conditions have to take place for your position to improve further?  I say that because our current selling conditions are fantastic.  I cannot say that they won't continue to get better, but with rates so low, its hard to imagine any better conditions than what we have.  Rates would have to stay low, which most would say the Fed will increase as soon as the economy can sustain the change.  Values would have to continue to rise, which is theoretically improbably if rates rise, and inventory would have to stay low, which shouldn't happen if the economy continues to improve (more people will sell, which could check values downward).  Demand would have to proportionately rise even higher than it currently is, again, an improbable statistic in my opinion.  So... If I were you and kidless, not locked to any one area, I'd give it strong consideration.  Though you can't say whether it is THE BEST time for you to sell, it's safe to say you had a great play.  You ever sit at the blackjack table and think ""man, I'm up $500, i should leave..."" only to sit and pursue ""just a couple hundred more dollars""... sometimes that works, sometimes the house kicks you in the nuts and sends you home :)    Right now you have money in your pocket essentially, and nobody can guarantee that it'll stay there.  Given that it seems like you'll have a life transition in the next few years, and you're not intending to keep this property for the long haul, I'd lean toward selling it.  If you were a family who is in their school district and happy where you are, that'd be entirely different. Lastly, keep in mind your buildings are 1970's built, the appeal of your complex in theory should wane unless the association updates the heck out of it.  RE: Value  6005 Gaines was updated but it wasn't in a very modern look.

RealEstate,3bk1w9,Stumpatron,6,Mon Jun 29 21:25:13 2015 UTC,"If you want to buy, don't wait. The only good time to make a business or life decision is today and yesterday. That said, there are a number of factors that play into buying vs renting. If there is a chance that you may not be in the area for more than 5 yrs...renting is probably a better choice. With houses selling for above offering price, if the market cools and you need to sell, you will owe more than you can recoup. Not good. But if you can buy the right house, in the right neighborhood, at the right price...you can walk away in 5-7 yrs with money in your pocket. Sucks to say but every market is hyper-local and your individual situation is EVERYTHING. There are no good cookie cutter answers. Rates will be going up at some point but it is unlikely to be overnight and any hike in the short term is unlikely to hinder your ability to purchase. It could limit your options but again your situation is much more important than interest rates. Lastly, in the long term (10+ yrs) buying makes a lot of sense if for no other reason than you get a static/fixed housing payment for decades. Taxes, utilities, and other costs go up equally for everyone but rents always go up...sometimes very steeply in a short time. Bottom line: you need to find out what you want to do. there are pros and cons for both and in the end you want a decision that you can live with and wont regret. That means finding out what you want and doing it. (finding out can be very difficult to do...but finding your ""why"" is the key to the whole thing)"
RealEstate,3bk1w9,firehillgroup,2,Mon Jun 29 22:22:21 2015 UTC,"I'm an agent here in Portland.  I'd say if you are planning on being here for 5 or more years, make an effort to buy.  Things have shifted slightly over the last couple of months (meaning many homes are taking 2 weeks to sell instead of 2 days) but it is still most definitely a sellers market.  You are going to have an easier time if you are looking just outside the city (Beaverton/Hillsboro, Happy Valley, etc). Even with rates starting to trend up, because our demand is so high from transplants, we haven't really seen it effect prices.  It's mostly a speed of market issue."

RealEstate,3bj7ep,Dozy-Doats,8,Mon Jun 29 17:46:17 2015 UTC,"Real estate agents have it drilled into them from the first day of real estate school that they should NEVER answer questions like ""is this a nice neighborhood?"" or ""how's the crime here?""  Some of the reasons are valid -they don't want to be perceived as being discriminatory (as Fair Housing fines are no joke & most agents value their license) and people previously were very much assholes about descriminating. But most agents don't understand that they can answer these questions in a manner that both informs their clients AND conforms to Fair Housing anti-descriminatory regulations.  In all honesty, it's very difficult to answer the question, ""Is this a nice neighborhood?""  I personally don't like seeing shopping carts on the street corners/in yards. Some people would consider this an upgrade from where they currently live. Many people here in Phx hate having a major street behind the house (and I honestly don't recco them for resale purposes). But then I get clients who just sold their brownstone in NYC & it doesn't phase them in the slightest. In fact, they love the quiet. There's literally no way to know that my definition of ""nice"" is the same as yours.   One way that I relay my assessment of a neighborhood/area here in Phoenix is, ""As a woman, I would/wouldn't jog here alone at night."" Phoenix is huge & I don't keep crime stats, but I can get you to the websites that do. I can also help you search out sex-offenders & their registered addresses (ps: don't ever do a sex offender search, you will lose faith in humanity when you see all the little dots that surround you). Because your tolerance for different variables is probably different than mine.  Now to loop back around to your original concerns (goddamn, realtors are long winded...), if you have an agent that doesn't know how to answer basic questions about a neighborhood without violating anti-descriminatory regulations, you may want to consider a new agent. She doesn't sound very versed in her industry & seems more concerned about covering her own ass than reading up on how to legally service your real estate needs. She might be new or a rookie, but either way, you may want to consider an agent with a little more experience under their belt."

We were just looking for a general answer to see if we should even bother spending any time doing further research.  What is the agent's job? I'm not trying to be confrontational here. I like our agent on a personal level and appreciate her time showing us homes and drawing up offers. If an agent isn't allowed to be truthful about the condition of the home and property or the neighborhood, then why not just use an attorney and skip the agent?

Can they say ""a few years ago this entire area had a problem with the sewer system so you might what to get the sewer scoped"" or, ""in the 50's and 60's builders and homeowners commonly used the free radioactive sand from the nearby uranium mill as back fill and mixed it into the concrete foundations so you might want to look into that"".  I was hoping that the agent would be more proactive in guiding us through some of these gotchas. I now know that we probably should have the sewer scoped on older homes. And we now have the information about homes built in the 50's and 60's in our area, but no one disclosed it and we ended up stumbling onto the information ourselves, quite accidentally. I know for a fact that the agent knew about the situation (not about the specific home but in general) and the sellers knew."
RealEstate,3bj7ep,ShinyLightning,3,Mon Jun 29 19:30:18 2015 UTC,"You are correct & realistic in your expectations of your agent. Here in the valley, there are many areas that have their own unique characteristics & mandate differing approaches. Some areas built during the boom in the SE valley had expansive soils, corroding slabs (due to our ground composition) & class action lawsuits involving whole subdivisions. I would suggest not only scoping sewer lines in our historic districts, but also in-depth electrical inspections at the panel for proper wiring/upgrading. The NE valley had a ton of spec homes built by ""builders"" who never built a home to save their life but thought they could make a quick buck in the boom -these warrant very in-depth inspections by highly-qualified inspectors who are versed in things like ICF homes or knowledgeable about IEFS installation. N & NW valley homes on private wells need to test for arsenic, a few areas also merit radon testing (which is a rarity out here). Agents also need to know things like, if you're using an FHA loan & the home you want to buy is on a shared well with 6 parcels, it doesn't qualify for FHA financing standards. Because wouldn't you be pissed if you paid for both your home inspection & your appraisal only to have the house kicked back in underwriting due to the previously unknown FHA standards? These are the things that a quality agent will help you know, understand & potentially side-step in order to help save you money & facilitate a smooth purchase.   As mentioned, fair housing guidelines are very valid & are still very needed in this day & age (anyone noticed the broo-ha-ha over the SCOTUS ruling last week? yeah, we still have bigots in the country, not shocking at all but that really brought them out of the woodwork), but those guidelines don't prevent agents from giving you factual answers in helping you find the home that will work best for your needs. Or at least they shouldn't. I don't see the anti-discrimination regulations as anything that would keep you from being able to make an informed decision on the house you like best. I don't feel the two things are at odds in the slightest."
RealEstate,3bj7ep,Schlot,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:40:24 2015 UTC,"His comment was mostly valid. Here's a copy for posterity /u/Schlot:   A good agent should ask more precise questions, and direct you to factual/statistical sources to help you answer these type of questions. Honestly, after many years of working with young professionals, it's a slightly ignorant to ask if a neighborhood is ""sketchy"". Sketchy can mean many different things to many different sects of people. Regardless, agents are not allowed to steer or comment in that capacity. Try to replace ""sketchy"" with a more accurate descriptor. While we can direct you to statistical sources (demographics etc...), you're idea of ""sketchy"" really depends on your own perception, stereotypes, and mind set. Like asking if schools in the area are ""good"". Do you have kids with special needs? Do you have kids that are gifted? Is the commute time important? Depending on your family, a ""good"" school could mean one thing, or the other. I've always felt it was the agent's job to help clarify this."

However, I know the neighborhoods much better than my clients (especially the relocation buyers) and they are paying me for my honest advice. My job is to protect their interests and make sure they have all of the important information prior to making a decision. I should be able to tell them that the home is in a bad part of town as their adviser. Whether they listen to that advice is their choice.   Obviously there are some caveats to this and I should not be able to say anything derogatory, and I would not want to. However, if the crime rate is high and there are sex offenders on either side of the block, I should be able to tell them this openly. I should not have to 'code speak' with terms such as ""in this neighborhood home values tend to remain lower than the rest of the market"", ""homes tend to take longer to sell and at lower prices in this part of town"", ""this is a high rental area"", or ""you should make sure to check crime rates/sex offender list in this area before making an offer.""

Instead of saying walking distance, we really need to say it's <distance measurement> away, otherwise we would be discriminating again someone that is handicapped. You get the idea.   I also instruct my clients to check out a neighborhood on their own and visit the police station for crime stats.

New School (and the camp I belong to):  Showing that you have a cushion with which to work comforts listing agents in that, they know if there's some kind of bump in the road, you're not maxing yourself out & can probably handle it without affecting the escrow. For my listings (which I just finished reviewing offers this morning), I want to see a buyer who is MORE THAN qualified for the price they're offering."
RealEstate,3bign0,ShinyLightning,6,Mon Jun 29 16:34:43 2015 UTC,I strongly disagree. Showing a higher number will affect any future negotiations (I've never done a deal where the offer was the last word on price) and it's so easy to have your bank write a letter for the offer you're making that it's just lazy not to.   I guess I can understand your position but I've never felt the need to prove how big of a deal I can get done. I've only ever had one seller press me on my ability to close and he had lied on the disclosures and the deal was going off the rails because of that (not my relationship with my bank).
RealEstate,3bign0,spinlock,5,Mon Jun 29 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"My LO wanted to do a letter for each house I was wanting to put an offer in on.  The letter would qualify me for the property, not a blanket dollar amount.    Has nothing to do with buying to the top of my limit - the offer was coming with a letter to prove I could satisfy payment of THAT home with my offer."
RealEstate,3bign0,senilemunkee,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:27:58 2015 UTC,When you say 'with your offer' do you mean with only your offer?  If I counter another $1000 do you need another letter?
RealEstate,3bign0,senilemunkee,2,Tue Jun 30 14:14:39 2015 UTC,"Good question.  I took from it - that it leaves a lot of assumption.  From a seller perspective, they could assume the approval letter was for that price, or they could assume it was for the asking price.  That's a chance they'd have to take when accepting or countering.   When my offer was countered, we accepted and did not provide a new letter since the previous letter had been stated we qualify for the purchase of that home.  I felt like it worked out well.  I don't know what the norm is but both mine and the sellers agent didn't have any problem with it."
RealEstate,3bign0,ShinyLightning,3,Tue Jun 30 16:47:39 2015 UTC,"It's not about proving you're a big shot, just that you're not spending your max. It tells me you have common sense & are a good sensible candidate to buy the home. Everyone will have their opinions, but if someone is trying to strong arm you in negotiations based on what you actually qualify for vs how much you're willing to spend, then you negotiate by walking away."
RealEstate,3bign0,DCCWA,5,Mon Jun 29 17:03:49 2015 UTC,I agree with /u/HarryWaters analysis. A well above offer price approval would be a change from the standard and make me more comfortable about the Buyer's ability to obtain financing.  Beyond that it is not a number I really pay attention to or care about. However I see the pre-qual price fairly often equal or really close to offer price. Which means when we negotiate a higher price they have to get me a new pre-qual.
RealEstate,3bign0,andpassword,8,Mon Jun 29 14:46:06 2015 UTC,"...Which essentially entails emailing the mortgage guy and saying ""Hey, Paul...they didn't accept our offer at 145k.  Can you send me another letter at 155?  Thanks, man.""  10 minutes later you have your new letter."
RealEstate,3bign0,DCCWA,3,Mon Jun 29 19:18:33 2015 UTC,"Perhaps so, but there are a lot of buyer's out there buying at their max. Requiring an updated pre-qual at least shows they meet some minimum threshold before I talk to their lender."
RealEstate,3bign0,landofmisfits,5,Mon Jun 29 19:53:43 2015 UTC,"Buyers think that having a preapproval over what they can spend limits their negotiating power because a seller can see that they are able to spend more than they are offering.  IMO what you can spend has nothing to do with what you are comfortable spending and what you are willing to spend on a particular house, so as long as you don't get into an emotional negotiation, and your agent doesn't get into an emotional negotiation (which one never should, but I have seen it happen), a preapproval should have no affect on negotiations."
RealEstate,3bign0,spinlock,8,Mon Jun 29 16:28:48 2015 UTC,a preapproval should have no affect on negotiations.   Any number will have an affect on negotiations. It's called anchoring.

RealEstate,3bign0,landofmisfits,2,Mon Jun 29 20:46:08 2015 UTC,"Anchoring is first number, the list price is the anchor as I understand it.  I always consider the pre-approval to be the probability the buyer can successfully close a deal.  A buyer qualified/approved at 100% of list price will have more issues than a buyer at 150%."
RealEstate,3bign0,spinlock,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:00:58 2015 UTC,"So if I have a client that is preapproved for 250k, but they are offering at 150k, you think it's smarter not to let the seller know that they are an extremely comfortable position to buy this house, and let the seller think that they are maxing out their spending ability?  By supplying the approval higher, they are showing that they are not going to negotiate based on what they CAN spend so it has no affect on what they are WILLING to spend, and therefore transfers that power of the negotiation back to the buyer."
RealEstate,3bign0,spinlock,2,Mon Jun 29 18:16:38 2015 UTC,"I'd accept a slightly lower offer from someone with a higher pre-approval.

RealEstate,3bign0,ShinyLightning,9,Mon Jun 29 20:13:30 2015 UTC,The seller wouldn't accept one for lower and I would never furnish one higher that my offer. How is this even a debate?
RealEstate,3bign0,spinlock,5,Mon Jun 29 16:41:29 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't you provide one higher than your offer?  I would be very wary of accepting an offer from someone who had a maximum prequalification at exactly the sales price.

Really the pre-approval should only be relevant to a seller and agent for screening serious buyers who are already working with lenders. The only reason I could think of as a seller to not want a pre-approval letter though would be if the buyer was paying outright with cash.   But, yes, it is totally irrelevant to the selling price of the home. It is relevant to the buyer in helping them determine what they can afford."

Issue preapproval letter for, say, $450k and one for the exact offer amount. Realtor already has $600k letter.   Now she can choose between using...   a) Initial preapproval letter significantly higher than offer, representing max purchasing power. b) Preapproval letter a bit higher than offer showing a cushion, but that still avoids conveying ""I am made of money! Squeeze me for as much as possible!"" If there's a $300/month HOA, I'll put ""HOA: $350/month"" on it. c) Preapproval letter exactly at offer amount. HOA matches exactly, if applicable.    Mello-Roos, if applicable, goes on B and C too.  I don't think this is one with a 'one-size fits all' answer. Buyer's agent has likely had face-time with listing agent, and knows about the property (for example if the appraisal is going to be an issue). Put that to work, and pick whichever of option A, B, or C is best."

RealEstate,3bi1d9,Iron_man_wannabe,7,Mon Jun 29 11:46:31 2015 UTC,"I'm doing my first flip right now. Let me tell you, unless you are a contractor, it's impossible to know how much something will cost to rehab. Best thing you can do is estimate, and hope you build in enough margin to make it work.  I went to the big box stores and saw carpet for $0.69/ft. I knew I needed to add a pad to that price and they offered a $69 install. For 1300 sq ft, I estimated $1/ft. I was off by more than double. They measured and made me buy 1650 sqft of carpet, plus pad was $0.58 and then their $69 install turned into $900 after take up and haul off, stairs, tack strip and some metal. It was $3000 all done.  Paint was another one. One quote is $5k another is $2500. Tough to figure out a budget when things can easily cost double.   My point is, you should buy a house, where you think you can make money, even if the sky falls. Then get multiple bids for the ""same"" work. My plan is to do work myself, if the quotes are just completely out of line from my estimates. It's not how I like spending my time, but I do like to make a profit too.   As a side note, there are so many caveats to selling a flip too, that could affect your overall outcome. If the home is in the target market for many FHA buyers, you'll have trouble, because you can't sell inside 90 days and make more than 20%, and still get an FHA lender to accept a contract. That makes your market smaller on homes in that price range. Maybe you can't sell it for as much as you hoped.  There isn't anything that will teach you how to do this perfect, every time. Unless you hire your own crew, you can't control costs to that level. Buy with so much upside that it would take a disaster to screw it up. And even then, it might happen, but big risk = big reward.   I'm happy to open up my information vault on my first and second flip if you need more info."

Also, try not to buy things through big box stores, but use contractor suppliers, or ""builder outlets,"" you can save quite a bit that way to.  You can buy a great spray gun for under $200, and paint a house that size entirely in a day or so tops.  Paint is cheap, labor is expensive.  Plus, for 99% of aesthetic work in a sfr, you can youtube the work and figure it out.  You can make your margins so much bigger if you do the sweat work yourself."
RealEstate,3bi1d9,ApatheticMotivation,3,Mon Jun 29 20:28:17 2015 UTC,"I buy-and-hold, but from my own rehabs.. the main concepts for me are (1) negotiating on purchase - if you don't get a deep enough discount at the purchase table, it doesn't matter how well you flip it. It might mean turning down 99% of the deals that come across your desk. (2) planning and budgeting. Plan tasks, material costs, and contractors timelines in detail. Overbudget, especially on your first one, in both time and money. You might have it planned out to the hour and day, and then the town takes 2 weeks to send an inspector out."
RealEstate,3bi1d9,underwriter1,3,Mon Jun 29 12:02:30 2015 UTC,"This guy has it. You make your money when you buy. You collect that money when you sell. The level of improvement you will need to QUICKLY sell the house is to make sure it is one step better than its competition but not much more than one step or you are wasyting money. From there you will need a plan, a written plan, from which you can develop a bill of materials from which you can rough up an estimate of just materials. From that you can try to estimate the amount of labor necessary and multiply by your average local labor rate.  This should get you an estimate hopefully around 50%+- of your final rehab cost. Make sure to add your carrying costs to that (mortgage, taxes, permits, utilities, inspections, plus probably a few other things I've forgotten).  A couple of other tips: Don't half ass things. You will generally waste more time and money trying to salvage stuff than demo'ing it and replacing with new. If it looks dated, replace it with new stuff. Expect that EVERY serious buyer will get an inspection. If there is even a hint that something might be an issue (not even a problem, but just an ""issue"") get it repaired and/or replaced. Nothing kills a sale like a few ""issues"" found by the inspector (mold, old termite damage, something not working perfect)."

Cost me an extra $900, but it was the one thing, besides the kitchen overhaul, that every applicant commented on.   As for the wants vs needs. I separate the structural and aesthetic myself.

I see WAY too many people in this sub that have no construction experience that just made a rough guess as to how much repairs would cost. That is a recipe for disaster. Once your option period starts you need to understand that you are going to be busy for 7-10 days (whatever the length of your option period is). Get contractors/subcontractors in there and let them know you need a number ASAP. Stay on their ass until you get the bid from them. I ALWAYS tell contractors/subs that my option period ends several days before it actually does. That way they are not giving me numbers at the deadline and I don't have any time to put it together or get new/different numbers if needed. Listen to what they tell you about the house. If you talk to 2-3 different people you will know they aren't BSing you when they are all saying the same thing. The cheapest quote isn't necessarily the best. You need to balance price vs. how comfortable you are that they will get the job done correctly, on time, etc. Get your hard numbers and add 20-25% on top of that for surprises. If there is still enough money to be made to make it worth the risk then go for it. Keep in mind that the house is going to be someone's home. Make your money, but don't cut corners or hide defects that are going to come back and bite someone in the ass down the road. That doesn't mean you have to fix every little thing that is broken or damaged though. Every house will have some problems whether it was a flip or someone's house.  Just don't let greed get in the way of your moral compass. I've seen that happen more than once."

RealEstate,3bin3e,TOMtheCONSIGLIERE,3,Mon Jun 29 19:50:19 2015 UTC,Perhaps all potential buyers who want to buy for a primary residence are not interested since they don't want to play LL and the bank might only lend for primary residence.

RealEstate,3bin3e,spivnv,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:55:22 2015 UTC,"A lot of options. The owner can renew the lease and keep the tenant for another year, continuing to appreciate value on the house, assuming he or she didn't mind playing landlord in the first place. Or they sell the house. The new buyer wants to live there and terminates the lease. Actually, wouldn't be terminating anything, just wouldn't sign a new lease for the tenant. Or it's possible the tenant only wants to live there for a year, which is what most leases wind up being. I mean, there are a lot of ways for the scenario to play out."

RealEstate,3binf9,landofmisfits,-4,Mon Jun 29 16:12:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't bought anything yet. So nothing to be remorseful over. I'm free to walk away at anytime.   I'm asking if it would be prudent to. As I said in my last sentence, I'm happy to walk away from it if the numbers don't add up.   I was going to do the windows and carpet replacement regardless, knowing the roof would need to be done in a few years. I was prepared to operate in the negative for a couple months knowing I could recoup that when I add a new tenant into my current rental. But I'm wondering if things are just piling up beyond what would be reasonable.   It would be awesome if you could speak to that instead of making assumptions as to how I may or may not be feeling. I'm looking for math or any other insights, not misinterpreted speculation."
RealEstate,3binf9,landofmisfits,4,Mon Jun 29 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"I did address the financial situation-you knew these things prior to making the offer if the inspection hasn't been completed yet, I'm not sure why it is an issue now if it wasn't an issue then.  That is what buyer's remorse is-rethinking the agreed upon offer and getting cold feet-either in terms of the price or the deal all together.  As far as the financial situation, I'm not sure why you are buying at all now rather than just saving money for your dream home and being in a better position for that, and even potentially doing that sooner, unless you are just looking to add another rental to your portfolio and figure living in a single family in the interim would be more comfortable."
RealEstate,3binf9,landofmisfits,-1,Mon Jun 29 18:11:43 2015 UTC,"We have a different definition of buyer's remorse. Mine is regret after a purchase. Google would agree. Nothing has been purchased. But I digress, as it's irrelevant.    unless you are just looking to add another rental to your portfolio and figure living in a single family in the interim would be more comfortable.   Exactly"
RealEstate,3binf9,ArabicaBeans,3,Mon Jun 29 21:21:18 2015 UTC,"I won't debate the definition of buyer's remorse, suffice to say that in the real estate industry it is used as a much broader statement than Google gives.  That being said, to address your points- The well, if the seller is willing to split the cost, then you have a $2500 expense.  Windows, decent ones, double pane, standard size can locally be installed for $250 a window, so if the house has 14 windows that would be about $3500.  You are now up to $6000.  Hardwood is much more expensive than carpet, and that is your wife's preference, not  requirement for a rental property.  Locally it is reasonable to expect around $3.00/sqft installed for a medium grade carpet.  That would be $3600, anything you spend above that is to meet the preferences of your wife, which is probably a good idea, but a preference, not a requirement.  That takes you to $9600.  The roof, I have no way to estimate not knowing what the house looks like, the sqft, the pitch, whether it is a single story or 2 story, or how many squares you are looking at, so I don't know if your 6-8k is realistic or not.  Most resale homes don't have brand new roofs, or may have a new roof but an older HVAC, rarely is everything new unless it's a flip, so there is some expectation of maintenance of bigger items over time with any house, it just may be something different in a different house.  If you were buying locally to me, what you need to spend now is in the $9600 range, that doesn't seem unreasonable.  If the roof doesn't need to be done for 5-10 years, you will be collecting rent for likely a majority of that time, so you would not necessarily be going in your pocket to do it, your profit just wouldn't be as high.  To me, it sounds like your estimates are a bit on the high side (which is smart to prepare for worst case scenario), and don't get me wrong, you want to be comfortable in the house if you are going to live there for a while, but you don't want to do the same higher end finishes in a house with the intention for it to be a rental long term that you would in your forever home.  A couple of questions I would ask myself-is spending the money to do the updates going to impact your down payment amount for your dream home significantly?  Are you going to have to finance these repairs, therefore the end cost is higher?  Is the $1,000-$1200 potential future rent minus PITI, maintenance and vacancy enough of an upside to make it worthwhile as a rental down the road?"

The phone rang, and a lovely sounding lady had a very specific idea about what she wanted. I told her more about the property. List price was over $8M  Stay calm, shorty, keep it cool, 3% of $8,000,000 is what now??  Well, that kind of mental math can keep you from using all your common sense and seeing red flags.    So when can I see the property?   I'll set up an appointment. When can you come by the office?   Oh I'm not sure. Do you have room for my limo to park? The Department of Defense insists that I use the limo.   The wat??  Yes ma'am, I'm absolutely sure we can accommodate your limo. How is Thursday morning for you? That gives me plenty of time to set up a viewing appointment with the listing agent.  By this point, my broker has gotten wind of my conversation and is trying to figure out what the heck is going on and how he's going to help me close this deal. He smells money too.   Are you sure you can't just meet me at my hotel?   This is Vegas but I'm not that stupid....  Sorry ma'am, company policy [I'm an independent contractor and it's my policy not to meet strangers at their hotels]. Thursday at 10? Great see you then!  Tuesday morning, office meeting. Broker makes a point of announcing that anything can happen if you take floor duty, even a chance at selling an $8M listing!!! like ShortWoman! By this point, I was at ""that would be really really nice but I am not going to count on this at all.""  Care to guess what happened Thursday morning?

Start getting high grass tickets for a house I don't own.  Find out the 4 bdrm single that was behind my duplex and facing the opposite street was included in my purchase.  Fix up was around $10k for both homes.  Rents were $850/$850 and $1200. Collected rents for 2 yrs.  Ended up selling both homes for $100k.

I go into the house and look around.  4bdrm single in mint condition.  It doesnt even need paint.  It turns out the broker was afraid to go into the neighborhood, so she was relying on me to give her the value of this house (did you get that ??? they wanted the purchaser to tell them what it was worth !!!!)  So I'm on the phone in the basement of a boarded up house, in a shit neighborhood, at night, in the dead of a NJ winter, in a suite and tie.  Bank wanted $50k, I offered $6k, they countered at $40k, I offered $7k but would close before the end of the year.  They agreed !!!

(We did have about $3k in repairs, too, for a total of $18k acquisition, and another $6k for updates and new roof before renting to new tenants.) Got $10k down payment and $750/mo for next five years on an owner financed sale. I was the real estate agent who had it listed for $35k and I paid cash.   Also partial to the house I got for a total in the low $40s, spent $12k on it then and another $3k since, and have rented for $800 a month now and four years at $750.

RealEstate,3bh1wg,MsTerious1,5,Mon Jun 29 06:20:30 2015 UTC,"My first flip was my best one to date. My wife was representing some friends of ours who were trying to buy a short sale from BoA. They had an accepted cash offer and they waited over a YEAR for BoA to close the deal. They finally got tired of waiting and canceled the contract and bought a different house. My wife and I stepped in and took over the contract (had to submit a new one, but same price, etc.) and ended up closing a month later. The house sat on 9 acres and there was a huge demand for houses with land at the time (still is). We spend $25k on repairs/updates and had an open house. Probably had 30+ people show up and look at the house. Ended up getting 2 full price offers and one that was just a little less. Closed with minimal fuss and ended up making a very nice chunk of change. I didn't think I would ever find another flip that I made that much money on that easily, but I am starting work on one today that has similar potential.   Another one is a foreclosure that we bought and did around $10k in work and decided to rent for a year or two. A family from Saudi Arabia moved in. The Saudi government pays for their living expenses while they go to school so their income is about as rock solid as it gets. They keep the house IMMACULATE and NEVER call with any issues.

IIRC reduced to $189K for a while and still no bids. Went up for auction for $135K. There was a bid for $80K. I bid $90K. Bank noted they were contacting all bidders for BAFO. I bid $95K and won. Bank paid ALL closing costs except $299 to the auction company which I paid. They even paid taxes when they came due the next quarter.  The bank was retarded trying to sell it for $246K or even $189K or even $135K. The place was not habitable when I purchased.

RealEstate,3bg2e8,I_play_trombone_AMA,20,Sun Jun 28 22:25:30 2015 UTC,"People confuse ""great for resale value"" and ""great for resale"". Any additional feature is great for value. What they mean is that the more your property conforms to your market norm for single-families, the quicker it will sell. It's more liquid and there's overall broader demand, but not necessarily greater demand.   Often the issue for less market-norm properties is function of less people out there who are even looking for 2 bedrooms. It gets more narrow if it's log cabin. Even more narrow for a water tower house. These are bad for resale, but not necessarily bad for resale value. Eventually someone may come along who thinks a water tower house is the bee's knees, and pays asking price."
RealEstate,3bg2e8,underwriter1,7,Sun Jun 28 22:47:00 2015 UTC,THANK YOU! This finally made it click for me. It's not about the value of the house when it sells...it's about how easy it will be to sell it. This makes so much sense. Now I have a better idea of exactly what reason I could possibly have to buy a house that's slightly bigger than my current needs.
RealEstate,3bg2e8,wamazing,8,Sun Jun 28 23:22:29 2015 UTC,"Ditto what u/underwriter1 said.   From an appraisal standpoint, the more common a feature is, the easier it is to put a value on it. If 2 bath homes are common in your area, no problem. If you're the person with the only 1ba or 3ba, it gets tougher. Not because I don't think I know what it's worth but because lenders want to see a couple other comps with the same feature.   There are also two principles of appraising you might want to consider. Regression and progression. The latter is what makes people say, buy the cheapest house in the nicest 'hood that you can afford. And that's true, especially if you live somewhere for many years. A gross (and, really inaccurate but for point of illustration) explanation is that things trend toward the median. Now that's not to say the largest and most expensive house in an area will LOSE money over time, but percentage-wise, it won't gain as much in value as the smallest/cheapest homes.   But really, all that kind of stuff is not as important as finding a house you totally love. If you're there 10 years, a few grand over an extra bathroom (or not) is really not that big of a deal.   The other thing to consider for resale: when you say you are going to 'do some work' on the place, make sure you pull permits for anything that your local municipality requires it for. Probably anything structural or electrical/plumbing. Lenders have gotten super picky about non-permitted work, and, it's possible insurance companies might use this to get out of paying a claim should the worst happen. Check this on any house you buy, that's been remodeled or added onto, before you get in too deep. Good luck."

RealEstate,3bg2e8,samiv2,5,Mon Jun 29 00:04:41 2015 UTC,"Great points here already.  Also think about how people's expectations about houses are evolving over time.  Look at how much bigger the average new home is than just a couple decades ago.  Look at how many beds and baths they almost all have. A one bath is an instant pass to a lot of buyers today.  A second bath was a luxury feature not so long ago.  Not conforming to buyers expectations can make a house harder to sell.  You can't predict what those will be in 15 years, but the trend is defintely toward bigger and more."

RealEstate,3bfcid,TOMtheCONSIGLIERE,-2,Mon Jun 29 03:57:32 2015 UTC,"Tom you gave a snarky response to my post so you got one in return. In no shape or form was I ""crying "" about anything. Maybe you should read the questions  again. Lawyers were involved and I fully understood the whole process. And don't know how you got that I had no understanding of what I was buying?   The developer is still in control of the property until the owners form a condo association. Until then we were asked to bring any questions or problems to the on site property manager. Who is rarely there and clearly isn't interested or possibly not able to answer the questions I have asked. I will be contacting the developer this morning.  Thanks and have a good day."

The property is on earth.""  You get the response you deserve. None of my OP is snarky but next time I will sound the lack of snarky alarm before I post, so you feel safe.  I didn't see anything about lawyers in your OP. How would I know? In fact the only time the word ""lawyer"" or ""attorney"" is mentioned is in our posts back and forth.  So finally, thanks for clearing that up.  The reason I said ""You're in this situation because you had no idea what you were buying"" is because your lawyer should have answered and explained that to you. Buying in a new development with a sponsor is a bit different than your normal transaction and has certain added risks involved. Since you don't want to discuss it anymore, that is cool.  I will do my best to have a good day."

RealEstate,3bh815,chiclanda,2,Mon Jun 29 05:00:16 2015 UTC,"There's a lot of things your friend is not considering and if real estate was that easy, everyone would've been doing it. First off, this is based off my experience as an agent based in California.  1) there are 2 types of licenses: brokers license and salesperson license. As far as I know, you can no longer obtain a brokers license directly unless you have majored/minored in real estate or worked as a salesperson for a minimum of 2 years  2) you can't perform any transactions unless you have a brokers license or work under someone that has a brokers license  3) generally leases will range from 2.5% - 3% of the total lease amount. Assuming 3% on a 2000/month apartment, you will net 720 BEFORE broker fees (refer to 2).   4) unless you have a broker covering you for free (family member or a very very good friend), you will need to pay some kind of fee (eg desk fee, brokerage fee, e&o insurance, office supplies, mls fees, NAR fees, etc) and it adds up.  5) next item, taxes. When you get a commission, this is the amount before taxes. Come tax season, you'll need to pay taxes on your income. Unlike a tradition job when you automatically deduct a bit from every paycheck, this will be different and you'll be charged in the end  6) lets play out an example. Say you go to a standard brokerage with a 50/50 commission split and brokerage fees of 500 a quarter plus 300 for local and national realtors fee and lastly 200 for mls fees. Before making a sale you're already down 1000 in the hole. You sell 1 lease at 2000/month, before your cut its 720. After cuts you net 360. You'll need to make 3 leases before breaking even (ignoring taxes for now). For me, I can turnover a lease in about 1-2 weeks if they're motivated. Let's say for you 2 weeks per lessee. While being a full time student, I would bank you could handle 3-4 leases max at the same time (10+ I would expect it to be impossible since you haven't had experience with the procedure, contracts, disclosures, etc). Considering your frat bros are willing to wait (mine are impatient as all hell), doing 50 bros will take 25 weeks, nearly half a year. I'm not trying to sway you out of it, but it's not easy as 1,2,3. You're friend hasn't thought it out fully and I'm glad you asked. Real estate is no longer something a weekend mom can do (well maybe but it'll be hard to succeed) and it takes real time and commitment. If you're trying to make a quick buck, do uber. A lot of agents shy away from cheap properties and leases because there's no money in it. Wait it out, have them graduate, when they get proper jobs with proper money, help them buy a house."
RealEstate,3bh815,Doctor_Pedobear,3,Mon Jun 29 05:44:26 2015 UTC,"Commissions on rentals in my area are more like $200-400 each. Obviously every area is different, but I can't really see $800 average being realistic.  It also occurs to me that college apartments are the very definition of seasonality: work like a madman in August and January, then starve the rest of the year.   As TexasCowBro said, there is no incentive for anybody to work with an agent for a standard apartment in a big complex. His plan might have a chance if he plans to do placements in rental condos and houses.  In addition to what Doc says about requiring a license, don't forget the time and money to get that license: pre-licensing classes, state and federal licensure exam, fees to the state, business license (both state and local where I am), post-licensing classes, broker splits, marketing expenses such as business cards, continuing education classes.   TLDR Why not see how your buddy does with this plan first? If he is insanely busy, ask if he needs an assistant."

Of course I'd help out friends, but the occasional house rental is far from my bread and butter. The most I can really do is help them search for a nice place and give them advice on prices/areas. Once I lead them to a complex they like, it's really between them and the complex. Not much room for an agent. (Don't take this as law, just my personal experience as a small-timer.)"

The big issue people run into is partial lien release if the seller has a mortgage attached- often the proceeds must pay down principle. I've seen that take years. But if the seller's lot is free and clear, usually it's a survey, town approval, new legal descriptions adding/removing the lots and changing the taxation. Some towns may not let you create a separate lot or parcel. Some towns may not let you change your lots depending on what today's requirements are and what they will allow to be grandfathered in."

RealEstate,3bel3b,saml01,2,Sun Jun 28 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"The first thing you should do is contact your county's Recorder of Deeds to see if there are any deed restrictions which would prevent the property from being divided.  The next thing is to contact the city's building department to see if the city will allow the property to be split.  Often, utilities are run next to a back property line so even though you may be able to split the land, you may not be able to build anything on it or landscape it with impunity due to the utility easements.  If splitting the land is allowed, then the land is usually added to the existing pin by having the legal description re-written.  So your half would be added to your original lot's pin and your neighbor's would be added to his original lot's pin."

RealEstate,3bggvr,jmoney6,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:35:59 2015 UTC,The contract would just be terminated. I see it all of the time in FL. If the HOA has the final word per their CCR's then there is nothing you can do. Nobody could force you to close and no title company would issue insurance on the deal.
RealEstate,3bggvr,acoupladrinks,2,Mon Jun 29 00:48:26 2015 UTC,What would happen to earnest money? And could you be sued by the seller for any reason?  Also under what grounds could the HOA have to deny you purchasing a home in a community?
RealEstate,3bggvr,acoupladrinks,2,Mon Jun 29 00:49:13 2015 UTC,It would get returned and no they can't because suing you to perform would cause a breach of the HOA covenants. HOA's typically have clauses in their covenants that gives them the right to approve buyers. Sometimes it will even state that if they deny a buyer then the association has to purchase the property which is something that protects that seller because then he doesn't lose the sale.
RealEstate,3bggvr,acoupladrinks,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:20:49 2015 UTC,Have you ever seen an HOA be forced to buy a property?

RealEstate,3bh31z,strangerwithadvice,3,Mon Jun 29 04:07:18 2015 UTC,"Why does the average sales amount for a buyers agent impact whether or not someone will do a good job for you? Just because somebody closes million dollar homes doesn't mean she can help you find a nice 4-3-2 with reasonable HOA fees in the suburbs.  Buyers agents never do as much volume as listing agents. It's mathematically impossible. I can have 5 listings while sitting at my desk, but I can only have one buyer in my car at a time. In fact, if you see a buyers agent closing 4 a month, you can be sure her clients are not getting the best job possible. The busiest agent may not be the best agent.  So, get recommendations from friends and family. Look for one person who has a bunch of signs in your desired neighborhood. Go to some open houses. Call some big brokerages and ask for the person on ""floor duty."" Interview several agents and pick the one that fits best with you. A good agent will tell you about local market conditions, talk to you about the buying process, and ask a lot of questions about your needs/wants. In fact, she will want to set up a custom search on the spot with your input. A better agent will have some information for you to take home, such as sample listings, standard disclosures, and a buyers guide.   Good luck!"
RealEstate,3bh31z,ShortWoman,3,Mon Jun 29 06:21:11 2015 UTC,"Good indicator of where I land on the priority list of the agent. If I'm far under their average, he/she won't be as motivated. If I'm far above, then I dunno, maybe it's out of his/her wheelhouse."
RealEstate,3bh31z,Radiobamboo,2,Mon Jun 29 07:02:49 2015 UTC,"You will need to ask them directly. I believe this type of information is only available on the MLS, which you need to be an agent to access. Sorry, you'll have to actually talk to someone... on the phone..."

It also shows 677 agents in my metro area (and only allows a 10-mile radius search), but there are over 2,000 in the board roster. For laughs, I looked at the second agent that came up on the list.  The site shows him having 74 ""current"" listings, with 92 ""historical"".  The actual numbers are 4 and 161."

Given his history he will most likely do it again.  Now I'm American so things may be different over there but you can tell the landlord that he isn't paying his share of the rent/bills and when it comes time to renew your lease, the landlord can refuse to rent to him again.  If you don't want to go that route, MOVE as soon as you receive notice your lease is almost up. If you like the other roommate offer to take them with you."

They had a written agreement about how much the guy was going to pay him, monthly, until the toolbox was paid for. They worked at nearby shops so they saw each other frequently. The guy never made a single payment. My friend would stop by that shop once in a while looking for his friend. The shop owner said, I think he went back to Mexico, but, the toolbox is right there, take it, and quit bothering me. So my friend took his toolbox back.   The guy came back from Mexico, found his tool box gone and filed a police report. My friend was arrested and PROSECUTED for FELONY THEFT (because of the amount). He paid an attorney $10K to get the charge pled down to a misdemeanor so he didn't have a felony conviction on his record.  Some people are dicks. You can't always know who they are.

Company providing moving assistance but it was in the form of ""up to $x,000 per month.""   It was still up to me to find a place to rent.  Based on what I am reading it sounds like you're hoping to partner up with a management company or a specific company that needs the space.  In my experience, being someone who been on both ends of relocating employees and relocating myself, if someone brings their family along they are typically going to be looking for something permanent.   This may not be the case with young children, but if it's only a year assignment or something it seems most people rent an apartment and commute home.  Personally, I'd consider the idea of a lease purchase option.   This might give you solid long term tenants who don't want to walk away from the money they have been paying towards owning the home.  And if they do walk away, that's extra money for you... If not you've held the home for xx years and made a tidy profit."
RealEstate,3bgqn6,caseigl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:56:20 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this advice.   You're probably right that when people move to an area with kids, they're usually in it for the long haul and looking to buy. But not always: sometimes it's a temporary assignment (multinationals like Goldman and Dannon have a lot of those), and the whole family comes along just because. In other cases, people need to sell their existing home before they buy a new one, but want to get their kids into the right school system and can afford the rent.   I want to hold this property for the long term, and likely live it eventually (my kids go to the nearby school). So, the lease purchase option is sort of the opposite of what I need..."
RealEstate,3bgqn6,caseigl,2,Mon Jun 29 03:04:43 2015 UTC,Have you considered a high end vacation rental?  If you go furnished you could rent by the month at a much higher rate and that also leaves open the corporate option as well.  Check out some of the higher end stuff on VRBO and see how you'd compare.
RealEstate,3bgqn6,tleb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:53:26 2015 UTC,"Actually yes! At the risk of being too specific, this home is in the Olympus Cove neighborhood of Salt Lake City, which is about 20--30 minutes from the Cottonwood Canyon ski resorts (Snowbird, Alta, etc.), 30 minutes to Park City, and 10 minutes from downtown SLC. It's pretty much as optimally located as you can get, if your goal is to ""do all Salt Lake City"" for a multi-resort ski vacation. It also has a hot tub and indoor games.    The downside is, this being Salt Lake City, it's not the only vacation rental game in town. I'm not sure I could make enough off of VRBO and AirB&B to make up the added cost. It would likely stay vacant in the summer.   That said, if the current tenants vacate in February, I would consider furnishing it immediately and renting it out during the ski season season and Sundance film festival period."
RealEstate,3bgqn6,tleb,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:08:22 2015 UTC,"I have worked with relocation companies in the past.  If google won't help you find anything local, some phone time with various HR departments might.  You can also approach local Property Management companies (nicer ones, maybe advertising BOMA or IREM certs) when you have a vacancy coming and offer a finders fee for tenants, often a % of total lease value or a higher % of one months rent.  This sort of property is often a smaller niche  in the market and there is a good chance that it won't have competition in their portfolio.  With all that being said, you might want to actually look into a PM for full time management.  For a high rent home you may be able to negotiate a couple points of their normal rate and you get their contacts and experience put towards your benefit.  If you have a cash cow and intend for a long term hold, I would seriously recommend considering this option unless you have experience as a landlord or are willing to put the time in to learn.  Even then you aren't going to have the contacts or weight with the various contractors/repairmen/trades you may need to call on."

I'm always commenting based just on my own experiences. I am a landlord of one townhouse. Real estate is crazy in ""hidden expenses"". I didn't buy a second property until I had my first at $18k left on the mortgage. (And no other debt.) It's a 2/1 in a good urban area. The carrying costs including maintenance and random utilities like pest control and water (and yikes, a property tax increase) usually leave me about $5k a year profit--this is on about $20k a year on rent.  Concentrate on paying off your $40k in debt first. (Paying off a $164k mortgage loan took me 15 years even with extra payments. Maintenance, upgrades and job changes happen.)

RealEstate,3bggea,od_9,4,Mon Jun 29 03:52:54 2015 UTC,"The difference is that if you get the place now with an interest only loan and rates go up, in 5 years you might find you can't afford the mortgage. Interest rates going up would also lead to a decline in house values, so the 20% equity you would have now might not be 20% in the future, which could make refinancing hard.   If you wait, you can't get stuck in a situation you might have a hard time getting out of. If you hold off, you might find yourself in a much better situation. Interest only isn't really much better than renting from an equity standpoint if the property value stays the same, is good if the value goes up, but really bad if the value goes down."
RealEstate,3bggea,od_9,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:25:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks, makes sense.  My dilemma is we KNOW we dont want to be in our current house forever and we KNOW we want the other neighborhood.

But you're saying you can't afford the new place now.  What I'm saying is that if you can't afford the place, you shouldn't buy it. And if you can only afford an interest only payment, then I don't think you can afford the place. You're basing your decision on believing the value of the place is going to go up in the near term (next 5 years), if it does you're fine, but if it doesn't, if it stays the same or declines, then you've got a big problem in 5 years time. You probably won't end up under water, but you might end up not having the equity you need to refinance.  Interest only only makes sense to me if you're dealing with a short them flip.

And the decision is based on what were saving towards (that area) and if i can get in now with 20% down, spend the same 5 years saving we would have needed to anyway, is it really that risky?

RealEstate,3bggea,nofishies,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:27:24 2015 UTC,"If the assumption is that values are going to continue to rise then of course you should buy of you can afford it. But I'm not sure that assumption is valid. I'm also confused because you say an interest only loan would be cheaper than your current mortgage, which I'm assuming you can afford. Would other expenses increase with the new place? Is that why you wouldn't be able to afford a similar priced mortgage? I'm assuming property taxes are included in your expense calculations."
RealEstate,3bggea,13yearsofage,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:39:42 2015 UTC,"Im currently in a standard 30 years fixed, plus a townhome with a high HOA.  So current mortgage + HOA is more than the monthly for the interest only + HOA.    The reason for my thinking was were still saving $X per month in the new loan like we are now.  So after 5 years we'd still have $X x 60 months in savings, which would give us enough to re-fi and get the mortgage balance to the same we have to pay off now in current place.    So basically - even if home values stay exactly the same we're back to exactly where we are now (assuming no job catastrophes, etc), only we're in the place.    And of course, if it does go up in equity it only helps."

I close the loan to them, in their name, and 5 seconds after closing my clients put the property in the LLC for whatever reason. Lender still has the debt secured by the home, meaning the property is still vulnerable to foreclosure in the event that the mortgage isn't paid. Later when they want to buy their next property, it's not an issue provided their taxes aren't wonky.   Lenders don't care about whether it saves taxes (and an LLC doesn't).   We sure as shit care when by the time Mr CPA is done, tax returns show them making nothing or losing money even though all the bank statements, and everything else, tell a different story.

RealEstate,3bfo7q,LotsOfWatts,2,Mon Jun 29 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"It is a good idea for each property to be owned by it's own LLC (or corporation).  This way, if there is a slip and fall on one property, the liability will be limited to that property.  Same goes if you have only one property.  The liability will be limited to that property and not to you personally.  There are a slew of details that can change the rules but this is generally the safest way to own property, liability speaking."
RealEstate,3bfo7q,BenFloppi,4,Sun Jun 28 22:24:09 2015 UTC,"No it's not,  here's why:  First, your primary protection from this kind of incident is your owners liability instance policy.  If that were to not cover it for some reason the person would probably have to sue the LLC- here's the problem though- the managers in the LLC are liable for their actions. This means that if you have an LLC and you are the only member- you are responsible and liable for all of the LLC's actions.  However LLC's do protect non managing members.  If you owned part of an LLC and someone else was the manager and managing the companies actions- the manager could be liable as well as the LLC- however your liability as strictly a part owner of the LLC would be limited to your assets in the LLC meaning the person could only go after anything you have in the LLC.  In otherwords LLCs protect investors from personal liability but not liability from the actions of its managers."
RealEstate,3bfo7q,adrewishprince,5,Sun Jun 28 20:56:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure about the laws where you live but in NY and NJ the managing member is shielded by the corporate veil.  So long as you follow all the rules of a corporation, the court is almost never going to pierce the veil.  For example, in a single member LLC, even if you owned the property outright and there was no liability insurance, so long as you follow the corporate structure (separate bank accounts,  etc.), the liability would be limited to the assets of the company.  The manager would only be personally liable if the corporation was used to perpetuate or commit a crime or some other veil piercing event."
RealEstate,3bfo7q,BenFloppi,2,Sun Jun 28 21:56:54 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  My property isn't in NJ but I know NJ requires those managing the property to be working under a broker unless you are the owner.  Does having the property in an LLC make the LLC the owner and thus, management of the property by you (the individual) illegal unless you are also a RE Agent?"
RealEstate,3bfo7q,minze,0,Mon Jun 29 15:32:26 2015 UTC,Having the property in the LLC's name does make the LLC the owner.  There are different scenarios I can come up with that would make it perfectly legal and some that would make it illegal to manage the property.  Your best bet would be to call the local licensing agency (Dept. of Banking and Insurance in NJ / Dept. of State in NY) and tell them your specific set of circumstances and get their opinion.
RealEstate,3bfo7q,BenFloppi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"I am interested in some of those scenarios.  I thought that the transition to LLC included the transfer of title from your personal name to the LLC entity, thus making the LLC the ""owner"" of the property and providing the individual with the LLC benefits.  If the individual is the owner then, unless they are using the LLC for management of the property (which would bring in the same issue) there wouldn't be the liability protections.  I can easily be mising something and I know that there are creative ways to use an LLC.  I'm always interested in new ways to operate."

You can get credit cards in the LLC's name that don't show up on your personal credit report. You have to use your social to get the card and you'll be personally liable, but the line doesn't show up on your credit report and won't affect your DTI."
RealEstate,3bfo7q,tonguepunch,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:33:09 2015 UTC,One aspect of this conversation that is often neglected.

RealEstate,3bfo7q,GringoGrande,0,Mon Jun 29 11:23:37 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind too, for most people the LLC doesn't make enough money to acquire property or to obtain financing. So, most people purchase the property based on their individual earnings and borrowing capacity, and the mortgage debt remains personal as opposed to LLC debt... this is problematic if you're trying to mitigate personal liability risk."
RealEstate,3bfo7q,LotsOfWatts,2,Sun Jun 28 23:46:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the lender was probably going to make every effort to have individual be personally liable anyway. An LLC in this context is going to have an uphill battle protecting the owner from the mtg debt it's the unforeseen risks the LLC may help with. As many have noted, insurance may be the better approach for those anyway."

A real estate attorney is the best guy for the job, but a lot of agents would be happy to take a few hundred bucks to just shepherd some paper through the system.   I recommend strongly that you insist your tenant get their own mortgage. Resist the temptation to do any sort of owner financing, ""tote the note"", ""rent to own"" or similar arrangement! The last thing in the world you want is for this property to come back to you months or years from now, since it will likely need much work to be rentable or salable again.

RealEstate,3bf0eg,wamazing,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:25:36 2015 UTC,"Did you get an appraisal? What did the appraiser say it was?   Houses are measured on the exterior. You aren't going to get a good measurement by adding up rooms. Measure the exterior, draw it out on graph paper. Once you've got it drawn (to scale) divide up the area into easy to calculate squares or rectangles, and add up the figures.   Don't count patios or garage or any space not accessible from the interior of the house.   Generally 10% is a common rule for a ""material"" difference but this can vary depending on the size and style of the house.   There probably isn't anything you can do about it because everything about buying a house is for advertising purposes only, and it's on you to do your due diligence and verify anything important to you.

RealEstate,3bdgpj,mingfisher,3,Sun Jun 28 17:33:41 2015 UTC,"IMO, yes you could ask the window to be replaced. If the seller refuses, then that would be a valid reason to back out. Your contract probably says seller will deliver house in the same condition etc, so, they're responsible for anything that breaks or is damaged before closing.   But if you're more concerned about the area, that is not a valid reason to back out, because your 'due diligence' period is over. You would be the one in breach of contract, not the seller (assuming they are agreeable to fixing the window).   Good luck."
RealEstate,3bdgpj,wamazing,2,Sun Jun 28 14:10:27 2015 UTC,Thanks! Yeah that was what I wanted to know. If they refuse to fix the damage would that be reason enough to be able to back out.   I'm going to assess the damage today and see how this plays out.
RealEstate,3bdgpj,a1reddit,0,Sun Jun 28 17:27:46 2015 UTC,Don't you have contingencies? An inspection contingency or finance contingency should get you out.
RealEstate,3bdgpj,wamazing,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:58:23 2015 UTC,"If they are a few days away from closing, you have to assume the inspection period is over. And a bullet hole is not a reason to deny financing, that's a simple repair. Even FHA lets you get away with one broken window.   But the contract probably states seller will deliver the place in the same condition, so, if they refuse to fix the window, OP might have an out."
RealEstate,3bdgpj,wamazing,2,Sun Jun 28 14:12:01 2015 UTC,"Right. I just want to know if the seller refusing to fix the damage would be enough to back out.   The area itself is fine.

They did not read my little ""10 things to do and not do"" flier that I give everyone the second they walk in my door and like 3 additional times throughout the process, clearly.  Sears can in fact fax you (give them your loan officer's fax number as 'your' fax number) a statement showing your current balance and what the monthly payment will be. You, however, need to stomp your feet, raise hell, ask to speak to management, yell, be a pain in the ass, make everyone's life miserable, and generally do whatever it takes.  Your house is on the line, buddy.  The family I mentioned in the first sentence did close, and close on time, by the way. Because sufficient hell was raised, I got the fax ASAP, and we got the credit supplement done.  Monday, 10:30 AM. That is the deadline I am giving you to have any chance of closing on time to have that fax over to your loan officer, as well as the full account number, so they can get the credit supplement going.   One caveat I will add is that if you shopped around for the lender with the cheapest closing costs, you may be screwed and lose your home if the sellers are unwilling to push the time back. If you went with the lender your Realtor sent you to, then you may still close on time."

One, you went with a lender you already know to be in the top 15% b/c a Realtor referred you - Realtors work with dozen's of lenders, but typically only send business to one or two. Doing everything possible to close this on time is where this lender is earning his place on that short list.   Second, renovation lenders also tend to be very good.   We did a three-way conference call with AMEX regarding a question that the lender had.    Good!    Do you think the same thing would potentially satisfy this situation?

Every transaction is different, and it isn't realistic to claim that I or anyone else can come up with one list that is 100% applicable to every situation.

RealEstate,3bc0g3,masterudia,3,Mon Jun 29 01:48:49 2015 UTC,"Don't do that either. Closing the account might hurt your credit score. Before going down that route, ask you LO what the underwriter will accept as proof. Sometimes a Letter of Explanation will work. If no proof other than the statement will suffice, maybe they can assess you at a higher DTI by taking 10% of the credit line amount and hitting you with whatever payment that would be. Was financing tight for you qualifying in regards to your income? Make sure you get it cleared up before like noon on Tuesday or the docs will be late to escrow. Good luck."
RealEstate,3bdg75,dbzillion,7,Sun Jun 28 04:24:06 2015 UTC,"One of the (if not THE) most important thing in an appraisal is a complete analysis of the highest and best use of any property. For typical residential appraisals of a house in a subdivision, this is a no-brainer because you're limited by zoning and, most houses just sell to someone who wants a house and that's that. So a lot of residential appraisers don't really know how to do this, and, when confronted with your house, will fail at it.   To attempt to value this place (which I am not doing, just giving you some background info...) the first thing you need to determine is what is the HBU, and who is a likely buyer?   Are you conducting commercial activities here, baking things and selling them? If so, is that legal in your area? That kind of stuff is heavily regulated in my neck of the woods. I have a friend who makes and sells wedding cakes and she cannot bake at home, she has to do her baking at a licensed commissary (but I think she can take them home to decorate them).   Or is this just a big (commercial quality) hobby kitchen for you?   Depending on that answer you might have a different HBU and a different buyer pool.   When you say you're ""in the woods"" those kind of places (at least around here) might be able to get a variance or even change the zoning so that commercial activities are legal. In most markets this is going to bring the most dollars.   If it's not legal, or can't be made legal for commercial purposes, now you've just got a residential property with an overimprovement which is pretty easy to value. And I hope you're sitting down because in the eyes of a lender that kitchen is probably worth nothing. The fact that no other (residential) comps have sold with this type of setup tells them there is no demand for this feature in the market, therefore, it's (basically) worth nothing to your appraisal. This is because appraising is heavily regulated for GSE loans. I can't say ""I think it's worth X"" I have to prove it. I can only prove it, with comps. Portfolio lenders might have a different view but, seriously doubt you're going to even get 10 cents on the dollar for what you've invested there, as part of a residential sale.   Second kitchens are also a big red flag for many lenders because they are an indication that you're renting out the basement to a tenant, and so perhaps you're running an illegal 2-family here. Obviously you're not but, I'm just telling you when the report goes up the QC chain someone will run across a checkbox that says, ""2nd kitchen Y/N"" and checking yes means no loan. I have never appraised a place with a second kitchen but in some markets ""kosher kitchens"" are common, which is a 2nd kitchen that's used for prepping religious meals. These folks can have a heck of a time financing these. I've even heard of people removing all the kitchen equipment temporarily in order to get the loan, then reinstalling it after they refi. Obviously not a solution on a sale and you're not getting any added value for it.   IMO the only way you are going to get any money for that is to sell the equipment itself as personal property before you sell the house, or convert to a legal commercial kitchen and find a buyer who can get a commercial loan. You still might not get a ton of extra money for it, because commercial loans are more expensive and fewer buyers will qualify for them (you need a serious down payment).  Houses are houses. Stuff is stuff. Used stuff is not usually worth much. Adding a bunch of stuff to a house does not help the value of a house because people want a house not your stuff. And lenders don't want to lend on stuff, only on houses."

RealEstate,3bdg75,wamazing,4,Sun Jun 28 15:01:24 2015 UTC,"OK then great, you need a commercial realtor, a commercial buyer, and a commercial appraiser.

It's a great way to find people who are looking for a house but don't have an agent.   So the experienced agents are doing them because the sellers expect it, and hey, it's just 2 hours. The newer agents are still trying to build up a client base so they are there all weekend. Why not what else do they have to do?   It's common here for some of the big-time agents to do an all-day open house, but they aren't actually there, they send an assistant or newer agent. They might pop in at the start as the homeowners are leaving because this sellers expect this but they're not sitting around all day here."
RealEstate,3bdmwz,wamazing,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:03:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks.  The experienced agents also ask for staging.  I was wondering why stage for a 2 hour showing but I guess the staging benefits from private tours afterwards as well.  What about the opportunity the seller agent gets to talk directly with a buyer?  The selling agent probably knows more about the property and the area than the buyer's agent, who needs to go everywhere vs focus energy and research on a handful?"
RealEstate,3bdmwz,wamazing,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:05:11 2015 UTC,"This is really a market-specific question. In some areas, and depending on the market segment, staging can be pretty powerful. If an experienced agent is recommending something, I'd be inclined to think they know what they are talking about.   And busy agents who have lots of clients really don't care about talking to potential buyers, because most of them probably already have agents. In a slow market, sure, agents will do all kinds of open houses, but if it's busy, they'll farm them out to assistants."
RealEstate,3bdmwz,loki8481,3,Tue Jun 30 00:40:37 2015 UTC,"not a real estate agent, but fwiw based on my experiences as a buyer... 99% of open houses in my region are Sunday, 1 pm - 4 pm."
RealEstate,3bdmwz,Lusitania_420,2,Sun Jun 28 15:41:28 2015 UTC,"There are 2 reasons agents hold open houses. 1 to expose your property to potential new clients. 2 it's a great way to meet new buyers. In my state we can't prospect a new client at any open houses. I would not so much look at how long they hold open houses. I would be asking questions like. How many houses have you sold in the past year, average days on the market. What kind of marketing do they do. Ask them to see their listing packet. Good luck!"

RealEstate,3bdmwz,aardy,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:42:17 2015 UTC,"I don't want to find out. Lol. I had what seemed like a ""secret shopper"" at one of my open houses. He was asking inappropriate questions about race and ethnicity of the neighborhood. Then he asked me about other houses he was looking at. Which I stated that I would love to help him, but I am here to represent this property today. Asked him if he was being contractually represented by an agent, he mumbled something about one in California. Talked to my lawyer to also make sure I didn't say anything. I was good. If you are found violating this in my state you could loose your license be fined. Scary stuff I don't involve myself with."
RealEstate,3bc7oo,heavy_sandvich,7,Sat Jun 27 20:56:38 2015 UTC,"Nah I don't think it's a bad sign at all. In fact it's a good sign when development is happening around you.   You will get the NIMBY crowd, fine, let them whine about it and sell if they want.   The apartments are not competition for your house when you sell. If they had built houses there instead, that would be competition and possibly impact your price negatively, because you just put a bunch more supply of houses on the market. But even if they had built houses, developers tend to price at the top of the market so any negative impact would be temporary and minor (at least, this is usually the case in my market but, every market really could be different).   Builders wouldn't be moving in if they didn't see profits there. You will very likely benefit from this over time. I wouldn't sweat it."
RealEstate,3bc7oo,wamazing,3,Sat Jun 27 21:08:17 2015 UTC,"There are houses going up just north of the apartments, but the demand is so damn high right now in Austin I didn't think it would impact us too negatively.  Thanks for the reply.  I needed that broader perspective.  Relieved you think it's a positive."
RealEstate,3bc7oo,joonix,5,Sat Jun 27 21:18:14 2015 UTC,No. People who think density reduces land value are idiots. Do they think rural Kansas land is more valuable than Manhattan too?
RealEstate,3bc7oo,ShortWoman,6,Sun Jun 28 15:56:10 2015 UTC,"Let's say there's 200 units going in over there. According to what I'm reading, most of the multifamily being developed is high end. So instead of 200 individual houses with 200 individual owners (some of whom may actually be landlords), you have one landlord with the authority to evict troublemakers. From a crime standpoint, I'd rather have well-managed apartments across the street.  Now lets talk traffic. Chances are that those units will be mostly 1 and 2 bedrooms, maybe some 3s. If they were building 200 houses, they'd be mostly 3-4 bedroom. More bedrooms means more people means more traffic. Again, point to the apartments.   Privacy? Not sure what the argument is. ""Apartment people are a bunch of perverts who will look in your windows?"" I think your neighbors have more to worry about from morons with drones and cell phone cameras.  There's also what wamazing said about competition when you sell.  So maybe I'm biased because I never understood what House People had against Apartment People. I just don't see why it's a problem."
RealEstate,3bc7oo,FlyingBasset,3,Sat Jun 27 21:50:39 2015 UTC,"1) You are assuming heavily on the crime standpoint. The majority of homes are owner-occupied, not rented. And in general people who own their property tend to be better neighbors IME.  2) Apartments are much higher in population density... that's why they exist. I just moved from an apartment/condo with over 1000 residents to a townhouse neighborhood that is 3 times the square footage with maybe 200-300 people total. Apartments absolutely WILL increase traffic in the area. Whether it is a problem is dependent on the area.  3) If you have a multiple story apartment building across the street from your house people will be able to easily see into your windows and backyard and these are all people you don't know. Are people intentionally looking in your windows? Probably not. Does 100 strangers being able to see into your bedroom and backyard affect privacy? Of course.  Considering I was an apartment person up until a week ago I don't think I'm biased. I am NOT saying this is a bad change for OP. Just pointing out some basic stuff."

If they were building 200 houses, they'd be mostly 3-4 bedroom. More bedrooms means more people means more traffic. Again, point to the apartments.    You're not going to build 200 apartments where 200 houses would fit. The reality is the apartments are likely much denser housing than single family homes.  Otherwise I agree with your post!"

In the short term, Austin is hot, south Austin is doubly hot, and I don't expect your property values to take a serious dive. If everyone's selling, it might just because they're moving.   In the long term: low-rent apartments hurt schools. Especially in Texas, where there's no school choice and the local elementary school is the main determining factor of your neighborhood's socioeconomic class. One reason I left Austin was that the guy who lived 1/4 mile across the street snubbed me for living in the ""rabble"" neighborhood. The main difference? Mine had a few apartments and the ""trouble"" schools, theirs had no apartments and schools with 10's, perfect for tiger parents and trophy wives.   In other places with school choice, such as Utah, this is much less of an issue... but in Texas you have a right to at least be wary."

They are almost assuredly not adding anything to your investments that you couldn't get via Betterment or a Lazy Portfolio strategy.  I would liquidate your company's stock plan.  You're disproportionately tilted towards your employer, which is a sure fire way to fail if you find your company failing and you out of a job.

Your last sentence, about not buying a place while I'm renting--is it really as black and white as that? I don't see myself buying a place to live in myself for at least 3-5 years, is there really no way that getting into real estate as an investment makes sense until then?

Anyway, I stumbled onto countless squatters, a few people in the middle of shooting up, scrappers in the middle of cutting out copper, and alot of live animals that got trapped in the house when it was boarded up (cats,squirrels,etc).  The scariest by far was when the drug dealing next door neighbor was storing his pitbulls in a house I had just bought.  I opened the door, took 2 steps inside, and 3 pitbulls, bread to fight and protect his stash, came running down the stairs at me.

I finally got her to leave by pulling out my phone ready to call someone.    I followed her to the door, shut and locked it.  I watched through the blinds as she went to the vacant house and stood staring at it until two guys came walking out and she started pointing at the house I was in.  I left.  Did not care about anything other than getting in my car and getting the hell anywhere else.  I've never done an open house since and just won't.  Up until then I did them all the time.  I did not know it at the time, it was a very bad area.  The agent that asked me to hold it open had torn down an old house and put a new one in it's place.  He did not give me any indication that I should even have someone come with me.  Was a pretty shitty thing for him to do.

Wanted rural, vacant homes. I kind of blew him off and he persisted. Most buyers will move on if they aren't getting attention immediately - they aren't that loyal. This guy was too loyal, and very persistent. Then came into our office one day when I wasn't in there. Secretary called me and I asked her to move to a place she could talk. Said they were two very large men, acting very nervous. I asked her to give one of them the phone. I told them as soon as they brought in a pre-approval letter or proof of funds I'd help them. Never heard from them again.  Called the ""referring agent"" and of course she said, ""Why would I do that? I don't know you."" So I described the situation and she said, ""OMG those guys came to our office, and were acting SO strangely that the two of us who were in the office were scared, and called a couple of male agents to come to the office quickly. As soon as the first guy showed up, they left without saying anything. And they didn't have a car parked nearby, they left on foot."" She also said she looked into his background (he said he was from another state) and he had a wife in that other state, but never mentioned the wife when he talked to either of us. I can't remember all of the background details she found out, but nothing was adding up with his story. People check us out online, and we check out potential clients too.  Always trust your gut! And if something like that happens, call the Board so they can send out an alert. And don't do blind showings, no mater how badly you need a sale. And always have some kind of defense with you (and know how to use it) - whether it's a firearm, self-defense training, bear mace (better than regular mace), and/or another agent to help you. Never park so you can be blocked in, never go in first, always  stay in the home where you can escape, always let someone know where you are who will check on you while you are there.

My best story was while viewing a property, a local citizen (assuming on drugs) started waking in circles around my car, singing/yelling 'run, better run' for about 15 - 20 minutes. I waited him out and proceeded to hit the road. Just remember, people are weird, and situational awareness is your best bet.   I'm a huge supporter of concealed carry, and always carry a firearm.

RealEstate,3ba6e6,Poopdookie,2,Sun Jun 28 02:00:00 2015 UTC,"Not really scary but interesting enough to share. I am not a writer so please excuse my grammar mistakes.    This was a while back when I was 24 and used to show apartments in Boston. It was close to the intersection of Quincy st and Harvard. It was around 10:30am as I pulled up next to the convenience store and I parked facing incoming traffic. The people looking at the apartment were running late so I decided to get something to drink. Soon after I step into the store a woman runs in screaming ""OMG someone just broke that car window!!"" Right when she said it I remembered I forgot to remove my Iphone 3 from the window. I run outside and confirm it's my car. At this moment I am in shock. The woman who witnessed it happen told me the guy who held the door open for me as I entered the store ran to my car punched the window. Stole my iphone and my backpack which had my macbook pro and a digital camera in it. Then jumped in his friends car who was waiting for him a couple of spots back. She gave me a description of the guy, the car, and a part of the license plate number. I'm still in shock and get into my car to try to speed in the direction she tole me they went. In the 60 seconds that this all took place I come to my senses, turn the car around and park back where I was and call the police. I go into the store and ask the guy to see his security cameras. Naturally he says they are broken. I don't believe him but I don't push it because I know he's just looking out for himself. The police come and for the first few minutes they're not buying my story. They didn't say it but I felt as if they thought I wasn't being straight with them especially because when I parked my car after trying to chase them I parked it crooked. They must have thought it was a drug deal gone bad.   They came into the store with me and started asking the witness for more information. I noticed the guy had a computer and I asked to use it. I remembered I had the find my iphone app enabled. I log in and try to ping my phone. It took another few minutes to explain to the cops what find my iphone is and that my phone was on the corner of Wyola Pl and Columbia Rd. What I did do unintentionally was send the default message to my iphone letting them know my phone had been located. They tell me to wait here and they'll go check out the location. It turns out the thieves pulled into the mechanic shop right by Wyola Pl probably to try to sell my stuff. When the cops were heading to that direction they had they're sirens on they thought they've been caught because of the iphone message. The stopped the car left it with all the doors open and started running. Now the police had no idea that was them until they noticed a bunch of guys running out of a car in the parking lot of the mechanic shop. They chased them on foot and caught one of them due to him being really fat. Apparently they guy tried running but realized he wasn't going to out run them and gave up. I got my backpack back and they found my phone in the bushes on the corner of Wyola and Columbia. I never followed up with the prosecutor when it came to the guys court date. They asked me to come in and testify but unfortunately at that time I had been diagnosed with cancer and just didn't give a fuck."

I view 3.5% down with a FHA loan on a 500k property as ""I don't really have the money to buy this thing"" and as such, there is a risk you won't make it to closing.  How much money are you going to put in earnest?  As I said, I'd frown on a 3.5% and a FHA loan in the market especially with a ~500k purchase price. If this is a hot market with competition I would expect to see offers that look much sound financially.

RealEstate,3bb65b,squishykins,3,Sat Jun 27 20:46:22 2015 UTC,"I work for a builder and am currently improving this exact process at my company! Things may be different because the community you're looking at is more popular... they can ""tell you"" the price because they don't have to accept lower offers. You can't quite make an offer like you would on a completed home because as of right now you don't know what will be in the home yet.  At my company the way things work is that you go under contract for a specific floor plan on a specific lot for a given base price. You usually pick your structural options (foundation, exterior style, etc) either at contract or shortly after because they can't start on the construction plans until you lock that in. This is the time you should include any incentives like closing cost assistance or a design allowance (free upgrades). Be sure to ask for a copy of the neighborhood standards so that you understand and budget for the upgrades you are likely to choose!  Then you typically go through a design selection process, where you pick your interior options like countertops and flooring. You will have the choice of whatever is included in the base price (maybe carpet in bedrooms and hardwood everywhere else) or you can upgrade to hardwoods everywhere for a price. You will create an addendum to your original contract that specifies which upgrades you are choosing and how much they add to the sale price. You may need to provide an additional deposit at the time you execute that design addendum.  All that said, I am concerned that they are promising an October/November closing date if they haven't broken ground yet. At my company it would take about a month longer, but perhaps this builder has a shorter cycle time. If that date is important to you, ask to speak to the production or construction manager to confirm that it's realistic. Sometimes sales agents have bad info!"

Surely the last decade has taught us all that you cannot count on property values rising.    I'm not ready to start with properties I have to subsidize every month.   Here is the beginning of wisdom.    Aside from the hazards of investing at a long distance, I am not enamored with the idea of paying retail price for a property. Still, if it cash flows, it seems like it may not be a terrible option.   The hazards of long distance investing are many, and they extend far beyond paying 7-10% of revs for your PM.   As for paying retail, I think you'll find that if a property is truly ""turn key,"" you'll have no choice but to pay retail. The simple truth is that if the current owner can get full price, they are unlikely to sell to you or anyone else at a discount. Discounts reflect something wrong: repairs that must be done, the hassle of a short sale, etc.. A quality investor provides value (and makes profit) by fixing the things that are wrong.

You can get a heads up on what might be coming available, but it is rare for a bank to entertain an offer until they have done all of their due diligence and list the property for sale.  Also, depending on the redemption period and so forth, you aren't going to be able to get it as soon as they have it anyway, there are a myriad of laws regulating when the bank can even do preservation on a property, much less list it, depending on your jurisdiction.  That being said, sometimes the smaller local banks that have properties may entertain something like that, but that is probably your only shot."
RealEstate,3b8ekm,Fuddit,32,Fri Jun 26 20:19:12 2015 UTC,"None of those look like BS fees to me. They all look like required things when you buy a house (if you get a loan anyway).   And a $600 origination charge is low, IME.   The appraiser is probably only getting half that fee, the lender or AMC is keeping the other half (which is a big reason you might get a shitty appraisal, because only the stupid ones work for $250).   But sure, you can shop around for most of the other things. Research companies carefully, though, in many ways that maxim about getting what you pay for, is true."
RealEstate,3b8ekm,wamazing,12,Fri Jun 26 22:36:28 2015 UTC,Nobody wants to pay for anything.
RealEstate,3b8ekm,miketeeeveee,3,Fri Jun 26 23:37:42 2015 UTC,"Alright,  thanks."
RealEstate,3b8ekm,midnitewarrior,11,Sat Jun 27 00:49:31 2015 UTC,"1 - The ""Origination Fee"" is the fee your broker or issuing bank charges you for their services.  You can ask the person writing your loan for a discount, but you likely won't get them to budge unless it is a competitive situation.  If you want this to be cheap, get a loan from a credit union.  Mine was $250 from a credit union.  2 - Appraisal Fee - Bank sends someone to your home to assess its value and to reassure the bank that this property is worth the loan you are seeking.  Seems a bit high, but the bank usually picks the appraiser.  3 - Credit Report - you have to have one.  They could waive this, but honestly, are you going to take them to task for a $13 charge?  4 & 5 - You should be able to shop around for the Title Insurance.  Check with Title Forward for cheaper Title Insurance.  6 - You can hire your own survey firm.  May be able to get a lower price for this.  If you know who issued the previous survey, it is much less work for them to update their last survey than make a new one, may save some money.  7 & 8 - Certainties of life, death, taxes and fees. No getting out of this.  9 - Escrow account deposit - this is your money held by others to pay your anticipated property taxes.  If the taxes are less, you will get to keep your money.  10 - Daily Interest Charges - you only pay interest (no principal portion) from the time you close the loan to your first ""official"" payment, which is usually sometime after 30 days.  This is the interest for that period of time.  The only ways to change this are to close on another day, or get a loan that has a lower interest rate.  11 - This is your homeowner's insurance.  Shop around for better insurance if you don't like how much this costs.  My concern is that if you don't understand these things, you are probably very new to the home buying process.  I'm wondering if you have a competitive interest rate.  What's your credit score / general location / amount of loan / down payment / interest rate?  The biggest cost of any home purchase is typically the interest you will pay on the loan.  1/4 of a percent lower interest rate can save you thousands of dollars."

RealEstate,3b8ekm,dorkella,2,Fri Jun 26 22:05:43 2015 UTC,The transfer tax is exactly what it says. It's the tax you pay to your State when transferring property from one owner to the other.

RealEstate,3b8ekm,Tictacforyourthought,2,Sat Jun 27 14:52:12 2015 UTC,2 & 3 are not outrageous.  9 varies with which day of the month you close on: later in month = lower cost

Essentially, they are collecting an amount appropriate from you each month in order to pay certain things in relation to your home.

When these two become due, you won't be responsible for them out of pocket - your lender will pay them on your behalf out of your Escrow account.   Hope this helps!"

RealEstate,3b8ekm,PHARMDRX,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:54:57 2015 UTC,"Escrow refers to the extra fees involved with homeownership.   Your mortgage payment will consist of various parts: Principal and Interest (the actual payment for the loan and interest), possibly private mortgage insurance depending on your loan type, and escrow.  Escrow refers to the amounts you will pay in each month that go toward your property taxes and homeowners insurance. Essentially, you will be putting money in an account every month that will be used to pay for a year of property taxes and homeowners insurance when they are due. The escrow amount will likely go up each year as your taxes and homeowners insurance go up."

Don't feel bad for asking them questions,  they are going to walk away with a great paycheck.  If they say ""talk to the lender"", then talk to the lender.  They,  too, make a good paycheck.    It is these people's jobs to inform you.  If you're agent is always in a hurry and not able to sit down to go over stuff with you,  FIND A NEW AGENT.  Make sure they go through the first offer you write line by line with you,  so they can define anything you aren't familiar with.  And never be afraid to get a second opinion."

Real estate is complicated,  not being familiar with every term or required fee isn't a sin.  Doesn't mean his money is any less green or that he isn't worthy of home ownership.

Lots of kids and young people get a big check when a parent passes away. Often the first thing they spend money on is a new place to live. Bad credit makes it difficult to rent. But lump sum payments negate the need to worry about credit.

RealEstate,3b9ccg,Melans,5,Sat Jun 27 02:42:45 2015 UTC,"I think it completely depends on renter, whoever mentioned look at whole package is smart. I sold my house several months back, and thus had a huge amount of cash (yay equity). I only asked for discount for pure reasons and that was for a discount. We asked many places about it as we looked around, turns out its so common in my town for people to do this- either no discount offerred or no advanced rent taken. I was really surprised. However, I was later told this is a bad plan from the renters perspective cause if you have a problem the landlord may not be motivated to fix it, further should they have money problems - getting my money back could be an issue. So I would not say red flags exactly, but unless there are so more know factors it can cause issues on both sides."
RealEstate,3b9ccg,GringoGrande,10,Sat Jun 27 02:48:38 2015 UTC,"I'm going to put an alternate point of view.  First of all, as a landlord let me say I would not accept this arrangement. However for the sake of discussion let's say they are on the up and up. In that case they are being smart.  Buying note partials or future rent from Landlords is a way to get fantastic returns.   Example: Dave is looking for 10k to do a deal.  Dave has a free and clear house that nets $1000 a month. I give Dave 10k in exchange for one years worth of rent. Dave takes his 10k and does his deal. I get 12k back on my 10k. That is 20% return in one year. Not too bad.  So perhaps your tenant is financially savvy. If your tenant would normally pay $1000 a month in rent but you agree to take $10,800 up front ($900 a month x 12) then they have created a nice little discount for themselves...10% a month."
RealEstate,3b9ccg,farmerfoo,2,Sat Jun 27 10:19:36 2015 UTC,That's a huge discount to give. It's not smart to give a 10% discount on rent.
RealEstate,3b9ccg,MightyTaint,7,Sat Jun 27 01:38:03 2015 UTC,Unless you have some other investment in mind that will return more than the discount you'll be offering.
RealEstate,3b9ccg,GringoGrande,2,Sat Jun 27 02:44:19 2015 UTC,"/u/MightyTaint gets it. /u/farmerfoo a great lesson I learned as an investor...because I used to think that way too...is that price and money are immaterial in real estate investing.  What I mean by this is someone isn't selling a home because they want all cash. They are selling the home because they want the cash to get something they want more.  Wrap your head around this concept and it opens up a whole new world as an investor.  Every single property I've ever purchased has been with seller financed terms. I find out what they really want, explain I can give them they money they require to get what they want and point out that if they will finance me the rest, I'll give them a better return than their bank ever did.  Same things with houses. I'll sell or trade any of my properties if it means getting a property I like better.  So let's do the math here.  OP finds a property he can buy for 10k down but he's a little short. Tenant offers him a years worth of rent at a 10% discount: $10,800.  OP could now go buy a second property...let's assume it cash flows $300 a month. OP now has the long term equity of two properties and and the $300 a month from the new property means he is still net positive $200 a month over the income derived from the old property on its own even at a discount.  This is of course a highly simplified example for the sake over conversation."
RealEstate,3b9ccg,farmerfoo,3,Sat Jun 27 05:11:36 2015 UTC,"I get the concept after I thought about it a little more. Re investing is a side thing to my main business so i haven't thought of that as a possibility to finance properties. I get it now. I set up my properties and run them  in a way that I still wouldn't want to do that, but I get the appeal to investors who don't mind having a marginal equity stake in their properties to be able to acquire more. You just gotta make sure you have a relatively safe return on the investment to meet the obligations of the original property. What I've learned in re is that I sleep well at night having fat cash reserves and decent equity. I consider using future income to finance another investment inorganic growth and too risky for me."

I have seen people with no credit (from overseas, so no US credit history) or bad credit who have cash (sold house, for example ) who want to prepay a year to get their application accepted.   Seems like a good plan except I think you as a landlord could run into trouble with the security deposit laws.

RealEstate,3b7wu6,German_Mafia,6,Fri Jun 26 19:41:59 2015 UTC,"Depends on state and amount really.  In my state (and at the firm I practice) we are bonded for theft/misappropriation etc.  All deposits are held in a trust account audited by the state.  Nothing is released until all involved parties sign off on it.  In the event of a dispute, its held until a judge directs us.  If it is not disputed, nor directed for some time period (I forget honestly, I think its a couple years) it is turned over to the state to hold for safety.  On top of that, the state maintains a recovery fund that will reimburse you if we fuck up with your money as a licensee.    I'm sure there are limited to all that.   If you are wanting to escrow a couple million bucks for deal I'd probably tell you to talk to your attorney about the best place to escrow it (we probably wouldn't even want to hold that much).  For a house like op is talking about?  Pfft its doubled bonded and gov audited.  I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it.    Honestly I've seen far more cases of attorneys fucking with their trust accounts than brokers.   Again though I'm assuming a typical house type escrow.  I'd say once you go over 250k this is worth discussing more.  a few grand though (assuming OP's state works like mine) is pretty safe with a broker."

My broker may only have $10k in their acct, which would be used to fund deposits on any of the 100 deals that were being negotiated and accepted.  As deals were accepted, that actual deposit is allocated to that deal.  So I may be representing $100k in deposits, while only $10k is backing it up.  Obviously 100 deals would never be accepted at once, so all was good in the world.  Once the conveyor belt is set up, money is constantly going in and going out.

Keep in mind unless stated otherwise in your contract, earnest funds do not denote any specific damages or remedies.  Actual damages may exceed or be less than these (as noted, unless your contract states otherwise).  The purpose of earnest funds is to bond these potential damages the seller may face so they don't have to chase you down for them later.

Still, I am game to try, and we are in a better position to buy than I have ever been in my adult life(we also recently paid off our credit cards and do have a small amount of money saved).  From what I can tell, it seems like it would be worth it for us because our income is so low and is not likely to change anytime soon, if ever.  Unfortunately, it does not seem like anyone wants to talk to me about Direct loans because there is no money in it for them.  If it is a guaranteed loan, they make money so will talk- but it looks like any help I get will have to come from the USDA office itself.  I am considering looking for a buyer's agent- but am unsure how hard it will be to find one familiar with this type of loan.  Thanks for your input.  As for houses that ""need work"" I am fully willing to work with cosmetic problems- but not about to get involved with anything structural. Inspections are part of the process, so I am hopeful we will at least know what we are getting into, and repairs can be rolled into the loan... We won't be expecting to move for a long time, if ever, because we do have a child to consider(we want to buy precisely because we want to be able to provide her with a stable home instead of moving frequently as tends to happen when renting in our experience)."
RealEstate,3b9k0b,ShortWoman,2,Sat Jun 27 05:49:55 2015 UTC,"No, you cannot roll repair costs into the loan. What is possible is to get a renovation loan. There are other strings attached to that money. It's time to talk to an expert. Remember that the USDA is not making the loan, they are merely writing the insurance policy that says you'll pay up. There is no point in talking to anybody at the USDA. If no lenders will talk to you, take that as a sign that maybe you aren't ready right now.  Keep in mind: the rule of thumb is to spend no more than a third of your monthly income on housing, regardless of whether you rent or own. So for example, if your household makes $3000 per month, you can afford to spend $1000 on housing, including mortgage principal, interest, taxes, and insurance."

I had read in another discussion somewhere on here that there are limits on the size a lot can be- that it must be ""modest"" or not large enough to subdivide... I will double check that, but if that isn't the case it would be great news.    I don't feel it is likely we will be income producing- my spouse is adamant that it stay homestead level(he has no desire to be a farmer by trade, though he appreciates farm animals in small numbers).  I am pretty sure that our most likely issue would be worrying about town ordinances, I doubt we would even be selling offspring of animals or anything like that- just trying to produce some of our own eggs, milk, and vegetables...meat possibly but unsure on that one."
RealEstate,3b9k0b,nofishies,2,Sat Jun 27 03:21:46 2015 UTC,"If that's your intention, just be cautious going into it. Income potential is the key.

I was just hoping it was possible to have a larger lot and a few animals, but again since I am getting student loan forgiveness based on disability I can at least be honest that making money is not a priority at this time.  That is actually why I was worried about the FSA loans- it sounds like you can only get those if you are honestly expecting to turn a profit..."
RealEstate,3b9k0b,kennedysdead,2,Sat Jun 27 03:58:57 2015 UTC,What you are looking for  (not a farm but can have animals that are bigger then a breadbox)  is not easy to find or finance. Mind you my evidence for this is anacdotal having a lot of internet friends all over the country trying to find  these. They know I'm in re so they tell me their woes. Talking to the USDA and finding out who else to talk to and having them steer you in the right directions is good.  Also start researching first time home buyer (x county) on Google and see if you can locate any closing cost help.  One thing you said might be a problem however. All these loans are owner occupied loans (I think you have gone into a few I'm not familiar with) you will have to live there immediately not in 2-3 years.

FHA is a federally guaranteed mortgage program open to any buyer and allows a downpayment as low as 3.5%. Don't forget that there will be closing costs. Don't spend all your money at closing, because there will be stuff that needs to be repaired or replaced at your new home.   Stop thinking of rent as ""throwing money away.""

In my area, when someone is looking for loan programs that are good for first timers we usually suggest USDA Rural Housing loan. This is a government funded loan, where you are not required to have any money for a down payment (it's factored into your loan).  I'm in Indiana, so this loan type is used a lot in some of our suburban areas outside of the city. There are also income requirements, so you can't make more than a certain amount. This Loan type should be available in a rural areas nationwide... We also have Indiana Housing loan option which is similar but usually in urban areas... There may be something similar in your state.   The person that will know best is a local mortgage lender. DO NOT GO TO YOUR BANK... Go to a mortgage lender-- as in that's all they do there.

In my jurisdiction, you have 60-days from the date you receive your annual value notice to appeal. One exception to the deadline is if you purchased the property after the value notices had gone out and your purchase price was less than 90% of the assessed value.    There is no cost to file an appeal. No lawyers are necessary for residential appeals where I'm from and it's rare that homeowners even hire a property tax rep unless it's a high value property. One of the tax rep companies in my area charge on a contingent basis: 25% of the tax savings they potentially get you, with a minimum fee of $350 whether they win or lose. So make sure your potential savings are worth it if you go the professional route. However, assuming your purchase was a true fair market, arms length deal, you shouldn't have a problem getting the assessor to lower the value."

In the area I live in, there is a form you can fill out at the Auditor's office.  They will schedule you for a 'hearing' in which you can submit your sales contracts showing the value of the home, etc.  I know in my area, valuation adjustments under 25,000 are usually approved without blinking an eye.  The person on the school board at the hearing, will usually start to object to any undocumented value adjustment over 25,000.    There are things that might make your sales value be disregarded in the process.  Purchasing from a bank, foreclosure, HUD, or family will generally lead to their reason to ignore the sales price.  It also needs to be a recent sale within the past two years, so dont wait too long to contest it.  Also look closely at what they state your property is.  Is the acreage accurate?  Number of rooms/ bathrooms?  Sq footage accurate?  My last house, they had the number of bedrooms wrong, as they counted a finished attic as a bedroom.    Where I live, they increase (I mean adjust) the values every 3 years.  They only drive by the property once every 6 years, to do an exterior inspection (from their car) and look for any new structures or additions.  The other increase is based on a set percentage assigned to the neighborhood or region based on the increase in sale prices in the area as well as a quick peek at satellite imagery looking for new buildings/ pools/ etc.)"

Here are my two cents:  1) to your first question, you may or may not need legal representation; I think it is a good idea, however, to have some representation. Where I am, an appraiser can represent you in a property tax appeal, and I think they offer good value. A lawyer can obviously represent you, but it really depends on your goal. The value I see in an appraiser is that they have access to the data to help shape your argument to the assessor. Your mileage may vary. If you aren't well-versed in real estate, I think you do yourself a disservice by attempting to handle this on your own.  as to 2) you should call around and get bids, keeping in mind that the lowest cost option often isn't the best option."

From what you've said, your situation sounds awfully open and shut, so it's probably not necessary. I would suggest that you might get slightly better results with one.  All the ones I know do it on contingency (30% of your tax savings or the like, no cost if you don't get a reduction) though that can include costs if you want or need to fight it further up the hierarchy."

But as far as where you should invest, maybe you should tell us why you think NYC real estate is the best place for your money? What do you think you can buy there, how much money are you going to make on it and how, and over how long? What about real estate appeals to you in general?   Real estate investing can be extremely risky especially for people who aren't educated. One thing is to be educated on the basics of real estate (practically any basic investing book will cover this) and then the other part is to know what the market you want to invest in is doing.   Real estate is cyclical and subject to all sorts of forces from supply and demand. If you don't have a good handle on both those concepts, IMO you have no business investing in real estate. Your odds are better in Vegas, and Vegas is more fun."

RealEstate,3ba69q,dpjackal89,2,Sat Jun 27 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"I am not familiar with NYC, as a disclaimer.   But investing in real estate is no different there, than anywhere else. You want to buy low and sell high. Whether you can actually do this depends on many factors. Real estate is nothing more than supply and demand. Understanding how those things (and the factors that impact them) work is key to making decisions that will make you money.   You need to understand what's going on in a market, where it is in the overall cycle of the area, what forces are acting upon it (good and bad) and then with all that data you should be able to spot a good deal.   If making money in real estate was as easy as buying a crappy place and fixing it up, everyone would do it. Flippers can make a nice living doing that but they will tell you it's a lot more complicated than that, lots of things can go wrong, and they probably have learned some expensive lessons along the way. Sometimes the best thing you can do with your money is walk away from a deal. If you don't know how to figure that out, don't invest your money yet, do your research."

RealEstate,3b8ijs,Xasten,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:49:01 2015 UTC,Is this through a broker or a direct lender?
RealEstate,3b8ijs,aardy,2,Fri Jun 26 20:56:59 2015 UTC,Broker.
RealEstate,3b8ijs,aardy,2,Fri Jun 26 20:58:03 2015 UTC,The original 3.875% was with a different lender than the folks offering you the 15 year?
RealEstate,3b8ijs,aardy,2,Fri Jun 26 21:15:17 2015 UTC,"Same lender. The broker's agent is telling me that by getting the clear to close with a 15 meant that any changes in loan term would invalidate the lock. Which makes no sense to me.  He's telling me he can maybe get a lower, but still 4+% rate with a new lender, but that would delay closing. The home builder is dying to close on 6/30, and any delays may lead to the cancellation of my contract and forfeiture of my earnest and upgrade money according to the builder's salesman (I haven't looked into this part yet to figure out if this is shady as hell or standard practice. I'll go through the purchase contract with a fine toothed comb soon.)"
RealEstate,3b8ijs,aardy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:22:24 2015 UTC,Is there a nice cozy relationship between the builder and mortgage broker?

RealEstate,3b8ijs,furrycalamari,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:44:55 2015 UTC,Only thing I can think of is that he had an investor that only had 30 year products when he locked you (I have a few like this).   Then he dropped that lock for an investor that had the full suite of standard products. And now he's looking at the 30 year product on the day you locked w/ the new investor.
RealEstate,3b8ijs,Murmaider,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:59:23 2015 UTC,Or the investor has in their seller guide that this type of product change takes you to worse case.  Someone is going to be taking a loss because FNCI isn't going to give you anywhere near the coverage you need versus a FNCL TBA.
RealEstate,3b8ijs,furrycalamari,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:49:09 2015 UTC,So the 15 year was supposed to be 3.875%?
RealEstate,3b8ijs,automator3000,2,Fri Jun 26 21:32:46 2015 UTC,"No. We originally had a 30 year quote for 3.875% We then had them quote us a 15 year (which had a different rate being a different loan term obviously), but we told them that we had yet to fully settle on the 30 versus the 15 year.   Here's the time line (dates off somewhat):  6/2: Lock in rate for that day for a 30 year note. 6/5: Tell them we are leaning towards 15 year 6/19: 15 year ready to close 6/24: Tell them we have decided to go with 30 year 6/25: We are told that the locked rate from 6/2 was invalidated by getting a clear to close on a 15 back on 6/19.  They proceeded on getting the 15 year set up as we were leaning towards it while we still mulled over the 15 versus the 30. We finally decided on the 30 year and they are saying that the original 30 year rate of 3.875 is now 4.375 despite us locking in the 30 year in the first place."
RealEstate,3b8ijs,underwriter1,3,Fri Jun 26 21:39:46 2015 UTC,Did you give them anything in writing for the 15 year loan?
RealEstate,3b8ijs,underwriter1,2,Sat Jun 27 00:26:45 2015 UTC,"Rates have jumped quite a bit this month. If that nullifies your rate lock, then it sounds like you're out of luck. Probably something that they should talk to their clients about if that is the case."

RealEstate,3b7pu2,Murmaider,2,Sat Jun 27 00:28:22 2015 UTC,"When I was in university, I lived in a situation like that (lived with my landlord's daughter.)   A lot of landlords will ask for post-dated cheques for this reason.   It's also helpful with students to have their parents guarantee the lease.  But if it's an issue, don't try to be nice. Be business-like. The day after the rent is due, say ""Hey, where's the rent?""  Follow up with written notices as needed as per law in your province. Meet them, talk to them, and if they are all ""Hey man, we're going to parTAY"" don't rent to them.  If they're all ""I really hope this place is quiet because I need to study"" then they are probably okay. Most people will be in the middle.  But beyond that, stay on top of things. If there's damage or dirt, call it out early so that no one starts getting away with stuff. Also, keep up your end of things--keep your part of the house clean, and if there's any maintenance issues take care of them quickly. This varies by province. But you should be able to find a fairly standard rental agreement. Note that (at least in Ontario, probably in other provinces) the law supercedes all leases, so I would be less concerned about the details of the lease and more concerned about learning what the law is.  (Note that in the US, the exact details of the lease seem to matter more.)"
RealEstate,3b7pu2,sonalogy,2,Fri Jun 26 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"Ugh. Having roommates is hard enough. I can't imagine being a roommate and a landlord at the same time.   You are going to be in a crappy position with your roommates and that is going to make your day to day life rough.   I don't know about Canadian real estate, but in the US you really want to start the eviction process as soon as allowed when rent is not paid. It's not that you want to or actually will end up evicting them, but it protects you and helps make rent a priority. The idea of serving your roommates a firm warning letter, followed by another and then the start of the eviction process is not going to go well for you and your belongings in the house.   My suggestion would be for them to factor in the cost of having a local property management company come in and do this. The numbers will have to work for your parents anyway, as you will eventually graduate and move on. They might as well do it now.  That's my 2 cents."
RealEstate,3b7pu2,SunshineAndGoldfish,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:39:05 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the type of students/tenants. Depending on how much the property management company charges - its not that hard and only requires you to be up front about the legality of the contract and terms/condition's for late payments.    2) Invite them over for coffee and review every section in the lease.... then review it again. Leases are legally binding contract that most people just glance over without actually understanding. Feel free to increase the security deposit if you think they are risky tenants.

What are the philosophies, goals, conditions that you use to make that decision?   Take the spread between the two interest rates in points.   Multiply that  by loan amount. Divide by monthly savings. This is your break-even point in months. If you're going to be in that home and in that loan for more than this long, take the lower rate. If not, take the higher rate.  Suppose the difference between 4.25% and 4.375% is 0.433 points on a $700k loan, and this will save you $51 per month.  .433% * $700k = $3031.  $3031 / $51 = 59 months = 4.9 years.

I think you're asking the difference between listing agent and selling agent. Selling agent or buyer's agent represents the buyer. It's a matter of opinion..

This is explicitly stated in the community’s Covenants; the section excerpted below is one of several in the Covenants that describe the restrictions on the use of XXXX housing: ARTICLE VII, SECTION 1. All Lots and building sites in the subdivision shall be used exclusively for private residential purposes. No building shall be erected, altered, placed or permitted to remain on any Lot other than one detached single family dwelling not to exceed 25 feet or two stories in height except with the prior written permission of the Architectural Control Committee. Height shall be measured from the highest origina l ground contour at any point adjoining the foundation perimeter of the Structure to the highest point on the Structure exclusive of standard chimneys. No building shall be permitted on any Lot unless such building has been duly constructed thereon and the removal of dwellings or structures from other locations to any Lot shall not be permitted. Each Lot shall be occupied and used as a private dwelling for the owner and members of his family, guests and tenants for single family residential purposes only a nd the Board of Directors may make rules which limit the maximum occupancy permitted upon Lots in the subdivision. No Lot shall be used for any business, manufacturing or commercial purpose whatsoever; provided, however, if the appropriate zoning so allows and if prior written approval of the Board of Directors is obtained, an Owner may use a specifically designated portion of his home as a home business office. This home business cannot be disruptive to the neighborhood or create parking problems for any n eighbors. The Board may, in its sole discretion withdraw or terminate the approval at any time if complaints are received or if other objections arise. Our HOA attorney has advised us that our Covenants permit the restriction or prohibition of continuing o ccupancy by unrelated parties, as well as the renting of rooms, which is a commercial activity like a boarding house or hotel. It is not our wish to exclude anyone, but we do enforce the Covenants with respect to the impact of tenants and property occupa nts on the community, especially in situations involving disturbances, parking, and safety issues. Our lots, streets, parking, and landscaping, as well as the less visible infrastructure such as electrical power, water and sewers, are all designed to supp ort occupancy by single families. In addition to XXXX Covenants, City law also applies in cases of disturbances and illegal public use of alcohol or marijuana. Reminder for landlords: Landlords are responsible for ensuring that all tenants conf orm to the Covenants. Tenant violations can result in fines, which can accrue and result in a lien placed on the property to ensure payment."

Two (or more) unrelated people can own single family residence together.  As for your situation, I see nothing in the HOA provided doc that would exclude you.  Most city ordinances in Colorado have this definition for a household:   ""ousehold means any of the following groups of individuals:  (1) Any number of persons related by blood, marriage or adoption, plus: a. Domestic servants employed for service on the premises; b. Up to four children under the age of 18 who may not be related to any or all of the other residents, but who are under the care and supervision of the adult family head; c. Any combination of subsections (1) or (2) of this section, not to exceed five individuals. (2) A group including not more than two adults, together with any number of children, related by blood or legal adoption to at least one of the adults; or (3) A group of not more than five unrelated or related and unrelated persons living together as a single housekeeping unit. (4) A household shall not, except for adjudicated delinquent children in foster care, include more than one individual who is a registered sex offender unless related by blood or marriage. For the purpose of this subsection, ""registered sex offender"" means any person required to register as a sex offender in accordance with Article 22 of Title 16 of the Colorado Revised Statutes as amended.""  In your case you would fit under this part:  ""A group of not more than five unrelated or related and unrelated persons living together as a single housekeeping unit.""  I am guessing this person who you are communicating with is not even associated with the HOA.  Tell them to pound sand.  Even if it is the HOA, tell them to pound sand.  The reference above even mentions tenants.  Don't get caught up in the ""single family residence"" part.  Again, that is just a zoning thing, not a HOA thing.  ""Single"" refers to it being a stand alone unit."

RealEstate,3b3xj6,NumNumLobster,0,Fri Jun 26 19:57:56 2015 UTC,"Nothing here makes your situation better, even if parts  of it are true, or are sympathetic to your situation.  There are often free law clinics you might be able to find in your area.  That's a much better solution than starting a pissing contest with various organizations, all of which have lawyers.  Screwing up a housing situation can leave you very poor, possibly indebted, and with bad credit, which puts your future housing options in dire jeopardy."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,guzzle,13,Thu Jun 25 21:42:31 2015 UTC,"I do think OP may benefit from a lawyer, but I'd politely disagree on the rest.  OP is in a situation where multiple parties are alleging claims against them that are unfounded.  His/her landlord also has a claim against them from the HOA, which does appear to be valid and can't be resolved without OP voluntarily agreeing to do so.    OP doesn't have a problem. They have no situation that needs to be made better.  People are putting pressure on them hoping they will get nervous and help those people fix their problems.  OP has a payday coming here.  There is no need for a pissing contest, but making it clear to everyone you aren't going to be bullied and if they want you to cooperate they need to give you an incentive and not threats seems prudent to me.    But yeah get a lawyer etc"
RealEstate,3b3xj6,wamazing,8,Thu Jun 25 21:47:34 2015 UTC,"I suppose I politely agree with you if by telling the HOA to ""f*** off"" you really mean saying something like, ""I appreciate your concern.  Please feel free to express your concern in writing to my landlord, who is the party responsible for upholding your CC&Rs.  I really wish I could help you further, but I'm in an agreement with him, not you.  Please feel free to include me in any future written correspondence and if there's anything I can do to help resolve this amicably, please let me know?""...  See my concern?  It's maybe not the broad strokes of your advice, is the shorthand.  The last thing you want to be in this unfortunate situation is cavalier or dismissive.  This could get expensive in a hurry.  Let's play a scenario out.  Let's say, HOA can fine Property Management Company.  Let's say PMC has a lease that can pass fines from HOAs on to leasee.  Let's say that bill goes unpaid.  Now PMC passes debt on to debt collector.  Now you have to deal with that, plus dings on your credit.  - I personally have no direct experience with this, but what little indirect experience I have, this is a nightmare to resolve and it likely will not happen.  In the next seven years, you'll have that ding and it'll come up for every future land, car, loan transaction you make.  OP's goal should be to avoid this situation at all costs.   It may mean he tucks tail and finds the least painful way to extract himself from his lease.  In a perfect world, PMC refunds all deposits, breaks lease, pays moving expenses, and finds a way to help with any deposit in a bridge between now and then.  I expect much less from a PMC that lets this situation come to pass in the first place, and so should OP."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,NumNumLobster,26,Thu Jun 25 22:30:15 2015 UTC,"Well you can't be evicted without being taken to court. I'd tell them, file on me, we'll go let the judge sort it out. Costs you nothing (unless you get an attorney, which is certainly an option) and if you lose, well, you have a certain amount of time to find a place.   If you have a lease and you haven't broken the terms I am betting a judge will let you stay. The judge is not going to give a shit about HOA rules. That's my bet but, IANAL, and I guess it comes down to how badly you want to gamble on it. Many courts tend to be sympathetic to renters and throw the book at homeowners.   The flip side of that is, if the property management company wants to keep everyone happy they might be willing to pick up some of your expenses to move.   Keep paying your rent if you want to stay, because otherwise you certainly can be evicted.   Good luck and we love to hear updates on these types of stories if you think about it, once it's over."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,mightyzombie,20,Thu Jun 25 20:17:13 2015 UTC,"I can't even imagine going to that eviction hearing.  I'd be embarrassed to show up, would expect the judge to rip me a new one, and highly think my lawyers would tell me not to even file it.    IANAL and all, but have been in eviction court a time or two, but holy shit that is a horrible case from the landlord side.  I think they are bluffing hard."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,Olipyr,21,Thu Jun 25 20:29:37 2015 UTC,"Having been in a very similar circumstance before, I give this piece of advice which I wish someone had given to me: Don't let the property management company off the hook. They are supposed to know this stuff. It's why you pay them extra on top of the actual rent: to MANAGE the property.  I lived in a house with several other friends, which we rented from the owner via a property management company (MyHomeSpot). A month after moving in, we learned the neighborhood had an HOA, and, from them, that the county we now lived in had an ordinance prohibiting more than 2 unrelated persons from living in the same dwelling. Meaning, we could not legally live there.  MyHomeSpot was sympathetic, and we had previously had good relations with them, so I believed them when they said they would waive the move-in fees on a new place and assist us with relocation fees (truck rental, movers, utility deposits, etc.), providing we moved into another MyHomeSpot managed property.  When the time came we were told to provide them with invoicing for the relocation fees, and they would be applied as a credit to our account, rather than the company simply paying for, and providing, movers, and/or the money upfront to pay for utility deposits at the new place.  We were then told, after already finding a place and beginning the move-in, that they could not actually waive the move-in fees, because it was all computerized and the system required the move-in fees to actually be paid to finalize it, and we'd need to pay it up-front, and they would just apply it as a credit to our account. I'm sure everyone can see where this is going.  None of these credits ever happened. And, sadly, because they had been so quick to admit fault, and begin offering solutions to the issues that they had caused us, we never got any of these promises in writing, and we were just out all the expenses for moving into a home that we didn't get to stay in, and liked better than the one in which we ended up."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,ShortWoman,7,Thu Jun 25 21:24:55 2015 UTC,oh man that sounds terrible. I will make sure to keep everything in writing. I have asked my roomies to not talk to anyone and just tell them to send us a letter. Thanks for the advice.
RealEstate,3b3xj6,wamazing,3,Thu Jun 25 21:39:29 2015 UTC,"It's a lesson to always get everything in writing, email, text, some sort of hard copy. That goes for landlords, PMs, and tenants. I've been burned in the past because I didn't do my due diligence and have a few things in writing.  Be sure you take pictures before you move in and after you've moved all your stuff out. Have a friend and her friend that are getting charged a $600 trash removal fee because apparently they left about 12 bags of trash in the place. I don't believe it one bit knowing this person and having been over there.   It's sad that a person's word is not good anymore."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,ShortWoman,15,Fri Jun 26 01:23:06 2015 UTC,"Wait for something to be in writing from someone. Phone rings? Knock at the door? ""I'm real sorry, but I need you to put that in writing. Surely you understand.""  I bet you didn't know that HOAs can change the rules at almost any meeting. It's possible that this is a new rule, and it's possible that the HOA only recently found out you guys were renters."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,joestir,9,Thu Jun 25 20:47:39 2015 UTC,This is entirely possible and thanks for pointing that out.   It's also possible the HOA are just being a bunch of assholes lol.
RealEstate,3b3xj6,bwik,6,Thu Jun 25 21:23:11 2015 UTC,"Heck, it's entirely possible that some nosy neighbor who isn't even on the HOA board is an asshole, which would explain why OP hasn't received any written notification from the PM (they're covering their asses by waiting for something in writing from somebody with authority)."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,bwik,8,Thu Jun 25 23:31:31 2015 UTC,"You can def stay until your lease ends, the issue is between HOA and owner and you don't have to pay those fines, the owner does. There is a lot of good advice here already, just wanted to add a few things.  All your communication should be in writing. If they call you, tell them to send you a letter instead. Likewise, all communication you send should be in writing. Save copies of everything.   Get a copy of the HOA rules. Ask a neighbor if you have to, but the HOA will probably give you one. Make sure you don't break any HOA rules or any provisions of your lease or else they can take action against you later. Don't give them any excuse to kick you out legally.   Lastly, start scoping out some alternative living arrangements. Once they realize you are staying they might offer you cash for keys, but that means nothing if you don't have a plan to vacate. Be prepared to find a comparable place and present them with an offer to move if they pay to move you there."

RealEstate,3b3xj6,catjuggler,6,Thu Jun 25 21:40:39 2015 UTC,"I think I am seeing the issue.  Renting is permitted by HOA.  However, room-by-room renting is NOT allowed by HOA.  This is not unusual.  Zoning in cities often has this rule.  Owner put up the property in good faith, knowing HOA rule, expecting it to be rented to 1 party.  Mgmt company was sloppy in doing multi-party rental in this house.  It breaks the rule.  HOA is correct to attempt to enforce.  Mgmt company screwed up (their very lease itself violates HOA).  The owner and the mgmt company each failed to follow HOA.  The renters are the last people who would be liable for the fees."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,NumNumLobster,5,Fri Jun 26 03:16:31 2015 UTC,"We all signed the same lease as a party all liable for the entire house. I don't think that would be room-by-room would it?   But still the point is the same, I should not be responsible for any fees."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,catjuggler,-1,Fri Jun 26 03:40:02 2015 UTC,"If you are more than 2 signers to the lease who are not related, that suggests you will live there together.  So it's functionally a rooming house.  That would violate zoning and HOA in many areas.  The lease is not the problem; the problem is the people living there.  It does not conform to single family usage as it is often legally defined."

RealEstate,3b3xj6,pdclkdc,4,Fri Jun 26 03:20:22 2015 UTC,Just sit pretty and leave it to hoa and management company to deal with it. Something similar happened where a homeowner who bought a condo using a first time home buyer program from the city rented it to my friend. Someone probably ratted him out and the city came to check. The homeowner had the audacity to ask my friend to lie for him but refused and moved out. She asked him for her rent and deposit back minus the 2 weeks she stayed. He refused claiming it wasn't his fault. I helped her sue him in small claims and she won.
RealEstate,3b3xj6,junegloom,2,Thu Jun 25 21:14:28 2015 UTC,"This is pretty fascinating from a legal perspective. Seems that in this kind of situation, the landlord still has to find some default in the lease between the landlord and the tenant. The fact the landlord violated the HOA rules, to which the landlord agreed when he/she purchased the property, isn't really relevant to whether OP breached the lease between him/her and the landlord. As to the fines, I'd be shocked if the lease really read in a way that allowed those to be passed on. The lease may say that landlord can pass on fines incurred due to tenants conduct,  but these fines are due to landlord's conduct (landlord's breach of the HOA rules by renting the property out). Your best bet is to hold your ground until you get something in writing and then look for a landlord/tenant attorney. Check with the local law school(s), as some have clinics that work landlord/tenant disputes."

RealEstate,3b3xj6,Forevercynic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:44:43 2015 UTC,"One thing to be aware of: It is not your responsibility to comply with the HOA, nor is it the management company's: It's the homeowner's. They entered into a legal agreement to lease a home to you, so you have a right to the lease as it was sold to you. Any fees that result from that are the homeowner's responsibility.   Now, the homeowner/management group can try to terminate your lease, assuming you have one, or simply give you an eviction notice if you are month-to-month. But they must comply with local and state law regarding the timing of this, as well as the lease. That may include a buy-out option, ie, they agree to buy you out of your lease.   But under no circumstances can they force you out of a lease by breaking your rights as a tenant."
RealEstate,3b3xj6,LadyA052,2,Thu Jun 25 23:11:34 2015 UTC,Let's say the property management company does present these guys with a bill for paying a HOA fine next month.  What should they do?  Just ignore it?
RealEstate,3b3xj6,InTherapy,2,Fri Jun 26 06:18:36 2015 UTC,Contest if in writing and pay normal rent.  If they refuse it escrow it.  Probably lawyer time at that point though
RealEstate,3b3xj6,LadyA052,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:08:48 2015 UTC,No matter what happens the quickest they can kick you out is 30 days. This matter is between the HOA and the property owner. The HOA can't do a damn thing to you. Let them sort it out and be ready to find a new place in the mean time. If you do end up moving then I would be looking at the property manager/owner to pick up the tab on any expenses (I'd hire movers for sure).   Edit: Unless your 1 year lease is up and the company gives you 30 days notice to move out. In that case they are well within their rights to terminate and there isn't anything you could or should do about it.
RealEstate,3b89gt,awsxdrfvgyhnjik,3,Fri Jun 26 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"How low is low income? What price range are you looking at?  At too low a price range, no agent is going to want to deal with it. The driving around is not worth the few hundred bucks in commission, so you'll need to do your own legwork, if you're looking at a low price.  A lot of rural land is zoned like R40, which means they have to be at least 40 acres and max of one house per 40 acres allowed. (People do break rules and build more houses sometimes, but they're not going to be able to split the lot and sell you a portion.) So I would stick is price, and ignore the size part.  You might have better luck buying a cheap house is a dilapidated city, like Detroit or Cleveland. At least, there were still cheap houses a year ago. Not sure about the lack of regulation though."
RealEstate,3b89gt,ethidda,3,Fri Jun 26 21:25:33 2015 UTC,"Good luck with the lifestyle.  I would start by figuring out exactly how much you make, and then determining exactly how much you can save per year. ONLY after a year or two of saving money would I begin to look.   During that two year time frame, I would explore what areas of the country were suited to both peoples needs, whether that's online exploration or actually visiting. I would also address issues of housing, do you want something old and original that's been forgotten, or are you trying to get into one of the new container houses, or geodomes etc...   If you know what type of structure you want that could help since many companies build those to order. Container houses in my area go for about 90-120k to build and install. Then you need to furnish the insides. There's a company out of NJ that does them, that's all I know it was a slow day at home and I was skimming.  So now you're two years in, you've got some money saved up together, you know where you want to go and what you want to get. Next step is getting it!  Buying land is weird, I'm no expert, but what I've read indicates that land is much cheaper if you can make a cash offer. If you need to finance it land can be quite expensive. Also every dumbass with land thinks their plot is worth a kabillion dollars. Learn about mineral rights, erosion, fires, mudslides etc.. whatever disaster happens to be your areas flavor. Having utility hookups on the land will be significantly cheaper than installing them (not sure how off the grid you intend to go but running water is pretty nice). Also look into your local utilities rules, some places may require you to pay for the lines to get run with language like 'zsxdf co only covers cost 30 feet from nearest electrical pole' you could be on the hook for the remaining installation to your house if your house is 250 feet away. Try to find someone that specializes in sales here. Also try to find something with a structure on it that you can expand on if possible, all of that will help keep your costs lower. Edit: This is also where having some money will help you, you along with a lot of other off the grid types pursue this sort of lifestyle, imagine how many dead broke guys call up the broker trying to haggle a deal? Imagine being that broker yeah? You would want to shoot yourself. Having cash in hand will get this guy to work wonders for you.   If you are building your own home that won't qualify for the same loan as a traditional house. Expect to pay more or put down a larger deposit. Why? Well there's no asset to speak of.   Edit 2: http://mpora.com/articles/treehouse-worlds-coolest-home  The guy that built that place is very active on instagram, fb etc.. you could probably ask him a lot of questions and get answers about it since he's living the lifestyle."

Right before you close, the title agency will contact you and let you know the exact amount you need to bring with you. This information is obtained when the HUD-1 is issued, but I didn't see my HUD-1 until I closed. The HUD-1 is a document that itemizes all of the services and fees involved in the purchase. You will need to get a cashier's check from your bank for the amount they tell you. Do not bring a personal check, they will not accept it. Just go to your bank and tell them you need a  cashiers check. It will not be made out to you, the check is made out to the title agency so make sure to confirm who the cashiers check should be issued to.  There can be any number of people at closing, for me it was just the title agent and my realtor, though I'm not sure the realtor is always there - he's a friend of mine. The title agent came to MY office to close. I liked having them come to me, I felt more comfortable in a familiar environment. Not sure if that is always an option.  At closing the title agent will walk you through all of the paperwork, explaining everything that you're signing. If there is something that you don't completely understand, make sure you ask. This is your last chance to clarify something before the transaction is complete. The title agent actually stopped and made me call my lender in the middle of the process. My finance charges looked extremely low to him, about half what he typically sees. Turns out I just got a really great deal and everything was fine. Make sure everything you're signing is accurate. If your name is spelled wrong, make sure you tell them. There will be a giant stack of papers, I'd say I either signed or initialed 50 different times. Don't feel rushed, it's important to understand everything you're signing. Tell the title agent to slow down if you need to.  It took me 45 minutes to complete the process, not sure if that is typical. It was a fairly easy process for me, from finding the house all the way through to closing. Tonight is my first night in my new house, it feels great to finally be moved in and calling this place my home. Congrats on your house!"

A transfer can take 1-3 days and will delay closing. I keep my savings in an online-only account, so at least a week before closing I had to initiate a transfer into my local checking account to be prepared."

You can ask the title company doing the transfer for an 'attorney's package' to be sent to you a day or so ahead of closing...that will contain all the papers you'll be signing.  I requested this and compared legal descriptions, etc., and did my very thorough review the night before, then in the room itself I compared legal descriptions again to make damn sure we were signing for the exact property we'd seen and had surveyed.  No one was offended at my triple checking, though the sellers may have been, had they not been elsewhere."

I thought that was by design. Second time, I think we were all in the same room. Third and fourth times, sellers were not in the local area so they signed remotely. The last time was really interesting because the seller was out of the country. I did my closing but it was several days before he completed his. A little scary but I got the keys and tried not to worry about it.  tl;dr, I guess every closing is different, but make sure you understand what you're signing and trust the title company to get it done."

That's a high interest to pay just to avoid something that to be honest, likely won't give you an edge in the buying process in the Midwest."
RealEstate,3b6icw,farmerfoo,2,Fri Jun 26 11:48:34 2015 UTC,"""So what's wrong with a mortgage?""  Thats what I am trying to figure out.  I am asking the costs of getting a mortgage vs the method I am doing.  Obviously the cost of the method I am proposing is paying the high interest rate over the 1-2 years.  The market is Madison, WI.  So I dont know if that makes it any ""Hotter"" than the rest of the mid-west, but from watching RedFin, ive noticed houses we would be interested in going relatively quickly (2 Weeksish for a lot of them).  Maybe my cash advantage wouldnt even exist in this market?  I am also confident that the loan wouldnt require any collateral as our credit is good, and weve received a similiar loan in the past."
RealEstate,3b6icw,Bloodhound01,5,Fri Jun 26 11:56:24 2015 UTC,There is nothing wrong in just getting a mortgage and paying it off quickly. Make sure there arent any prepayment penalties. Most dont have any just ask your lender and its basically a low interest loan.  Then just make extra payments every month and you will be fine.  Two weeks for a house is NOT a house going quickly like you are claiming. That is plenty of time.
RealEstate,3b6icw,Bloodhound01,2,Fri Jun 26 12:33:09 2015 UTC,"Let me be more specific in what I am asking.  If I took out a $100,000 mortgage, what would be the extra costs that I would pay (outside of the interest of the mortgage) assuming no pre-payment penalty and I paid it off in a similiar time frame to the personal loan?"
RealEstate,3b6icw,Bloodhound01,2,Fri Jun 26 12:42:38 2015 UTC,"Nothing, you will pay closing costs and the typical things coming with closing a house of course, but there aren't any hidden fees if that's what you are asking and you would be doing that anyway with a personal loan also.   There really is no difference from my understanding besides the interest rate. You are probably going to be looking at an interest rate at least 2x as high as a mortgage interest rate on a personal loan if you get the best you can.  http://www.bankrate.com/funnel/personal-loans/personal-loan-results.aspx?state=WI&market=198  What makes you so afraid of a a mortgage?

I also just am not clear on how origination fees and other fees are involved with a mortgage and how they might differ form a personal loan."
RealEstate,3b6icw,BustedBottle,3,Fri Jun 26 13:05:03 2015 UTC,"All that stuff is factored into your closing costs I believe, but i am not sure how it works with a personal loan, none of those fees are that much money though.  I don't think you'd have any problem at all closing within 30 days, i don't believe that is uncommon. Especially with your finances, they would have nothing to be concerned about that would delay the process.  Edit: there are no fees to go talk to a lender, its quick and it doesn't hurt."

If it's a portfolio product, then it is entirely up to the lender to make up whatever they want as they see fit.

She wants a duplex, and we found one with a consistent rental history, and she was told that she can't count that income, even with the history.   Portfolio products are generally for a very specific niche and for borrowers that fit inside a very small box.   Also, there was no interest rate bump up to 4 units as long as she was owner occupying.   If that is the way that this specific lender is rolling with this specific portfolio product, that's kind of that.  They are letting you guys have the stated (eg, completely fake as far as anyone knows?) income, which is pretty ""WOW!"" for 2015. To let you get the stated (fake?) income and anticipated (fake?) rent would be... let's split the difference between hard money lender at 10% and conventional conforming mortgage at 4%, deal? And then bump that interest rate by half a percent.  Call it 7.5% as the interest rate for a 3/1 adjustable rate mortgage with stated (fake?) income and (presumed?) rental income, if anyone were to offer that.

I know exactly how portfolio products work, that was actually a very rude response.    I also know that Freddie/Fannie allows for owner occupant rates up to 4 units, as does FHA, that was not a portfolio product.  I a was asking if what YOU were referring to was a portfolio product because I have been told that Freddie/Fannie does not allow for rental income to be counted unless it is a unit that a person has been personally collecting rent for 2 years to be used as income, and then it is counted at 75% to allow for vacancy and maintenance."
RealEstate,3b5xzp,landofmisfits,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:53:58 2015 UTC,"Ah, OK. I understood your question backwards - I was thinking you were trying to have your cake and eat it too with a portfolio product by picking Fannie for this part and their specific portfolio stuff for the other part. Can't mix and match. :)  $0.50 in the below examples represent her current credit card debts, monthly.  $0.80 in the below examples are her current rent at her apartment.  $2 is her PITI payment.  $1.75 is her income from rent received, at 75%.  So, Fannie, owner occupied duplex:  DTI will be calculated by using PITI mostly just like a credit card bill. This is division.  $0.5 + (no rent) + $2(PITI) / $3 + $1.75(rent income) = 52%. DTI too high, does not qualify.  Fannie, pure investment property duplex:  Rent @ 75% minus PITI. As income, provided it is positive. This is subtraction.  $0.5 + $0.80(her paying rent) + $0(no PITI on this side of the division symbol) / $3 + $0.25(her rent income - PITI) = 40%. DTI is fine, easily qualified.    In the latter 'easily qualified' scenario, all the owner-occupied goodies and incentives are gone, and the interest rate is higher."

RealEstate,3b5xzp,landofmisfits,0,Fri Jun 26 07:38:41 2015 UTC,"So you are saying with Fannie, she can use the rental income if she buys it as an investment property?  Her reported income isn't too far off of what she makes, but she's a 21 year old-it's not necessarily tracked 100% when she has a late night, just puts her right at the edge of what she qualifies for.  She actually has no debt except for her car and student loans.  She does have 1 credit card that she pays off every month. She is paying $400 a month on her student loans that she is only obligated to pay $60 on so that they will be paid off by the end of the year.  She is refinancing her car from a 3.5 to a 1.99 interest rate with our credit union-she just bought it, put $6500 down and financed $18,000, and credit union is offering a promo at very little cost, so it makes sense.  This is how close she is to qualifying for what she needs, that we are doing these little things to get her that much closer.  She is picking up another bartending job for extra income, but as you know, that won't count either.  She has about 10k in the bank and is only looking to spend 50-60k.  There is one we looked at listed at 50k with $750 income from the unit she wouldn't be living in and a total income currently of $1225.  Her payment would be lower than she could find to rent anywhere and she would have the income.  Her plan would be to put $200 a month in a maintenance account and $150 extra toward the principle of the loan.  Minimal money down if possible (which is one reason we were looking at owner occupant loans) to keep cash in her pocket for maintenance and emergencies.  It just seems sad that a kid who has it together so much better than most her age financially can't take advantage of one hell of an opportunity to take the first steps to financial freedom."

I'm not going to sit here and write that she should commit mortgage fraud.  I will say, however, that the arithmetic on the income side of things is significantly different if she walks into my office and says it will be a pure investment property and that she will not live there.  But of course then we need a real down payment if it is an investment property. Down payment gifts from family, on investment properties, can be a challenge if there isn't time to season the down payment funds.   ""Seasoning"" just means it needs to have been in her account, sitting there and untouched, for a few months. No magical $70k deposit showing up on the most recent two months of bank statements that cannot be explained as income she earned."

She does pay half of all expenses though utilities etc.  Really down payment on 50k would be 12,500 at 25%-isn't that what investment requires?  She is close to that now and then would need the reserves also.  Maybe I am a worry wart, but I am a little weary of interest rates going up so fast lately.  I guess I could put some money in there now and hopefully it will be past the 2 months bank statements she needs for qualifying by the time the right one comes along-her birthday is in a couple weeks, it could just be a birthday present, then she can be more flexible when the time comes.  Another thought I had was to wait a year or two and she should be able to save enough that she could pay cash on a cheaper one and then just take a HELOC to have for expenses if necessary.  She just doesn't want to wait that long, but she's willing to pick up as many shifts as she can to put money aside too, it will just not be able to be counted as income either."

RealEstate,3b2qq7,NumNumLobster,5,Thu Jun 25 14:24:51 2015 UTC,"That's what the dissent would say. The majority would say no, because there's got to be ""robust causality"" over something that there's no ""valid interest,"" and indeed is a policy, not just a decision. It has actually to be discriminatory for no good reason other than to discriminate quietly.   The majority seems to emphasize that it should be a stiff case to make. The dissent doesn't think that it's working out.  Although, all of this is something of a sideshow to the main disagreement over interpreting statutory language. This wasn't a great place for Alito to swing for the fence."
RealEstate,3b2qq7,Malort_without_irony,2,Thu Jun 25 15:50:17 2015 UTC,"So this is a Disparate Impact case which in the context of housing is a lot of bullshit, but I'll leave that technical discussion to others.   I would just like to point out the background for this case:   There are low income housing subsidy programs for developers that encourage them to build low income housing. With the aid of this program developers can afford to build low income housing.  Developers build low income housing in low income areas.  Lawsuit because providing low income housing in mostly racially low income areas is a disparate impact.   Which is entirely stupid. Of course they are building in low income areas. That is where they can afford to buy dirt and build. Even then they need a subsidy to make the numbers work.   And that is where the low income people are that need low income housing. If they build in high income areas under the standards tests (% of local area median income) it won't be low income housing anymore. It will be middle income plus housing.  New plan: Just shutdown the low income housing subsidy program and builders will stop building low income housing altogether."
RealEstate,3b2qq7,DCCWA,3,Thu Jun 25 16:16:29 2015 UTC,"This is when those technicalities matter, because the Court agrees with you. After a few examples, generally suggesting a lot of latitude for developers, the Court writes:   The litigation at issue here provides an example. From the standpoint of determining advantage or disadvantage to racial minorities, it seems difficult to say as a general matter that a decision to build low-income housing in a blighted inner-city neighborhood instead of a suburb is discriminatory, or vice versa.    and follows with what amounts to telling the lower court a script to bounce it on (the Jones' concurrence) that agrees with the newer interpretation of HUD, which provides for a much easier bar for a defendant (valid business purpose rather than least discriminatory version) and emphasizes the importance of causality, not just happenstance. And while that concurrence looks more at the potential conflict between the federal and state rules, it's effectively the problem you raise - if it's a low income property is low income areas.  What the majority doesn't want to happen is to do away with the concept altogether, while bringing it more in line to how disparate impact is dealt with in employment situations."

They bought the house 20 years ago and that was the last time they bought or sold property. They were fine with us using an agent but I dont think any of us knew what that would entail. I dont think the agentvreally knew how it would work either when it came to his commission in this situation. He assured us it was part of the price and the seller would kick it back to him. I am pretty devastated at this point. We are 4 days from closing and are about to walk away because we can't pay this surprise $4000. So bummed."

RealEstate,3b4j76,farmerfoo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:07:37 2015 UTC,Why would the seller object to the agent? They aren't the ones paying him.   The reason they went FSBO is to AVOID paying an agent.

RealEstate,3b4j76,landofmisfits,2,Fri Jun 26 19:00:00 2015 UTC,"Wow. Sounds like a rough deal, I'm sorry you're stuck in that situation! In Texas, I do know that the Buyer/Tenant Representation agreements we have our clients sign with us do state that if for any reason, the seller refuses to pay the commission cost, that you would be expected to pay it for our services as a buyers agent. Though, in that situation, your agent should do their very best to negotiate the contract to reduce the other costs you're responsible for, such as closing costs and things like that in order to make up for it... Typically, yes, with a listing in the MLS, the seller will pay for the costs for brokerage services (both sides) since they've signed a listing agreement with the agent that's representing them and it is included in that agreement that they're going to be responsible for the fees. Sigh... I hope it works out for you. Please, be sure to read EVERYTHING you sign your name to in the future. Your agent should have explained everything to you, especially knowing you were interested in a FSBO home."
RealEstate,3b4j76,landofmisfits,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:33:23 2015 UTC,"Typically on a FSBO who will pay the commission is spelled out in the purchase contract or addendum to the sales contract.  It is customary for a seller to pay, but not in a FSBO, did you sign an exclusive buyer contract with your agent?  If so, and it is not in the contract differently where it was negotiated with the seller to pay it, then you are on the hook for it."
RealEstate,3b4j76,landofmisfits,2,Thu Jun 25 22:44:11 2015 UTC,"I do believe we signed an exclusive buyers contract, but when we were making our offer our agent told us the seller would be paying his commission and we would need to tack on the 3% to our offer to compensate."

RealEstate,3b2sd9,ctrealestateatty,5,Thu Jun 25 14:52:45 2015 UTC,"My loan originator was making calls almost daily to the department head after the 10-day waiting period. He had just gotten off the phone with the National Director this week when he got an email from the appraisal company saying they've finally contacted her. He couldn't contact them directly as it's apparently grounds for termination.   Also, it seems to me that the appraisers work from home so it wasn't as if the appraisal company could walk over to her desk.  I'd be surprised if she has a job after this."
RealEstate,3b2sd9,Look_You_Dumb_Shit,3,Thu Jun 25 14:58:00 2015 UTC,"Probably best to have them contact the AMC (Appraisal Management Company). It's a required 3rd party in the process.

First time home-buyer, so I appreciate the advice."
RealEstate,3b2sd9,wamazing,2,Thu Jun 25 18:31:48 2015 UTC,"Yep.  If they were going to do an as-complete/renovated value, they were going to need the proposed renovation plans and the construction costs.  If they don't get those in a timely manner, it can really push the dates out.  The more detail you provide up front, the faster these things turn around I've found.  If the costs/plans weren't provided, I don't see it worth pursuing legally.  May just cost you more money.  You would have to prove damages.    Edit: words"
RealEstate,3b2sd9,aardy,5,Thu Jun 25 20:22:05 2015 UTC,"The appraiser is not your client and owes you no fiduciary duty. So I doubt you have a claim against them.   The lender is the one who should have been on top of it. If the appraiser flaked, they should have cancelled it and sent it to someone else at the first sign of real trouble.   BUT I will say more than once, I turned in a report, the lender didn't like it (the value wasn't high enough) and they spent two weeks beating me up on the phone and emails trying to get me to raise the value, all while telling the homeowner I hadn't turned in the report. I know that's what they told the HO because those were the voice mails I was getting from the HO. However I couldn't tell the HO that because my duty is one of confidentiality to the lender.   The lender stands to make quite a bit more money off of you than the appraiser will, so, just consider that there may be another side of this story that no one is telling you. Good luck though."
RealEstate,3b2sd9,wamazing,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:46:32 2015 UTC,"I appreciate that.

RealEstate,3b33fj,harrywhite1,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:18:23 2015 UTC,"I sent a personal PM to OP, but I thought maybe someone else could glean some information from my response:  So yeah, my primary job is to tell community associations how much money they should have in their reserve accounts to avoid needing special assessments or loans.  Another part of my job is to conduct ""transition studies"" when an association is being turned over from developer to board control to make sure there are no construction/design/condition defects.  I've been doing this a little more than nine years and for the most part, it's turned me off to community living completely.  Regarding your specific issue, here are the red flags I see:  1) The treasurer is a lay person. Even if he/she means well, it does not mean they know what they're talking about.  You need to know the potential cost of these repairs and how much money is in the settlement account.  The cost of repairs should also consider any change orders for when they open up the walls and find out what's really been going on for the last decade.  As someone mentioned in one of the comments, settlements are settlements and rarely cover the cost of remediation.  Developers pay settlements because it's cheaper than fixing the problem.  2) The treasurer says they're going to take money out of reserves.  The reserve account is meant for normal wear and tear replacements for large expenses, not for defect remediation.  Any dollar that gets pulled out to pay for this defect remediation is a dollar that isn't being saved to pay for the roofs/siding/pool/whatever else.  If the reserves are short, that means that whoever the owners are at the time of needed repair will have to make up the shortfall (ie special assessment).  Now, if there are no big projects on the horizon, then the Association would have more time to make up the savings and any raises in dues may not be terrible.  Does all of this mean it's a deal killer?  Not necessarily.  There's a price for anything.  The problem is there are a lot of unknowns that may be very expensive.  If you can buy the place for $50k, then yeah, maybe it's worth it.  I've seen some real horror stories where a 7-story brick building needs to have all of its brick taken off and replaced because the flashing around the windows and doors was improperly done and there was mold in the walls.  A lot of these construction defects will only get worse as you peel back the layers.  I almost thing you hang back and watch how it unfolds.  Maybe in six months the repairs will be underway and they have a better idea of what the total cost will be.  Yeah, you might lose out on the unit of your dreams, but you may also be sidestepping a landmine.  It's a tough call for sure.  Just remember, there are always more places to live."

I now live across the street (different complex) and I've seen no signs whatsoever that they're working on the problems. The defect is with the siding, very visible."
RealEstate,3b33fj,junegloom,1 point,Mon Jun 29 15:36:50 2015 UTC,"Inspect your property, particularly the roof/flashing, brickwork, and deck.  If it appears to be in good shape then you probably have nothing to worry about.  If something crops up this could actually be a good thing because they have the settlement funds to repair it (and it is on record that this construction defect existed, therefore they have a responsibility to pay out now that they took the settlement).    Your best hope would be to talk to a long-time resident and see if they had any major problems though.  The deck is probably HOA responsibility so it doesn't matter so much.  The flashing and brick work though could leak into your unit which affects your property even if the HOA maintains the flashing and brick.  I don't know who maintains what but I'm guessing they maintain and replace the decks, flashing, and brick.  GUESSING.  You have to look at your docs to be sure.    Personally I would not be too concerned unless the defects affected plumbing or electrical (stuff that's a pain in the ass to get to and can affect the entire property, and may be your responsibility), or if the association were refusing to make the repairs they are responsible for."
RealEstate,3b33fj,throwaway_hoa,6,Thu Jun 25 19:44:37 2015 UTC,"I'm on a phone so I'll keep this short.  I'm a civil engineer that specifically works with condo/townhomes/hoas regarding transition defects and remediation.  Even if the decks are common elements, if they need replacements, the board will tap the reserves or the settlement funds.  If there aren't enough funds, the owners will get hit with a special assessment.  Ultimately any shortfall in money will be levied back against the unit owners, since in the end, the unit owners collectively make up the association.  The million dollar question is what was the extent of the defects, have they been repaired and if they haven't been repaired, did the association receive enough in settlement funds or have enough saved in reserves to cover it.  In my experience, probably 95% of associations are not saving enough in reserves even for normal replacements, let alone for property defects.  When it comes to defective flashing, this means potential leaks.  If the defect has gone unremediated for the last 10+ years, that could mean mold or structural damage.  Identifying this damage is generally beyond the scope of normal home inspectors and requires invasive testing.  My two cents is to figure out exactly who identified these repairs, what work was done, if any, and how much the cost to repair is.  I'd probably walk on this property.  I'd be happy to talk more about this and could probably convey more info through a phone call if you want to PM me, I'd be happy to chat.  I'd also love to give you my general warnings about community living with respect to reserve savings accounts and how the majority of associations are just playing hot potato and some unlucky homeowners are going to get stuck footing some large bills.  I didn't do a very good job of keeping this brief."
RealEstate,3b33fj,prodigy904,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:08:08 2015 UTC,"And when the settlement funds are not enough to cover all the necessary repairs throughout the community?  Even if OP's unit or building isn't affected, it doesn't matter, OP is still part of the association and when the shortfall is determined, it is split between every owner in the HOA.  Could be a very expensive endeavor."
RealEstate,3b2f29,LostEnchanter,3,Thu Jun 25 12:38:38 2015 UTC,The best advice I give my clients when putting an offer in on a house/condo in high demand is to remove your financing condition. Get pre-qualified from the bank ahead of time so you know 100% that you will get the financing needed to close on your purchase. By having as little conditions as possible the sellers (or the bank) may favor your offer as there are less ways for you to escape from the deal before closing. If you know it's a fixer-upper and are prepared to do renovations remove your home inspection condition (or reword it so it can't be used as an escape clause). This works for my clients 9/10 times. Only time it doesn't work is when someone with deep pockets outbids everyone and pays well over market value.   Good luck!

But this is fairly common- especially with FHA. In neither case would I recommend your father in law pay for the work unless it's minor (like fixing a handrail) and he's willing to lose that money.   The two options that are most commonly followed are (1) escrow holdback - say the repairs are $3000. Your FIL puts up $3000 + buffer into an escrow account and promises to have the work completed in xx days, or the lender will take the money out of the escrow and pay their own contractor to complete it, or (2) have the seller make the repair. In a short sale, typically (1) happens."

Those deals can fall apart for many reasons that are no fault of anyone, so even though it can look like a sure thing, it's not.   Lenders will not loan on homes that don't meet GSE minimum property standards/requirements. That's why many short sales and REOs sell for cash (at a significant discount). Because no one will loan on them.   There are a lot of investors on this board who use hard money lenders to buy places. The rates can be pretty steep but you only need that for a short time, you buy it, fix it up and then sell it or refi into traditional financing. So that may be an option for your FIL.   Basically the bank who is selling the house has an asset that is likely only worth ""wholesale"" but they would be thrilled to have someone pay ""retail"" for it. Don't let that person be your FIL."

He's screwed out of the money. In additional to that problem, what happens if his contractors accidentally damage the property?  I agree with Lerk. You are probably getting a short version of the story: seller's bank approves short sale; buyer's lender says X must be fixed before closing or you don't get the money; seller (who is not the bank, btw) doesn't have money to fix X but says ""fine, why don't you fix it before closing??""

It doesn't matter if paint is chipping, it typically must be remediated (removed) if original lead-based paint was used, even if it's been painted over.   Why? The whole reason we know that lead-based paint retards child development is because it was originally used in low-income housing where hungry kids lived. Unfortunately, lead-based paint is sweet in flavor & sadly, children figured out it was palatable when there was no other food available. It makes complete sense that especially Section 8 housing demands the testing & removal of lead based paint."

You can still get a lead hazard from paints that are not considered lead-based (1mg/cm2 by XRF or 0.5% lead by weight) if they are in bad condition.   The numbers you are looking for depend on the location of the sample. The inspector should have taken dust wipe samples from 1) floor 2) window sill 3) window well in each room.   Clearance levels are: 40ug/ft2 for floor, 250 for window sill, and 400 for window well.   Just because lead-based paint (LBP) is present doesn't mean it is a hazard. It is when the paint is in poor condition. The wipes should give more information as to whether any LBP has been flaking or brushing off at friction surface (window sashes, door frames/jambs, stair treads, etc).

If you are going to have an escrow account through your lender they will put the seller portion in the escrow account. The property tax bill is sent out in October and the mortgage company will pay it end of December.  You should look up the 2015 assessed value on county appraisal district site to double check they are using the right estimate of taxes. If the value went way up this year that means the estimate will be low. If that happens, the lender will send you an escrow adjustment letter next spring adjusting your payment upward. If you don't have escrow I guess you get a check, not sure there but I would definitely check what the assessed value for 2015 is. Source: Property tax appraiser"

RealEstate,3b4tnb,minze,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:37:23 2015 UTC,It's usually the opposite.  Usually yearly taxes are paid at the start of the year so the seller most likely paid $13k for this year's tax bill.  the seller is now selling in (lets say) July.  So they paid taxes for July-Dec for a house they won't own anymore.  At closing the buyer will need to pay the seller roughly $6500 for 6 month's of property tax.  You'll most likely also need to pre-pay next year's taxes as well so the bank has the money ready in escrow when the time comes.
RealEstate,3b4tnb,Royal1k,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:05:44 2015 UTC,"You will receive a prorated property tax credit from the seller based on the time frame that they have owned the home.  The prorated tax credit will be listed in the 200s section of your HUD-1 settlement statement, offsetting your overall ""Cash due from buyer"".  Most likely the proration will be based on the certified tax values from 2014 since the 2015 taxes are still estimates at this point in the year.  However, your purchase contract will likely include a clause that says if the taxes end up being different than the estimates used for the proration, both parties agree to make up the difference.  It's rarely done, but something that is within your right and outlined in the contract."

RealEstate,3b2ssn,PeteDub,6,Thu Jun 25 18:22:48 2015 UTC,I don't see how that could possibly be true.  A seller's market doesn't miraculously give the buyer the ability to afford more. OP was essentially writing checks that he couldn't cover.

If you and your agent believe the appraisal was flawed, the lender has a process in place where you can provide better comps. You need to say why they are more appropriate,  not just higher.   I think your agent did mis-advise you. Appraisers are required to appraise to ""market value"" which is defined by the GSEs as ""most probably price absent undue influence."" A bidding war does not meet this definition and no one should expect an appraisal to come in at crazy prices like that.   As a public service announcement here, don't waive appraisal contingencies unless you're prepared to walk away from your earnest money.   I would appeal to the seller's broker, if they've got other offers and can still make a sale on the place they may agree to release your earnest money, even if they had a case for holding onto it. Good luck."
RealEstate,3b2ssn,lazinase,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:53:35 2015 UTC,"You are probably right in that the financing contingency will protect you. Lenders will refuse to fund anything over the appraised value most of the time. If thats the case (and the seller won't lower the price), then your banker can issue you a document stating why you were unable to obtain financing. This will protect your earnest money  The seller really should lower the price. Their agent should advocate that as well. Appraisal is the appraisal, there rarely is any arguing with it."

Is it more expensive for you to buy a pricier house with perhaps a newer roof, or more expensive to keep the house and replace the roof. If those numbers end up being close, I'd keep the house with the old roof, and replace it in 5-15 years depending.   I'd only get rid of the bad roof house if it is prohibitively more expensive to keep that house and replace the roof than it is to get a different house."

Utah has three tab shingles and they flew off like crazy, our wind is really bad up here sometimes. I replaced them myself last year with Architectural shingles.   My experience is shitty installers, swamp cooler and water, and I think they shingled them in the winter and it did not allow for them to really adhere to each other. If done right three tabs can last for awhile.  Get a roofer up there to get a real appraisal of the roof and then make your decision. 500 bucks to walk away, no big deal considering I did my roof myself for $2500."

Not everyone is comfortable with working on a roof and if that is not you then the cost of the roof at least doubles as now you will have to pay someone else ($5000 at least). Also, are you handy and able to strip a roof and replace it to code?   Make sense a little bit, sorry if I am confusing."

There is a way to make some MLS systems do a tax record search for properties meeting your criteria that sold in a certain time range.

RealEstate,3b3hho,TallKappa,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:43:31 2015 UTC,No ones responded so I'll add my two cents. Check the registry of deeds. There should be information on there about the tax lien and other liens that may exist.   It sounds like he may owe a significant amount of money to liens and maybe his mortgage. If they go unpaid the home will be auctioned and the liens still need to be paid but it's more than likely the mortgage will not go to the new owner.   Keep an eye out for short sales or this building showing up in the classifieds wig an auction date in a local paper. You may want to have a frank discussion with the current owner to ask these questions.

RealEstate,3b2y8f,landofmisfits,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:51:01 2015 UTC,At the sale of the first condo the bank calls the mortgage and you have to pay it off.  Hopefully you net enough from the sale that you don't have to add any funds out of pocket.
RealEstate,3b2y8f,landofmisfits,2,Fri Jun 26 02:07:58 2015 UTC,"I just went through the research process myself (I'm in Arlington and have a 2-family there.)  First of all start by calling a real estate lawyer.  They won't charge you anything to just discuss the general process.  I believe you need to pay for a survey, an architect's diagram, and all the legal paperwork such as condo fees.  My lawyer gave me a ballpark amount for the whole thing at $10k.  Basically get your paperwork ready, put it on the market as condos, when the first one closes then you file all the paperwork officially and pay off the loan with the proceeds of the sale.  If you owe more than the proceeds of one sale then you may need to front cash until the next condo sells because your lender will call the loan on that first sale.  Also at least here I don't think the town cares if we condo it.  They just need the appropriate paperwork.  Even though we could net more money we're busy with kids and I don't think we're going to bother.  An agent we talked with said only about 5-10% of people in our situation go through the condo process.  Hope that helps.  PM me if you want the name of the lawyer I talked to."
RealEstate,3b2y8f,wanderingtroglodyte,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:07:06 2015 UTC,"I can't speak specifically to Boston, but in general, the first thing that you would do is check with local zoning to see if this is even allowed in the area.  If so, then you need to submit plans for the division of the real estate, those will have to be approved, separate tax values will have to be assessed, separate parcel ID's created by the county, and on and on and on.  You will have to create a condo association and documents that addresses all of the common areas and exterior building maintenance, as well as what the rules and responsibilities for the association are and what the rules and responsibilities for the individual owners are.  This is no means a comprehensive list of all that needs to be done, but merely a starting point.  This is not common or cost effective for just a 2 unit building and could significantly reduce market value of the property versus leaving it as a duplex."

RealEstate,3b26yr,zooch76,2,Thu Jun 25 13:12:18 2015 UTC,"I gotta side with the developer on this one. Don't agree to things in writing if you don't plan to stick to them. He thinks (and he's a developer so this is his line of work and I expect he will know) that vinyl siding looks cheap and will devalue the neighborhood.

RealEstate,3b37rs,DaveInPhilly,3,Thu Jun 25 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"Hello Dave.  I'm a loan officer in the North East.  I do not believe Vantage Point and Keller Williams have any direct relationship because Keller's in-house mortgage lender is CitiMortgage.  It could be that the real estate agent you are using has a relationship with the loan officer or branch manager at Vantage Point.  It does not surprise me that they are quoting you higher rates.  Most likely their rates are higher because they have ""captive business"" from the realtor (meaning they are not expecting clients that come from Keller to ""shop around"".)  You definitely will not mess anything up by shopping around.  In fact, even if you have them run your credit, it will not lower your score as long as they pull it within 45 days of Vantage Point originally running credit.  It's always a good idea to shop around.  And if the home you're purchasing is in NY, NJ or CT (the states I'm licensed in), let me know and I'll tell you where I'm seeing rates today for your particular loan scenario.  Hope this helps."
RealEstate,3b37rs,FirstCTLend,2,Thu Jun 25 18:11:13 2015 UTC,"Rates that are publicly advertised are always going to be best case scenario. That is not a good way to shop around. If you are shopping around, compare quotes you are reviving specific to your situation.   Publicly quoted rates are typically based on a scenarios with every factor being the most favorable possible. For example 800 FICO, 40% loan to value etc.  Rates are also not the most important thing in your transaction. What is important is the competence of your loan officer and the service he/she provides. Mortgage transactions are tricky - you need an LO with experience and you trust. Typically, the lenders with super low rates are not the best service oriented companies to work with.  Good luck"
RealEstate,3b37rs,fish1oop,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:10:25 2015 UTC,"It doesn't hurt to see what's out there before you go under contract. However, remember that ""rate"" is not the only important thing. Are the rates you're seeing on those websites loaded with fees? Is there a little asterisk someplace that only indicates that's the lowest rate available and not necessarily what they can offer to you? Do they require a stupid high credit score? Is there a local human being who knows your situation that you can go to his office if you have a problem?"
RealEstate,3b37rs,ShortWoman,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:41:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. We are fortunate to have one of those stupid high credit scores and as far as I can tell, these sites are reporting Rate, APR, and fees, I have know idea how accurate they are, but I understand that both Zillow and Bank Rate are on the up and up.   There is actually a local mortgage company that my coworker used and recommends highly. That's the first place I would like to check.   I just remember there being something when we refinanced our house that warned us not to do something before we closed (inquiries, applications or something like that) because it would send up red flags. I just don't want to screw anything up.   The rate our mortgage guy gave us today is 4.125% and it looks like there are a bunch of other folks <4%."
RealEstate,3b37rs,Royal1k,2,Thu Jun 25 18:10:10 2015 UTC,"Likely won't hurt anything but I would be cautious with any online lenders.  There's something to say about a loan officer that is endorsed by your realtor.  Chances are they refer to this loan officer because they know they will get you to the closing table on time.  When you go rogue with an unknown entity or someone outside of your market area, you're always running the risk of someone dropping the ball and possibly blowing up your whole purchase.  Again, it can't hurt to shop around but keep in mind the ultimate goal of making it to closing and buying your new home."
RealEstate,3b37rs,Royal1k,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:05:12 2015 UTC,"I actually only got a slightly lower rate shopping around. My initial quote was 4.125%, I got quotes for 3.99% and 3.875%. I gave both to the guy I had been working with. He was able to match the 3.99, but not the 3.875%, but he was able to get the fee (which had been $499) waived. I decided to take the higher rate because, as you said, he is a known quantity and my realtor is comfortable with him.   Thank again for your advice."

""Corner lots are undesireable to many buyers"" is also standard advice.  It's also possible that if the lot is ""unique"" for the neighborhood (not just in size, but other attributes) he could be worried about finding comps or the house appraising correctly.  ""Don't buy it because it has the largest lot"" is just strange."

RealEstate,3b2si5,nofishies,2,Thu Jun 25 19:32:44 2015 UTC,"I think the problem is more that it's a weird corner lot with no direct water access.  That would put off a lot of buyers - they'd rather have a regular but smaller lot with privacy and road on only one side given the choice.  If it was a bigger but similar lot but otherwise equivalent then that's a significant bonus for most people, especially since the yards in your subdivision are pretty tiny.  But yeah, if you want to charge a large premium for the extra land then it might be a smaller pool of buyers for similar house/same street/same school district - you have the classic best house on the street problem."
RealEstate,3b2si5,lunapo,2,Thu Jun 25 16:21:33 2015 UTC,It is harder to find comps if you are more then 15% more expensive than your neighborhood. If its in that range it is less of an issue.

I wouldn't say that at all- maybe it's a reason to look a little closer but passing all together is extreme.   You should always have an older house inspected before you take ownership. Get it checked for termites/ mold/ structural issues etc by a GOOD inspector with good references. DON'T CHEAP OUT ON THIS. It'll cost you some money but save you FAR more in the long run.

Now two years later I'm still in a legal battle over 200.000 in damages that we discovered a few months after moving in. Brand new roof, new outer wall panels, new foundation and new bathroom all done in a way that's not according to building code and not likely to last.

Your #3 house will not magically grow more lipstick; you need to put it on yourself.

RealEstate,3b09v3,Improvised0,6,Thu Jun 25 06:44:42 2015 UTC,"In a market like Toronto, it's not uncommon to see a home hit the market at a low price with a note on the listing saying that agents are  only accepting offers next Saturday. This gives it a week of exposure and creates a bidding war. For example: a million dollar home, listed at 750k, creates a lot of interest because it's the lowest priced in the neighbourhood. Next week, the offers will come in at say, 750, 850 and 950k. The agent then goes back to all offers and says ""we have multiple offers, and we're considering yours but it's low, if you resubmit a higher offer I'll present it to my client. I can't tell you what the magic number will be but I can say that it will need to have seven digits"". The hope is that the buyers get emotionally attached to the outcome and overbid. You could really list a property at 1 cent and let the market take over. This of course only works in a hot sellers market, with a shortage of homes, like Toronto. Of course, the seller isn't obligated to accept any of the offers."

RealEstate,3b09v3,dkm60,5,Wed Jun 24 23:13:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your reply.  We looked at comps to set the price originally and this seemed to be in line.  This is one of the bigger houses around so the picture was a bit less clear.  Agent has only suggested lowering the price.  I don't know if it's staged properly, how would I tell?  We are living there and I have three kids so it's not staying pristine at all times, but is generally clean and tidy.  Turn offs: maybe having our stuff in the house?  The only negative feedback we've gotten was that they didn't like the back yard (pool, no lawn), so that could be a turn off.  Not sure what else to look for or think of..."

RealEstate,3b09v3,wamazing,11,Thu Jun 25 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"erroneous. Clutter matters and the agent is very likely asking for a reduction out of necessity.  There are volumes of data used to show that market performance peaks in the first week or two, and then about 3 weeks into the listing it falls off the face of the earth unless you change something.  I'm betting that's why your agent is suggesting a reduction, though you're way beyond a strategic price reduction time frame IMO.    For the record, a smaller house with with three kids is almost guaranteed to be on the ""lived in"" side of the spectrum, no matter what you do.  This actually has a big impact from my experience, on this sort of value it could be a $10K impact depending on how the clutter effects the first impression.  Pair that issue with a pool lot that has no yard (if that's a fair description) and an otherwise aggressive listing price, and it isn't surprising that you're not selling. Keep in mind, in much of San Diego if your price is around 2-3% of what the market will support, you'll likely get an offer to start negotiations.  If you're priced higher than that, I find that people will sit back and wait for the price reduction, the so-called ""blood in the water"".  Your reduction should be a good $20K+ if you want to salvage the performance.  For you, a price reduction is your only real option (other than canceling and re-listing).  On a stale listing, the agent is pretty limited in the activities he/she can do to increase visibility, and they're marginal improvements at best.  Sending mail, door knocking, networking, open houses, broker caravan, etc. are all small increases in a marketing plan. Hopefully he/she did these when you launched...  Collectively they're worth doing, but without question, the most likely method of finding a buyer is the MLS. Unfortunately, there are very real reasons why you need to hit the market priced right, so that your MLS exposure is maximized. Many agents don't have their automated searches setup properly, many are poor at monitoring their hot lists, and so unfortunately at this point even a price reduction will have limited impact as some potential agents/buyers won't even see the price change.  Moreover, adding to the headache, you're likely pretty desperate, and desperation never bodes well during negotiations...  Try and hold some open houses (with different agent holding them open to appear fresh), you could cancel and re-list (thought it doesn't fool the good agents), or have your agent do more door knocking around your home.  Second to the MLS in finding your buyer is proximity advertising.  Finding a neighbor who rents and wants to buy in the neighborhood, someone looking for a friend/family member to move closer, even someone looking for a nearby investment...  Good luck!    Edit: What people need to understand is that this all boils down to leverage.  Someone could come along in a month and make an offer.  But, without any buzz, that person can flex their position and stand their ground.  Granted, so can the Seller, but it boils down to whether or not the Seller wants to sell this season."

If it's priced right and in an area people are looking at then it should be getting more than 12 showings in two months. Either it's priced too high or your realtor isn't advertising it enough. Is it on Zillow/Trulia/etc? Have they held an open house?   Aside from price I'd say the pool taking up most of the yard space is going to be a problem for a lot of houses in CA with the drought happening.

Sometimes SOMETIMES you can retake pictures and simply relist at the same price to generate some interest, however the buyers on your bracket are all already there.

You can use $/SF if you keep the comparison to homes within 10% of your size, similar ages, single story to single story etc. It's easy to get an apples to oranges comparison going and then wonder what is going on.   The other suggestion I'd have is check out the competition.

Hard to say exactly without knowing your area and seeing your house. But you get to a point of diminishing returns if the house is large and the land is large, people might pay for one or the other but the more features you have, the more likely it is that someone with that budget would rather have a smaller or average house in a nicer neighborhood, for the same price.

So no thanks.   BUT as a seller, you have to consider the possibility that this is going on. Look at the comps on the market for your exact same price. Are they in a better neighborhood? Better defined as any combination of newer, better quality, better location. That might be very telling."

RealEstate,3b09v3,dkm60,2,Thu Jun 25 05:02:21 2015 UTC,"We would need to see it to make a better judgement but:  find the demographic of your area, for some reason some people don't do this. IE is it a student area? People go for the schools? Horses? Beach?  You say you and your family are living there. This can make it hard to setup. People wanting to move in soon will be wary. People who want to find a rental will be trumped off.  Even in hot markets if you have a high price tag you can sell it.  A good stager will set it up to appeal to your houses demographic.  Things you can do before selling it at a lower price:  1) Paint and do minor repairs on any areas that look bad including figures and the outside. You can paint yourself.  2) sell some of the stuff you don't need, if you're moving anyways might as well do it sooner rather than later.   3) no mess, no toys around. You set it up so it looks like it's staged. Yes live there but make sure it's not cluttered.   The reason people pay more for a house, is because it is a home. No matter what anyone tells you most people have little imagination and when they see worn out carpet and paint that is 3-4 years old they see work many don't want to do and not a home.  You know the kind of people who see past and don't need staging? Investors. They're looking for a good deal. It's rare to get an investor to pay a ""home"" price.  In addition your house has been on the market too long. Check that along with MLS your home is on other websites and not just remax or whatever.  Staged homes on average sell for more.  Doing it yourself and a few minor changes won't hurt. Hell take it off the market for a bit. Spend a thousand or so on painting it and staging it and then put it back on with recently renovated. Tear up carpet and reveal wood, replace anything broken bam.  Summary:  Two basic things you can do:  1) decrease cost of house 2) increase perceived value."

RealEstate,3b14gc,olyfrijole,24,Thu Jun 25 03:09:45 2015 UTC,"It's my company policy to NEVER allow pre-posession of a home. Ever. That's how strongly I feel about it & how often I've seen things go wrong. Also, your MIIL should go sign documents if she wants any leverage in negotiations. She needs to fulfill her side of the terms of the contract if she expects to have the other side do the same.   Tl;dr: Go sign. No pre-posession.  EDIT for clarification: Seller should sign the closing documents, not anything else she hasn't had reviewed by an attorney/her agent."
RealEstate,3b14gc,ShinyLightning,5,Thu Jun 25 03:34:21 2015 UTC,Agree 100% with both points here.  <- 13 year agent.
RealEstate,3b14gc,moleculoso,3,Thu Jun 25 03:46:34 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing your experience. That's how I felt about the pre-possession, but I'm not clear why she should still sign the title docs if her buyer isn't funding at that point. Just to retain the buyer's earnest money as remedy? Or does the action of her signing the docs force the buyers to proceed in some other way?"
RealEstate,3b14gc,ShinyLightning,9,Thu Jun 25 03:46:35 2015 UTC,"You can't give the buyers any reason so point the finger & go, ""Hey! They aren't following the rules so we don't have to either!"" And yes, if you hope to retain the earnest money for your time/trouble, you are typically only entitled to it if you fulfill your obligations for your side of the transaction."
RealEstate,3b14gc,alchemy3083,5,Thu Jun 25 03:50:46 2015 UTC,"So close is 6/25 and your MIL gets an extra day of possession?  Is she already moved or just ready to move?  Does the Purchase Agreement make closing contingent on the seller's purchase of the other home?  It seems like the obvious thing to do is for your MIL to just go to closing and follow through with the prior agreement.  If the buyer thinks they can't close tomorrow, they get to be the ones to come up to the closing table and tell the title company they changed their minds about the whole thing.  The buyers are motivated to close ASAP because they want the house and if the deal falls through they have to start all over somewhere else.  Allowing them early occupancy removes much of that urgency to fix things on their side.  Allowing them early occupancy also doesn't do anything that would solve the problem about the buyers being unable to sell their old home.  All it does is turn the buyer's inconvenience into your MIL's inconvenience.  And perhaps, a complete nightmare for her if things go south.  Tell your MIL to pass papers and refuse any last-minute requests like pre-possession.  If the buyers declare they won't sign, in front of the title company, lender, realtors, and God, that's on them."

I did a pre-close occupancy as the buyer on my last house.    I have a family with three kids, and really didn't want to do a double move when we moved to a new city for my wife's new job... but the mortgage company needed verification of my wife's new employment after she was already working in the new city.  I told the seller, ""here's what's up.  If you rent to us for two months as pre-close occupancy prior to date of closing... I'll put up $10,000 in earnest money.""  They accepted, 45 days later I closed, everyone was happy."

RealEstate,3b0am5,thezarape,5,Wed Jun 24 22:58:56 2015 UTC,"This is so very region specific it's hard to answer... but I'll do the best I can. I have 7 rental properties listed on AirBNB (and other vacation rental sites). Three of these are homes in a ski town and four of these are apartments in Buenos Aires.  I'm seeing an average return of 10-15% on the Buenos Aires apartments. There are a lot of tourists who visit the city, and 90% of my bookings are from the US, Brazil and Europe.  I listed on AirBNB 4 years ago and have good positioning on the site. This is important as they now have over 4000 listings in Buenos Aires alone. I am not sure how a new listing would do in the current market. It's also seasonal with most bookings coming in September - May. We have had to lower rates this year due to a decrease in tourism and the increased competition on the site.  The three properties in the ski resort area do much better. Returns are closer to 30-40% with ski season being peak, but summer rentals improving due to increased mountain biking expansion at the local resort and other summer activities. AirBNB generates about half the bookings for these with the rest coming from HomeAway/VRBO.  It's a lot of work. This started as a hobby, but is now about 60% of what I do. It's tiring work and often frustrating. While the Buenos Aires apartments are low maintenance (booked to 2-4 people), the ski homes see a lot more wear and tear. I book those to large groups (20+ people) and there is a lot more to do after each rental. Furniture has about a 2-3 year life span. Wine glasses, plates, silverware, coffee makers, etc need to be replaced yearly. Things break all the time, pipes freeze, the toilets get clogged, and on and on. I have a maintenance guy who checks the house weekly and is on call. I have a hot tub maintenance guy. I have cleaners. I have a trash guy. I have a landscaper. I have a painter.  As for the bookings, they all take time. There is a lot of back and forth regarding the property, rates, amenities, payment, etc. As I have done this more full-time, I have gotten more organized. I pay $160/year for Docusign and send all rental agreements for e-signature. I get payments through credit card 95% of the time. (I prefer HomeAway to AirBNB as I get a 50% deposit immediately and can dictate my own cancellation terms. AirBNB's cancellation policy favors the renter not the owner IMHO and you do not get paid until 1 day after the guest checks in.)  I have a good accountant after getting hit a few years ago with not paying a lodging tax and finding myself owing the state $15,000. I have a separate LLC for each property, which means separate bank accounts, expense reporting, tax returns, etc. I put everything into QuickBooks each month and balance the bank accounts.  I adjust rates all the time to maximize bookings. I change prices weekly to try and fill last minute spots. I post advertisements on Craigslist as well.  I pay over $2500/year for a short-term commercial rental insurance policy after finding out that homeowners and normal landlord policies do not cover short-term vacation rentals. (A friend was sued when a guest fell through a bunk bed and his homeowners company refused to pay. He was out $40,000 before even getting to arbitration.)  Whew... TMI?  Like I said, it's a lot of work. It does make a nice return, and I'll probably keep doing it for the foreseeable future adding a house every few years. I'm even considering forming an investment group to buy more properties sooner.  Doing one house is a lot easier, but many of the same things will happen and if you're working a fulltime job, it's a lot to take on.  Hope that helps..."
RealEstate,3b0am5,mccomb,2,Thu Jun 25 14:39:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time and making this elaborate answer. It gives me a pretty good idea of what its like to do this in the US.  The reason I´m asking is because we´re working on a development in Baja California Sur which is targeted for people that want a vacation home in a very nice place called La Ventana that is full of sustainable activities (kiteboarding, mountain bike, scuba diving, spearfishing, hot springs, etc.) and are also interested on having a good ROI for the rentals (which we´ll manage and do all marketing, accounting, and other stuff for owners)."
RealEstate,3b0am5,mccomb,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:12:11 2015 UTC,You have a much different situation then. It sounds a lot more like the condo-hotel business. You sell the units and then take a management fee. The benefit you have is that owners have to cover expenses and you also get a cut of the rentals in return for managing them. The owner has a hands off investment that hopefully returns some money.

RealEstate,3b0am5,InHartWeTrust,2,Wed Jun 24 23:35:45 2015 UTC,"I just have a feeling we're setting up for another big real estate market correction soon due to this for a couple reasons.   First, just about everyone I know is talking about investing in RE and it seems like, whenever everyone (the layman) is talking about doing something, too many hands are in the pie and it's ripe to pop.   Secondly, where has real estate been been not increasing or dropping rapidly lately? Outside of a few usual suspects like Detroit, most places I hear people talk about seem to come with the statement, ""Prices have gone up over the last few years."" If the vast majority of prices and rents are going up, it seems to me that it's a bubble.   Lastly, the Fed injected MASSIVE amounts of liquidity into the mortgage markets during the crisis and banks are back, in many cases, to heavy lending. This propped up prices, but salaries haven't kept up with that inflation.   TL;DR: I think we're in another bubble market, both for rents and for prices. Rents might hang in for the most part, as AirBnB has gained in popularity and provided alternatives to the normal hotel, but they're certainly not overly rational."
RealEstate,3b0am5,tonguepunch,3,Thu Jun 25 12:36:31 2015 UTC,"If the vast majority of prices and rents are going up, it seems to me that it's a bubble.   Property is supposed to appreciate, only in some areas are the appreciation rates ""alarming"".  Also, lending is still strict.  Interest rates are beginning to rise too, which will again make it more difficult for people to get financing."
RealEstate,3b0am5,cworxnine,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"Property is supposed to appreciate,   This isn't necessarily true. This site talks about historical increases and if you scroll down you'll see this quote:  ""You might be more interested to know that the average annual home price increase for the U.S. during the whole 1900 - 2012 period was only 3.1%/year -- just a shade better than the inflation rate of 3.0%/year.""  So, if housing has appreciated as much as it has recently, yet the average is just 0.1% over inflation, there has to have been many down years in the average.   TL;DR: Housing has, historically, been a very poorly performing investment."
RealEstate,3b0am5,tonguepunch,2,Thu Jun 25 13:37:23 2015 UTC,"You do realize if a property goes up 3.1%, the cash on cash return is 5x that number with a 20% down loan? Then there's equity paydown, annual depreciation write offs and the ability to 1031 exchange the profit and defer capital gains tax.  But lets pretend theres no leverage/loans, tell someone who's bought 100 foreclosed homes and 2x their asset value while collecting rent monthly, that housing is a poor investment.  It takes above average intelligence and execution, but to say its always poor investment is a poor choice of words."

Then there's equity paydown, annual depreciation write offs and the ability to 1031 exchange the profit and defer capital gains tax.   I understand the principles of leverage and tax benefits and give that they do play into returns. I might have needed to adjust my wording to state that personal home investment is not meant to be the boon that it has been as of the last 20+ years.    It takes above average intelligence and execution, but to say its always poor investment is a poor choice of words.   Again, I admit I should have been more specific. I actually have a handful of rentals of my own that have solid ratios of rents:purchase price and most properties I've purchased have unlevered gross rental payoffs in under 5 years. Costs (taxes and insurance) are relatively low. I was able to take advantage of a market inefficiency, which is mostly gone, as my latest was up to 6.5 years. But, I believe in the area and it was a more complete and higher end finish than normal.   Anyway, I guess I'm saying I agree with you in some sense, or I obviously would not have invested in SFRs myself. That said, I think a majority of people look at the last 20 years of price and rent appreciation and neglect to look further into the past and at the bigger picture. When I start to hear the Average Joe on the street decrying the positives of real estate investment, especially in properties and areas in which they know little about, I start to get wary.   I become especially wary when taking the larger macroeconomic view of the unprecedented low rates of the last 15 years, the propping up for the market by the Fed, and the gains that have occurred. But, nothing says I'm right; just my take on it."
RealEstate,3b0am5,tonguepunch,2,Thu Jun 25 17:09:18 2015 UTC,"Correct, long term appreciation is 3% (5% is high end).  But, the high appreciation rates we are seeing are relative to the market rates coming off of a trough in the cycle as a result of the bubble that did burst in the late 2000's.  I don't disagree with you that values are on the rise and it's undoubtedly a sellers market (and it doesn't help that new investors are paying way more than they should be due to stupidity), I just think we are in a normal growth stage between Phase 2 and 3 in the cycle, not butting up against a bubble that's about to burst:  http://www.dce.harvard.edu/sites/dce.harvard.edu/files/images/temp/Real%20Estate%20Cycle%20Quandrants%20-%2018-Year%20Real%20Estate%20Cycle.JPg  Realistically, no one knows and we could go back and forth for days.

But, the high appreciation rates we are seeing are relative to the market rates coming off of a trough in the cycle as a result of the bubble that did burst in the late 2000's.   I guess, IMHO, I feel like this bubble ""burst,"" but it has been inflated to such a great level, that it only really deflated to an already high level. Sure, in some extreme areas (I'm thinking Vegas, Central Valley, and Florida type locales), there were huge declines. But, in many areas, declines were more reasonable and the levels fallen too were high by historical standards.   I guess I just have trouble wrapping my head around the huge growth seen in property values over the last few years. I get low bond rates have investors looking for better returns (with RE being similar to bonds), I understand globalization bringing in foreign investors, and that demand has increased in urban areas.   That said, the levels by which prices have increased relative to salaries in so many areas has be a bit baffled. I get inflation has a lull when it comes to salaries, but affordability in so many areas has declined drastically and portion of income spent in rents/mortgages has increased quite a bit compares to historical norms and I just wonder what's next.   Anyway, I definitely have more, but I need to run and don't wanna lose replying at all. Thanks for the discussion!"
RealEstate,3b0am5,tonguepunch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:32:54 2015 UTC,"Housing has, historically, been a very poorly performing investment   Um...this average also takes into effect the broad market.  Averaging between San Francisco and Detroit you will probably come close to 3%, however real estate is VERY regional.  I would say that real estate has historically been a very safe investment depending on your location."
RealEstate,3b0am5,lumpytrout,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:51:27 2015 UTC,"I guess I should have clarified as a personal investment (ie, getting rich off your own personal residence), housing has not historically been a stellar investment in comparison to other avenues.    I would say that real estate has historically been a very safe investment depending on your location.   I would say TIMING is more important than location. You couldn't give property away in NYC in for about 20 years from 1960s-1980s in neighborhoods that are now selling properties for $1m for a shell. When those properties were built, they were worth money and, as time passed, they spent decades in the dumps and have only recently come back up in some areas.   Even mentioning Detroit vs San Francisco can also be looked at differently due to timing outside of what we know. When Detroit was one of the fastest growing middle class cities in the U.S. post WWII, values might have fared much better than those of areas we consider highly valued now.   While I certainly agree area-specific can make a difference, there are many variables and it's very cyclical. That's why I don't mind taking the broader picture of RE as an investment; it's more apples to apples when comparisons vs. other options (eg, the S&P)."
RealEstate,3b0am5,tonguepunch,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"Well, timing is also important in the stock market.  If I had invested in the S&P at the peak in 2000ish I would just now be starting to break even.  While in that same period with real estate I've seen some of my properties double in value, all while collecting rent and having a good rate of return.  And unlike stock I can't buy a fixer and put a little sweat equity into it as time allows.  This is really comparing apples to oranges."

While this is certainly true, you're still just taking a snapshot of a period of time where your argument works. This chart is a couple years old, but it still backs up my point. Look at 2000 where you mentioned til 2011 when the chart ends. It never dropped below pre-2000 levels and has rebounded further since 2011.   Again, I'm not saying RE is a shitty investment, per se. Timing, much like the stock market, can skew the performance of your asset greatly. What I'm saying is: to anyone only focusing on the last 20 years, RE has mostly been a boon. However, that's not always the case and, HISTORICALLY, residential real estate does not perform, on average, as well as the stock market and isn't much higher than inflation.   I invest in RE too, so I obviously see its merits. However, many markets have seen 20 years of high price appreciation and, because everything is a cycle, it gives me a little apprehension about diving in too heavily."

I know a couple of agents that do part time but have some exclusives that they can chill on.

RealEstate,3b0vwj,factory81,6,Thu Jun 25 01:57:03 2015 UTC,"I am not a loan expert so maybe someone here can chime in on that end of the deal.   But as an appraiser, I've seen builders do a lot of questionable, if not downright illegal stuff. IMO the main reason they want you to use their lender is because they have a pet appraiser (known to other appraisers in the area as ""Ray Charles"") who will make sure your house appraises for exactly what you need. Funny how that happens.   I've seen faked HUDs, faked comps, all sorts of stuff that should land people in jail at the rate it happens. Not to say all builders are bad news, but, the ones who are, are hard to spot unless you're looking closely. And they all (even the honest ones) have their lawyers who work for them, writing up all the legal lingo you agree to, and it pretty much all favors them. So definitely have an attorney advising you, and get an independent home inspection before you close."
RealEstate,3b0vwj,wamazing,5,Thu Jun 25 02:11:12 2015 UTC,"I am guessing they think they may drag their feet on completing your build and they don't want you to pressure them with the possibility of your loan getting more expensive if they don't finish on time.  The other thing, is that you may be able to afford a $???k house payment at today's interest rate, but if you have to get a new rate in 6 months and the rate has gone up, perhaps you will no longer be able to afford the payment.  Either way, it appears to be protecting them, not that it doesn't help you in the process.  No idea if it is worth the cost for you though."

RealEstate,3b0vwj,nofishies,-1,Thu Jun 25 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"I would venture to guess one of the reasons the rate lock is required is to protect both yourself and the builder against interest rates rising and people no longer qualifying for the house when the construction is complete especially if someone is buying at the top end of their buying power.  A rise in interest rates lowers buying power.  In December my brother purchased a house at a 3.125% interest rate, market rate today is about 1% higher.  That is a 1% rate increase over 6 months, and with this being an election year and the stock market stabilizing at the moment, interest rates are continuing to steadily rise.  No one can read the future, but if it were me, I would lock today's rate and pay the 1/4% to do it based on recent rises.  Edit:  Also, an attorney and independent home inspection is definitely advisable.  Lenders are no longer allowed to specifically choose appraisers, and in fact cannot even talk to an appraiser from the beginning of the process to the end, it is all automated per federal guideline so that there aren't inflated appraisals.  This was more of an issue 5 years or more ago."

IMHO, you are blowing the $1,000 if you do that, you'll be doing the full system in a few years after you realize what it's costing you in rent every month.   Get a few more quotes, look at any tax incentives you might qualify for. Finance it if you have to (think you can write off the interest if you are renting this out) and just do it right."

RealEstate,3b03xd,blackmoon76,2,Thu Jun 25 01:28:45 2015 UTC,Sorry for the lack of details i am in FL. I have received 2 so far. Both within a few hundred from each other. We ended up spending 400 on a few cheaper window units as its too hot to go without for a few days.  The issue is the coils are impacted and there is a freon leak. They said to replace the coil on an older unit is around 2k. And to clean and recharge and hope they fix the leak but no guarantee would be 550.  We are in the process of closing on our house in the next 3 weeks so I do not want to put out 5k down in a house I know will be vacantish for 2 months while I move and  rehab and get ready to rent.  My thoughts are for now if the window units do ok. I may knock 50/MO or so off the rent and try to rent it as I am not 100% sure I want to be a landlord and am only committed to trying for a year.  Anyways I will welcome feedback. I know standard in FL is central heat and air.

It's worth it to get it from somebody licensed that knows what they're doing. Not to mention how your state views the legality of handling refrigerant when you don't have a license.

RealEstate,3azhfb,juswannalurkpls,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:09:24 2015 UTC,Charlotte NC.  Both BofA and Wells Fargo have shut down complete mortgage locations.  My experience was with 5/3 and was the most ridiculous and unprofessional thing I have ever dealt with.  I am a small business owner in the construction and real estate sector and have been through dozens of loan closings.  When the bottom fell out of the market the banks just got stupid.
RealEstate,3azhfb,underwriter1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:21:17 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I wonder what's behind that or if they just moved operations. The volume of business, in New England at least, is far exceeding the staffing we have.

RealEstate,3azhfb,CptnAlex,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:44:32 2015 UTC,"That's because rates are so low that many banks, especially big banks, are originating loans at an upfront loss. The average cost to a bank to originate is around $5k... Usually only a fraction of this is pushed onto the customer.  Of course, they will make up this loss through selling to the secondary market and/or servicing the loan, but in the short term, their balance sheets are taking a hit.  That means more sales people to originate as much as possible and less staff to do the paperwork."
RealEstate,3azhfb,underwriter1,1 point,Thu Jun 25 12:53:42 2015 UTC,"I've never heard $5K/loan to originate.. do you know why that is (just curious)? We're correspondent and with $1500 processing/UW fee per loan origination the owner profits just on that. Plus his back-end. If we close 1000 loans, make 1.5m, it's more than his overhead costs on staff, materials, rent, etc."
RealEstate,3azhfb,CptnAlex,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:50:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure. I think its based on big banks, which are much more heavily regulated, need to hold more reserve capital, and generally have more staff to pay."

RealEstate,3azhfb,mtrudz,2,Wed Jun 24 23:44:56 2015 UTC,"Over the last few months it's been getting worse. The staff level is stagnant (all the banks are hiring but often hiring from other banks, not bringing new people in, creating a net wash). The loan officers should give you a heads up that it may take xx additional days now to complete the loan process. But often it's a conversation they avoid.  That, no offence to your originator, is the common excuse when they screw up. I know a lot of guys who get busy and forget they leave files on their desk for three weeks- it's easier to blame the 'big bank' than tell the client you misplaced their file. Or forgot to submit docs. In their defense it's really busy."

It's not malicious (or at least not usually, but I've known people to intentionally sabotage things when they were frustrated with their job), just human error that individuals don't/won't admit to for fear of losing their job/retribution.  Which is just dumb, if people are so busy that they're making errors, then there's an obvious issue with the process (overworked, inefficient workflow, etc...) that should be identified.  But, alas, it's the rare business that tries to learn from mistakes made in order to offer a better product.  Thanks again..."

Long story short, there's a lot more paperwork that, through the whole process of the loan, is extremely redundant. So many verifications. So many more re-verifications."
RealEstate,3azhfb,meandrunkR2D2,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:52:08 2015 UTC,"To piggyback of this (industry joke there), not only are we busy, but new regulations force everyone (but especially big banks) to comply, re-comply and re-comply again. No one wants to get sued over a faulty loan, and  those selling to the secondary market want to be sure their paper will be purchased.  That equates to many, many sets of eyes on each loan, which frankly, takes time.  The other side of things is that in many markets, appraisals are taking for.ev.er."
RealEstate,3aydov,imaque,6,Wed Jun 24 14:23:38 2015 UTC,"Often called the ""Know before you owe"" rule. If not already done the effective date has been/will be pushed to Oct. 1 for loans initiated on and after that date.   As just the tip of the iceberg: The rules are intended to protect borrowers so that they receive closing figures sufficiently in advance of closing to review and approve. Among many other changes, the practical problem is that borrowers must see final figures 3 business days before closing. Business days defined as all days except Sundays and national holidays. The closing figures must be hand delivered to the borrower. If not there is an additional 3 day delivery time added (as if it were being mailed). The rule doesn't account for e-mail delivery and the borrower cannot waive this.  So - it looks like all figures must be sent out not less than 6 business days in advance, and many lenders are planning on requiring 10.  Some closing figures can change after the integrated disclosures go out but plan on many last minute postponements of closings, especially in the early months after implementation of this.  Designed to protect consumers it remains to be seen whether they are helped, or severely harmed by this."
RealEstate,3aydov,piratepuppy1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:45:00 2015 UTC,Does it only apply to federally insured mortgages?
RealEstate,3aydov,rugger62,3,Wed Jun 24 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"little knowledge can be dangerous and all but my understanding from googling is:    The TILA-RESPA integrated disclosure (TRID) rule applies to most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. Regulation Z defines the phrase “consumer credit” to mean credit offered or extended to a consumer primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.   I'd take that to many all consumer loans secured by real estate regardless of insurer."
RealEstate,3aydov,NumNumLobster,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:56:58 2015 UTC,the borrower cannot waive this   Ugghhhhh.....  Edit; just I guess to explain my reaction to this is I didn't have final numbers on my house until the day before we closed. I would've hated having to move back numbers because of this.
RealEstate,3aydov,mdconnors,0,Wed Jun 24 19:18:23 2015 UTC,"What's worse is that it isn't clear what happens if something changes at the last minute. Say, for instance, the owner damages the home the day before closing and there isn't time to fix it. Amy credit means a new HUD which means pushing closing."
RealEstate,3aydov,themeatbridge,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:14:31 2015 UTC,"I got way too deep into reading the comments on the delivery/receipt requirement. There was actually pretty thorough discussion of email delivery, and it was a very intentional decision to allow three business days for all methods except in-person delivery. There was some discussion on whether you could reduce the three business day delivery period by having the borrower acknowledge receipt, but it honestly wasn't clear to me whether that was okay."

If any amount of money in the CD is changed, then the closing is automatically pushed back three days.   From what I read today, only three items on the Closing Disclosure must be locked in 3/6 days before closing - that's 3 days if you hand deliver and 6 days if you mail or email. The only things that CANNOT change are APR increase, loan type, and addition of a prepayment penalty. Other items can change within their standard tolerance limits, for example amounts going into escrow can change at any time.  What is interesting is that businesses can't ""early adopt"". This will be a problem for new construction, because we will be using two different systems for quite a while."

Example, a loan officer told me yesterday that once a purchase price is established and the loan applied for, it can't be changed.  What happens if there is a negotiation after inspections, what happens if there is a short appraisal?  So many questions without answers right now.  Hopefully the information sessions help."
RealEstate,3aydov,inphx,2,Wed Jun 24 14:48:47 2015 UTC,"So, if they accidentally quote a low price, apparently tough titties for them.   So this likely means lender fees will be going up across the board in order to account for any accidents, correct?"

Else, the risk is...   Delayed closings, or Clients don't have a chance to negotiate a credit b/c the stagers/movers damaged the property while moving their stuff out and/or the thing that was supposed to be fixed was not fixed, etc, or If they do negotiate and you want to close on time, it'll be a cash in a parking lot shady type thing that officially never happened."
RealEstate,3aydov,aardy,3,Wed Jun 24 19:12:56 2015 UTC,"seems like more or less this is just going to wind up with your historical closing date being a ""ok everyone is happy with this deal, everything is done, no more negotiations can take place after this.  We all good?"" date then a 10 day waiting period following that no?  Annoying as fuck but not the end of the world."
RealEstate,3aydov,Cocktail_shrimp,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:16:32 2015 UTC,"I'm padding a bit with the 10 days.  3 days from when borrower acknowledges receipt of final disclosures is when we can close.   Assume borrower will click on the little 'i got it' thing after midnight 30% of the time, costing a day.  1 day before that it needs to come back from underwriting.  Then assume 40% of the time the realtor will send me the contract addendum on Friday at 6 pm and want to count that as day 1 even though no underwriter is going to be in the office until Monday, at which point the addendum is at the end of the 'to do' list behind things submitted Thursday or Friday during business hours.  Etc."
RealEstate,3aydov,aardy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:19:18 2015 UTC,"Some variations of this is likely.

You talk about the bank wiring funds, and that the checks will come tomorrow (is that now today?).  If a wire was sent yesterday, even after the close of business for the federal reserve, it should arrive this morning. Assuming they sent the correct amount it will all be fine. In my location, you would not have gotten the keys until the mortgagee's money arrived, so the seller must be confident that it will be ok.

As long as the dirt is superficial and not damaging anything (ie: mold, damp etc;) or causing a fire hazard (clutter or rubbish blocking exits) you can't really tell them how clean it needs to be. Especially if there wasn't some kind of upkeep clause in a contract.  If it's just dusty I wouldn't worry about it. If they don't clean when they eventually move then charge them a cleaning fee.  But honestly, dust? That's really not an issue......"
RealEstate,3b0eo4,JoeZee,7,Wed Jun 24 23:31:08 2015 UTC,"I encountered the same. Wrote them an email telling them that the conditions of the house were unacceptable as long-term dirtiness could contribute to disrepair. I gave them a month and came back. It was much cleaner the second time.   However, I've come to realize that you can't police your tenants lives. I haven't been as concerned as I was that first time. I can't check up on them every few months - or rather I won't. When the time comes for them to move out, it's cleaned and repaired or I keep their deposit. I'm not going to worry about it too much until then."

I was a 22 year old bachelor who worked 14 to 16 hours a day, but felt I kept the place pretty clean.   After a week I started coming home to daily notes about how I should do the dishes more often. I was doing them daily when I got home, so he was coming in and seeing the previous night's and that morning's dishes in the sink. That was apparently unacceptable.  I moved out."

If you are not the agent might feel as if you are wasting her time.  Only serious buyers will get pre-approved.

But you also should understand that pre-qualified is just someone telling you over the phone that you can afford this much... Nothing in writing...It never means that you will actually be provided the loan. Unless  you have a pre-approval or a loan commitment a pre-qual means nothing. On the other end, why would you use an agent and not sign a buyers agreement? If you actually read the agreement, you will see that it protects you and gives you fiduciary duties from that agent. Did you know technically by you not having a buyers/agent agreement that you are just a client not a customer. So they have no fiduciary duties to you. That can disclose any information to the seller. If you hate your agent and have a buyers agreement with them, no offense they probably won't like you either and will be glad the cancel the agreement. Interview a few agents before you sign an agreement, but do sign one when you find a competent one. Good luck."

The compensation is determined by the seller and the agent in the listing agreement. There are no laws that state how much that amount is. The sellers agent and the seller then determine how to split said compensation. Say 6% (any number agreed upon between seller and agent). Buyers agent gets 3% sellers agent gets the other 3%. Since you have no control over how the commissions are split and you as the buyer have the money, why not hire someone you like to work for YOU. Remember the seller has nothing without you the buyer."

If you sign an agreement, read it, some agents will require that you make up any commission shortage from the traditional 3% that a seller pays.  For example many foreclosures only pay 2.5% commission, depending on the agreement you sign, you may be on the hook for the other .5%.    Locally exclusive buyer agreements aren't common, once you sign one, it ties you to that agent."

They're choosing to not save for there down payment, a combined income of almost 100k should easily be able to afford a 200k house.  A mortgage with a decent rate would be almost half of their rent, even with utilities and some repairs they're more likely to not be able to afford to rent than buy. Just gotta get that downpayment!  According to the NJ tax calculator I just looked up they're bringing in about $5830/month after taxes. Drop their rent, car payments, and preschool and they're left with 2879.25.  A family of 4 can probably eat on 500/month, lets assume another 100/car/month in gas, and the same for insurance.  That's leaving them with 1979.25...Where is this going?

We need to be providing better quality housing options to the middle classes.  The problem is that the economics of development mean that it's currently only feasible to develop for the very high end (high rents) and very low end (government subsidized) markets. Otherwise it's hard to make the rents cover costs.   There are promising movements towards this. For example high energy efficiency technologies can lower running costs, and factory-built construction methods can lower labor costs.

Where I live, they have targeted certain zipcodes, house types, less than 20 years old, etc.  People who can buy a house, must rent because their selection of houses in their desired area is so limited.  One relative (needing to move to single story for health reasons) had sold their house, and had to rent for over a year before they could find a new home in the area they needed to be in.    Its the new investment model bankers came up with after loosing so much in the mortgage crisis.  Instead of owning a mortgage, they own the actual home.  Bought cheaply, rented out, artificially raising house prices in certain subdivisions/ zip codes by creating scarcity, then sold at the inflated price, or maintained as a rental property for the time being.  They target homes under 20 years old, for reduced maintenance costs.    One single company, American Homes 4 Rent, own over 36,000 homes.  These weren't neglected fixer uppers, but newer homes in good neighborhoods.  If you look at the rental rates, its so much higher than that of a mortgage.

With due respect to the McDowell's whose situation we don't fully understand, obviously, here I go with a totally predictable, curmudgeonly rant.  Where do people get the idea they can have what they want, have kids, live in a desirable place, and then buy a house? (get ready for ""back in my day..."") As a dad of two little ones, I've scraped and clawed since before they were born in order to save for a down payment on a starter house to give our young family some stability. This required big lifestyle changes for my wife and I who had slipped into the ""buy everything you want when you want it"" mentality. It also involved three cross-country moves which each brought a big income bump and introduced us to parts of the country we'd never seen. (spoiler alert: you may have to live in a place WITHOUT an internationally recognized school district for a while.)  Last fall we did manage to take the leap buy a house. We didn't have the 20% down payment we'd have liked, and the house was a little more expensive than we'd have liked, and it needs a little repair here and there, but it has a big yard and it's biking distance to my job and we're pretty darn happy about it.   I feel like the NYT case study and so many others find people who haven't prioritized their life goals to include home ownership and, years down the road when that ship has long sailed, they wail when they realize the consequences of their choices. Are we supposed to feel sympathy? Pity? Anger at an unfair system? I don't know.

RealEstate,3ax7qu,mr_minty_magoo,2,Wed Jun 24 20:33:21 2015 UTC,Totally fair. The trend was toward lower costs and more affordability almost forever. The claim is that this is the first generation who will on average have a lower standard of living than their parents.

While we don't have a societal trend towards downward adjustments (although the middle ages might suggest one), there's plenty of evidence that nature won't let things get too far out of whack and that there's a high likelihood of a temporary correction when a species gets a bit too exuberant."

RealEstate,3ax7qu,ShortWoman,7,Wed Jun 24 11:00:44 2015 UTC,"And where do we get the idea that renting is bad?  I concede that the family in the article was a terrible example. Maybe to some editor at the New York Times, it seems like a terrible tragedy that somebody can't even afford to buy a $200k home. After all, the median home price in NYC is over twice, almost 3 times that. I agree that there's a problem that they can't seem to save the $10k or so that would make an FHA mortgage a possibility (3.5% is $7k, add some for closing costs, not as much cushion as I'd like but it's possible). I further agree that this family made lifestyle choices that make that money hard to save. That has far more important consequences than ""waaah, I can't whim-buy a house.""  However, since they don't own, they don't have to worry about where to find the money for that landscape project he mentions wanting to do on the dream house he'll never buy. For that matter, they don't have to worry about the roof, the water heater, and the HVAC. Because they don't own, they have the ability to pick up and move if the neighborhood turns to crap, the schools don't serve their children's needs, or an Amazing Job Opportunity in another state pops up.   So yeah, I fail to see a problem here."

I am unsure of any rules of the house becomes less valuable. I assume since the city still owns the land they are willing to lose out that way. I think if I were to default the program would get the house and resell it to another person using the program.

RealEstate,3az9w7,Akhaonmeh,3,Wed Jun 24 18:21:20 2015 UTC,"This answer will vary by state but here's what I can tell you about where I work:  Arizona is a non-judicial foreclosure state that allows judicial foreclosure as well. Arizona is also a non-recourse state. This means that if a bank forecloses on a home where the note they are using was the original purchase money mortgage, the bank can only take the home back as the collateral & CANNOT come after the owners for any losses taken on the value of the home. What most people fail to read in our state statutes is that the non-recourse protection only applies if NON-JUDICIAL foreclosure is used.   In many areas where the homes were of great value (ie: millions of dollars) and the banks felt that the owners had simply walked away (thinking they were covered by our non-recourse laws), the banks chose JUDICIAL foreclosure to take the home back, as this method did not limit the banks on how they could pursue the borrower for any losses incurred on the home after the bank repossessed it.   This is why it's of the utmost importance to understand not only your state laws, but also the federal protections (if any) and tax ramifications before making big decisions in real estate. The outcomes can vary greatly & if the professionals you employ do not know the laws, it can have very dire consequences for you."

Either you can negotiate a price reduction that you (and your lender - this may affect the appraised value)  can live with, or you can't. If you can't, and assuming you have a contract that permits you to cancel based on inspection results then you know what to do."

RealEstate,3ayhvh,ShortWoman,5,Wed Jun 24 22:25:01 2015 UTC,"Four layers of roofing material is putting a LOT of stress on the roof framing members. Deflection of rafters/trusses is not uncommon with multi-layer roofs. The framing should be checked out by a structural engineer to determine whether any permanent damage was done.  The new roofing material may indeed cost around $7k. However, you need to factor in the cost of removing all those old layers, hauling all the old materials away, plus the real possibility of needing new sheathing as well. Even on a smaller roof, this could still bring the costs up to $12-13k."
RealEstate,3ayhvh,kegman83,2,Wed Jun 24 23:24:15 2015 UTC,Talk to your mortgage guy before doing anything else. Explain the situation. Let him tell you what options you have that will still allow you to close.

I paid rent for about a year before buying and didn't like someone else profiting off of my money.  Interest rates are historically low, so if someone can buy now, I encourage them to do it, especially if they can throw some extra money toward the principle on the loan.  The equivalent of about 1 extra payment a year, applied toward principle, can knock about 7 years off your loan.    Also, with less than 20% down will require PMI, but if you don't go the FHA route, that comes off at 78% equity, making that extra payment makes that happen much quicker, and he has the benefit of today's interest rates.  Another benefit to owning is that interest on a mortgage is tax deductible, which is a definite benefit for a single person with no dependents."

You'd also have to order your appraisal immediately & pay to have it rushed. It's not possible with some loans, period.  If you're looking for a single-family detached house in our standard market here (ie: under $300k) you should also prepare yourself for a bidding war, as we do not have the supply to meed the current demand.

Get with your realtor and find out where it needs to be priced to sell in the near future, review the comps that he (or she) is basing it off of to insure they are valid, and price it to sell quickly. Even if you have to bring money to the closing table, you'll be better off selling quickly and getting out from under that additional mortgage payment.

We put our house in MLS the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend, had three showings on Sunday, more through the week, two offers by the following Saturday and three more second showing requests.  Unless the old HVAC was non-functional I doubt new HVAC helped at all. Ours is original from 1979.  Priced right, looks great sells fast."

RealEstate,3ay8qo,jl122983,9,Wed Jun 24 13:41:23 2015 UTC,"I think that generally the 30 or 60 day notice go in monthly increments.  So you would be liable for the entire july rent, even if you vacate early.  Notice where it says ""giving a written notice of intention to terminate at least 30 days prior to the date of termination"".  The date of termination would be counted as the last of the month, your notice has to be ""30 days prior to this date"", not ""we'll be out in X days, and I'm not paying for the rest"".  Your landlord may work with you on that.  The specific clause may be buried deeper into the lease.  Also, have you checked that the mold was, in fact mold? Also, are you aware the something like.. 99.5% of mold found in homes is harmless? People see mold and freak out right away, blaming any and all ills on it, when in reality you can just wipe it and spray it with bleach to be done with it.  Are you breaking your lease, even with notice of termination?"

Seeing mold isn't going to get you out of a lease and the potential money you WILL owe when you move out early. According to the lease you signed you will owe rent until someone else rents the apartment (or when the lease actually ends whichever is sooner). That is a very short lease. If the lease was one of mine I would also keep any security deposits you paid due to moving early. The owner may still do this for payment of rent through the terms I listed above were repaid and any other damages that go above that amount you can be billed for.  Not sure about your state laws. Your best bet is to speak with the landlord to get the terms or contact a lawyer (which you won't do because renters never do this lol)."

RealEstate,3azu5v,tonytango,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:52:40 2015 UTC,"If you're a tenant with a lease, it's a minimum 90 day period if the owner was foreclosed on before the notice to quit can require you to leave - you still have time after the notice period is up, during which the eviction process takes place, but I wouldn't recommend having an eviction on your record if you want to rent somewhere else.  If you are not a tenant and simply residing there, you have 3 days from receipt of the notice to quit to vacate, after which eviction proceedings start. In either case the eviction process - depending on whether you show up in court and fight it - usually takes 30-60 days. You may also try to negotiate a cash-for-keys type of deal with the owner- that you will leave the date of his choice for $xxxx. Maybe that $ will give you money to board your animals, or resources to secure a new lease."

He knows his worst case is you trash it on your way out, he loses 30-60 days rent (from future tenants seeing how you're not going to pay him) and $500-1000+ having an attorney file the eviction paperwork and show up in court. There's obviously a limit- if you trash it, he can take you to small claims for the damage. But there's definitely a financial cost.

Ungrounded wiring is normal for a house from the 50s, but is something I would want to upgrade at some point. check with your insurance company to see if it matters to them.  If the wire is too small to the water ehater you should replace it asap.  The wire could be continually overloaded, get hot and the breaker won't trip. danger. fix. sump pumps here do need a dedicated circuit, though I don't know why since they are pretty low amperage. Dump a pail of water in it and see if it works at all.  dry is good!  You'd probabl;y want to ask why it has a pump at all since that was undoubtedly added after construction and there must have been a reason. adding attic ventilation through the roof or gables is usuaally pretty easy and cheap. from a negotiating stance, the furnace works and you knew it was old before the inspection.  who cares about permits of the work was done well?

If I was your agent, I would want to see something in writing from the bank that acknowledges that they approved the suggested scenario above. In all likelihood, they will not because if she's got $20k to give, the bank wants it. In my experience with short sales since 2006, this won't fly.

Numbers from Los Angeles aren't going to tell you what's going on in Chicago. Numbers from Vegas will be completely irrelevant since roughly a third of our sales are cash (last time I looked).  Second, when a property falls out of escrow, no reason is listed in the MLS. So even if you had a research assistant discover that there were 14000 properties under contract and 100 fell out of escrow in some given time period, there is no way to know whether that happened because of financing, condition, short sale issues, title problems, or some other issue.

Whether this is recognized practice or not is not really important, it's your money and your choice by law. Unless the lender has a very good reason, they are out of line, IMO.

To put your mind at ease, property is almost always a good investment. If you look at the crash of 2008 house prices dropped.

I recently bought my first house and it needed to be renovated, which took about 4 months. All the electrical wiring had to be redone as well. Since I've never done this before I just assumed that the contractor has some deal with the power company for electric work and construction power needs. When I was set to move in I called the power company to start service and found out that all the power used during construction was under the previous owner's name.

See if one person has a bunch of signs in a neighborhood you like. Visit an open house or two. Call a big real estate office and ask for the person on ""floor duty."" Interview several agents before picking one to be your agent. That interview is going to be a double interview by the way: you'll ask her questions, she'll ask you questions. Ideally she will begin by asking about your needs and telling you about the current market. A really good agent will have a folder full of stuff like standard disclosures, maybe a market report, and a booklet on the buying process in your state.

RealEstate,3avxnj,ShortWoman,2,Tue Jun 23 23:16:29 2015 UTC,"Great question!  Obviously if you sign a buyer brokerage agreement, you have a legal and ethical commitment. So avoid that.   If an agent shows you property, she is generally considered ""procuring cause"" should you purchase that property. Don't go out to look at property before considering yourself committed to an agent. Do interview several agents before even thinking of seeing houses.   Unfortunately, there are some questions you seem to have that the overwhelming majority of agents won't answer for you. They won't answer questions ""about the area"" beyond the bleeding obvious (""There's a nice grocery store over there!"") because they don't want even the appearance of maybe bending a fair housing law. They shouldn't answer questions about schools beyond pointing you to some resources because everybody has a different idea of what a good school is. Local example: I chose to send my kid to a school with lots of AP classes; Snoop Dogg sent his kid to a school with an amazing football team; which is the ""better"" school? Typical HOA fees are highly variable: I know of a community where the fees are $80 per year, but it's within 5 minutes of a place where the fees are more like $200 a month. Things like gates, pools, clubhouses, and golf courses cost money to maintain.  TLDR: Ask lots of questions, and don't be afraid to do it. Be aware that some questions may not get answered. Don't go looking at houses until you've chosen an agent."
RealEstate,3avxnj,ShortWoman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:21:23 2015 UTC,"I never saw such a thing. The problem is that HOAs can change their fees and many of their restrictions at any given meeting. So even if somebody put together a map or list, that data could be obsolete very quickly.  It is possible to search the MLS to either include or exclude certain HOA restrictions, and it is possible to search for a range of HOA fees, however it boils down to whether the information input by the listing agent is (and remains) accurate. The good news is that you absolutely get the right to look at the HOA package -- including rules, budget, and even minutes of the latest meeting -- after you get an offer accepted.   Wish I had better news, and if you were local I'd point out certain areas of town where HOAs are less common. Good luck."

Particularly if you deal in condos in a particular area of town, you learn about the rules as they were the last time you encountered them (this one is age restricted, that one is pet restricted, this other one is owner occupied only....).

I get business from many agents, but only send business to three, and then based on best fit. (And no, they aren't my top 3 performers.)  They are the three most likely to treat you like gold based on how I've seen them interact with mutual clients, so that I become you and your family's mortgage guy for life. (Yes, that is absolutely a selfish motive.)  Not saying this guy will be the agent you pick or the best agent for you, but it's a two minute conversation worth having with your loan officer if the alternative is calling realtors at random or picking an attractive Zillow ad. :)"
RealEstate,3avxnj,aardy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:11:33 2015 UTC,"I also like talking directly with listing agents. Meeting realtors at open houses is a great, non-committal way to get first impressions. The ones who try to shove an exclusive buyer realtor contract at you the instant you walk in the door are not the ones you want to hire. Good realtors will send you properties, make recommendations, tell you generally about the neighborhoods, and give you time and space before you sign with them.   Even honest realtors won't always work in your best interests if you're a first-time buyer. They'll go through the motions but they won't help you much on price and concessions. The reality is higher price means higher commission, and (particularly if the seller isn't leaving town and in the case of single-broker deals) it's in their interest to keep the sellers happy for potential repeat business. On the other hand, if you make it clear to them that you're in town for the long term, that the existing buyer is leaving, and that you won't do the deal unless it's to your benefit, good realtors will fight for you!"

Credit, income, references etc. I also state ""The unit will be rented to the best qualified applicant, not necessarily the first to apply."" In the event that a less desirable person applies, I continue to advertise and hold out for someone with better objective criteria. Probably there is some reasonable test for the length of time you can wait but in practice (touch wood) I have never had to wait more than a week or two. I am now justified in rejecting the initial applicant on the basis of an objectively ""better"" applicant.   Note - This is legal in my area but in some areas you are required to accept the first qualified applicant. So check local laws.  I would also add that you can encourage or discourage serious qualified applicants by the way you advertise. For example, a bandit sign saying ""Apartment for rent, call Bob 555-123-4567"" will attract shitty applicants. A Craigslist or rent.com ad with detailed information, plenty of quality photos and screening criteria will attract people who are likely to qualify."

We can raise it like 1% a year.  You can ""stack"" the rent raises for like 5 years and then raise it 5% all at once.    You can ask for whatever someone's willing to pay.  I like to price my units $200-$300 a month under market actually, so I can be more picky about my tenants, ESPECIALLY because for the properties in San Francisco county you are stuck with them forever.    I've bought out some rent controlled tenants before for around 70k, but that was years ago before this most recent housing bubble.  I've heard buyouts are in the 200k range now.    We also have Prop 13 here in CA which is basically rent control for owners.  My property taxes don't go up as long as I own the building.

If the person you are rejecting thinks they were discriminated against they can easily find a lawyer to represent them at no cost.  You, however, will have to pay or get your insurance involved to defend you.  At that point you'll need to defend why you rejected them.  Coming in to court and saying ""I lied with what I told them"" will make the rest of your testimony suspect.  No one likes liars.  Now, I wouldn't necessarily tell them the truth either.  I'd find a valid reason to reject them.  Did they have late payments that another applicant didn't have?  Do you have a policy that you take the best applicant according to your written criteria?  Bam, the other applicant is the best one.  There is always a way to find a valid reason to reject someone.  I don't think you'll ever find a perfect tenant with no late payments, perfect credit, perfect references, etc.  Don't over think this.

I'm also not sure who the agent is representing in this scenario - the seller or Peggy (the buyer).  If she isn't representing Peggy then you may be shit out of luck because it's your job to verify everything. Also, if you don't have anything in writing then its your word vs. hers. If the agent does represent Peggy and Peggy decides to move forward then see if you can get the agent to reduce her commission by a couple of grand to cover some taxes or something.   Non-critical observations:   Also, I can't figure out why you keep referring to it as 'earnest' money. Not ""earnest"" money or earnest money. But 'earnest' money.  Why refer to her as Peggy?

If he has not paid the property taxes, there will be a lien for that but as far as paying those and getting the home, it is more difficult than that and a little bit outside the scope of Reddit.  If your neighbor still owns it, try to find a way to get in touch with him. Find the ex wife, or an address, phone number, anything really. Then, you can negotiate with him about buying the property.

RealEstate,3awi4w,biocage,3,Wed Jun 24 01:46:45 2015 UTC,"Land can be one of the most difficult things to appraise. What one acre will sell for is going to be different than what 5 or 10 or 100 acres will sell for (per acre). Same as you can't price a house by the square foot when they are wildly different sizes. It won't work.   An appraisal from 2 years ago is completely irrelevant. Even if your market has been flat (or gone down, then back up since then) that's really irrelevant as well because you can't say that's what vacant land of similar size parcels has done.   Zillow can't even get the price of houses in cookie cutter neighborhoods correct half the time, there's no way they can get land right. LOL.   Before you can value land you have to figure out the highest and best use. Then you have to compare it to other sites with the same HBU of roughly the same size.   I'd charge $1,000 for that appraisal and suspect I'd earn my money and swear off land appraisals for 6 months.   You either need your own current appraisal, or you need a realtor who does a lot of land sales and might have a good idea (if your market is active sometimes a realtor will actually have a better feel for it than an appraiser just looking at numbers).   I will say this though: anything listed for a long time on the market is overpriced. Good luck."
RealEstate,3awi4w,wamazing,2,Wed Jun 24 01:57:16 2015 UTC,"Some realtors tend to specialize. I'd just start calling offices and asking if they have anyone who specializes in land. I'm sure you'll get a lot of yes answers but start asking them questions about how they determine the highest and best use. Ask them how many vacant lots they have sold in the past 2 years, and how many houses. Ask them what they'd do if they have a piece of land and they aren't sure how to price it. Ask as many questions as you can, you might spend a few hours on the phone but you'll get a lead on someone.   And drive around, find the vacant lots, and call the numbers on the signs as well."

There are some McMansions for sale in an nearby upscale neighborhood (with similar lot sizes,) and based on the 20% rule (where the lot value is 20% of the sales price of the property) I come up with their number. It still seems unrealistic to me, but maybe now I know how they got there."

RealEstate,3awi4w,wamazing,2,Wed Jun 24 10:17:07 2015 UTC,FYI in my area the smaller the acreage the higher the price is per acre.  For example a 40 acre wooded lot will go for $80k while 5 wooded acres will go for $25k.

RealEstate,3av1ik,wamazing,5,Tue Jun 23 19:19:12 2015 UTC,"While I don't think the realtors are correct that no one would want this house, I agree that most people who want a house on 6 acres also want the neighbors to be on 6 acres. Country folk and suburbia folk are different demographics. Sure there might be people who are happy with the convenience of the location, but you're correct, comps are going to be tough to impossible.   You've got a classic ""highest and best use"" problem (maybe puzzle is a better word, it's only a problem if you can't figure it out). Is the cost of your property with a house on it, higher than the cost of 24 build-able subdivision lots? I'd bet quite a bit of my own money that subdividing will be more profitable.   You probably aren't in a position to do the subdivision yourself. If I were you, I'd hire an appraiser who is experienced in subdivision analysis. Do an advanced search here http://www.myappraisalinstitute.org/findappraiser/ and under business services choose development valuation and consultation. This won't be cheap but not knowing how much the lots would be worth could cost you tens of thousands of dollars.   Once you have an appraisal, call up the developer and see if they are interested in doing ""phase 2"" there.   I'd also see if I could find the sale of the farmland to the developer, and see what the farmer got per acre. Check out your public records, the recorded docs for your area. Bear in mind that selling 400 or 1,000 acres is not going to give you a dollar per acre that you can apply to your site, because larger tracts often sell for a discount. Good luck."
RealEstate,3av1ik,Ottorange,4,Wed Jun 24 01:39:09 2015 UTC,Sounds like you could make the most money by partnering with a developer to get a subdivision approved and then sell them to a builder. Where are you located?
RealEstate,3av1ik,NumNumLobster,2,Tue Jun 23 21:21:53 2015 UTC,that was my thought too.  I'd at least look at that approach and value the land for that use.  You may want to bounce this off someone more experienced with that type of play than your average realtor.
RealEstate,3av1ik,Archinerd322,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:51:19 2015 UTC,Agreed- hit up a commercial land use agent.
RealEstate,3av1ik,Realestateuniverse,2,Wed Jun 24 01:20:03 2015 UTC,"The only way the property would be viable to a developer is if they knock down the house. We don't want that to happen. Also, the way this neighborhood was structured 15 years ago was that if this plot is developed, the fees for tying in to the water/sewer would all become due retroactive to when the system was installed, so that would be 15 years of fees payable before the first shovel hits the dirt. There isn't enough land to make it economically feasible to any builder. Believe me, we looked into it."
RealEstate,3atzi2,closetklepto,14,Tue Jun 23 14:22:56 2015 UTC,"Short answer - for me it was really a toss up.  Better cash flow with the multi's but tenants tend to stay longer in the singles, which tended to balance things out.  I would go after any deal that makes sense numbers wise and forget any idea like ""Oh I buy tri-plexes only""..  It's simply not practical."
RealEstate,3atzi2,German_Mafia,3,Tue Jun 23 15:03:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. It's not that we only want to buy a certain type, it's more that we're just starting out. Right now we're just keeping an eye out for deals."
RealEstate,3atzi2,GringoGrande,8,Tue Jun 23 15:22:17 2015 UTC,"Having owned a number of each...at least 5 duplexes and 30+ SFH's as well as large multi-unit (100+ unit apartment complexes) about five years ago I divested of any and all multi-unit and no longer have any interest in them...unless I can quickly trade them for an asset I like better.  The two biggest pros, in my opinion, of multi-unit also include one of the biggest cons of multi-unit. First pro is that if you have a quad all of your units are in one spot...they aren't 4 SFH's spread out. However a major con of this is that one bad tenant in a multi-unit can chase the good tenant out. The other main pro I see is if you buy a quad correctly, you can be half empty and still break even. A SFH that is vacant makes nothing.  That being said, the reason I personally only acquire SFH's now is liquidity. When you are selling a multi-unit I'd venture to guess that 99% of potential buyers are investors. With a SFH I can sell both to the retail buyer and to investors...I have a much larger number of potential buyers.  My advice is to try both SFH and multi-unit early on in your career as an investor. I know other investors who absolutely LOVE small multi-unit. My experiences and what I look to accomplish as an investor has made SFH's the best choice for my portfolio."
RealEstate,3atzi2,ajfa,2,Tue Jun 23 23:29:21 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you've been doing this a while. What's your experience with appreciation of multis vs SFR's? What about quality of tenants? What type of SFR property do you tend to rent out (A, B, C, etc.)?"
RealEstate,3atzi2,GringoGrande,3,Wed Jun 24 03:11:04 2015 UTC,"A Fair Amount of Ranting Incoming. Be Warned  I don't buy for appreciation. My opinion of people who buy for ""appreciation"" is fairly low. Cash flow is what matters. This topic has been covered ad nauseam and it may be a good start to research on a forum such as Bigger Pockets.  Real estate is cyclical. It goes up and it goes down. I'm a buy and hold investor. I'm in it for the loooooong term and only sell/trade properties if it is allowing me to acquire a property I like more. As long as the property has a net positive cash flow it becomes irrelevant as to the value of the property. Equity is the icing on the cake at some (distant) point in the future to me.  As long as each house is netting $300-$400 net a month...or more if paid off...and I'm happy with the cash on cash return...let me put it this way.  Have you ever met that person who obsessively looks at their stocks, credit, bank account or property value daily? My experience has been typically those people are scared and not very financially secure or sophisticated.  Here's one that blows the mind of just about every new investor and many experienced investors as well. The ""value"" of a property is completely subjective. It is worth what someone will pay for it.  If you have a 100k house that will rent for $1000 a month I'll give you 200k for it if I can pay you $200 a month until paid in full. I don't care about the price. I care about the terms.   What's your experience with appreciation of multis vs SFR's?   In my area, SFH values increase much more than multi-unit. This may differ in your area. Become an expert in your area.   What about quality of tenants?   Better tenants in SFH in my experience. Then again my idea of a great tenant is someone who stays for a long time, pays their rent every month and I go years without hearing from them. Multi-units seem to have a higher turnover + needier tenants.   What type of SFR property do you tend to rent out (A, B, C, etc.)?   I've owned everything from working class to solid middle class. There is a ton of money that you can make in lower income areas but you tend to have more challenges. When I first got started and had no money I could only find lower income homes. As I mastered my craft I realized I could buy middle class homes they same way as I was buying lower end homes...with seller financing...I only bought C homes in gentrifying neighborhoods or B's...that is what I've done the last 5 years.  I tend to focus on B neighborhoods which mean to me: Middle Class. Good to great schools. 3/1 or 3/2 (preferred) with a value of 100k-200k. Tenants make 50k-70k a year.  Once again, where you live may be a different story. A similar home may cost 500k in many major cities.  I don't consider ""A"" homes worth investing in. There eventually comes a price point where your returns are less and the items in the house are more expensive to fix.  Think about it. All things considered equal, which is likely the better investment: A 200k home that rents for $1400 a month or a 300k home that rents for $1400 a month?  End Rant"
RealEstate,3atzi2,ajfa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 06:53:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that perspective.    I don't buy for appreciation. My opinion of people who buy for ""appreciation"" is fairly low. Cash flow is what matters.    I'm skeptical of appreciation also; but I also know multi-unit owners who didn't take care of their properties and who had to ultimately bulldoze and sell for land value, after years of steadily dwindling cash flow.    Real estate is cyclical. It goes up and it goes down. I'm a buy and hold investor.   Me too; I became an accidental landlord in 2009 (due to a job move) but did not do the dumb thing and sell low. Instead I rented out, and (even when under-rented) the property made roughly 6% ROI a year through the recession. This convinced me real estate is a good long-term investment if you're patient and don't panic.    Equity is the icing on the cake at some (distant) point in the future to me.   In a perfect world, cash would be nicer than equity. But when we're looking at a full percentage point difference between 30-year and 15-year, and the far-earlier payoff schedule, the 30-year is like flushing money down the toilet (particularly if I choose to sell in the next 10 years for any reason).  I just took out two massive 15-year fixed loans at 2.625%, which turned an owned-in-full $300k home into 40% equity in roughly $800k worth of assets. I basically break even in cash flow (principal+interest from rental of the big property covers both mortgages, effectively giving me free rent and full equity in 15 years). I have the cash reserves to weather 6 months of vacancy, or deal with unexpected repairs (e.g. a flood). In the absolute worst case, i.e. job loss + occupancy issues, I would rent out both homes at lower rates and move in with my parents (hopefully even in a recession, it won't come to that -- my wife is a bankruptcy lawyer and recession is boom time for her!)   I don't consider ""A"" homes worth investing in. There eventually comes a price point where your returns are less and the items in the house are more expensive to fix.   You're not alone, and here's where I might be going against the grain... time will tell if this is a bad idea.  My new investment property is a 5800 sq ft ""class A"" house. I got this place for literally under half the price per sq ft of comparable properties in the area, mostly because the seller sold at a bad time (November), did none of the updates ""class A"" buyers demand, and left town as an absentee landlord (i.e. eager to sell, even at a loss). Right now it pulls in $3k/mo and I rent it out unfurnished, but if the current (seemingly stable) tenant leaves I'd rent it out furnished as an option. Typical prospective tenants are temporary corporate relos (particularly in finance), new doctors in residency, new university faculty and administrator hires, and people who are moving to the area with kids who want the best schools in the city, no questions asked.  Back in 2009 I wouldn't have considered this, but a few things have happened:   it's impossible to find good class B-C properties that would cash flow in my market, today. B-C properties in ""hot"" (i.e. hipster) neighborhoods go for almost as much as many class A properties, and they don't rent out for more. to sell a class A property, you need granite countertops and Viking appliances everywhere, i.e. it's costly to flip. But to rent it out, less-than-perfect layout and non-updated bathrooms are acceptable to most tenants, as long as the property is fundamentally nice and not too dated.  anecdotally, I know many friends and coworkers who would rent a property like this when moving to a new city, even if they could afford to buy, just because they don't know if they'll be there for over 3 years. True, in a downturn demand for a class A rental goes down, and vacancy is very expensive. But, on the other hand, the type of clients who would go for this property would likely weather recessions better than much of what's left of the American middle class.   We'll see how well this plan works out..."
RealEstate,3atzi2,GringoGrande,2,Wed Jun 24 13:35:41 2015 UTC,If it makes you feel better I don't disagree with anything that you've said. I do my best when offering opinions to let people know there are ALWAYS different ways to handle a similar situation and what may work in one market may not be as viable in another.  If I could by the McMansion across the street from me for 500k instead of 1.2 million or whatever it is currently listed for I'd be all over that!

But I don't have any of that -- so my best bet was mortgage it, rent it out for a few years, occupy for a few years, then sell (or -- better yet -- do a cash-out refinance and buy another rental property!). It helps that it's in the neighborhood where my kids go to school, and it's a pretty nice place!  I guess the biggest risk is if the rental market tanks and no one wants to rent a $3k/mo property.

RealEstate,3atzi2,RealEmpire,7,Thu Jun 25 02:49:44 2015 UTC,Tenants in SFH typically tend to be more independent. You won't get a call because their front porch light has burned out. Unless there is a major break they will be much more self reliant.   That being said go put your money on the deal with the greatest return.

With duplexes its nice because its one roof to replace, one property tax bill.  Comes with more issues though, like common areas and whatnot.  Its really a toss up on the property.  If you can get a good deal on either, pull the trigger.  My one duplex gives me the highest ROI, but I have a few SFR that have similar amounts.  All depends on the purchase price."

RealEstate,3atzi2,conjunctionjunction1,2,Wed Jun 24 03:08:53 2015 UTC,"I like SFH townhomes. IMHO, multi family homes limit the potential number of buyers if/when you decide to sell, condo tend to drop in value first in a bad economy and rise last in a good ecomony, and basic SFH tend to place too much value in the land that cannot be reflected in the rent. Townhouses tend to be built simply and sturdily and in my area at least, hold their value comparable to standard SFH while getting higher rent to purchase ratio. Also, avoid HOAs and HOA fees whenever possible."
RealEstate,3atzi2,Dr__Dreidel,2,Tue Jun 23 21:06:42 2015 UTC,"Love multis, hate SFHs.  Multis are just better returns, period.  Also I put in a residential manager in anything over 20 units, so my work is minimal other than managing the managers.    I will say the biggest con of multis is noise complaints.  Hate dealing with that crap.  However if you have better built buildings than 1970s California style tinderboxes, you might have less noise issues.  My concrete property in NYC could have jackhammering going on and the tenants couldn't hear each other. But in CA people sneeze and hear it.    Got started in an owner-occupied duplex, then quad, and kept growing from there.  I loved owner occupied to start, but it might not be up your alley."

There are a dozen reasons why the construction company could have done this on purpose (for example, it could have made their build much quicker/easier to tear down all the trees, for what boils down to a $10k fine).  So there is no evidence to suggest they have any interest in ""making it right"".  PS- for $10k you are talking back-filling with 6' tall nursery trees, probably cheaper, shorter-lived species than what previously existed, and probably sourced from the kind of nursery that isn't too deeply invested in the health of their plants.

The building contractor failed to tell the subcontractor he hired to clear the land to leave a section of the lot intact. The entire lot was cleared. Obviously, there's no going back, but the contractor did pay the city fine and also purchased replacement trees. A costly error for the contractor, and a wrong that simply can't be wholly righted. It will take years for those trees to reach maturity.

I don't like 30-year mortgages but even they are a bargain compared to rent.   When in doubt, do the absolute minimum in upgrades, and if something is wrong and it's not structural/dangerous, live with it. In the absolute worst-case scenario, save up $15k in cash and if/when it comes time to sell, you can put that towards improvements that help flip/move the house (or buy your way out of an underwater mortgage).

Tell them that you want them to have them fixed before closing and that you want to inspect the sub floor before the new floor is put down. If you accept any kind of credit in lieu of repairs then you are on the hook for any extra damage that may be found during the replacement.
RealEstate,3atyj0,Pappy091,3,Tue Jun 23 14:22:26 2015 UTC,Thanks.  This makes sense.  The problem with that is we are in a rate lock with our mortgage and rates have gone up a lot since we locked in our rate.  Essentially if I push back closing for more than a week we will have to reset our rate from 3.85 to 4.1 ish) which will costs me a lot of money.     I will have to think about this carefully.......
RealEstate,3atyj0,Pappy091,3,Tue Jun 23 14:24:56 2015 UTC,"Yea, that is definitely something to consider. Then it's probably worth it for you to take the risk and get a credit for repairs. Even if it goes over by a a few grand it will still be cheaper in the long run. It's probably a long shot, but I would also ask to have the floor taken up before closing so that you could see the extent of the damage to the subfloor."

RealEstate,3atyj0,Pappy091,2,Tue Jun 23 16:10:24 2015 UTC,Did you have water sitting in your house for over a day and a half? This is a legitimate concern. The seller's seem to think that this is a cosmetic issue and that couldn't be farther from the truth. They have done nothing to remediate the water issue. Now it is most likely too late to save the floors and mold is a possibility. It's not extortion. It's FAR from it.
RealEstate,3atyj0,TheJessle,2,Tue Jun 23 17:34:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe I should reiterate. It isn't the concern that I'm pointing to as extortion - it's the blatant emotional warfare of using wife and kids being angry/sick/uncooperative. If you have a problem with it, then say so. Make your requests and if they don't understand or respect them then walk away. But throwing in a wife being angry and demanding more money for a repair is crazy!   And just so we are clear: No - I didn't have standing water in my basement. I had a 3'x3' patch of non-toxic mold in my attic that I had remediated by a certified and warrantied contractor but because it wasn't ""their guy"" (totally not specified in the contract to be used by the way) they threw a fit similar to what is being recommended here."

Either way, didn't mean to imply that you shouldn't get what you need from the seller to make the repair and I hope it all works out for you!"
RealEstate,3atyj0,rcrracer,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:23:25 2015 UTC,I agree.  When I am with clients we do our walk-throughs like everyone else.  If there is an issue - we do not close until it is handled.  Rate lock expiring?  Get the seller to pay for it/split it with you and or the lender.  The house is no longer in the condition it was when the offer was originally placed.  THIS is why it needs to be inspected and handled.

RealEstate,3avkyk,lovebes,2,Tue Jun 23 21:16:44 2015 UTC,"Tough to say.  It's obvious there's a bubble in the ""hot"" big-city markets (SFO, LA, Seattle, Boston), especially in B-C properties that make decent rentals and A properties in suitably expensive cities. Part of this is foreign cash, part of it is domestic REITs, some of it is even mom & pop investors, and all of it is due to higher demand than supply.   What if the Chinese stock market tanks? Well, there will be fewer Chinese real estate buyers, but there will still be local domestic buyers. The Chinese who have bought into US real estate are unlikely to all liquidate these assets to move money back home. Also, investors will stay out of China for a while and want someplace to park their money! I can't see this causing US real estate to tank, unless there's a global downturn and the US plunges into recession as a result.  If (when) the US economy tanks and we have another recession, we might see housing hurt a bit but I don't think it would be a complete repeat of 2008. A lot of the buyers now are putting down cash, and the bubble is caused by high demand (not just low interest rates). For homeowners who might lose a job and go underwater, there are more resources than there were in 2008, and lots of people renting instead of buying.   As long as the job market in the US continues strong, people will need places to live and will pay what they need to in rent. If that continues for a few years, we'll see inflation rise and a boom in new housing starts.   I don't have a crystal ball but I'm trying to think of the worst-case scenarios..."

They're buying US property because there's a legal system, a stable currency + economy, and steady growth... That's out of reach of China's government.  They won't be forced to sell (they bought cash), so they can liquidate when they want to.  The only way you'd see some relief in prices is if China blocked capital outflows. But this actually boosts the Chinese currency's competitiveness, so they won't bother. Plus China's government officials are often the ones doing this shit, albeit through their families"

Annual income > 40x rent is a common standard, otherwise you will absolutely need a cosigner/guarantor Fees, fees, fees. You will most likely need to prepare an upfront payment that is at least 3x or 4x the monthly rent, which would cover first (and possibly last) month's rent, security deposit, and broker fee It is NEVER too early to start looking. Streeteasy, craigslist, word of mouth, whatever. Get out there and do some pavement pounding. Start looking at apartments that don't work for you, with the wrong dates, or a crappy layout, or a 6th floor walkup, w/e. But right now, you NEED to get out there and start seeing what's out there, what the market is like. Otherwise, you will have no frame of reference for what is a good/bad place, what landlords are being un/reasonable. Be prepared for an... education. The market for renters is insane and cutthroat like none other. You will probably get screwed somewhere, somehow. Your only hope is to try and not get TOO screwed on anything major.

A legitimate listing will be gone the day it was posted so you need to be ready to go see it the same day.   Other sites: https://livelovely.com, http://www.nakedapartments.com, http://www.rapidnyc.com  Ideally you want to find a ""no-fee"" apartment, meaning you don't have to pay a realtor fee. Realtors charge you 1/2 to 1 full months rent as a fee for finding your apartment. Sometimes the landlord fronts the cost though.   You can expect to pay 1 month's rent as a security deposit (you get this back as long as you don't damage the apt), potential realtor's fee, and the first's month rent before moving in. Make sure you calculate utilities if they aren't included in your budget.  Good luck"

Regarding when you should start looking one month before move in date max, more likely 2 weeks before. When you are looking to move is a very hot time in the market. NYC apartment hunting is something very different from other areas and little time is wasted. Be prepared to see an apartment and fill out an application on the spot if you really want it. Along these lines, land lords don't want their properties empty because it's lost income. This means you look when you're ready to jump. Not having a place set up in advance definitely adds stress- welcome to apartment hunting in NYC! This being said, you may luck out and find a landlord willing to set up your rental in advance, but don't hold your breath. Good luck and congrats!"

RealEstate,3atlbb,Lumod,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:48:29 2015 UTC,"Learn the neighborhood market you're looking at. Have your license, tax info, gaurantor (your parent?) license and w2s for both of you in a zip file in your email ready to forward ASAP and make an offer the second you see a place. They go in hours. On that budget you'll be better off in upper east side, upper west, lower east side, or a really tiny place in murray hill (which are still nice and good location). Sept is awful time to hunt. Most brokers are scum, some are good. Don't ever pay 15% fee, only 1 month max. Utilities vary, probably 100/month each depending on your cable/Internet package. Heat and water is usually paid for."
RealEstate,3atlbb,vsgro,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:47:18 2015 UTC,"A lot of apartments, even if you find them on your own, REQUIRE a broker to get. Some buildings have exclusive broker listings, which means you have to go through them. Some landlords, even if you find the place on your own, have a management company, and you have to pay the management company a brokers fee. Brokers fees are negotiable usually, and can vary from one month to 15% of the annual rent, which is crazy. Most agents are pretty unprofessional, and a lot don't know what they are doing. It is the easiest job in the world, just show people a place and convince them it is great.  Things move fast. You won't be able to see a place multiple times before making an offer. Make up your mind on the spot. Typical documents required for getting the place: bank statement, investment statement, proof of income (usually letter with salary and 2-4 paystubs), last 2 years tax returns, and some other junk.  Check 411 complaints on a building before you rent there. Most landlords suck, but you want to avoid the worst buildings. If there are a lot of open complaints on a property, avoid it like the plague no matter how nice it looks. You could have your apartment flooded multiple times, and then it won't look so nice anymore. Try to see if it is noisy on the street or you have neighbors that play instruments. Don't ignore that stuff because the inside is nice.  Realistically, you won't be able to get that nice of an apartment in the area you are looking. I am guessing you are going to NYU? Good luck."

I have seen a couple of $2500 two beds in Chinatown but its becoming a hot area for good values. Street Easy is a great site to get listings. I would start looking for apartments late July and Early August. All the September listings will come up no later than August 1st. Being a Broker, you don't need a broker to find an apartment but its like any service. Basically we do all the work in terms of finding, booking, informing, and navigating around the city. You basically are along for the ride. People will often prefer no fee apartments but the rent tends to be higher. The broker fees in Manhattan is typically 15% of one year annual rent. You also need to show 40 -45 times the rent or a guarantor that makes 80 times the rent."
RealEstate,3atlbb,JGCASA91,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:11:32 2015 UTC,"Easily the worst part, for me, of living in this city is finding a place to live and moving. First, Sept 1 is just about the worst month to move in. Because school is starting near then, rents are quite a bit higher during those months. Second, $2500 is probably pretty tight for an apartment that would fit two people comfortably. That 40x rent thing is true, and it's 80x for your guarantor if you aren't making 40x. Not that it's impossible, but be prepared.   Third, brokers suck. There are some good ones, but two college students without experience in NYC (maybe unrealistic expectations) are gonna be low on the totem pole. You're probably not getting great service because they know you're going to have to realize that type of apartment you're able to afford is going to be a bit crappier/smaller/older than you think.   No fee apartments seem good, but realize the brokers get better deals sometimes. It's catch 22; pay the broker for more options and lower prices, or go no fee and maybe pay more per month.   Realize it's gonna be one hell of a hassle and probably more frustrating than you're expecting. But, it's worth it to have a little toehold in an amazing place."

If you're as green as you say you are, then trust me you're better off with an agent than yourself. It sounds like your agent is going to reach out to the seller for an extension as they should, but it definitely sounds like they aren't being very vocal about every move. There's not really any advice to be given in this situation except tell you that it happens in this market and they have to let the seller know that there is a delay.  Try talking to them and saying you'd like to be a little more informed about what the processes are and what is going on. Keep in mind your agent can't read your mind and every client is different. I've had clients that are first timers and experts that want completely opposite ends of the hands on/off spectrum. Some want me to send them listings to pick others just want me to weed through them to pick the ones that fit their needs.  To answer your question, you're not asking too much, it just sounds like you're asking too little and expecting too much without communicating expectations.

She was on top of all the details and she communicated with the lender (for example in a situation like the appraisal being late, the lender would have reported it to the realtor, and she would have informed me), but when I asked for any kind of help with decision making she would just say ""It's up to you"" and not offer any pros and cons. She also couldn't really remember what kind of houses I wanted to see and kept sending me inappropriate listings.  I think she was just extremely busy since it was such a hot market.

RealEstate,3autr9,Fuddit,4,Tue Jun 23 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"Don't jump the gun. You don't have a an accepted offer until you've got a signed offer.   Sure you can shop around for a mortgage, or you can just call a mortgage broker. He's got access to multiple lenders, so it's a lot like one-stop comparison shopping. Want a reality check? Talk to your local bank or credit union. Do not call anybody that doesn't have a local person whose office you can visit if there is a problem. Really, you should have had a pre-approval letter in hand before you started writing up purchase offers so a) you'd know what you can afford and b) the seller knows you are serious. Some fees are negotiable. Others are not. Some may say they are waiving certain fees but then you end up paying that money elsewhere. Some states have lawyers do closing documents, some don't. If you're in a lawyer state then you need to get one ASAP. Also, if your contract is NOT a pre-printed document prepared by a bunch of lawyers at your state's association of Realtors with some blanks filled in, you actually needed a lawyer YESTERDAY if not earlier. The most important things you need to work on after getting signatures are: arranging a home inspection; getting your deposit to the designated escrow agent; have someone start working on title search; figuring out what you are going to do about ""my current house right now which is still paying mortgage.""

Take the whole deal into account, not just individual items.  In some states, the actual closing when you sit down and sign documents is done with a lawyer. In other states, it's done with a notary in a title/escrow office. You live there, it's on you to figure out which situation applies to you. I bet if you call a random real estate office, they can tell you (I am assuming from the types of questions you are asking that you don't have an agent of your own who should have already told you).

RealEstate,3avn8r,pseudonym1066,2,Fri Jun 26 00:33:29 2015 UTC,"When you take a mortgage out, the bank makes you sign a contract saying you will pay them money every month for a set period of time , say 25 years. This document, guaranteeing your payment and labor has real financial value.  From this document, the bank creates money. Governments give them the ability to create money, and they then ""loan"" you money which never existed before.  They charge you for the money they are loaning you (that never existed previously), which they call interest. So if interest is 4.5% and the loan is $100,000 you will pay $4,500 in interest in the first year. If your mortgage payments are say $500 a month (which is $6,000 yearly), then in this example only $1,500 goes towards paying off your debt and the rest just goes in the bank's pockets.  So when you ask ""what happens with the mortgage payments you made,"" - most of that money - the mortgage payments - doesn't go towards paying off your debt . It goes towards paying off the interest.  Of course over time you will eventually pay off some of the money off the debt, and over 25 years or so you will pay it all off. The money you pay off (assuming your house stays the same in value) is known as your equity in the house.  When you sell a house you retain your equity (minus any costs like estate agents fees, taxes, legal fees etc which can be of the order of $10 or $20,000) .   Of course, for most people, that equity isn't then kept in a bank account but is used to buy their next property.  As an aside: the whole mortgage process seems like a bit of a scam to me. The etymology of the word is mort (from the french meaning death) and gage (meaning pledge): a ""Death pledge"".  If you can get a well paid tax free job overseas and live frugally for 5 years you can save enough money to buy a small house, and not pay a mortgage on anything. Mortgages have always seemed like a scam to me, and I have never had one, but own a house outright."
RealEstate,3avfhu,fenix8o0,3,Tue Jun 23 20:38:48 2015 UTC,"Anything is negotiable. It just depends on how much you want to risk walking away from the property if they say no. In a buyer's market, you're more likely to get an agreement so the seller doesn't lose the buyer. In a seller's market almost nothing becomes negotiable because the seller can easily find another buyer."

RealEstate,3avfhu,rhino_driver,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:44:01 2015 UTC,"Go ahead and ask for whatever you want. In CA if there are no live termites there is no problem.   Section II in a termite report means there are areas that IN THE FUTURE might lead to infestation.   As for if the banks require termite warranty- that depends.   If you have it in the contract to have termite clearance some banks will require termite clearance, even if you remove it from the contract.   Most however, if the buyer/seller agree to it- will allow you to remove it from the contract (if they don't see the termite report).  If there is termite damage and you turn it into the lender-- well you might be SOL if no one wants to pay to fix it"
RealEstate,3aug6b,AltPerspective,2,Tue Jun 23 16:32:12 2015 UTC,Is your toilet running?
RealEstate,3aug6b,greasyspider,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:17:09 2015 UTC,"Turn everything off (don't forget the ice maker).    Find your meter.  There is a little tiny dial on it that sometimes is a triangle or other shape.  If its spinning something is using water.  Otherwise mark the last digit with a sharpie and let it sit over night.  If it moves you have a leak.    If you have a leak, check all faucets for drips.  Flush the toilets and when it seals put a few dots of food coloring in the bowl.  If it wind up in the bottom you need a new flapper.    Other things to consider:    The water district by me has some weird ass hybrid system of actual usage and estimated usage (for sewer too).  Even if you have not increased usage, if whoever lived in your house last year this month increased usage (say to water plants in the summer?) it could be screwing with their estimates.  You may have a credit coming.    Also have you been watering plants? That would explain it."
RealEstate,3aug6b,NumNumLobster,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, turn off the main at the house. Wait 30 minutes and see if the water meter outside the house has moved.

RealEstate,3aug6b,somethingventured,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:39:57 2015 UTC,"Turn off every faucet and water using appliance.  Make sure the toilets are not refilling.  Now go listen to your water heater.  If no one has showed in the last 30 minutes it should not be running.  You can look at your water meter and see if you are consuming water.  And if everything is turning off and the water heater isn't running,  there's a good chance it's leaking from somewhere."

RealEstate,3at81e,junegloom,6,Tue Jun 23 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"This is not a bubble, or at least it is nothing like the last bubble. This is not caused by venomous loans home owners couldn't afford. This increase is caused by a significant increase in jobs from Facebook, Twitter, yelp, Google, pandora, Cisco, Apple, etc...  Many young and very well paid home buyers are flooding the market. Inventory is low, and prices up as a result. Add in the crazy amount of off shore Chinese investors with unlimited cash and you have yourself a sharp increase in real estate prices. There is no real sign of this collapsing any time soon. Buy what you can, when you can. It doesn't matter, just as long as it's in the Bay Area. Places like fruitvale and Richmond may be the best areas to invest in as they are both projected to be heavily gentrified in the next 5-7 years."
RealEstate,3at81e,eddygoombah,6,Tue Jun 23 09:19:44 2015 UTC,So basically that housing market is supported by Tech companies? That doesn't sound like a strong support to me since it all depends on the Tech companies.
RealEstate,3at81e,TomBradysmom,7,Tue Jun 23 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"This is not caused by venomous loans home owners couldn't afford.   Interesting perspective.  I only consider hat a part of the last bubble.  I think a big problem was the risks people took because of the quick jump in prices.  There were venomous loans, absolutely.  However there were a lot of people who felt pressured to ""get in before it is too late"" and didn't bother to look at what they were actually purchasing.  When the home prices are far outstripping the local economy growth you have a serious issue.    The area is having a great growth currently.  Unemployment is around 5%, growth from the tech industry gave the bay area around a 20% grown last year.  However that rosy picture doesn't change that the median salary in San Francisco is about $80k but the median home price is about $1 million.  Those numbers can't sustain themselves.  Unless the ""average Jane and Joe"" working at a tech company (payroll processors, admin assistants, bookkeepers, etc.) are going to be getting $150k jobs then there will be a correction coming.  Since the median person working the actual technical portion of the job (coders, etc) are making between $150-$200k I doubt you're going to have the average Joe's salary bumped to that level.  Heck, only around 14% of the households in San Francisco can afford the median price of a home.   Add in the crazy amount of off shore Chinese investors with unlimited cash and you have yourself a sharp increase in real estate prices.   That is actually a sign of the bubble at work.  In the last bubble many off-shore or out of state investors were purchasing properties in ""hot"" areas sight unseen and driving up prices.  When the bubble burst thee ghost investors were the first to dump and run leaving the banks holding the bag.   Buy what you can, when you can.   Interesting you say that.  It reminds me of one of the signs of the last bubble I mentioned in my first paragraph.  Get in and buy before it's too late.  Buy what you can when you can."
RealEstate,3at81e,minze,1 point,Tue Jun 23 11:44:36 2015 UTC,I'm trying to time it to sell high. But I don't want to dump it now and then see prices double again!

RealEstate,3at81e,SEMLover,3,Wed Jun 24 04:40:24 2015 UTC,"I just bought in Richmond last year. I have to agree, this is less like a bubble, rents are extremely high and rising which is partly why so many people are buying right now, the thought of paying 3k+ for a 2 bed apartment hurts, so it made sense to buy and least get to live in a real house for less than that, with a bit of a commute added on."
RealEstate,3at81e,ajfa,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:18:39 2015 UTC,"This. In the last bubble, people buying homes with 5% down when they could have rented for less than a 30-year mortgage. Now, rents are sky-high, demand is strong, and supply is low. It's not purely fear-of-missing-out and speculation, it's legitimate market forces at work.  Sure, the economy will eventually tank, and people will be scrambling to move in with their parents or rent a duplex instead of a 4,000 sq ft mansion. But something tells me we're not quite there yet..."
RealEstate,3at81e,OriginalStomper,5,Wed Jun 24 04:43:58 2015 UTC,"If investors (Chinese or otherwise) are significantly contributing to the demand, then it could well be a bubble.

RealEstate,3at81e,eddygoombah,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:40:11 2015 UTC,"This could be said about anything regarding any inflating market. The point is that people are still worried since the last real estate bubble crash. But the circumstances are completely different this time. This price inflation is based on jobs, not bad loans. Any market increase is susceptible to collapse. However this one is much more sustainable than the last."
RealEstate,3at81e,OriginalStomper,5,Tue Jun 23 15:44:43 2015 UTC,"Any market increase is susceptible to collapse.   True, but misses my point.  Real estate markets dominated by owner-occupied properties (commercial and residential) are much less susceptible to crashing than markets with a significant investor-owned component.  Investors can sell, take the loss, and move on much more readily.  The recent bubble was fueled in large part by investors (many of them very unsophisticated) buying real estate they could not afford to keep, in reliance on appreciation.  More sophisticated investors who have the resources to ride out a slump might well choose to do so -- or they might not."
RealEstate,3at81e,jorpjomp,2,Tue Jun 23 15:59:16 2015 UTC,"No, it's not a bubble.  1) great economy  2) very limited supply  3) a LOT of cash buyers = nobody to foreclose  Plenty of other reasons.

RealEstate,3at81e,ajfa,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:07:16 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but from my experience the kinds of people who invest in foreign real estate do so because they want a haven from the insecurity of their home market. For example: when the dot-com bubble burst in the US in 01, did all Americans in NY and SF suddenly sell off their property in Paris en masse? No, they held on to it. With the collapse in oil prices, do you see the Saudis selling off properties in London at fire sale prices? Nope. Similarly if China tanked overnight, you would not see people selling their US homes and taking a loss.   On the other hand, if China stabilizes and the US tanks, or there's massive deflation in the value of the dollar, real estate investors over here will be screwed. Personally, I think the dollar is more at risk for inflation in the next few years than deflation.   I'm much more worried about another US tech bubble collapsing, and foreign investors fleeing the US for Europe and Asia when it recovers."
RealEstate,3at81e,merreborn,2,Wed Jun 24 12:57:30 2015 UTC,It might be partially a bubble.   But it's mostly an issue of supply and demand.

RealEstate,3audml,IncendiaryGames,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:49:10 2015 UTC,"I don't know about any software that tracks expenses that integrate with VRBO/etc. One suggestion is cloud based accounting software like Xero or Quickbooks. You can connect the software to your bank account and do reconciliation. The software will automatically match up income from VRBO/other sites and expenses from your utilities/other commonly used services.   I don't think one program would manage marketing, booking, etc. For the out of state property I'd consider a property manager. Let them handle booking, giving out keys, and assessing units for damage/repairs/cleaning needs after every booking. One idea is you can use VRBO's calendar feature or use a google calendar just for bookings (either way VRBO will need to be up to date to not frustrate travelers.) Use AirBnB to fill small gaps.   If your vacation rental turns out to be popular or if you're in a popular area then for the high season I'd enforce bookings that start/end on a Saturday (or whatever is common for your locale.) That seems to be the standard for most vacation rentals."

Also have thermastats, lights, tvs, security etc all controlled from apps on iphone. So if cleaning company or tenants leave anything on I can turn it off from my iphone anywhere in the world. Saves on utilities. except stove, microwave. Even outlets have app controls, so if they leave a curling iron plugged in I can turn it off from my phone (not that I would know if they we still renting but if seeing an outlet being used while the house is not occuupied I can turn off the outlet).  First question everyone asks what happens if the power goes out or the internet. All important items like locks are on battery backup and I have a 4G celluar wireless hotspot that is on a battery backup. It can run locks and hotspot for 36 hours on battery alone.

Also, who does she expect will do all the English language footwork that will need to be done with these transactions? Sure, she can work with clients who speak the same language. But if she has a buyer, then more than likely the selling agent won't speak that language. Nor will the closing agent/attorney. Nor will the home inspector. Nor will anyone else.   Then when crap goes wrong and good people lose money, their home, or opportunities you are the one whose license is backing all of this. You could lose your license (and she is out of business) or you could be responsible in other ways.  This is a monumentally bad idea, but perhaps you can find other alternatives where she could get in and work for a brokerage that deals with this language clients.

Are you going to sign dozens and dozens of legally binding contracts on her behalf indefinitely? Also, there are plenty of people out there who would like nothing more than to not pay a commission for work done and will find any loophole they can to avoid paying. You know what would work perfectly? Finding out your mom, their agent is unlicensed.   There is so much more to real estate than ""tricks"" and ""codes"". I don't even know where to begin. Does she have someone with a lot of experience to work with when she inevitably encounters a situation she doesn't know how to deal with? Probably not, because nobody would agree to work with someone unlicensed.

So in every single one of these transactions, she is acting as a buyer? The only way I can see this not being a major issue is if she's already a big-time investor.  If she's buying a few homes a year and wants you to be the one to show them to her and collect the commission on them, that's actually not a problem. You need to do the work and you get to keep the money, but she can choose who her agent is, even if you aren't the best at your job.  That said, something doesn't add up. And from the way you phrased your pre-edit post, it would appear that your mother isn't buying these properties for her own use. It would appear that she has some design on selling them to friends and family. If she's ever representing herself as a professional for the purposes of selling homes to acquaintances, you are both up shit creek without a paddle.

RealEstate,3as02q,Faraii,1 point,Tue Jun 23 01:11:41 2015 UTC,"Hi, I have an inground pool that was built in 1987. I have lived here for seven years and dealt with leaks a few times. My advice would be to self insure for the pool. Your highest potential for leaks is in the underground piping, your pool and piping is not that old, you don't start to see problems with pools until about the 25-30 year mark.  I believe you would spend more for insurance than any pool repair you would encounter in the next five years. If you do have a leak in the pool it is a fairly easy fix, if you have a leak underground in piping it is more involved but no more than about $500. Any decent pool company can solve any issues you have.  By self insuring you have that money in your pocket if you don't have any issues which it doesn't sound like you will based on age and what you said about redoing the finish in five years.  My best advice is to start using the troublefreepool.com website. Click on pool school and learn everything you can. I have no affiliation with the site but it has saved me tons of money over the years with small issues that arise. Use liquid chlorine and brush your pool twice a week and you will be good. Don't get sucked into using tabs. This also adds stabilizer and will make it very difficult to achieve proper chlorine levels near the end of the season. Research this on the website I mentioned for more clarification."

RealEstate,3arkh7,DrDifferdange,9,Mon Jun 22 22:57:29 2015 UTC,"The buyer is making a low offer and not giving you much time to consider because they want to get the house for a low price before anyone else has the chance to make an offer.  That being said, I would never not counter an offer.  I have successfully negotiated deals with a very low initial offer to a price that my sellers were comfortable with.  Ex.  Buyer came up from 185k to 230k on a house that was listed at 239,900.  Not saying it happens all the time, but if you just outright reject, you will never know where it could have gone.    In terms of dates, a buyer is always going to put the most favorable dates for them in the offer, it's also negotiable."

There were also a few things that in the final counter, we let the buyer ""win"".  A buyer always wants to feel like they won, so we held some things back until the end (that we were willing to do all along with the right price) to make them feel like they won something on the final counter.

All things being equal if you are renting way below market value that's a much better situation than buying at market value, but your rental situation is very weird and unusual.  It sounds like with a gross income $5,500 supporting three people you'd be right at the edge of affordability on a $200,000ish house after taxes and insurance. You'd have to run the numbers yourself on prospective houses with the relevant figures in hand to decide if it would be a big squeeze or not."

However, with your current income and debt load, I'd only be looking in the $150k to $175k range.   Mind you, I fall on the more conservative end of the spectrum, as I've seen things go south (job loss, car accident, sudden medical condition, etc.).

Some things just need to work, no questions asked, and you don't get extra credit on the appraisal just because you recently repaired them.   part of the agreement with family that gives us this low rent also means that we're responsible for some repairs    This is strange, and you should seek to have this removed from your rental agreement.  Have you signed a document that states this?  It may be against the law.  I mean, there are circumstances where it works - I've seen a 'lodging in lieu of wages' situations, but that shouldn't add repair liability.  The thing about the rental... that's smart money if it's a good deal.  If you're paying a below-market rental rate, you should stay there as long as it makes sense (commuting for work and as long you either don't have kids - or the kids are not school-age yet).  Enjoy the cheap digs and keep saving, you're off to a great start, keep it up!  But being on the hook for major repairs at the rental house is fucked.  That's not how rentals work.  You should approach your family members and tell them to raise your rent to a fair number where major repair liability isn't an issue anymore.  You're essentially giving them a zero-risk investment, and that's not how rentals work.  Ownership = risk.  Also, just being blunt - if you don't have anything signed regarding these repairs... they don't have any real recourse against you.  Even if you HAVE signed something, it may be illegal / unenforceable.  So maybe you just keep the current situation (for as long as it makes sense) with the peace of mind that if something big broke, you can just walk away - it's an illegal / unenforceable contract.  I would still do the small stuff, just in good faith because you're getting below-market rent.  But if something big comes up, that walk-away is in your back pocket.  Just a thought."

And to be honest if that $15,000 repair came up I doubt they'd really ask us to pay it, or at least pay all of it. It's more that they're in kind of a tight space financially at the moment so I'd prefer not to push on the repair stuff. But I think if we can find a house it's better for all of us - my wife and I are spending our money on something we actually own, and they should be able to charge a lot more for rent for the next tenant."
RealEstate,3apo81,meandrunkR2D2,2,Mon Jun 22 17:22:45 2015 UTC,"You can get a conventional loan for as little as 3% down, which would be better than an FHA loan which would keep PMI for the life of the loan.  You can get the PMI removed once you pass the 80% LTV on the mortgage.   Interest rates are still great right now and it's definitely a good time to buy.  My wife and I just closed 2 weeks ago on our new home and put 5% down on a conventional loan with 3.875% interest rate.  I personally prefer owning my own place as I can make it my home, and since you are still on the hook at your rental for repairs, especially potential major issues, I would rather put that kind of money into a place that is mine."
RealEstate,3apo81,whiskey-hotel,2,Tue Jun 23 04:42:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, as a realtor, I am currently recommending to my clients that it is a great time to buy. The US housing market is selling at nearly pre-recession rates and the interest rates are extremely low.   I read study after study that, on average, it is more expensive to rent right now in the US than to purchase. This is exacerbated by the expected interest rate hike later this year by the Fed (due to a healthy, improving economy)  Not sure where you live, but summer months are usually harder on sellers because people don't want to move while its hot, and many people are on vacation. So another good reason to buy.  -source: Arizona Realtor"

If the furnace goes out expect a few thousand dollars to replace, but the roof situation is what would really scare me.  At the very least the insulation needs to be fixed to stop the ice dams, but dams are terrible on shingles so you might be looking at a new roof, as well as replacing sections of the OSB sheeting which could have been damaged by water.  Water leaking inside could mean mold or rot as well.  Can you give a rundown of your take home pay + expenses?  You mention 500/mo for debt service, but what about daycare / groceries / gas / entertainment?"
RealEstate,3apo81,amalagg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"So I did this in detail back in March. Total expenses that month (pretty typical) were $1,850 (that includes the debts but not our rent, since we wouldn't be paying that if we bought a house). Taxes are harder because I don't have withholding, I pay a quarterly estimated tax (1040ES form). This year I'm paying $900 a quarter but depending on what raises I get, etc., I may still end up with a little extra to pay come tax time.  So, as of right now, every month $5,500 comes in and after debts, expenses, etc. we're left with about $3,350. Some months it's a bit more or less obviously but that's roughly where we're at. So I figure based on that we could probably afford to pay up to $1,500 a month on a mortgage, which based on the online calculators I've looked at puts the upper end of our price range at around $250,000...although of course I'd prefer to find somewhere under $200k"
RealEstate,3apo81,MsTerious1,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:20:07 2015 UTC,"The amount of money you will 'lose' as interest rates climb will likely outweigh whatever gains you will get from waiting for your credit score to increase. A lot of mortgages don't require 20% anymore-and while it's always better to have the equity than not- I would say just be cautious, do your homework, shop for a good rate with good terms and jump in. Look at it this way- right now you are paying someone else's mortgage and repair costs and essentially giving them an asset they can later leverage. You could be doing this for yourself instead. :)  regarding PMI- at the time you think you are ready to refinance, consider what that cost looks like compared to PMI and make a decision then. You could always, at that point, 'trade up' and secure a loan at 20% down payment at that time (with savings and equity from the first home) and skip paying PMI altogether while getting into a (bigger, better, nicer, whatever) home and increasing your net worth.  Good luck!  EDIT: Addition  I am not a mortgage professional so please consult one but I was also thinking you may look at homes with income suites if you are up to it. It's my understanding (I am in Commercial not Residential) that you may be able to claim the income from a rental suite on property and therefore have a higher 'income' for purposes of qualifying. Additionally, it will lower how much you are responsible for each month in mortgage payments as it should offset some (or in a hot market, nearly all) of the cost. Be aware though, you should absolutely be able to cover the mortgage on your own anyway- in case you have a dry spell of no renters- and you should prepare an emergency fund for any improvements/fixes. Many times an agent can help you locate one of these income properties with someone already renting a part of it -showing cashflow to your mortgage broker. Okay, I'm done now!"
RealEstate,3apo81,Otter_Actual,3,Mon Jun 22 16:18:17 2015 UTC,That is assuming that prices stay the same on properties. It is also possible that if interest rates climb property values will decrease to adjust for the monthly mortgage payments.
RealEstate,3apo81,JJWoolls,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"Market prices are going up fast now. I believe we are in another bubble that will last 1-2 years and then will have a ""rebound burst"" so to speak.  Interest rates are low still. I wouldn't say there is no ""long term"" benefit of making repairs on the house you're in. Sounds like there's a TON of long term benefits just in terms of the interest you won't be paying because your kind relatives helped you accumulate so much of the principal before you purchased.    I won't try to tell you what you ""should"" do, but I will offer one possible way to keep costs to a minimum if you decide to hold off:   There are two types of insurance policies that are very affordable. A home warranty can cover the furnace issue and possibly a roof leak issue (depends on the policy - I use Home Warranty of America if a buyer needs roof leak coverage.) These policies cost you fifty or a hundred dollars per service call, but then that's your total cost most of the time. Read the fine print in your policy before you order, but I am a HUGE believer in a good policy. The negative is that you have to be careful about the company. (I will never use 2-10 brand again, and if you choose First American you'll have a 30-day wait for major systems to be covered.)  A home warranty doesn't cover sewer lines, but it's about $10/mo for a policy that covers that if you're in an area where it's available. So all in all, $700/year would take care of the main issues you're concerned about on the house."

RealEstate,3asuzt,ProperNomenclature,3,Tue Jun 23 06:07:58 2015 UTC,"You might try a local lender as opposed to one of the big box types. Ultimately you have to conform with whatever rules they have established to manage risk. Borrowers who have smaller down payments are seen as riskier (and there is plenty of history that shows, overall, this is true - no one knows if you will be the exception). If it's your own money, earned and saved up over time, that will make you less risky, but borrowed/gifted money does not. Gifts can also be problematic in that the IRS will consider this ""income"" and one of you will owe taxes on it.   Plenty of people buy properties with LLCs for investment purposes. You probably will pay a higher rate than a typical residential borrower (but not an astronomical rate). An S-corp is (basically) a way to reduce taxes and I don't think is necessarily appropriate for something like this, a partnership or LLC might be better.... but that's a question for an attorney.   You and your parents need to find an experienced real estate attorney (find one who works with investors) and then an experienced tax professional and discuss your options.

RealEstate,3asuzt,frazzledgobemouche,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:05:52 2015 UTC,"We did it this way.  My husband and I wanted to buy a house, but needed an extra $100,000 down payment to make it doable on our salaries.  My father-in-law provided the $100,000.  His name was on the deed and on the mortgage.  At the time, the rule was that each parent could gift each child $10,000 a year.  So with both his parents gifting each of us that amount, we were able to legally account for the $100,000 in 2.5 years ($10,000 from each parent to each of us equals $40,000 per year).  Then we refinanced the mortgage with just us on it and they quit-claimed the deed to us.  We paid all the mortgage payments and upkeep during this time.  It sounds like your parent expects the down payment to be more than a gift since they are calling it an investment.  In this case, you would still put them on the deed and mortgage, but you'd have to outline in a contract what kind of return they expect on their investment."

If this is correct, then the second owner can sell the house for whatever the payoff is as long as the bank is made whole.  It sounds like there is already a foreclosure pending so this is going to include late fees, attorney's fees and any other fees the bank can tack on in a payoff.  That 225k can jump up very quickly when the additional fees are assessed.  You would need to find off what the payoff is, not just the outstanding balance on the mortgage."

Those aren't great numbers in much of the country. There are costs associated with selling but if you don't have other funds for a down payment you may be better off getting rid of it. You could possibly then put 20% down on your new home and find a better investment and have a down payment for that out of the rest of the $130k proceeds.  I guess it depends on whether or not you can easily find a better investment deal where you are. If so, you may lean toward selling.

RealEstate,3apqug,b6passat,6,Mon Jun 22 15:11:11 2015 UTC,"You need your own, full inspection.  Make sure the new inspector is aware that there was some issue that killed a previous deal, and the new person should find the issue.    Go to the inspection, and walk through the house with the inspector.  Insist that your agent accompany you, and ask questions of the inspector.  Take your own notes on issues that you find together, and take your own pictures if you see things you don't like.  When you get the inspection report, review it with your agent and confirm that all the issues on your notes are represented there, and do feel free to call the inspector about any discrepancies.  Inspectors are human, and they miss things/forget things.    The inspection report is a very important part of the process, and it isn't worth whatever small amount of money you'd save by using the same guy."

RealEstate,3apqug,EyeHamKnotYew,3,Mon Jun 22 16:29:47 2015 UTC,"Technically, the advice to get a new inspection is correct. However, there's a common sense aspect, too. If you don't get an inspector yourself, you miss out on someone who has a legal duty to watch out for you. Also, you get the results provided by an inspector who wasn't your choosing. Some inspectors take a brief course and hang out their shingle, while others have engineering backgrounds and years of experience. This is a MAJOR difference in the quality of inspection.   So the inspector says they won't provide it for you, which is good, because if you rely on an inspection he provided when days or weeks have passed, then he could be held liable if you discover a problem that was present by the time you moved in but not when he inspected.  Now the practical side: The odds of that happening are pretty slim. If you'd like to save a few dollars, you could ask the real estate agent to share the results. They might or might not be willing to. It may depend on their relationship with this inspector. You might have to sign a hold harmless agreement stating that you are not relying on the inspection to make your decisions. It might result in you waiving your chance to ask for repairs. However, you have a right to know about any material defects known to the agent and/or seller, and since there's a report they have to inform you of at least that much."
RealEstate,3apqug,MsTerious1,2,Mon Jun 22 16:47:29 2015 UTC,"Get your own inspection done. A few hundred bucks could save you thousands.  Just to add to that, where I am from anyway, when you hire an inspector they are insured and you sign an agreement with them. Now if they miss something you can sue and their insurance will cover it. This insurance only covers the original people who hired him/her to do the inspection. So while he/her could pass along the report if something was missed you have no recourse.   Also things change. A furnace that was working yesterday might not be working today. Same goes for just about anything else in the home. A raccoon might have decided to set up shop in the attic since the last inspection.  This is your home. The place you lay your head. Shell out the couple extra bucks and get a thorough inspection from someone you trust and comes recommended."
RealEstate,3apqug,IHaveNeverMetYou,2,Mon Jun 22 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"I walked away from a home because of the inspection, but the report alone wouldn't have given the next guy a whole lot to go on.

RealEstate,3arc97,caaaaaaaw,2,Mon Jun 22 21:53:03 2015 UTC,So your loan origination fee went down and your interest rate went down?  How much more money are you supposed to bring to closing because of this?  From what you have posted it looks like a good deal on all fronts (lower interest rate and lower origination fee).
RealEstate,3arc97,JonSnowKnowsME,0,Tue Jun 23 15:49:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe it is!  The estimated closing fee also went down, b/c of the origination fee.  The only thing it appears they added to closing fee was a $80.64 fee for the rate change (which is the same as the discount points change, so maybe that explains it) .   I was specifically wondering why the origination fee would go down, and what that huge buy of discount points means?  I'd assumed in posting this that the term ""BORROWER BOUGHT DOWN"" on the rate means I'm buying down the interest rate with discount points -- but honestly I don't understand what that means, it just triggered warning bells and wanted to make sure that I knew what I was buying, and wasn't too good to be true."
RealEstate,3arc97,JonSnowKnowsME,2,Tue Jun 23 15:59:25 2015 UTC,For me my mortgage broker was able to get a bigger credit back from the lender (bank) so that brought down my origination fee.   I would ask him/her to walk you through it line by line and note any fees that increased or decreased.

RealEstate,3aqhvp,chinamanbilly,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:50:04 2015 UTC,"Real estate is nothing more than basic supply and demand. The short answer is, there is more demand in NYC than someplace where values are dropping.   There are also cycles at work in real estate, that replicate virtually everywhere over time. When an area is newly developed, you get 20 years (or so) of growth and increasing values. Then 20 years of stability. Then 20 years of decline. After this cycle (which is not exactly 60 years but will be a combination of all three phases) you have revitalization and gentrification, where a place is considered hot again and the cycle starts all over.   It makes sense from a couple perspectives. Housing 'fashions' for lack of a better word are always changing and evolving. If you grew up with harvest gold formica countertops like I did, when you can afford your own place you want nothing to do with the Brady Bunch style. Another area will probably appeal to you more, and something fresh and new is always appealing.   People who make careers out of developing real estate want to take 'nothing' and turn it into 'something' that people will pay for. So they seek out areas that no one else wants, whether this be vacant land or an area in decline. Supply and demand at work.   If you are familiar with an area, have a good idea what is going on there and think you know what the future will bring, you can time your purchase well and 'buy low' so that someday you can 'sell high.'   Realtors like to say ""They aren't making any more land"" but in Arizona, we kind of do that - we plow a farmfield under, rezone it for residential use, and throw up more cookie cutter houses. So this is one of the most affordable places to live (due to plentiful supply). In NYC, you can't do that, obviously, the supply of land is small compared to the number of people who want it.   It's just basic economics and those principals can be applied to any area, anywhere in the world where a free market exists."

In exchange you avoid foreclosure proceedings. Typically, but not always, the mortgage holder does not go after the mortgagee for the remaining balance on the loan. Make sure to request this if you go that route and get a signed release. Almost any real estate attorney can get you that term. Usually you have to prove hardship to go this route and attempt a short sale first. If no one buys after several month this is usually the way to go.

I'm not sure where you are, but I would high recommend the realtor I used. We didn't try at all to do it on our own and I'm glad we didn't. We sold in 4 days and our realtor sent our offer in between contractions while having a baby (seriously ). If you are interested, PM me and I'll get you her info.   Ps. I'm not making anything with a recommendation. We just had a TERRIBLE realtor buying house 1, and house 2 was the exact opposite."
RealEstate,3aq389,themeatbridge,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"Definitely hire a real estate agent (or lawyer depending on local laws) to help you sell your house. Yes, you will pay a certain percentage to both agents, but it is well worth it. Not having an experienced agent to represent you is like walking into a courtroom without a lawyer. I always recommend to sellers or buyers that dont have representation to find some. You will find yourself outgunned and outmatched and at an unfair advantage if you are dealing with a buyer with professional representation. Many people are taken advantage of this way.  In addition, out of all US annual home sales, only 2% on average are sold without broker representation.  Find a few well known companies in your area. Interview them in person and see what they can offer to help sell your house."
RealEstate,3aq389,Pappy091,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:13:52 2015 UTC,"Just to add to the already good advice here, buyers are going to knock 6% off their first offer on a fsbo. And you may want to consider offering a buyer's agent commission anyway, so you're really only saving about 3%.    Of course, that assumes you would get the same amount selling it yourself as you would with an agent. On average, listings sold by agents go for 12-18% more than for sale by owner closings.   All of this is to say, you're not likely to save any money, and you will do much more work. Add to that the fact that you are an admitted novice. Interview some agents, find out what they can do for you and what it will cost. Most importantly, find out how much they want to list the home for."
RealEstate,3apxyt,ticktockdingdong,8,Mon Jun 22 15:37:44 2015 UTC,"I'd look at buying a duplex or triplex instead of converting a SFR. With converting, you have to get permits, have inspections, and generally deal with a city that may just shut you down for no apparent reason. Duplexes don't need that, they already have the units set up.    That said, your plan is a good one, that many people use. I would recommend reading up on landlording and real estate in general. I personally like Landlording by Leigh Robinson, and Investing in Real Estate by Eldred. Could even hit up your local library for REI books.    Do your research. Look at the market, and make sure you don't overpay. Also, one key thing new investors miss - don't forget maintenance and capital reserves! Rent income - PITI does NOT equal 'profit/income/cash flow'."
RealEstate,3apxyt,Bozhe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:54:00 2015 UTC,ELI5 - PITI does not equal 'profit/income/cash flow'  are you just warning me not to consider potential rent as all profit?
RealEstate,3apxyt,JJWoolls,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:19:56 2015 UTC,"That is exactly what he is saying. A good rough estimate is to take the total monthly rent and divide by 2. That is your profit (after taxes, insurance, maintenance, management). Then take out your finance charges. Anything left is profit."
RealEstate,3apxyt,Bozhe,1 point,Mon Jun 22 21:07:17 2015 UTC,"Yes. Many new investors think 'Hey, I can rent this out for $1000, and my mortgage payment(plus insurance and taxes) is only $800. Sweet, I'll be raking in the dough!' Then they are in trouble when the house needs a new furnace, roof, or even fridge. You need to budget for repairs, maintenance, and capital expenditures. As JJWools said, there is a general guideline that everything except your mortgage payment is going to eat 50% of your rental income. So rent of $1000 means $500 goes towards the things mentioned above, leaving $500 for paying the bank."
RealEstate,3apxyt,friendlyfire,5,Tue Jun 23 01:00:18 2015 UTC,"I convert the home to have three livable units.    I think that's probably where your plan will fall apart.   Assuming the city even allowed it (would have to look up zoning laws), converting a 1 family into a 3 family, with 3 livable units and 3 separate entrances, 3 kitchens, 3 bathrooms, all meeting whatever minimum sq. feet and other laws set in place by the city would be an interesting and expensive challenge."
RealEstate,3apxyt,blipsman,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:52:02 2015 UTC,everyone here has changed my mind - i was thinking it would be cheaper to buy a single family and convert rather than buy a multi. looks like i was dead wrong.
RealEstate,3apxyt,MildlyAgitatedBovine,2,Mon Jun 22 18:23:00 2015 UTC,"There are lots of multi-family homes in the up-and-coming areas of Chicago... agree with others to go that route instead of converting. Dealing with the city on permits to add kitchens and baths, etc? No thank you!  I was interested in buying a 2-flat or 3-flat when my wife and I were looking to buy in Chicago last summer. She didn't want to deal with hassle of being a landlord or living in an older home, so that got nixed... we ended up with a townhouse instead. But I was attracted to the idea of renters paying the mortgage so we could build equity to either move back to the better neighborhoods (moved from Lincoln Park high rise to Logan Square townhouse) or suburbs when we have kids and schools becomes an issue."
RealEstate,3apxyt,noahfencetaken,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:40:25 2015 UTC,but things could go south quickly without a cushion to fall back on   This is also true of your proposed investment.  What kind of money are you starting with?  Have you shopped for properties?  Do you have a realistic estimate of what it costs to convert something into a 3 unit?  Are you willing to have someone living in your building for 30 days on bad terms while you evict them?
RealEstate,3apxyt,solarbuttburn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:53:29 2015 UTC,"Two things come to mind:  Zoning. Legally, you'd need to find a neighborhood that's zoned for multi-family units.  Most single family residential areas are limited to one dwelling unit or as number of units per square feet of lot size.  Illegally, sure you can divide up any house, but the minute your tenants or your neighbors get pissed, zoning enforcement is coming to see you.  Building codes.  Ok, you've found a house that can legally be converted into three units.  Now you're looking at building codes for fire separation, potential new water tap fees for the new units, and then the cost of actual renovation (new walls, separate entrances, sound barrier, fire code egress routes) Not cheap.  I think you're on the right track - keeping tenants close by so you can keep an eye on things, but maybe start with a single family residence that is zoned for an extra accessory unit. These mother-in-law type units can be of decent size (meaning bigger rents).  You can add value by creating the apartment and get your feet wet with a first rental unit.  Claim your rents on Schedule Es and buy your next units. Rinse and repeat.  Good luck."
RealEstate,3apxyt,solarbuttburn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:58:06 2015 UTC,i think everyones response here have convinced me to just buy a multi-unit. i will look in the extra accessory unit option (i assume this is just a smaller home built on the same land)?

RealEstate,3apxyt,nmanjee,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:47:19 2015 UTC,Ok - so converting is a bad idea. Buying a multi-unit home then may be the way to go.  Other than that - where are my flaws.

RealEstate,3apd3a,Smokes35,3,Mon Jun 22 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"What kind of development do you want to do?  And how much money do you have?  A million isn't going to go very far in real estate development.  You don't need a degree, but you do need a plan.  A very good one.  You need to learn the language, you need to get very organized, and you need to spend a long time learning the ins and outs.  There is a tremendous amount of risk involved in some development projects.  You will literally be gambling millions of dollars, and while you can mitigate risk, there are always going to be things out of your control.  Look at this last real estate crash, I knew very smart, very risk averse guys who did all the right things and went from millionaires to bankrupt in weeks.  Do you want to build houses, subdivisions, business parks, industrial buildings, or do you want to own some Taco Bells and collect rent checks every month.  Your risk/return and timeframes are vastly different on all of these.    If you have some cash laying around, you can buy a CVS, never step foot in it, and get a monthly check in the mail for the next 20 years.  You can buy a big piece of land, build roads and sewers, and then build 1000 tract homes."
RealEstate,3apd3a,HarryWaters,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:46:43 2015 UTC,"Since when can you buy a CVS?  They are all owned by a parent corp, like Chipotle.  They aren't franchisable."

RealEstate,3apd3a,WinnieThePig,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:03:02 2015 UTC,"Yup, CVS buys the land, builds their building, then sells the lease.  You buy the LEASED FEE interest.  A new CVS in a good area with 15-20 years left on the lease typically sells for a cap rate of around 6-7%.  A Walgreen's will cost you about 0.25% of that rate, and a Rite Aid will run about 1.5% higher."

You started with no knowledge once, correct?  I absolutely don't know my product, in this sense. That's why I'm trying to learn more about it."
RealEstate,3apd3a,JadedFlowers,6,Mon Jun 22 12:51:12 2015 UTC,"""real estate"" is so vast, and advice for each type varies. Are you buying distressed homes and remodeling, fixing up for profit? Are you buying land and doing new builds? Are you buying cheap and renting out? are you buying multi rental units, and holding? Are you buying commercial? Building commercial? Working with other investors or alone?  IMO, new builds (which is what you seemed to be interested in) will give you the least return on money if you have to contract everything out. Most people I know who do new builds are contractors. New builds you need to do a ton of research. You need to know the area, what else is being built there that will affect your sell price. Not sure where you live, but my city has something like a 3 year wait period on permit for new builds.   Stay away from condos or anything with a HHA fee. The fee can change, and it will always affect your sell price.  I repeat, you need an agent. Build a relationship of trust with this person. They will be your ear to the ground.  Know your niche market."
RealEstate,3apd3a,JadedFlowers,-1,Mon Jun 22 13:00:48 2015 UTC,"First of all, I appreciate your coming around, and apologies for the previous misunderstanding.  You're right - I am interested in new builds, reason being I think it's an absolutely incredible feeling to see something be built from the ground up because of me, be it a company or a building. And thanks for the information.   It seems like new builds does require an enormous amount of research/knowledge. Would you suggest interning at companies that specialize in this right off the bat, or would you suggest starting with real estate development companies that develop smaller, residential houses, and then eventually work my way up?"
RealEstate,3apd3a,Lusitania_420,7,Mon Jun 22 13:19:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's an absolutely incredible feeling to see something be built from the ground up because of me,   So build a snowman. Seriously though, you cannot use emotion when doing investments. It must be purely logical. IMO, that is not a good enough reason to do new builds.   Would you suggest interning   I would never suggest for anyone to work for free anywhere. So, no. Start with a real estate friend. Offer to buy them drinks, take them out and talk real estate. Don't trick them into thinking its social--let them know its business.   You need to be involved in the community you plan to new build. Join the local city/county government. You need to know zones, and what they mean for buyers. You need to know your local schools, and how that affects sales. You need to know the beefs the locals have with their government. (i.e. is trash not being picked up properly, or sewer lines need redone--which might cause a huge tax increase in 3 years--just in time for you to sell, which affects your bottom line)  I would suggest taking real estate courses, and being apart time agent for a  while."
RealEstate,3apd3a,TElrodT,2,Mon Jun 22 13:38:37 2015 UTC,Got it. Looks like getting into new builds will take a lot more time then I expected. It'll be a fun path to go down :) Thanks a lot for the advice so far.

On the other hand, maybe their score just improved and you see a string of spending - new car loan, 3 new credit cards maxed out- that's a bad sign.

Cool feature is you can have a link generated for you that you could add on your listings so that way serious people would just fill the forms out and it would be sent to you.  EDIT: With regards to your last question, I would say the credit history is a little more important than the score. I had people apply with upper 500's/lower 600's who had made some bad financial decisions years ago and it still hasn't dropped off their reports.

So if you have $500/month in debt (car, credit card) + housing payment $xxxx / $10,000 combine income = 45%, you can qualify for $4000/mo (500 + 4000 / 10000).

Anywho,  The exact number depends on exactly what interest rate we're talking about.   But here's a rough number: HOA dues of $100/month is about the same as financing another $20k. At 20% down, that's about $25k in additional purchasing power per $100/month HOA bill.  So for your $350/month scenario, we just do 3.5 * $25,000 = $87,500.  However it is very likely that your homeowner's insurance will also be cheaper if it's a condo. I am not in the insurance business, and homeowner's insurance costs will ALWAYS be very property specific. But let us hypothetically suppose that because it's a condo and you only need 'walls in' insurance, insurance is $75/month cheaper (this is very rough ballpark consistent with what I see here in California, and I will emphasize again that this is prop specific).  OK, so we subtract $75 from that $350 and do that math.  2.75 * $25,000 = $68,750.  Big picture zoomed out to the 5 to 20-year time-frame, it is worth keeping in mind that you can pay down your mortgage and/or refinance to make it go away or lower the monthly payment. But HOA dues only change one way... up."

Then send a strongly worded letter to the landlord or the management company demanding return of your deposit via certified mail with a clear timeline and an active threat to take the issue to small claims court if you do not receive a response. Keep a copy for yourself and be prepared to follow through in small claims if they do not cough up your deposit promptly.  Carpet replacement is generally highly suspect since it just plain wears out after a few years, and in general there is a high burden of proof and procedure for landlords to keep your deposit rather than a high burden for tenants to prove they didn't fuck stuff up with move in photos etc. If they do not have photo evidence and receipts for expenses incurred (for instance charging you $10 to dust a lampshade) small claims magistrates will most often look upon that very poorly. The story about the fridge also plays into your favor since it makes the landlord look like a cheap slumlord, exactly the kind of jerk that WOULD try to steal your deposit."

With that said, you're going to want to agree on a price between all the parties.   Perhaps you should hire 1-2 appraisers and 1-2 inspectors. Between those people you should be able to figure out a fair price and the issues involved with the house.  As for the divorce, will her parent's agree to a price?  You will need both of them to consent to the sale (like any other transaction). Possibly incorporate the price into the settlement agreement. The title company, should you use one, will want to know if any of the parties are a party to a matrimonial action (i.e. divorce) and you may need some additional documents to be executed before the transfer.  I know that you're all related parties but I would advise you to get your own attorney. The parents will likely retain their own attorney for the divorce already.

RealEstate,3alt9c,TheDumbEnd,22,Sun Jun 21 14:04:25 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you are trying to use a metric you don't understand, to be frank.  A cap rate is a function of income.  If a property produces $1,000,000 of NOI annually, and you buy it at a 5% cap rate, you are paying $20,000,000 for it. (1,000,000/0.05).  As an investor, you would prefer to buy it at an 8% cap, because it would only cost you $12,500,000 to get the same income stream. (1,000,000/0.08). Hence, buying at a higher cap rate is preferable as is selling at a lower cap rate.  You shouldn't be using a cap rate on a single family house anyway, though.  Use a gross rent multiplier."

RealEstate,3alt9c,umm123umm,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:48:16 2015 UTC,"The lower the better.  There is no ""ideal"" value.    GRM is sale price divided by gross annual rent.  It tells you how many years of gross rents it will take to recoup your initial investment.  Example: $1,000,000 (purchase)/$100,000 (gross rent) = 10.  10 is your GRM."
RealEstate,3alt9c,notjokingbro,3,Tue Jun 30 21:31:05 2015 UTC,"you are saying the same thing two different ways.  A lower cap rate indicates a higher value (and a lower return), a higher cap rate indicates (a lower value) and a higher return.    If you are buying you want cap to be high, if you are selling you want it to be low.  It is just the ratio of return to price.  Also don't use cap on SFH, its a poor metric for a lot of reasons.  Most commonly poor historical costs, difficult projects, and very small area specific markets.  GRM is a better weed out metric there.  Cash on cash is what most people go to after that I believe.  IRR would be a good one after that too.  Even in Com cap is more a comparison metric  --edit-- when I say value in this I mean the price it is worth, not whether it is a good deal or not btw.  Reading /u/Radico87 's resposne I wanted to clarify that.  If you are looking at two properties, one with a 5 cap and one with a 6 cap, the 6 cap is not necessarily a better deal if it is more risky.  They could could be equally attractive or less."
RealEstate,3alt9c,NumNumLobster,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:34:42 2015 UTC,"You're correct, I have always used cap solely as a marker of risk, not proxy for value. I didn't go into which party wants which cap since that wasn't really part of OP's question, though.   Irr is only good to look within a project, it's important to remember that you cannot use irr as a basis for comparing mutually exclusive projects as it has no risk variable in the equation, NPV from dcf or direct cap does. It was a bit of a pet oeeve when folks I worked with used irr to triage projects - the math doesn't work that way."

Agreed on the IRR thing, its still good quick metric to stop/go a project or find the ""this is the most we'd pay for this"" point.  I'd say with all this stuff, no harm in looking at it all, just its important to understand what each thing is telling you and the limitations around them."

RealEstate,3alt9c,Radico87,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:48:35 2015 UTC,"Don't think of Cap rate as an indicator of better value. It is an indicator of investment risk. You'd need higher caps to make a risky investment worthwhile. Residential tends to be less risky than other commercial classes because it applies to apt buildings not individual houses, so when your entire income is based off one unit in one house, that sounds pretty risky to me."
RealEstate,3alt9c,cosgus,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:33:44 2015 UTC,The whole idea of CAP rate as a measure of risk used to confuse me.  It makes sense and is technically correct in an efficient market but in practice it's not always true. I've seen rehabbed section 8 duplexes with good long term tenants sell at 20% CAP rates. Ive also seen neighborhoods display bubble behavior because of rumors of zoning changes that will allow for redevelopment. Investors start overpaying and next thing you know properties are selling at 2-4% CAP rates on a risky speculative play.
RealEstate,3alt9c,Radico87,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're right about that one. Section8 are always going to be section8, so you require a higher cap to go forward with it.  I've also encountered that bs speculation, even heard of collusion to spread rumors just to get rid of underperforming assets. But that was in a small niche market, not a major metropolitan one."
RealEstate,3alt9c,GringoGrande,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:11:58 2015 UTC,I guess that is what confused me is that I know that a cap rate is a measure of risk so why would I want to buy a riskier property(I am pretty risk averse and would prefer a lower more reliable return). Other than to negotiate a lower purchase price
RealEstate,3alt9c,JJWoolls,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:40:45 2015 UTC,To jump in with /u/numnumlobster I strongly suggest NOT using cap rates on SFH's. In my opinion cash on cash is a superior metric for SFH investing. There are numerous articles on this if you are interested enough to research.  A big difference...cap rates do not take into account the mortgage payment...cash on cash does.

The problem I have with these online lenders is that they get appraisers that are not savvy in my market . They end up under appraising properties. So now the buyer either has to come up with additional money to cover the difference or try to re-negotiate the price.   As a listing agent, I always advise my clients to pick an offer that comes from a local lender so you don't have to deal with these problems. They are also much more reliable."

RealEstate,3am7ly,fairly_quiet,3,Sun Jun 21 17:44:13 2015 UTC,"Lenders can use any appraiser they want (who is qualified and licensed).   The problem isn't with the location of the lender, exactly. It's that some lenders use a nationwide appraisal management company to pick appraisers from. Some local lenders use these companies too, but for an online lender it's more common. Much cheaper to outsource finding an appraiser to an AMC who claims to cover the entire country. Sometimes they have someone right there, sometimes they have to send someone from another county over.   But the bigger problem with AMCs is that they keep half the fee the homeowner pays (or more) for themselves. Lots of good appraisers won't work for AMCs because they can find more profitable work by directly engaging with local banks. So the AMCs are stuck using noobs who are desperate for a little cash but have no idea what they are doing. Another common thing seen at some of these AMCs is that a longtime appraiser who is near retirement and no longer gives a crap takes the job for $200 and sends out an unlicensed ""trainee"" or runner to do the job, pays them $75, pockets $125 for doing nothing. THAT'S going to be a good report, I'm sure.   While I understand someone wanting the cheapest rate possible, there is a point where a business (the lender) has to cut quality in order to compete. In many things in life you get what you pay for. Best of luck to the OP, maybe you'll get lucky."

This is still not the end of the deal,  but those ""issues"" can trigger the requirement of a second appraisal to verify accuracy which can slow down the closing process.

RealEstate,3anu1x,DarkRider23,2,Mon Jun 22 01:48:56 2015 UTC,"Keep renting. Houses typically break even at the 5  year mark, so unless you're going to be around for 5 years, it will be a losing venture.  Renting a home for the mortgage amount is going to become a loss over time. What happens when something needs to be repaired? You're now negative for the month. Big ticket items like a heater or new roof will kill whatever you're making back in equity."

RealEstate,3anu1x,wamazing,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well first off, if you rent for the price of your mortgage you are going to be losing money. Houses cost more than the price of the mortgage, taxes, and insurance. Here is a worksheet lenders use to get an idea of future expenses. You should really be putting aside 10-20% of the monthly rent.  See p 2 in particular. http://www.freddiemac.com/singlefamily/forms/sell/pdf/998.pdf  The other problem with renting long distance is that you are at a major disadvantage if something breaks or needs repairs. Hard to tell what's going on or if what someone is charging you is reasonable etc.   Renting to relatives or friends is also dicey; if you do that make sure you get EVERYTHING in writing starting with a good lease. What will you do if they get behind? Do you have what it takes to evict them? Do you have a cash reserve so you can make the payment if they don't pay you for whatever reason? Search for tenant issues here for a small slice of what you may be dealing with.   I think this sounds like a bad idea. Renting is sometimes smarter, financially, than buying. I would just wait if I were you."
RealEstate,3ajtgs,approx-,21,Sat Jun 20 22:09:10 2015 UTC,"There are several ways to handle it, and it entirely depends on your situation. You can indeed sell, move into a rental, and start looking. You can also put your property on the market and make offers contingent on sale of your current home. Often this plan will involve 2 closings in one day, or a very short hotel stay with your stuff in storage (I've done this multiple times on cross-country moves, so all our stuff was in a moving truck someplace). A third plan involves a bridge loan: you borrow the downpayment and pay it back after the sale of your old home is done. Or, you can save up a relatively modest downpayment, get an FHA loan on your new place, rent out and/or sell the old place, and eventually refinance your new place to get out of PMI. There are probably other options as well.  How creative are you, how solid are your finances, and how much risk can you handle? Ask yourself these questions.   Good luck!"
RealEstate,3ajtgs,ShortWoman,8,Sat Jun 20 22:25:40 2015 UTC,"One answer I don't see here.

RealEstate,3ajtgs,907Pilot,2,Sun Jun 21 08:12:35 2015 UTC,The problem with that is that most lenders will count your mortgage payment as debt and they won't consider your rental income as real income until you can 2 years of tax returns proving that you are renting it out at that price.

Most people in that situation that can't qualify for or carry two mortgages put their house on the market and get it under contract, and then go find another one quickly, and co-ordinate the closings so that you are going from one straight to the next.  If they don't find something quickly, then the rental is really the only option other than staying with family until they find the home they want to buy, which would likely be cheaper but still involve moving twice.  A double move can be less painful with a POD for storage of the items that are not necessary for day to day life, those items can be packed up and stored, then delivered to the new house when you find it, then those items only need to effectively be moved once."

RealEstate,3ajtgs,f04ee231826c6c0,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:45:27 2015 UTC,"It is all about your debt to assets ratio. Most lenders will not lend to someone who has more than 30-45% of their income going towards debt repayments. So the easiest way to factor whether or not you can get a second home is to calculate up all of your debt and generate a percentage based on your income. After you get that ratio, then you need to figure out how much you could max out your mortgage amount until you hit the 45-50% debt wall with creditors. The easy way to do all of this is to just get a mortgage lender that specializes in business investment mortgages to do a pre-qualification letter. You need to already have saved up at least 20 to 25% down in cash for whatever dollar amount of a home you want to buy (ie: 20k for a 100k house). I was able to do this to do 2 investment mortgages with a 50k salary a year. Note that I could only qualify for the bare minimum of 64k house, 12k down which put me at exactly 50k left in a mortgage. Most lenders will not lend any amount smaller than 50k after the down payment."
RealEstate,3ajtgs,technical_guy,1 point,Sun Jun 21 14:02:34 2015 UTC,"You'll need to sell your existing house. First you'll need to list it. Realtor will cost 6% commission, and miscellaneous fees usually eat up another 1%. Then you'll pay off the existing mortgage. Depending on what type of mortgage (15 vs 30 year) you'll have already paid off more or less principal, so the amount you owe is not the same as the amount you took out the loan for. If you're unlucky with the market, you'll basically break even (or lose your downpayment to commission and fees).   Sometimes (in a down market) you can start making offers on homes that are contingent on your existing house selling. But many (most) people opt to sell first, rent for a year, and then buy a new place.  In some cases sellers are lucky, for example:   you've been building equity steadily through mortgage payments over the years, and owe a lot less than you think you do (this can happen with a 15-year fixed if you've been in the place for over 5 years).   the value of the property has risen, it's a sellers market, and everyone is buying. Then you'll likely make (quite a bit of) money on the sale of the home. In this case, you might not even want to sell your existing home at all: do a cash-out refinance on it and liquidate some of that new equity, and use that for a down-payment on the new place. Rent out your existing home and use that rental to subsidize both mortgages.    Good luck!"
RealEstate,3ajtgs,mrsentinel,0,Sun Jun 21 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"I feel it is dumb to sell a house period. Try to refinance it as cheaply as possible (even an interest only loan if you can qualify), then rent it out for 3 years. It will appreciate in value and the renters will be effectively paying for your mortgage. After 3 years you can sell it for the tax advantage of the 2 out of 5 year rule, or just keep renting it for perpetuity.   After you refinance your place, go look for another house to buy preferably getting pre-approved for an 80-15-5 loan (where you only put down 5%) to buy it. This avoids the PMI requirement and keeps as much of your cash as possible in your own hands though may be a little higher interest rate.  Just approach your banks or local credit unions seeing how much you can get pre-approved for.    This is not for everyone but my personal opinion is you should never sell a house you purchased unless a) there is a big tax advantage (such as the 2 out of 5 year rule on a rental) or b) you are ready to retire. I believe house prices always increase over a 10 year period. My neighbors bought their house for $29,000 about 35 years ago and now it is worth $700,000 plus."

You say it is dumb to sell a house period, but you mentioned someone who had a house increase from 29k to 700k. It makes a lot more sense to sell that house and then reinvest that money into multiple properties to spread out the risk. If that one house crashed you would be screwed. If you had 7 houses at 100k each crash then you can still come out ahead by renting them until the market comes back."

I agree with you about spreading the risk if you can but also would stress the one example was just to show if you purchased a house for $50k and kept it financed at 90% of the purchase price with an  interest only loan for 10 years it most likely will be worth a lot more.  there are exceptions but I believe historically over a 10 year spread residential housing has always increased in value.  Sometimes by a lot (1995 - 2005), sometimes by a little (2005 - 2015) but historically this seems to be true at least in developed nations and excluding blighted cities (where some regionalized calamity hit them)."

Vinyl is also not impact resistant at all, and, well, hail. I would actually, personally, go as far as to say that Vinyl is inappropriate for installation in the south.   My experience with brick veneer is that it's also not all that great. The main problem is that we've got a lot of bugs in Texas that like eating moist wood, and moist wood is something that happens behind a brick veneer. It's not easy to get behind the brick veneer to repair any damage that's done. Most realtors don't seem to care much about that, but as a homeowner, I sure do. She's right though about brick siding being more energy efficient because it create a thermal barrier between the framing of the house and the surface the sun hits.   Now, what you can do to get the benefits of the brick is to put the Hardi up in a way that simulates the air gap between brick and framing. this is often called a ""rain screen"" installation."

RealEstate,3aijuv,rougehuron,2,Sat Jun 20 15:04:01 2015 UTC,"I have done rental to condo conversion.  The process is very, very dependant on your city zoning and planning, and may not be allowed at all.   All of those things like sharing of infrastructure, bylaws, fees, etc must be legally defined. This requires surveyors, planners, engineers and specialized development/real estate lawyers.  It may also require significant upgrades to the building since the legal change in status often triggers a requirement to bring things up to current codes.  It does vary a lot by location, but count on it being expensive, confusing and time-consuming.    In my city, it tends to be fairly difficult, and so it took us 4 years and tens of thousands of dollars in fees, lawyers, planners, consultants, etc.  I have also assisted with this in a nearby city where it is easier, but the cost was not much less (and the time was perhaps 2-3 years instead.) It may be even easier elsewhere, but as I said, it really depends on where you live.  In short, find someone local who has done it and find out if it's even possible. But, it's a significant amount of hassle."

In NY, to subdivide a building (different tax lots etc.), would require it to go condo or coop (does Michigan have these?). It may not be worth it to the owner as it can be very tedious/expensive and time consuming.

RealEstate,3aijuv,TOMtheCONSIGLIERE,0,Sun Jun 21 16:08:41 2015 UTC,Agree with /u/sonalogy that it's a complex process.   An easier approach to a (possibly) similar end result might be for you to master-lease a floor from the landlord and then sub-lease it to multiple tenants. That way the landlord gets a steady stream of income and you can gain the entrepreneurial benefits of running the place well.

Or you can buy out the monthly mortgage insurance by paying what works out to be 2-4 (depends on FICO, etc) years worth of mortgage insurance all at once at closing. Going from 10% down to 5% w/ the difference buying out the mortgage insurance is done from time to time.  Or you can have lender pay the MI and bump the interest rate accordingly.  Or you can suck up the PMI until you have 20% equity through some combination of savings and appreciation, and refinance at that point.  But, ya, lots of options. If your current loan officer isn't willing to go through all this with you, tell your realtor and she will either kick her/him in the butt or refer you to someone better."

RealEstate,3agoag,canoxen,2,Sat Jun 20 07:00:54 2015 UTC,Depends on how long you're going to be there. And it depends on what your second mortgage options are or aren't.
RealEstate,3agoag,aardy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 08:22:51 2015 UTC,"Calculate the up-front cost, divide by the monthly savings this will get you. The number you are looking at is months to break even.

RealEstate,3agoag,aardy,18,Wed Jun 24 21:32:48 2015 UTC,"FYI-If you have an FHA loan, the PMI is now for the life of the loan and you will have to refinance to be able to remove PMI, and have 20% equity at the time of the refinance.  Otherwise the suggestions I see so far are solid."

The only downside to portfolio lenders is that they seem to be a little stricter on credit criteria and appraisal value because they don't intend to sell your mortgage off."
RealEstate,3agoag,lazyjeenius,2,Sat Jun 20 03:48:10 2015 UTC,Once you get up to 20% in equity of the mortgage you can cancel it.  If you aren't going to take a 2nd mortgage out the fastest way is to pay down the principal of the mortgage.  A few hundred dollars a month and you're on your way.
RealEstate,3agoag,kekehippo,2,Sat Jun 20 13:17:16 2015 UTC,"Depending on your lender and creditworthiness, you may be able to essentially ""pre-pay"" a certain amount of PMI without having to reach the 20% threshold.    My lender gave me two quotes when I told him the house value we were looking at and the amount of down payment we would have (~10%).  One quote had a monthly PMI that would last until the 80% and one was a fixed amount that was the equivalent of 3.5 years of PMI payments.  So as long as we live there longer than that, we would come out ahead."
RealEstate,3agoag,justathoughtfromme,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:39:02 2015 UTC,"There are MANY ways to get around paying PMI, but not all of them are great. If you have not yet purchased, and you do not want to pay PMI, avoid FHA or plan on refinancing as soon as you have paid it down. The catch to this plan is that a lender may have a policy to only do refi loans for 75% of the value. If the market values go up, you're in good shape. But if they go down or stay flat, you'll be stuck for a while.   If you can find a second mortgage, that may be a good option."

I don't believe that the other bidder didn't know it was a final offer - if you had gazumped and taken his offer you would have always wondered if he was going to try to screw you later in the process.   Some commentary for US readers: In the UK, offers are verbal until very close to closing when the solicitors (attorneys) write the contract. All due diligence is done based on non-binding verbal assurances. In addition, it's common to have long chains of buyers and sellers trying to buy new properties and sell old ones at the same time.  As a result, in a hot market unscrupulous sellers sometimes jack up the price at the last second, forcing the buyer to pay more or lose the house and make the chain fall through. This is called ""gazumping"". In a weak market the buyer can do the same to the buyer, which is called ""gazundering""."

RealEstate,3ah3zz,The137,10,Sat Jun 20 03:11:24 2015 UTC,"Are you trying to do this without a realtor? Why not engage a realtor?   Land is one of the most difficult things to appraise, especially in the range of size you are looking for (anything that gets beyond one house site basically). You are really at risk of being ripped off, to put it bluntly. You need someone who does a lot of vacant land sales in that area.   Drive out there, call the realtors whose names are on the signs (even if they are just on houses for sale). Ask them how many pieces of vacant land they've sold in the last 10 years there. If they haven't done any ask if they know anyone who specializes in land. Call the local real estate brokerages and ask for their best land agent. That may not be the only criteria for picking an agent but you don't want someone inexperienced in this.   People think they will save money not using an agent, but I truly, honestly, never saw, NOT ONCE a ""low"" sale in 10+ years of appraising that when I call to ask why it was low, they said, ""the buyer didn't have an agent."" More often the reverse happened, there was a high sale and a dual agency.   A few times there were low sales and it was because an agent bought the place themselves, so they took a discount in lieu of a fee (which is questionable, tax-wise, but not really my problem as long as I could explain it in the report). But never saw that discount passed onto a buyer.   Once you find an agent they can set you up a search that meets your criteria and you'll get alerts when new stuff gets listed. Good luck."

RealEstate,3ai35a,wouldntnickel,5,Sat Jun 20 11:34:32 2015 UTC,Often to get the advertised interest rate banks want 25% down. 20% down will get you a blended rate of close to the advertised interest rate if everything else checks out. (Currently going thru a similar situation)  A person can give 14000 a year without tax consequences. My understanding is that the letter can be a simple to whom it may concern. X is gifting y and z $ for the purpose of a down payment towards a home purchase and is expecting nothing in exchange. You may need to provide 2 or 3 months of bank statements from whatever account that $ came from to prove it's been there (my bank told me this checks against laundering).   Good luck!
RealEstate,3ai35a,veganbiker,3,Sat Jun 20 12:18:42 2015 UTC,"My parents and grandmother helped us with our down payment.    Our lender told us we needed to have 5% of the down payment ourselves. Don't know if this is a rule but it's what she told us. We didn't mention anything about the gift when looking for preapproval, the lender only cared about salary and if we had 20% when we were getting preapproval. The gift didn't come up until we started applying for the mortgage after we found the house. My parents had to sign a form saying this was a gift and we are not expected to repay them. Then they had to prove prior to giving us the money they had the amount in their account for at least 60 days. So they could either get their bank to write a letter saying they had the amount in their account for 60 days or they could provide the statements. You can probably start once it's deposited.   I don't know how long it will take you to find a house but if the gift amount has been sitting in your account for a least 2 statement cycles the lender consider the money yours and you won't need a gift letter."
RealEstate,3ai35a,Tigerzombie,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:07:28 2015 UTC,"As long as the gift doesn't show as a deposit on one of those statements, then it opens up a can of worms as to verifying where the deposit came from.  It has to be in there and deposited prior to the two bank statements."

RealEstate,3ai35a,Tigerzombie,3,Sat Jun 20 15:29:21 2015 UTC,"The guy to ask about what is required and what must be on the gift letter is your local mortgage professional. He's the same guy that can tell you about interest rates. Remember that part of the pre-approval process involves handing over 2 months of bank/brokerage statements. You will have to explain any non-paycheck deposits made on those 2 statements.   Now, you do have one question I'd like to address:    She has flagged a couple of bank owned houses. What is a realistic percentage under asking to offer on these? I know every bank, house, and situation is different, just curious on your thoughts.   What you can offer ""under asking"" and still get an accepted offer on these or any property depends primarily on your local market conditions. If you were my client, one of the things I would do is tell you what's going on locally so that you have realistic expectations. It is not realistic to assume you can offer under asking just because it's a bank owned property. In some markets, offers effectively bid up from list price! Base your offer on your market and the recently sold comparables, not some formula of ""minus 5% because a bank owns it."" TLDR: interview a few buyers agents and pick one who can help you make sensible offers and guide you through the buying process."

A good agent should be able to give you a sense of which. She can also pick up the phone and say ""Hi, I'm calling about your listing on 33rd street. Is there anything I should know before going out there with my buyers? Do you have any offers currently?""  Second, and this is the important thought: Do not fall in love with this or any property you do not own. Too much can go wrong between ""I love it"" and ""it's mine.""

Fannie Mae no longer requires a minimum contribution from you if you're buying a 1 unit principal residence. It can all come from a gift. Freddie Mac on the other hand still does.

See this post from another poster for why, as well as the other posts in this thread:   Then they had to prove prior to giving us the money they had the amount in their account for at least 60 days. So they could either get their bank to write a letter saying they had the amount in their account for 60 days or they could provide the statements.

Your lender might ask to see a bank statement from him showing that the funds are real and a quick 5 second phone call to him confirming that he's able/willing to gift it to you to purchase a home, but (unless your loan officer's institution has overlays) it will not need to go to underwriting for scrutiny.  Unless the funds touch your account, in which case read the other posts here for scrutiny and harassing your donor for a bunch of BS paperwork above and beyond a simple 1 page gift letter down the road.   I'm not sure where escrow account comes in during the application/buying process.   Once you are 'in contract,' someone will 'open escrow.' When you hear people talk about being 'in escrow,' they essentially mean 'in contract to purchase/sell a home.' An escrow account is a neutral 3rd party account that holds funds for disbursement in accordance with the contract, managed by an escrow officer. Basically it keeps everyone honest."

RealEstate,3ai35a,chiquitatarita,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:49:00 2015 UTC,1) Not really sure what you are asking here but if you are asking will you be able to use the gift alone as a down payment if it is under 20% I think the answer is yes for some lenders. But this might limit the types of loans available if you are providing 0% yourselves.  2) I don't think you would need his bank statements from MY experience but you will definitely need a letter/form signed by him and/or pictures of the cleared check.  3) Typically you don't start your paperwork with the lender until you are under contract or at least submitting an offer. Therefore you will have the property address by then.  4) You can start the pre approval process then.  Just know that every lender has different requirements or penalties for every situation so I would definitely shop around.

(My understanding is no bank wants a house to go to foreclosure and would rather offer a payoff at a lesser amount possibly)   ""Stop paying your mortgage for X months so you can get the lender to agree to a short sale!"" is a complete crap shoot, and where this question invariably leads.   $10k financed at 4% is like $50/month. You're risking the entire house to speculate on possibly saving $50/month, and thinking of trashing grandma's credit in the process. That's a shitty bet, my friend, so pick a new question. :)   How detailed does the contract need to be and what do we need to make sure is in it?   Go find a realtor and tell her she is going to get 2% commission for the easiest deal in her entire career. If your grandmother is like my grandmother then she is utterly sexist against female realtors, so you would have to pick a male realtor.   What are somethings we definitely need to check into to make sure we get the best rate and don't create a big mess?   You were talking about risking the entire house for maybe $50/month, earlier. A quarter of a percent in interest rate difference on $90k is about $15/month. Everyone is going to offer you something in the low 4s this month, provided your credit is decent. Just pick the person that is going to place the least stress on your grandmother and you.   How can we have extra money after the sale for repairs and changes we want to make to the house?   HELOC."

That is a lot of work to trust to a receipt.   As far as the timeline, I think they are using the second inspection as a sort of informal final walkthrough prior to closing. It's possible that they did not want to do the inspection 1.5 months early in case some new issue arises in the time before they close.

Are you getting to the listings the minute they hit the market?  Are you providing the prequalification letter with the offer? Would  fixer upper be something you are wiling to take on-if there are any available? Have you tried putting an offer in that is structured as ""$1,000 over best offer, not to exceed $xxx,xxx?"
RealEstate,3ag7nx,landofmisfits,5,Fri Jun 19 22:07:25 2015 UTC,"My agent thinks the answer is to just keep plugging away, making offers.

I check them every thirty seconds, it seems like.  Always giving prequalify action letter with the offer. I'm okay with a cosmetic fixer-upper. More than that scares me a bit, because I don't really know anything about it, and I'm afraid of getting in over my head.  My realtor does not like escalation clauses. She says they make sellers mad, because we didn't put in our best offer right away. This does not make a lot of sense to me, but I've gone along with it so far. But that doesn't seem to be working for me."
RealEstate,3ag7nx,sir_prints_alot,3,Fri Jun 19 22:18:51 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you might need a new realtor.  I'm not necessarily saying that you're realtor isn't good at what they do, but they might not be the right one for what you need.  Shop around for another realtor.  2 things come to mind.  Find one that specializes in working with 1st time buyers.  Find one that is on the winning side of these home sales/purchases.  The larger your down payment, the more serious the seller knows you are.  Pre-qualification is great, but I'll take a 20-30% downpayment offer way more seriously than a 5% offer, as those larger downpayment offers successfully close more often.  Good luck."
RealEstate,3ag7nx,caiuschen,3,Sat Jun 20 01:49:50 2015 UTC,"In Seattle, it seems like escalation clauses are pretty normal in a multiple offer scenario--which is currently nearly every house.  If you escalated in $5k increments, how likely do you think their pride and anger will overwhelm their desire for an additional $5k?  My wife and I are currently under contract, and I'm quite happy to have set up an escalation clause.  Our initial offer was above list, but it escalated to a bit higher than that, but a a good amount below our limit.  Without an escalation clause, we would have either not gotten our offer chosen or paid tens of thousands more than we needed to.  If it's cash offers that are beating you, though, having more % down and escalating by more than $1k increments would probably help.  As others have mentioned, a low % down means that the loan is more likely to fail, particularly if the house fails to appraise.  If you are only $1k more than a all-cash offer, the seller may not feel that the risk is worth the additional $1k."

That being said, I would never want someone to spend above their comfort level either, so many expenses don't count toward a mortgage qualification.  Is your realtor available enough, and are you available enough to get physically to the properties as soon as you see one you like online?  Have you expanded your search to an area that is maybe not a worse neighborhood, but a little further from your ideal neighborhood?  Unfortunately there is no way to know what a competing buyer is going to do, or how badly they want the property."

I was very sad that I couldn't find another $200k for her to top $40m/month and set a West Coast record.  The more competent you are, the more you are the boss of us loan officers. When J tells me something is needed, I do not question it for a single moment.   T is who some of my deals get spread-loaded to when J is at capacity. T is awesome, don't get me wrong. Her speed is on-point. She makes mistakes once in a great while, so I still question her from time to time and say 'no, I'm not asking the client for that.' The reason I still say 'no' to her is because I am right when we disagree almost all the time -- it will go to underwriting, not be an issue, and that's that.  I am never vindicated with J. When she says it is needed, it is needed. Period. When she doesn't, it isn't. I can treat her ""it's ready for clear-to-close"" as just as good as confirmation from underwriting. I cannot treat J's ""it's ready"" e-mail the same as an ""it's ready"" from underwriting, by contrast.  Also, you need 3 monitors. Go steal them from around the office, along with the adapters.   You also need an IV that feeds caffeine directly into your veins. Your fellow processors will tell you where to get that.

I have a friend who fell into a job as a processor for a mortgage broker. Like u/aardy's processor, she kept him in line. Big companies had been trying to recruit him for years because he was a high volume guy. One day he agree to go to one of the big banks if he could bring her along. Big bank agreed and hired them both.   Within a month, big bank found this guy doing something shady and fired him on the spot (we never found out what). But by then they were so impressed by my friend they made her the loan officer and she took over all the files in process and was given her own processor. Turns out she was really good at the sales, marketing, and networking needed to be a loan officer and she did really well.

RealEstate,3agmhi,iphoneanonymous,3,Sat Jun 20 00:10:56 2015 UTC,"Here's a recent thread I posted about this.   You have to find someone to train you. They aren't going to pay you shit, you will be their competition.   You can be the most thorough, analytically inclined, hard working appraiser there ever was but if you come in ""low"" for a client you have done your last job for them. Even good clients will bail on you if you kill a deal they really needed. You will constantly be churning through new clients. Lenders (and most homeowners) don't really want an honest, thorough appraisal, they want one that gives them the number they want to see (and this does not always have a basis in reality of what the house is worth, but is based on what their loan requirements are).  When I first started appraising, I thought, who cares, if people pressure me, I'm honest and have integrity and I'm not going to let people talk me into LYING so they make a bunch of money (exponentially more than me). I'm the one with the license that I worked damn hard to get, and the liability, I'm the one who can be sued for years after I do this report, I'm the one who will stand my ground. And I did. But that wears you down, you get sick of it after a while. I've been called every name in the book and a few I never even heard by lovely looking realtors in nice professional looking clothing. I had a realtor cuss me out up one side of a wall and down the other because I wouldn't call his enclosed patio THAT STILL HAD A DIRT FLOOR AND NO HEAT ""living space."" And guess who he was selling that house to? His MOTHER. I'm like, you would sell your mother a house with a damn dirt floor but I'm the schmuck? Ha ha. It doesn't just happen once in a while, it happens every day. I'll send you this order if you can guarantee me $X dollars. That kind of stuff. It happens less now after the crash. But it hasn't gone away.   Here's a link to how much money you will really need to make:  http://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/36nfn1/why_dont_home_sellers_get_an_appraisal_done/crhg9q6?context=3  If you do it, don't even attempt this unless you want to go into commercial. Residential is just not worth the hassle and the liability for the money. Also you might read this site (you might have to register but this guy is the best real estate liability expert in the country and it's not spammy or anything) http://www.appraiserlawblog.com/ If you do get licensed don't buy insurance from any other company, that's the best one."
RealEstate,3agmhi,wamazing,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:49:07 2015 UTC,"That's a lot of question. Appraisers are people who value property, from single family homes to skyscrapers. What type of property do you think you are interested in?  The first step is to take the basic courses for a trainee license. If you go to the Appraisal Institute's site you can look up courses in your area.   The next step is funding a certified appraiser to work with and learn from.   It will take time before you start making real money, but with experience and drive you can make a good living. If you can make connections with attorneys and lenders along the way and start your own shop, down the road you can earn even more."

To become an appraiser, you need pre-licensing classes, then an apprenticeship with a licensed or certified appraiser.  It's harder to make money in residential.  The reports are typically simpler.

RealEstate,3aguvv,ghostiami,3,Sat Jun 20 01:36:17 2015 UTC,"my question to you guys is what things do i need to look out for when doing this.   Your home owner's insurance will probably cover any liability, but check your policy and run the scenario past them. Consider splitting the utility costs in 1/3rds.   what are good ways to help protect myself from bad tenants (may i require they bring in a credit check when applying)   There are online services that will run a background, credit, and prior rental history check. It costs about $30 and you can make the tenant pay this as part of their application fee.   where should i go to get a lease drawn up (lawyer?)   A realtor can probably help you, although your public library probably has tons of books with sample leases. Try to find one specific to your state and read and understand it.   what are some things i should put in the lease that i may not be thinking of.   Get a deposit, be sure its clear what they have to pay for in case of repairs. Parking - where do they get to park their car.  Also, guests and parties.  Basically put together some house rules on paper so they know what to expect."
RealEstate,3aguvv,soyconyo,2,Sat Jun 20 02:00:37 2015 UTC,"Definitely split the utilities, otherwise the tenants have no incentive not to waste the water/gas/electricity you are paying for. Believe me you'll be sorry come December if you don't make them responsible for their share."

RealEstate,3afvy0,ritchie70,6,Sat Jun 20 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"Buying a duplex would be buying the whole building and collecting rent on the other unit.    It sounds to me like you are buying an attached single family home.  If that is the case and it is unusual in your area, it will likely be harder to sell when you are ready, hence why it is a good value for comparable size unattached properties.  When you sell, you will likely have to sell at a good value (for the buyer) as well.  Whether it is a good deal or not depends on your market, what price you are buying it at, and what your expectation of appreciation is.  Have you asked your realtor this question?"
RealEstate,3aeemf,speedoflife1,7,Fri Jun 19 13:18:13 2015 UTC,"Their requirements seem reasonable to me, given that you should be maintaining reserves like that anyway in the event of major repairs, vacancies, etc.  Just because each unit is net positive today doesn't mean you can't quickly get underwater if a few units end up vacant and needing massive repairs.  Suppose you purchase this new unit and shell out your 30% down payment (which is only 5% higher than you were paying before), and you have a massive water leak.  Suddenly, the lack of reserves means you can't repair the units, can't keep tenants, and then can't make the insurance or loan payments.  A few small issues can end up snowballing very quickly, tenants are fickle, and the bank wants to make sure their investment (the loan) is protected, too.  As far as getting financing:  Do you have access to any lines of credit?  Perhaps an open line of credit that's cross-collateralized with your existing units?  That's how we generally buy, when we don't want to tie up our reserves while waiting for a loan.  We'll purchase a distressed property using the line of credit, pull funds for repairs/improvements from LOC or our reserves, and then apply for the loan once the house is rehabbed...we'll borrow less than 80% LTV, pay off our LOC and deposit the remainder into the checking account to use as reserves, to reimburse our repair bills, etc."
RealEstate,3aeemf,craigeryjohn,3,Fri Jun 19 16:36:09 2015 UTC,I only have 4 properties but my sister now has 12 properties. She uses a home equity line of credit to purchase and rehab distressed properties. After rehab she then uses a commercial line of credit to refi the property at around 70% of ARV and pulls every dime she has invested in the propery and pays off the home equity line of credit. She generally clears about $250 to $500/month per property after expenses.  Originally she would refi with an individual mortgage on each property but after about 7 properties she refied all the properties into a single commercial line of credit.
RealEstate,3aeemf,jmd_forest,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:43:39 2015 UTC,"Do you have any insight into the interest rates for lines of credit secured against property? What your sister is doing makes sense, but the rates I've seen seem prohibitively expensive, compared to standard mortgages."

RealEstate,3aeemf,underwriter1,4,Fri Jun 19 15:47:46 2015 UTC,Look into First Key. They're about 6.5%. They don't care how many properties you own.

RealEstate,3aeemf,thisrandomlife,1 point,Sat Jun 20 11:35:48 2015 UTC,And higher. Residential loans with a low interest rate with 30 year maturities aren't a natural free market product and was designed and supported to encourage homeownership in the US. It allows for small time investment for the 'average man' but not bigger enterprises of 10+ properties. Personally I think Fannie went on a bit of a leap letting people finance up to 10 investment properties.. in theory a person could finance 4.17m REO debt through Fannie at a residential interest rate.
RealEstate,3aeemf,BreezyMcWeasel,5,Sun Jun 21 23:17:02 2015 UTC,Look up portfolio lenders.  Your local community banks will have them.  They keep the loans in house and do not sell them on a secondary market so they will not have the tight requirements that normally come with conventional loans.  Make sure to bring a lot of proof about your properties so prove that you are a good investment.
RealEstate,3aeemf,yeahright17,2,Fri Jun 19 20:35:54 2015 UTC,"This is a good idea, one of my previous loans ended up being kept in house. Do mortgage brokers not have access to this information though? I thought the point of having a broker vs going straight to the bank was that he could find banks doing portfolio loans. Maybe i need a new broker? He said he looked at 7 different lenders and they all had the same or stricter guidelines."
RealEstate,3aeemf,zfl,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:44:34 2015 UTC,"I am not sure.  Maybe it's because local banks might want to ""vet"" the loan themselves.  Your best bet would be to look for some local banks in your community. Just a heads up portfolio lenders generally  have higher interest rates."
RealEstate,3aeemf,zfl,3,Sat Jun 20 04:19:26 2015 UTC,"I have > 4 properties.   FNMA rules are indeed different for more than 4 financed properties,  but last I checked it was 25% down and 6 months of reserves on each financed property.    As for reserves, my mortgage company uses stocks, bonds, mutual funds, including IRAs and 401k balances as part of the reserves.  They don't use 100% of the amount in those accounts. There is a formula.  70% perhaps, whereas bank accounts would count as 100%.  This way if you have a healthy retirement account you can use that balance to help meet the reserve requirements.    There is also a 1.25% delivery fee, which can be paid as closing costs or over the life of the loan with a small rate increase.    As for 30% that may be your lender's own requirement (unless FNMA underwriting rules changed lately).  See the latest FNMA Selling Guide to get the most up-to-date rules from.    I hope this helps."

If you want to get involved in commercial real estate you need to sign up for an account on Loopnet or contact a commercial real estate agent that specializes in an asset class you want to specialize in. Probably apartment buildings in your case. That's where most residential real estate investors move into because it's the most similar.

Economy of scale, easier to manage a 10 unit apartment building than 10 houses; lower maintenance costs per unit etc.  Loans are ""easier"" as credit is based on the asset, not your personal expenses.  No limit on loans because again, credit is based on the asset, not your personal credit.  Raising money, partnerships easier.  A con might be the higher down payment requirement usually 30-35% and also replacement reserves are sometimes required.

Not trying to be rude to the OP but I guess I should clarify my previous statement. Great deals aren't found on the MLS or craigslist. Since you have 4 properties, you have proven that you are not a newbie and are willing to pull the trigger. You either need to get on a wholesale list or use the above links to start finding non-MLS owner finance or Subject To deals. I am on a few private lists, and here is a deal that I just got yesterday for a non-MLS seller finance property. I get anywhere from 4-10 of these emails per day, all non-MLS deals in various price ranges.  As far as commercial properties, OP commented that 'There arent any in my area for sale! Unless they arent listed on MLS.' Bullshit. Commercial and apartment buildings are always for sale, but they  won't ever have a for sale sign out and aren't listed on the MLS. Why would they? All it does is cause confusion and churn for your tenants and 99% of average joes who drive by aren't investors and can't meet the qualifications anyway. You need a certain financial profile to even be considered and brokers have private lists they email these listings to. Even Loopnet and CityFeet only have  leftover listings that brokers couldn't sell to their client lists.   If you are looking for deals that offer creative financing instead of going the conventional route, I suggest that you start by joining your local REI club/Meetup group if you haven't. Here you will meet wholesalers, landlords, agents, brokers, note investors, and everyone else. This is where you make contacts and get wind of upcoming deals once you have established yourself. You can't sit at home and wait for the deals to come to you because every investor in your area is doing the same thing. I know it's a lot more work, but this is what I mean when I say you have to make your own deals instead of waiting for them to come to you."

RealEstate,3aej2o,wipersniper,8,Fri Jun 19 13:58:52 2015 UTC,"My advise -   1) Contact a mortgage broker, get pre-qualified, and really nail down what you can feasibly afford.    2) Look for houses / condo's UNDER that price.  Many people will look at or just around / above their price range and it gets you in trouble and / or gets your hopes up for something you can not afford.  3) Don't take into consideration any income you would get from renting the other room, as you will ALWAYS get screwed out of rent and you don't want to be put in a position to not be able to afford your place by yourself.     4) If you work with your agent for buyers representation allow them to show you a limited number of homes, narrow your search yourself to avoid looking at too many properties, this causes more anxiety and makes deciding on something very difficult.    Just my 2 cents"
RealEstate,3aej2o,INeverPutMyRealName,2,Fri Jun 19 14:56:39 2015 UTC,"I pretty much agree with all this. One more thing to add.

I say this for multiple reasons.  1) Credit unions are owned by their members.  They are not going to try to screw you.  2) Credit unions often offer better interest rates and their fees are typically lower, because they don't have any Wall Street shareholders demanding profits.  3) Finally, this is something that few know about or understand, but if you close your mortgage with a credit union, you don't have to pay Georgia's Intangible Tax Recording Fee, this will save you $1.50 per every $500 of your loan.

The collecting officer shall determine from the face of the security instrument the date of execution of the instrument, the maturity date of the note, and the principal amount of the note. There is imposed on each instrument an intangible recording tax at the rate of $1.50 for each $500.00 or fraction thereof of the face amount of the note secured by the recording of the security instrument. The collecting officer shall collect the tax due on the security instrument from the holder of the instrument; provided, however, the holder may pass on the amount of such tax to the borrower or mortgagor but the amount of such tax passed to the borrower or mortgagor shall not be considered or treated as part of any finance charge imposed by the holder in connection with the loan transaction. If the security instrument reflects an amount greater than the principal amount of the note and, at the time the security instrument is presented for recording, the holder of the note also presents for recording with the security instrument said holder's sworn statement itemizing the principal amount of the note and the other charges included within the amount shown on the face of the security instrument, the collecting officer shall determine the principal amount of the note from the sworn statement. The maximum amount of any intangible recording tax payable as provided in this Code section with respect to any single note shall be $25,000.00.

RealEstate,3aej2o,midnitewarrior,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:53:49 2015 UTC,I agree with I neverputmyname-      Get prequalified- no reason to even start looking until you know for how much contact your Realtor friend (you can do this at the same time as #1)-  your Realtor friend will love that you contacted him to purchase a home its how he makes money and you know you can trust him. When looking narrow down your search- for ex: 3bd/2ba SFR homes with a garage in zip code xxxxx .   Then start looking and putting in offers.   Good luck!
RealEstate,3aej2o,bettertomorrowgroup,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:14:58 2015 UTC,I know a bunch of agents in the Atlanta area and a few managing brokers. What part of town are you looking at and I could send some referrals if you're interested.
RealEstate,3aej2o,malson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:25:26 2015 UTC,"North of I-20, not over by Decatur, Avondale Estates or Emory (it's nice, but it's too hard for me to get to all the things I normally do). So that leaves everything else. I liked Cross Creek, that seemed like it'd be in my range."
RealEstate,3aej2o,WinnieThePig,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:11:53 2015 UTC,"I'm in the process of buying in the Atlanta area.  Is there a reason you want to stay in the perimeter?  You will pay a lot more in everything, including taxes.  Where about do you work?  If you aren't on the north end (north of buckhead) I'd suggest looking south around the Tyrone, Palmetto, or even Douglasville areas.  You can get some easy SFH that are 3/2 for your price range.  It's a little longer of a commute to midtown, but you can afford more.  I'm going to be buying in the Newnan/Sharpsburg/Senoia area.  My wife and I both work out of the airport area, so it's only a 30-40 minute commute.  I'd also suggest redfin.  That's who I am using right now.  That's who I will be using in the future when I start investing in the area.  They will get you into a house usually the same day.  There is no contract until you draw up a purchase agreement.  You get a refund at purchase from redfin that is a % of the purchase price.  I'm looking in the 200k range and it's about $1000.  Only thing of note with redfin is that you will have to bring the homes to them.  They won't usually spend time finding a home for you.  It can be a double edged sword if you don't know what you're looking for.  It also means you'll only see houses that you want to see.  Next question...do you have access to becoming a member at Delta Community Credit Union?  They are offering great 100% loans right now that wave origination fees and don't require PMI for the entirety of the loan.  You could escape from start to finish with about $4000 cash to buy a 140k home with payments right around 1000 per month.    Do get pre-qual'd.   That will give you a lot of power.  Just because you get pre-qual'd for 150k doesn't mean you have to buy a 150k place.  I am pre-qual'd for 325 and we are buying around 200.  However, if you are going to rent a bedroom to a friend, that will help offset the mortgage, which is always a great thing to do.  Start looking now.  September will be here before you know it.  If you have any questions, let me know."

Regardless of whether or not you choose Redfin, I highly recommend their website.  They have the most up-to-date information about homes on the market, they update their listings many times a day.  Other web sites have older information, Zillow being one of the worst.  A bonus for going with Redfin is that they will pay you a rebate when you close.  I went with them and they were very professional and took me on about a dozen home viewings before I found the house I wanted.  They have a whole office of people to help you go on viewings with and their most experienced people are the ones that help you make the offers.

They think their property is the only listing I have and expect me to spend 100% of my time working on their listing.  They expect every business that looks at their property to lease it and if the property was not right for a prospect then I did something wrong.  They come up with wild ideas for tenants for their properties and expect me to land them no matter what.  After being told 20 times that Cheesecake Factory has no interest in the city of their property they still expect you to check back with them weekly to see if they have changed their mind."
RealEstate,3aenx9,Corbanis_Maximus,6,Fri Jun 19 15:25:55 2015 UTC,"I had a office owner client tell us (after the listing was signed) he expected us to give a weekly update with no less than 20 contacts then a follow up conference call to discuss status.  It was like a maybe 75k sf office complex with most suites in the 1-3k sf range.    We did one deal where the entire unit was hit to shit the owner wanted to negotiate TI down to like the tiniest detail.  The tenant didn't even want much, I think like they wanted a month or two to compensate them for fixing stuff that should of already been fixed.  The owner wanted to know if they could do things like place curtains to cover holes in walls and stuff.    We made it a month in to that cluster fuck, closed that one deal, had another fall apart because the owner wanted to knitpick everything possible and screw the prospect, then he started ripping into us about not being proactive enough and we basically said ""hey we've had this for a month.  we've done like 10 property tours, closed a lease, and would of closed this one if you made just the slightest compromises.  If you aren't happy we can cancel the listing and we all move on"".    He did.  I think there has been 4 different brokers on that property in the last couple years.  During that month he managed to fly out to see me twice in person to discuss.  And despite that level of micromanagement, we never even got floor plans to market the spaces, nor really knew for sure all the vacancies because their rent rolls were so fucked up.

The ADA and my lack of knowledge about how they deal with marijuana is the only reason I didn't try to react to it. The only thing I did was demand to see his card because I don't want to get in trouble if he was caught possessing it. You can smell it the minute he opens the door, but I'll take a break where I can get one: it doesn't smell like he's smoked it inside.

If it wasn't weed, something tells me this guy would have fucked something up somehow, anyways. There are tons of respectful, quiet, awesome people that are MMJ patients. You're well within your rights to outlaw smoking in your premises, as well as production of cannabis concentrates, but be any more blatant than that and you're not just asking from trouble from ADA/equal housing types, you're kind of being a dick, too.  Also, kind of a subtle fuck you for demanding to see the guys MMJ card. That's a legal issue, and not one for you to worry about. The correct response, if you thought he was doing something truly illegal, was to contact the authorities and let them hash it out.  He obviously didn't need to show it to you, and frankly if it was me I would have told you to fuck off. That's akin to asking someone for any type of health record. And you're also not going to have access to whether people have a card or not when they apply. It's a separate database, and asking if they have a card could very well be illegal.  TLDR; chill out. it wasn't a pot head that fucked up your deck, it was an idiot. they come in all shapes and sizes, so don't be a discriminatory dick who stereotypes 'stoners'."

You may want to check if your state offers any type of home buyer credit though.  More info here:   http://www.irs.gov/uac/First-Time-Homebuyer-Credit-1

I'm not real sure how all of this works cause our mortgage company freaking ignores me every time I ask about it. But you might have more competent people who will know!!   Good luck on your closing!!
RealEstate,3afl66,vcolon15,2,Fri Jun 19 18:59:30 2015 UTC,"Not a broker, but there are many of these referral companies around. Lead companies solicit home buyers and sellers on the net by offering them cash back if they use one of their agents to buy or sell.  They solicit agents by offering 'solid leads' for a 30% referral fee.  They don't tell the sellers that they could have just negotiated a discount from the agent themselves, and saved everybody money.  Instead, the sellers find that the agent assigned to them is reluctant to spend big money promoting the property because they are already getting crushed on commission.  Nobody wins, except the Lead Company."

RealEstate,3afjty,DEEPfrom1,3,Fri Jun 19 18:48:29 2015 UTC,"St. Louis Realtor here. I can only really speak for myself, but I love this market. Stl is extremely diverse. There are 79 different neighborhoods within the City of St. Louis. St. Louis County stretches out covering urban, and more rural areas. I have been a realtor for almost a year here (I'm in my 20's) and thanks to a great Brokerage and team, I have had quite a bit of success. As a realtor, your mother knows that it takes a lot of hard work and commitment, so she should be prepared for some competition. I work for a branch of RE/MAX. [pm me if you want more specific details and contact information] My brokerage has been very supportive and encouraging, while not getting in my way. I am my own boss and I choose my schedule, my clients, my leads, etc...  Right now, the market is booming! There is a really low inventory on the market and demand is UP. Houses are selling very quickly and it's a great time to sell. A lot of homes are actually getting under contract before they even hit the market. There are various groups of realtors around here that share their ""coming soons"" with each other and a large portion of those are sold before they hit the MLS.   I only had a minute to write this up, but if you have any other questions or specifics you'd like to know about, let me know and I'll check back later to respond."

RealEstate,3aevu6,Bumbaclaat,2,Fri Jun 19 16:21:09 2015 UTC,One way to look at it:  it might make your life easier if you can move on your terms and time table instead of one imposed on you by the new owner
RealEstate,3aevu6,zooch76,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:09:48 2015 UTC,Cash for keys is doubtful because they just need to give you 30 days notice.  I'd say your best bet is to wait and see what the buyers intend to do with the property and go from there.
RealEstate,3aevu6,landofmisfits,2,Fri Jun 19 17:09:01 2015 UTC,"It often depends who the buyer is.  Locally most sheriff's auctions end up going back to the bank.  This is probably the only scenario that you would be offered cash for keys.  Some banks are also continuing to allow the rental, it just gets paid to the bank or property management for the bank.  It also depends on local laws and how quickly the new owner moves forward, some banks don't even do anything with a property for months after sheriff's sale.  The down side to this is that there is no one maintaining the property during this time.  Let me know if you have any questions, I am a realtor that list foreclosures for the bank.  However my only expertise is in my local market."
RealEstate,3aevu6,zooch76,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:08:06 2015 UTC,How much time is left on your lease?  The new owners must honor it or compensate you to leave (and you must agree).
RealEstate,3aevu6,loki8481,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:16:06 2015 UTC,"if you have a lease, you're safe until it expires, although the new buyers may potentially offer you cash to move out early.  otherwise, I'd start looking around for a new place but it may or may not be necessary in the end... really depends on the new buyers and if they just want to take over an existing revenue stream or if they want to kick everyone out, remodel the building, and jack up rent prices (if they think your local market can support it)"
RealEstate,3aevu6,Vogeltanz,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:20:26 2015 UTC,"For all practical purposes, I don't think there's any need to move out early. The purchaser of the building may want to keep you as a tenant for the monthly cash flow.  If you're worried that the rug will be pulled out from under you, feel free to start looking at other rentals now. You're in a month to month lease. If you find something you really like, you'll be free to take it.  Good luck!"

The best one is a big yellow book called Landlording. My business partner and I talked about long term goals, short term goals, and expectations at length.   we identified a location and started looking, we found a place that was already on the MLS for a few weeks, a 4-family with 2 units that were 2 bed and 2 units that were one bed.  Asking price of $110k. We negotiated them down to $103k, inspections went smooth.  Went to closing, talked to the owner a little bit.  Turns out he was a younger guy who had inherited all of his property and (quite obviously) blew a ton of his inheritance. we decided to take the property with the current tenants, made sure they were all on month to month leases so that in the worst case scenario, we could get rid of them after 30 days. Turns out that the tenants are actually pretty good.  The one lady takes extremely good care of her place, and so does the one guy.  The tenants upstairs take fairly good care of their place as well and we did not have that many surprises upon taking ownership.  The biggest surprise is that we don't own any of the stoves/refrigerators in the upstairs apartments, or any of the washers/dryers in the basement.   In the 5 months that we've had the building we put 2 new stoves in, fixed a bunch of very minor things, put a new medicine cabinet in the one apartment, new wall plates in the one apartment and a bunch of other little things.  Total repairs/expenses so far are approx $1200 but I think we've got most things taken care of so I expect the expenses to go down quite a bit. Total monthly income is $2270, PITI is $950.  Utilities runs from $400-$600 depending on what time of the year it is.   very satisfied with everything, looking at purchasing another one very soon.      edit: Interesting twist, we had a tenant report yesterday that they thought they might have bed bugs..We had Orkin out today and they sure do.  That sucks, we're going to get the whole building treated just to be safe.  $900 bill but we'll have the tenant that brought the bugs in (they just bought used furniture) pay for part of that."

RealEstate,3aa1rq,ReaverKS,5,Fri Jun 19 00:28:05 2015 UTC,"It's easier to keep track of things if we own all of the appliances in the building.  Plus when the tenants move out we assume they'd take their appliances with and we'd have to get our own appliances anyways.  We didn't raise rents at all, I think the rents are either fair market, or maybe 5% low."

Besides all the dough you put in, can you estimate how many hours (maybe an average, per week) you put into this? And now that the worst is behind you, how many hours do you expect to put in, going forward?   Did you have a contractor doing the rehab for you or are you DIY?  Would love to hear what kind of trouble the tenants you evicted were causing, were they just late on rent or was it worse than that?   Were you able to find another job in the middle of this? Did your job loss make it easier (in that you could spend more time on your building) or harder because of the financial pressure?   If your luck hadn't been so good, and we weren't in the middle of a market upswing and the appraisal had come in lower, would that change your plans going forward? Would you think about bailing and just trying to get your money back or would you still be in it for the long haul?  Thanks for posting this, I think it's an eye-opener for the crowd that thinks property investing is so easy (same crowd that thinks realtors unlock a door and collect a check).

RealEstate,3aa1rq,Crestylia,7,Thu Jun 18 13:44:41 2015 UTC,"While I was employed, I spent all day, every Saturday at the house doing work or supervising. Plus a few hours during the week when little things came up.    After I got fired, I spent 50 hours a week with my dad doing the rehab work to save on costs. Having a job would have been easier bc I would have hired contractors to do the job. When I'm employed I work in finance, so I earn more than what a contractor costs.  Now I'm back to work and most of the heavy lifting is done, I want to cut the time spent to a few hour every other week. I'm officially outsourcing all the maintenance to my dad in exchange for a $1000/month property management fee.     I would say that contractors + my dad did the majority of the work, but that was a struggle in itself. I'm actually suing the first contractor I worked with. Most of the other ones also didn't finish the job in time or to my standard. We worked with 5-6 different contractors over the 9 months and I would only classify one of them as good, not great.   I attribute the low success rate to us not having a network of qualified contractor contacts, a labor shortage in my city, and wage inflation ($250-$400 seems to be the going daily rate per contractor).  I don't know how to answer the question of what I would do had I ""failed"". I don't think it was luck - the neighborhood is rapidly gentrifying due to an ""NYC style High Line"" investment. Even if the property value didn't meet my expected price, the rental income would still be there (+/- 10%). As evidence, my current all in cost is ~$330k and my projected gross annual rent is $65k. Had the appraisal been based on a Gross Rent Multiplier it would have been valued at $562k.  I wouldn't sell it for a penny below $600k. Monthly cash flow (post PITI) is projected to be $2500.    Under the framework on reaching financial independence, this property is a quantum leap forward for me (before the purchase my net worth was under $50k). That said, not sure if I would but another investment property. I'm a terrible contractor and I don't like dealing with people. My saving grace is I'm great with number and a unemotional investor.  I don't mean to come off as cocky, but, again, I'm an investor at heart and I ""knew"" I had a winner in hand. I could be wrong on the timing, but not the direction. In that case, I just wait it out."

My dad did a lot of the work bc he also lost his job during this process too and my parents dug into their savings to fund $30k of the reno. I agree that they were of great help, but they are neither wealthy nor would I have been sunk without them. If they were wealthy, I would not be paying/giving my dad $1000/month.  The property was breaking even with 2-units rented out and I could have kept the other 2 units vacant until I saved the money I needed for the rehab.    The quality of an investment is based on when the seeds are sown not at the time of harvest. The deal was a winner day 1 bc of purchase price and neighborhood selection.  Agree to disagree."

A lot of the online resources only talk about the upside of these adventures.   Evicting tenants is the WORST! I do have some experience with that and so much of the law is on their side it takes forever and they usually trash the place too. Ugh. Best wishes with turning the place over to all good tenants!

RealEstate,3aa1rq,catjuggler,19,Thu Jun 18 14:04:22 2015 UTC,"During the process, I learned that the property was a recovery home and some at least 3/4 units were former alcoholics or drug addicts.    He seller could only show a verified rent roll for 2 of 4 units.    Both evictions were due to the tenants not wanting to pay the rent. First one was relatively easy: 2-3 weeks of yelling, $100 bribe, and I paid for the moving truck.     The second one was a women who was a pathological liar and a total bitch. She made excuses for months trying to wait for winter to come. At one point I had offered her $1000 to move out and she countered at $1500. I told her to go fuck herself.

RealEstate,3aa1rq,mky737,9,Fri Jun 19 03:59:43 2015 UTC,This is why you  1) Never go all in on an illiquid investment (having no efund puts you at risk of being a slumlord)  2) Confirm all tenants are up to date on rent before closing  But I'm sure you know all that by now!  I'm not sure why you bothered to upgrade the apartments at this point.  I would have done the minimum to get them rented again if I didn't have the cash to upgrade.  This is a great post to help others considering purchasing and reaching farther than they should with their cash.
RealEstate,3aa1rq,TOMtheCONSIGLIERE,8,Thu Jun 18 14:31:25 2015 UTC,"1) This property was the best deal I had seen in two years and proved to be the last great deal in the neighborhood. For me, I decided the potential gain was too big to pass up so I choose to break those ""rules"".   2) As mentioned above, I tried to get the rents verified. Only got 2 of 4. I had talked to the other 2 tenants to get a sense of their character. They lied to me and I fell for it.  I tried but I was wrong.     3) I spent $25k per unit bc I wanted to attract a premium tenant. Avg 2 bed rent in the area is $1000, I'm getting $1300 with grade A tenants. Avg 3 bed rent is $1400 and I'm getting $1900 with grade B tenants."
RealEstate,3aa1rq,ajfa,7,Thu Jun 18 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"The risk was so high and you almost failed though!  I have to admit, I've done the same thing in the past, but it was only so bad as being broke and putting a washer and dryer on credit (0% interest) and using the rest of my cash to get the roof fixed to keep insurance.  I think you can assume that if the rent isn't verified, it's not happening.  It should be easy to verify if the tenant is paying.  Your extra 300/month is going to take a hundred months to pay back though and the improvements will depreciate.  So it's not clearly worth it.  I would have rather avoided going further in the hole (since your ability to get credit would get worse and worse and another emergency could be around the corner) and taken the 1000/month for a year so so to get back on my feet.  You and I are both lucky because it turned out okay when we broke the rules.  It very easily could have gone much worse.  What would have happened if a third tenant needed to be evicted sooner"

I was either going to spend $10k-$15k for a builder grade remodel or $15k-$20k for a quality rehab. My estimate payback is 2.5 years and I have higher quality tenants. Totally worth it.

The reality is that for most people, homes are the largest single investment they'll make. Most people liquidate 50% or more of their cash assets in order to make a downpayment on a home. Whether or not they are full-time real estate investors or landlords, going ""all in"" can pay off if you are confident you are getting a good property at a good price (rare these days), and have the reserves to weather storms.    A 4-plex is a particularly illiquid asset, which eats up a lot of time and in which a lot can go wrong. On the other end of the spectrum, I am embarking on a venture renting out a large SFR (an A- in an A neighorhood) to existing, stable tenants. Its rental income covers PITI for both that property and my current residence (which I owned in cash before). Barely-positive cash flow, but ROI and reserve numbers look great... time will tell if this is a good move compared to more cash-flow oriented investment strategies with B-/C properties. It's definitely a good move compared to keeping all my cash locked in one asset!"

I certainly do not envy a tenant whose landlord is missing mortgage payments and can't afford a handyman to fix a leaky faucet, let alone serious repair work.   On the other hand, the reserves needed for a slummy 4-plex in Chicagoland with high turnover are probably quite high, compared to a A/B SFR that has been well-maintained by owners and has few, low-turnover tenants. Ironically, the 4-plex would widely seen as a better investment by the numbers. Although, I wonder if that's just a side effect of lack of cheap B/C SFR's like the ones that foreclosed in 2009-2011."

Most investors I know have had some sort of backing to begin with -- not all of us started investing their first $5k in real estate at age 20 and ended up with $2M in assets a few years later due to sheer awesomeness.
RealEstate,3aa1rq,ajfa,3,Thu Jun 18 23:19:44 2015 UTC,Thank you.
RealEstate,3aa1rq,EnderWiII,2,Fri Jun 19 00:27:29 2015 UTC,What is your estimated cash flow now after you also factor in the refinance loan?
RealEstate,3aa1rq,EnderWiII,2,Thu Jun 18 14:00:03 2015 UTC,"High level P/L is: *  $5400 in gross rents  *  $1550 mortgage *  $750 property taxes and insurance *  $1000 property management (to my dad) *  $100 utilities *  $500 reserve, accrual, all other"

Otherwise those numbers look great to me ..... you're pocketing $1500/month after putting away $500 for reserves, right ?  You should have taken more out on the refi and reinvested it with your new knowledge of the market."
RealEstate,3aa1rq,wamazing,5,Thu Jun 18 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"Your math is correct - $1500 a month after reserve.     Yes, the market fee is closer to 7% but I'm paying more for three reasons: 1) he did a lot of work for free while I was broke 2) He is my dad and I can afford it 3) The money helps fund an early retirement (more like self-employment) for both my parents    I'm taking out the maximum - over $300k with the new mortgage. I need to pay off the existing mortgage ($180k) and my creditors ($75k). Can't do more for another year."

RealEstate,3aa1rq,ReaverKS,2,Thu Jun 18 17:00:04 2015 UTC,"Which neighborhood of Chicago are you in, if you don't mind me asking. I'm in Chicago and did something similar. The building we got had 3 units and it was a short sale because the last owner was basically a slum lord. My wife and I moved into one of the units (3 bedroom / 2 baths). PITI is $2700 a month, rental income is $2400. Which is still under market but we haven't fix a lot of stuff since moving in. Just bought a new stove for each unit at $500 each. We do however have a new back porch replacement coming in that's going to be around 15k. My dad has also been helping me out with minor fixes. But I did under estimate how much maintenance it was going to take to keep up with a building with multiple tenants. We were somewhat lucky because we have high paying jobs so there was always going to be a cushion (200k gross combined income). I was not as ballsy to go 100% in. 245k sounds like a good deal for a decent Chicago neighborhood. We paid 370k for ours. After all of that, would consider buying more investment properties? Was yours a short sale / foreclosure?"
RealEstate,3aa1rq,kegman83,2,Thu Jun 18 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"I won't be more specific than to say I bought something near the new 606 Trail.  But, it sounds like we have a lot in common so we can chat via PM.  Perhaps we can learn something from each other.  My sale was a traditional sale but the seller was going through a divorce, listed the property at a reasonable price, and I offered full price in the first week.  He lost over $100k on it.     I think I would do it again. I earned over $100k in equity in less than a year and have a cash cow that can spit out $1500-$2500 per month after PITI. I also see another $150k in upside over the next few year as the area continues to gentrify. So I acknowledge and am grateful that I've been compensated for my effort.    However, I don't know if I would add another property. My income is similar to yours (maybe we both work in finance too?) and another $2000/month is becoming more and more marginal. Meanwhile, my time is of ever increasing value."

RealEstate,3aa1rq,ajfa,2,Fri Jun 19 00:49:07 2015 UTC,"My Story:  Bought a fourplex for 320k two years ago. They told us that one of the tenants will move out before closing as they bought a house. By the closing, all 4 tenants wanted out.  The property was in the hottest part of the town but the previous owner didn't do shit in the 10 years he owned it. I realized the potential and became the GC and gutted all kitchens and bathrooms. The subs were hired from craigslist etc and they gave me the hardest time of my life. Had i done the remodel with a proper construction company, I would not have been able to afford the amount of remodeling we were able to do so i had no choice. My wife and I went through the worst time of our life. It was so bad that i am still unable to think about that time period. It gives me chills writing this out. But due to my involvement, I was able to find deals on top quality material and we remodeled 4 kitchens and 4 bathrooms in $35,000. Installed top of the line granite, maple cabinets, stainless appliances, tiled shower etc. Whoever came to see immediately fell in love with the property. Increased the rents from $750 per unit to $1,150 per unit. After mortgage and all expenses, I clear about $25k per year.  I built my network of subs (electricians, plumbers, carpenter, landscapist etc) and can leverage all that to build my portfolio.   However, I have realized that retail is not my forte. My wife and I have proper full time jobs and I don't like dealing with tenants. At this point, getting a property management company involved doesn't pay. They are crap anyways. If a tenant texts me asking to remind the mower to do the yard, even that bothers me.  I work in finance, so investing is something i know well. And here are my 2 cents about real estate.   Its highly cyclical. You got to buy properties in downturns. If you want to buy in a seller's market that we have today, the only way is to buy a shithole in a good area and fix it up yourself. There is no way you can buy a good property in good condition that makes sense risk/reward wise. There are way too many sharks out there who are ready to pay all cash. You need to have the personality to deal with little things. The stuff that breaks down is usually little and you will have a network to get it resolved but you need to be able to handle those things.    If the above two things are good, real estate is an amazing asset class."
RealEstate,3aa1rq,Boonpa,4,Sat Jun 20 02:07:59 2015 UTC,Did you do any research on bigger pockets or read any books on real estate before jumping in?  Why did you have to immediately replace the roof? Didnt your inspector see these issues?  Why did you go into this with all of your net worth? Did you need to buy immediately for some reason?
RealEstate,3aa1rq,middleofthemap,3,Thu Jun 18 13:45:11 2015 UTC,Good points.
RealEstate,3aa1rq,crunkadactyl,-4,Thu Jun 18 13:57:09 2015 UTC,"No internet research for three reasons: 1) I think that RE is generally an ""easy"" to understand business so one can logic through most things.  2) The #1 most important consideration in any investment is purchase price and I thought I had found a deal.  3) My dad is a landlord and I thought I had learned much via osmosis.  Both I and the inspector knew the roof and siding was a little rough but it probably could have lasted a few more years. I believe the insurance would have let me do patch work but I wanted to contribute to the beautification/gentrification so I replaced everything.  I went all in bc that's how much I needed to put in to buy he property. I thought it would be a winner so I put all my chips on the table to take advantage of the opp."
RealEstate,3aa1rq,SIcmart,6,Thu Jun 18 14:03:17 2015 UTC,"Reddit can be weird at times with the things that get upvoted and downvoted.  I'm sure it's because you said ""real estate is generally easy"" while you made the mistakes that you did but I get what you are saying.  With literally no previous knowledge of the industry, you were able to know a deal when you saw one.  Yes, you fucked up with the tenants but to me, those are details that can be taught.  Being able to spot deals is something that almost can't be taught.  You either have the touch or you don't.  Maybe you got lucky maybe you didn't.  I'm thinking the latter."
RealEstate,3aa1rq,Valisk,5,Thu Jun 18 16:27:06 2015 UTC,"That's why I put easy in quotes. I mean that the job is Intellectually straight forward...i.e. Relative to engineering/medical/investment...but it's not ""sit on the beach"" easy.    The day-to-day stuff is rough and I'm not really cut out for it. I'd rather pay people to get everything done. Part of that attitude is a function of my (lack of) handyman-ness and partially bc my value-add is picking the units, not managing them.   I also have a relatively  high income so I value my free time exceptionally high."

RealEstate,3acj8x,coloradothrowaway14,3,Fri Jun 19 00:16:12 2015 UTC,"If the zoning and lots size allows you can also build a house on the lot in the future if you decide to.  Then you already have a three car garage and can rent out the apartment or use it as a guest space or work space, etc."
RealEstate,3acj8x,tleb,3,Fri Jun 19 01:32:12 2015 UTC,"If it's what you want & you can feasibly pull it off, I say go for it. I personally have in the plans a 2 bedroom home with a 3-4 car garage. I plan on being there with my spouse for the foreseeable future. And if there ever comes a time that I need to sell it, I know that I won't have a large buying pool, but there will be at least a few others out there like me that will love it. I wouldn't expect to make a fortune, but it's what I want & I have the means to do it. So I plan on doing it. If it's truly what you want & you've done your homework & planning, go make it happen."
RealEstate,3acj8x,ShinyLightning,2,Fri Jun 19 00:55:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe someone will buy it for the garage. My friend just bought one to store his cars in. $1000/mo cash-flow from the 1BR would probably cover most of the costs. But in terms of selling, if it's nice and modern, there's a good market for it usually with young couples. Look at the number of one bedroom condos in your market and what they sell for - a 1 BR SFR with 3 car garage will sell for a premium over that."
RealEstate,3acj8x,underwriter1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:41:19 2015 UTC,I think it depends on where you live but would guess you would have an easier time selling or renting a 2br vs a 1. You could do a 2brx1ba which would save a bit on cost.
RealEstate,3acj8x,Daniellecnoel,1 point,Fri Jun 19 01:26:13 2015 UTC,Why not just build a house and then a shop? Being 23 I'm guessing you could rent out some other rooms to friends to cover the costs of the house... It would also be a lot more conventional and easier to sell.
RealEstate,3acj8x,snowhonkey1,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:25:03 2015 UTC,"I think it would be easy to sell, mainly because there is nothing out there like that. I have had several single guys basically looking for a giant garage and a tiny house, but everything is tiny garages and big houses.   EDIT: Make the garage doors tall -- like 12 ft to fit large trucks and tractors through, and you have a single mechanics dream house."
RealEstate,3acj8x,frazzledgobemouche,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:12:20 2015 UTC,It's less expensive to build up than out.
