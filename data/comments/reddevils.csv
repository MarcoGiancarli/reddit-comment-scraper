reddevils,3e2tgc,MrBenLad,45,Tue Jul 21 15:02:03 2015 UTC,"Hope so, I was pleased that he got up to try to finish the chance rather than complain to the ref."
reddevils,3e2tgc,The_Renovator,20,Tue Jul 21 15:14:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, the strength shown here is more about his mental toughness of being focused on the game rather than on winning the freekick."
reddevils,3e2tgc,lestat85,38,Tue Jul 21 15:31:11 2015 UTC,For some reason I forgot he was #11 and kept on looking at #44 thinking what strength.
reddevils,3e2tgc,fbgm_2,13,Tue Jul 21 15:20:12 2015 UTC,Probably because he hasn't played like #11 yet. Maybe soon.
reddevils,3e2tgc,Irishane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:04:46 2015 UTC,He played as #11 all his matches last season didn't he?
reddevils,3e2tgc,CakePicnic,15,Tue Jul 21 16:33:45 2015 UTC,"Yes but he hasn't lived up to the standard, he means."
reddevils,3e2tgc,TotalSHIT,2,Tue Jul 21 16:34:38 2015 UTC,"Oh of course, I misunderstood :)"
reddevils,3e2tgc,CakePicnic,27,Tue Jul 21 16:41:08 2015 UTC,"I'd be so happy if Januzaj, Wilson, Pereira and Depay forced their way into our starting 11 with good performances. Can't see it happening for all of them, but they all seem to have a massive ceiling.   Really happy with Januzaj and Shaw's attitude (regarding their training on holidays over the summer)"
reddevils,3e2tgc,jammybear,4,Tue Jul 21 15:19:54 2015 UTC,"Although based on the performance, Lingard had the least flair but he made the right decisions and did well on the right. I think out of all our attacking options, right wing is probably where we have the least depth and can have a breakthrough player from the academy. Januzaj still seems the best bet though."
reddevils,3e2tgc,kwonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:53:04 2015 UTC,It would be awesome if they all started one game one day. I can see Januzaj and Wilson getting alot of opportunities this season as well as Depay. I feel like Pereira may have to force himself into some game time this season. I have high hopes for Pereira he looks like class.
reddevils,3e2tgc,RealNiqqa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:41:29 2015 UTC,Memphis is already significantly better than Young. He should be starting.
reddevils,3e2tgc,dmindlin824,6,Tue Jul 21 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"I think he will prove to be better than Young, but statements like that are a bit premature. Drop young into the eredevisie and he'd absolutely tear it apart. Depay is unproven in the PL though. I reckon it'll take him a season or two to adapt."
reddevils,3e2tgc,jammybear,3,Tue Jul 21 18:13:30 2015 UTC,"Memphis was brought in to start. He's 21, which for a winger is an age where he has to start in order to develop properly. The eredivisie isn't like the Serie A, players can adapt quickly to the Prem."
reddevils,3e2tgc,dmindlin824,3,Tue Jul 21 18:20:39 2015 UTC,"He was bought to fight for his place. Nobody is guaranteed a spot. The eredevisie is a much much lower level than the premier league. Even Memphis, LVG and Blind have said that numerous times. Don't expect too much too soon from him."
reddevils,3e2tgc,jammybear,21,Tue Jul 21 18:37:41 2015 UTC,He should go like Ronaldo and drop the flair and turn into a goalscoring machine instead!
reddevils,3e2tgc,CosmicGravy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:14:04 2015 UTC,"I said when I saw it live, he took that shot very Ronaldo-esque."
reddevils,3e2tgc,bubztwenty7,15,Tue Jul 21 19:45:14 2015 UTC,That move was very van Persie-esque.
reddevils,3e2tgc,Ar-Curunir,6,Tue Jul 21 17:09:10 2015 UTC,Great spot. That's what I thought too.
reddevils,3e2tgc,epileptic_disco,3,Tue Jul 21 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"It might be the left-footedness or poor stream quality, but I felt that Januzaj had a near identical gait to Van Persie against Club America. I genuinely had to remind myself that RVP didn't play for us anymore. The way he gestures for the ball and does those little skips is strikingly similar."
reddevils,3e2tgc,Lord_Snugglesworth,11,Tue Jul 21 18:58:53 2015 UTC,People slammed down hard on him after the match - but if he'd had put that in we'd be claiming this is gonna be his breakout season and that his confidence is sky high.
reddevils,3e2tgc,daniam1,5,Tue Jul 21 15:31:49 2015 UTC,really ? haven't seen the comments but i thought he showed a lot of promise in that performance.He was very good and consistent .Perriera stole the show but Janu showed he can be competition and he seems better physically.physically. Perriera and Janu are so close right in term of ability and i hope they push each other to the first team.
reddevils,3e2tgc,reborned1996,2,Tue Jul 21 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"Just looking at that clip, did he play as ST last week? I remember someone doing an article about LVG wanting to convert him to a ST.   link: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3062396/Manchester-United-want-convert-Adnan-Januzaj-striker.html"
reddevils,3e2tgc,Aimson,2,Tue Jul 21 16:45:28 2015 UTC,Wilson and Januzaj played up top this game. He definitely played like one. No harm in having versatility. Depay and Januzaj from the wings with versatile striker like Rooney can make a really dangerous attack in the future. Something in the mold of el tridente in Barcelona and Rooney-Ronaldo-Tevez trio back in the day. So much less to worry about tactically when you have extremely talented front 3.
reddevils,3e2tgc,kwonster,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:58:13 2015 UTC,"I thought he played a very similar that Memphis played in the first half, behind the striker."
reddevils,3e2tgc,-onlyontuesdays,6,Tue Jul 21 19:23:16 2015 UTC,"I continue to say this, Januzaj is Ronaldo/Messi quality, don't be surprised if he gets there in a couple of seasons once he builds up his physique. Ronaldo was in a similar position when he joined us, and slowly grew to be the beast that he is today. I don't see why Januzaj can't take the same path."
reddevils,3e2tgc,trashmaker,15,Tue Jul 21 16:03:27 2015 UTC,"While I think Januzaj has the potential to be a really great player, Messi/Ronaldo is still a stretch IMO. He might be at a similar level to Ronaldo at the same age but improving from here on the way Ronaldo did is not something that even the most promising of prospects (like Januzaj) generally pull off. Still very excited about his new developments though!!"
reddevils,3e2tgc,SpaceCocoa,8,Tue Jul 21 16:14:17 2015 UTC,"I admire your optimism, but I just don't see it. Not ever. I think if he stays progressing we're looking at a player who will be one grade down from Hazard...and that's not bad. But he won't be Ballon d'Or standard. Obviously I hope I'm wrong but I haven't seen enough x-factor from him to prove otherwise."
reddevils,3e2tgc,Irishane,4,Tue Jul 21 16:07:03 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone is paying attention.  Januzaj has neither the low center of gravity (Messi, Hazard) nor the pace (Ronaldo, Hazard) required to reach that level.  In order to reach the level of the world's top 10 attackers, Januzaj will have to develop his strength and intelligence to make up the difference.  Adding some hustle and indefatigability a la Suarez would be nice too but I doubt he has the constitution for that."
reddevils,3e2tgc,waiting4myteeth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:49:22 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, I just think his maximum potential is around Messi/Ronaldo level, whether he reaches that is a different discussion altogether. I remain optimistic :)"
reddevils,3e2tgc,trashmaker,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:23:58 2015 UTC,where did you buy your crystal ball?
reddevils,3e2tgc,youngsaha,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:17:56 2015 UTC,"No crystal ball, just 20+ years of watching players develop from afar. I like to think I have a fairly good record. ;)"
reddevils,3e2tgc,Irishane,-1,Tue Jul 21 16:47:48 2015 UTC,ok
reddevils,3e2tgc,youngsaha,3,Tue Jul 21 17:12:51 2015 UTC,I think comparing him to bale is better if you remember bale in his early days.
reddevils,3e2tgc,mu4e-9,2,Tue Jul 21 17:25:02 2015 UTC,Indeed: I don't know how anyone who watched Ronaldo's early career could compare him to Januzaj.  Ronnie had both skill and pace to burn: it was his lack of footballing intelligence and poor end product that let him down.
reddevils,3e2tgc,waiting4myteeth,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:55:39 2015 UTC,Januzaj will be sold to another lesser club than Man U in 2 years or so

Interestingly enough, in my head I basically reverse it, I think of tall forwards like Bas Dost and Andy Carroll as centre forwards, whereas smaller forwards like Rooney and Aguero I think of as strikers"

reddevils,3e2m19,Kirix_,2,Tue Jul 21 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"A striker and a centre-forward are sometimes but not always the same thing; the main difference arises from the word ""centre"".  Either may be used to refer to any player who plays as the most advanced goalscoring threat OR any player in the highest positional strata in the centre position, and a striker may also refer to any player in the wide positions as well, although typically only if they are a frequent goalscoring threat."

reddevils,3e2m19,IBENGM,0,Tue Jul 21 18:46:08 2015 UTC,"At Real Madrid almost all the players are world class, so the service he gets is always quality and since he is a deadly finisher he will bang them in, hence lots of goals. The thing i'm worried about is due to his age he has became more relying on service rather than creating his own chances like he was at united,that's why benitez wants to play him as a striker (if rumours are true).Nway where do you think he would play if he was to come and where would Rooney play?"
reddevils,3e2m19,Orcnick,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:59:34 2015 UTC,"At Real Madrid almost all the players are world class   Well so do we. Also hes way above them.

I think people are far too emotional on this sub when it comes to the squad. There is no harm whatsoever in wanting what's best for the team and saying a player just isn't good enough for United anymore. Remember this is a guy that was brought in from Wigan to replace Cristiano Ronaldo. Having been given the Number 7 shirt, he realised he simply wasn't up for the job and had to hand it back in. His service and deliveries have had no end product. Like him all you want, be a fan of his all you want but there is no questioning he is one of the weaker players in this squad right now."

What is wrong with you cunts? That was a perfectly reasonable comment, and he's 100% correct. People are too emotional. The Falcao bullshit especially got fucking tiresome. There's nothing wrong with criticising players at all, everyone is entitled to an opinion.   Valencia isn't good enough in defence or attack, he's very average.

reddevils,3e2cb7,WRCousCous,-17,Tue Jul 21 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"And that's why we are doing so poorly as a team.  Antonio Valencia represents the lack of ability Manchester United had in the midfield for the last 8 years or so in the Fergie era.  The lad is hard working yes, but he is a Wigan type of player. Hard work is the very least you should expect from a Manchester United player.  Roy Keane, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Andy Cole etc were all hard working players too but they also had very good ability to do their job.  Antonio Valencia can't cross for shit. He can't use his left foot so has to do a whole 180 degree turn to pass which wastes opportunities. He is also dumb as fuck passing wise and has no special defence opening capabilties in his passing reportour.  He is just a very average player who made a career at Manchester United. Even Quinton Fortune was better than this guy.  I laughed the day we signed him as Cristiano Ronaldo's replacement."
reddevils,3e2cb7,TheClassOf92,7,Tue Jul 21 13:48:14 2015 UTC,reportour  ?   Anyway judging by some of your other comments you seem fairly bitter about the team. Can I ask why you bother supporting them if it gets you so wound up?
reddevils,3e2cb7,wharsmetoothpicson,2,Tue Jul 21 14:30:28 2015 UTC,Well would you prefer if he stopped supporting the team when he wasn't happy with the players' performances.

reddevils,3e2cb7,ParkerZA,3,Tue Jul 21 17:05:20 2015 UTC,"I honestly think people like this thread's OP or ohyou123 didn't understand much of United. I don't know why, on the one thread people are appreciating Valencia, feel the need to say ""wow look at Beckham look at Ronaldo and then look at Valencia 10000 goals vs 2 goals"". Sure, Valencia is not the ideal starter, you don't list him in World XIs, but he does a job well enough to belong to the squad. Just like Park Ji-sung, just like Darren Fletcher, Jesper Blomqvist, Daley Blind as well. We can't have Ronaldo and Messi with Muller and Robben on the bench as backup. But we don't need to"
reddevils,3e2cb7,YoungJump,3,Tue Jul 21 17:18:16 2015 UTC,"Exactly. It's great to have a team, but it's more important to have a squad, and that means having players like Valencia that are willing to fill in when needed. It's the rock Fergie built his success on."

In 1968 he won the European Cup with United, and was named the European Footballer of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year. He is described by the Irish Football Association as the ""greatest player to ever pull on the green shirt of Northern Ireland"". Born and brought up in Belfast, Best began his club career in England with Manchester United, with the scout who had spotted his talent at the age of 15 sending a telegram to manager Matt Busby which read: ""I think I've found you a genius."" He went on to see success with United, scoring 179 goals from 470 appearances over 11 years, and was the club's top goalscorer in the league for five consecutive seasons. One of the greatest dribblers of all time, his playing style combined pace, skill, balance, feints, two-footedness, goalscoring and the ability to beat defenders.   read more...  Feedback/Problems?"

reddevils,3e0vyk,OllieWillie,32,Tue Jul 21 03:13:33 2015 UTC,"This is an interesting puzzle.  He mentioned a striker, so it's probably a striker.  It's someone that isn't linked to us.  Someone that would presumably be willing to play second fiddle to Rooney OR will play RW and can also play ST.  That seems likely, we need a RW.    The big question is what level is this player going to be.  Is this new signing going to be a backup of sorts?  Well thats not exciting, why would you even mention that.  He didn't say shit like this before we signed Blind.  Or is this signing going to blow our minds?  That would definitely be worth getting us hyped up over, and this comment makes a little more sense then.  He also didn't mention a player, so if for some reason it doesn't happen we won't have anything to be disappointed about.    I don't know. But I'm excited.  RONALDO'S COMING HOME LADS."

Big marquee signings are great, but this club has always been built around acquiring as yet unfulfilled potential via the academy and scouting and giving them the platform to reach the top, at the club.   Not only that, there isn't really room for a marquee striker if we're only playing 1 up top and Rooney is that man by virtue of the fact he's the Captain. The number 2 spot is perfect for an unpolished diamond."
reddevils,3e0vyk,89raikessj,5,Tue Jul 21 06:01:07 2015 UTC,"We should start a club, cause i feel the exact same way and it seems few else do.  I think sometimes buying a big name player from a big club means that player has won lots of trophies already and the hunger isnt always there."
reddevils,3e0vyk,blacksheeping,19,Tue Jul 21 08:06:00 2015 UTC,Tell me why I shouldn't think it's Bas Dost.
reddevils,3e0vyk,psxv,7,Tue Jul 21 04:27:07 2015 UTC,bcuz Bas Dost didnt even get called up to play at the NT when LVG was the coach there
reddevils,3e0vyk,failingdutchman,4,Tue Jul 21 08:48:53 2015 UTC,In my opinion he's not the kind of striker that would suit our system
reddevils,3e0vyk,tamasuperstar,2,Tue Jul 21 09:03:37 2015 UTC,He's nowhere near good enough anyway.
reddevils,3e0vyk,mink551,9,Tue Jul 21 12:23:35 2015 UTC,Messi? lol i wish
reddevils,3e0vyk,thedreaminggoose,10,Tue Jul 21 03:08:29 2015 UTC,"Why does everyone think its going to be Ronaldo? that ship has sailed, he is fully commit to Madrid. We came closest to this happening a couple of years back but we couldn't make it happen unfortunately.   Ronaldo will probably do a couple more years in Madrid, his performances will drop 5/10% and the fans will start to brick his car - he will then head off to the states to finish his playing days with one last HUGE contract.   Thats what I see happening ;)"

reddevils,3e0vyk,ukfashman,43,Tue Jul 21 06:37:58 2015 UTC,Just throwing this out there but we could sign Hulk. He has publicly stated how he is not happy with the Russian fans. He could be signed for less than 30 million pounds. I would personally love him in a Manchester United jersey.

reddevils,3e0vyk,iNEEDheplreddit,9,Tue Jul 21 05:39:32 2015 UTC,He would fit our system but again I think he cares more about his wages than his prestige.
reddevils,3e0vyk,PigPenBlues,7,Tue Jul 21 06:06:21 2015 UTC,You guys still pay pretty good wages though and it's an offer to play for one of the 4 biggest clubs in the world.
reddevils,3e0vyk,Cyssero,27,Tue Jul 21 07:28:27 2015 UTC,He's so overrated. Scores one bullet every 6 months and he's world class again. Obviously a mercenary too after going to russia for the big bucks. No thanks
reddevils,3e0vyk,tommym109,2,Tue Jul 21 08:17:08 2015 UTC,Hulk didn't go to Russia for big bucks. He went because of third party ownership. And he's not a 'bullet every 6 months' he's been great at Zenit.

reddevils,3e0vyk,ConqueringCanada,6,Tue Jul 21 04:50:22 2015 UTC,Is he implying that it is a striker just not the one everyone is talking about or that it's not a striker?
reddevils,3e0vyk,Rockzilla4000,2,Tue Jul 21 03:34:53 2015 UTC,"I think the former because why else would he refer to the player we're linked with as a striker and not just say ""player"" or something"
reddevils,3e0vyk,littIehobbitses,25,Tue Jul 21 04:07:18 2015 UTC,I'm thinking Pogba. I know it's unrealistic but Patrice could've spent the last year whispering in his ear about having unfinished business at United
reddevils,3e0vyk,fmc_iii,58,Tue Jul 21 03:26:49 2015 UTC,Playing Pogba as a striker would be bold
reddevils,3e0vyk,JGQuintel,23,Tue Jul 21 03:54:10 2015 UTC,I'm not sure lvg means that it will be a striker. I think something was lost in translation. I think he might mean it's not going to be a striker like everyone thinks it will be. Instead it will be another position.
reddevils,3e0vyk,shtzkrieg,2,Tue Jul 21 05:02:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know man, but ""its not the striker that the media has written about"" seems pretty specific."

reddevils,3e0vyk,littIehobbitses,23,Tue Jul 21 03:55:40 2015 UTC,"It's Kevin De Bruyne. Wolfsburg asking price is €60, or about ~42 million pounds. Logging out now before it's announced and people ask me about it lol"

reddevils,3e0vyk,stevozz,5,Tue Jul 21 08:08:07 2015 UTC,"De Bruyne isn't a striker, nor is he a winger. His natural position is as a CAM, I think we have enough of those.  Sure he can play on the wing, he does it for Belgium, but that's not his best position.  We're not buying De Bruyne. Besides, it's looking very likely that he's staying with Wolfsburg another season."
reddevils,3e0vyk,Phyrion01,2,Tue Jul 21 09:12:13 2015 UTC,I would take kev in a hearbeat. I honestly wouldn't mind if the di maria to psg thing went ahead then. We could buy de bruyne with that money and have cash left over too

reddevils,3e0vyk,jammybear,13,Tue Jul 21 03:04:54 2015 UTC,I feel like it might be Pedro and LVG is slightly behind the British papers. It's only been a recent link.

reddevils,3e0vyk,jammybear,13,Tue Jul 21 03:20:09 2015 UTC,Alexandre Pato anyone? Rumours going around that he's heading to the EPL but to a mid-table team. What if we gave him a shot here and tried to get him back on form. Still only 25 as well. Personally I don't think there's much hope for him but he meets the criteria of someone who the media hasn't written about I guess.
reddevils,3e0vyk,Isho,13,Tue Jul 21 02:40:17 2015 UTC,Would certainly be a surprise. I wouldn't really know how to react if it happened.
reddevils,3e0vyk,Shaggadelic1,6,Tue Jul 21 02:43:58 2015 UTC,If it was relatively cheap then I'd be okay with it. He had all the potential in the world and I'd love to see him become a top player again. Taking him on loan with an option to buy at the end of the season would be ideal I reckon.
reddevils,3e0vyk,delqhic,33,Tue Jul 21 02:57:11 2015 UTC,Taking an out of form striker on loan and trying to get him back to his best...let's not make that a habit.
reddevils,3e0vyk,Shaggadelic1,3,Tue Jul 21 03:02:04 2015 UTC,"Pato isn't really out of form right now though, I believe he's scored 16 in 32? Which isn't an awful scoring record. Nowhere near what he could've been at Milan, but I'd like to see us get him close to what he could've been. Would be a lot cheaper than Falcao too."
reddevils,3e0vyk,delqhic,5,Tue Jul 21 03:04:57 2015 UTC,"I know, just thought it was a funny parallel is all. Maybe out of form was the wrong phrase, I couldn't really think of the proper way to phrase it. Regardless, it would be interesting to see how it would pan out if it happened."
reddevils,3e0vyk,Shaggadelic1,4,Tue Jul 21 03:08:26 2015 UTC,I'd have mixed feelings. I really love the guy and the talent is/was there. But it's been so long since I've seen him play or heard of him that I figure he's fallen badly.
reddevils,3e0vyk,Mkorm1k,2,Tue Jul 21 06:47:26 2015 UTC,"I was thinking this, he has the experience and had plenty of potential but sadly I think he's past it despite being 25."

reddevils,3e2bpr,-iusedtobecool,10,Tue Jul 21 13:43:07 2015 UTC,"Huntelaar is great but he's getting on a bit now and hasn't been tested in the premier league.

reddevils,3e2bpr,OldManTrafford,12,Tue Jul 21 14:03:51 2015 UTC,I must have been watching a different Rooney to a lot of people last season (or the past 3 seasons). Rooney hasn't been a world class striker for a while. Hes not suddenly going to score 25+ goals  this season and I'll put money on that. His ball control in close spaces ceases to exist and short passing is non existent. He peaked in the 11-12 season and has been gradually getting worse. Most people on this subreddit won't agree with me and I'll get slaughtered for saying anything against our captain and leader blah blah blah. but we need better to compete with Chelsea and that rabble . Sorry
reddevils,3e2bpr,jbdoodle,12,Tue Jul 21 13:53:09 2015 UTC,"well I think minor injuries, less confidence, and more selfless in front of the box, in the box made the different. As he became more mature, he became more selfless, I think. Also, he's been going down and up as striker and midfield, so it's obvious that he cant score more goals than he did in the seasons when he was only a striker and had great passes from Scholes and Giggs and etc."
reddevils,3e2bpr,TheJoshider10,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:07:35 2015 UTC,"But in 11/12 he was our main creative player, played behind the main striker (Welbeck for most of it) and equalled his goal tally from 09/10 where people say he was one of the best in the world, like top 3 worthy.   Rooney hasn't been a main striker since 10/11 and the change in his game and duties has led to a slower, less aggressive Rooney. 12/13 when he was no longer the main goal source  made him seem like a different player."
reddevils,3e2bpr,MattARC,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:23:30 2015 UTC,"I'd put it down to confidence/trust issues.  Rooney went from top scorer twice in 3 years (09/10 & 11/12), to being relegated to second fiddle to a new signing (RVP 12/13).  It's now become public knowledge that SAF openly told the entire 12/13 squad to ""pass the ball to RVP, because his goals will win us the title!""  Imagine being Rooney in that situation. I'd wager that both his confidence levels & trust in SAF dropped significantly."

When was that said, and also I think before the Real Madrid game he said that Rooney would be sold in the summer or something."
reddevils,3e2bpr,kw9403,2,Tue Jul 21 19:07:21 2015 UTC,I believe he's world class on his day but he's very inconsistent. He's still got that ability like we seen in the Moyes season where he literally dragged us through some of those games himself. I think it'll only be fair to judge after this season when he's played in his own position for the full year unlike every season where poor management of him individually has seen him play loads of different roles. You can't blame a player for being inconsistent really when they're shifted around the pitch so much.
reddevils,3e2bpr,jbdoodle,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:53:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah you are right, being moved about the pitch would effect his goals scored, but Rooney played 14 games as a striker and only scored 4 goals last season according to whoscored. That is fucking dire for a player who is ""world class on his day""."
reddevils,3e2bpr,kw9403,4,Tue Jul 21 16:03:23 2015 UTC,"You cant just bang on about stats bud it makes you sound clueless. Remember these 14 games weren't one after another. That isn't a consistent run and doesn't let a player get into their rhythm. Scoring 4 in 14 doesn't mean he's not world class on his day, don't even know why you attacked that comment but used a completely irrelevant issue to back yourself up"
reddevils,3e2bpr,hardgour,2,Tue Jul 21 16:10:25 2015 UTC,"I tend to disagree. I understand his lack of goals but understandably he has been placed in the midfield and/or bench during the end of SAF, and under DM (the entire team lacked confidence along with a shit midfield). This first year with LVG he only showed promise and lead us along with DDG to a top four finish (playing as the utility player) . He is (after this season) the top goal scorer for club and country. If he gets a majority of games as the CF/ST can see him grabbing 20 goals (at least) this year in the league alone along with double digit assists."
reddevils,3e2bpr,OldManTrafford,-7,Tue Jul 21 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. Can't fault his work rate, but he's never been world class. He is a great player and fantastic to have in the team but to suggest he can be mentioned in the same breath as players like Ronaldo, Messi, Aguero, Ibra etc is moronic."
reddevils,3e2bpr,frankowen18,15,Tue Jul 21 14:08:15 2015 UTC,"You're the moron if you think he's never been world class.    He's about to become the record scorer for Manchester United and England. He consistently gets double figures every season despite being asked to play in a variety of positions. He pretty much carried us in Moyes' season and was key from the moment he signed for SAF, playing a huge part in every single trophy. He's lost some of the explosive pace of his 20's, but he's still a great finisher, aggressive and the talisman of the team. He contributes loads.   ''Never been world class'', seriously get fucked. You can't tell me you're a United fan and hold that opinion. I'm convinced it's Americans in this sub that constantly try and belittle and shit on Rooney, when he's gone you'll all be pining for him back.   For what it's worth, I think he'll bang in the goals next season if played as our main striker. I hope he scores 20 in the league just so some people here can shut the fuck up."

He said 'it's moronic' to think Rooney is comparable to Ibrahimovic (who's career pales in comparison to Rooneys, by the way), I said I thought the opposite is moronic.   And people can get fucked. I'm so sick of reading about people shitting on Rooney in this sub, sick of it. He's one of our best and most important players, you've got to be delusional or just a total idiot not to see that.   ''Hurr durr sign one season wonder Lacazette'' will get hundreds of upvotes, whilst the world class striker we've had for a decade is constantly shit on without a second thought. Tired of it. People can get fucked.   Like I said, I think it's Americans who prefer a shiny haircut and a marketable face over a genuinely class footballer. Sorry, that's what i've observed. It's always the clueless yanks. I've had many a discussion about Rooney with fans of every club, and they unanimously hate him because of the great player he is. It's only the worst type of entitled dickhead on /r/reddevils that doesn't rate him."

I've played and watched and studied loads of the game but since I live in a different country that you obviously don't like then we are all knuckle dragging morons to you.

It's nice to hear an American fan agree he is world class."
reddevils,3e2bpr,hardgour,2,Tue Jul 21 16:00:08 2015 UTC,"As an American, I understand ur point of Americans wanting shiny new things, but to say a majority of us do not like Rooney or want to replace him is wild. He is ""in my mind"" the greatest English player on the planet, and is a constant for club and country. He is a world class footballer and would walk into any teams XI on the planet.   It's outrageous the amount of flack Rooney gets every day from fans. He was 18 when he moved to United and has since developed from raw talent to world class footballer. He is the best player we have on our team."
reddevils,3e2bpr,jbdoodle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:37:14 2015 UTC,"You are right Rooney was world class but not anymore, far from it. But a lot of Mancunian fans fucking despise Rooney for what he did to Utd. He bent the club over a barrel...... twice! (By the way I ain't American)"
reddevils,3e2bpr,frankowen18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:09:46 2015 UTC,"I know, but i've long held that's misguided anger. Everything that we've learnt since SAF retired supports Rooney. As fans of the club we were very frustrated with the spending policy at the time and Fergies transfer decisions; Rooney also questioned them as a paid professional. I don't think he did much wrong other than complain Man Utd should be acting like Man Utd."
reddevils,3e2bpr,jbdoodle,2,Tue Jul 21 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"Do you really think Rooney only had Utds best interests at heart when he refused to sign a contract the first time or when him and Paul Stretford (ironic last name) made a big deal about wanting to leave the second time. He conveniently got massive wage hikes in both cases and also made himself look like a massive cunt to many, me included."
reddevils,3e2bpr,frankowen18,2,Tue Jul 21 16:27:30 2015 UTC,"No, I think he had his own as well. I think he didn't want to waste his prime years playing for a club that might have been on the slide, and I think that's fair enough. Man Utd were not acting like the club we know at that time. He questioned our strategy at that time, and was given assurances (including more money) that made him stay eventually. I don't think he did a whole lot wrong."

reddevils,3e2bpr,MorningFresh123,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:35:27 2015 UTC,I think they consorted to play for the best possible contract he could get. The club would do the same if they decided they wanted to sell him. It's called due diligence.
reddevils,3e2bpr,LordConnor,3,Tue Jul 21 17:43:13 2015 UTC,Charlie Austin would be a great buy imo. Even said that a month or two ago when the Benzema rumors were running rampant

reddevils,3e2bpr,dmindlin824,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:17:02 2015 UTC,I still disagree. We don't need someone like Lewandowski or Cavani who will have massive wages and will cost a ton of money. We'd have to bench one of them or Rooney and that is simply not needed. Someone like Austin would be fine.
reddevils,3e2bpr,Kambei1311,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:41:17 2015 UTC,"So we are signing another striker AND LvG has long term plans for Chicarito? As well as talking about using Memphis and Januzaj as strikers? Adding Wilson on top of that, it surely seems like a striker surplus. I guess if LvG doesnt really think Chica is staying and doesnt trust the youth to be second choice if wazza gets injured, it would make some sense to get a new backup striker, but i dont think there is anyone who would start over Rooney that's available. Unless based Woodward can MAKE them available i guess... :)"
reddevils,3e2bpr,slaystation25,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:42 2015 UTC,"I agree that a rotation striker may be all that is needed next season with Rooney taking a permanent central role. The only thing that makes me think we could be looking at a marquee signing is the selling of Van Persie, who would've been perfect as a rotation striker to chip in here and there when Rooney is injured or needs a rest. It seems odd we would sell someone with proven premier league quality just to buy someone as a rotation who doesn't have his experience. Maybe a big name signing is still on the cards?"
reddevils,3e2bpr,maniacaldentist,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:08 2015 UTC,I'm fully on-board with letting Wazza take the lone-striker role this season. It's been awhile since he's had the opportunity for a full season without having to fill-in elsewhere.

reddevils,3e1qt6,reddit_no_likey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:42 2015 UTC,Mata played his best football in red in that Messi position last year. He's not strong enough to be a #10 in LVG's system. Bullied off the ball. Same reason why Coutinho won't go to an actual top club.
reddevils,3e1qt6,googly__moogly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:35:03 2015 UTC,Not really that stacked. Not many of those are class players at the moment that would start on top teams. Di María is probably leaving which leaves Pedro as the only class full time winger there. Even if he stays we don’t know how good Di María will perform after last season.
reddevils,3e1qt6,King-Eric,29,Tue Jul 21 08:52:48 2015 UTC,"/r/reddevils doesn't take too kindly to anything even mildly negative (or realistic).   Young: A good pro to have in the squad and he deserves a lot of credit for remaining at United. But he's hardly a world-beater. Valencia: Not the player he was before the injury and is a right-back now any way. Mata: Very good player and has a great goal ratio. But he's below the very best. Depay: Lots of potential but we have no idea how he'll adapt to England. Januzaj: Again lots of potential but needs to show he can stand up to being targeted. Once he lost his initial surprise impact, he hasn't been the same. Needs to show he can adapt and become a genuine top level player.  Di Maria: Top class but those four months at Real Madrid are an outlier to his normal level. Inconsistent and needs to show he can actually adapt to English football. I don't think he'll be at United for much longer.  Pedro: A good player.    All in all it is a good selection and capable of winning trophies. But I think people are unfairly hammering /u/King-Eric just because he is criticising United. That habit is a scourge on this subreddit."

Pedro has been great for Barcelona and has only taken a back seat recently due to Neymar being on the team. PSG have been after both Depay and Januzaj (and I would consider PSG a top team). Mata was great for us last season. OK Young and Valencia might not walk into a top team however all top teams need a few decent rotation players for the long season.

He was superb at the start when he joined us. After that it was all downhill. He didn't perform like a class player for most of the season and there's no telling if he can regain the form that led him to costing a record fee. The idea of Angel playing on the wing is a lot better than the actual reality. The reality is he didn't play well last season and hope is blinding a lot of people. I get why it does but people need to look more at the actual reality. This doesn't even get into the fact that in all likelihood he's probably on his way out.    Pedro has been great for Barcelona and has only taken a back seat recently due to Neymar being on the team.   I said he was class..? I didn't say he wasn't, I said the opposite.   PSG have been after both Depay and Januzaj (and I would consider PSG a top team).    That doesn't automatically make them class right now. Just because Odegaard was wanted by all of Europe does that mean he's a class player right now? No. They were sought after because of what they could potentially become, not what they are right now. They could be class in the future and I hope they are, but they're not right now.    Mata was great for us last season.    Yeah all across the attack, not in one particular role. He could probably do the job there but he shouldn't be starting on the wing all the time. He makes decent cover for that position I suppose but his main position where he thrives is playing behind strikers.

I think that's looking into the stats too much. It was clearly apparent that aside from a few world class games, he wasn't that great. A player at that price shouldn't be benched for months on end. People forget how terrible he played at times. Even accounting for van Gaal bringing the best out in Young, he still shouldn't be keeping Di María out of the team.    Exactly they have the potential to be class and lets not forget Memphis was top goalscorer in the Erdevise last season.   We're talking about right now though. They could be class later on, but they're not right now. What they could be later on doesn't mean much when we're talking about how stacked the team is right now.    Still looks stacked to me especially if you include Perreira and Lingard to the mix   It's compiled with good players, not many great.If Di María leaves Pedro would be the only class winger there, with some having the potential to become some.

They could be class later on, but they're not right now. What they could be later on doesn't mean much when we're talking about how stacked the team is right now.   A team is not just for one season but should be around for a long time. We need to blood the young prospects before they take on a major role in the team. This was our issue in relation to Smalling and Jones, good prospects but did not get enough game time because of Vidic and Rio. they will get a lot of game time in the cups more than likely therefor they can be considered as part of our ""stacking""  We must have a different definition of stacked as if you look at our main competition i.e. Chelsea, City and Arsenal you can see they have 2 very good wingers and a number of not so good ones as back up. we are on the same level as these other clubs"

reddevils,3e1qt6,as520,2,Tue Jul 21 09:10:40 2015 UTC,It depends on the tactics you play. Mata is very effective on the wing when we want him to focus on lateral movement vs. the traditional up and down the wing movement. He allows for us to have a little versatility that is difficult to account for.

Moscow, 2008, utterly destroyed a makeshift right back in Michael Essien. Countless other examples of wing play, 07-08 especially he formed a fluid partnership with Evra. He was still more than able to exert his influence from the wing, often running into central positions to wreak havoc."
reddevils,3e1j46,TheFormidableGiant,4,Tue Jul 21 08:20:17 2015 UTC,"He was pretty much striker in european games, since he didnt track back."
reddevils,3e1j46,Zvcx,-3,Tue Jul 21 10:57:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, he played something similar in his last two seasons (or three and he went back on the wing in his last season because Fergie wanted to teach the team live without him)"
reddevils,3e1j46,kiwwi191,3,Tue Jul 21 07:57:15 2015 UTC,"Barely, I watched almost every game and he definitely didn't play more than 5-10 as a striker at utd. The 2nd Champions league final he played he did, but that was a tactical disaster. It didn't suit us at that time."
reddevils,3e1j46,wallpaper_01,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:47:55 2015 UTC,"I think you could argue briefly with Ole and even Giggsy if you count when he was used in the 10 role towards the end of his career. If we are counting full season partnerships then I'd probably take out Falcao and Welbeck, but it's a cool infographic and a testament to how long he's been in the team. It would be cool to see something like this for other positions."

reddevils,3e1j46,Simpilicious,-1,Tue Jul 21 17:55:29 2015 UTC,If Ronnie is in there then Nani should be as well. Considering  the 09/10 season where he hit top form and was playing almost as a second striker.

reddevils,3e2ixv,aman27deep,-9,Tue Jul 21 17:05:33 2015 UTC,I would buy the book if it was really written by him and was a genuine account of his time at Manchester United.  Too often these autobiographies are full of exaggerated bull and made up quotes by ghostwriters to sell the book rather than tell the actual accounts.  Buy Sir Alex Ferguson's books from <1995 and you'll see some genuine stuff from his experiences and thoughts. Go look it up on Amazon.

reddevils,3e26hl,peduxe,14,Tue Jul 21 11:34:11 2015 UTC,Didn't Van Gaal say the signing is someone the press hasn't talked about?
reddevils,3e26hl,Oli_Row,13,Tue Jul 21 11:36:18 2015 UTC,Yeah but he probably hadn't seen the internet reports. I doubt he'd seen any physical papers reporting it by the time he made that comment.
reddevils,3e26hl,glintings,16,Tue Jul 21 11:42:10 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. People going on that if there's been any sniff of any name, it can't be him. van Gaal refers to the 'media', but means like a handful of reporters. He won't see internet reports, he'll read a few newspapers. It could very well be Pedro...So many people thinking we're going for someone completely off the radar. (We might be, but I think people are looking too deep into LVG's comments)"
reddevils,3e26hl,D1794,6,Tue Jul 21 11:48:20 2015 UTC,"But with Pedro Ed told all of the United journalists about Pedro at his private press interview, hence why they all released stories after the embargo. If ed is telling them then LVG must know.  I dont see Pedro as a solution to our strikers anyway, I know he can play as a striker but his best position isnt in the middle in a 4-3-3 its on the right, I see him fighting for Matas place and/or a direct replacement for Di Maria to keep in with the ""we have 2 players in each position that can fight for a place"" comment.  All the top tiers in the 4-3-3 articles used the sentence ""Will only buy a striker that improves on Wanye Rooney"" and then the surprise striker statement came out. To me that must mean the suprise player (if there is one, Im personally in the boat that hes winding the press up) must be a top out and out striker."
reddevils,3e26hl,Creamy_Goodne55,3,Tue Jul 21 11:54:08 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think we need anyone top tier. With Rooney, Hernandez and Wilson, supported by Memphis, Januzaj, Pereira, Young, maybe ADM, I think we're good."
reddevils,3e26hl,D1794,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:57:21 2015 UTC,I agree in theory but If we can improve our strike force (say bring in a top striker and let Wilson go on loan all season because of it) then it will be the difference we need to challenge for a title imo.
reddevils,3e26hl,Creamy_Goodne55,2,Tue Jul 21 12:10:13 2015 UTC,But the Pedro news was apparantly leaked by Utd so he would know it's out there.
reddevils,3e26hl,mink_man,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:54:36 2015 UTC,Right! And when Pedro did start hitting the twittersphere it WAS completely off the radar. I'd be pretty surprised if it wasn't Pedro.   It makes so much sense. Great value. Champions League pedigree. Works really well in a possession based system. Would be happy with a squad-roation role across all the forward positions with Rooney/di Maria/Mata/Depay. Proven goalscorer. Did I say great value? He's a 30m player easily
reddevils,3e26hl,glintings,2,Tue Jul 21 11:51:00 2015 UTC,Pretty sure he meant not the 100m bid for Muller

He scores a lot for Barca, quite a good goal ratio for a winger, he too happens to be always in the right place to put the ball in the net, he's probably the only capable and available winger for this role and will fit well here."

Now they're crying FFP.....lol  People are just so used to the Glaziers being so conservative with their wallets - United suffered from underinvestment for the best part of a decade.

reddevils,3e23f1,slaystation25,4,Tue Jul 21 10:56:22 2015 UTC,"Two sides to this. Either we aren't in for him (as reported by Times etc) or Valencia is trying to drum up interest to get more out of us. The things being said now about City are the exact same things which were reported a week or so ago. Lopez going for a meeting, Mendes waiting for an agreement etc etc"
reddevils,3e23f1,hambodpm,14,Tue Jul 21 11:02:36 2015 UTC,"Considering that apparently we were never actually in for him, not overly concerned. Let's just hope he is another Mangala."

Also, Mangala was very highly rated before City got him, including CL performances. Let's not forget that La Liga and Copa America are not the PL... Look at ADM."
reddevils,3e23f1,StannisJr,3,Tue Jul 21 10:56:33 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't write off a player one season in the PL tbh. PL is obviously different and players need to adjust. Mangala played better at the latter end of the season tbf, and a poor Di Maria racked up 10 assists and 3 goals iirc."

Granted Mangala improved as he adjusted, however at £38,000,000 I think it's safe to say that he can still be considered a flop regardless of his minor improvement.    As for ADM, if he stays I do think he will turn it around and show his class. However stats can never tell the whole story, how many of those goals and assists came before the break in? Also at times he just looked disinterested and going through the motions, there are no stats for that."
reddevils,3e23f1,WillyMorganOnTheWing,3,Tue Jul 21 11:06:31 2015 UTC,I wouldn't write off a player one season in the PL tbh.   Likewise I wouldn't write home about somebody based on one season in La Liga.
reddevils,3e23f1,StannisJr,3,Tue Jul 21 11:49:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but he was probably the best CB in La Liga last season, and if he was to drop drastically in form then I'd be surprised. There are no better CB's available that I can think of, I'd rather take the risk than let City get him, and he turns out to be an amazing CB."

Considering he was in team of la liga, and team of copa america, I really wouldn't want to miss out on him. He might not do well, or he might be the CB that could help us reclaim the title.  If he went to City and kept that form, and became a world class CB, I'd feel awful that we missed out on that. It's well worth taking the risk imo."

reddevils,3e23f1,ReflectingGod,0,Tue Jul 21 13:20:34 2015 UTC,"If we could only get one, I'd much rather we have Ramos but if it means Otamendi going to City, I'd make him our top priority. However, City spent £32m on Mangala and despite having a shaky first season he is still a solid defender and as willing as City are to splash the cash, I don't think they will be looking to replace so soon. Many put down City's defensive issues down the the constantly chaning backline last season.  How would getting Otamendi and Ramos sound? Can you imagine a backline of Darmian, Ramos, Otamendi and Shaw with Schneiderlin and Bastian in front? My only problem would be the fact we'd have 3 good defenders as backup who arguably deserve a first team spot. Admittedly I'm not Jones' biggest fan. I've never seen much in him and last season he wasn't much better than Evans. At 23 he isn't good enough to be a starter IMO ahead of Rojo and Smalling let alone Otamendi and Ramos. This will only further harm his development so if we were to sign both, even just one, I'm not sure what the future would hold for Jones.  Would anyone be up for loaning Paddy next season?"

The problem is that next season we'll have plenty of defenders ahead of him and if we don't happen to have a ridicules amount of injuries again, he is only going to get half the gametime he got last season which i don't think was enough for him to begin with. he is 20 now and I think sending him on loan could do him good."
reddevils,3e23f1,StannisJr,2,Tue Jul 21 11:08:27 2015 UTC,"I guess you're right. That was a freak injury crisis I suppose, but our defenders are pretty injury prone. The only reason I had to keep him was in the case of an injury crisis, but I guess he could be recalled."

reddevils,3dzu1w,FrankHughesy,58,Mon Jul 20 21:33:23 2015 UTC,"Wayne Rooney has challenged himself to score the goals that will deliver the Premier League title for Manchester United this season after insisting that his days as the team’s hole-filler were over.  It sums up the paradox of Rooney’s recent United career that it has taken the signings of two defensive midfielders to restore him to the front and centre of Louis van Gaal’s plans at Old Trafford.  With Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin giving United experience, strength and quality at the heart of the team, Rooney has been given a defined role further forward by Van Gaal, who sees his captain as the tip of a 4-3-3 formation, a striker in the same bracket as the likes of Diego Costa and Sergio Agüero.  Despite posting his lowest goal return for United last season since arriving from Everton as a teenager in 2004, Rooney will shoulder the goalscoring burden in the forthcoming campaign and the 29‑year-old insists that, after plugging gaps in midfield for too long, he can prove he remains one of the game’s most potent strikers.  “My best position, and I have always said it, is as a striker, getting into the box,” Rooney said. “And the two seasons I have really done that as a lone striker have been my two best goalscoring seasons. It is where the manager and myself see my best position. Hopefully I can get a good run of games and repay the manager and score goals for the team, but it [pressure] is obviously on me to do that. I have no doubts that I can score 20 goals or more again and I am ready to take on that mantle and be the one who gets the goals for this team. If I play up there again this season, then I can get the goals. It is where I like and it is where I will play.”  As he claims, Rooney’s most prolific campaigns for United have been when he occupied the ‘No 9’ centre-forward role for the team. In 2009-10 he scored 34 goals in all competitions, having been asked to fill the goalscoring hole left by the departed Cristiano Ronaldo, then in 2011-12 he hit the same number. In his nine other seasons in a United shirt, Rooney has failed to break the 20-league goal barrier, with Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes and Van Gaal all, at times, using the England captain in a variety of deeper-lying positions.  While Rooney, who is 20 goals short of breaking Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time United record of 249, insists he has always accepted the need to sacrifice himself for the team, he believes the numbers point to where he is most valuable for club and country. “I have played different roles over the years for United, but you only have to look when I play for England as a striker, I score goals,” Rooney said.  “I hope to score 20 or more goals again this season. If I am playing as a striker, I will be disappointed if I cannot that do that. The last time I really played the full season as a striker was 2011-12. All the other seasons, I have been up front, then in midfield or out wide, so hopefully if I will stay up front. But I don’t think I have sacrificed myself too much over the years.  “Football is a team game and you win and lose together. Over the years, I have been successful and won a lot of trophies with United and I think there are times when you have to do things for the good of the team and I feel I have done that. I have played deeper or wider some seasons and won Premier League medals and, as a footballer, that is your aim – to be successful with your team-mates.  “If the manager wants me to do different jobs I will do it and it was the same last season. But with the quality we have brought into the squad and the numbers we have brought in, the manager has options in midfield, so there shouldn’t be a need to play there.”  After two seasons without a trophy following Ferguson’s retirement, the pressure is on Van Gaal to restore United to winning ways following a 12-month spending spree which now stands a fraction short of £300 million. Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin have bolstered midfield, Memphis Depay has added pace and a goal threat up front, while Italy defender Matteo Darmian has been signed to solve United’s right-back problems.  All four signings showed glimpses of their quality in United’s pre-season tour win against Club America in Seattle at the weekend and Rooney believes Van Gaal’s new-look squad are capable of challenging for the title.  “Obviously with the four new players coming in, there is a lot of excitement within the squad. They are four very good signings and four quality players. They have been training well and the first run out in Seattle will have helped them. Bastian’s arrival is good for the whole team. He is a quality player and a very successful one.  “He is a clever player, calm on the ball, and I am sure he will be a big player for us this season and help us be successful.  “Can we challenge for the title? Yes, I think so. At times last season, we were very good in some of the big games and that added quality will help us be a bit more consistent and it will give us a real chance at the title.”  United face San Jose Earthquakes in California on Tuesday before facing sterner challenges against Barcelona and Paris St‑Germain in San Francisco and Chicago respectively. However, Rooney insisted that every minute of preparation in the United States was focused on hitting the ground running when the season started. “Tottenham is the game we are all preparing for. We have to get off to a good start and get some momentum.”"

reddevils,3dzu1w,BHButcher,68,Mon Jul 20 21:33:54 2015 UTC,"If he's given the chances, he most definitely will score 20-25 goals. I don't care what anyone has to say, he's world class. This ""jack of all trades, master of none"" is bullshit. He is a master of being a forward. What sucked for him was that he was also good at playing other positions while our other strikers (who were also great) were not so to try and fit them all in, Rooney was moved. Now he's finally going to go into a season as a striker for the first time in a long time.   Barring injuries and/or a position change for him, I'll buy the first 5 people to reply to this comment gold if he scores less than 20 goals.

reddevils,3dzu1w,doctorpwn,49,Tue Jul 21 01:59:17 2015 UTC,"Of course he can. He scored 14 with maybe a third of his games at striker, with a weak and constantly shifting midfield behind him."
reddevils,3dzu1w,King-Pele,11,Mon Jul 20 22:37:13 2015 UTC,"Actually, he played 14 out of his 33 league games this year as a striker and scored 12 goals, but you got to remember that in 2011-12 he also wasn't a striker every game and still scored 27 league goals. So maybe the reason for fewer goals is because he's declining not because of the position he's playing."
reddevils,3dzu1w,cylonseverywhere,14,Tue Jul 21 00:50:04 2015 UTC,14 games as a striker scoring 12 goals is brilliant.
reddevils,3dzu1w,kiac,9,Tue Jul 21 04:08:44 2015 UTC,"He didn't score all his goals from striker though, scored a few while playing in midfield.   Postion, apps, goals, assists  MC (Midfielder - Centre) 14, 3, 1  FW (Forward - Centre) 14, 4, 3  AMC (Attacking Midfielder - Centre) 4, 4, 1  FWL (Forward - Left) 1, 1, 0   http://www.whoscored.com/Players/3859"
reddevils,3dzu1w,mink_man,2,Tue Jul 21 06:01:13 2015 UTC,Scholes/Lampard/Gerrard all scored many goals from midfield. It's not like he was playing DM. He did against Chelsea but that was one game. Playing midfield doesn't mean you can't score goals.

reddevils,3dzu1w,Worst_smurf_NA,10,Mon Jul 20 22:14:01 2015 UTC,"Now that we have a proper set of midfielders, no reason Wayne shouldn't score 20+ playing as the lone striker or part of a 2-man tandem up front  I can't wait until Rooney and Memphis develop some chemistry up top. Oh boy, that's gonna be hot"
reddevils,3dzu1w,JimmyDuckShoes,33,Tue Jul 21 00:36:44 2015 UTC,"I think Rooney will have his best goal scoring season ever. Expect at least 30 league goals from him this season, and he will lead England on to win the Euro's in 2016...  Mark my words!"

reddevils,3dzu1w,Kiddcohen39,2,Tue Jul 21 07:02:58 2015 UTC,"To be completely realistic, I think the days of Rooney scoring 20+ are done. I might be a bit pessimistic and I don't need to here his scoring record when he played at striker last year but he just doesn't look the part to me at this point in his career. Don't get me wrong though, I absolutely love Rooney and think he'll be a great player to have as our striker, captain and club talisman. I just think something like 12-15 goals and another 8-12 assists with a constant high work rate is a season we should be pleased with from Rooney this year."
reddevils,3dzu1w,as520,12,Mon Jul 20 21:38:26 2015 UTC,"A bit pessimistic, I believe, he's had 12 in a not so good season where he's been played out of position, in a team riddled with injuries, formation changes etc. I reckon he might hit 20 minimum in PL if he's being played as a striker throughout bar injuries etc. whatnot."
reddevils,3dzu1w,Syri0Forel,9,Mon Jul 20 21:48:22 2015 UTC,"Plus, just compare his midfield support now to last year. Hell, last year Rooney WAS midfield support."
reddevils,3dzu1w,daniam1,11,Mon Jul 20 22:10:01 2015 UTC,He was basically trying to play through balls in to himself from midfield.
reddevils,3dzu1w,sglandsberg,12,Mon Jul 20 22:18:10 2015 UTC,and tbh it kinda worked at times
reddevils,3dzu1w,MullerReus,5,Mon Jul 20 22:57:47 2015 UTC,He scored 19 and assisted 17 in Moyes time. I'm sure he'll do better this season
reddevils,3dzu1w,JTRut,3,Mon Jul 20 23:11:24 2015 UTC,"It's not coincidence that his only years above 20 were the only years he was a striker all year. Put aguero in mid for half a season and see how many goals he scores, my guess is less than 26. I'm expecting lots of goals from wazza"
reddevils,3dzu1w,EddieMcDowall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:50:49 2015 UTC,I think he's setting his sights a little low he is one of the best strikers there is. If he is always used as the sole striker then barring injuries he should be aiming (and expecting) to score 30.
reddevils,3dzu1w,ireallyamsomething,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:10:20 2015 UTC,"I really hope he does score lots of goals and I think he does still have the ability to not only score >20 but also to contribute more to the team than just the goals.   What I am still worried about though are the tactics and the level of service from the midfield. Even with Mata, Herrera, Di Maria last season our strikers didn't get great amount of support from them. Hopefully that'll change for the better this season."

reddevils,3dzu1w,AnonBarksdale,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:47:55 2015 UTC,Rooney better start getting into the damn box if he wants to get the goals. He says his best position is in the box yet he's been dropping deep out of position for YEARS. He hasn't been a true striker that gets on the end of crosses since about 09'/10'.
reddevils,3dzu1w,udaman90,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:27 2015 UTC,How Rooney acts like he is one of the best in the world - and commands wages reflecting that - and still thinks only 20 goals a season is good enough is beyond me... He's basically setting the bar at Charlie Austin
reddevils,3dzu1w,TheDrySkinOnYourKnee,0,Tue Jul 21 08:41:25 2015 UTC,I just don't see where the chances are going to come from. Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger are great signings but they are hardly going to help with our biggest issue: creating goal scoring opportunities against park-the-bus teams. Memphis can help but I get the feeling that he's best in a counter-attacking system.
reddevils,3dzu1w,jackthereddevil,6,Mon Jul 20 23:26:09 2015 UTC,What about Mata? He can create chances. Depay and DiMaria (if he stays) creating on the wings Rooney will get his goals. Really looking forward to the season. Still need a cb but the squad is coming together
reddevils,3dzu1w,Trickybuz93,-1,Tue Jul 21 01:14:37 2015 UTC,I'll believe once he actually does it.
reddevils,3e0ygn,delqhic,41,Tue Jul 21 02:54:53 2015 UTC,Looked solid in his 45 and remained composed when he had to. Excited to see him get a full 90

reddevils,3e0ygn,hdee804,25,Tue Jul 21 03:31:46 2015 UTC,Reckon Fellaini would be a decent keeper.

reddevils,3e0ygn,hdee804,7,Tue Jul 21 04:37:43 2015 UTC,I think he is giving Johnstone an audition for the No 2 spot.
reddevils,3e0ygn,spoofex,5,Tue Jul 21 04:28:18 2015 UTC,"Would love that, rather signing Romero as the backup keeper. Signing Romero would mean shoving Johnstone back to the 4th choice (or perhaps 3rd if Lindegaard goes)."

reddevils,3e368z,Creamy_Goodne55,-2,Tue Jul 21 16:41:34 2015 UTC,"if Real want DDG this season, then they'll have to let Ramos leave. I'm still very very skeptical about all this. I wouldn't be shocked to see Ramos commit to RM.   Which is why I don't understand the Otamendi saga.

New reports say that City are willing to meet the release clause for Otamendi, I'd hate to see him go there."
reddevils,3e368z,RiemsMUFC,8,Tue Jul 21 16:39:57 2015 UTC,"Blind first choice CB? What have I missed, no way he jumps over Smalling, Jones, Rojo, McNair, and Blackett."

I want to play always with a left-footed central defender and Blind can do the job. Maybe he shall play there but all the players can play there. Last year it was Jones and Smalling, and even McNair has played there. But my preference is a left-footed defender and with Rojo and Blind we have two.""   Deep down, it is just a preference for him. It's entirely possible he starts Ramos (if he signs) next to Smalling. It's what I would want to see, that's for sure."

reddevils,3e1lel,theatreofdreams21,0,Tue Jul 21 07:24:17 2015 UTC,That's not a terrible shout. Has his transfer to Real been finalised though?
reddevils,3e1lel,PhilJonesIsTheGOAT,6,Tue Jul 21 10:06:39 2015 UTC,"Griezmann would be my first choice as he'd not only make fantastic backup for Rooney but would significantly improve our first team. Imagine a front 3 (assuming Di Maria goes) of Pedro/Depay - Rooney - Griezmann. Depay shouldn't be a guarenteed starter just yet so I still think it makes sense to buy Pedro who would also double up as a second striker. We'd arguably have a little too much depth with the youngsters so maybe its a good idea to get a couple of them on loan because they won't be getting significant gametime at United.  I'd take Felipe Anderson also. He isn't so much of an out and out striker, more a winger but similar to Pedro, he has all the attributes to make good backup. He scored a goal for every 3 games for Lazio last season and looked really good. He is still really young and very versatile so can be deployed in several positions. Similar to Depay, he may not be a guarenteed starter now but in a few years time we could be talking about one of the best in the world."
reddevils,3e1lel,ReflectingGod,2,Tue Jul 21 09:37:10 2015 UTC,You're getting way too carried away mate. We're not bringing in another winger or two and a striker.

reddevils,3e1lel,ChickenAllDayEvryDay,5,Tue Jul 21 15:31:55 2015 UTC,"Can I ask why Kane is so high up your list?  He had a fantastic first season, obviously. But so many players have had one great first season and fallen in the next. Do you not think he should prove that he can do it consistently before a in shells out the insane money that would be asked for him? It just seems crazy to me that Kane is suddenly a sought after player by the biggest in in the world."
reddevils,3e1lel,Irishane,2,Tue Jul 21 07:28:12 2015 UTC,"Kane as an apprentice to Rooney, takes over the mantle when he retires or leaves. Something about that partnership seems like magic to me. I doubt it'll happen though, Levy's a nightmare to bargain with. I dunno, maybe i'm old fashioned, but I do like an old school English striker."

reddevils,3e1lel,penny_whistle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:40:56 2015 UTC,"Rio had been consistently performing for Leeds at the time and Rooney had a ridiculous level of ability for a kid his age. And he'd been progressing for 2.5 seasons already.   Kane, to my mind, doesn't have the same level of ability or variety about his game. I wouldn't be surprised if come the start of this season he's ""figured out"" and goes through s bit of a rough time. If that doesn't happen, then yes; he's probably good enough.   Hell, Charlie Austin has more pedigree than Kane but he's ""not good enough"" by many fans' estimations."

But look at Bale for example. Was a kid from southampton youth was pretty decent already. Was recognized after scoring against Real in the champions league was it? He had some good game I cant remember. All went quite, was okay, scored a few goals, got a good assist. Then has a dream season for spurs, gets signed to Real Madrid for over 100 million euros."

Note that the number will go up with the addition of Champions League and I think there should be someone to cover Rooney in attack. Chicharito is a backup striker and I think he can cover the England striker. Still he may not be trusted by LVG due to the uncertainty of his form.  Also I didn't expect a big name arrival as a backup to Rooney since players like Benzema, Lewandowski need assurance of first team chance.  So Berahino and Icardi are the possibilities from this list."

reddevils,3e1gmd,Riverknight,50,Tue Jul 21 05:48:26 2015 UTC,"He said last week they must fight for RB. We can chalk this comment up to bad English, I'd say."
reddevils,3e1gmd,welbzy,6,Tue Jul 21 06:50:27 2015 UTC,I agree. He said that he has two players for each position. Maybe he meant Darmian was the second player for the right back position - not that he'll play second fiddle to Tony.
reddevils,3e1gmd,Paskner,80,Tue Jul 21 13:46:15 2015 UTC,"Well, he's not gonna say: ""Valencia is not good enough to be a starter for this club, that's why I have bought Darmian"".  Whoever plays better will start, I think we've seen that by now."
reddevils,3e1gmd,DelusionalThomas666,15,Tue Jul 21 06:02:06 2015 UTC,"I think this is very much down to context and not meant as an individual statement. In the press conference he first talks about the squad imbalance in LvGs first season with the team, and how he didn't have two adequate options for RB (If I recall correct he did not mention Rafael at all).   So in context it seems like ""second position"" just refers to vital coverage of a starting spot and not a literal pecking order."
reddevils,3e1gmd,ninjapanda_,4,Tue Jul 21 09:28:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah LVG's English is weird, sometimes I think he implies things without meaning to"
reddevils,3e1gmd,addodd,2,Tue Jul 21 13:10:20 2015 UTC,Yeah definitively. He is like a journalists dream as a lot of his statements are depended on context and sounds sensational purely on its own legs.
reddevils,3e1gmd,ninjapanda_,27,Tue Jul 21 13:21:27 2015 UTC,He'll soon find Darmian to be the better option tbh.
reddevils,3e1gmd,s_D088z,-8,Tue Jul 21 05:58:38 2015 UTC,well simply cause Valencia is more attacking minded. But i still like Tony as a second choice.
reddevils,3e1gmd,TY1901,19,Tue Jul 21 06:50:05 2015 UTC,Valencia might be more attacking minded but that doesn't really help much when he's not a great attacker.
reddevils,3e1gmd,omegaxLoL,7,Tue Jul 21 09:16:08 2015 UTC,"Darmien is better defensively and offensively than Valencia.  Unless he really, really doesn't take to the league I'd expect him to start."
reddevils,3e1gmd,JuanRiquelme,27,Tue Jul 21 11:27:33 2015 UTC,Valencia is a shit attacker though
reddevils,3e1gmd,owis,5,Tue Jul 21 08:05:18 2015 UTC,He had that one season where him and Rooney were ridiculously in-sync that still seems to carry a lot of weight in people's memories.
reddevils,3e1gmd,d0mth0ma5,-2,Tue Jul 21 12:06:57 2015 UTC,"You know, I often heard one of the strong selling points for Darmian was that he was good at going forward. Well, so was Valencia. At the end of the day, shouldn't the RB be chosen because they are a better defender primarily over being an attacker?"
reddevils,3e1gmd,greatGoD67,9,Tue Jul 21 07:23:04 2015 UTC,Darmian is more conservative in his playing style. He follows instructions and focuses on defense first. That's what I could gather from different quotes and articles about him.
reddevils,3e1gmd,Machr,3,Tue Jul 21 08:30:36 2015 UTC,That's not at all what I saw when I've seen him.  And Valencia is ultra conservative at full back anyway.
reddevils,3e1gmd,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's conservative. He's very defensively aware but he really does get up the pitch, he's more similar to Coleman than Clyne if that helps things at all"
reddevils,3e1gmd,Hassi94,8,Tue Jul 21 12:10:46 2015 UTC,Valencia isn't good going forward at all.
reddevils,3e1gmd,RFerrer-,4,Tue Jul 21 09:27:38 2015 UTC,How was Valencia good going forward at all? Running forward isn't a big factor to being good at it though because that's the only thing he's good at for attacks nowadays unfortunately for us and him too.
reddevils,3e1gmd,Feezbull,6,Tue Jul 21 10:27:47 2015 UTC,Tony will start first game of the season
reddevils,3e1gmd,ng_sweatshirt,7,Tue Jul 21 09:44:54 2015 UTC,This is ridiculous.  Valencia is going to find it very difficult to get into this team.
reddevils,3e1gmd,ohyou123,5,Tue Jul 21 09:17:42 2015 UTC,Whaaaaat? I think Valencia did a pretty decent job last season but I think Darmian will take the starting spot from Tony.
reddevils,3e1gmd,Kagawabunga,6,Tue Jul 21 05:54:45 2015 UTC,"I like Valencia starting for us at RB, he has a great work rate and is usually the player on the field with the most tackles at the end of the game.  In my view him and Darmian are alot closer in ability than alot of people on this sub think.  I can see Darmian displacing him but I don't mind Valencia starting as RB for us, he's very often one of the better players on the pitch, very rarely one of the worst (or at least in my view).  He makes no more mistakes than Jones, Shaw, Blind, Smalling, Rojo, Rafael or Evans.  EDIT:  I think since Clevs and Welbeck left, fans have been looking for a scapegoat, I don't think it should be Tony"
reddevils,3e1gmd,januzaj_44,2,Tue Jul 21 10:12:45 2015 UTC,"Won't last, Darmian will be the #1"
reddevils,3e1gmd,maydaybomber,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:13:58 2015 UTC,He's going to ease him in to the first XI and English football instead of just throwing him out there. By seasons end I expect Darmian to be the first choice RB.
reddevils,3e1gmd,KKlondon86,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:35 2015 UTC,"Of course they're gonna battle for the starting spot, as it should be.   As an aside, I still think too many are overly critical of Toni."
reddevils,3e1gmd,FURyannnn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:48:37 2015 UTC,"Everyone saying LvG's English makes it sound worse than it is, but I honestly disagree. Remember Valencia was injured for the Club América game, who knows if Valencia would have been the one starting in the first half along with the team that featured most of our usual starters and if Darmian wouldn't have been in the team that played the second half instead.  Regardless, I really hope Darmian makes the starting RB place his sooner than later, and I think he will unless he gets off to a really bad start in England. I think Valencia is a good backup player to have but I think our chances at winning trophies would be much higher with Darmian as a starter."
reddevils,3e1gmd,omegaxLoL,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:53:12 2015 UTC,I don't understand why everyone is so so critical of Valencia as a right back. I thought he was more and more impressive as last season progressed. His stats stand up very well to other right backs!
reddevils,3e1gmd,hoochiscrazy_,7,Tue Jul 21 08:37:09 2015 UTC,"Stats mean fuck all in football, especially for a defender"
reddevils,3e1gmd,jacksteroo18,4,Tue Jul 21 09:00:22 2015 UTC,They mean fuck all when it suits. But when we want to praise a player or a transfer target suddenly it's all about the stats
reddevils,3e1gmd,hoochiscrazy_,0,Tue Jul 21 11:18:25 2015 UTC,"No, they mean fuck all regardless. I've seen people try and use them to compare players but it's pointless.   I don't know any stats that can evaluate positioning? For me that's just as important for a defender as any number of tackles made or interceptions."
reddevils,3e1gmd,jacksteroo18,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:25:28 2015 UTC,"Because good positioning results in lots of successful tackles and blocks. I agree stats don't mean an awful lot but they certainly give an indication. By the logic that stats mean ""fuck all"", a player that made 100 successful tackles and a player that made 0 are equally good. Clearly not."
reddevils,3e1gmd,hoochiscrazy_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:09 2015 UTC,Good positioning also means passes and attacks are not made in your direction or to players that you mark.  Tackles are frequently made to fix a mistake.
reddevils,3e1gmd,TanqPhil,0,Tue Jul 21 12:03:29 2015 UTC,"Rubbish, good positioning forces the attackers to run at different players. It could easily be that Smalling was very well positioned, forcing players wide straight into Tony.  I like Tony but trying to use stats like successful tackles to judge a defender is silly."
reddevils,3e1gmd,Hassi94,0,Tue Jul 21 12:14:43 2015 UTC,Good job no-one has done that then...
reddevils,3e1gmd,hoochiscrazy_,-8,Tue Jul 21 12:39:24 2015 UTC,Haha !!  A natural RB bought as a secondary option to cover a make-shift RB.  I hope he's joking.
reddevils,3e1gmd,aravindu43,13,Tue Jul 21 05:55:09 2015 UTC,"Considering Valencia has barely played anywhere but RB for over 2 years and has played at RB for our club starting from 2011 is he really makeshift RB? It's like calling Schweini a winger who's a makeshift midfielder.  If SAF can trust him to play RB several matches. If he's undroppable to SAF, Moyes and LvG do you think there's a reason he's a manager's favourite?  Maybe he has better tactical discipline and can follow complicated manager's orders better than most?  The he's out of position comments always seem lazy to me.  His biggest problem isn't his defence it's his rubbish attacking contribution and the fact his crossing/finishing ability has deserted him completely. Defensively he's no more out of position than any decent fullback and has been fairly immense.  If you want to talk out of position and can't read a match defensively look at Marcelo, Alba, Rafinha etc. Compared to them Valencia's fucking Maldini."
reddevils,3e1gmd,inu50kza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:08:23 2015 UTC,Was Giggs a winger when he finished with us?
reddevils,3e1gmd,birdy9221,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:54:28 2015 UTC,no he didn't really play winger at all his last few years. SAF used him more in a free drifting role and usually he played no. 10 or cm at a pinch.   hard to pin down a spot but he was central most of most matches. definitely not a winger.
reddevils,3e1gmd,inu50kza,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:27:13 2015 UTC,But he could run (to an extent) and read the game well. I assume that's how Van Gaal sees Valencia.
reddevils,3e1gmd,birdy9221,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:54:54 2015 UTC,Well it was pretty obvious that this was a backup buy.
reddevils,3e1gmd,nerongod,2,Tue Jul 21 11:29:49 2015 UTC,He's first choice. I think this is more down to LVG's English.
reddevils,3e1gmd,mink551,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:13:01 2015 UTC,Pretty obvious how?
reddevils,3e1gmd,omegaxLoL,0,Tue Jul 21 13:03:33 2015 UTC,That we bought a wing back that is not as good as Valencia.
reddevils,3e1gmd,nerongod,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:36:25 2015 UTC,You've got to be delusional to believe Valencia is better than Darmian at RB.

Almost all of the goals are pure technique and instinct.  17 in 52 for a backup striker is outstanding. Shame that he couldn't be fit throughout his career."
reddevils,3e1juz,WillyMorganOnTheWing,-8,Tue Jul 21 07:36:59 2015 UTC,"you can't deny that Owen is a great goalscorer   I think great is a stretch. Don't get me wrong he was extremely good, but in my view great goalscorers score 20 league goals in a season. He never did that and he missed too many chances. Once he lost his speed, he was half the player. He was best suited to a counter attacking team where he could run into open space.   Great goalscorers are like Van Nistelrooy and score no matter what. Van Nistelrooy wasn't as fast after his injury, but he had the instinct and adapted.   Edit: Even at his very best before his injuries he missed chances and didn't score over 20 league goals in a season. His pace was his best weapon, not his finishing or instinct. Plus saying that he was extremely good, but not great is hardly damning either. I just think great should be used sparingly. Is Robbie Keane great?"
reddevils,3e1juz,tenlittleindians,9,Tue Jul 21 10:31:31 2015 UTC,you really dont know who owen was in his prime do you
reddevils,3e1juz,WillyMorganOnTheWing,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:05:19 2015 UTC,Given I was physically in the stadium when he scored against Argentina in 1998...I think I know what he was like.
reddevils,3e1juz,tenlittleindians,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:40:11 2015 UTC,i mean he won a ballon dor because of his goalscoring. i think that makes him at one point a great goalscorer.
reddevils,3e1juz,WillyMorganOnTheWing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:43:14 2015 UTC,"I think it means he was Liverpool's best/most famous player when they won 3 trophies. It is also heavily linked with England's 5-1 against Germany. I think it is very arguable that he should not have won it that year. It also helped that this was before the Ballon D'Or was open to non-Europeans.   At no point have I disputed that he was very good. All I am disputing is that he is not great. Greatness is bestowed upon very few players.   Also, don't rely on tired arguments like ""well you obviously didn't watch him""."

reddevils,3e1juz,WillyMorganOnTheWing,0,Tue Jul 21 14:21:25 2015 UTC,"dude cmon youre trying to invalidate the best player in europe award because of a qualifier and his clubs success.    It is common knowledge that the players that win such awards tend to come from clubs who won trophies in that year. Do you disagree? Liverpool won a treble that year and it was a relatively uneventful year otherwise. I don't see how that ""invalidates the best player in europe award"".   then youre trying to say you cant be great if you rely on pace   I didn't say that. I said that great players have more than just pace and can adapt when they lose pace. Hence their greatness. I believe that by not being able to adapt, Owen belongs in the category of merely ""extremely good"".    come off it man torres was a prem great that happened to lose his pace and then faltered but theres still no denying what he once was.   Torres is an unusual case, but I stand by the idea that the very, very best players have more than pace. Do you understand the point I am making?    you cannot deny that owen was one of the great strikers of the late 90s early 2000s   Clearly I can. Again I will restate my opinion...he is an excellent player but not great. I believe great players are rare and are not reliant on one single physical attribute to mark them out as great. The greatest players are able to adapt. Look at how Ronaldo has adapted as he has aged as an example. Or how Van Nistelrooy changed his style after the cruciate. He wasn't the same free running player he was at PSV, but he was still a top class striker. Alan Shearer made a similar change in style after injury."

I see a distinct difference between a top player who didn't fulfill potential to actual great strikers. Owen had flaws that were exposed when he lost his pace. In my view, truly great strikers have more than just pace."
reddevils,3e1juz,wharsmetoothpicson,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:42:04 2015 UTC,But that's why I said it's all relative ;)
reddevils,3e1juz,WillyMorganOnTheWing,0,Tue Jul 21 14:08:36 2015 UTC,But we are being relative to greatness as a world level. I don't see the need to compare them to Frank Stapleton.
reddevils,3e1juz,benhanks040888,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:14:29 2015 UTC,"I'm just speaking of the techniques he used in those 17 goals. Top corner, bottom corner, curving shots, long range shots, headers, opportunist's instinct and positioning for those tap-ins and short range strikes. Everything you want from a striker.  In his Liverpool era, he actually managed 4 seasons just shy of your expectation of 20 league goals (2 seasons with 18, 2 seasons with 19). Bear in mind, that was when 20 goals a season is still a rarity, and he was only 18-24 years old! Are there any young players (less than 24 years old) now who have scored more than 100 goals?  About missing chances, everybody misses chances. Even Ronaldo or Messi or van Nistelrooy misses goal opportunities that are 99% should be goals."
reddevils,3e1juz,WillyMorganOnTheWing,0,Tue Jul 21 11:59:13 2015 UTC,"I'm well aware of what he like at his best. I'm well above the average age of users on here and was watching him with adult eyes.    In his Liverpool era, he actually managed 4 seasons just shy of your expectation of 20 league goals (2 seasons with 18, 2 seasons with 19).   I am not disputing that, in fact I specifically referenced that. My point is that he is merely extremely good as opposed to great.    Bear in mind, that was when 20 goals a season is still a rarity   No it wasn't. There were 2 seasons in 1997/98 and 1998/99 when goals were low but otherwise it has happened in every other season Owen was active. Kevin Phillips had a far more prolific season than Owen for example (Owen is obviously better than him, but I am using him as an example).   About missing chances, everybody misses chances.    I absolutely did not say that the top players don't miss chances, so don't insinuate I did. My point was that Owen was not as reliable as the very, very best.   My argument is that ""greatness"" is limited. We shouldn't throw it at every very good player. Even the ones who had potential to be better than just very good. Owen did not do enough to be great."

reddevils,3e1juz,Leif9er,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:10:20 2015 UTC,He's without a doubt a great finisher. His goal scoring record during his prime years with Liverpool and England was frightening. Only injuries stopped him destroying the England goals record.
reddevils,3e1juz,WillyMorganOnTheWing,0,Tue Jul 21 14:03:14 2015 UTC,Only injuries stopped him destroying the England goals record.   I would argue that almost all European countries have goalscorers with similar records in the last 15-20 years. There are simply more goals scored and more games played in modern football by first choice international strikers.   Breaking that record would have been extremely notable and historic but not groundbreaking in the truest sense. I used the example of Robbie Keane for a reason. He has 60+ international goals...is he a truly great striker? Or Jon Dahl Tomasson as he has 52. Hakan Şükür has 51. Jan Koller has 55.   All top strikers in international football have inflated goal tallies these days. Look at Peter Crouch. Again I will re-state that he is merely an extremely good player as opposed to great. I really think people need to read my words carefully instead of assuming saying he is not great automatically means I don't rate him. I clearly do as I have said so multiple times. But I have seen actual great players and Owen is not one of them. He is from the bracket below greatness.

reddevils,3e2uzb,StoopidFlexin,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:22 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure even on the East Coast it would have been any better as the main problem is the fact it switched from Berkley to San Jose so late in the day. They had over 40k already sold when it was in Berkley but have had less than 21 days to sell it in San Jose and while the distance between the two isn't that significant it's still over an hour which has to be enough to put off many from travelling.  Especially when there are MLB games on tonight including the Oakland A's at home (Plus other games in California of the LA Angels at home and the San Fran Giants going down to San Diego)
reddevils,3e2uzb,wakey87433,2,Tue Jul 21 16:11:06 2015 UTC,"It's just over an hour when you don't factor in god awful California traffic. Sure it's not ""rush hour"" out there at 8pm, but it's never easy driving through or around San Francisco."

reddevils,3e2uzb,StoopidFlexin,0,Tue Jul 21 16:52:29 2015 UTC,"While I personally agree MLB is the league with the highest total attendance in the world. Admittedly there are apparently 2426 games in a season compared to the 380 in the Premier League but it's still 5th in the average attendance behind the NFL, Bundesliga, Premier League and Autralian Football league BUT ahead of La Liga (which is only just ahead Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball which is also the 2nd most watched in total Attendees across the season).   So while you may find it a garbage sport and I also fail to see the attraction plenty of people love it and being up against Baseball matches will have a major impact when it was moved at the last minute"

reddevils,3e12dy,devil27,16,Tue Jul 21 10:58:11 2015 UTC,The most worrying thing I heard in this was that Darmian was bought as Valencia's number 2 at RB. Boy LvG does seem to be one of Valencia's biggest fan.
reddevils,3e12dy,fbgm_2,25,Tue Jul 21 04:15:06 2015 UTC,"Why is that worrying? He has to earn his spot. LVG doesn't care about names, if you perform well you will play."
reddevils,3e12dy,Feezbull,3,Tue Jul 21 04:24:39 2015 UTC,But maybe he rates Darmian as behind Valencia. Just like blind is behind Carrick so will hardly start over him in midfield ever.
reddevils,3e12dy,fbgm_2,7,Tue Jul 21 04:33:09 2015 UTC,I'm sure darmian will eventually start over Valencia not just at the beginning. Give it 3-5 months
reddevils,3e12dy,Feezbull,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:56:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah I expect that too because he is a better player overall as well anyway and has the work rate too so, it should pan out that way.  I do hope he starts the season though or at least, plays as early as possible to establish him so quickly. I just can't take more of- sprint fast, become stuck, pass it side or back, repeat, beat man at times, hit first man with cross."

reddevils,3e12dy,Hassi94,2,Tue Jul 21 05:36:26 2015 UTC,"I think he's just being respectful to Valencia. He can't say he's bought Darmian to play over Valencia when Darmian hasn't proved himself worthy of that. He may prove himself worthy during pre-season, or in August or maybe it will take until the Christmas period - who knows."
reddevils,3e12dy,shtzkrieg,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:22:58 2015 UTC,I wouldn't worry. LVG isn't stupid. Darmian will be starting whenever he's fit.
reddevils,3e12dy,FURyannnn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:21:18 2015 UTC,"Not the same since Carrick is easily a better player than Blind. Regardless, I do like the Valencia/Darmian pairing as it gives us good depth at that position."

reddevils,3e12dy,minus_one,6,Tue Jul 21 12:42:38 2015 UTC,"I think that's expected. Probably Darmian is a better at RB technically, he isn't used to the PL. Nothing wrong in slowly building him up and easing him into the league. Its not easy to get into the PL."

If you go by Graham Hunter Woodward decided to get him on deadline day after Moyes had asked for more time for scouting him, which was a general fault of Moyes that frustrated Woodward.

reddevils,3e1j9o,PhilJonesIsTheGOAT,6,Tue Jul 21 13:31:27 2015 UTC,Sky bet have Rooney at 100/30 to score 20+ goals in 15/16 season. I might stick a few quid on that. I think if he stays fit he'll bang goals in for us this season.
reddevils,3e1j9o,LiamRS24,3,Tue Jul 21 08:49:31 2015 UTC,Yes Rooney will be a 20 goal Striker next season. But he won't reach 30. IMO.
reddevils,3e1j9o,TY1901,6,Tue Jul 21 06:47:28 2015 UTC,34+ is in all comps. 20  goal striker is usually referring to PL only
reddevils,3e1j9o,Hassi94,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:04:39 2015 UTC,I don't see it happening but would love to be wrong as he will most likely play every game as long as he is fit. Imop he wants the ball far to much and is not comfortable running in behind defenders. I know he's scored a lot of goals for united but I would argue had any half decent striker been given the amount of games for United that he has they would be close to his goal record.
reddevils,3e1j9o,Fuckthisshitagain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:25:46 2015 UTC,"Very confident that he can replicate it. Rooney isn't like Costa or Kane who are on form for a month or two and go on to score tons of goals. Rooney is consistently scoring during the season that we don't realise he has scored many goals. He drops because he has to cover for the midfield which was not looked into. Now that we have the Sch partnership, he will put his trust on them and stay higher up the pitch. He also said it so I can't wait :P"
reddevils,3e1j9o,boijek,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:38:36 2015 UTC,He'll hit 20+ easily but less because of his diminishing quality and more because of the much higher quality in midfield behind him
reddevils,3e1j9o,sunny1993s,2,Tue Jul 21 13:08:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see it TBH. None of our strikers (established players) looked well in LvG philosophy and I think it is the main problem. We do not create enough chances, especially from the wings. If that changes somehow, than I can see Roo running riot. But first preseason game showed us more of the same."
reddevils,3e1j9o,edmontom,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:36:58 2015 UTC,"Agreed, our midfield has good goal scoring ability but the lack of chances they create hurt last season. Hope this season will be different. Then Rooney can definitely have a good goalscoring season."
reddevils,3e1j9o,ireallyamsomething,0,Tue Jul 21 07:18:39 2015 UTC,"I don't see it. It's not like he has played most of his matches out of position at any point. His declining returns are to me down to his discipline, he is good enough to score well over 20 a year but he would prefer to be seen as having a high work rate so ends up going looking for the ball too much. Even towards the end of last season when he was deployed as a sole striker there was only the Spurs gane where he really embraced the striker role and kept the defenders occupied the whole game, in the others he spent too much time going looking for the ball deep and compacted space. When he did lead the line he made things happen, for example right at the end of the Newcastke game he seemed to stop going looking for the ball and from that pressure he put on the defenders we scored. So he needs to break that desire to be seen as always being involved and I'm not sure it's possible for him to do so at this point because it's a quality he has gained rave review for as in England we seem to put effort as higher that efficency even if the effort is being used incorrectly and in a way that hinders the team"
reddevils,3e1j9o,wakey87433,5,Tue Jul 21 08:54:04 2015 UTC,"Rooney needs support. If the team can provide it he can easily score more than 20. When he had his best season as a striker we had Valencia and Nani in brilliant form. The good thing is, now we have adequate cover in midfield that we don't need to push Rooney there when he can still lead the front line. He needs to start as a striker as he score a butt load of his goals in succession and moving him might impede his chance of scoring in a game. I hope we don't buy a striker too, I'd rather give Wilson, Hernandez or an upcoming youth a chance. With our midfield any striker will improve,  can't wait for the season to start now."
reddevils,3e1j9o,meledge93,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:22:46 2015 UTC,"He wasn't having to play as a Midfilder most of last season but that didn't stop him dropping deep all the time and going looking for the ball leaving us without a focal point for the attack and closing up others space. It isn't the players around him that are holding Rooney back, it's his own attitude that it's better to be busy than effective. A striker doesn't need to be bombing around the pitch, you didn't see RvN doing so for example. He just concerned himself with occupying the defenders which created space for other to attack into and then he was automatically in a dangerous position when the ball came into the box.  Rooney has the problem that Beckham had when he was made England captain. Beckham won rave reviews for his work rate as he was all over the pitch, it endeared him to the fans and the media. However him going looking for the ball meant he was going into others space while leaving his right wing position empty so while the effort looked great it was damaging as a team."

reddevils,3e1j9o,kw9403,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:48:31 2015 UTC,"Can you substantiate your claim that Rooney has played in midfield or on the wing each season since 2011-12?  I think if you look at the numbers, what has actually happened is this: Rooney has intermittently played in midfield and on the wing, but overall his efficacy as a striker has decreased enormously. The midfield thing last year is such a red herring.  He played 33 games last year, with 0.3 per game. By my count 6 of those games saw him feature as a central midfielder. So his tally as a striker is 0.4 goals per game. That gets him to 15 league goals with 38 games as a striker.  I will happily bet gold with anyone who thinks Rooney is going to get 25 league goals next season. He won't do it."

reddevils,3e0y3v,spoofex,7,Tue Jul 21 09:23:41 2015 UTC,Pretty anti-climatic haha. Still wish Memphis gets played on the wing though.
reddevils,3e0y3v,King-Eric,3,Tue Jul 21 02:55:13 2015 UTC,Don't understand what purpose that serves. Wouldn't it be better to mix it up and try different player combinations?
reddevils,3e0y3v,TheDrySkinOnYourKnee,5,Tue Jul 21 03:15:42 2015 UTC,Maybe he does those in training and this is the best for a match
reddevils,3e0y3v,littIehobbitses,2,Tue Jul 21 04:44:29 2015 UTC,He's got an A squad and B squad. They get rotated every 2 match as we march towards the quadruple!

reddevils,3e0y3v,Panda12341234,6,Tue Jul 21 03:50:59 2015 UTC,It's pre season and he's just mixing it up to fit the players. Not fun but it achieves his goal I suppose.
reddevils,3e0y3v,Feezbull,3,Tue Jul 21 03:11:37 2015 UTC,"I was just watching all Mata goals he scored for Chelsea ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0qOeLkWwHo) and I wonder why we play him on the wing instead of a 10, CAM - closer to the goal. He's a brilliant player"
reddevils,3e0y3v,edmontom,3,Tue Jul 21 04:47:06 2015 UTC,"Because Mata is still too slight and not quick enough to press etc from the middle like Herrera would be able to do for instance. I agree that's his best position and he's wasted out wide in fact despite being decent/good/very good at times but he's quite limited there too.   The fact is that it seems LvG very much prefers a player like Herrera who can hold his own defensively and put in a good shift in the middle as well on top of passing and vision. In fact, maybe those outweigh passing and vision by a small bit as clearly, mata edges Herrera or anyone for that role but lacks a lot in the physicality, pace and all instead.   I would say pereira looks to be more physically suited than Mata even now possibly. I do hope we see him more in the middle though for certain games and such."
reddevils,3e0y3v,Feezbull,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:45:57 2015 UTC,"I was wondering how Juan would look in last seasons 4-3-3 playing in Fellaini's position (aka Sneijder in LvG 4-3-3 Holland). But will never know, I guess.  edit: a word"
reddevils,3e0y3v,edmontom,2,Tue Jul 21 06:26:56 2015 UTC,He keeps losing the ball in the middle.  He drifted in twice against america and got run over by the press. He did this countless times last season. It's why Mourinho moved him to the wing.   He has terrible possession retention in tight areas when pressed heavily.
reddevils,3e0y3v,inu50kza,2,Tue Jul 21 06:11:47 2015 UTC,"""Terrible posession retention"" - shame to say this kind of thing about one of Spain's most technically gifted midfielders. But it's kind of true.."
reddevils,3e0y3v,edmontom,2,Tue Jul 21 06:29:46 2015 UTC,I was really hoping Memphis and Young wouldn't play at the same half. Would like to have seen Memphis as a LW this time.
reddevils,3e0y3v,reddit_no_likey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:28:21 2015 UTC,"I think maybe the Barcelona game could be the one we see that. He still wants to experiment with roles and all and also focus on different aspects of the game specifically for the moment to put aside the actual team and line up as of now.   A little disappointing as fans but hey, that's what pre season is for anyway- preparation in every aspect for the season."
reddevils,3e0y3v,Feezbull,2,Tue Jul 21 05:47:25 2015 UTC,So i have to wait longer to see mata/herrera :(
reddevils,3e0y3v,gme37,7,Tue Jul 21 03:06:32 2015 UTC,"Even longer to see Bastian, Morgan and Herrera/pereira in the midfield three.  Mata, as good as he is, is quite limited when playing out wide honestly. He doesn't offer pace and isn't strong enough so he always has to cut back and make a safer pass or a cross field pass instead. I rate him highly but not out wide though."
reddevils,3e0y3v,Feezbull,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:42:22 2015 UTC,"Disagree. Not his strongest pos, but he's very productive there as well"
reddevils,3e0y3v,Happytom82,2,Tue Jul 21 08:40:14 2015 UTC,"He's not actually very productive except for those few games. The only things he can do from that area are cut in, cross field passes and then safe passes.   He lacks the pace to beat a man nor does he dribble past men like what Iniesta or Isco would do. He doesn't have the strength to bully his way past too so he frequently has to make safe passes when under pressure to retain possession. He can't stretch the field of play to the right and makes it smaller in fact as he always comes inside the pitch.   Valencia being useless in attack means he can't link up too well with him for an overlap and a proper cross.   He's good but hardly special out wide. In fact, in this current squad, if di Maria is on form or Memphis is able to play wide right, I'd drop mata easily for the wing spot.   Sure given space, he does a lot better but that's what mata needs- space. His best aspects are those passes he can thread from the middle to give our wingers or striker through balls to run onto and such. Or those lobbed passes. Basically, his vision and passing but that's curtailed out wide. In the middle with little defensive responsibilities- he's excellent. Even with a bit less space as he has more room to think and all that. Out wide? We have better players on our team honestly."

reddevils,3e1uwl,Pint_Of_Bitter,4,Tue Jul 21 08:51:13 2015 UTC,"Louis van Gaal has admitted he was uncomfortable when taking over Manchester United last summer due to the makeup of the squad, pointing to how he has pruned 17 players since then.  Ahead of a second season in charge, Van Gaal feels the club is better placed, largely due to four new players – Bastian Schweinsteiger, Matteo Darmian, Memphis Depay and Morgan Schneiderlin – already having been recruited in the transfer window to make a total of 10 signings under Van Gaal.  When taking over last close season Van Gaal had to ask some of the squad to change where they operated. While these included Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia, who played at wingback in the team’s 3-5-2 shape, Van Gaal stated he was unable to voice his reservations due to a need to offer the best message.  “Yes, I could not say that last year because you have to be always positive as a manager about your selection but there’s a difference now,” the Dutchman said. “We already have four new players and training already on tour with the four new players. But the biggest difference is the balance in the team. Last year also in the US tour I had to line up the players in different positions than what they’re used to playing which is not good. So now for every position I have two players.   Some interesting and frank comments from LVG here on what I think we all felt about last year's squad and lack of depth."

reddevils,3dyse7,-Zenith-,23,Mon Jul 20 17:12:49 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? Because £70m actually sounds reasonable if (post Champions League winning) di Maria is about £60m  Muller is pure class  EDIT: Muller's contract would, conservatively, be about £35m over 5 years meaning, if you are right, the transfer bid to Bayern would only be £35m, that would be paltry.   I'd say a bid+contract+fees value would be in and around £110m-£130m  EDIT2: The article basically confirms it by saying that the transfer at €100m would be a 'trademark for the club' (thanks Google Translate!)"

reddevils,3dyse7,exxpired,2,Mon Jul 20 17:31:38 2015 UTC,"It's something that certain elements in the media have begun in order to drive clicks. 'Club makes shock massive X amount bid for trending player' - that's the headline, but when you look closer they're including the player's proposed contract and the agent fees in X.  I remember an Ogden piece last year saying we were going to bid something like 160m for Bale, but when you opened up the article it became clear that part of that value was the wages."
reddevils,3dyse7,glintings,3,Mon Jul 20 17:34:41 2015 UTC,That doesn't make sense to me. That would be a really low transfer fee then. €100m just to Bayern makes sense. Not that they would accept that either but it's a more realistic number.

He probably has good communication channels with Muller and any bid is probably made with the provisio that the player is open to a move.  Bayern won't accept any bid though probably.

reddevils,3e09s1,D1794,17,Mon Jul 20 23:32:52 2015 UTC,Main points   Muller 'open to move' 'Flattered by interest' We haven't given up hope of signing him for £55m Bayern standing firm and don't want to lose a key figure + fan favourite Would potentially earn 265k p/w No formal bid made Talks about Pep/Muller fall out and Muller was dropped. Bayern chief doesn't want Bundesliga falling behind PL and picking off their players would aid that.
reddevils,3e09s1,kmp214246,14,Tue Jul 21 00:07:11 2015 UTC,"Bayern chief doesn't want Bundesliga falling behind PL and picking off their players would aid that.   If he were worried about the quality of the Bundesliga, maybe he should stop picking off all of the talent. If anything, selling us Muller would improve the balance in the league."
reddevils,3e09s1,svtom,5,Tue Jul 21 00:52:14 2015 UTC,I think he means 'I don't want Manchester United to over take Bayern'. He wants Bayern to have the best possible chance in the champions league
reddevils,3e09s1,Nostrabrahmus,11,Tue Jul 21 01:07:34 2015 UTC,"Muller 'open to move' 'Flattered by interest'   If true, this is gigantic news.  He didn't come out and say eh, nah.  If he's genuinely open to it I think we can convince him somehow.....£££££££££"
reddevils,3e09s1,ZxentixZ,3,Tue Jul 21 00:37:11 2015 UTC,It honestly wouldn't suprise me if Muller wanted to play for us but it's no way in hell he is leaving Bayern. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge clearly stated that he isn't selling any more players to us. Rummenigge and Guardiola was criticized by both the media and the fans for selling Schweinsteiger that there is no way they are selling another one of their star players. He might have had a fall out with Guardiola but Pep is leaving next season for City so it won't really matter. Muller is so important to Bayern and both the club and Guardiola knows that. They're not a selling club and are not in a position where they need to sell.
reddevils,3e09s1,freakedmind,3,Tue Jul 21 00:56:38 2015 UTC,I don't think Utd has high hopes of landing him as they know he is integral to their team.
reddevils,3e09s1,atero,4,Mon Jul 20 23:45:14 2015 UTC,I can't in my wildest dreams envision this being a possibility.
reddevils,3e09s1,SureAviator,6,Tue Jul 21 01:21:52 2015 UTC,Mueller is not on. There's a limit to how much we can bid and offer salaries too.  Around 30M + 5-10M on salaries for him and then on top of that £70M + (minimum Bayern would even contemplate selling him) + 10M in salaries and we're looking at 120M+...just not gonna happen unless Di Maria leaves...which I really don't want to happen.
reddevils,3e09s1,D1794,19,Tue Jul 21 00:08:38 2015 UTC,"Muller > Di Maria. Selling ADM and bringing in Muller would only improve us drastically.  The bad point of this move is that Mata would be basically be perma-benched. Muller/Memphis would always be the favoured options either side of Rooney.  Unless LVG had faith in 2 holding CMs, so either Carrick/Basti Morgan/Basti Carrick/Morgan and plays Mata at the tip of a CM 3...But then Herrera is benched too. (yeah it's basically a 4-2-3-1, but the two formations are incredibly similar anyway)  --------------Basti----Morgan----------  ------------------Mata-------------------  ---Muller-----Rooney---Memphis----  That will win trophies."
reddevils,3e09s1,astarkey12,6,Tue Jul 21 00:12:55 2015 UTC,I shudder to even think of that front 3. That would be unbelievably awesome to watch. Trying to keep all expectations as low as possible though so I'm pleasantly surprised by any farfetched signings.   I do think Muller is too good to be true. It's still early in the window regardless.
reddevils,3e09s1,duckofwolfstreet,2,Tue Jul 21 00:24:16 2015 UTC,I'm with you buddy. Right now I'm telling myself or surprise signing is Charlie Austin and that will be the end of our business. I lived the vidal loca for the final time last year.
reddevils,3e09s1,Nostrabrahmus,4,Tue Jul 21 11:53:02 2015 UTC,"which I really don't want to happen.   Mate at this point I think it's become clear that DiMa is on his way out.  He doesn't want to be here.  PSG are after him and we can't show weakness until we have a replacement.  Given the opportunity, I would swap Muller for Di Maria in a god damn heartbeat."
reddevils,3e09s1,wr712,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:35:47 2015 UTC,I am fully against selling Di Maria but if selling him means we get Muller then by all means.

This yeah they had Andy Cole and Dennis Irwin doing a talk and answering questions it was pretty cool.
reddevils,3e0m87,kjabs87,10,Tue Jul 21 12:29:48 2015 UTC,I went over for spring break and saw two games at OT. Dont forget the flight is roughly 8-12 hours depending where ur coming from in the US. So that is 2 days alone plus the 2 hour train/flight from london to Manchester. Unless you fly directly. I flew to London and took the train to Manchester. Hotel Im not sure on as I stayed with a friend studying abroad but tickets will cost about 100-150 US dollars ( I went in 2010 thats what it cost then. about 50 euro was about 100 bucks then. I went to an epl and a champions league game (Fulham and Ac Milan for becks return). I think I spent around a grand at that time for flight. I went to OT drove past emptihad in a taxi. Thats about all I did in Manchester cause I was staying in Wales. So i really just popped in from the train to the stadium and back. I went on the tour of the stadium and then the museum one day. and then game a dif day and a game a dif day. So i was in town for 3 dif days. It was amazing. Not sure of what else to do tho.
reddevils,3e0m87,kjabs87,6,Tue Jul 21 01:53:51 2015 UTC,"This sounds great. If I could be so fortunate to snag both PL AND Champs League I'd be ecstatic. I wasn't thinking about the long flight though, so I guess we'll assume a minimum 2 day stay in England, possibly longer. Perhaps up to a full week's worth of activities (including flights et al).  Good looking out!"
reddevils,3e0m87,kjabs87,6,Tue Jul 21 03:36:05 2015 UTC,I was on a forum about 6 months before I go and I asked about tickets and some random guy said that he could get me tickets to the Fulham game. Then when I got there the weekend before the game he emailed me and asked if I wanted 1 ticket for the Ac Milan game. And I said hell ya. So I actually went to the game with him. Nice guy and he just gave me 2 season tickets for the weekends game against Fulham and told me to give the 2 tickets to the people next to us. So I did. It was amazing. But ya def take into account the travel time.

reddevils,3e0m87,jackets0601,8,Tue Jul 21 05:11:09 2015 UTC,"It can be a lot cheaper than you'd expect. Consider staying somewhere cheap, there'll be plenty of availability in winter. Cheap doesn't necessarily mean bad, and if you go the hostel route, you'll undoubtedly meet some amazing people. Especially if you're going for only 3 or 4 days, I can't imagine it would take years to save for, but obviously I don't understand your personal situation.   I'm not from the US, but last winter I flew WOW Air between Boston and London for roughly $350 return. A quick search tells me that if you headed over in December this year you'd be looking at around $500, that's with WOW Air. I was lucky to jump on a deal — you can often do better than that if you know where to look, and when to buy (they're offering $99 flights from Boston to Paris at the moment, for example). Transferring to Manchester will add an extra $50 or so.   You can stay at the YHA in Manchester for about $20 a night in winter. It's cheap, you'll be bunking with others, but if you want to save your pennies, it's a brilliant option. To me, hostels are more appealing than hotels, but everyone is different. Especially if you're traveling solo. Don't worry, there's plenty of 25-30 year olds in these places.   Tickets plus membership will probably be something like $100-$150.   I think food in England is about 1.5x more expensive than America. So factor your usual food budget, plus about 50% extra.   Honestly, you could do it all for under $1000 if you really wanted to. I think $2000 would be sufficient to be comfortable, but I probably have a very frugal lifestyle in most people's opinion. I have friends on the East Coast who've done weekends in Paris for $500 total. Travelling doesn't have to be the big deal a lot of people think it is - not saying you think that way, just in general a lot of people do. Definitely get out there and do it!"
reddevils,3e0m87,al_pie,3,Tue Jul 21 01:56:46 2015 UTC,"So hostels over hotels seems to be one of the keys here...fun times!  Honestly, the budgeting so far in advance is partly because I have other more pressing important things to pay for in the shorter term (car repairs and things of the like) and then I also have a horrible ability to spend every bit of cash on me when travelling (it WAS budgeted money after all haha) so the more I save up the better. Ideally I'll be switching to a higher paying job in about a year, cutting down on my wait time tremendously. But I got to budget with what I currently got going on unfortunately.  Thanks for the info!  P.S.  Is the YHA similar to like a YMCA over in the States? I heard from some Village People it's fun to stay there...I'll show myself out"

Both times, I flew into London and did some traveling throughout England and Dublin.   I went this past Christmas with a buddy, and my round trip to London was about $1200. I was able to find a good hotel in Manchester for about $150/night. United membership and my Boxing Day match ticket were about $100 total. I would definitely recommend traveling with a friend so you an split hotel/hostel costs.   If you are just planning on staying in Manchester for 4 days, I would expect everything to cost about $2500 when its all said in done ($3000 if you're like me and spend 75% of your time at pubs). If you're interested in making it an extended trip with some traveling, PM me and I can send you a spreadsheet of costs my friend and I put together for our past trip that included plane, train, hotel costs, etc."

Staying with someone will definitely help, but if you do you need to make sure you clarify who, when, and for how long. Customs tried to be dicks when I went because I was winging it, I do not advise that at all. If you want super cheap lodging with absolutely no amenities except a shower the Salford Arms is pretty damn solid, I was able to walk to Old Trafford drunk as hell in an hour from there.   The whole trip cost me around $2k including my plane, train, and stay. I was also eating very well and hitting 2-4 pubs a day while sight seeing in London. If you want a full experience I would say do a full week with half in London and then up to Manchester for the second half. You'll get in some lovely sights and be able to enjoy yourself without stupid time constraints. If you have any questions about my trip or any help you would need feel free to ask."

reddevils,3e1xb5,fergieschewinggum,8,Tue Jul 21 09:23:50 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah he would. If he joined, he'd be the best RW in the squad, and allows van Gaal to play Angel at LCM."
reddevils,3e1xb5,Allard1994,16,Tue Jul 21 09:27:11 2015 UTC,There's no way Van Gaal will play Di Maria at LCM. Just look at our midfield.
reddevils,3e1xb5,slaystation25,10,Tue Jul 21 09:40:55 2015 UTC,Actually I think Di Maria-Schneinderlin-Schweinsteiger is a more balanced midfield than Di Maria-Carrick-Herrera which is the best we could have done before. I understand it means dropping Carrick and Herrera but it's certainly there as an option.
reddevils,3e1xb5,DaveIsMe,9,Tue Jul 21 10:31:33 2015 UTC,"Herrera seems to fit into Van Gaal's philosophy better, loses the ball less than Di Maria does — so he's better at sustaining the possession, and he's better defensively. He doesn't mind a few flying tackles, and doesn't get injured too often while he's at it.  Van Gaal doesn't rate Di Maria as a midfielder. That became pretty clear towards the end of last season."
reddevils,3e1xb5,slaystation25,4,Tue Jul 21 10:34:18 2015 UTC,Van Gaal doesn't rate Di Maria as a midfielder. That became pretty clear towards the end of last season.   Nothing about the end of last season is meaningful. LVG spent the entire year talking about the lack of balance and why he had to make weird selections like Rooney or why Fellaini was favoured when he usually wouldn't be. This year we have balance so the parameters are completely different.
reddevils,3e1xb5,G_Morgan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:06:17 2015 UTC,"Herrera seems to fit into Van Gaal's philosophy better, loses the ball less than Di Maria does   I agree with this, which is why I think it's just an option, I just think that our midfield additions actually make it more possible to do rather than less.   Van Gaal doesn't rate Di Maria as a midfielder. That became pretty clear towards the end of last season.   In all fairness most people wouldn't rate Di Maria in any position at the end of last season, that was (hopefully) just a patch of bad form, he was terrible in any position at that point."
reddevils,3e1xb5,DaveIsMe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:42:50 2015 UTC,"1) Di Maria is vastly superior at ACM than Ander Herrera.  2) Di Maria would be playing in front of Schneiderlin/Schweinsteiger, both of whom rarely give the ball away. We don't need another 'possession sustainer'; we need a creator.   Van Gaal doesn't rate Di Maria as a midfielder. That became pretty clear towards the end of last season.   But you don't know the reasons for that. Maybe LVG didn't think Herrera was capable enough defensively for Maria to play next to him, which is certainly plausible."
reddevils,3e1xb5,oolalaa,4,Tue Jul 21 11:14:55 2015 UTC,"Depends on how you want to play of course.  Di Maria is notorious for losing possession frequently, sometimes for no reasons at all. Sure, he makes more ambitious forward passes that is always a risk, but Herrera is also more than capable to make those kinds of passes, just with more thought-out regard of positional awareness of the team.  You don't try a fancy pass when there's a risk of a dangerous counter from the opposition. Di Maria IMO lacks of the awareness of when to wait for it and when to go for it."
reddevils,3e1xb5,benhanks040888,-1,Tue Jul 21 12:07:02 2015 UTC,"Di Maria is notorious for losing possession frequently, sometimes for no reasons at all.    And notorious for creating 2 chances every single game. Which is about 1.5 more than Herrera is capable of.   but Herrera is also more than capable to make those kinds of passes   No he's not. Herrera might be the most overrated 30mil 'creator' I think I've ever seen. The guy can't even spray 35 yard diagonals, let alone consistently collapse a defense with incisive through balls.   just with more thought-out regard of positional awareness of the team.   His defensive positioning is better than Di Maria's, but it's hardly very good. His main defensive contribution is his tackling/energy.   You don't try a fancy pass when there's a risk of a dangerous counter from the opposition. Di Maria IMO lacks of the awareness of when to wait for it and when to go for it.   Di Maria is not prone to losing it in dangerous positions/situations. He generally gives it away with his wayward crossing/overly ambitious through balls.  And Herrera lost the ball many times in dangerous areas last season."
reddevils,3e1xb5,oolalaa,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:34:49 2015 UTC,"Well, they're not even the same type of players, so it's futile to compare them. A much fairer comparison would be with Mata or Depay.   Herrera might be the most overrated 30mil 'creator' I think I've ever seen   Then di Maria must be the most overrated 60mil I've ever seen, but I won't say that just yet. He might prove me wrong this season if he doesn't go to PSG.  But you can't undermine Herrera's ability just by stat alone. Even Scholes only averages 1 key passes per game throughout his career (based on WhoScored stat), but that doesn't mean he can't make deadly through pass right? Different type of players."
reddevils,3e1xb5,benhanks040888,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:13 2015 UTC,"Then di Maria must be the most overrated 60mil I've ever seen   Lol, even though, unlike Herrera, he's demonstrated his incredible, World-11 creativity for most of a season? (13/14)    Even Scholes only averages 1 key passes per game throughout his career (based on WhoScored stat), but that doesn't mean he can't make deadly through pass right?    His game was all about controlling tempo, feeding the ball into the right areas at the right time, and hockey assists. And that's Herrea's game to a large extent. But, like I said initially (which you ignored), We don't need another 'possession sustainer'; we need a creator."
reddevils,3e1xb5,oolalaa,3,Tue Jul 21 16:37:56 2015 UTC,It is certainly workable and I'm not sure why people are so quick to rule it out. ADM couldn't play there last year because we needed additional defensive contribution from the 3rd midfielder*. With Schneiderlin in the team it is entirely possible LVG will be comfortable with ADM as the 3rd midfielder. I'm not saying it will definitely happen but it could happen.  The biggest issue standing in the way is not his defence but the fact he gives the ball away too cheaply.  *who is usually an attacking player in LVGs systems. Think Sneijder or Iniesta
reddevils,3e1xb5,G_Morgan,3,Tue Jul 21 12:04:34 2015 UTC,There's absolutely no logic in that as Di Maria hasn't been the first choice right winger either. And because of Pedro on the right wing it doesn't give Di Maria suddenly the ability of never losing the ball.

reddevils,3e0ld6,JustinC00,-2,Tue Jul 21 01:48:26 2015 UTC,That's because Valencia are being cunts about the 35m.
reddevils,3e0ld6,n3o7,5,Tue Jul 21 03:20:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think we will sign anybody till we get back from the USA Tour, but I hope I'm wrong"
reddevils,3e0ld6,reddit_no_likey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:10:25 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. And the articles/twitterfeed will reflect that around August. It'll be buzzing with up to the minute updates on the situation.  Until then, ""everything is a process."""
reddevils,3e0ld6,blorimer542,2,Tue Jul 21 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"""Rumours of an impending bid from United for Nicolas Otamendi, the Valencia centre-half, continue to gather pace and yet the persistent speculation remains a source of considerable head-scratching among the top brass at Old Trafford. Well-placed figures at the club insist there is no interest in Otamendi, with one actually putting the rumour in the infamous Nicolas Gaitan bracket. Gaitan, the Benfica midfielder, has been linked heavily with a move to United for the past four summers, including this one, despite the Manchester club never having an interest in the player. David Gill, the former United chief executive, once got so sick of stories linking Gaitan with United that he rang up Benfica to instruct the club to stop perennially linking United with the Argentinian in a bid to create a market for him. Valencia seem to now be doing very much the same with their own Argentinian, Otamendi.""  If this is true, Ramos seems to be the only CB we are after. Not sure we are serious about John Stones. Though I feel we need more experienced CB, to lead the defence."
reddevils,3e0ld6,burlycabin,-3,Tue Jul 21 01:09:09 2015 UTC,"If United end up not signing a centre back before the window closes, my optimism for the upcoming season would quickly switch to pessimism.  Edit: As has been pointed out to me, pessimism is the wrong choice of word. What I meant to say was that I would have severe doubts over United providing a title challenge (reasonable expectation this season for me) if they did not bring in a quality centre back."
reddevils,3e0ld6,Nostrabrahmus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:40:14 2015 UTC,Seriously? You would be pessimistic with the midfield we've put together? We had the 4th best defense last year. We aren't exactly crap.
reddevils,3e0ld6,burlycabin,11,Tue Jul 21 01:54:20 2015 UTC,"In a way, I agree with him.  I certainly wouldn't be pessimistic, but I would most definitely be concerned.  Without a new CB, we are one or two injuries away from being in serious defensive trouble.  Also, we lack a leader at the back.  Rooney up top, Schweiny in the middle.  We definitely lack that Ramos like figure in defense.  If we are to compete with the Bayerns, Barca's, and Madrids, then we most definitely need another CB."
reddevils,3e0ld6,blorimer542,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:03:56 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree, we really could use a class defender. However, it's just dumb to be pessimistic without one."
reddevils,3e0ld6,burlycabin,4,Tue Jul 21 02:07:35 2015 UTC,"Perhaps pessimism was the wrong choice of word. I meant it in the sense that anything below a title challenge would be a bit of a failure this season in my opinion, and that I would have severe doubts over United providing one without a quality centre back addition."
reddevils,3e0ld6,Illum503,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:10 2015 UTC,"That's fair. I'm still pretty confident that we'll be well in for a title challenge with or without a new CB. However, a new class CB would make us likely champions league contenders.  All assuming the new Ryan m team gels together."

If you ask reporters who cover United, you'd know that Stuart Mathieson is a well respected journalist. After the Munich crash, Manchester Evening News have had only 2 reporters who's only beat is Manchester United - David Meek who covered United for some 35 yrs and Stuart who has been covering United since the 90's. David Meek, who was Mathieson's mentor, had unprecedented access to Fergie... he used to call him up anytime he wanted and also used to ghost-write the programme notes and that continued in Mathieson's early years.  In '96 or '97, M.E.N ran a poll asking some thing that Fergie didn't like and he never treated them the same after. They still got scoops through Meek who used to freelance for them and also apparently Fergie directly leaked info to Stuart a few times. But all that changed after the Rock of Gibraltar and other controversies - All journalists were shunned and they could rarely speak to Fergie expect during pressers.   In the last 8 to 10 yrs, leaks have been generally given to major national newspapers and they are preferred to the small local newspaper because of the readership numbers. But in the past couple of years it's gotten better. If you read the M.E.N religiously, you'd notice that they've gotten a lot better lately. Of course, things go wrong now and then as they are under constant pressure to get new stories and they exaggerate rumors, produce nonsense click-baity opinion pieces with more pictures than sentences but to be quite honest, most media do that."
reddevils,3dz5uz,freckleddemon,2,Mon Jul 20 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I know Stuart's brother quite well and he tells me that even though Stuart is a city fan, he recognises that he makes a living out of reporting on United. He's not the kind of guy to make stuff up. He's always been on the inside."

Im saying they are 100% unreliable now, The big difference between now and then is now the club only release news to selected outlets and MEN is certainly not one of them. Secondly when they got bought out and went clickbait a few years ago they lost all of the remaining credibility they had (which ended with me when then made a story out of someones Wiki page changing).   As reliable and respected he was, he certainly isnt now."

reddevils,3dz5uz,YoungJump,0,Mon Jul 20 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"Its how this subreddit works.   If someone posts something that suits their agenda - Hes the most brilliant, best source we have with personal connections to Ed, LVG and Giggs wife.  If someone posts something it doesnt suit someones agenda - Hes the worst journalist on the internet and should quit the industry and kill himself.  Dont know what it is with this place this summer, whether reddit has got more popular and thus we have got more popular or just this place is getting recognition as being reliable so more people are coming but either way we have had a big influx of people and in turn we have have got really more circlejerky with this kind of information.

reddevils,3dxhk0,craigybacha,40,Mon Jul 20 11:19:30 2015 UTC,It's just a small bit of human interest to add a little colour to the story. Many footballers are portrayed as covered in tattoos and spending their nights in Panacea reviewing the lucky local talent about to get roasted. This is obviously a piece written to add a small bit of human interest to the article. He is not literally saying that not liking tattoos equals professionalism.

It's not the striker the media has written, but you have to wait and see.  The transfer window is open... we have to wait.

reddevils,3dzus4,Ronin_Dizz88,7,Mon Jul 20 21:38:08 2015 UTC,"Indications are that United are comfortable with their current squad   Which is why LVG said he wants to buy at least 2 more players? And am I the only one who thinks journalists in England are getting briefed by the club about not having interest in Otamendi & Ramos is our first choice? I mean sure LVG would prefer Ramos but he knows also Real Madrid won't let him leave. Same thing about Pedro. Sure it's not just something to ''scare'' PSG because they were also interested in Pedro and if they go on and sign him, they will just forget about Di Maria? Or am I fantasizing too much now haha."
reddevils,3dzus4,therosepetal,4,Mon Jul 20 21:43:25 2015 UTC,"I thought that, but when someone like James Ducker is adamant that we're not interested in Otamendi and compared it to the Gaitan situation, it makes me think we're genuinely not interested."

reddevils,3dzus4,as520,2,Mon Jul 20 22:25:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I saw that but my impression regarding the ordeal is that Pedro is a plan B if ADM decides to hand in a transfer request and then leave for PSG, which he has yet to do if he really is intent on leaving. It seems from reports that LVG has been convincing ADM to stay. But what if he leaves? Hence Pedro talks."
reddevils,3dzus4,LomoSaltadoMontado,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:24 2015 UTC,"Yes but Blanc also said it will be a very difficult case because Di Maria plays for ""a big English club"" so IF the player wants to leave, you can assume many other clubs will be interested and it also seems to me they don't want to pay the money for Di Maria that Man United asks for. Pedro would be the cheaper solution."
reddevils,3dzus4,therosepetal,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:14:52 2015 UTC,"PSG and Bayern are only teams interested in Di Maria, but Bayern won't pay that much, we can hence rule them out. The only thing keeping PSG from getting Di Maria is us, we want that 75 million mark, that is what I believe. They could go for a plan B and it would be KdB, then Pedro, but both don't have that big name PSG are looking for, their project is to be on par with us, Barca, Real, Bayern, to be a global brand, that is why they are hell bent on buying a big name, and Di Maria is that in Europe currently, I hope, if he doesn't want to be here, we sell him for a price in the middle. Better for all the parties involved."

I cant see him playing for us again the problem though is whether he will accept the step down as hes obviously not ready for premiership football.

reddevils,3e0bah,rehanTCh,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:26:08 2015 UTC,He may not be fit from his injury yet as he hasn't been involved with the u21’s either but even fit and in favour I'm not sure he would have gone. I'm fairly sure his late join up with the squad on tour last season was a visa issue related to his DUI conviction. The US is fairly strict on these things and with any conviction you are usually required to go through an extended Visa application which takes much longer and usually needs an interview at the US embassy. There have been other players in the past at other clubs that had to miss US tours for convictions they have (Joey Barton was denied while at Newcastle I believe). The general rule I believe is you will be denied a visa until 5 years after your conviction and then only if you haven't got in any further trouble

reddevils,3dy8ks,BrendonAG92,81,Mon Jul 20 14:45:28 2015 UTC,Andreas Pereira - he's been on the bench and all so I'm sure he will play this season. Hopefully a good amount too.
reddevils,3dy8ks,Feezbull,21,Mon Jul 20 14:51:15 2015 UTC,Looked great on Friday
reddevils,3dy8ks,danc906,11,Mon Jul 20 15:12:50 2015 UTC,"I don't really see where he fits in LVG's 4-3-3.   He's too slow to play out wide and too lightweight, especially right now, to play centrally.  I don't think someone with his lack of pace is going to be successful in the PL on the wing in a 4-3-3 especially at 19 and LVG has shown a huge resistance to playing lightweight/flaky Attacking midfielders (Mata, Januzaj, Di Maria, Perreira) in one of the two CM roles, despite many fans wanting them to play there. So I very much doubt LVG is going to play him centrally.  If we assume then that LVG is going to try him in the wide role then he's still not as good as Januzaj yet who'll be first option in the 'giving a young player a game' role out wide.  I can't see a real place for Perreira in his system. The situation is quite a lot like Riquelme at Barcelona under LVG (obviously not suggesting Perreira has that kind of ability) in that he's too slow to play out wide and too lightweight/not good enough defensively to play in any of the central spots."
reddevils,3dy8ks,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:29:32 2015 UTC,"Good call actually. I was wondering that too myself but maybe, just maybe, with Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger in midfield, he could be playing that 3rd man in the midfield. In some of the games that allow for it.   He seems more keen to take a man on (and maybe better, not sure yet, than Adnan) than Mata for sure in that aspect so maybe as a similar role to Mata too at times for another slot, competing with januzaj.   Not sure how else he can play though otherwise."
reddevils,3dy8ks,Feezbull,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:39:30 2015 UTC,"Good call actually. I was wondering that too myself but maybe, just maybe, with Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger in midfield, he could be playing that 3rd man in the midfield. In some of the games that allow for it.   If that were true he'd have played Mata, Januzaj or Di Maria there last season alongside Herrera/Carrick, Carrick/Rooney, Blind/Herrera or Carrick/Fellaini but he showed absolutely extreme resistance to doing this including of course preferring to play Rooney there.  LVG just clearly doesn't like flaky, small frame players in his midfield three. No matter what injuries we had he just flat out refused to do it.  Can't see how he'd change that for Perreira who's even more lightweight than Di Maria or Mata.   He seems more keen to take a man on (and maybe better, not sure yet, than Adnan) than Mata for sure in that aspect so maybe as a similar role to Mata too at times for another slot, competing with januzaj. Not sure how else he can play though otherwise.   I didn't think Mata was much good in that wide role. Way too in and out of games, not on the ball often enough to make a consistent difference and when he did get the ball he was 20 yards from where he needed to be to do what he's good at (score goals, play 10 yards through balls). And he doesn't have the pace to carry the past inside to get into those positions (like Silva/Iniesta do so well).  I don't think it's impossible LVG gives Perreira a few games out wide, but I really, really don't see him playing well there at all at a Premier League level. I think any PL full back is going to get tight to him and probably kick him up and down and Perreira lacks the speed or strength to do anything about that."
reddevils,3dy8ks,JuanRiquelme,2,Mon Jul 20 16:48:25 2015 UTC,I really hope he gets some first team games this year. I feel like he could be the real deal.
reddevils,3dy8ks,hardgour,-9,Mon Jul 20 15:47:41 2015 UTC,Him over Pedro any day! The kid looks brilliant!
reddevils,3dy8ks,ibaRRaVzLa,4,Mon Jul 20 15:54:28 2015 UTC,Plus he has never been tested consistently in a big stage. Pedro has had some amazing years a really underrated player
reddevils,3dy8ks,Caesar3890,8,Mon Jul 20 16:27:07 2015 UTC,Ridiculous post isn't it? Pedro's 27 so probably in his prime and has scored around 100 goals in 300 games as a winger for Barcelona and this muppet would rather play a 19 year old with 2 senior appearances over him?
reddevils,3dy8ks,JuanRiquelme,2,Mon Jul 20 16:33:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe he just doesn't want Pedro to allow pereira to develop. But otherwise, there's no way I'd pick pereira if Pedro was in our squad. A very good goal record for a winger as well for that matter."

reddevils,3dy8ks,Caesar3890,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:42:34 2015 UTC,You're seriously underselling Pedro here. By a LOT. And then a lot more.
reddevils,3dy8ks,Feezbull,-1,Mon Jul 20 16:40:52 2015 UTC,Perreira's not even a winger he's a midfielder or number 10.  He's too slow to play out wide.
reddevils,3dy8ks,JuanRiquelme,32,Mon Jul 20 16:24:30 2015 UTC,"Worth remembering that Paddy/Tyler only got looks because of injuries. The squad is going to be deeper this year. I think Andreas, James Wilson, and Adnan will get some more time this year if not sent on loan."

reddevils,3dy8ks,khoazany,4,Mon Jul 20 17:21:20 2015 UTC,Pereira - He's a fantastic dribbler with good pace and he has the vision to do well as a 10/or a winger
reddevils,3dy8ks,freckleddemon,4,Mon Jul 20 16:36:29 2015 UTC,"Apart from the current ones already in the first team (McNair,Pereira,Lingard,etc) can't think of anyone who might break into the team this season with our current squad depth.Fosu-Mensah,Tuanzebe,Gribbin and Williams will have a good chance in 2-3 seasons.If we're lucky a RB might break into the team to replace Valencia when he becomes too old (Tyler Reid or maybe our new signing Mason Holgate).Mitchell and Rashford are other decent bets.That saying LVG tends to make some very odd decisions so it's better not to guess."
reddevils,3dy8ks,khoazany,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:49:26 2015 UTC,or maybe our new signing Mason Holgate    Is it a done deal?
reddevils,3dy8ks,HaroldGuy,2,Mon Jul 20 16:55:25 2015 UTC,No but can't see anything that might stop us.
reddevils,3dy8ks,GamerKurisu,6,Mon Jul 20 17:08:02 2015 UTC,"Thinking about youth players that went on tour LAST year included: Amos, Johnstone, James, Blackett, M. Keane, Lingard, W. Keane (and Zaha).  Amos and Johnstone were too far down the pecking order. James did ok but then we signed Rojo and Blind so was loaned. Blackett did ok and we had an injury crisis. M. Keane did meh and was sold. Lingard did well and started the season due to injuries. W. Keane barely played and was loaned out.  So the tour wasn't a great indication and looking back through last year we had Blackett, McNair, Januzaj, Pereira and Wilson (and Lingard) who through either injury crisis or their own merit broke through into the first team.  In all honesty I don't think we're going to see many, if any, new names this year. I think it's the year we see a lot more of those names we already know mentioned in the previous paragraph, Januzaj/Pereira/Wilson/Lingard/McNair. If I had to say anyone I would say a central midfielder, either Goss or Gribbin (I would say striker as, bar any new signings, it's probably the most likely position to have an injury crisis, but we don't seem to have any promising ones behind Wilson?)"
reddevils,3dy8ks,KGreig46,3,Mon Jul 20 15:37:25 2015 UTC,"Pereira potentially, I just feel Wilson won't, he's had his chances and isn't good enough."
reddevils,3dy8ks,GamerKurisu,4,Mon Jul 20 17:04:03 2015 UTC,He scored a brace on his debut as a sub! I think he's done pretty well for his limited chances
reddevils,3dy8ks,TrollingPope,2,Mon Jul 20 18:17:12 2015 UTC,"Regardless, he's had plenty of opportunities to break through and he hasn't had the head to do that, so far and of that there's no doubt."
reddevils,3dy8ks,jmoney0999,2,Mon Jul 20 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"Last season he was behind Rooney, Van Persie, and Falcao, in a season where our strikers had poor service. There's no way he's underperformed yet."

reddevils,3dy8ks,bosnian_red,2,Mon Jul 20 20:11:57 2015 UTC,"I personally feel like that he has to improve physically, but he already reminds me of a young Boateng (Bayern Munich, not the other one) and a younger version of Rudiger (VFB Stuttgart)."
reddevils,3dy8ks,bionicbar,3,Mon Jul 20 20:17:26 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but you're right, he'd have to DRASTICALLY improve phisically to be anywhere near the likes of Boateng. As of right now he's simply too lightweight. McNair on the other hand could very well be our ""Rio."" Great ball play center back that can move into the middle while still being comfortable on the ball. Not very many of our CB's can say that at the moment apart from maybe Rojo."
reddevils,3dy8ks,Feezbull,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:13:02 2015 UTC,"Pereira, without a doubt"
reddevils,3dy8ks,rdzzl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:33:26 2015 UTC,"Pereira for sure, Wilson maybe as a squad player (maybe more), and Januzaj obviously who I guess still counts, but other then that, not sure. Fosu-Mensah is highly rated but has a way to go yet, nobody else stuck out from the U21 as being good enough to eventually be a United first team player."
reddevils,3dy8ks,StannisJr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:31 2015 UTC,"Pereira aside none of the u21's have really made me think they could be destined for greatness, I guess Goss will get a chance on tour though and hopefully he'll do well. Gribbin, Tuanzebe, Fosu-Mensah seem to be the most highly rated youth prospects we have at the minute"
reddevils,3dy8ks,Feezbull,3,Mon Jul 20 15:01:35 2015 UTC,"I'm sure Goss is only brought for the experience. There's very, very little chance he plays when Blind is the third choice DM for us. Maybe even 4th if Morgan plays there instead when needed."
reddevils,3dy8ks,StannisJr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:17:09 2015 UTC,I reckon he'll get a few minutes should someone pick up a minor injury in the second half though.
reddevils,3dy8ks,Feezbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:15:06 2015 UTC,Maybe Goss will eventually be the successor to Carrick.
reddevils,3dy8ks,StannisJr,2,Mon Jul 20 15:52:54 2015 UTC,Bastian is already the successor actually. And Schneiderlin could be next in line as he develops his mental and reading aspects of the game to be even better.   He will need to compete with Blind in the near future if he keeps progressing first of course.
reddevils,3dy8ks,Feezbull,2,Mon Jul 20 16:42:59 2015 UTC,"I meant long-term successor, but ok. I don't see any midfield prospects breaking into that midfield for the time being, unless injuries etc."
reddevils,3dy8ks,StannisJr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was thinking a little longer term too but even then, I think Blind could be his competitor don't you think so?"
reddevils,3dy8ks,Feezbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:43:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure he has the pace or physicality tbh. I think for now he'll just be competing for LB, there is no way he gets into that midfield. I hope LVG isn't going to try him at CB either during the season, as he doesn't have the physicality etc for that role either. I think honestly he'll just be competing for LB and be a bench warmer for the time being."
reddevils,3dy8ks,chunkable,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:37 2015 UTC,Carrick doesn't have the pace at all too. Alonso doesn't either. Neither does Pirlo. Nor scholes before.   That role doesn't require too much pace actually but more of football intelligence as you read the game very well.

Van Gaal has taken strong decisions at Old Trafford this summer, including the sale of Robin van Persie and the decision to ditch Victor Valdes after just six months.  Robson believes that the Dutchman's ability to make strong decisions will stand the club in good stead for the future.  ""It's very similar to Sir Alex Ferguson. Louis van Gaal has been very successful in his career. He has been a bit ruthless with a few of his decisions lately and that is what good managers do,"" Robson told reporters.  ""At certain stages, managers have to make major decisions and sometimes people have to move on and the manager has got to change things the way he sees it. And that is what he is doing, that's part of his job - you have to be ruthless at stages.""  Man United are currently on a pre-season tour of the United States"

When you have keepers like De Gea and Van Der Sar you aren't going to be pushing for a starting spot.

So this Romero signing clearly shows that hasn't changed and due to that, he isn't suitable. Loyalties are great of course but sometimes you need a player who fits your needs more so instead.  Lindegaard doesn't look to have the best distribution around for one thing too. We should let him go so he can play elsewhere.   He won't start at top clubs but he could play for some good teams still."

reddevils,3dy811,FlashTheGash,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:46:43 2015 UTC,I wonder if there's any rules regarding Skybet and the way they speculate on SkySports news. Serious conflict of interest there and many see SkySports News as gospel when it comes to transfers.
reddevils,3dy811,buymepizza,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:37 2015 UTC,The Skybet thing was sold off so they have no relation to each other I believe.
reddevils,3dy811,superironthorman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:48:15 2015 UTC,"They retain 20% ownership (equity + dividends), a long branding agreement, direct payments based on profit as both part of the PURCHASE cost and part of the relationship as a whole.   Meanwhile they have added papers gossip to their news content, use ""SKY SOURCES"" a hell of a lot more than they used to (before gambling was a part of their product offering and before gambling advertisements were legally allowed to be shown in the UK) to report on rumours when previously they just stated when deals were done. Their sources are definitely still more reputable than tabloids but still.   It's not the biggest conspiracy in the world but it's definitely a huge conflict of interest imo"
reddevils,3dy811,buymepizza,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:57:02 2015 UTC,"I'd agree but I know there is legislation against it, and with the UKGC and IBAS as well as all the new legislation and compliance acts in the UK I think they'd be fucked if it was ever proven."
reddevils,3dy811,superironthorman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:58:51 2015 UTC,"They probably would be fucked if it was ever proven but it's very difficult to prove. Goldman Sachs handled the sale and the terms and conditions made public were very cloudy and contigent on a lot of future situations - but the only thing that's clear is the opposite of what you said as I've said - there is a strong relationship between the companies. Sky Sports don't advertise anyone else's prices on their apps, or during live news shows - only Sky Bet's. There are legal precedents between Sky and its journalists - such as journalists aren't allowed to bet or make financial gain from anything they uncover during their role - which protects Sky in a lot of ways, should a legal investigation into what I'm suggesting occur. However, the point is that Sky picks and chooses what content, what gossip to relay to the public from its journalists. It doesn't take a formal agreement between Sky and SkyBet to profit from this - SkyBet retained all senior execs in the takeover so there are long standing personal relationships there. It doesn't take anything whatsoever complicated in the slightest for them to receive information from an inside source at Sky on which bets to offer the best prices on etc. There is nothing illegal being done on the surface between the companies and both benefit from SkyBets continued success.   In terms of the legislation and compliance they, alongside Goldman Sachs they can throw serious £s making sure they are compliant with new legislation. They got Greece into the blood EU didn't they. No regulatory body can compete and why would they, it would give them such a headache in every sense of the word to delve into this further.   I'm not having a go at you btw I realise that was a bit of a rant  Ian Herbert wrote an article on this in 2013 and it always pops up now and again but it will never seriously gain traction in the media because they themselves clearly sell papers through extremely fake sources  http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/ian-herbert-sky-sports-reports-sky-bet-reacts--is-there-a-conflict-of-interest-8807662.html"

If you went through a British betting agency then Kane and Bales prices will be inflated as they are better known players. It's the same reason that you can never get very good odds for United (even in the Moyes season), more people are always going to be betting on the team they support."
reddevils,3dy811,superironthorman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:28:41 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say the odds are based on how popular the bet is exactly, that would imply that the general public have insider knowledge when the average punter is betting on exactly what the tabloids/Sky are telling them to bet on. Bookies drastically reduce the odds when a significant amount of money is bet in a short space of times - usually originating close to the geographical location of the player/club in question.   Bookies spend as much time/effort trying to find out what players are moving where, and they aren't reading the Daily Mail, that's for sure. But the tabloids fuel so much speculation over so many players that the bookies can make a fortune. Like u said, people are always going to bet on the team they support, which is why every single player under the sun is linked to United. In fact, any player linked to anyone will always incur a ""Manchester United are also interested in X"""

reddevils,3dx89g,MrDaebak,13,Mon Jul 20 13:03:21 2015 UTC,"If we do sign Otamendi, my guess is he'll be looking at starting alongside Smalling.  In that case he better not cost over 5.5M in the FPL or I'll have to ditch Rojo and go with Shaw instead."
reddevils,3dx89g,WadeRonney,10,Mon Jul 20 09:57:11 2015 UTC,Otamendi and Smalling are both right-footed. Doubt we'd see them paired together under LvG.
reddevils,3dx89g,Schneidsteiger,2,Mon Jul 20 10:11:24 2015 UTC,I'd be really annoyed if we dropped Smalling for Rojo purely because he's right footed.  Smalling was easily our best centre back last season.
reddevils,3dx89g,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:44 2015 UTC,"We'd be living dangerously in every game if Louis goes for an Otamendi-Rojo partnership. Both like to jump into tackles instead of holding their positions and shutting down the opposition. Otamendi also struggles against pace, and with the high line we play, both of them will have to be extra sharp to avoid leaking goals."
reddevils,3dx89g,Schneidsteiger,4,Mon Jul 20 17:55:28 2015 UTC,Otamendi plays LCB at Valencia
reddevils,3dx89g,januzaj_44,16,Mon Jul 20 10:50:52 2015 UTC,But Valencia aren't managed by a trainer-coach who likes his CB pairing to be of one right-footed and one left-footed defender.
reddevils,3dx89g,Schneidsteiger,7,Mon Jul 20 11:09:35 2015 UTC,"always been curious of this, does it really matter  to Van Gaal that his players are the right ""footedness"" ? if so why? what led to him specifying that?"
reddevils,3dx89g,kingkongjaffa,17,Mon Jul 20 12:08:47 2015 UTC,To bring balance to the force.
reddevils,3dx89g,Resinderate,-2,Mon Jul 20 12:16:01 2015 UTC,"Force*   Psh, what is this, amateur hour?"
reddevils,3dx89g,MyWholeTeamsDead,2,Mon Jul 20 13:23:23 2015 UTC,RCB would then pass better with his right foot and hence make build up plays and all a little easier. Less chances of error in passing and being on the wrong foot under pressure.
reddevils,3dx89g,Feezbull,2,Mon Jul 20 12:16:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's obvious, what I mean is, is there some sequence of play that he prefers like rcb gets ball passes on his outside foot to the rb or passes on his inside safely to his lcb or to his dm (whatever foot he wants) etc. is there some logical build up that really needs to show everyone onto their stronger foot? Or is it just a peculiarity about how he sets up his defenders?"
reddevils,3dx89g,kingkongjaffa,4,Mon Jul 20 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"If you are a correct footed (left footed LCB, right footed RB) CB and you have been passed a ball from an under pressure fullback with your body facing up the pitch, you can clear the ball in any direction. Without adjusting your body, as a wrong footed CB you can only hit it towards the sideline unless you wait a few extra seconds for the ball to pass your whole body.  Likewise, as a CB under pressure facing goal, as a correctly footed CB, you can pass it to a FB, the keeper or boot it out for a throw in, as a wrong footed CB you can only pass it across the goalmouth, or at a keeper who will no doubt be swearing his tits off at you.  Mostly it's positioning to be fair though, there are obviously more right footed players then left footed players, and if you've played as a right footed LCB often, you'll be used to this and will adjust your positioning accordingly."
reddevils,3dx89g,Sl1pp3ryNinja,2,Mon Jul 20 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"nice one cheers, this is the sort of interpretation I was after!"
reddevils,3dx89g,kingkongjaffa,2,Mon Jul 20 16:36:09 2015 UTC,It definitely does matter to him.  I have absolutely no idea why. There's endless examples of phenomenal centre backs playing on the 'wrong' side and that includes players who are brilliant on the ball.  It's very bizarre the obsession he has with it.
reddevils,3dx89g,JuanRiquelme,2,Mon Jul 20 16:38:02 2015 UTC,"Better watch out, youre about to get dropped and sold to Fenerbahce."
reddevils,3dx89g,ThatBoyGiggsy,6,Mon Jul 20 19:21:05 2015 UTC,He wouldn't drop one of them if they're good enough though. That's a preference and not an absolute rule. No way he'd start rojo instead of Smalling if the latter is much better and Otamendi shows top class defending as well.
reddevils,3dx89g,Feezbull,2,Mon Jul 20 12:16:03 2015 UTC,"I'd like to believe so too, considering an Otamendi-Rojo pairing would be too eager in its tackling and not the most complementary. But having seen how Louis focuses on every little detail, I wouldn't be too surprised if he initially experiments with a right-left footer partnership."
reddevils,3dx89g,Schneidsteiger,2,Mon Jul 20 13:20:46 2015 UTC,He did it quite a few times last season where he'd start Blackett because he's left footed when a better (i.e any of our other centre backs) right footed centre back was available.
reddevils,3dx89g,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:39:47 2015 UTC,"I think that was initially though as he saw promise in Tyler but eventually, he picked the better defenders instead just as we saw Evans as well got dropped even when fit.   So this time I doubt he would experiment anymore in that aspect as he's already seen them and knows how they play etc. he still might but it wouldn't make sense to drop Otamendi nor Smalling just for that and based off form that we've seen from Smalling. Rojo could displace him of course but it's unknown as of now perhaps?"
reddevils,3dx89g,Feezbull,5,Mon Jul 20 16:45:37 2015 UTC,Van Gaal played Jones at LCB over Rojo at the end of the season plenty of times
reddevils,3dx89g,januzaj_44,3,Mon Jul 20 12:29:57 2015 UTC,"That's why I don't understand when the majority of people have Jones as the back up in all of these potential lineups threads. I thought Jones player better than Rojo last season, it's only his injuries that worry me. It was Rojo's first season last year though, so I'll be happy if he does perform as well as people think he will on here."
reddevils,3dx89g,aallmark,2,Mon Jul 20 17:38:51 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, the post-red card Smalling was our best defender last season, followed by Rojo. Jones seems to have stalled in his growth and I can't figure out if it's all the injuries or the constant tinkering with the backline. He's trapped in a vicious cycle where his poor awareness and decision-making lead to physical overcompensation and injuries, which in turn stalls his development."
reddevils,3dx89g,Schneidsteiger,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:04:49 2015 UTC,"I think he needs a good run of games so that he can establish himself in the first team. the same can be said for Rojo as well, but I just think that Jones has more potential."
reddevils,3dx89g,aallmark,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:21:35 2015 UTC,Just because he has a preference doesn't mean that's what he'll play should Otamendi come in. Him and Smalling would undoubtedly be the strongest pairing
reddevils,3dx89g,KanesNipples,-1,Mon Jul 20 12:44:37 2015 UTC,"Don't worry guys, Van Gaal also knows how to play with 5 defenders. He can go to 3-4-3, 5-3-2, 5-2-3. With Depay as striker or winger for the counter. In the back you'll have Shaw, Blind/Rojo, Otamendi, Smalling, Darmian."
reddevils,3dx89g,MrDaebak,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:18:09 2015 UTC,"Shame. After his red, Smalling has been a revelation. As did Rojo before his injuries. Was kinda hoping to see them together for a few games although deep down, we all know they (most probably) might not cut it against the ""top top"" teams.  Not to mention, injuries to either one and we're back in the pooper."
reddevils,3dx89g,WadeRonney,3,Mon Jul 20 10:18:55 2015 UTC,Shaw - Otamendi - Rojo - Darmien  I can surely get used to that

reddevils,3dx89g,Shrimpeh007,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:03:26 2015 UTC,"Why do people want Pedro AND Di Maria, totally unneeded IMO, Van Gaal has already said he wants to strengthen a couple more positions i doubt the wing is one of them (unless Di Maria leaves)  Assuming everyone is fit, Di Maria will likely play on the wing so if we had Pedro aswell then their would be no place for him.  On the left we have Depay/Di Maria/Young/Januzaj  On the right we have Di Maria/Mata/Depay/Young/Valencia/Januzaj  Now if everyone is fit i expect Depay to line up on the left and Di Maria to line up on the right (he was played there quite a bit last season), with Mata rotating in and out. Even if Di Maria is picked in centre midfield and people think because of that we need more quality on the right then you're basically saying goodbye to Mata if we sign Pedro, is Pedro better than Mata on the right? Of course he is but as a fan of Mata and knowing that Di Maria will probably play more games on the wing i honestly don't see the point in signing Pedro."
reddevils,3dx89g,markob53,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"Why would people want Pedro? First of all, he would be the best winger at United, behind Di Maria. He's pretty cheap and he's 27. He has quite a few years in him and if he performs like you expect of him, then he'll be worth it for that fee plus his wages. He'll ask for a lot maybe, but nothing insane.   Thing is, Di Maria hasn't shown he's the best yet. Who knows if he will next year? I think he will, but he might not. If he plays like he did last year, Pedro might actually be the best winger at United. Then there's Depay and Young. The other two wingers. That would make it 4 wingers. In most games, a winger will be subbed. They could easily rotate Depay, Pedro and Di Maria and they'd all get loads of minutes. Some disagree, but I think that Pedro works well on either wing and he's really good with both feet. After Young's good season last year, it's a bit sad if he never plays anymore. I'm sure he will still find minutes but I honestly think it's to move on from him. He and Fellaini never were United level and even though they played really well, they're around the quality you'd find a team going for fourth. Not for first place. Pedro clearly is. Di Maria should be. Depay is going to be. Young is a great fourth choice then. Then you get all the youngsters like Januzaj and Pereira. They'll fill in the gaps. Games against Norwich and League Cup games. Plus injuries and substitutions. They'll get their minutes somewhere.   I don't know where Mata fits in to this honestly. He should play in my opinion. Maybe they'll play a 4-3-3 where he is in midfield with Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin. The midfield is honestly stacked. Too many good players with Mata, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, Herrera, Carrick and then you have Blind and Fellaini. I don't think the last two will play much. The others will rotate and especially Carrick and Schweinsteiger might not play all that much because of injuries and such.   Most of it will be based on form and who plays well. I think getting Pedro is a good decision. Can't go wrong with having more depth."

Who she is? Look at this sweet cross. The goal is at 120' became the latest goal in Fifa history. The US team tied with Brazil then won on penalty kicks.
reddevils,3dvvzc,azntitanik,4,Mon Jul 20 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but then after we beat France in the semifinal, we choked in the final...  I would still be so sad about 2011 if not for this year's Cup."

I watched some runs of Krieger and JJ the other day, man they were twice faster than the Japan players"
reddevils,3dvvzc,NAFI_S,2,Mon Jul 20 01:23:17 2015 UTC,"True, but it's still heartbreaking to think about. I've been a fan of the USWNT since I was 9 years old when I attended the Final of the 1999 WWC, so needless to say seeing them lose like that was painful. It was nice to see them get redemption at the 2012 Olympics and this year, but I'd rather have four stars than three."
reddevils,3dvvzc,TheKevinShow,3,Mon Jul 20 01:43:43 2015 UTC,"I would still be so sad   US women has won it three times already in its short history, I think you'll survive. Your women's team and your culture for women's football is on another level compared to the rest of the world."

reddevils,3dvvzc,shredderrrrrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:00:12 2015 UTC,"Hell, I would sign her to United. She is fucking good. She is one of the only female players I've seen where I legitimately think she looks on par with professional mens players.   If only the EPL allowed the baseball equivalent of pinch-hitters for corners where we could send her in to cross the ball for us. She plays some of the best crosses I've seen--which a team with as shitty of corners as ours, we could sure use.   And here is a video of that cross (since I don't think the .gif did it justice)."

I think people might have taken my comment to be saying that I think she could honestly step in and play on Manchester United. I obviously don't think a female player (much less one as tiny as her) could handle the physicality of the EPL. I was just saying she has the skills to play on a team like ours. Her vision, touch, and passing is incredible. I love watching her play."
reddevils,3dvvzc,TweetsInCommentsBot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:02:36 2015 UTC,"She'd get destroyed in a men's league, mate.  And if we had 'pitch-hitters' or whatever, you'd just get Beckham outta retirement and he'd be able to do that for another ten-years."
reddevils,3dvvzc,azntitanik,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:14:25 2015 UTC,"Right after I typed that, I wondered if I should have made it more clear that I didn't honestly think she'd be able to play in the EPL (and that I was being largely hyperbolic). Obviously I don't think Rapinoe could come survive playing against Stoke or whatever.   Due to the nature of the game, I don't think any female could realistically play in the EPL (or any top mens league). The physicality differential is just way too big. Even a tough and relatively quick player like Rapinoe is no different. What I was trying to get at is that she has the qualities that seem to be so lacking in so many other female players. Put differently, most female soccer players couldn't cut it in the EPL because they couldn't compete physically and they lack the skills. Rapinoe has the latter. Put Rapinoe in a man's body and she would be able to play on teams like United. Put 99% of the other female soccer players in male bodies and they still wouldn't be EPL quality."

He said it felt like ""aliens were abducting him"". keep in mind also UFC fighters take a lot of shots to the head even when sparring, it all adds up to thousands of hits in the head over the course of a career."

MMA fighters often get serious hits in the head and continue the fight, which is ridiculously dangerous. I'm not familiar enough with the topic to get into details but Joe Rogan discussed it with Rhonda Patrick on his podcast some months ago. I believe it was this episode if you're interested."

reddevils,3dwpfx,xtfftc,4,Mon Jul 20 10:26:50 2015 UTC,What's funny is people don't make much of a fuss about boxing and that sport is literally 2 dudes punching each other in the head until one of them is so concussed that they can't stand up anymore.
reddevils,3dwpfx,Feezbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:02:04 2015 UTC,"I think many of the points raised about American Football are valid, and since it's widely accepted and played with protective gear and whatnot, the issues are sort of ignored. While in boxing and MMA and other fight sports, the fighting bit is obvious.   Still, there's a lot of hypocrisy as well."
reddevils,3dwpfx,erelim,3,Mon Jul 20 09:07:37 2015 UTC,I don't get why the head issues are any different to rugby without helmets nor any pads too. And the scrum is easily something you can break your neck in as well which is a lot worse than a tackle in American football in my opinion.

reddevils,3dwpfx,NAFI_S,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:34:59 2015 UTC,"In Rugby, because you aren't wearing any pads, you are forced to tackle in a very specific way to not injure yourself. In American Football I guess you can chuck yourself at the opponent any way you want within the laws of the game. You still get big hits in Rugby of course, it's by no means safe."

There's definitely similarities and I'm sure they can communicate a little using those two languages, but if they know a little English, it would be far more convenient to use that instead. If Darmian never learned any Spanish a lot of stuff will be different. He'll understand when they talk about ""chicas"", but in Italian that's ""ragazzas"". Far too much difference between a lot of things. His general knowledge and his English skills will provide far more uses than his Italian will do."

reddevils,3dx845,Panda12341234,-1,Mon Jul 20 10:53:39 2015 UTC,Navas got the #1 shirt....  I think ddg will stay
reddevils,3dx845,YoungJump,11,Mon Jul 20 07:56:06 2015 UTC,I'd imagine Sergio Romero is replacing Valdes. Van Gaal worked with him before at AZ so I trust he knows what he's doing
reddevils,3dx845,BallsX,2,Mon Jul 20 07:57:21 2015 UTC,Its quite likely that he's staying for this year and leaving on a free next year. Its sad that we will be getting nothing for a top 3 keeper in the world but there's nothing we can do when the player wants to return to his country.
reddevils,3dx845,Feezbull,0,Mon Jul 20 08:19:30 2015 UTC,Well we could do something- we could sell him.
reddevils,3dx845,BallsX,3,Mon Jul 20 08:38:54 2015 UTC,"I agree with the majority in saying that its better that we keep him for the year instead of selling him for a paltry 13m pounds (the last reported sum, I may be wrong though).  The only way I'd actually be happy if we sell him this window is if we get Ramos in exchange or if we get a top keeper immediately. There arent many top keepers available that I know of though."
reddevils,3dx845,Feezbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:47:19 2015 UTC,If we sell him of course we would find someone else immediately I'm guessing. No way we won't. There's Leno who's available. There's Lloris at a punt. There's Oblak. Quite a few options there actually.
reddevils,3dx845,WhatAreThooose,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:04:30 2015 UTC,But the question is will they be available at a reasonable price. Im sure the respective clubs of the keepers mentioned know that we're desperate for keepers so will up their asking price
reddevils,3dx845,Feezbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:12:36 2015 UTC,Of course it won't be easy but we just have to pay up if so as time won't be on our side. I'm sure Leno or Oblak would be keen on joining though.
reddevils,3dx845,WhatAreThooose,0,Mon Jul 20 10:17:42 2015 UTC,Yes both are young and very talented. Would be a bargain if we swoop one of them in for under £20m
reddevils,3dx845,BallsX,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:01:55 2015 UTC,I know its not my money but Lloris is going to cost a fortune and I can say with all certainty that it will be a year long saga if we actually do try for him.  I keep seeing Lenos name but I cannot comment on him as ive not watched him (or dont recall anything about him).  Oblak has only just joined AM and I dont see him leaving so soon.  I don't think its going to be very easy to find a replacement if DDG leaves this year.
reddevils,3dx845,Feezbull,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:17:27 2015 UTC,It means nothing. They can still sign de gea if things work out and just sell Navas. There's no rule about having to keep or play Navas.
reddevils,3dx845,Panda12341234,0,Mon Jul 20 08:05:02 2015 UTC,"And they bought another keeper  So that equals navas #1, new keeper, and ddg?  That's lot of goal keepers"
reddevils,3dx845,Feezbull,2,Mon Jul 20 08:18:33 2015 UTC,Sell Navas as I said earlier. It's really not that hard.
reddevils,3dx845,Panda12341234,0,Mon Jul 20 08:36:32 2015 UTC,But they won't sell navas until the have got ddg...  And i doubt they will buy ddg ... Without the sale of Ramos..  .
reddevils,3dx845,Feezbull,3,Mon Jul 20 08:57:50 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is if de gea goes, they will sell Navas. That's all. It's not hard for them."

If Rooney performs similarly then we're really hoping that Depay and Pedro, should he come, chip in with something like 10 goals each.  Also, a lot of people talk about leaving Mata out the side but he is a  consistent goalscorer. 10 last season and a few of them were crucial. Whatever the drawbacks in his game are, he gets goals."

reddevils,3dvir8,GGMU1992,6,Sun Jul 19 23:03:26 2015 UTC,"Rooney had arguably his best season for United when playing up top on his own. This is exactly where Mourinho wanted to play him when they were trying to buy him before they got Costa. It's only because he's versatile that he's been shifted about, now that we actually have proper midfielders for the right roles and we've got rid of 2 strikers he can be the main man up top again. If he gets good service from the wings and people moving around him he will bang in a good number this season."
reddevils,3dvir8,adguig,4,Mon Jul 20 01:05:25 2015 UTC,I wonder if rooney will be enough at st there's a reason we bought rvp because its impossible for him to go a full season without huge dips when hes up top
reddevils,3dvir8,danskzwag,3,Sun Jul 19 22:30:37 2015 UTC,"When RvP was bought, we were playing with two strikers. I'm not saying United shouldn't buy a new striker, but the situation was very different. As it is right now, you have Rooney, Hernandez and Wilson fighting for 1 spot. Depay can play there as well. I wouldn't be too worried if LvG stuck with what he has."
reddevils,3dvir8,ChristianKrell,3,Mon Jul 20 09:39:06 2015 UTC,This. I'd be quite concerned if we don't sign a striker.

reddevils,3dvir8,Ronin_Dizz88,2,Sun Jul 19 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"He'll probably be alright in a 4-3-3, with players feeding him. I still think he can perform well, just not on the level of 20+ goals."
reddevils,3dvir8,Nice-MayMay,9,Sun Jul 19 22:14:11 2015 UTC,I'd be willing to have a wager that Rooney is going to score 20+ goals barring major injuries if he plays striker
reddevils,3dvir8,reddevilsruled08,2,Sun Jul 19 23:59:26 2015 UTC,We talking in the league only? If that's all competitions that like on average 2 goals a month. Aguero/Costa missed loads of the season yet still managed that in the league alone.
reddevils,3dvir8,mink_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:28:32 2015 UTC,"If he's going to be our main striker then I'd be very worried if he doesn't score a minimum of 20 goals!  I think its a risk to go into the season with only Rooney, Hernandez and Wilson.If Rooney were to get injured are we really going to rely on Hernandez for a few games in a row?   Dont get me  wrong, i love Hernandez but he has always seemed like a fantastic supersub and an average starter because of the way he plays."
reddevils,3dvir8,BallsX,3,Mon Jul 20 07:51:17 2015 UTC,I could easily see him scoring 20+ as the main man up top all season. United will be a well oiled machine come the start of the season. LvG will have a much stronger squad who understand his playing style. We'll perform much better than last season.

reddevils,3dwqgb,aravindu43,39,Mon Jul 20 04:15:03 2015 UTC,"I see his future less in midfield (unless injuries) and more as the batteringram macguyver'd CF in lieu of Rooney. Memphis has been touted as this, but in all likelihood Fellaini will be the one brought into that role to kill games off and give Rooney a rest; or initiate the dreaded Belgian Route 1 ball tactic."
reddevils,3dwqgb,MylesVE,6,Mon Jul 20 04:51:51 2015 UTC,This. I can see if we're getting pushed about by the strong smaller teams like Stoke he could play just behind Rooney as a plan B CF. He's a midfielder who is much more suited as a target man
reddevils,3dwqgb,TMillo,4,Mon Jul 20 08:32:08 2015 UTC,I can even see LVG maybe pushing him to a false 9 if rooney can't play and chicha is struggling for whatever reason.

reddevils,3dwqgb,DVio,49,Mon Jul 20 05:32:45 2015 UTC,i think we will be having a different approach to the game this season where there is less emphasis on the physical approach and more on possession football.   we didn't have a choice last season. fellaini will always be option B in my opinion
reddevils,3dwqgb,staticxtreme,56,Mon Jul 20 04:50:35 2015 UTC,"The English game requires a variety of approaches. Opposition teams will be physical, they will park the bus and they will try to kill off games. Fellaini higher up the pitch creates chaos, he has bite and his strength and height gives us a massive advantage, he is a valuable member of the team and no where near as bad as the media have made him out to be. He will continue to play an important role."
reddevils,3dwqgb,mynjo,7,Mon Jul 20 05:24:23 2015 UTC,"totally agree. he creates indefinite amount of chaos and it's great for PL. On the flipside LvG's method and philosophy is not to create chaos  but to create via possession and quick passing through diagonal plays.   we'll see how it pans out, my gut feeling is he will be option B given our signings and his initial suspension."
reddevils,3dwqgb,staticxtreme,2,Mon Jul 20 08:02:25 2015 UTC,"I agree as well. I don't like crosses into Fella to be ""Plan A"" but it's a nice alternative to have in certain situations. He does create chaos. Plus he proved last year that he isn't just a head in the box. He can bring the ball down softly, lay it off and also strike with power and accuracy."
reddevils,3dwqgb,osorojotx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:52:53 2015 UTC,Plus now more plans are needed for the Champions League so I'm sure our squad will be rotated and played in many forms this season
reddevils,3dwqgb,mufc804,5,Mon Jul 20 14:47:54 2015 UTC,Fellaini isn't just a big brute to be used as a battering ram though. He literally has the best chest control in the world and he's amazing at taking the ball down and making a short pass to another player in very tight spaces. I think he fits LVG's possession first philosophy quite well and he also consistently scores when played further up.
reddevils,3dwqgb,SyndeyC,5,Mon Jul 20 13:50:37 2015 UTC,I think that with all the different competitions and the physicality of the Premier League he will play a very important role.

reddevils,3dwqgb,DangoManUtd,3,Mon Jul 20 10:24:30 2015 UTC,"I think the 3 match ban is a massive negative for him at the beginning of the season, as it gives Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger a chance to cement their positions. I see it as being 2 of 4 out of Schneiderlin, Carrick, Schweinsteiger and Fellaini... or if he's being played further up the pitch then he's competing for one position with Mata and Herrera."
reddevils,3dwqgb,craigybacha,2,Mon Jul 20 11:24:25 2015 UTC,"I basically see him being used this season as more of a 'we're losing after 70 minutes, put Fellaini on and hoof it up to him' type strategy."
reddevils,3dwqgb,craigybacha,2,Mon Jul 20 11:25:01 2015 UTC,He will be a bench player till he shows a really good performance either in training or when he comes off the bench. He still has a future at this club. He had a good season last year especially after than west brom goal.

reddevils,3dwqgb,xtfftc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:48:25 2015 UTC,I think Fellaini is going to be our plan B and will be a sub for the majority of the season. With our new and fantastic midfield additions we arent going to play with 2 strikers and our wingers  will have to contribute big time. Fellaini has shown that he can do it as a second striker or a no.10 but its more than likely that LVG plays him when we need a big presence up front or when we need to run down the clock.

reddevils,3dvj90,Jhix,24,Sun Jul 19 21:58:55 2015 UTC,Its a set time within the English press (I dunno if its the rules or just some kind of gentlemans agreement)  Whenever the press get to have a behind closed door interview (like the second half of the managers press conferences) they embargo the news until 11pm so that each journalist has time to get his own story written.

Di Maria    Rooney     Mata   and   Young       Pedro      Depay   Is that too much depth? I'm pretty sure Di Maria will go if we get Pedro though.
reddevils,3dvj90,jammybear,5,Sun Jul 19 22:00:51 2015 UTC,"Pedro will be specifically coming in for the wide right position  Depthwise it will be   Di Maria/Young/Depay---------Rooney/Wilson/Hernandez-------Pedro/Mata/Valencia/Januzaj  Which is why I think Adnan is going on loan somewhere and we are gearing up to sell Di Maria. He isnt going to be happy playing second fiddle to the likes of Young, Depay, Pedro and Mata."
reddevils,3dvj90,Creamy_Goodne55,18,Sun Jul 19 22:07:27 2015 UTC,I don't understand why a lot of us think Di Maria would play second fiddle to Memphis. Di Maria is on another level compared to Memphis and really any of our wide players.
reddevils,3dvj90,DJkoolkidzklan,2,Mon Jul 20 00:34:31 2015 UTC,In reality Di maria is our best winger.

Don't think Valencia will be used at RF either, it seems LVG prefers inverted wingers who can cut inside in his 433. He hasn't played valencia there once to be fair.   I'd agree, If we get Pedro I just can't see Di Maria staying, it seems far too much."
reddevils,3dvj90,jammybear,3,Sun Jul 19 22:11:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, Pedro should definitely only be bought if Di Maria leaves.  We have 4 potentially players - Di Maria/Memphis/Young/Mata capable of being >40 game per season players as well as Janzuaj and Pereira who will most likely both be 3rd choice for either wing.    Di Maria struggled for starts last season, Januzaj and Pereira barely played at all and now we've bought Memphis.  We'd be stupid to loan Januzaj or Pereira too, they both have a role to play in the squad and probably wouldn't take too kindly to being loaned out.  Ben Pearson, Joe Rothwell etc. are the only level players I think we'll see loaned."

I think Januzaj had way to much pressure put on him, and if he really did bulk up and calms his head, he has a lot of potential. I was genuinely impressed with Pereira's ability to beat a man and put in a beautiful cross against Club America, but hopefully we'll see if he can pull it off against Prem teams.   Honestly, I would still very much like to have Pedro and keep Di Maria. I mean, the scenario is possible but yeah, I see why that might not be good."
reddevils,3dvj90,UncookedGnome,4,Mon Jul 20 17:28:38 2015 UTC,Valencia will fill in for depth at rightback. I don't see him playing winger especially after Van Gaal called him a defender during the recent press conference.

reddevils,3dvj90,KlausJanVanWolfhaus,5,Tue Jul 21 01:37:15 2015 UTC,"Louis van Gaal has accepted that he diminishes the England captain's goalscoring talents by deploying him in midfield, writes Mark Ogden  Wayne Rooney will be restored to a central striking role at Manchester United this season with Louis van Gaal, the manager,  accepting that he diminishes the England captain’s goalscoring talents by deploying him in midfield.  Rooney, 29, is United’s only fit and experienced forward following the sale of the Holland international Robin van Persie to Fenerbahce and Van Gaal’s decision not to sign Radamel Falcao on a permanent contract at the end of his unsuccessful year on loan from Monaco last season.  Van Persie, who completed a £4.8 million move to Turkey last week, has claimed that he wanted another chance to return to favour at United, only to be told to train with the reserves by Van Gaal.  “I know Louis as a national team coach and now I get to know him as a club coach,” Van Persie said. “And there is a difference. It wasn’t an honest battle any more. Fighting to get back in the team wasn’t given me as an option. You have to make the best out of any situation so I’m doing this by moving on.”  Despite the risk of relying on Rooney to stay fit and deliver at least 20 goals this season, Van Gaal has told Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, that he is prepared to go into the new campaign without adding a centre-forward to his squad.  Van Gaal is keen to pursue a deal for the Barcelona forward Pedro, who can operate on the right of an attacking three as well as through the centre, with the 27-year-old available for a fee of £22 million as a result of his escape clause at the Nou Camp.  United are poised to battle it out with Chelsea to sign the Spain international, who has told friends that he favours a move to Old Trafford, but Van Gaal believes that Rooney remains capable of producing the form that has taken the England captain to within 19 goals of equalling Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time goalscoring record.  Rooney’s haul last season of 14 goals in all competitions was his lowest return for United since his £27 million move from Everton in August 2004.  However, Van Gaal has admitted to Rooney that he blunted his threat last season by asking him to play as a makeshift midfielder due to injuries to the likes of Michael Carrick and Daley Blind. The Dutch manager believes that the game’s leading strikers are all performing for powerful Euro­pean clubs, making it hugely difficult for the manager to improve his attacking options as a result. Van Gaal has identified Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski and Paris St-Germain’s Edinson Cavani as leading targets, but neither player will be sold this summer.  Beneath that level, United have watched Lazio’s Felipe Anderson and Lyon’s Alexandre Lacazette, but Van Gaal believes that Rooney still belongs in the top echelon of goalscorers and has told Woodward that he does not wish to add a centre-forward who is not of the same calibre.  With Van Gaal planning to deploy a 4-3-3 formation this season, with Rooney as his central striker, Pedro is regarded as a solution to the right-sided position, with Ashley Young, Ãngel di María and the summer signing Memphis Depay all able to play on the left or right. United, who defeated Club America in Seattle in the opening game of their pre-season tour on Saturday, travel to California on Monday to face San Jose Earthquakes on Tuesday."
reddevils,3dvj90,s1fsw,3,Mon Jul 20 04:44:08 2015 UTC,Good. Always bothered me having 2 strikers. They were always pushing the back four instead of coming down to be more involved in the build up.

reddevils,3dvj90,huey88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:16:30 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be so certain. Shaw needs to improve his positioning to start ahead of Blind. He was getting caught out going forward last season and United looked better with Blind at left-back.
reddevils,3dvj90,WillyMorganOnTheWing,2,Mon Jul 20 15:40:09 2015 UTC,I just don't believe we looked better with blind at LB not with shaw having the speed and everything else you want and being young. His problem was he couldn't stay healthy/fit last year.
reddevils,3dvj90,huey88,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:41:58 2015 UTC,I think United were far better in possession and less vulnerable to counter attacks.

reddevils,3dvj90,Creamy_Goodne55,-4,Sun Jul 19 22:05:07 2015 UTC,"""Wayne Rooney will be restored to a central striking role at Manchester United this season with Louis van Gaal, the manager, accepting that he diminishes the England captain’s goalscoring talents by deploying him in midfield.""  Pity little man Ogden. LvG used WR on midfield because he had in Falcao and RvP two other possibly great strikers. He tried to fit them in all and WR was the one who's most versatile and able to drop a line.    Having to twist facts or making them up, any opportunity to make somebody look like a failure will be taken. But oh boy when a player like Bale get's poorly treated by Madrid fans and Spanish press this same mr. Ogden screams blue murder."

reddevils,3dvrjx,TheJoshider10,17,Sun Jul 19 23:23:29 2015 UTC,"I am too, but I do think it's only happening if we sell ADM, which, no matter how bad he was last season, I don't want to happen, but it's looking more and more likely these days."

When you have a player who could fit the system so well for so cheap, you can't exactly not go for it.

reddevils,3dvrjx,TheJoshider10,8,Mon Jul 20 01:03:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Pedro is a striker option but isn't limited to it, so he doesn't have to just play second fiddle to Rooney and can play on the wing as a starter or a sub. Honestly, it's a win-win. I also respect that Pedro has been willing to ride the bench in Barca for so long."
reddevils,3dvrjx,UncookedGnome,6,Mon Jul 20 02:43:56 2015 UTC,"I still don't know if this entire story is just tabloid bullshit or not. Barca have Neymar, Suarez, Messi as their attacking three in a 4-3-3, but Pedro is a plug-in replacement for any of those 3, and with Barca under a transfer ban for this window, I'm not sure why they'd sell Pedro, especially for the 18m pounds being quoted  That being said, if he is available, and that's the price, I'd love to have him here at the club"
reddevils,3dvrjx,Worst_smurf_NA,0,Mon Jul 20 02:45:48 2015 UTC,"Well if it's a release clause they have no choice, and then it's down to the player, who'll probably like the chance to be a big player for a club after seeing what has happened to Sanchez."
reddevils,3dvrjx,TheJoshider10,2,Mon Jul 20 02:52:29 2015 UTC,"Release clauses in Spain don't function the same way. They offer the player the option to buyout his contract, but that money is taxable, it means you end up paying more than the clause. Usually clubs will just negotiate a fee to avoid the tax issues."
reddevils,3dvrjx,jacksteroo18,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:33:45 2015 UTC,"Well his release clause did go down from 112 million because he didn't start enough games, so I imagine if he thinks he will have a chance at getting more time here, he'd join."

Biggest downside might be that the price could be quite high."
reddevils,3dvrjx,broman13,3,Sun Jul 19 23:57:24 2015 UTC,I want to buy him now so that he's relatively cheap because I think if we try in a couple seasons it will require an absurd fee. He looks class

Maybe long term Vidal is the better option, but I'm not convinced that Schweinsteiger is on his last legs at all, in fact I'm pretty sure he has some fantastic years left in the tank. If we were going to pop our German cherry, I think only Muller or Boateng would've been a better option than him.   It's just so cool to see another legend at the club, just as we will be talking about Scholes, Giggs, etc. for years to come, I think that's how Bayern fans will talk about Schweini, except we get him as well!   I can see why you'd rather have Vidal, he's younger and has much of the same skill sets as Schweinsteiger. Had a couple injuries in the past but so has Schweini. I think in the end, the leadership and experience he'll bring to the team will cancel out any concerns we might have over his age.    Edit- I'll also say that while I'm not super concerned with our players' personal lives, Vidal's DUI accident this summer (and the quotes of him talking to policemen at the scene) left a really bad taste in my mouth. I get that we've had morally questionable players in the past, but it's just another factor that makes me lean toward Schweinsteiger rather than Vidal."

reddevils,3dvrjx,ohyou123,7,Mon Jul 20 07:04:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Bayern don't piss about when it comes to transfers. They were quick to find a replacement but I worry about Vidal's past injuries even though they got him for buttons, 35m.   I will say this. Vidal is far more dynamic than Schweinsteiger. He'll gun it for goal whereas Bastian will control the midfield. We haven't had any leadership in the middle of the field since Keane left. Bastian will command the area. We've enough attack minded-midfielders."

Given the amount of games this season - should we give up? Is there an opaque goal to have a first 11 or is it obsolete in the modern game?   3) Question for Rooney - Putting aside results, putting aside footballing quality, how has the transformation of the last 2 seasons affected the culture of the dressing room? How have you as captain and the remaining long-standing players maintained the identity of Manchester United in that dressing room despite losing cumulative decades worth of experience/culture/personality?

reddevils,3dupzt,rdzzl,5,Mon Jul 20 02:49:40 2015 UTC,"Dear Louis,   when are you going to explain to the british press that when we play 4-3-3 based on the dutch total football ideology, as your philosophy is, one doesn't play the midfielders and attackers on the same height on the pitch and that it might look like an 4-1-4-1 or 4-2-3-1 but it still is 4-3-3.  Thx in advance!  For those here who want to know:  4-3-3 can look like this:  D= defender  /  M= Midfielder  /  A= attacker  1st option: ""the triangle pointing forwards"". Meaning the middle midfielder and middle striker are positioned slightly before the midfielders and attackers on the flanks. The midfielders form a triangle shape this way and so do the attackers.  ---D-------D---------D--------D---  --------M----------------M---------  -----------------M-------------------  ------- A------------------A---------  ------------------A-------------------  2nd option: ""The triangle pointing backwards"".  Meaning the middle midfielder and attacker are placed slightly behind their fellow midfielders and attackers on the flanks. Again this creates triangles among midfielders and attackers.   ----D-------D--------D--------D-----  ------------------M-------------------  --------M-------------------M---------  -------------------A-------------------  ---------A-------------------A---------  In this case the 2 attackers on the flanks drop back a bit when not actually attacking so then it looks a bit like an 4-1-4-1 but it actually isn't. (Also the space between the midfielder and attackers in this picture is a bit exaggerated because I had to us ""enter"" twice to get separate space in between them).   The point of the triangles is not only to created multiple passing option among midfielder or attackers alone but throughout the whole pitch triangles are created this way and so as much as possible options are available to pass the ball towards. Especially when in attack switching play from the left side to the right side or visa versa is faster which allows you to stay in ball possession and encircle your opponent which give you the opportunity to look for the right moment to come up with that pass that splits open the opponents defense.  It would b good to have understood that what's is perceived in english media as a 4-1-4-1 is in fact a 4-3-3 with a triangle pointing backwards and a 4-2-3-1 is in fact a 4-3-3 triangle pointing forwards.  One might think in a 4-1-4-1 you play  4 defenders, 1 pivotal point in front them, then 4 midfielders and then 1 attacker but in fact there are still 4 defenders, 3 midfielders  and 3 attackers and they perform there particular role as such.

reddevils,3duwt0,Kagawaful,3,Sun Jul 19 21:30:23 2015 UTC,"Schweinsteiger excited by Manchester United future after Tour 2015 debut  Manchester United summer signing Bastian Schweinsteiger admits he is excited about his future at the club after making his unofficial debut during the 1-0 win over Club America in Seattle on Thursday evening.  The Germany international and World Cup winner joined the Reds from Bayern Munich earlier this month and has been training with Louis van Gaal’s squad for almost a week. In that time, the 30-year-old has been settling into the group and learning more about United on Tour 2015, presented by Aon.  Schweinsteiger made his first appearance as a half-time substitute against Club America at CenturyLink Field, helping the Reds cement a comfortable victory against the Mexican side. ManUtd.com conducted an exclusive interview with him afterwards, and this is what he had to say…  You have just made your debut for Manchester United. How did it feel? It was great, an absolutely great feeling to wear the jersey and I think we also played well and I am looking forward to playing more games, especially at Old Trafford.  What emotions were you feeling at half-time, when you were about to come on?  I was more excited and not so much nervous. I was excited to see how it is and also about my fitness. It was a good test for myself, to see how it is. I felt okay so that was a good sign.  How was your fitness during your 45 minutes on the pitch? Did you feel sharp? Yes, I felt quite sharp. In the last 10 minutes, it was a little bit harder to breath. But especially the first 30 to 35 minutes, I think, it was good.  It was a competitive match, with plenty of tackles. Did you feel we deserved to win? It is true that this Club America team was very aggressive and also every player was good on the ball, so it was not so easy. I don’t know if it was similar to the Premier League teams, I don’t think so, but it was a good test for us and what we practised in the last few days. We wanted to have control of the game, to stay compact and I think we did well.  Another of our new signings, Morgan Schneiderlin, scored the winning goal with a first-half header. Were you impressed with his performance, and how good a player is he? I think he was very good and he is a very good player. If you see the goal, he did it well with no foul and a nice header. I think he is a really good player and, also, for me, what is more important, is that he is a good boy.  Memphis Depay and Matteo Darmian also made their debuts. Did they catch your eye? I think both did well. I mean, Memphis is an unbelievable talent and he has so much quality and I am sure we will have a lot of fun with him on the pitch. Matteo is a typical Italian but I love that! You can see that he is tactical, he is very good and he is so fast. I think these two are very good transfers for Manchester United.  You played with quite a young team in the second half. Were you impressed with some of the young players on show, and did you enjoy being the experienced player? Yeah I enjoyed it a lot because to watch young players, how they are and how they played with [Andreas] Pereira, Jesse [Lingard] and [James] Wilson. They are all very good players. I have seen a lot of young players in my career and I have to say that these young players are very, very good. If they are doing well in the future then Manchester United could be happy.  Manchester United has a rich history of promoting young players from the Academy to the first team. Do you think that is important in the modern era? Absolutely, and especially here at Manchester United. When they come out of the Manchester United youth team, I think it is very important for the supporters. Of course you need a little mix of youth and experience in your team, but it is important English players and especially from the Manchester United youth team.  The fans were very excited about your debut and cheered your every touch. Did you enjoy the atmosphere inside the stadium? Absolutely! For me, it is everything new and it is a little bit different. I have to say that everything is well organised, first of all. The atmosphere in the stadium was great. With Munich, we always went to China and to Asia. Here it is a little bit different and I enjoyed it a lot."

He simply isn't good enough to get more than 5-10 minutes here and there against the midtable and relegation fodder teams. If we want him to develop into something more than a lanky version of Welbeck he needs to play a lot, and he isn't good enough to do that for United yet."

Who of our strike team was anything above mediocre last season? Rooney, only just about maybe? There were matches where he got 10 touches in 90 mins.  The system is totally different to old United style, how many chances fell to our strikers last season? They were making the runs, they just weren't getting the ball.  Reason is simple, LVG values possession over risk. It's a legitimate tactic, so don't get me wrong. He would rather we make one good chance and hardly ever lose the ball, than 5 OK chances and regularly lose the ball.  Either all 4 of our strikers were shit last season at the same time, or there is something more to it. I go for the latter."
reddevils,3dv7x2,GarethGore,5,Mon Jul 20 11:38:59 2015 UTC,"true, but especially if we get another striker, Wilson won't be getting game time. Januzaj on loan to a mid table PL or LL team, then Wilson on loan to Villa. sorted"

Then Sherwood comes in. He tells Cleverly to play attacking football, he makes a 19 year old Graelish a starter for Aston Villa and makes the team score tons of goals compared to the 14 in 25 games prior they had.

I suppose ADM leaving, Toni being a RB, Pereira and Lingard going on loan, and Depay playing central are all possibilities, so if a few of those happened we'd have a good number of wingers."

reddevils,3dtw8e,mink551,-4,Sun Jul 19 18:35:04 2015 UTC,Really isn't. People need to remember he's barely played in the last year or so and hasn't been great when he has either. His whole game has declined to what it was before.
reddevils,3dtw8e,MattARC,3,Sun Jul 19 20:02:05 2015 UTC,He's competing for a place with the Messi/Suarez/Neymar trinity. Only a handful of players in the world would be able to get decent game time competing with those three for a place in the starting 11.
reddevils,3dtw8e,mink551,-6,Sun Jul 19 20:57:20 2015 UTC,And? I already clearly said that when played he wasn't great either.

reddevils,3dtw8e,ReflectingGod,39,Sun Jul 19 12:41:05 2015 UTC,"Do we? We only have Young and Depay with Mata and Di Maria capable of playing on the wing but not to full ability and are best not played there at all (Di Maria might be leaving). We'll be playing 60 games maybe next season and with injuries and for the sake of resting players for big games, I'm sure the youth will have plenty of chances."
reddevils,3dtw8e,WillyMorganOnTheWing,43,Sun Jul 19 12:50:36 2015 UTC,Di Maria has played 95% of his career on the wing. Four months at Madrid doesn't eliminate the past. He's a winger.
reddevils,3dtw8e,Spenttoolongatthis,8,Sun Jul 19 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"Yea, I really liked him on the wing. He has speed, can beat players and has great cross field distribution. I'm kind of hoping he gets more time out there, could become a real game changer for us."
reddevils,3dtw8e,DumbledoresFerrari,5,Sun Jul 19 16:28:42 2015 UTC,We paid 60m for him based on his appearances in the middle though. Take away his brilliant 6 months in the middle and we'd have paid about 40.
reddevils,3dtw8e,honey_pie,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:34:20 2015 UTC,Well I'd like to agree 'cause I think he's so much more effective at CM (why is everyone here putting him on the wing for next season!) .. but Van Gaal did say before buying him that we were lacking a world class winger- like ADM or CR7.
reddevils,3dtw8e,MattARC,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:22:20 2015 UTC,"Everyone's putting him on Wing this season because ADM's style at CM doesn't match LVG's ""philosophy"" that was used last season.  LVG has tended to play a very rigid defensive structure, with his CMs not really drifting wide. ADM as CM at Madrid would drift wide left and effectively become a winger while Ronaldo cuts in to find scoring chances.  We could end up seeing ADM reprise his Madrid CM style this season, though, if he can form a good understanding with the Memphis/Shaw bromance that seems to be forming. Memphis at LW likes to cut in for scoring chances much like Ronaldo, leaving space for ADM to drift wide. We'd need the other CM (or CMs? If we choose to play 4-3-3 instead of 4-2-3-1) to cover for ADM defensively while he does this though."
reddevils,3dtw8e,ParkerZA,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:45:21 2015 UTC,"What really excited me this season is that we finally can try a tactic like this, thanks to Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and Fellaini. We don't need to be cautious and afraid to play Memphis and Di Maria on one side. Can really open us up to some dynamic football."
reddevils,3dtw8e,inu50kza,16,Sun Jul 19 20:59:05 2015 UTC,"None of those are right wingers bar Adnan and he (i) wants to play centrally and (ii) is seen by LvG as more of a second striker.  Right now our RW options are Mata, Lingard, Valencia, Darmian and Rafael.   Lingard aside none are proper right wingers and Pedro is a big upgrade on him.  I've kept DiMa out of this for obvious reasons."
reddevils,3dtw8e,peduxe,18,Sun Jul 19 12:53:04 2015 UTC,"Rafael might be sold, Valencia and Darmian will compete for RB. Mata is currently the unique RW we will probably rely on the most."
reddevils,3dtw8e,inu50kza,8,Sun Jul 19 13:01:15 2015 UTC,I listed all the options because knowing LvG he'll find a way to play anyone remotely qualified in those positions but the reality is we are shoehorning an out of position Mata and it's harming our attack. Pedro's probably the best we can do on the market right now for a spot where we have zero depth.
reddevils,3dtw8e,creakyspine29,3,Sun Jul 19 13:06:35 2015 UTC,Mata was one of our best attacking players during the second half of the season playing on the right. Plus he linked up incredibly well with Herrera and Valencia. He's far from the weakest part of our attack. His range of passing is also important to vanGaal's possession game.
reddevils,3dtw8e,Creamy_Goodne55,13,Sun Jul 19 19:57:33 2015 UTC,"I dont get this notion of young players should be getting more chances when they have had enough.   Yes I agree Pereira should be given a chance this year and I would guess he will be on the bench for spurs and Depay is a first teamer but Januazaj has done nothing to suggest in the last year that we should not be buying somebody and giving him a run in the team.  If Pedro is better than him (And he is) then I have no issue with signing him and Adnan missing out, going on loan. The fact is if Adnan was good enough and took his chance he would be our starter and we wouldnt be looking for a replacement."
reddevils,3dtw8e,digitag,2,Sun Jul 19 12:54:50 2015 UTC,"I do agree re: Januzaj but I don't think these things are that clear cut. Sometimes good management is recognising potential and letting a player realise that potential, even if there are better options available. There's a trade off to be had because if you play a smart risk on a young talent they could turn out to be the best player in your team.  I would like to see Adnan go on loan though, I genuinely don't think he's ready or worth the risk yet."
reddevils,3dtw8e,ballsywallsy,6,Sun Jul 19 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"We'll have four competitions next year and hopefully we'll be going all out on everyone of those.

He will get his chances, watch, especially now that Memphis makes Adnan look like a child with his physique."
reddevils,3dtw8e,IBENGM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"The problem is he cannot compete with world class talents like pedro at the moment(if he comes ofcoz),and pedro is not injury prone like di maria he can play more than 30 games without injury, so januzaj will not get many game to play(which he needs for his development)."
reddevils,3dtw8e,danlawl,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:47 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter, the player not wanting to go out on loan shows he wants to fight for his place. LVG will give him his opportunities due to the amount of matches."
reddevils,3dtw8e,Reibus,6,Mon Jul 20 00:57:10 2015 UTC,We will sign him because di Maria is leaving.
reddevils,3dtw8e,GarethGore,3,Sun Jul 19 12:47:57 2015 UTC,"that's sweet, but Januzaj has shown nothing, Depay is fresh to PL and Pereira has seen flashes of skill but is still young. I'd like them to get chances, but I don't want to get fucked because they don't step up. And with two of our wide players as Young/Valencia, and DiMa maybe leaving I'd still like another player who can play on the wing."
reddevils,3dtw8e,Kenzhiki,38,Sun Jul 19 17:03:08 2015 UTC,I really hope that we're after him. Would be a superb signing and I think he would definitely shine for us. Love the way he plays and his determination.

You can have all the technical ability in the world but you can't be a winger without pace. Even Iniesta and David Silva who are inverted number 10's have an amazing burst of acceleration. Mata is glacial.  Pedro is like a gold plated Lingard. Not amazingly creative but a good finisher, great link up, tidy in possession and tracks back well with a great work ethic."

reddevils,3dtw8e,inu50kza,8,Sun Jul 19 13:32:03 2015 UTC,Good not great athlete. He doesn't have Bale/Robben/Ronaldo pace or Hazard/Messi/Ribery acceleration but he can be deadly on the counter.
reddevils,3dtw8e,TheJoshider10,13,Sun Jul 19 12:55:29 2015 UTC,"He's much faster than Mata though, and whilst pace isn't everything it can be vital on the wing."
reddevils,3dtw8e,inu50kza,8,Sun Jul 19 13:06:34 2015 UTC,Completely agree. It's not everything but it's a prerequisite. He's significantly faster than Mata.
reddevils,3dtw8e,TheJoshider10,6,Sun Jul 19 13:25:49 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Plus you could argue Mata's lack of pace means he isn't a good long term solution for that role especially since it's not where he'd usually play, but fair play to him he tracks back and does his job incredibly well. Not a bad thing having different options though!"
reddevils,3dtw8e,ManUToaster,4,Sun Jul 19 13:28:31 2015 UTC,"I don't mind him for variety - same goes for Fellaini, players fall in and out of form all the time but we do need a proper winger too. Competition for places is a good thing."
reddevils,3dtw8e,inu50kza,3,Sun Jul 19 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"Indeed, so Pedro is a perfect match. Considering how well he'd fit into our system he'd probably be one of the top signings we could make this window."
reddevils,3dtw8e,monsterm1dget,19,Sun Jul 19 13:42:10 2015 UTC,"After Mata's performance at RW and the clear improvement in our attack and defence when Lingard came on   Wait are you saying that Lingard is better than Mata at RW based on one game? cause if anything I thought that what Mata proved last season is that you don't need to be blistering fast to still be a fantastic winger... I thought his performances as a ""false winger"" (I think that's what LvG called it) were fantastic and I mean... he used to be a winger in Valencia and his performances there is what got him a move to Chelsea, he hasn't gotten any slower...  I think getting a competition for the RW position is a wise move, but we don't need to throw Mata under the bus..."
reddevils,3dtw8e,inu50kza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:05:06 2015 UTC,"I'm basing it off the last 3 years, the last match just brought it glaringly to light.  I love Mata, he's technical and has an amazing touch but we can't be blind to his limitations. He had a 5 match spell of form and then got figured out. From the Chelsea match onwards he was awful.   He's been bad on the wing for Moyes and Mourinho as well.  Even during all that neat interplay and those lovely triangles with TonyV and Ander the end result more often than not was a cross to Fellaini. They were hardly ripping open defences and getting clean, direct shots at the goal.  Mata hasn't played well since Benitez was his manager in 2012/13 and is no long term solution. I won't pretend to have watched him at Valencia but he's shown nothing over the last three years to prove he can cut it at RW.  Can you imagine playing him there having to defend against Neymar + Alba, Ribery + Alaba, Ronaldo + Marcelo? We'll get destroyed against any decent team. Valencia can cover for him defensively against Spurs but he can't shut down a world class left wing on his own. Darmian is better defensively but doesn't have Valencia's engine and will need a proper winger in front of him."
reddevils,3dtw8e,monsterm1dget,6,Sun Jul 19 14:15:02 2015 UTC,"Well, that is why he isn't a winger. He was a solution to a non-existant problem."

Do we even have another one now?"

reddevils,3dtw8e,IBENGM,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"In spain he was a great winger, but I think that maybe has to take into account the more space and slower tempo in spain."
reddevils,3dtw8e,ManUToaster,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:26:27 2015 UTC,"He has a role to play from the right, but not every game. You just wouldn't play Mata on the wing against a Real or Bayern. You'd play a more appropriate set up. But he'd definitely play a lot of games through the year and do well. I remember Fergie dropping an in form Ronaldo against Chelsea once. He played Park instead as he need to nullify the threat from the Chelsea wing. We won 3-1 I think. Horses for courses and all that."
reddevils,3dtw8e,inu50kza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:17:46 2015 UTC,"look im not saying mata should be sold,i want him to stay but he should improve massively to reach the form he produced for chelsea ''he was on world class form'' if he wants a place in starting 11,look at it this way-di maria didn't have a good season at united and played fewer games but he produced more assist than anyone in our squad,if pedro comes mata will miss out based on current form!"
reddevils,3dtw8e,BoyWhoCanDoAnything,0,Sun Jul 19 21:26:59 2015 UTC,"That's interesting that you say Darmian doesn't have Valencia's engine because one of the attributes I read about him (haven't seen him play) was that he could run up and down all day.   As far as Mata, I understand where you are coming from, tbh I thought he has improve his defensive play a lot and in any case I can't see Pedro being much better... To say the first 45 minutes of pre season brings anything to light is a bit harsh imo... But idk agree to disagree I suppose, I think Mata is absolutely brilliant in a possession style of football and you criticize him for crossing it to Fellaini but it was Mata's cross to Morgan that got us the goal against Club America... As he showed against Liverpool (granted very bad defending) he has the positional awareness to split defenses open when the ball is played quickly, he is also a good finisher... He's definitely not your traditional winger, but I think he's an excellent player for LVG's philosophy, but like I said, it's a wise move to have something different for when Mata is not being effective."
reddevils,3dtw8e,Momoalas93,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:47 2015 UTC,"I thought he has improve his defensive play a lot and in any case I can't see Pedro being much better   You can't be serious.   I think Mata is absolutely brilliant in a possession style   I actually think he's at his worst playing possession. He played his career best in a counter attack system with plenty of space to feed willing runners, it's the only system he's played well in at Chelsea. He doesn't thread through balls or have the intelligence/possession retention to play CM like Cesc Xavi Modric etc. He doesn't have the acceleration or ability to beat a man other no.10/wingers like Iniesta David Silva Turan or Hazard have.   He's a good finisher but he doesn't have the crossing ability to justify his spot on the wing despite no pace like Beckham.  He works best as a number 10 in a 4231 but that formation/system is outdated and ineffective.    not your traditional winger, but I think he's an excellent player for LVG's philosophy   LvG's philosophy and system requires pace on the wings for quick transitions. He's only playing because he's less likely to give the ball away stupidly like DiMa. LvG has always preferred fast wingers who track.  Mata may have improved his work ethic on defence but it doesn't change the fact that he's shite at defending. Zero technical ability on defence and awful positioning. If we're just playing players because of a soft first touch and great technical ability in possession why did we bother selling Nani?"
reddevils,3dtw8e,mentalcaseinspace,0,Mon Jul 20 20:38:57 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. He was great for us from the right last season. That set up needs a RB who is willing to bomb forward, and we have that."

reddevils,3dtw8e,djokov,6,Sun Jul 19 15:06:57 2015 UTC,"The future of Pedro Rodriguez as Barca comes to an end . Manchester United has entered the scene and will bet very strong by the incorporation of Tenerife . The decision is already taken by Louis Van Gaal and the English club made ​​an official offer next week will be between 18 and 20 million pounds . That is, between 25 and 29 million euros. An amount that meets the aspirations of the Catalan club . When Pedro renewed at the end of last season , Barcelona and the player that if he agreed to a club with an offer of over 25 million, the club would be willing to negotiate his departure . And this is what will occur next week with the offer of the United. Everything indicates that the clubs reach an agreement .  The departure of Pedro is not liked by Luis Enrique , but all are aware of the desire of the player to play more minutes. He wants to stay in the call for Del Bosque for the next European Championship and that means hold wherever play . Barcelona knows that that is not possible now . Messi, Neymar and Suarez will close off and leave you only the minutes of garbage. Pedro logically aspires to much more and spent several months looking for new equipment.  At first, what Chelsea had in mind. He is a player that fits what you want Mourinho on a front. It was a good choice of signing, but its renewal all went downhill. The record of Pedro rose considerably and then ceased to be a goal for the English club. Which was better placed to try signing was the PSG, with the possible departure of Lavezzi. There were contacts between the French club and Pedro, but it was subject to market movements. The option to Di Maria just leave the French club, has opened the door for United to Pedro. The option still seduces the Barca player. It is a team that will be fighting for all the titles and an undeniable sporting potential. Also in that team they play two good friends like Ander Herrera and Juan Mata."

reddevils,3dtw8e,princessvaginaalpha,2,Sun Jul 19 13:24:31 2015 UTC,"You're right, but you can make educated guesses based on what we know about LVG's system and those players.   Looking objectively at LVGs emphasis on a possession system, Pedro is far more suited to the role and he's very accustomed to playing that way for Barca.   As to whether or not we're shopping for the sake of it, well i don't think we are. RW is an area of comparable weakness for us. Mata had some decent games there but in others he's been totally ineffective. Valencia is too one dimensional. AdM has been worse than Mata when he's played there, but I reckon he's leaving anyway"

reddevils,3dtw8e,IBENGM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:37:00 2015 UTC,"Guys, don't panic about too many players, we are not trying to rebuild anymore, Van Gaal obviously set his sights on winning as much as possible this year.  For a team that has been plagued by injuries last season, that is now chasing 4 cups, we are going to play a lot of matches, and our team hasn't gelled as much as Chelsea for example who get 1 or 2 players per season.  We almost completely overhauled our team in the last 2 seasons, only Rooney and Dave being unchanged from their starting position, and this might make it seem we bought too much, but if Van Gaal signs Pedro I trust his judgement. I really have faith in our manager and I don't doubt this is the right call.  Remember how excited we were about Falcao? It was the right move getting him, granted it didn't work out but it was still a sound decision by Louis."
reddevils,3dtw8e,devil27,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:43 2015 UTC,This signing makes sense if Di Maria is leaving although I really want Di Maria to stay and prove himself in the PL. Di Maria at his best is a much better player than Pedro. The only reason why LVG is buying Pedro is he would suit our possession based style more IMO.
reddevils,3dtw8e,IBENGM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:15:43 2015 UTC,"And Pedro is more consistent than AdM. Though not nearly as good as AdM at his best, on average Pedro is a better player.

reddevils,3dtw8e,devil27,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:29:40 2015 UTC,Would be a top signing especially since he can play #9 as well and being a la mesia graduate he definitely has the passing skills to play in the system
reddevils,3dtw8e,IBENGM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:30:43 2015 UTC,"Here is what i think Pedro will bring to the team if he comes, GOALS!!!(which we need),he is not much of a creator as a winger like ADM, he is more like an Inside Forward who is very tricky,fast and Clinical(he is more clinical than any striker we have), He can play LW or RW equally as good since he uses both feet.  With all that said i think we should get him ASAP and we should not sell Di maria. Januzaj however has to go on loan in a BPL team though,were he can get more games and develop,we already have a lot of Youngsters as it is anyway!!  Then the competition for places will be really on!

And he has had a lot more first team experience than Pedro who mostly came off the bench on Barcelona.   I'm not a fan of him. He seems small and fragile. Fine for La Liga but not sure on the Premiership.  In any case in Louis and Ed I trust.
reddevils,3dtw8e,Feezbull,2,Sun Jul 19 20:05:40 2015 UTC,Valencia doesn't have a lot more first team experience.   He's also a lot worse as a player than Pedro is. Valencia can't cross. Can't dribble. Can't beat a man other than using pace. Can't use his left foot.   Hardly a good winger at all anymore now.   Mata too is small and fragile. Jesus Navas is as well but his pace makes up for it and allows him to go past men. Pedro can dribble and is fast. Raheem sterling isn't a big guy either.
reddevils,3dtw8e,RFerrer-,4,Sun Jul 19 14:35:12 2015 UTC,"Come on, Navas literally only has pace. He's pretty mediocre. Pedro is a good player but he has never been first  choice at Barca. That's something to consider."

I don't know how things will change this coming season with the signings we have made but we have to improve drastically in terms of the chances we create if we are to win the title this season  thats for sure!"

reddevils,3dymmy,Calimariae,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:38:54 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call ligue 1 a top tier league though...
reddevils,3dymmy,Patoromia,2,Tue Jul 21 02:36:38 2015 UTC,But Veratti excelled against Barcelona though
reddevils,3dymmy,plesir,2,Tue Jul 21 06:01:59 2015 UTC,"Considering a lot of people seem to think Sterling is one of the most promising talents in the world, i'm not sure what to think anymore."
reddevils,3dymmy,L__R,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:53:11 2015 UTC,"He is promising, but had a mediocre last season - and he never really impressed the way true talents like Rooney in his teens did."
reddevils,3dymmy,Kenzhiki,3,Mon Jul 20 19:48:55 2015 UTC,"I recall Memphis was listed as the top talent on some french list, but the likes of Verratti and Pogba weren't there and I assume because they didn't consider them as talents anymore, but world class players. Anyway, I think he's very high up when comparing him to other top talents, but he's only played well in a fairly weak league and hasn't had a chance to prove himself in a better league compared to Verratti, Isco, Pogba and Varane. For now I'd say that those players are a step above Memphis, but I really do believe that he has the potential to be world class."
reddevils,3dymmy,GroteBergMan98,10,Mon Jul 20 16:32:55 2015 UTC,They aren't in the list because they are over 21 years old

All of those players have an extra year/year and a half over Depay at a time frame where players get better with every match. We won't know how he compares with them until the end of the season IMO.  He compares well with contemporaries like Sterling and Januzaj."
reddevils,3dymmy,Oblivion753,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:26:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure what you mean by ""Top Talents"" but the only way to fairly grade him is by comparing him to other U21 players around the world. He should be compared to players like Marquinhos, Zouma, Kovacic, Kane, Mitrovic etc. These are the players you should have listed, and even these players are a farce to compare him to because they all play different positions.  To give you an answer look at players available around the world that are U21 wingers. Depay, Januzaj, Timo Werner, Draxler, El Sharaawy, Ox Chamberlain, Sterling, Berardi, Lucas. These are the best young wingers i can think of (Might be missing a couple) Where does he rank out of THIS group would be where you would start projecting his worth and determining where he ranks relative to his upcoming generation. Extremely promising as he is probably 2nd or 3rd on that list of what look to be truly great wingers."
reddevils,3dymmy,ikilledasalesman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:39:21 2015 UTC,I would like to see his performances in his debut season with United as well as playing CL football first before judging him.
reddevils,3dymmy,bosnian_red,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:45:17 2015 UTC,"Isco, Pogba and Veratti are all a lot more experienced then Memphis is, and have played in more difficult leagues... Would be a more fair comparison  comparing those right now to Memphis at the end of this season coming up. But IMO, out of the promising youngsters right now, like Januzaj, Sterling, Memphis, Munir, Odegaard, etc., I'd say Memphis is definitely right at the top and at the highest level currently. Think he's going to become a brilliant player, just have a feeling with him, and he obviously looks class on the pitch as well so it's not all gut feeling."

reddevils,3dymmy,icesurfer10,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:34:49 2015 UTC,I would be uncomfortable comparing him to other big name players at this stage. Particularly as he hasn't been in one of the elite leagues around the world. I think we'll have a better idea at the end of the season. There's no doubting his potential though.
reddevils,3dymmy,TrollingPope,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Based on last season it would be easy to say he's better than someone like Sterling, but Sterling was playing in one of the two toughest leagues in the world. It's impossible to make that judgement yet."

reddevils,3dymmy,Allard1994,6,Mon Jul 20 16:45:08 2015 UTC,There is a difference between close to and in.
reddevils,3dymmy,colinnisbet197,4,Mon Jul 20 16:46:32 2015 UTC,"He's not close. He's not even played a game in a top, top league."
reddevils,3dymmy,colinnisbet197,4,Mon Jul 20 16:49:38 2015 UTC,"Well, he played in the World Cup and did perform just as well if not better than them there."
reddevils,3dymmy,MiLSturbie,3,Mon Jul 20 17:02:25 2015 UTC,Very good point but it's still a small sample size and it is only arguable that he played better. They have played to that level for a few years now.
reddevils,3dymmy,GroteBergMan98,2,Mon Jul 20 17:08:12 2015 UTC,"To be fair, neither has Veratti. Okay he's played the champions league a few times now, but Ligue 1 is very poor. I'm not saying Memphis is better (they're actually not very comparable), far from it, just pointing out that Ligue 1 isn't necessarily better than Eredivise."
reddevils,3dymmy,Custard_Noob,-3,Mon Jul 20 23:59:56 2015 UTC,I'd say definitely in the T3 of 21 talents if not T1
reddevils,3dymmy,DJKhaled_anotherone,-10,Mon Jul 20 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"I would say he is just below Isco's level currently but has a higher ceiling than him. I believe he could potentially be just as good as Robben, at the very least. I wouldn't be surprised if in 3-4 years time, he is a prime candidate for the Ballon d'Or. (Depending on all the factors of course)."

reddevils,3dwfcj,fergo1993,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:01:10 2015 UTC,"He was interviewed in the middle of last season and asked if he'd ever leave. His response was essentially ""no, unless we don't qualify for Champions League"", albeit in more words, and obviously German. Schalke did not qualify for Champions League.

reddevils,3dwfcj,ZantetXuken,6,Mon Jul 20 09:40:36 2015 UTC,"Before we forget about Otamendi, remember the mind games that are going on behind the scenes, especially if Valencia are holding out for 35m Euros. Last summer our club briefed that we weren't interested in Shaw or Herrera just before signing both.    Otherwise I'd want us to look at Stones, Laporte, De Vrij, Dragovic, etc"
reddevils,3dwfcj,GarethGore,5,Mon Jul 20 13:38:10 2015 UTC,John Stones?  and I like Dier from Tottenham too.
reddevils,3dwfcj,Muppetx,3,Mon Jul 20 09:55:51 2015 UTC,"Same problem as De Vrij, both are young and not experienced enough to be leaders. We already have a bunch of fairly young CBs, we need older more experienced ones."
reddevils,3dwfcj,monnii99,2,Mon Jul 20 04:59:46 2015 UTC,De Vrij is a leader at a young age though. He has already captained Feyenoord and the Dutch national team.

reddevils,3dwfcj,nickooj,2,Tue Jul 21 16:01:15 2015 UTC,Thing is Everton apparently turned down 20mil from Chelsea for Stones.. he's way too expensive considering hes only really played one full season
reddevils,3dwfcj,Compieuter,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:06:29 2015 UTC,Stones might be one for the future but I'd like to see him get more experience under his belt. Dier isn't good enough for us to be honest. He hasn't helped the Tottenham defensive cause much and might lose his spot to Alderweireld.

Who would be in your 25 man squad?  At minimum, 2 players (not from list-B or club trained) will be unable to play in the champions league this season. I would say Reece James and Guillermo Varela. Any more signings would force other players out of the squad. This would allow Valdes and Evans to have like for like replacements should they leave.  All players are currently eligible for the Premier League"

Carrick has one year left. 4. Young is unlikely to spend more than one year left either.   Some of the U21s are going to be homegrown next summer so they'll most likely fill in the quota."
reddevils,3du8ut,xtfftc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:01:11 2015 UTC,I was thinking that too. Might be worth keeping Rafael and Evans for one more season as back-up then?
reddevils,3du8ut,nickooj,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:07:47 2015 UTC,"I'd like to have them in the squad but since their contracts expire next summer, we either have to extend for a few years or sell soon.

reddevils,3du8ut,hsd932,2,Mon Jul 20 16:11:00 2015 UTC,"Really nice job setting this up!  The wording on the rules is a bit heavy handed. but it basically means that you need 4 players trained in club out of those 8 slots. you can have all 8 be trained in club and there is no limit to how many of these you can have in the squad. The way its written in the rules makes it seem like you can only have 4 unless you really fine read it due to the really ""Law wording"" used.  I can also say that I checked and both Rafael and Rooney are club trained like others have pointed out.  Shaw and Powell will always remain Association-trained as not having been at the club long enough to be club trained just to have that information out there.  Januzaj can be registered in the main squad and count as club trained if needed for the CL (if we sell players like Rafael and Evans). Though if possible it would be better to use him for the list-b to have other options available.  However we do need some of the youngsters currently to step up and be good enough for a regular spot (or atleast squad rotation) spot so we will be able to use the club trained spots for the CL with good players. So the pressure is really on all the guys on the b list except Powell (due to the mentions above).  Edit: corrected and made it clearer about the club trained rule."

reddevils,3dujcu,Madddevil,39,Sun Jul 19 16:44:55 2015 UTC,Of course. Fellaini is a good option to have but i'm glad we invested this summer because plain and simply going in with Fellaini as a starting CM is not the type of style we can play if we want to get back to the top. It was a good short term success but now that we've got some proper depth to midfield he can now be used in much more specific situations where we can utilize his strengths.
reddevils,3dujcu,TheJoshider10,20,Sun Jul 19 16:47:27 2015 UTC,I agree with you. Fellaini still has an important role for us and could be very useful against teams that have a height advantage over us or could be used as a late sub if we're planning on going full out attack in the last 15 or so minutes - since he can be a physical force upfront and hold the ball well

reddevils,3dujcu,mynjo,6,Sun Jul 19 19:22:27 2015 UTC,"Marouane Fellaini must fight for Manchester United place says Van Gaal  Marouane Fellaini is in a fight to regain his Manchester United starting place, Louis van Gaal has warned.  The midfielder is suspended for the opening three matches of the Premier League because of the red card he received at Hull City on the final day of last season. Van Gaal is using the four-match tour of America, United’s only matches before the campaign begins on 8 August, to assess other midfielders. In Friday evening’s 1-0 win over Club America in Seattle Fellaini did not play despite the manager deploying different sides in each half.  “Fellaini is suspended for the first three matches and he has longer to be ready, so I have to look at other players,” Van Gaal said.  Fellaini fought his way into Van Gaal’s strongest XI last season but will have to wait until 30 August to be available for a first outing. That is United’s visit to Swansea City. However, as Van Gaal now has many options in midfield the Belgian could face a struggle to play.  Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin were bought on Monday to join Ander Herrera, Michael Carrick and Daley Blind at the club. Against America, Mexico’s most successful team, it was Schneiderlin who particularly impressed.  Fellaini was one of only four players not to feature. David de Gea and Antonio Valencia missed out because of minor injuries, Van Gaal said. Shaun Goss, the youngest player on the trip at 19, might have expected not to play. The Belgian, though, would have.  Instead Fellaini had to watch as Schneiderlin produced an impressive all-round midfield display that included the fifth-minute header that gave United victory.  Van Gaal said: “He scored with Southampton, I believe five goals, so it is not a coincidence but we have practised this with him, so I was very pleased with the performance.”  Of United’s other new signings, Schweinsteiger was efficient in the second half; before the break Memphis Depay and Matteo Darmian showed promise. The competition Fellaini faces is mirrored around the squad. Although he operated as a No10 against America, Depay is a recognised wide forward, an area where Ángel Di María, who is absent due his post-Copa América holiday, likes to play. When Valencia recovers he will compete with Darmian for the right-back position.  Chris Smalling, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans, Tyler Blackett, Paddy McNair and Daley Blind – all of whom featured against America – along with Marcos Rojo, who is also resting after the Copa América, are in a fight for the two centre-back berths.  Blind, who can also play in central midfield or at left-back, may be moved into defence permanently. “It could be,” said the manager. “Marcos Rojo is not here. He shall come on 25 July. I want to play always with a left-footed central defender and Blind can do the job. Maybe he shall play there but all the players can play there. Last year it was Jones and Smalling, and even McNair has played there. But my preference is a left-footed defender and with Rojo and Blind we have two.”  Against America United were uneven, as is often the case in the first tour match. “It is our first 45-minute game. I wanted to see our defensive organisation and that was the main aspect,” said the manager. “We didn’t give a goal away, only one or two chances, so I am satisfied about that. We played like a team and [Club] America was very handy with the ball, all of the players were very aggressive and quick, so it was not so easy.”  United fly to California on Monday for the next International Champions Cup game. “We use this tournament for our match rhythm, to build it up,” said Van Gaal. “So we play the next match against San Jose and we will also play 45 minutes for all of the players. That is our philosophy and then we will play 60 minutes and 30 minutes. Maybe in the last match we will play for 90 minutes, or use another team to play for 60 minutes. I have to read the data of the players. But our plan is to play the next game with 22 players.”  As with last year’s trip to the US the pitches remain a concern. CenturyLink Field was heavily watered before the match as One Direction had been in concert here. Van Gaal added: “The pitch was difficult. You saw that a lot of players slipped. You can get more injuries, which is a concern. But also last season against Real Madrid we played in such circumstances [at Michigan Stadium]. That is the difference in the US with American football stadiums, it is more important. In England we have Old Trafford and it is only for football. It is not for entertaining. There is no One Direction. In England we live for football but in USA they live for American football and baseball.”"
reddevils,3dujcu,Slyman180,2,Sun Jul 19 16:45:56 2015 UTC,"No direct quote in that article about Fellaini having to fight for his place, just that he doesn't have to be ready for the first few matches and Louis Van Gaal is using this tour to bed the new players in and get them ready for the first few league games.  He has three major qualities, his height,  his strength and his physicality. These are absolutely invaluable in the English game. There will be times you need a big hard dirty player on the field. We all saw Fellaini written off before and we've seen him prove the experts wrong.  It must be a slow news day over at the guardian."

Madrid use a seniority system, the most senior player will always take the armband and it's never announced officially.

Rojo fits the bill a bit, so another player like that wouldn't hurt.   De Gea can join the long list of players at Real who suck Ronaldo's dick and flop at that circus of a club.

So, at Sukru Saracoglu stadium, before i8,ooo manic fans and 25 camera crews, he took to the pitch with Bouchra, his wife, Shaqueel, his son, and Dina, his daughter.   Instead of the usual sight of a new signing doing a couple of keepy-uppies on their  pitch, Fenerbahce’s faithful got the whole Van Persie clan. Robin juggled the ball with Shaqueel and swapped passes with shy little Di. Turks, family people, loved it. “They were even singing my name!” Bouchra laughs.   Shaqueel, eight, highly promising, will join  Fenerhahce’s academy, having been at Manchester City’s. “Now he says ‘dad, at our presentation...’ because he thinks he made a transfer as well,” Van Persie grins. “That’s the target I wanted to reach. My family are as much part of this move as me.”   His own inner eight-year- old was awakened at Sukru Saracoglu. “The passion! I had other options [in Italy and Spain but that’s why I chose Turkey. Football has to be  fun. That’s my aim, to go back to that childhood love of the  game.  Go back? Fun dwindled for him at Manchester United last season. It was a baffling one.   He started having been Louis Van Gaal’s captain-confidant in Holland’s superb World Cup campaign. He ended as Van Gaal’s Invisible Man, out of the United team, then out of the first-team squad, training on Carrington’s Pitch Two, reserved for surplus players the club wants to sell.  He is not going to rake over the breakdown in his  relationship with Van Gaal. What is the point?   Van Persie lives in the  moment, not in the past. He and Bouchra seem buzzing with energy about their new chapter in Turkey. An  international school has  already been found for the kids, they are house-hunting, and learning Turkish. We are sitting, close to midnight, in warm air in a hotel garden in Asian Istanbul. A stroll away there is a chic marina and a cafe-lined promenade. Life changes, but life is good.   Van Persie will look back on United and remember not the final months but the warmth of the dressing room, his bonds with people. “After the deal [with Fenerbahce] was done 1 got texts from Sir Alex, David Gill, Ed Woodward — who was very classy in making this move straightforward for me,” he says.   “At Carrington, because I was training on my own at the end, 1 waited two hours after my session for the first team to come in, to say goodbye to the players and that was nice. Ed said I’m always welcome back and that’s what I’ll remember: Manchester United is a beast where everything you do, good or bad, has bigger impact. Like Arsenal, it is a family club, a classy club.   “I’m not aiming for my career to be the perfect fairytale and the ending at United is just a small part of the story. If you look at the whole thing, it was beautiful:  11 years in England, with help from two of the greatest managers, Arsène [Wenger] and Sir Alex, playing with great players, so many friendships, the welcome from English people.   “I came aged 20 to sign for Arsenal [from Feyenoord] and when the deal was done we quickly bought a little car, drove back to Rotterdam, packed three suitcases and off we went. Now we’re leaving with three lorries. Bouchra keeps everything. She’s still got all the tracksuits of  Arsenal, of United.  “We had our kids in  England, built our family  there. Right now, if we had to choose between living in  Holland and England when I finish playing it would be  England.”   Arsenal was his school. “Arsène is my football father. He raised me from being a little kid, as a footballer. ‘What he does, for players young and old, is create an environment where you feel the trust like one big family.   “People think there was an argument between us.. On the contrary we always had a lot of respect for each other. We just had some different views at the time and I’m still talking to Arsene regularly now. He is a world class coach and manager and above all, a classy man.   “Trust, respect, that goes  two ways. That’s what Arsène gives, what Sir Alex gives, that’s what the great  managers give you...” He did not feel he was given those last year.  Some Arsenal supporters will never forgive his United switch but maybe others now will. “Time heals,” he says, “but I understand. If you’re Arsenal captain and top  scorer and move to United, fans will be upset. And not for one second have I been angry about that.    “I wanted to win the  Premier League. And we did at United. But I had a very special time at Arsenal. Some might want to erase me from their history, but no one can change the facts. I did score 132 goals for Arsenal, I did play close to 300 games. One year as a captain.”   His chemistry with Sir Alex Ferguson was immediate. He scored 30 goals as United won the title in 20 12-13 but went scoreless for ten games. “I was waiting for it: ‘When is he   going to give me his hairdryer treatment?’ But he said ‘It’s fine Robin, you’ll score and even if you don’t score you’re helping the team.’   “We came from behind that season 26 times. The mental strength was unbelievable. Fergie always made you express yourself. Sometimes he’d come in and say, ‘Boys, where do I start? It’s boring! Imagine me, 72 years old, watching this kind of game?”  “He’d say, ‘Excite me. Try a pass over 40 metres. Try a  dribble. I don’t care if it goes wrong. I want to sit on the edge of my chair. Please excite me. And make the game  quicker, please.’ He was a genius.”   Then there were close  dressing-room bonds. “I did check before moving, how are players like Giggsy, Scholesy, Ferdinand, Vidic, looking at me? Would they still see me as a rival, an Arsenal player? But the comments were  positive. From day one they accepted me.   “The first training session we had three boxes, where you play six v three, seven v two, five v four, and they  straightaway put me in the best box. You get a signal  there. You’re not starting in No 3. You’re starting Box One, with Giggsy, Scholesy,  Ferdinand, Carrick.   “It’s funny. A couple of  years earlier we went away on holiday to Majorca and Vidic was there with his family. We ended up in the same gym barely speaking to each other. Now he’s one of my best  friends. We actually went to Majorca last month to stay at their house.   “Rio? He still calls me his  driver. He had a ban for six months and lived close to us. One day I brought him to the game. We won. And he’s superstitious. So, for every game, I had to pick him up, even when he could drive again. And he still got to pick the music for the car!  “I texted him to say I enjoyed the winning — but I enjoyed the journey there, the banter in the car and the serious conversations, for he’s a clever guy, just as much.   “Wayne [Rooney] is very funny. And a great player. We became very good mates. It was an invention of the press that there was a problem between US. The same with Moyes. It [replacing  Ferguson] was a very hard job to take. He did everything in his power to do well and people were very harsh on him. We liked each other.”"
reddevils,3dtgob,RedDevil237025,78,Sun Jul 19 08:09:36 2015 UTC,"Part 2    So, last season. Van Persie scored 10 goals in 25 league starts — only a shade off his normal strike rate. His running stats (11.5km per game) were the best of his career. He knows he has shown better form but certainly did not - and does not - feel in decline. What  happened?   “The World Cup was very intense, physically and  mentally, especially as a  captain. Maybe I needed one more week’s break before the season. Over Christmas I  played three games in six  days, full games, and my  (ankle) tendon got inflamed but I kept playing, taking  painkillers, to help the team.”   He injured the ankle  seriously when crossing the ball against Swansea in  February. “I think it was just extreme tiredness.  “That was one of the tricks of Arsène and Sir Alex,” Van Persie says. “Sir Alex knew exactly how he would handle Rio or Giggsy or Scholesy. That’s how they played on so long. Arsène knew exactly how he would manage  Bergkamp. That is a  managing skill and not every coach has that skill.”   Before his lay-off the wind was already changing and communication with Van Gaal, so cordial with Holland, was growing difficult. Then came Chelsea away. Rooney played in midfield but Van Persie stayed on the bench and remained unused, even   though United were 1-0 behind and chasing goals.   “That was one of the first signals things weren’t going in the right direction,” he says.  “I asked to play in the reserves, to get my minutes, but after was on the bench again. The atmosphere changed between me and Louis and people at the club saw it, but I was always professional. At that point I didn’t think to leave. Bouchra was happy. The kids were happy. I was happy in Manchester.”   At United’s annual golf day, in May, he sought out Van Gaal. They finally talked and he realised his prospects were fading. “But I was still thinking we could come back from holiday and start from scratch. He had changed his mind about me before. When he took over Holland he said to me ‘You’re the No 3 striker.’ I was ‘O...K...’ but I fought and became the No 1 and his captain.   “But when I came back, it wasn’t an honest battle any more. Fighting to get back in the team wasn’t given me as an option. He was sending me to Pitch Two. And I’m a mature player. I’m not stupid. I didn’t get angry or  emotional. These things are part of football, part of life. You have to make the best out of any situation so I’m doing this by moving on.   That’s it for Van Persie.  Book closed. As a dressing- room leader who knew Van Gaal well, he sometimes tried speaking on behalf of other players and suspects it  counted against him. His  general observation is, “I  know Louis as a national team coach and now I get to know him as a club coach. And  there is a difference.”  But he is not sitting by the  Bosphorous, wondering.  Instead, he is getting fired up about the new season. Van Persie is one of eight signings (including Nani and Simon Kjaer) made by Fenerbahce, who also have a new coach, Vitor Pereira, a Portuguese who won titles in his  homeland and Greece. He is looking forward to packed, passionate stadiums and freer football: 3-5-2, used at United for half of last season, limits a striker’s movements and Van Gaal is rigid about where he wants his No 9 to run.   “Fenerbahce will compete for the league,” says Van Persie. “We have a hard task to beat Shakhtar Donetsk [in a Champions League preliminary tie] but hopefully we can and after that I’d love to take on the challenge of Man United [in the  Champions League]. I’d love it. Not with anger or anything, but for the beauty of the game. And also to get the chance to thank the  Manchester United fans in person because they have been great to me.”   He is 32 next month and has a three-year contract but, now rested, feels “better than ever” and hopes to still be a top player at 38. Will we see him back in the Premier League? “Maybe. In football, who knows the future? Things change fast.”"
reddevils,3dtgob,benhanks040888,51,Sun Jul 19 08:09:56 2015 UTC,"Wow, LVG in ruthless mode. You're too old, you're out. You don't want to play for the reserves you're out. I like this LVG"
reddevils,3dtgob,freckleddemon,56,Sun Jul 19 08:24:33 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't have to be that ruthless to win things, case in point SAF himself.  I think LvG is stubborn as hell, and if it means us winning things in the end, I'm okay with it. But if he's stubborn just for the sake of being stubborn, then I can see that players won't regard him as highly as SAF.  Treating Robin and Valdes (okay maybe not Valdes as he's just been here one year) on their way out is not okay IMO. If he wants to sell Robin, then just go ahead and do it. He doesn't need to put him in Pitch Two (I know it's RvP's words and might not be the truth, but I don't see that he has a reason for making things up) and leave it at that.  Imagine if this happens in another club like City, Liverpool, Arsenal or Chelsea. Years before, we as United fans would've said ""Well, it will never happen in United"", but now, it did, and just because LvG is our manager, it doesn't mean we have to justify everything he's done."
reddevils,3dtgob,cylonseverywhere,59,Sun Jul 19 08:51:44 2015 UTC,"Well, you don't have to be that ruthless to win things, case in point SAF himself.   Fergie was equally  ruthless."
reddevils,3dtgob,BigCheeser,36,Sun Jul 19 08:53:41 2015 UTC,"Fergie was even more ruthless. Van Gaal has gotten rid of under performing players but Fergie got rid of any player that would question his authority. Sure, Van Gaal is going to make mistakes by letting SOME players go, but making sure his authority isn't questioned is worth risking a few mistakes and losing some good players."
reddevils,3dtgob,Surilliar,-16,Sun Jul 19 09:16:33 2015 UTC,Fergie still gave them a chance he wasn't an evil dictator like
reddevils,3dtgob,BigCheeser,10,Sun Jul 19 10:41:43 2015 UTC,You might want to have a word with Jaap Stam.
reddevils,3dtgob,Surilliar,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:23:05 2015 UTC,Stam wrote a book stating he was tapped up and dressed down some of the players like saying Keane was living in his own planet. You lose the trust of the players like that and he should have waited until he was finished before letting that come out like many other players should have also.
reddevils,3dtgob,Krokodzl,4,Sun Jul 19 13:44:32 2015 UTC,Okay? What's your point?  Fergie got rid of him immediately. Didn't give him a chance. Just packed him off to Lazio.  Did the same thing with Keane. Beckham. Ince. Kanchelskis. Strachan.  Your point was Fergie wasn't some sort of dictator and gave his players a chance. Your point is absolutely wrong.
reddevils,3dtgob,inu50kza,-6,Sun Jul 19 13:47:55 2015 UTC,"Fergie was a hateful old git. Van Gaal offloads people he doesn't like, wow, bug deal. SAF was perfectly capable of having people rot in resevers, block transfers, and basically ruin entire careers if you stepped on his toes."
reddevils,3dtgob,GrapeBread,32,Sun Jul 19 17:22:31 2015 UTC,"That’s it for Van Persie. Book closed. As a dressing- room leader who knew Van Gaal well, he sometimes tried speaking on behalf of other players and suspects it counted against him.   This is the key line. Read between the lines, he questioned authority and got frozen out.  It's from RvP's side and biased. I'm not saying LvG isn't being over the top but we don't know exactly the nature of RvP's complaining.   In the NT you have to be diplomatic because you have a limited pool. At a club you can buy replacements so you don't tolerate people destabilizing your iron grip.  LvG has never been good at managing older players, he likes kids who are eager to prove themselves, learn and follow blindly. One of the key things SAF managed to do imo that puts him in a category of his own - could manage 35 yr old legends and kids just as well."
reddevils,3dtgob,emtheory09,3,Sun Jul 19 11:41:11 2015 UTC,"Idk, I think he just got too old and lost his pace.   LVG has said he likes his strikers to have pace so that it puts pressure on the defense and helps create space. If RVP can't do the job then there's really not much more to it.  The other thing to keep in mind is our injury problems. We had an insane number of injuries last season and a big part of letting RVP and Rafael go might be their inability to stay fit.   I really doubt it was anything personal. I think LVG has his senior striker in Rooney and wants to do what he has always done and develop younger players."
reddevils,3dtgob,yiyiyiyi,2,Sun Jul 19 15:13:45 2015 UTC,I think the pace and wanting to bleed some you thinner the key aspects here. Maybe LvG didn't handle it as well as he could beut those tensions are auxiliary to the first problems.
reddevils,3dtgob,benhanks040888,13,Sun Jul 19 17:24:36 2015 UTC,"Fergie and LVG are just totally different.  LVG has a checklist of things you must do to play for him. If you don't tick all the boxes then you're out, regardless of status, ability or impact on the team.  Fergie was much more willing to play the long game. He'd let his best players have some leeway and then stab them in the back when he was ready."
reddevils,3dtgob,devilsway,8,Sun Jul 19 11:19:53 2015 UTC,"Ruthless, but Fergie at least has some kind of sentiments around him.  Look at how he never treated Scholes and Giggs badly throughout the end of their careers even if they had some bad games. Even when he did, he probably dealt with it quickly and personally so it doesn't spread around in the media.  IIRC, he also had some problems with Rooney a few years ago, but quickly resolved that and Wayne became one of his favorite players.  Sure, some players like Beckham and RvN got a bit ugly. But the Beckham thing was more of an 'accident' (SAF accidentally kicking the boot towards Becks was probably what did it), and RvN IIRC was more because he caused ruckus in the training ground (against Ronaldo, Fergie's favorite, nevertheless). Others were simply let go because they're not good enough.  But look at SAF treatment with less stellar players like Park Ji Sung, Nani, Brown, O'shea, Smith, etc (I'm just listing names that come to my mind here). Even if they had a bit of dip in form because of age or injury, he didn't just go ""Okay, you're not good enough anymore, I'll sell you next season. For now, just go train with Reserves"" or something like that. He still managed them accordingly, and probably because of that, in the end, even when those players did get sold, they never had bad things to talk about Fergie. Which is pure good man management if you ask me.  My point is LvG could've dealt with RvP or Valdes privately, but for some reasons, he did it his way. Probably to make a point that he's in charge, which is good, but it does not necessarily have to be this way."
reddevils,3dtgob,MR777,7,Sun Jul 19 10:41:26 2015 UTC,"The key clue for LvG treating Robin like this was that he tried talking on behalf of other players.  Fergie was kind towards form but does not tolerate players questioning his authority, no matter how good you were.  I'd guess LvG is the same, for better or worse."
reddevils,3dtgob,TheFormidableGiant,5,Sun Jul 19 12:42:20 2015 UTC,"RvN IIRC was more because he caused ruckus in the training ground (against Ronaldo, Fergie's favorite, nevertheless).   It was because Ruud called Fergie a cunt. (source: Fergie's recent autobiography)"
reddevils,3dtgob,LioAlanMessi,6,Sun Jul 19 12:07:59 2015 UTC,"If Ferguson was to be described in just a single word, it would be ruthless."
reddevils,3dtgob,lammot,4,Sun Jul 19 09:42:03 2015 UTC,"Wrong, it would be winner. SAF had to be ruthless because he felt that was the best way to keep the team together and win titles. If he had thought that being friends with everybody was the best way to do so, he would have done it. Because above all, he loved to win."
reddevils,3dtgob,WillyMorganOnTheWing,2,Sun Jul 19 17:03:10 2015 UTC,any examples of him sending top quality players to practice by themselves?
reddevils,3dtgob,BigCheeser,22,Sun Jul 19 09:09:33 2015 UTC,"Multiple. Ruud Van Nistelrooy wasn't allowed play in what would have been his last match at Old Trafford or even in Roy Keane's testimonial.   Fergie was the most ruthless of them all. Ask Jim Leighton, Mark Hughes, Andrei Kanchekskis, Jaap Stam, David Beckham, Roy Keane etc etc. When he was done with you...you were done."
reddevils,3dtgob,WillyMorganOnTheWing,3,Sun Jul 19 09:26:49 2015 UTC,"RVN was abusing Ronaldo for quite a while and it affected the dressing room and he also tried to have a go at Fergie, he had to go. All the people you mentioned here needed to go because they went way over the line. SAF was ruthless but he wasn't the worst in any way and he showed plenty of compassion and most of those player also made an effort to apologise to him."
reddevils,3dtgob,BigCheeser,3,Sun Jul 19 10:47:14 2015 UTC,It can't be argued that Ferguson was not ruthless and controlling. All teams have players that cause trouble or who don't get along. Ferguson put up with until the moment he thought they were no longer valuable. That is ruthlessness.
reddevils,3dtgob,monsterm1dget,2,Sun Jul 19 15:10:21 2015 UTC,It can't be argued that Ferguson was not ruthless and controlling.   nobody was    Ferguson put up with until the moment he thought they were no longer valuable. That is ruthlessness.    It's not as simple as that. He was ruthless at times and in others he at least gave them a chance. Giving them a chance before thye over stepped the line is the opposite. Just because they were let go doesn't mean they were ruthless either. None of those players you mentioned can really turn around and say 'I was hard done by and I deserved to stay' maybe Ince but he was still acting out a bit. Players that were maybe hard done by and not given a chnace were players like Taibi who never really had a chance to recover.   SAF was more ruthless with the players after bad performances or keeping them in line in terms of their personal lives affecting the game. And after all that he was still big enough to admit to his mistakes which he did plenty of times. That's hardly the description of someone labelled 'the most ruthless of them all'. There were defiantly a lot more ruthless managers out there.
reddevils,3dtgob,RedDevil237025,4,Sun Jul 19 15:23:16 2015 UTC,"Sometimes i think LVG came here to build up a team and leave in three years. If you're not gonna be part of the team by then, no point sugarcoating.  It's a heavy feeling."
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:38:31 2015 UTC,"Does putting a player on pitch two mean the same as practice with the reserve team ? If so, does the manager not have the right to put a player who he doesn't see fit to be in the first team there ?   RVP was a great player, won us the league but he went to Fener for a very small transfer fee. That's not a player I want leading the line at United while getting paid quite a bit.   I like the fact that LVG didn't do him any favors just because he was his Dutch captain during the World Cup.  LVG is stubborn. There's no way around that. But I am pretty sure he knew the situation. I don't see him talking condescendingly to Giggs or Wayne."
reddevils,3dtgob,benhanks040888,9,Sun Jul 19 09:13:07 2015 UTC,"Van Gaal also always finds trouble at each club he's been at one way or another - board or players.   It's not surprising. Is it good? No. But let's hope he doesn't keep this up. Because if his friend and captain rvp could be treated this way and just cast aside, players might wonder if they could be next."
reddevils,3dtgob,monsterm1dget,2,Sun Jul 19 09:41:43 2015 UTC,My point exactly.  Imagine if the next players to get this treatment are the fan favorites like Mata or Herrera?
reddevils,3dtgob,_WhatIsReal_,2,Sun Jul 19 10:27:25 2015 UTC,Mata and Herrera have never shown this kind of attitude.   I  remember this not being the first time he has been noted as not a pleasant person.
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,2,Sun Jul 19 13:47:05 2015 UTC,Excuse me but what kind of attitude? Im actually pretty concerned with what RVP has said in this interview about the way LVG dealt with him.   I know this is just from RVP's side so im not taking the interview as fact.
reddevils,3dtgob,AE71,2,Sun Jul 19 14:58:12 2015 UTC,"I hope as heck he doesn't but I wonder if the same folks saying- oh it's blown up now. It's only one side. Etc etc will say the same should that happen?   I highly doubt it.   I'm not even saying this because I'm a big rvp fan. I simply refer to Valdes as an alternate example right now even. That's 2 players already although Valdes did ""cause"" some of it due to his refusal or so however, he certainly didn't create the talking point nor drama of the press leak initially with the interview.   And Valdes was also his friend, old time player, brought him up too etc.   It's good though that Herrera at least was very keen on working on his game as LvG wanted and so were Shaw etc. hopefully he doesn't find something to nitpick and blow up with anyone else now."
reddevils,3dtgob,kiac,5,Sun Jul 19 10:32:01 2015 UTC,"I think what RvP is really questioning is why he didn't get a second chance. I think he deserved atleast a pre-season to justify his choice. Also, it was not only RvP that was underperforming, Rooney as well and Falcao. All our strikers, and I think partly because we were certainly at most times hoofing the ball up to Fellaini. If Van Gaal doesn't get us in top two or we don't get through the CL qualifier, should we sack LVG as well and be as ruthless as him? It's easy for him to ask for three months, the six and then a whole year, but he doesn't give chance to players. People hate to admit it, but LvG was scared last season, and always ended up with his plan B 'Fellaini'"

I wonder how he would feel, if United had asked him to manage the youth squad after he achieved only 13 points from 10 games.

reddevils,3dtgob,DevilDonnie,91,Sun Jul 19 08:17:41 2015 UTC,"“We came from behind that season 26 times. The mental strength was unbelievable. Fergie always made you express yourself. Sometimes he’d come in and say, ‘Boys, where do I start? It’s boring! Imagine me, 72 years old, watching this kind of game?” “He’d say, ‘Excite me. Try a pass over 40 metres. Try a dribble. I don’t care if it goes wrong. I want to sit on the edge of my chair. Please excite me. And make the game quicker, please.’ He was a genius.”   my favorite part"
reddevils,3dtgob,SureAviator,20,Sun Jul 19 08:20:45 2015 UTC,Gary Neville in his MNF after the game against City home said that there was structure and preparation in attack. And going by this you think it's no wonder the football under SAF sucked in the last 2-3 years. This is the kind of stuff Moyes got slated for. SAF in his last couple of years won just by the mental strength factor. Going behind 26 times shows there ia definitely something wrong with the gameplan. Mulesteen and Phelan at fault too.

I can just imagine the last small trigger would be the ""Don't care if it goes wrong"" - thats really about helping them do the pass or dribble with full focus without the pressure, which is probably why it succeeded so often under him.

He had a ban for six months and lived close to us. One day I brought him to the game. We won. And he’s superstitious. So, for every game, I had to pick him up, even when he could drive again. And he still got to pick the music for the car! “I texted him to say I enjoyed the winning — but I enjoyed the journey there, the banter in the car and the serious conversations, for he’s a clever guy, just as much. “Wayne [Rooney] is very funny.

reddevils,3dtgob,funkinghell,30,Sun Jul 19 15:02:33 2015 UTC,"Don't even see why LVG got rid of him, should of  have (grr) kept him. I just hope their will be no more rifts between our players and LVG.  Edit: Correcting bad habit."
reddevils,3dtgob,IvanBerk,15,Sun Jul 19 08:21:31 2015 UTC,"Sentimentality speaking. I wished we had kept him too, just for one more season and see if he could turn it around. Absolutely loved him as a player. BUT  1) He was going on a downhill slope, injuries starting to flare up and fitness levels decreasing.  2) Game time, we're going to play a 433 one man striker system and that striker role is Rooney's, who barely gets injured. Next in line would have been van Persie but he would have killed Wilson's chances of promotion with such little games to play for.  3) Cost, he cost ~ 11-12M in salaries and we got a 4M fee for him. Essentially, would you have paid 16M+ for one more season of van Persie? 16M+ for about a max of 20 appearances? Didn't make financial sense.  Do I think Louis is in the wrong? No, I think Louis is bang on and isn't ruthless but is pragmatic. You can say he screwed van Persie over but at the same time he's put an incredible amount of faith in Wilson if he is promoted to 3rd striker and ensures he plays a far bigger role this season (he wouldn't have done so with van Persie wanting game time ahead of the Euros)."
reddevils,3dtgob,funkinghell,9,Sun Jul 19 10:03:29 2015 UTC,"This a really interesting comment,  thanks for making it but I'll respectfully disagree. I don't think Louis has been pragmatic at all.     The reason why is can't we use your exact same reasoning and apply it to Schweinsteiger for example?     1) From Bayern Munich supporters they generally believe Schweinsteiger is over the hill, and has had serious injury issues these last 2 seasons. Probably playing less than RVP.  2) Is Schweinsteiger  not taking game time away from Man U's central midfielders? With Schnedarlian, Carrick, Herrera, as well as now Schweinsteiger that's not a great amount of game time.  3) Schweinstiger isn't exactly cheap at 14.3 m a year either.      This for me suggests that  if  letting RVP was the right thing to do, then as much as I love Bastian signing Schweinsteiger was the Wrong thing to  do. Especially given Schweingster may take time to adapt where is RVP was already used to the league.      I like LVG a lot and he's done a lot of things right. But I think he's got this one wrong, especially when they're far more good midfielders out there, than strikers."
reddevils,3dtgob,SomebodyReasonable,5,Sun Jul 19 11:50:27 2015 UTC,"Whilst you make a good counter argument, there is clearly more to it than footballing reasons alone.   Whilst we don't know the whole story, I'm guessing for starters that RvP does not provide the same leadership qualities as Schweinsteiger does. Even if Bastian gets injured, or struggles for fitness, LvG probably can still rely on him to mentor players and act professionally. Bastian probably also does not expect to start every game, and that he is not going to be be the main man at the club. RvP, on the other hand, seems to thrive of being the best and most important player at the club... LvG may have simply been unable to promise RvP the minutes that he desires.   On top of facing less game time, RvP was likely unhappy to be behind Rooney and Falcao last season, which may have been reflected in his attitude towards training, his team mates, and the manager. This was likely a reason why the relationship between LvG and RvP became strained. Schweinsteiger is not going to be as upset about missing games, or being behind another player in the pecking order. On top of that, with a three man midfield, Schweinsteiger has more positions to play in and less players to compete with than RvP. There'll be more minutes available for a backup midfielder than a back up striker in the system LvG uses."
reddevils,3dtgob,IvanBerk,3,Sun Jul 19 14:23:14 2015 UTC,"These are good points.  You're definitely  correct in a)we have no clue of the full story,  that RVP could  have contributed to the conflict and b) There are potential factors beyond pure footballing ones. I just don't think a) or b) is enough to justify LVG decisions.     With regards to a) RVP contributing to conflict, I think your correct in suggesting RVP contributed to this falling out, I would speculate however, that  the majority of this conflict still lies on LVG.  Why? Well while a great manager,  LVG has a history  littered with far more player and board conflicts,than your average manager. The importance of LVG in these conflicts is potentially clearer when you consider some of the players he has fallen out with aren't like Ballotelli, but players who don't have a history of being difficult to work with and very professional.  The only common factor in these conflicts are LVG who while excellent manager does  strain relationships consistently.  *nbsp;  b) In terms of the minutes  and pecking order argument. It seems (and  I admit this may be bias because it's an RVP account) that RVP was more than happy to fight for his place, and has a history of trying to do so. So I don't see this as contributing to the conflict personally but hey thanks for the discussion"
reddevils,3dtgob,SomebodyReasonable,2,Sun Jul 19 15:15:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of what you are saying, but I was not really trying to justify LvG's decision. RvP was still a useful player for us, and LvG should have been able to utilise him since that is his job. LvG has certainly failed to do that, but until we know the whole story we cannot absolve RvP from some of the blame either.  I was just highlighting that the reasoning for RvP's departure does not conflict with the reasoning for the arrival of Schweinsteiger... but that does not detract from your point that LvG could have dealt with the situation better."
reddevils,3dtgob,IvanBerk,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:38:56 2015 UTC,"The reason why is can't we use your exact same reasoning and apply it to Schweinsteiger for example?   Because Schweinsteiger won the World Cup in 2014, and while Van Persie got off to a good start, he sucked in the rest of the tournament. He shows the same problems in the Dutch national team as with MUFC.  I also suspect Van Persie is a bit of a party man outside of the pitch, and he his discipline was slipping.  IMO, the comparison fails."
reddevils,3dtgob,StannisJr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:16:28 2015 UTC,"Your entitled to your opinion :) but I  believe you're wrong for a number of reasons:  1) The World cup is an awful way to justify your views because the sample size is tiny. You shouldn't judge Schweingster on  roughly 7 games in the summer. Otherwise you'll end up saying things like we shouldn't buy Aguero, Hazard, because they didn't have a good world cup but Schweingsteiger did.     2) World cup has huge divergences in team quality making judging players based on their team  performance unfair. You're comment that Schweingster justifies being here because""Schweingster won the World Cup in 2014"" is unfair. Schweingstieger had the likes of Ozil, Muller, Lahm, Neurer, etc  RVP  basically had  robben + 9 others. Imagine suggesting Ronaldo doesn't deserve to be here because while Schweingsteiger won the world cup Ronaldo only got of to a good start.      c) Last but not least we're talking about Transfers into the premier league.   Let's assume that for some  bizarre 6  world cup games, was a good indicator of player quality. Than  however, would just means a player performs well internationally. There would be no guarantee that Schweingster would replicate his form in the BPL (see Di Maria, Ozil, Veron, Pique, Forlan, Rossi) for a list of players who  could perform very well elsewhere, but not to the same standard in the BPL."

reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:10:31 2015 UTC,legit. you have to think in a managers perspective. one day it had to happen and so he had to lay off a fellow countryman for the sake of both RVP and the club. one day it will happen to Rooney also so he would have to move to MLS so he can still play most the time and also it gives the chance for new youth prove themselves. I'm sure all of us are excited at our youth forwards.
reddevils,3dtgob,StannisJr,20,Sun Jul 19 11:26:28 2015 UTC,"*Should have  I'm beginning to see LvG as a good club manager and a poor player manager according to these statement and recent events. I wish he would listen to his players more, accommodate their needs and keep the family atmosphere going on at the club. Yes we wanna win, but we wanna stay classy just as much."
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,3,Sun Jul 19 08:39:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. He's a bit volatile, I don't think he'll ever change because that's just the way he is I suppose. The players have mentioned the atmosphere is good for now, so that's good. We don't need any drama."
reddevils,3dtgob,scrantonic1ty,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:53:19 2015 UTC,"He won't change if he hasn't by now. He's done it from Ajax to Barcelona to bayern and now to United as well despite not having a board hovering over him.   But that's also why his shorter term contract is better for us in the long run because if he stayed for say, 8 years for instance, I can see a fair bit more falling outs and alienation of players along with bad blood happening. I hope as you said, this isn't the start of things but it seems as you said, they are ok and they guys maybe are yes men under him now. But they could wonder if they're next because if RVP was a victim, how about a new signing with no relationship to him?"
reddevils,3dtgob,wdtpw,0,Sun Jul 19 09:58:34 2015 UTC,"That's what I worry too, if a new signing was bought in, then felt the manager was mistreating him or something, and then he starts regretting ever coming. He can also go and tell other players it's a bad place to work etc if they have an interesting in ever joining."
reddevils,3dtgob,iceman58796,0,Sun Jul 19 10:03:49 2015 UTC,"Or a non senior player because he usually would align himself to them of course as it makes sense as well.   Now I'm not saying he looks to assert control and then go crazy but, he's known to have falling outs for a variety of reasons honestly and this could be a detriment to things, especially younger guys who might be afraid of the manager in some ways due to their stature.  Let's hope this was one off and nothing else comes up in time for the rest of his reign."

reddevils,3dtgob,xtfftc,7,Sun Jul 19 13:15:06 2015 UTC,"On the one hand, every player who is told he's past it has a problem with the manager who tells him. Some get over it quickly, some don't. It happened with Beckham (briefly), and it happened big-time with Keane. So I don't think much against LVG here - that's just him doing a manager's job. Sometimes there's no way to win a conversation like that.  On the other hand, I do think we're transitioning from an exciting team to one that plays it safe more often, which isn't the United way. I really miss a manger who would say something like this:   ‘Boys, where do I start? It’s boring! Imagine me, 72 years old, watching this kind of game?” “He’d say, ‘Excite me. Try a pass over 40 metres. Try a dribble. I don’t care if it goes wrong. I want to sit on the edge of my chair. Please excite me. And make the game quicker, please.’ He was a genius.”"
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,2,Sun Jul 19 09:26:29 2015 UTC,When's the last time we were an exciting team bar a few games here or there under Fergie? Certainly wasn't the case for the last few seasons under him.
reddevils,3dtgob,xtfftc,-4,Sun Jul 19 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"There is a way to win-   Robin you're not first choice in my view now but, if you want to prove yourself, you're welcome to try although, I am planning for things without you as first option now so, if you prefer a move, I won't hold you back and we will listen to offers.   Or to that extent maybe instead of shunning him. What's the point? Why poke a knife in when there's no need to? He could even say, also, because of your wages, we hope to find a solution quickly.   Valdes- you've gone against what I preach so, I don't tolerate it and will let you go.   He didn't have to do it the way he did. Definitely not with Valdes too in the media.   And the way rvp gave his side of things didn't even show any bitterness but a more truthful account instead as a play by play thing. Even Mitten's article further strengthens this concept actually.   Plus LVG's history of fall outs with players for decades."
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:02:21 2015 UTC,"There's limited spots on a team. Keeping Persie means not signing another option. Or, giving Persie 2 months until the end of the window means signing a replacement in the last possible moment in case he doesn't prove himself.  And that's without taking into account his high wages and the transfer fee we would have missed on."
reddevils,3dtgob,xtfftc,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:33:23 2015 UTC,"So freeze him out and shun him instead and throw him away?   I wonder if all those who are so eager to suck up to the way LvG does this will not throw a fit if Mata was somehow treated in a similar or worse way because... Well, it's not like he hasn't fell out with players before.   But apparently, the LvG jerk is strong in this thread."
reddevils,3dtgob,jammybear,4,Sun Jul 19 10:39:26 2015 UTC,"Fergie would get rid of fan favourites year after year after year.   And everyone should be perfectly aware that van Gaal is not an eays character. He always ends up in serious conflict with people at the clubs he manages.   And yeah, I expect Mata to be offloaded as soon as the opportunity for it appears."
reddevils,3dtgob,ioluas,-3,Sun Jul 19 10:50:05 2015 UTC,The thing is people are acting like LvG isn't a difficult character on this thread and are all- oh he's right. Absolutely. Good call. Good work.  Even pointing out LvG has had conflicts for decades at the clubs he managed isn't taken too well here it seems.   Replace rvp with mata and half of those would be swearing and calling LvG a prick I'm sure.
reddevils,3dtgob,JeSuisLouis,2,Sun Jul 19 11:03:05 2015 UTC,"Van Gaal is right, this is a good call and good work.   However, you've demonstrated selective reading - many posts complain about van Gaal and are upvoted just as much as those who point out Fergie was similarly ruthless."
reddevils,3dtgob,Samoeraijack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:07:08 2015 UTC,"Everyone knows LVG definitely is a difficult character, and he's ruthless as fuck - but the point people are making is just that Fergie was as well. Sometimes it's whats best for the club to maintain control over the dressing room (speaking generally, not about RVP's situation). He's also been given loads of complements by our players for being very funny, warm and caring off the pitch.   It's really harsh on the players some times, and of course there's probably better ways to do it - but a lot of people respect how he rules with an iron fist and takes no shit from anyone.   This really is only is one side of the story though. RVP being made to train alone or being told he doesn't have place here anymore isn't really out of the ordinary? Wether or not Mitten's comment about him telling him his future in front of everyone are true or not is a different matter. This article is saying that RVP was the one who questioned LVG over his future at the golf day, I doubt he'd ask that in front of all the other players...  Regarding Valdes, again we don't know the full story - but assuming it's true that Valdes did refuse to play for the reserves then fair play to LVG for telling him he doesn't have a place in the team. It's extremely harsh doing it in a press conference, but he's making an example of him."
reddevils,3dtgob,nicebike,46,Sun Jul 19 11:43:01 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this. I can't help but feel that LVG screwed RvP over.  This and the handling of Valdes weren't classy at all. People will remember that if he fails to achieve at Utd.  For everybody's sake, I hope he wins us the league this season."
reddevils,3dtgob,ioluas,33,Sun Jul 19 08:29:23 2015 UTC,"No this is typically RvP when things don't go his way. Don't get me wrong, I'm a dutch fan and was always amazed with RvP's football skills. But he has something very sneaky about him too. To many times in the Dutch nat. team he didn't bring what he should've brought and it was never RvP's fault. He had riffs with multiple players and he showed to have and ego that easily equals LvG's.   ""As a dressing- room leader who knew Van Gaal well, he sometimes tried speaking on behalf of other players and suspects it counted against him.""  This for instance is a typical RvP remark to make. What is he suggesting? That he was sold because he tried to talk to LvG or LvG is a man who doesn't want to listen to the players even not when represtented by their dressingroom leader? Who instigated that there where topics to be disgusted with LvG anyway. Wouldn't surprise me if RvP used these talks to show his team mates he's the man who knows LvG best and they can leave it to him to sort things out. Wouldn't even surprise me that the discussed topics where picked or brought up in a players meetings by RvP himself (and would mostly benefit his own agenda).  If so I can imaging that LvG might felt his authority could become questioned. Anyway it's always the same with RvP if things don't go his way he comes with vague remarks that make you question other's. Never is he going to admit he wasn't good enough himself. To bad he doesn't show the class he suggest LvG is lacking.  On LvG: As a manager there are tough decisions to make and it's very likely that not every player you showed the door will be thankful for that. Interviews where ex-players try to question and undermine your position can be expected. I think LvG will cope.  E: did quit some editing"
reddevils,3dtgob,cylonseverywhere,2,Sun Jul 19 10:28:47 2015 UTC,Completely agree. I've had the same impression of RvP. In the end Robin had the opportunity last year to show that he was good enough: He was mostly shite and there is not much reason to give him another chance.
reddevils,3dtgob,nicebike,14,Sun Jul 19 14:51:34 2015 UTC,"How did he screw him over? I mean RVP is my favorite United player, but I'm not sure how he has been screwed over."
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,8,Sun Jul 19 08:42:47 2015 UTC,"He wasn't allowed to train with the first team after the holiday. I think even if a decision was made to let him go, it could have been handled better.  Also, from what RVP said, his personality in the dressing room was a reason for the judgement he received.  Anyway, I said this is what I understood from the article."
reddevils,3dtgob,monsterm1dget,20,Sun Jul 19 08:51:52 2015 UTC,"That's RVP's side of the story, of course it's going to sound like Van Gaal screwed him over but the facts are there for all of us to see. RVP wasn't scoring enough goals or playing very well, we were all questioning LVG's stubbornness in playing him every week over Falcao and Rooney. And now all of a sudden LVG is the devil for getting rid of an under-performing player."
reddevils,3dtgob,as520,10,Sun Jul 19 09:19:31 2015 UTC,Yeah I remember all those posts here implying that the only reason RVP was still playing was because he's Dutch and best buddies with LVG.
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,-8,Sun Jul 19 09:23:18 2015 UTC,"It's the way LvG does it and come on, I absolutely would believe it more because He's shown to have thrown others in the spotlight before. He's fell out with several before him too.   Valdes is a prime example of him being a dick about it by letting the press and world know when there's no need for it at all.   Mitten also said he told rvp in front of the entire squad that he wasn't needed to play in a training match and to go train on his own.   Only the blindest LvG lovers would not think he's the one who's doing the pushing mainly as he's done for decades in his career at times anyway. It's no different to back then with how he publicly fell out with many players too."
reddevils,3dtgob,as520,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:47:20 2015 UTC,Has he said anything about RVP?
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,25,Sun Jul 19 13:49:48 2015 UTC,"his personality in the dressing room was a reason for the judgement he received   Van Persie is 32, looked knackered after a string of games, was on ridiculous wages, these are some of the reasons why he wasn't kept in the team and now he plays in Turkey."
reddevils,3dtgob,JeSuisLouis,2,Sun Jul 19 09:09:11 2015 UTC,And that warrants him being cast aside because of that? Or being told in front of the team just before he left that he wasn't required to play in the training match and to go train on his own?   Not wanting to use him is one thing- being a complete dick about it is just him being a dick. LvG has been this way towards many before him too.   Letting go of a player because he's not deemed suitable is fine but there's a way to do it without shoving him and publicly shunning him or throwing him under the bus like Valdes was thrown in public. Absolutely no need for it at all.
reddevils,3dtgob,as520,2,Sun Jul 19 09:44:39 2015 UTC,"I don't care about how players who aren't relevant to the club are being treated and this is his side of the story as well, I know it's very harsh but if it's not a detriment to the club, I really don't care."
reddevils,3dtgob,jbiresq,4,Sun Jul 19 09:48:58 2015 UTC,"So you advocate him freezing out and fucking over anyone whom he feels should move on?   Lovely environment indeed that would be.   Just like how he fucked Valdes over by revealing that in public. But I suppose you don't care either.   What if somehow Rooney shows up late one day and he freezes him out, drops him, and forces him out? Just for that. And also makes it public?  It's a bloody narrow minded view of things to just keep it rosy and act like LvG is the be all end all no error man here.   And how can it not be a detriment- any player seeing the way he just shuns others can have second thoughts and also wonder if they could be next somehow should something happen or if their form dropped for a season by nature or bad luck.   Sure, I wouldn't mind it if United kept winning and all but I also would prefer United not to have some toxicity in the dressing room because you know, winning isn't the only thing that matters and United aren't just a football club about results but much more as well.    If players aren't treated well it also paints a bad picture on the club and proceedings which takes away from the gloss of winning.   Madrid for instance- great club. Fucking shit way of being run by Perez who just buys not for need but for stature and how he fires managers like someone changes their batteries in a remote control."
reddevils,3dtgob,Xanian123,7,Sun Jul 19 10:05:33 2015 UTC,"Not RvP nor Valdes where freezed out for being late or ""just for that"" or any other minority.   RvP is passed it ( according to LvG) and Valdes refused to do work he's supposed to do. Why have Falcao or AdM or others never complained about playing with the reserves?   Could it be that because in England it was completely new and so the press really brought this as a big story when they learned that LvG let's people train/play in the 2nd team regardless of their name. And so people like RvP or Valdes now bring up this ""humiliating"" treatment and use it to make LvG look like the bad guy?  Keep in mind that LvG has worked with that same method in NL and Spain and Germany. And the intention has always been to make /keep players fit and give them match rhythmn cause if you haven't play in the 1st it's better for your body to play in the 2nd than not playing at all.   I think how you perceive what ""happend"" has a lot to do with how open you've been to the media driven story that LvG is an complete ass. If you think he is you'll easily find ""proof"" that he is in ex-players stories about the man. I therefore see no point in trying to convince someone else how he should interpret all that's written about LvG."
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,7,Sun Jul 19 11:21:55 2015 UTC,"Fergie kicked out players who were deemed past it or were too big for the club. Not a big deal like the way you are acting. Persie and Valdes going won't affect the atmosphere. Valdes criticism was maybe a bit too far but he has played a grand total of 100 minutes for United and Persie was past it. And for those wages, great business shipping him off.    Edit: This is to counter your Madrid  argument, people here are way too emotional over a 32 year old leaving. Lvg believes in meritocracy, he'll give everyone chances, a top level athlete like VP won't believe he  is past it himself, he'll always think he can play at the top level but in reality is just past it and not good enough for United. Hence why he left for Turkey, not because of his personality. He is not the man to lead United forward and I'm glad LVG is as ruthless as he is."

reddevils,3dtgob,therosepetal,-1,Sun Jul 19 10:25:00 2015 UTC,"He was also one of our most senior players, one of our best strikers, one of our big game players. As one of our best players, he was worth those ""ridiculous"" wages, because him playing well (and more importantly staying fit) is the difference between winning and losing the league. b"
reddevils,3dtgob,JuanRiquelme,3,Sun Jul 19 12:50:25 2015 UTC,"But think of it this way. You bring in new signings. Might have some tactical tweaks and everyone has a new or updated role in the squad. Do you want RVP, someone you have told is not first, second or third choice and are trying to sell, training with the first team and taking someone's spot in training? Someone who is going to play a role this coming season.   I think its fine that LVG wants to practice and train with the players he sees in the first team for the upcoming season and players he sees are going to stay at the club. Its a business and its about winning and preparation. Practicing on pitch two sounds pretty lonely but he effectively wasn't part of the team anymore as he was actively being shopping and talking to other teams."
reddevils,3dtgob,therosepetal,5,Sun Jul 19 09:26:13 2015 UTC,That's what LVG does.   A great manager no doubt but it's hardly the first time he's fallen out with a player to the detriment of the club he's managing.
reddevils,3dtgob,JuanRiquelme,11,Sun Jul 19 08:47:58 2015 UTC,"It's the same with Mourinho and Guardiola though? Some players love them and some actually really hate them. Guardiola also fell out with Zlatan fot example and Mandzukic. Mourinho fell out with Mata, Casillas, Ramos, Pepe. These are the kind of ""you love them or you hate them"" coaches I guess."
reddevils,3dtgob,inu50kza,-4,Sun Jul 19 09:23:29 2015 UTC,They're nowhere near as prolific for it.  Don't think Mourinho really fell out with Mata he just didn't want to pick him and you can hardly say Chelsea weren't better for it.  Mandzukic wasn't good enough anyway for Bayern.  Mourinho definitely fell out with a lot of people at Real but it's much more a one off than LVG who's done it at almost every job he's had an usually leaves under a cloud after 2-4 seasons.
reddevils,3dtgob,JeSuisLouis,4,Sun Jul 19 09:26:56 2015 UTC,"Mata said he didn't really had a relationship with Mourinho and that they just didn't talk, that's a fall out imo.  Does it matter if Mandzukic was good enough for Bayern? Because I wasn't talking about his football qualities. He fell out with Guardiola."
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,-4,Sun Jul 19 09:29:08 2015 UTC,Difference between that and a fall out which is detrimental to the side eg. Rivaldo
reddevils,3dtgob,Ar-Curunir,3,Sun Jul 19 09:46:37 2015 UTC,"Letting RvP in his current form, on his current wages in terminal decline go will be bigger detriment to our side than Bayern/Pep getting rid of the striker that got them the treble?  RvP isn't a saint, he was from the hood and massive hooligan cunt most of his career like Ravel Morrison. Arsene calmed him down but he's always been a bastard. Most of his career he's had drama in the dressing room, esp. with the NT when Arsene wasn't around to calm things.   Rivaldo refused to track back, refused to play anywhere but striker even though he was an awful fit for the system and couldn't play with his back to the goal. He frequently skipped training when he felt like it, on multiple occasions he'd just fly back to Brazil midweek on a whim.  Mandzukic by all account as well as Ibra and Eto'o who Pep fell out with costing him trophies were all cunts as well. You can't have it both ways. Either acknowledge that sometimes you have to sacrifice a top performer who's a cunt for team morale or that every top manager has a high profile falling out every 2-4 seasons."
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,3,Sun Jul 19 11:54:23 2015 UTC,They are as prolific for it as the media or yourself judge them for it. SAF had quite a few fall outs with players and if you hear what Keane has to tell about him you could easily think SAF is a complete cock.
reddevils,3dtgob,mandy_harpoons,-5,Sun Jul 19 10:36:28 2015 UTC,"People are so with LvG that they ignore his falling outs that have been a staple of his ways for decades.   And the fact that rvp never mentions this with malice or angst as shown from the tone shows it is far likelier that he's just telling it like it happened instead of twisting things to make it sound worse. Plus that Mitten article a week or so ago too about how he publicly told rvp he wasn't needed to play in the training match and to go train on his own which surprised the team.   And how he absolutely didn't need to throw Valdes under the bus in the public stage with that. There was literally zero need to do it.   There's a reason why he didn't do it harshly with Carrick who arguably is older and less likely to last as long as rvp was - he wants to establish himself and be on the side of the english/British core of players at the club to aid his standing in the dressing room too so it makes it easier for him.   I mean, Young, Rooney, Carrick, Smalling even, Jones to an extent as well. They're the core of the club and are British and on his side for sure.  That's why he basically, even though he was going to bring in TWO midfielders who could easily mean Carrick is not even 2nd choice, still spoke to Carrick in a way that allowed him to show himself but he chose to push rvp out by being cold and just shunning him immediately as he also seemed to speak for some teammates.   This is one aspect I absolutely dislike about LvG but hopefully he doesn't use this a start of more shit stirring and all. That's also why it's good he's on a shorter term deal as these things could easily escalate or so based on his trend at every single club he was at before too except AZ maybe."
reddevils,3dtgob,Feezbull,3,Sun Jul 19 09:55:07 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the Carrick thing is because Carrick was still very good  last season, whereas RvP really wasn't. Plus he sat down and had the same talk he did with Carrick that he did with RvP at the end of the season."
reddevils,3dtgob,007Hamez,0,Sun Jul 19 10:08:57 2015 UTC,"Well of course that plays a part but, he didn't start to alienate Carrick now did he? Because he's his vice captain now as well. And Carrick honestly has what, one season left as a starter at most due to age and his legs? So it's not too different in that aspect of longevity if you get my point.   The way LvG works seems to be establishing good links to the club core players and then, for the others, it depends I suppose. He doesn't fall out with everyone of course but he wouldn't hesitate to just push them out if he wants to it seems over the course of his career."
reddevils,3dtgob,xtfftc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:14:26 2015 UTC,I'm sure Schweini would be a good option for vice captain when Carrick is out.
reddevils,3dtgob,wharsmetoothpicson,2,Sun Jul 19 11:30:57 2015 UTC,That's likely Smalling now I think though don't you? Seems like LvG rates him as a leader.
reddevils,3dtgob,hamster_army,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:06:59 2015 UTC,"Sorry man I haven't seen any proof or heard of any facts that could even remotely substantiate truth to your suggestion LvG has deliberately pushed out RvP. And your claim it would be because this way LvG can show he is tough and can get on the side of the british core of the ManUtd players and so establish his standing in the dressing room which would make it easier for him beggars belief.  If anything it (RvP's leaving ManUtd) makes LvG life at ManUtd more difficult. Because although LvG might have told RvP he will likely be his 2nd or 3rd choice striker it still would be good to have him in the squad especially when also Falcao left and Wilson and Januzay aren't the finished product yet. But what makes it even more difficult for him is that all the LvG doubters will come out and go ""I told you so"", all the press will run this stories for days and not to forget RvP will not miss any opportunity to put the blame totally on LvG which might just as well lead to loosing the british core of players because they might take over the ""wtf LvG you're ruining our club""  idea of some nervous fans.  To me it shows great courage that he nevertheless told RvP what his plans are and if RvP then chooses to go for the Turkish Lira's that's to bad but he had to be honest about the prospects for RvP.    If LvG was so keen on having the british core on his side then why did he buy memphis, schneiderlin, blind, schweinsteiger, Darmian? If you would now reason that there are no british alternatives that are better then this also goes for RvP. There is no better british alternative available so if there's another striker to be bought he will not be british so how would that get LvG better established with the british core? Also LvG had the nerve to play Rooney as a midfielder. In the press it got him shit loads of critique but nevertheless he persisted with his experiment quit a while. Yet you come here claiming LvG is trying to suck up to the british core of the players or the board or the dressing room or whatever.  If you're not to fond of LvG that's fine and up to you but inventing stuff like this...I don't know man but I don't buy it."

He clearly wasnt rdy to play next fiddle so its his choice im pretty sure van Gaal had no problems keeping him as backup striker.   The whole playing alone thing also hes done that to Shaw as well cause he wasnt fit enough if i remember correctly. He sad something similar about van Persie at the end of the season. He wants to train at 100% no exceptions.   I love van Persie already from when he played at feyenoord and even from his  time before that, the guy is immensly talented but hes got a very big ego as well."

reddevils,3dtt4e,wharsmetoothpicson,62,Sun Jul 19 11:51:17 2015 UTC,"I'm 43 years old and started following United in 1991. I was 19 and had dropped out of college here in the U.S. I moved to Manchester with friends who had been on exchange, mainly because I was obsessed with the music scene there. I got taken to OT by one of my flatmates for the United - Liverpool match. I stood in the enclosure next to the Stretford End. It was a 0-0 draw but I was hooked. Giggs was 17 and absolutely mesmerized me with his runs down the wing. OT was one level, with a corrugated tin roof. You could still stand in the ends, and the threat of violence was everywhere around the game and the city at that time. United were doing well, competing for the title (which they hadn't won in 23 years) and had won the Cup Winners Cup in the spring. I saw Atletico knock them out in the fall, but Fergie was starting to work his ways into the club  and there was an air of excitement around the city.   Back then, Football was still mainly a working class sport and was, for the most part, looked down on by polite society. This was particularly true up North. English teams had been banned in Europe after the Heysel disaster, and had regressed as a result. There were hardly any foreign players in the league at that time, certainly not like it is now. Cantona was at Leeds, and he seemed exotic and brutal, a French anomaly who was impossibly suited to the English game. It was a much rougher and more physical sport than it is now.   Everything changed after Euro 96. England hosted the tournament, and actually did quite well. The nation went football crazy, and suddenly it was fashionable among the media savvy middle classes in London to go to matches. This led to the gigantic influx of money and ubiquitous coverage of the Premiership that we take for granted today. It also resulted in the sanitization of the working class culture I associated with United.   Since then, it's just gotten bigger and bigger. The influx of oil money and the comical rise of City (still pathetic and obsessed with United despite the riches) has just been an extension of the post 96 cash culture around the game. Overall, football is so much more safe, clean and popular than it was back in the time I started going. I make it over to OT from the states every few years, and it's completely unrecognizable compared to the ground I went to in 91. Mostly for the better, but it does feel like it lost some of the character that made it seem dangerous and exciting as a naive 19 year old American middle class kid living in Rusholme."

Everything changes eventually but it's down to the individual whether you embrace new things or try to deny it and fight against it. It doesn't matter if you're old or young, if you respect the history of the club and the players that play for your team then that's the main thing. My biggest gripe about 'fans' is their eagerness to shit on the people that aren't doing so well. I understand criticism is important in any walk of life but there's a vast line between trying to understand why someone isn't doing so well and calling them shit and not actually adding anything than 'get out of the club'."

Unfortunately his return to form was never to be, but I find it disgusting and very embarrassing to be associated with fans who boo and take the piss out of Cleverley, Evans, Nani etc. Christ, I remember a few years ago when people were adamant that Carrick was shit, just because he didn't score many goals."

What does annoy me a bit is how some people only really talk the Premier League years.   Well, how else are people going to talk about it. If there's not many born prior to that point then it's silly them trying to discuss so it's better to leave it at that. It's like when people judge a Pele or Maradona based on YouTube videos, but it's all they know of them. The same applies for pre Premier League times.

What about the other 100 odd years?  The answer is that it is still fucking us."
reddevils,3dtt4e,ReflectingGod,8,Sun Jul 19 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"I'm coming up 31, supported properly since I was 15. We've had ups and downs, lulls and dips but United has mainly stayed the same with the winning mentality. The Arsenal rivalry years were great, both clubs really fucking hated each other in equal measure and every game where we played them there was a scuffle happening somewhere.            The club really hasn't changed from how we go about things (mostly) where we go out to win the game, it doesn't matter who we play, we expect to do well and win. This is why Moyes was almost crucified for even suggesting Liverpool were the favorites to win at Old Trafford, the mentality is still there to be the best team.         Press attitudes to us haven't changed, they still hate us, every loss is a dramatic collapse, every defeat is coughed out like cud and chewed over - last season they were talking about our 'defensive frailties' right to the bitter end despite us having 3rd least conceded goals in the league. Oh and they still conjure up total bollocks on transfer windows, but that will never stop. I remember the press going nuts and inventing a huge story about how City stole Robinho away from us in a daring 11th hour raid - despite us never showing the smallest shite of interest in him.         Younger fans learn over time to roll with the punches of loss and success, I don't care how young or old someone is as long as they aren't whiny fucks who spend more time bashing the team's mistakes than celebrating the good things that make you a supporter of the best fucking club in the world.  Oh the whole young fans are great, you can't have a football club just for old gits."

I was more into my Sega Megadrive, Game Gear and Sonic the Hedgehog etc before 94.   I essentially knew nothing but success for United, although our youth policy isn't as fruitful as it was in the 90's I feel we are making the right moves to compete and get us back to where we are supposed to be. Then we can be a bit more adventurous with youth prospects.   In regards to younger fans I welcome all with open arms. I'm not into preaching about how they should read up on our club's history etc because this is something you'll encounter and enquire about in your own time as you become immersed in the club. If you are a true fan of football and United, reading about our rich history will just happen without an older fan like me nagging you to do it. Just enjoy it."

I was crazy for Brian Robson and went out and bought some New Balance boots the day after.  In terms of changes, the move away from the academy has been a disappointment in recent years. I was sad to see Welbeck leave and I don't see the youngsters getting the same opportunities the 92 got. It'll probably not return until the money runs out.  At 32 I still class myself as a young fan, so can't really answer that, but I'll be taking my sons with me in a few years. New fans are future of any club."

It was just before Giggs came on the scene and it was actually Lee Sharpe who was the young hope for the future (and the player all the girls fancied). Being a teenager and getting to watch the Class of 1992 develop was a privilege.   I stopped watching football a few years ago - partially because I was fed up with the rise of diving and cheating in the English game and partially because I no longer had Sky TV - but I've grown to love it again. Schweinsteiger really excites me because he (weirdly) reminds me of Scholes. He's so comfortable on the ball you don't get nervous when he's in a tight spot. The last few years I think we've been forced to field players that weren't comfortable on the ball and it was painful to watch at times. I think this is about to change and I'm looking forward to watching the new team develop!  The strange thing is that I could have easily been an Arsenal supporter. I have an older brother who started supporting them and I would have just followed his lead, but he said I wasn't allowed to support his team. I should probably thank him!"

I am in denial about my age even though I know it's not 'that old'.   I'll edit in a couple things. Back when I first got into United I couldn't really watch any of the games since I live in the US, so I subscribed to magazines and basically read about them. I remember catching an occasional game and being really excited about it. I became a fan because my dad grew up in Manchester and is a supporter. We visited his family in 1995 and that's when I got really into it. I was playing pretty seriously at the time and through the rest of the 90s/early 2000s so the sport in general was a bit of an obsession. My favorite player as a kid was Giggs."

reddevils,3dtt4e,Mrgerken7,4,Sun Jul 19 14:58:07 2015 UTC,"Over 30.  When I was a kid the only football on TV (New Zealand) was a one hour highlights package which was a week delayed.  Newspaper results of scores in Monday's paper were even wrong most of the time.  The extended TV highlights were always of the bigger sides.  Back then Liverpool was on top and when kids played football at lunch they pretended they were Kevin Keegan, Graeme Souness or Kenny Dalglish.  It was a long time between the 77 and 83 FA Cup wins.  The 1990 season FA Cup saved Alex's job.  I supported the underdog that could actually be watched on TV.  Steve Coppell was my favourite player when I was a kid.  Ironically later working in England and living in Forest Hill (London) he was managing Crystal Palace up the road.  I have seen United play live including having to be low key at the wrong end in a Fulham FA Cup match.  I have had hundreds of 3am wakeups to watch United on TV and lots of weird late night trips to find a bar showing them in Asia.  I paid about 1 pound for a plastic seat and 2 beers on the footpath to watch them in TV a few months back while in Vietnam.  Everything changed with the premiership and the additional spending ability.  We had good success in the mid eighties but it all took off again with the Premier League.

My (Mancunian) Dad was a massive Red and he 'forced' me and my sisters into supporting United.  24 years of going regularly and the club is in some ways unrecognisable to the one I started supporting, yet also there's a consistency in approach and ethos that still runs through the club. That's the continuity of approach going back to Busby through Charlton, Ferguson and Giggs and others too.   The commercialism is the biggest change - but United were the spearhead of that change in English (and probably worldwide) football. We were ahead of the game and that has helped keep us as one of the successful teams of the last 24 years. So although we complain about it at times we have to acknowledge it has become so entrenched in the progress of the club that we need it.   Younger fans - they complain more, and don't have any patience. But I think that's just symptomatic of being young. Younger fans find it easy to know more about the team and the players. The obsessive childhood fan, that I was, aren't as common now. It took a lot more to find everything out about the club and the players. Now everything is available online.

Got me hooked. The World Cup sending off of Beckham also helped me become a fan of United, since I could totally see myself doing something like that which made me sympathize with Beckham, and United by association. It also helped that United had one of their greatest ever season the next year.  Being from India, back then the premier league wasn't as popular as it is now. We didn't really get that many matches on the TV, but, they showed a few United games here and there. I finally got to see a match at Old Trafford this past year, and it was one of the greatest things ever!  Many Indian fans got on board with the EPL during the Invincibles season, hence why we have so many Arsenal fans back there.

My dad still gets teary eyed when he talks about the look on my face, holding his hand and taking in the sheer enormity and noise of an evening game at Old Trafford.   We won 1-0 due to a Kanchelskis goal, and I have looked for it for ages on YouTube but it's never come up. Maybe a Kanchelskis compilation or sommat will have it in.   It may be rose tinted spectacles but I feel like the ground has got quieter as it got bigger over the years. The atmosphere outside the ground has become way more family friendly, it used to be police horses snapping at you and herding you like cattle. The current United teams are more skillful, but I would murder to have someone like Mark Hughes playing for us again. A hero of a man, all grit and explosive power. Old Trafford was a lot more rough around the edges but had a lovely charm to it back then.  A few random memories. :)"

And losing or drawig frequently to shitty teams sucked. Last year was a lot better. The games were actually entertaining to watch, and I got used to expecting to see a win, as opposed to expecting a loss or draw.  I hope you guys don't write me off for being young. I became a United fan in a stereotypical way (I wanted a 5 star team on FIFA). But since then I've stuck with the team, even though my first year watching matches was one of our worst PL years ever. In a few weeks I'll be going to my second match. This subreddit is also the one I come to most."
reddevils,3dtt4e,Twoezy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:49:29 2015 UTC,"It's pretty interesting that people became fans through video games. I was really into gaming as a kid but I was already a Utd fan before the FIFA series even started though I guess if I had been born a little later I might have become a fan that way as well.   The Moyes year was tough but I sort of expected it in a way, when Fergie announced his 1st retirement in 2001 our form completely nose-dived at the time even though he was still there so I wasn't surprised once he left there would be big problems. But we should be right in the mix this season again."
reddevils,3du69a,MrFlaminBrownie,49,Sun Jul 19 14:37:20 2015 UTC,Levy thinks he's the big shot all this while when people want to buy from Spurs. He hasn't met Woodward yet.

reddevils,3du69a,gleek_master,0,Sun Jul 19 16:56:42 2015 UTC,"Well my comment was perched on the hypothetical anyway: I do not want or intend for us to sell Dave. Lloris is not my ideal back up, but getting him for cheaper and offloading Hernandez (sic Levy) is what would more than likely happen.   I don't want Kane, don't want Lloris, and frankly hate dealing with Levy/Spurs. Downvote away"
reddevils,3du69a,MylesVE,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:07:03 2015 UTC,Really? Cause Lloris would be my first choice (from real targets) and I wouldn't mind Kane either.   Fuck Levy though.

reddevils,3du69a,p0wnager,2,Sun Jul 19 14:57:05 2015 UTC,I don't think we should sell him unless we have another striker coming in. I can't see Spurs giving us a decent sum or letting Kane or Loris go to us

reddevils,3dtdl1,TheAwakened,104,Sun Jul 19 07:09:26 2015 UTC,A win win if I've ever seen one.   We keep Di Maria and PSG go after KdB possibly snatching him away from City or at the very least drive his price up.
reddevils,3dtdl1,beet--farm,15,Sun Jul 19 07:14:23 2015 UTC,True but it also means we have a player who doesn't want to be at the club
reddevils,3dtdl1,wharsmetoothpicson,26,Sun Jul 19 09:25:30 2015 UTC,"If Di Maria wants to go that badly he can hand in a transfer request and United will let him go. I'm hoping that all the reports saying that he wants to go are all wrong - after all, journalists love picking on Manchester United"
reddevils,3dtdl1,potato_war_lord,4,Sun Jul 19 10:55:36 2015 UTC,"Well he'll already have told the club if he wants to leave, a transfer request won't really change the situation other than drive down the price PSG are willing to pay which will probably make it less likely he'll be allowed to go."
reddevils,3dtdl1,wharsmetoothpicson,7,Sun Jul 19 11:21:47 2015 UTC,My understanding is that there are normally a number of bonuses that the player is no longer entitled to compensation for if they hand in a written transfer request.
reddevils,3dtdl1,Duffstuff123,3,Sun Jul 19 13:45:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's a lot of factors involved. Not to mention players are very aware of their own PR these days and transfer requests aren't good PR."
reddevils,3dtdl1,wharsmetoothpicson,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:42 2015 UTC,"I'd imagine it would save us money on having to pay out a loyalty bonus, that's usually waived if they hand in a request."

reddevils,3dtdl1,PreztoElite,2,Mon Jul 20 05:38:07 2015 UTC,Not really. He's only reportedly unhappy with life in Manchester. A season is a long time. They could settle in. Might get over that break in. And if United win a trophy actually might enjoy the football too. Will feel more love from our fans and could emerge an overall happier player. There is seriously no harm in keeping him
reddevils,3dtdl1,rogues69,80,Sun Jul 19 15:07:10 2015 UTC,"Good, I hope we maintain that stance. PSG can afford to pay that kind of money for him. We ain't running a charity where we take a £15-18 million hit on a world class player after 1 season."

The Belgian international could win a place on PSG's transfer list, say L'Equipe, but it's thought he'd prefer a move to the Premier League or La Liga, otherwise there's little point him leaving Wolfsburg other than money.    Why is the NEWSPAPER looking at alternatives."

reddevils,3dtdl1,RestrepoMU,5,Sun Jul 19 07:11:28 2015 UTC,"In the article it says we want all the money we paid though, so it's a bit conflicting."

reddevils,3dtdl1,Jujux,6,Sun Jul 19 07:50:04 2015 UTC,Surely we should be asking for more then?
reddevils,3dtdl1,obadetona,2,Sun Jul 19 10:11:24 2015 UTC,"I doubt he's worth as much now as he was then, so for us to only lose £8 mill on him isn't too bad if he wants to go. Especially when it's not a good time for European clubs to be buying from us (because Euro) , getting that much money is a decent deal. We won't get £60m."

reddevils,3dtdl1,StannisJr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:37:46 2015 UTC,that is a massive loss with his wages aswell surely
reddevils,3dtdl1,ynwa-mike,12,Sun Jul 19 15:31:51 2015 UTC,Whats more worying to me is that Di Maria apparently has made a pesonal agreement with PSG. If thats true (which remains a big if) his heart clearly isnt with us and he should be sold.
reddevils,3dtdl1,Zico568,21,Sun Jul 19 07:47:46 2015 UTC,"Only for £52m though, not a penny lower."
reddevils,3dtdl1,StannisJr,5,Sun Jul 19 07:50:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed not saying we should lower the price, but if thats true he should be going out other sources seem to suggest we still want to keep him. I think thats a bad idea if his heart is not here."
reddevils,3dtdl1,Zico568,2,Sun Jul 19 08:00:05 2015 UTC,"Well, he did say last year he wanted to go to PSG. No point having players here who think they don't have to put effort in. I don't understand why ADM didn't just stay at RM if he didn't want to come here. Also, why choose PSG over Manchester United? Doesn't make sense."
reddevils,3dtdl1,StannisJr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:07:50 2015 UTC,From what I understood PSG couldnt get him because of FFP rules. He might have been desperate to leave Madrid and decided to take a chance on us after the PSG deal fell through.
reddevils,3dtdl1,Zico568,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:28:24 2015 UTC,"That's annoying but fair enough I guess. But I'm not sure why he'd be desperate to leave, I think I read somewhere he wanted better wages."
reddevils,3dtdl1,StannisJr,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:31:42 2015 UTC,Well im hoping this is just speculation from the press since they often don't have a clue and just like to make things up. I think though these rumors coming from reasonably reliable sources so can't help to think there must be some truth to it. Also van Gaal not directly ruling out him leaving worries me a bit. Even though he wants to keep him but he's also said its Di Maria's choice if he wants to be here.  Edit: my horrible grammar
reddevils,3dtdl1,Zico568,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:40:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when he's saying ""it's a process"" that doesn't give me confidence either."

reddevils,3dtdl1,Zico568,4,Sun Jul 19 09:05:29 2015 UTC,"If that's true it is a bit like the Sterling situation,the only difference being that Di Maria's agent is not being a knob.If Liverpool have gotten 49 million pounds for Sterling then no way United should  budge and accept less than 59-60 million pounds for Di Maria IMO."
reddevils,3dtdl1,goto_man,2,Sun Jul 19 08:14:04 2015 UTC,"Di Maria is better than Sterling, but not worth as much to City. The reason they wanted him is because he is English and they barely have enough homegrown players to put a squad together. Liverpool knew this and could play hardball.  I'm in favour of us trying to get a good price, but we aren't in such a position of power.  Personally I'm crossing fingers that they balk at the price, we keep him and he learns to love Manchester. But if he goes it's not the end of the world."
reddevils,3dtdl1,diracnotation,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:36:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed about not budging theres enough suiters id say, would be really disappointed if Di Maria didn't really want to be here though and i think hes the sort of player where you will see his results will suffer from it."
reddevils,3dtdl1,Zico568,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:33:57 2015 UTC,"I too don't want him to leave.I just don't understand why he is still thinking about his 1st season with United with a negative perspective. It's not like the PL is an easy league to adjust to immediately.He had an above average 1st season in the PL IMO, which is actually decent considering the fact that the PL is always a tough league to adjust to, for the newcomers from the other European leagues. He should be motivated to perform well during the upcoming season instead of trying to leave United IMO."
reddevils,3dtdl1,goto_man,3,Sun Jul 19 09:04:41 2015 UTC,I know I totally agree with you id be very disappointed in Di Maria and it would show a lot about his character if he didn't man up.
reddevils,3dtdl1,Zico568,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:08:03 2015 UTC,"Totally agree!! I still think he won't leave but if he does leave, it would clearly show that he has a very weak mentality."

reddevils,3dtdl1,GoatBass,2,Sun Jul 19 10:37:33 2015 UTC,"I think a professional like Di Maria knows that if he doesn't give his 100%, his market value and demand will drop which means a club like PSG won't be interested any longer."

I still believe Blind has the quality to become a first team player. People have already relegated him to being a utility man, when he has been one of our best players last year IMO."
reddevils,3dts6x,DelusionalThomas666,32,Sun Jul 19 11:56:26 2015 UTC,It's because Blind hasn't got the star attitude or playstyle and people always want the big names on the team sheet. Realistically Blind was better at LB than Shaw last year but Shaw was bought for 30 million so people automatically think he's better.
reddevils,3dts6x,Muppetx,45,Sun Jul 19 13:38:07 2015 UTC,"But Shaw could be so much better. He was nearly creating something every time he was on the ball.  Blind is a very good LB, but I think Shaw could easily become one of the very best."
reddevils,3dts6x,Hassi94,6,Sun Jul 19 13:45:12 2015 UTC,"Yes Shaw could be better and he's better at running at defenders but his end product was often lacking. Blind doesn't run at a defender often or overlap often but when he does, often times he puts in a good cross."
reddevils,3dts6x,Muppetx,6,Sun Jul 19 13:48:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I feel that very often Shaw put a great ball into the box that someone else fucked up. His decision making isn't as good as Blind's but that comes with time. Shaw has great defensive awareness and fantastic technical ability and pace. With time he's sure to become a much better LB than Blind."
reddevils,3dts6x,Hassi94,5,Sun Jul 19 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think Shaw has 'great' defensive awareness, he just had the pace to make up for it. Against Club America there was a particular moment when all our defenders bar Shaw took a step towards the halfway line for the offside trap and because Shaw didn't, he played an attacker onside.   I think he will be better than Blind with more years of experience aswell but there isn't anything that says that's 100% sure and for the time being I think Blind is better."
reddevils,3dts6x,Muppetx,2,Sun Jul 19 14:13:34 2015 UTC,"I think people have in general accepted that Shaw's season was not the best. Still, he is a long-term purchase, and was very good at LB when he was fit, so it's perfectly normal to want to see him start."
reddevils,3dts6x,xtfftc,0,Sun Jul 19 13:55:12 2015 UTC,"Well, parts of that post is nonsense. Blind was certainly better than Shaw at LB last season, but Shaw has the attributes and potential to go on and become a world beater, and I see him as our long term LB.  In centre mid he did a good job in some games, but there were plenty of games where the match seemed to pass him by, and the difference between him and Carrick in that position was monumental. He's a tidy player who reads the game fairly well but he's incredibly slow, and doesn't have the passing range to be great in that position.  But no, let's just assume people don't like him because he's less glamorous than other players because that's easier and a lot lazier."
reddevils,3dts6x,iceman58796,2,Sun Jul 19 20:31:20 2015 UTC,"Intelligence and quick passing over speed and power i'd say. But it really is a matter of interpretation. I know muppetx is dutch and so am I and in NL we prefer a different type of player then what british people expect from a, in this case, LB. We tend to go by the saying ""nobody is faster then the ball"". Which means that with a well performed (enough speed, accuracy and optimized use of available space) passing game and good positioning you'll out play the fastest/strongest players. Every LB makes mistakes also shaw but it seems that if Blind makes the mistake people go ""I told you so, blind isn't a proper LB"". But the crucial difference in the LvG idea of football lies in how are they performing when we are in possession of the ball and we have to build up the game from behind. In that aspect of the game Blind absolutely has more to offer then Shaw, I think."
reddevils,3dts6x,007Hamez,4,Sun Jul 19 21:38:19 2015 UTC,"Was he decent against Club America?   From what I can remember he was caught out of position several times in that game, IMO drawn out to the left or up into the midfield far too often.  Don't get me wrong, he's played well for us since joining, but I really think he doesn't have the defensive awareness, let alone the build or height to excel at CB."

reddevils,3dts6x,mynjo,3,Sun Jul 19 12:06:28 2015 UTC,Can't imagine Blind playing in goal. I still think if Dave leaves we should get big John back in for keeper
reddevils,3dts6x,TMillo,6,Sun Jul 19 12:31:17 2015 UTC,In all seriousness O' Shea was commanding against mid table teams and never looked out of place up against European giants. Blind shits the bed twice a match against Crystal Palace.  For all his intelligence and triangles etc. he has a lot of errors in him. He's only looked good at LB during that 5 match stretch of form.
reddevils,3dts6x,inu50kza,13,Sun Jul 19 12:25:59 2015 UTC,Everyone can have a bad day at the office of course. His bouncing blond locks make up for everything.  The season before Carrick arrived when giggs and oshea were in midfield they were phenomenal.
reddevils,3dts6x,mynjo,-4,Sun Jul 19 13:14:49 2015 UTC,"I'm basing this off a year's worth of performances. Even for the Dutch NT most fans get upset when he plays because he's a step below the rest of the players.   He's been slated before apparently with Ajax where most thought he wasn't good enough and then switched positions to CM and won their POTY trophy so hopefully he steps his game up but I'm not going to hold my breath.   I think he's just a loyal servant and a manager's favourite which is important to have to maintain authority but he's not even my 3rd choice for LCB or holding midfielder.   I'd much rather play Rojo, Evans or any of the RCBs there. I'd much rather play Carrick, Morgan or Bastian at DM.  I don't mind him playing LB but if Shaw can improve his positioning I'd rather he start at LB. I think Rojo's probably my 2nd choice LB over Blind as well for the bigger fixtures."
reddevils,3dts6x,inu50kza,5,Sun Jul 19 13:24:52 2015 UTC,"and never looked out of place up against European giants   O'Shea is one of my favourite United players and I'm very biased when the likes of him and Fletcher are mentioned... But still, that was a blatant overstatement. O'Shea was great for us - but he often did look out of place."
reddevils,3dts6x,xtfftc,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:08 2015 UTC,"Out of place in the sense that 1v1 against Figo he'd lose out over the course of the match but he'd give him a good fight. Several games he got the better of Drogba even though Drogba probably came out on top 60% of the time.  He was technically solid, athletic and read the game intelligently. He didn't do too many spectacular things but made few mistakes.   That's all I can ask of a utility man who starts 20-30 matches a season.  Blind can get overrun by some fairly average players and would get shredded over and over if you put him up against Suarez or Ribery."
reddevils,3dts6x,inu50kza,2,Sun Jul 19 14:05:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, agreed completley on O'Shea.  As for Blind though... O'Shea had limited ability but Fergie's teams were well-coordinated. Van Gaal and Blind have only had a season so far, so it's a bit early to say. Yes, Blind did not impress but was good enough considering how the rest of the team played, so I'm hoping that as the squad improves, so will he."
reddevils,3dts6x,xtfftc,0,Sun Jul 19 14:16:26 2015 UTC,Oh for fuck's sake you must be kidding. Are you really trying to say John O'Shea is better than Blind? Saying Blind was only good at left back during that 5 match stretch of form? Blind was also good in many home games and even against Arsenal at the end of the season.   You lot are so fucking overcritical of Blind it's ridiculous. Watch him surprise you like he did surprise everyone at Ajax and then you'll probably come out and say you had always rated him. God people on this sub have the memory of a 90 year old with dementia sometimes.
reddevils,3dts6x,Muppetx,2,Sun Jul 19 17:45:56 2015 UTC,"Are you really trying to say John O'Shea is better than Blind?   Yes and it's not even close. Blind may grow into the role but he's done nothing to suggest he's better right now.  Like you said due to his lack of athleticism and confidence/adjustment issues his mistakes are more glaring when he makes a jump to a higher level of football but even after being seen as a joke and subject of derision at Ajax he reinvented himself and became their POTY.   He's a clever player, he may step up another gear this season.   Though based on what I've seen I'd rather play Rojo, Evans or any of the RCBs at LCB over him. I'd rather play Carrick, Schweini or Schneiderlin over him in midfield. He's been better at LB when we have a lot of possession and are up against a parked bus but against any decent attack I'd rather have Rojo. I think he's been better than Shaw but he doesn't have the pace to play fullback permanently."
reddevils,3dts6x,inu50kza,105,Sun Jul 19 19:20:22 2015 UTC,"Oh God, no!"
reddevils,3dts6x,aman27deep,24,Sun Jul 19 11:40:38 2015 UTC,"I wonder if people actually read/understand what LVG says.    Asked whether Blind would play more games at centre-back next season, Van Gaal replied: “It could be, it could be.  “Marcos Rojo is not here, he shall come on July 25. I want to play always with a left-footed central defender and he can do the job. Maybe he shall play. But other players can play there.   IF we see Blind as a CB, it's only when Rojo is injured. Other than that, Rojo will always be our CB because he's left footed and Van Gaal prefers to play with a LCB and RCB. That doesn't mean Blind will be a starter or anything. We even played with Jones and Smalling(they're both right footed) at the end of last season because Rojo was injured. And for what it's worth: I think van Gaal also suggests with this that if/when he gets a new CB, he will most likely be right footed"

reddevils,3dts6x,LucaRiolu493,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"No idea, I cannot pretend to follow anyone else but United. However, my question was how is van Gaal suggesting that he will be signing a RCB since he has more players suitable for the position and it's LCB that he is lacking."
reddevils,3dts6x,xtfftc,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:07:56 2015 UTC,"You're right in questioning that, he wasn't suggesting that UNLESS we assume he thinks Rojo is his best centre back and it is in fact Smalling/Jones who need to be replaced with a better defender. But that's not consistent with what we saw towards the end of the season so I think he will buy a LCB"

reddevils,3dts6x,Jhix,2,Sun Jul 19 11:51:00 2015 UTC,"Well thanks, then the title is misleading."
reddevils,3dts6x,SomebodyReasonable,8,Sun Jul 19 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"Memphis Depay in the centre of the pitch instead of playing out wide, Blind at CB, weird 4-4-2 formation.. Hope these kind of experiments will end when PL starts."
reddevils,3dts6x,edmontom,5,Sun Jul 19 12:07:38 2015 UTC,tbh the preseason is the best place for experiments like these. I'd rather he do them now and gain some insight rather than do them during the season.
reddevils,3dts6x,defyingsanity,3,Sun Jul 19 12:49:11 2015 UTC,"And I thought that last season was the time for experiments (3-5-2 etc). This time we should start playing with 4-3-3 formation from the first game, help form on-pitch relationships between players, improve automatism, not change players positions, and experiment with new formations. I don't recall Mourinho experimenting with Matic playing as Centre Back, or Hazard as CAM in preseason games. And later during the season it shows."
reddevils,3dts6x,edmontom,3,Sun Jul 19 13:03:09 2015 UTC,"The example you gave doesn't comply here. Mou doesn't have a better DM so he's not gonna experiment with Matic anywhere else. He also did plenty of experimenting in competitive games like not playing with a striker, he actually played Hazard as a CAM with Oscar on the right and he played Zouma and Cahill as DMs when Matic was injured or suspended .  LVG does plenty of experimenting  until he finds the best output from the players he has so it's something you'll have to get used to, I'm pretty sure he'll find 4-3-3 best overall but he also has to experiment for alternative tactics if plan A doesn't work."
reddevils,3dts6x,BigCheeser,2,Sun Jul 19 13:24:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Chelsea didn't have the issue of rebuilding a team pretty much from the ground up. We barely had a proper midfield at times last year. Chelsea doesn't have to figure out how to deal with reentering CL and needing to develop depth in positions to prevent injury crises.   Our team is different this year (imo, Chelsea's midfield hasn't changed as much as ours has over the past 2 years) and simply trying things in training is not going to cut it. The real season hasn't even started yet, how do we know that LVG is going to keep experimenting this season as well? I think the large portion of his experiments are going to be done with preseason, but if we have late signings, he's going to have to try them out as well. I trust the man to know what he's doing lol"
reddevils,3dts6x,defyingsanity,2,Sun Jul 19 13:43:14 2015 UTC,"3-5-2 was not an experiment but a necessity due to the gigantic injury crisis. As soon as it was over, van Gaal switched to four in defence."
reddevils,3dts6x,xtfftc,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:57:14 2015 UTC,We knew when buying that both can do a job centrally and since we have needs in both positions no sense in not trying them out first in preseason and the 442 formation is basically a 4231 which is much better and can be played now thanks to our signings.

reddevils,3dts6x,Zico568,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:32:46 2015 UTC,weird 4-4-2 formation   Many feel this was because he wanted to fit in as many players as he could and 4-4-2 seemed like the best formation to fit everyone in. It allowed him to see how versatile the players are whilst also giving them game time.
reddevils,3dts6x,TheJoshider10,2,Sun Jul 19 13:37:44 2015 UTC,"He won't be anywhere near the starting CB positions next season if everyone's fit, for what it's worth."

reddevils,3dts6x,arrowontheknee,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:37:33 2015 UTC,If our defenders are just as injury prone as last season I would be surprised if he doesn't play some matches as a centre back.
reddevils,3dts6x,Compieuter,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:40:10 2015 UTC,He didn't ooze confidence Saturday morning but I'm sure he could be a good back-up to Rojo.   I personally don't see the problem with playing a right footed centre-back at CLB.
reddevils,3dts6x,Yellow-Eyed-Demon,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:41:19 2015 UTC,"You might not, but if LVG takes serious issue with a right-footed LCB (which he does), you probably won't see it."

reddevils,3dts6x,Hassi94,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:54:53 2015 UTC,Rojo had been injured and Jones/Smalling had developed some chemistry. Don't fix what isn't broken. I don't think it's as vital as others are saying but it's obvious LVG prefers a left footed LCB and right footed RCB for perfect balance.

reddevils,3dts6x,hsd932,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:09:17 2015 UTC,no way ! He's bit slow to react and don't have the attributes required for a good defender. Deploying him in defence in premier league match will be quite a suicidal approach. He's not a good leader and his future lies as a defensive midfielder. So LVG should try to build another Schweini or Carrick from him rather than making him a make-shift player.
reddevils,3dts6x,aravindu43,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:35:55 2015 UTC,"At this point, what IS his natural position? Seeing him play for United, he played in mid, LB and now CB. For Netherlands, I can only remember him at LB.   According to FIFA 15, he's a CDM. Wtf is going on lol."

reddevils,3dts6x,tuananh_org,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:31:07 2015 UTC,"As a LB those might be his strong attributes but as a CB his positioning, anticipation and awareness are not good enough IMO.Playing as a full back is completely different as compared to playing as a CB. A Center Back requires more concentration, better positioning skills and awareness."
reddevils,3dts6x,goto_man,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:14:07 2015 UTC,"He knows better than us I guess. I've always wondered whether Carrick would eventually drop to a CB because of his reading of the game, Blind I guess falls under the same category. That said I can't say he had the greatest of auditions. Had some good moments but also gave away what should have been a stonewaller imo."

reddevils,3dty08,TheJoshider10,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:55 2015 UTC,I think so but it takes like a minute to set up and then from there you just look for HQ streams to do with it and you don't have to go through the horrible ordeal of constant stream crashes and watching games at 10fps in 240p.

It’s an honour to play with such a legend like Wazza.”   Kinda sounds like he's gonna be playing centrally then? or at least that seems to be the idea at this time... if ADM goes or we bring an established ST we might see Memphis go back to the wing I suppose. Or maybe he was just talking about the Club America game and the past tense got lost in translation...
reddevils,3ds4g8,ManUToaster,23,Sat Jul 18 22:57:36 2015 UTC,Maybe he just means build a good winger/ST partnership with Rooney?

reddevils,3ds4g8,mistah_michael,10,Sun Jul 19 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"""We have to form a duo"" big hint that he could be playing in a central role e.g Fellainis position further up the pitch, with 2 of  Schweinsteiger/Carrick/Schneiderlin as CDMs in a double pivot, it would give him much freedom, though I would prefer to see him running at defenders down the wing. (Btw I am aware that LVG usually plays with a single pivot, but with the options available a double might be better, giving our attacking players the chance to really express themselves."
reddevils,3ds4g8,clg93,10,Sat Jul 18 22:59:12 2015 UTC,"Can't see him playing number 10 for a number of reasons.  Surely Mata and Ander are ahead of him in the pecking order if LVG wants to play an advanced mid.  Don't think we'll play a double pivot. LVG loves his 433 with a number 6, I think it'll be Carrick and Schweinsteiger rotating there with Ander and Schneiderlin in front of them."

reddevils,3ds4g8,ritwikjs,3,Sun Jul 19 03:03:44 2015 UTC,"I suspect LVG wants to give Young the chance to keep his starting place at LW so it could well be the case that Depay is moved central.

[Graham Hunter] Van Gaal has hinted that there may be a surprise signing. When asked about whether or not he was worried about a lack of depth up front, he said: “No, because still we have Rooney, he can play in the striker’s position. All the media had written he had to play there so I listened and now you put this question [to me] so I don’t know what you want. Also we have Chicharito [Hernandez] and maybe Wilson and maybe there comes a surprise. It’s a process. Hernandez is coming [to join us on the tour] on July 25. He can prove himself and now Falcao and Van Persie are gone so his chances are better. I’m not worried about that position.” Ed Woodward has flown back home and will now work on addressing Van Gaal’s hopes of signing Pedro and a potential replacement for David De Gea. [Jamie Jackson]  Manchester United are close to signing Sergio Romero. Talks are at an advanced stage, and an agreement is very close. Van Gaal is familiar with Romero, as he coached the goalkeeper for 2 years at AZ Alkmaar. [Sky Italia via Omid Zamani]  When asked about Manchester United, Jasper Cillessen said: ""I have only heard the rumours so I don't worry about it until I hear something from my agent. If I don't hear something from my agent, I enjoy playing at Ajax. I ask my agent, who also is Memphis Depay's, and he says we don't know anything. Of course, it's a great club, Manchester United, but I cannot do anything with rumours.""

reddevils,3ds60w,itsandercontrol,14,Sat Jul 18 23:14:13 2015 UTC,"The Sunday Mirror will tomorrow claim that Manchester United are targetting Bale again. Source: Sky Sports - What the papers are saying.   I doubt there's much too it. From the sounds of it they have taken the word ""surprise"" from LVG and just picked it up, and started running with it without a care in the world. The name Bale probably remains on an overarching list of players MU would be interested in if ever available. I literally imagine a journalist picking up the phone, asking his contact if the word Bale is still on that list, and writing a story about it every few months just because.   Mail on Sunday is reporting that Angel Di Maria will have to hand in a transfer request if he wants to leave. This actually makes sense as LVG has said all along that he can leave if he wants. Without going into the details, whether a player hands in a transfer request or not makes little difference to whether a transfer happens if the club does not want to sell. Depending on contract clauses and whatnot it could mean absolutely zip to the dynamic of the 'process'. If I was Di Maria, I wouldn't see the sense in handing in a transfer request, it's bad publicity.   My opinion on a few other points -   Otamendi - I don't know whether we are interested or not. What I surmise is that he is not a target until Ed & Louie feel that Ramos is dead in the water. So this one might go quiet for a while unless the player/agent continue to fuel it. Which they might not have even done.   Cavani - I hope that's true, as I don't want him.  Romero, Cillessen - Pointless speculation - I don't find it hard to conceive at all that LVG has some sort of informal arrangement with Ajax that we may come in for Cillessen at some point as is being reported. It could be an informal agreement, or it could be that LVG told Frank de Boer - oi, BTW, keep an eye on the de Gea situation because if I so chose, I'm going to buy Cillessen whenever I dam please. I think any goalkeeper chat is irrelevant until De Gea is sold. Which I'm increasingly hopeful doesn't happen. 100% fan of letting him run his contract out if that's what it comes to.   Pedro - some conflicting reports over what his buyout clause situation is. Reports that 22m (or whatever arbitary figure in the 20s) isn't a buyout clause, it's a sum that if offered, Barcelona should inform Pedro that an offer has been made. (Similar to the Suarez situation, where scummy Liverpool claimed it wasn't a buyout clause, it was only a 'we'll let you know that someones bid that for you Luis but doesn't actual mean anything') Also claims that the clause only becomes a binding buy out clause if he plays less that 60% of MINUTES for Barca in 15/16, making it more relevant for next transfer window. The details of the clause will be the difference between whether Barca have to let him go if he wants, or whether they have complete control.   Now, whether Manchester United are in for him or not is difficult to know. What's likely is that given the speculation, contact has been made by United to find out the situation so they can make an informed decision. Pedro has also said he does have offers so we can probably assume Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and City have probably done the same thing, and told Barca they are likely to make an official offer or made official offers. (Again, dependant on the contract clauses/Barca's attitude).   I personally just don't see how Chelsea don't win this race, he has to start every game for them. I only want him if Di Maria leaves - and only just because of the opportunity cost of Chelsea missing out on him would override my desire to see Adnan, Pereira, Lindgard, Januzaj get minutes."
reddevils,3ds60w,superironthorman,2,Sun Jul 19 00:47:08 2015 UTC,"With De Gea I now full believe he told the club he wants to go back to Spain so he will not resign a contract, but he has also said that he will fufill his contract and is happy to play another season at United. Obviously this is clear speculation but it makes a lot of sense with all the rumours"

As it stands we only have two clear strikers, and one can argue that Wilson isn't really ready to make the step up.  There is also a very obvious drought in the amount of available strikers we could buy at this point.  Considering the sudden change in quality in our midfield, maybe Hernandez's poaching abilities can come in handy."
reddevils,3dr8py,Calimariae,28,Sat Jul 18 18:19:26 2015 UTC,I agree with this. The team is set for a poacher type player more than I can recall in any recent season. Plus he's still quite a fast little guy and good at keeping the last defender honest.

He simply has to because right now our only options are our captain or essentially a reserve player. 2 strikers isn't enough for the whole season, but then again I also don't think Hernandez is enough. I hope we can sign a world class striker by the end of the window because we still need that quality in depth."
reddevils,3dr8py,TheJoshider10,15,Sat Jul 18 18:23:12 2015 UTC,"Chicharito and Rooney are enough, especially if Memphis is a potential striker candidate too. In my opinion, our money would be better spent elsewhere"
reddevils,3dr8py,JTRut,7,Sat Jul 18 19:17:15 2015 UTC,And Fellaini will probably be used up top this season as well now that the midfield gaps have been plugged.

reddevils,3dr8py,irish_sa,5,Sat Jul 18 19:47:19 2015 UTC,He's good at what he does (long balls) but that's just not the type of team we are. I hope he isn't still in LVG's best XI.
reddevils,3dr8py,dj0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:47:49 2015 UTC,"As he should, I think, but not as a plan A starter. We've got arguably the best midfield for a good few years and if they're able to play to their creative best and feed Hernandez, he will score goals.   With how expensive strikers are at the moment, it would be good business too."

reddevils,3dsb5w,benji-21,35,Sat Jul 18 23:52:13 2015 UTC,Micky Carrick wasn't near a 7 for me... He was caught in possession a lot.
reddevils,3dsb5w,hardgour,13,Sun Jul 19 00:08:08 2015 UTC,"Blind gets caught out time and again, constantly loses possession and hacks down a guy for a blatant penalty and gets 6.5 Jones constantly out of position, doesn't make a single clean tackle all match and gets a 6.5  Evans is rock solid and our best defender either half by some margin despite having to cover for Blacklett constantly out of position and only gets a 6.  Shaw made one run in the entire 45 mins, had no idea what to do in the opposition half and got tackled. Aside fromt hat he almost gave away a penalty, constantly got caught out of position and on the wrong side of the forward and got a 7.  A lot of these ratings are a bit ridiculous and seem to be written based on someone's prediction of the match rather than how it actually played out.  Schneiderlin 8.5? Schweinsteiger loses the ball once and even then to what was a blatant foul and he gets a lower rating than Morgan?  Darmian was fine but if Valencia made the mistake he made would be absolutely slated by this sub. On attack he wasn't great, barely got on the ball and made 3 passes to nobody. 7.5 is vastly overrating his performance."
reddevils,3dsb5w,inu50kza,5,Sun Jul 19 02:30:03 2015 UTC,I thought Memphis did much better. Some of the one touch passes were very tasty.   I don't agree with quite a few of OPs ratings at all.   Bastian missed an almost sitter and didn't move around the pitch that much but got a 8?
reddevils,3dsb5w,em22new,2,Sun Jul 19 04:42:10 2015 UTC,"Bastian was holding midfielder, he's not going to run up and down the field. Watch the match again, I had bits where I'd just track his movement for 5 mins and his positioning was sublime, always there to receive the pass, always retaining possession.   Mata, Ander, Schneiderlin and Carrick all kept getting knocked off the ball and caught out.  Plus Schweini's flick created the best chance of the match for Januzaj.  Not all action but I thought he was the best midfielder. He reads the play better than Schneiderlin so he has to dive into fewer tackles. He calmed a lot of the end to end manic football we were playing in the first half.   Yeah like I said it's a toss up between Adnan and Memphis. Memphis was more solid all around but had zero end product. Adnan had a few very limp moments where a bit of concentration would have ended up with a goal or assist but he kept making space for himself and others to test the goalkeeper."
reddevils,3dsb5w,inu50kza,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:28:41 2015 UTC,"I agree – I didn't think Memphis looked underwhelming at all. Quite the opposite – very exciting prospect there, especially after saying that he is determined to be under the world-class tutelage of Wayne.  Hope he tries to be a bit more of a clinical forward that Rooney, though, but if we acquire a box fox, he could shape himself to be the next generation Wayne."
reddevils,3dsb5w,blakeseven,0,Sun Jul 19 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"All of the center backs were pretty poor. Yeah, blind shouldn't have a 6.5, but let's not act like evans was some sort of godsend. Smalling was decent though, to his credit, just one or two errant passes."
reddevils,3dsb5w,shtzkrieg,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:21:00 2015 UTC,"Smalling's distribution was shocking, misplaced a lot of simple passes but a definite upgrade on Jones defensively.

reddevils,3dsb5w,Paolarbear,15,Sun Jul 19 00:14:30 2015 UTC,I can't wait to see Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin playing together.
reddevils,3dsb5w,TheJoshider10,0,Sun Jul 19 06:02:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think that will happen very often, only in big games. I his first press conference LvG said that those two and Carrick are competing for the CDM position. I believe that means one of them will be playing with Herrera and probably ADM in midfield."
reddevils,3dsb5w,dertigo,14,Sun Jul 19 00:06:10 2015 UTC,"I love Schweinsteiger and it was great to see him play but i don't think he deserves 8 purely because of the fact that he is a new signing that all United fans are excited about him. He wasn't bad at all, had a solid debut but nothing out of the ordinary of a player of his calibre. Would probably put him down to 7-7.5  Thought Pereira was quite clearly the best man on the field in the second half. Really impressed by him and deserves 8 imo. So confident on the ball, almost scored a really nice goal and played the ball around nicely. Also created a few decent chances like the cross towards Januzaj and the one over the top to McNair."
reddevils,3dsb5w,ZxentixZ,5,Sun Jul 19 02:22:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch the game live... but watched the whole game later. Admittedly, I skipped some parts but I believe the second half performance was better. We were a tad quicker and could have scored atlas two more, had wilson been on point."
reddevils,3dsb5w,AE71,2,Sun Jul 19 00:36:48 2015 UTC,"Schweini dictating play, having a CB capable of distributing the ball in Evans and getting rid of Mata so we had pace to burn helped. Ander kept rushing up as well to add numbers."
reddevils,3dsb5w,inu50kza,4,Sun Jul 19 00:27:32 2015 UTC,I personally thought we did ok.   Still looking for that killer edge someone to take that initiative. But what I like is how fluid we look. God its sliky out there at times.   Personally thought Shaw was amazing. Honestly I think he can easily become the worlds best left back if he stays fit.
reddevils,3dsb5w,Orcnick,3,Sun Jul 19 12:16:35 2015 UTC,"Team of the match.   Only debatable one for me was Januzaj over Depay. Both were creative, wasteful, greedy. Januzaj was a bit limp and lacked a killer instinct but made space to get shots off and test the keeper which Depay didn't do but he had some neat flicks and tricks to lik play.   Also neither Lingard nor Mata were great, Young drifted to the right a few times and was easily a better winger than both RW options.   Slim pickings at LB but it's hard to be worse than Blacklett.                Johnstone Darmian  Smalling  Evans  Shaw Schneiderlin  Schweinsteiger Young                 Pereira       Rooney  Januzaj"

reddevils,3dsb5w,king0elizabeth,2,Sun Jul 19 02:38:47 2015 UTC,"JOHN STONE   I will now call him Memphis. So anyway, Depay just touched the ball.  Blacklett may be the best/worst thing to come out of this preseason. It's not but sounds so racist for so reason."
reddevils,3dsb5w,inu50kza,4,Sun Jul 19 03:11:48 2015 UTC,"Im only going to comment on a few of our players, mostly our new signings but also our younger players. I thought Johnstone had a solid half apart from his distribution. Coming off his line he was very quick and done well even if a few of the calls were offside.      Cant say im to confident with him or Lindegaard  but perhaps that's because i'm used to De Gea and have seen barely any of Johnstone or Lindegaard. If anyone has watched johnstone frequently last season and could give an opinion that would be much appreciated.      Darmian had a very solid half both going forward and tracking back and im confident that with more playing time he will be more in tune with our right side of attack. Schneiderlin also had a very sold half and im very excited to see him next season. He seems to be very confident, composed and strong on the ball allowing himself to win and then find the time to pass the ball along.     Memphis is probably the player i'm most excited in seeing next season and in these coming matches. In the first half, a lot of our chances seemed to come from his flicks or passes. And although he should've passed to young i cant blame him because he is a player full of confidence and clearly wants to impress.     Bastian Schweinsteiger, a player i would never of imagined seeing in a United shirt, brought a smile to my face every time i heard his name. I thought he played very well getting himself out of a number of tricky situations distributing the ball very well apart from a few misplaced or underpowered passes.       Pereira  was in my opinion the most influential player of the second half. A lot of the chances came from his deliveries and if we had more confident strikers i think he wouldve had a couple of assists."

reddevils,3dsb5w,tomas753,4,Sun Jul 19 15:17:32 2015 UTC,Pereira was my favourite - dude can dribble!
reddevils,3dsb5w,Leking9,3,Sun Jul 19 16:33:58 2015 UTC,Evans was our best defender that night
reddevils,3dsb5w,junglenut,4,Sun Jul 19 03:24:00 2015 UTC,I really can't agree in your assessment of Blind. He was all over the place in that backline and was caught out of position so many times. His tackle in the penalty area should have been a penalty as well.
reddevils,3dsb5w,simplyevert,3,Sun Jul 19 03:29:44 2015 UTC,"Disagree with quite  a few of these. I'll tackle them as I see fit:   Jones  and Blind   Blind was for me clearly better than Jones. He had one bad tackle in the box, but was otherwise solid. Jones was rushing into a few situations leaving our defense out of shape, and Blind had to cover for him. I'd either -0,5 Jonesy or +0,5 Blind. Or both.   Luke Shaw - 7   Very generous. He didn't really play bad or anything, but he was barely involved at all. Very anonymous display from him imo.   Jonny Evans - 6   What the fuck.  This place sure doesn't like Jonny. I thought he had an excellent game. Had to play both CB and LB as Blackett was non-existent and out of position all of his time on the pitch. He won every single challenge he was involved in, and looked perhaps our best CB today.   Tyler Blackett - 5.5   A bit generous. don't get me wrong, I like Tyler, but he was horrendous in his half. See above.   Ander Herrera - 6   Bit generous as well. I know he didn't play in his prefered position, but I thought he was really sloppy. Wasted a fair bit of possession and was out of position when Club America went on the break. Hopefully he picks it up in the coming games.   Jesse Lingard - 5.5   Having Jesse lower than Herrera makes no sense to me. He was constantly on the move, picked up the ball in good positions and played it on. Kagawa-esque. Except when Kagawa did it, we gathered in a circle and jerked off. I thought Lingard had a very good appearance for us, and made the right choice every single time on the ball. Tidy and effective, like LvG likes them.   James Wilson - 5.5 and Adnan Januzaj - 6.5   I honestly find it hard to evaluate the pair. They were more or less completely isolated, and we didn't manage to involve them at all. The only ""striker"" we involved during the 90 minutes in that game, was Depay. Rooney, Adnan and Willo were all isolated and didn't get much to do. Adnan was probably the one looking the best out of the three, if I had to pick one. But it is difficult to rate players when we fail to involve them. I had the same difficulty last season with RvP up front. Always on the move, looking decent but not receiving anything.   Wayne Rooney - 6.5   Oh, I almost forgot. I probably tune down is rating by 0,5 or 1, as I expected more from the captain. Involving himself or at least getting on the end of a few out of the many flicks Depay provided should have been a minimum.  That said, I am not sure about ratings in the first pre season game. Especially Herrera and Rooney will do much better once they get a few games under their belt. They looked rusty and tired."
reddevils,3dsb5w,rdzzl,3,Sun Jul 19 10:10:59 2015 UTC,"Mata was also the one that assisted the only goal in the game. Mata may have been mostly quiet, but he was involved in many of the plays. So he deserves much higher rating.  I disagree with almost every rating for the second half team. You gave all the young players low scores (except Pereira) and gave Schweinsteiger the highest score. While I didn't think Bastian made any mistakes or played poorly, I wouldn't say he was the best player of the second half.  I think all the youth players deserve a collective high score for the level of energy they injected into the game. The vets in the first half played cautiously and experimented with new instructions, while the youth came out blasting. It's too bad they didn't get any goals for their troubles, b/c if they had I'd guarantee those ratings would be through the roof. But despite it, they were great moving the ball and being a lot to handle.   I would like to see the youth players mixed in with the vets next game. It may settle them down enough to increase the goal tally.  P.s. I'm not a fan of Evans, but he definitely deserved more than 6. He made many key stops and his passing was good. Plus no major mistakes like last season."
reddevils,3dsb5w,reddit_no_likey,2,Sun Jul 19 11:08:00 2015 UTC,"Paddy should be closer to a 7. Doubting the TV cameras followed him closely but he made a lot of intelligent runs down the right side into open space, but for the most part did not receive a pass. Also while he wasn't tested very much, when he was he did not get caught out of position"
reddevils,3dsb5w,boshjalka,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:58:17 2015 UTC,Carrick was probably one of the worst players on the pitch first half. If they weren't offside twice it would have been 2-1 at the end of the first half due to Carrick losing possession. That sloppy pass to Johnstone was horrible. But hey its pre season. Time to get ready for the real season.

Why would we make such a big and definitive leak all of a sudden when none of our targets have been leaked this season? None of the journalists had any proper information before we signed anyone and now all of a sudden we give them such a concrete leak about a transfer target?  It doesn't make sense at all other than it being used a ruse to throw people off our real targets and intentions still.   Plus, Pedro would only add to our surplus of wingers should di Maria stay anyway. It would also reduce januzaj and pereira's playing time in good likelihood. Mata already plays a role similar enough in some aspects.  I really think the leak was just kind of throwing a bone to placate the journalists and also to throw off the other clubs and such.

You even see some posters say mental things like we shouldn't be Lacazette in because it will hinder Wilson or shouldn't sign Bale because we need to give Januzaj minutes it's insane.  However, If Di Maria plays like he did in the last 4 months of his Real career we don't need to strengthen no.  But if he plays like did for us last season then I don't think that's a title winning set of wingers, especially if Memphis also has a fairly middling season given he's young and from a much weaker league.  It's not exactly impossible that ADM plays like he did last season and Memphis takes a while to settle is it? Then we're left with the Mata/Young combo which led us to 4th.  I don't think much of Mata out wide anyway, I don't think it be a bad thing to bring in another player."

Di Maria was short of starts last year, Januzaj and Pereira barely got a game at all, we already had close to enough wingers and then we bought Memphis.  Just think Pedro would be unnecessary and isn't an improvement on our best XI.  If a super quality player like Bale becomes available then buy him but we don't need competition or depth there currently."

For the first 2/3 of the season we didn't play 433 with them as the wingers.   Remember we had a huge dip again at the end after the great bit of form with the City/Pool/Spurs wins. It wasn't all plain sailing after Christmas, we finished the season pretty poorly.  And the aim of this season isn't to finish 3rd or 2nd, it's to win it."

It wasn't all plain sailing after Christmas, we finished the season pretty poorly.   This was because of Carricks' injury against City tho. Our midfield last season without Carrick was really unbalanced."
reddevils,3dqqb8,heftigfin,-2,Sat Jul 18 20:47:56 2015 UTC,I think we can win a title with Di Maria/Mata/Memphis as starting wingers.  I wouldn't call Pedro a title winner
reddevils,3dqqb8,januzaj_44,4,Sat Jul 18 20:39:29 2015 UTC,Saying that mata/young combo led us to 4th is fallicious as there is a lot more to team and much greater issues that caused us to place 4th.
reddevils,3dqqb8,Fidelicious,2,Sat Jul 18 22:19:34 2015 UTC,"Isn't the biggest issue that we barely scored any goals?  You might think our defence looked weak on paper but they actually did alright goals conceded wise.  It's our inability to score enough which led us to 4th and the fact the Mata, ADM, Young combo wasn't good enough had a huge part in that (along with our strikers obviously)."
reddevils,3dqqb8,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:06:21 2015 UTC,"Late reply on this one! Obviously it's down to opinion and neither of us are coaches, but our lack of incisive passes from the centre of the park was huge in our inability to score goals. This was evident with the lack of a backup to Carrick.   AdM's season was ultimately underwhelming but Matas goal ratio and impact was great in a side lacking creative vision and though Young is no world beater he caused a lot of problems and created a lot.  The problem with defence is it has a horrendous knock on effect where our midfield has to cover for our centre halves and mata + young are committing themselves to defence due to overlaps. I think as a whole the squad needed strengthening and I do agree Utd should have world class exciting wingers. However I dont think they are to blame for our goal tally."
reddevils,3dqqb8,Fidelicious,-2,Tue Jul 21 13:33:48 2015 UTC,"The areas that caused us to finish 4th were Valencia as the only RB, lack of midfield depth and Fellaini starting as he and Herrera were the only CMs and lack of an experienced CB."
reddevils,3dqqb8,januzaj_44,-1,Sun Jul 19 08:16:15 2015 UTC,"Bollocks.  On paper those might look like the weaknesses, but that's not how it played out on the football field.  Our defensive was basically as good as anyone else, you can win the league conceding 37 goals across a season.  All our problems were in scoring goals, where 62 goals is nowhere near good enough and was well short of Chelsea, City and Arsenal.  Our issues had little to do with our centre backs or full backs, it was all in our wingers and attacking midfielders not creating enough and our strikers not scoring enough."
reddevils,3dqqb8,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:25:17 2015 UTC,"I think it's a tough balance. On one hand, I want to sign the best players possible and win all we can. On the other, I want United to be United. Like if Madrid's entire starting lineup wanted to leave tomorrow, it would be in our best interest to sign almost every one of them. Would we win the league next year? Probably. But it would feel...odd.   None of this is to say I think we should play undeveloped players just for the sake of playing them. It's just that, say, Januzaj or Wilson playing for United will always feel different to me than, say, Schweinsteiger ever will. Because if Januzaj becomes a star and wins us the league, I will feel like Manchester United did it. If Schweinsteiger wins us the league, I'll feel like I need to thank Bayern."
reddevils,3dqqb8,shredderrrrrr,2,Sun Jul 19 08:50:57 2015 UTC,None of this is to say I think we should play undeveloped players just for the sake of playing them   That's what Wilson and Perreira are though.  Neither of them would make the first XI of any PL sides besides maybe the newly promoted ones.  Januzaj is definitely ahead of them in his development and can start against the weaker sides and come on as a sub a lot.  There's no guarantee at all of any of them making and personally I think only Januzaj will and he won't go on to be a worldie but a very good player.  I think that given our precarious position right now in the top 4 it would be crazy to intentionally weaken the squad to give time to extremely raw players like Wilson and Perreira.
reddevils,3dqqb8,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:03:01 2015 UTC,"Oh no doubt. My apologies if it seemed as though I was calling for us to actively avoid buying good players so we could make room for players like Januzaj. 9 times out of 10, fielding the best possible team we can each game is the most important objective. The Premier League, much less Manchester United, isn't the place for coddling talent.   I was just explaining the basis for which it seems so many fans want us to stick with youth players instead of pushing them out. It makes sense to me. We want to give our boys a good shot. But realistically, you're right. We're not going to make Mata sit on the bench so we can develop Perreira. That'd be absurd. What would we do then if Perreira ended up coming good? Then we'd have to bench him to develop Perreira 2.0!   With that said, I should distinguish one last thing: Thinking we should not weakening our side to accommodate for young players is not the same as saying we shouldn't make an active effort to develop those players when possible. It's how they become good. In other words, we shouldn't sell Mata to give Perreira space. But we shouldn't prevent Perreira from seeing the field if an opportunity presents itself just because Mata is better."
reddevils,3dqqb8,shredderrrrrr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:16:03 2015 UTC,Depends on you think if we will win next year or if we're making an investment for better odds in years 2 & 3. There is totally a risk to relying in januzaj but there is also a big upside
reddevils,3dqqb8,Sabu113,7,Sat Jul 18 21:33:24 2015 UTC,In my opinion Pedro would be competition with Mata on the right and backup for the strikers. His experience for the Champions League would be useful too.
reddevils,3dqqb8,AJMcCoy612,6,Sat Jul 18 15:33:45 2015 UTC,"Well there's Mata, ADM, Januzaj, Depay and Perreira fighting for two wide attacking spots, assuming we play a 4-3-3 as the midfield buys would suggest.  Would Pedro be useful as an out and out striker?"

I figure they both need at least one successful season on loan before they are ready to be counted on. Both of them need consistent games in consistent roles for this stage of their career.
reddevils,3dqqb8,johnsom3,5,Sat Jul 18 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"Pedro is a very multifunctional players, with him we'll have a good striker and a great RW and LW"

reddevils,3dqqb8,i_dnt_always_comment,13,Sat Jul 18 15:56:14 2015 UTC,"Eh, Di Maria's problem was never that he was being restrained; he was given a pretty free role last season. His problem is that he's loose in possession and has an incredibly inconsistent end product. A strong midfield won't really do anything to mend that. If anything, it will make him feel like he can be even looser in possession."
reddevils,3dqqb8,wr712,2,Sat Jul 18 16:50:49 2015 UTC,"A strong midfield wont mend his game, but it does allow him the freedom to make those mistakes without it being as much of a problem.

reddevils,3dqqb8,cloudbreaker81,-2,Sun Jul 19 12:02:36 2015 UTC,"But the midfield will be supplying him when he's in better positions. The new midfield is so impressive due to the intelligence imo.

It wasn't to do with his teammates it was his fault.  His teammates constantly gave him the ball all the time in great position and he just constantly wasted possession and did very little with it. Ashley Young came in and did a much better job with the same midfield. He has no one to blame but himself."

The signings of Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger should allow for the flair players to be able to express themselves more.  Plus, if we sign Pedro as well then that is the wing depth that is absolutely vital considering the amount of games we could very well be playing this season. Memphis, Di Maria, Pedro and Mata as wingers with Young and Januzaj also involved is not only depth, but quality as well.   Essentially if he stays and we sign Pedro, we'd have a pretty complete midfield and wide attack, with both full back options sorted. That's all we'd need is a world class striker and a world class CB and i'd say we would 100% have our best squad since 07-09."
reddevils,3dqqb8,goodguy1994,4,Sat Jul 18 16:11:15 2015 UTC,"Memphis, Di Maria, Pedro and Mata as wingers with Young and Januzaj also involved   That's overkill, IMVHO. We need just 4 of them. I'd take Di Maria and Mata as world class players, and Memphis and Januzaj as their youth replacements. Pedro can come in as a striker. Young, while has was amazing for most of last season, is also 30 and a bit one-dimensional, so I'd rather he left than Di Maria."

And last season, for the beginning at least, he wasn't playing. But then when he did, he along with the rest of our team ripped Tottenham, Liverpool and Mam City a new one.

reddevils,3dqglw,MonsieurRyan,6,Sat Jul 18 14:30:39 2015 UTC,That they weren't brought on to the tour because they were headed for loans somewhere from the get-go. I thought it'd be a better team though
reddevils,3dqglw,rdzzl,6,Sat Jul 18 14:53:42 2015 UTC,I thought it'd be a better team though   Barnsley are preferred because they have decent facilities even though they are a league 1 team & they are located close to Manchester. Also their Chairman served as one of the board of directors at United for many many years and is still close to United.
reddevils,3dqglw,freckleddemon,2,Sat Jul 18 16:55:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah it isnt a bad choice of club per se, im just not sure if the level of the league is as high we would want"
reddevils,3dqglw,rdzzl,2,Sat Jul 18 17:43:04 2015 UTC,Rothwell was loaned to a Championship club last season and he was mostly a sub. No point in loaning them to higher leagues if they don't get regular game time.   If they do well they can always be loaned to other clubs in January.
reddevils,3dqglw,freckleddemon,6,Sat Jul 18 17:54:09 2015 UTC,"Rothwell was loaned to a Championship club last season and he was mostly a sub.   That's a fair point, though I got to say that loaning a youth player to a club that has shit to its knees was a weird move. Maybe I rate them higher than I should, but I genuinely think they would have been a good addition to a lot of teams in the Championship:  Brentford, Brighton, Charlton, Huddersfield, Ipswich, MK Dons, Rotherham, Sheffield Wednesday and Wolves just from looking at the league table.  Hopefully it helps them that they go together to the same club. I'd love to see them be regulars and earn an even better loan move after January."

reddevils,3dqglw,MonsieurRyan,7,Sat Jul 18 14:55:06 2015 UTC,I had high hopes for those guys but with recent transfers there's just no way for them to break into the squad.
reddevils,3dqglw,edmontom,3,Sat Jul 18 13:34:10 2015 UTC,"Update: Both played today but i cant comment on how they actually played because i wasn't there BUT Rothwell scored on his debut and from what i've heard he was direct, quick thinking and had some good skill and touches. Cant think Rothwell will be a proper first teamer in the league as our first chouce attacking mid is out for 3-4 weeks so after that i expect him to be an impact player and see what happens after that. Either way i'm happy to have got Ben back. Hoping we'd get him permanently, rather the fee was too much at this time or we get to buy him in January. 2 wingers a striker and a left back and we could be set for the season.

reddevils,3drdrh,IBENGM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:36:48 2015 UTC,"No. I highly disagree. He's why :   Dragovic had been the leader of the defense of FC Basel. He was their best with Schär coming after that. Against big teams, they looked to him to control that backline. Whereas Jones is overlooked for that role. He's constantly injured. He's a better header of the ball than Jones & he stays fit.  Dragovic is constantly playing for his national team. Unlike Jones, who has to dropout due to injury. Austria has a young squad led by Alaba. Dragovic is one of their best players so they expect him to perform.  Did I mention injuries? Jones is constantly injured. Dragovic isn't a downgrade from Jones. He is Jones plus so much more. Just watch him."
reddevils,3drdrh,KlausJanVanWolfhaus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:46:12 2015 UTC,"Sorry are you from Austria or something bcoz you sound like you are defending a fellow countryman lol,the only point to acknowledge from what you said is that Dragovic stays fit most of the time compared to jones.(which is true)  So here is the thing,if that's the difference we could get plenty of other CB's who always stay fit example Godin,Ramos or De Vrij who may be available and are miles better than Dragovic, coz only these and a few others are the ones i could say are upgrades to Jones.   Jones is a very Talented CB its just the injuries that pull him back but when fit dragovic is nowhere near his level imo,and i have watched dragovic in Champions league and checked the stats!"

reddevils,3drdrh,pearlz176,12,Sat Jul 18 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're being downvoted, De Vrij had an excellent season."
reddevils,3drdrh,dmoneyx3,30,Sat Jul 18 19:09:54 2015 UTC,"Probably because we're looking for an experienced CB, who can be the leader of our defense. Someone like Hummels, Otamendi or Ramos.  Personaly, I'd say we need a reliable CB who's very consistent and composed on the ball. Though he's not that experienced, De Vrij fits the bill for me."
reddevils,3drdrh,pearlz176,16,Sat Jul 18 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"A genuine question: What really does make Otamendi an experienced defender? He had one good season in Valencia. I haven't really looked at how he played in Porto, but his appearance in top-level football compared to the likes of Ramos and Hummels doesn't really seem comparable. Or maybe I'm wrong?"
reddevils,3drdrh,heftigfin,4,Sun Jul 19 01:51:50 2015 UTC,"Most Porto fans said they're surprised he's getting praise and Mangala was the better CB of the two but Otamendi had to lead/organise him.  Otamendi didn't look much of a step up from Rojo at Copa America tbh, Garay looked much better."
reddevils,3drdrh,inu50kza,0,Sun Jul 19 03:01:55 2015 UTC,"I would love Otamendi at United. I think he'd be a brilliant player for us, but if there is a chance we could sign Ramos, I'd rather we pursue it. Being United, we have to capability to wait these things out."
reddevils,3drdrh,heftigfin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:39:15 2015 UTC,"Disagree. Besides, it's Jones, not Rojo he needs to be a step up from. Rojo is our #3. That much is crystal clear."
reddevils,3drdrh,loch_,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:07:13 2015 UTC,I'm not sure how you can be certain that Jones is number 2. LVG expressly stated he likes to have a left footed CB.  Rojo was clearly out 2nd vest CB last season.

reddevils,3drdrh,giblets24,2,Sun Jul 19 00:04:36 2015 UTC,"City have been surprisingly poor defensively. I have no idea what happened to Kompany but he's been poor, as has Mangala. Their best defender imo last season was Demichellis, but even then he's not in the same bracket as Cahill/Terry."
reddevils,3drdrh,OldManTrafford,2,Sat Jul 18 20:58:48 2015 UTC,City don't have the same protection in midfield any more.
reddevils,3drdrh,WillyMorganOnTheWing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:45:01 2015 UTC,"Their top end talent is in that echelon, more so than Chelsea even. 6x world class is rare. They don't defend as a collective, and they need to supplement their transcendent talent with better role players, something they've completely flunked at the last few years.   It's a new season. Judged on potential, they're there. Don't forget they ended last season on a high as well."
reddevils,3drdrh,loch_,9,Sun Jul 19 09:03:17 2015 UTC,Still think Smalling & Jones could become our CB partnership for the next 10 years. 25 and 23 and tons of potential and learning to do.
reddevils,3drdrh,digitag,2,Sat Jul 18 22:40:22 2015 UTC,"A bit of topic but I always heard people say this and I found it quite cringe/annoying, but could you please tell me why you say plural of the teams? ""City's"" ""Real madrid's"" wtf? Just say city and Real Madrid? Or am I missing out on something?"
reddevils,3drdrh,hitpop,3,Sun Jul 19 07:31:38 2015 UTC,"I dont think we would have too much problem if Rojo & Smalling pick up where they left off last season, however an injury to either would leave me a little worried if we have to rely on Jones/Mcnair..."
reddevils,3drdrh,clg93,2,Sat Jul 18 19:29:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I actually really like Rojo and Smalling, with jones as depth. Another left footer would be great or at least another with starting quality....jones has showed the potential but not the consistency. And for me, inconsistent = poor. No two ways about it."
reddevils,3drdrh,kelevr4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:06:28 2015 UTC,"Long time lurker, first time comment. You are wrong. Straight up wrong. Jones and Smalling are excellent center basis, Phill Jones in particular. Why you think they always get selected for England? Their problem has always been a lack of midfield protection, now that's been addressed you wait and see, we simply won't sign another center back. The whole Ramos thing was pure opportunity, we actually don't need one and you don't actually understand Premier League football o If you think we're do."
reddevils,3drdrh,Nthldn,7,Sun Jul 19 00:32:55 2015 UTC,"Why you think they always get selected for England?   Yeah about that, you don't exactly need to be Franco Baresi to get a game for England."
reddevils,3drdrh,JuanRiquelme,2,Sun Jul 19 09:16:58 2015 UTC,Why is he selected for England? Name me better ENGLISH CBs. Hardly any now. Name me better CBs of other nationalities? The list is endless.   That's a very short sighted and narrow minded argument to suggest him playing for England must mean he's amazing. The entire english squad isn't event that good to begin with.
reddevils,3drdrh,Feezbull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:53:52 2015 UTC,"I kinda think you might be right. A decent centre back would inject some confidence but with adequate protection in front of the back 4 we don't concede many goals, and now it's better than ever."
reddevils,3drdrh,MorningFresh123,-5,Sun Jul 19 04:51:10 2015 UTC,"Personally, I disagree. Nothing to do with knowing the game or not.   Yea Jones and Smalling are not elite CBs, but we also have Rojo, McNair and Blackett as cover. Assuming Evans leaves, thats 5 CBs, three of which will be expecting to start a lot of games next year to continue their progression.   I don't think we NEED another CB, but I'd obviously welcome a world class signing there to compete in the champions league. But I see one of Smalling/Jones/Rojo will have to be sold to make room, something which very few people are mentioning."
reddevils,3drdrh,cnwo,13,Sat Jul 18 19:31:30 2015 UTC,Blackett is nowhere near good enough. Pereira did more defensive work than he did yesterday.
reddevils,3drdrh,omegaxLoL,18,Sat Jul 18 19:48:42 2015 UTC,"Blackett is absolutely not good enough. Not even as a backup. I doubt he ever will be.   Numbers are irrelevant. We can't win the Champions League with Smalling and Rojo/Jones. God forbid - if one of them gets injured (we've seen Rojo get unlucky with injuries as well as Jones and Smalling being ridiculously injury prone), we're fucked. Even if they did remain fit, that's not a CL winning CB partnership, and it needs to be. I'm not saying we should be expecting to win the CL, but we shouldn't go into next season resigned to not winning it - which we will be without signing a top CB."
reddevils,3drdrh,Hassi94,3,Sat Jul 18 19:38:21 2015 UTC,"I get you point of view but it's not that black and white. SAF saw the potential and there's no reason LVG can't see it either. They're both very young for CBs still. It's easy to say 'we can't win the CL with Smalling and Jones when Chelsea have Terry and Cahill' but they weren't world class CBs when they were 23. Those 2 have what it takes to become top tier defenders, IMO.  I agree we need depth but with Rojo, Darmian, McNair etc. We arguably do have that."
reddevils,3drdrh,digitag,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:46:09 2015 UTC,"They may be good enough for the future, but they aren't good enough right now.  Also, SAF wasn't always right about everything, especially when talking about young players. In his latter years he made lots of poor purchases. He said that Phil Jones would be the best player ever to play for United, but there's absolutely zero chance of that."
reddevils,3drdrh,Hassi94,-1,Sun Jul 19 06:37:10 2015 UTC,"Down voted for having a different opinion?!   @Hassi94 yea I agree with a lot of that. Blackett is 5th choice at best, he's a lot lot better than many other champions league teams' 5th choice CB.   To go far in the champions league we could do with a signing absolutely, but Evans and another will have to be sold out of the 3."
reddevils,3drdrh,cnwo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:58:33 2015 UTC,"Well we just signed them onto long term deals, so there's no rush to ship them out. We can persist with 'too many' CBs if we want, and until players like Jones show they should or shouldn't be kept."
reddevils,3drdrh,Hassi94,-7,Sat Jul 18 20:03:09 2015 UTC,"Dude, I don't know what games you've been watching but Blackett, Evans, Jones and McNair are GARBAGE.   We need a new CB."
reddevils,3drdrh,ohyou123,7,Sat Jul 18 20:08:02 2015 UTC,"Blackett is nowhere near good enough. McNair although a very exciting young player he is still fairly inconsistent. That leaves Smalling, Jones and Rojo. All three are quite injury prone. No way we can challenge for top 2 with what we have. We need a player like Otamendi, preferably Ramos."
reddevils,3drdrh,CosmicGravy,2,Sat Jul 18 19:44:33 2015 UTC,Have you ever watched Otamendi play?
reddevils,3drdrh,WillyMorganOnTheWing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:46:03 2015 UTC,Yup went back and watched a good few of Valencias matches. I did cheat and mainly watched the matches where he got man of the match to see what he is like at his best but it still counts. Why do you ask?
reddevils,3drdrh,CosmicGravy,3,Sun Jul 19 10:24:55 2015 UTC,"Did you see Barcelona vs Valenica at Camp Nou? Otamendi was monstrous that game, stopped Messi in his tracks several times."
reddevils,3drdrh,fpvmtimbdbo,2,Sun Jul 19 12:11:32 2015 UTC,Yeah I watched him in 2 of the Barca vs Valencia games. Yeah as a single defender he was pretty beastly and you could see how amazing he was but they still lost so it's kind of hard to get over excited. Watching him in the matches vs Villareal and Atleti though he was fucking spot on. He was a pillar at the back.
reddevils,3drdrh,CosmicGravy,3,Sun Jul 19 13:01:18 2015 UTC,I didn't watch the Villareal game but I did see the 1-1 draw with Atletico. That was one proper football match! The tussle between Otamendi and Raul Garcia was one of the most titanic individual battles I've ever seen.
reddevils,3drdrh,fpvmtimbdbo,3,Sun Jul 19 13:09:45 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah Otamendi looked like he was gonna kill him, he looked like he was gonna kill everyone that day, I definitely thought him, Raul Garcia and Godin were all start scrapping! I definitely think Otamendi would be a huge improvement for us. He's so physical and he is a lot more pacey than you would think. My only problem is that I have heard people say last season was his breakout season and before that he was fairly mediocre. That's not that good for a guy who is 27 years old. Saying that though watching him play you can see he is such a good player!"
reddevils,3drdrh,CosmicGravy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:17:08 2015 UTC,I ask as far too many here obsess over various players despite never actually watching them. Far too many flavours of the month.
reddevils,3drdrh,WillyMorganOnTheWing,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:07:32 2015 UTC,Yeah that's drfinitely true. I usually would ask myself but it's hard to trust people's opinions on players so now I just go and find the matches a player I'm interested has played best in and watch it through and see how they are. It's fairly biased as I don't know how they are on average but it gives a good idea as to what you can expect from them when they are on form.
reddevils,3drdrh,CosmicGravy,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"I like how you made a nice well thought answer but got downvoted just because....  I agree with you but I would like to see Jones and Smalling form a partnership, how will they ever improve if we don't let them play and attack them every time they make a mistake."
reddevils,3drdrh,MullerReus,-1,Sat Jul 18 23:34:21 2015 UTC,"Rojo I don't mind. I want to see more of him though. Jones, I have zero faith in - the same with Evans. Gary Neville has said that Jones isn't even a centre half. Smalling still hasn't shown me that he can bully the likes of the Messi's, Ronaldo's, Lewandowski's, Suarez's, Neymar's, Bale's, Benzema's, Aguero's or Muller's of this world....I just don't see it.  I genuinely think we need a monster centre half - something akin to a half Cannavaro - half Beckenbauer cyborg."
reddevils,3drdrh,ohyou123,4,Sat Jul 18 19:38:09 2015 UTC,"Neither rio or vidic could bully 3/4 of that list in their prime, quite the opposite on a number of occasions (don't mention Torres) But what they could do was create a partnership, understanding and organisation which spread across the back, which collectively could keep them out.   Smalling came leaps and bounds for me last season and looked solid. Starting to show authority and temperament needed."
reddevils,3drdrh,MK-Ultra-,4,Sat Jul 18 22:46:26 2015 UTC,Who thinks we don't need one?? I've no idea who if Otamendi wasn't a legit link and Ramos won't happen
reddevils,3drdrh,GarethGore,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:34:04 2015 UTC,A CB could make us serious title contenders at this point. If we cut down on the goals against and score just as many as last year we are right in the hunt.

reddevils,3drdrh,dhillonaire,-1,Sun Jul 19 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"IMO, we really do need another CB, but I feel like LVG may disagree, especially considering Jones and Smalling recently signing new contracts.  Edit: haha, motherfuckers. Now he's saying Blind could be the fix, told ya'll."
reddevils,3drdrh,mexicanpetal,0,Sat Jul 18 19:35:35 2015 UTC,"He will definitely buy one. If he doesn't it would probably be his biggest failing since he became the manager.  If Jones or Smalling hadn't have signed a new deal, he'd be bringing in two centre backs instead of one I'd think."
reddevils,3drdrh,blorimer542,29,Sat Jul 18 19:51:06 2015 UTC,probably just a negotiation tactic. Believe nothing you read. Even this comment.
reddevils,3drdrh,claytonbarkley,26,Sat Jul 18 20:40:12 2015 UTC,Of course James Robson himself isn't using United's name to drum up interest.
reddevils,3drdrh,JeSuisLouis,10,Sat Jul 18 18:52:57 2015 UTC,"Of course it's not true, we badly need a central back, but we can't expect to just throw £35m like it's nothing, we should try to lower the fee."
reddevils,3drdrh,peduxe,5,Sat Jul 18 19:09:42 2015 UTC,"In terms of potential, we have got very good young centerbacks in Jones and Mcnair. Smalling to me looks reliable now. We just need one more experienced leader at the back who can command the backline and improve our youngsters everyday. Not to mention, the future pairing of Axel Tuanzebe and Fosu-Mensah!"
reddevils,3drdrh,madhavneupane,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:26:40 2015 UTC,Smalling has improved immeasurably! He'll be United's captain before long
reddevils,3drdrh,diabloroja,-6,Sun Jul 19 22:55:31 2015 UTC,Even Gary Neville has said that Jones simply isn't a centre back. Paddy McNair is nowhere near ready.  We need a monster centre half that is going to command the back line. We don't have that in the squad and we haven't had it since Vidic and Ferdinand pairing ended.
reddevils,3drdrh,ohyou123,15,Sat Jul 18 19:30:18 2015 UTC,"When did Neville say that? Be surprising as he is an England NT coach, a team which has started Jones at CB in a lot of games. I think Jones will be a good CB, perhaps not as good as we hope, but he is still young.   Much too early to predict McNair, who I agree is nowhere near ready and way over rated."
reddevils,3drdrh,OhHayJohn,10,Sat Jul 18 19:32:32 2015 UTC,Paul Scholes was the one who said Jones isn't smart enough to be a CB
reddevils,3drdrh,therosepetal,8,Sat Jul 18 19:42:43 2015 UTC,"Think that was Scholes, not Neville."
reddevils,3drdrh,Hassi94,2,Sat Jul 18 19:43:09 2015 UTC,I didn't say Jones and Mcnair were ready. They are young and have potential.
reddevils,3drdrh,madhavneupane,4,Sat Jul 18 19:43:29 2015 UTC,"A few people have asked, why aren't we in for him, and how come we have been linked with him for months? I think it could be that we do/did have serious interest, but negotiations have hit a snag and this is probably a way for Ed to back away and let us fans know that as of right now the transfer isn't going to happen. This doesn't mean it's dead just that as of right now we can't agree to terms with Valencia."
reddevils,3drdrh,mattmanutd,4,Sat Jul 18 20:24:09 2015 UTC,I don't really believe this for a second
reddevils,3drdrh,XxTRIPLSHTxX,3,Sat Jul 18 19:02:01 2015 UTC,So am I really supposed to believe that the last 7-8 months of getting constantly linked with Otamendi were just bullshit? Right on.

reddevils,3drdrh,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:20:07 2015 UTC,"We might have scouted him at one point but the club scout plenty of players but I'm pretty sure it never reached a 'serious' stage, certainly not the level that his agent and the media were talking about where it's been agreed for him to join almost every transfer window in the last 3 years"
reddevils,3drdrh,wakey87433,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:24:51 2015 UTC,"This one-size-fits-all approach doesn't really work when it comes to transfers. I do believe we were once interested in Gaitan over 3 years back, then the interest died, and it's back again. Not a gotta-have-him-at-all-costs interest, but a he-could-be-a-target-if-AdM-leaves one. Rafael's agent confirmed as much recently that we were trying to include Rafa in a deal with Benfica for Gaitan.   As far as Garay is concerned, again, I think we wanted to sign him but he chose Zenit. Since then, all the links have came across as his agent drumming up interest in a move away from Russia. The recent Valencia rumors seem much more solid in comparison and make sense.  Coming to Otamendi, we need a CB. Even my dog knows it by now and he can't even say GGMU. He was one of the best in La Liga and his agent has always been vocal about the fact that Nic wants to leave Valencia after last season and even the club wants to cash in on the deal. Not to forget, great CBs are a little hard to come by these days. This recent ""not interested"" line seems like a ploy to get Valencia to lower the fee to around €40mn because, like the story has been so far in this window, we don't want to be fleeced by other clubs, and we know they're open to selling since they already have a replacement lined up.   EDIT: Didn't want to go into the Lopez-Lim-Mendes-Perez-Ramos-DDG angle because this already reads like an essay. But the point was that the more nuanced the news, the more is the likelihood of an interest in the player."

reddevils,3drdrh,savant9,8,Sat Jul 18 18:59:51 2015 UTC,"Injury prone, need one anyway since Evans looks to be on his way out."
reddevils,3drdrh,as520,-16,Sat Jul 18 19:00:38 2015 UTC,"Evans is on his way out because he's the worst of bunch in a position that's already at full capacity. When you factor in Daley blind, Luke shaw, darmain and Valencia - logistical we don't need one. How many people do you think you can put on a team sheet?"
reddevils,3drdrh,savant9,6,Sat Jul 18 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about? Those 4 are not centre backs, they are full backs. We only have Rojo, Smalling, Jones and McNair for those two positions, and they are all injury prone and quite inexperienced."
reddevils,3drdrh,blorimer542,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:09:43 2015 UTC,"And based on LVG's philosophy only Rojo would play at LCB because he likes them to be left footed or very good with their left foot, like Evans. So one would think we'd be after a left footed CB."
reddevils,3drdrh,soundthealarm21,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:19:18 2015 UTC,Otamendi is quite 2 footed from what I've seen. Played at LCB a lot and can play balls with his left.

Blind and Valencia alone will be two names LVG will either want on the bench/in the starting 11. Both extremely versatile which is what he prefers. You're not factoring in other players, I just honestly believe there's no room.   Maybe this year they won't be so injury prone, who knows? How will we know if they aren't given the chance? Smalling was very impressive after his fuck up at City, he'll be out to prove himself.   ""They aren't experienced"". Well, let's give them a bit of experience. You can't just buy an experienced player and assume everything will come good."

There's absolutely no way you've watched Jones and Smalling for the last couple of years and not being absolutely furious at the mistakes they make regularly. Mistakes that have nothing to do with poor midfielders. Our CBs are shit. People have warmed up to Smalling because of his second half of the season last season but I'm still not convinced. We NEED a world class CB if we expect to win the league
reddevils,3drdrh,BHButcher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:59:47 2015 UTC,"Five centre backs is a satisfactory amount when 3 of them are injury prone, and one is a youth player like McNair. United will play a tonne of games next season, there will be many chances to play for each of them."
reddevils,3drdrh,blorimer542,-5,Sat Jul 18 19:36:27 2015 UTC,Footballers aren't injury prone their entire careers you know.
reddevils,3drdrh,savant9,5,Sat Jul 18 19:40:28 2015 UTC,"So, let me get this straight.   You don't want United to sign a centre back, because you HOPE that Jones, Smalling, and Rojo will all have an injury free season, despite the fact that none of them have been able to do this in any of the seasons that they have played for united so far?  Gotcha, sound reasoning. Can't wait for the McNair-Blackett partnership next season at Stoke!"
reddevils,3drdrh,blorimer542,2,Sat Jul 18 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not factoring full backs into the discussion because they are entirely irrelevant when discussing centre backs.  Do you honestly believe that United can compete with Chelsea next season with Smalling, Jones, Rojo and McNair being United's only centre backs? If so, I think that's ludicrous if I'm being honest.  You can't say ""well maybe this season they won't be injury prone"". We've been saying that for a few years when it comes to Smalling, Jones, and also Evans.  Smalling was very good last season, but he wasn't sensational. Jones and Rojo were unreliable. McNair is far too inexperienced and raw to be a 4th choice centre back in a team with 3 injury prone centre backs.  You can't just say ""give them experience!"" Any successful team needs a combination of experience and inexperience in their team, and United don't have enough experience in the centre of defence."
reddevils,3drdrh,blorimer542,-5,Sat Jul 18 19:32:30 2015 UTC,"You don't understand. There's only so much names that can be put on a team sheet. And in the squad we have now there are very good performers who'll merit being on the team sheet. Darmain, shaw, Valencia, rojo, Jones, smalling, McNair. There's 7 players already with a possible 5 being dropped every week assuming your marquee CB signing is playing well week in week out.   Then you have to factor in the midfield. How many players are there? I'll let you go look for yourself and try and drop a handful of them every week.  Then factor in young players who'll be trying to impress (peirara, Adnan)   3 forwards in Rooney chica and Wilson.  And please stop assuming they'll all be injured Jesus Christ!!"
reddevils,3drdrh,savant9,3,Sat Jul 18 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"Mate, you're not making any sense. Are you trying to tell me that players will have to be dropped? Because that's an obvious statement. Players ""merit"" their place in the team by being the best player in their position. Nothing else matters.  I'm talking about the centre of defence. I don't give a shit about the other positions, or the bench. You have to compartmentalise the team here. Smalling/Rojo/Jones/McNair is inadequate. United need a quality CB signing. All of them would still get game time, because injuries are inevitable (especially with these players considering their past record, which would be utterly ludicrous to ignore), and there is going to be a shit tonne of games.   United played Smalling/Evans/Rojo/Jones/McNair/Blackett/Blind/Carrick at centre back last season at some point. The defence was a disaster last season. You really telling me that McNair/Smalling/Rojo/Jones is enough to challenge for the title?"
reddevils,3drdrh,blorimer542,-5,Sat Jul 18 20:14:26 2015 UTC,Right fuck this. If united sign a left footed centre back I'll donate 25 quid to your favourite charity - deal?  Mark this post for transfer deadline day lol.
reddevils,3dsoi3,mikeman1997,79,Sun Jul 19 02:06:30 2015 UTC,"Fell out with Ferguson basically. Fergie essentially felt that Beck's private life was becoming too public & that all the glitz & glamour of the celebrity life was impacting on his football.   In Fergie's ideal world, Beckham would have married some quiet girl from Manchester & lived a life like Scholes (isolate himself from the media). Unfortunately for Fergie, Beckham was married to Posh & were probably the most popular celeb couple in the media at the time."
reddevils,3dsoi3,MadJambo,25,Sun Jul 19 02:13:04 2015 UTC,"Should emphasize here that it wasn't just that Fergie thought his football was affected as a result of his lifestyle, the fact is during this period Becks' form was poor. He did turn up with quite a few goals that season which sort of masks his performances in the history books, however his performances were generally quite poor. I remember thinking at the time that it was quite a tidy bit of business we had done when we received that sum of money for him."
reddevils,3dsoi3,7evenStrings,44,Sun Jul 19 04:30:31 2015 UTC,The worst memory of my childhood was Becks leaving to Real Madrid and not the absence of my dad.
reddevils,3dsoi3,breuh,8,Sun Jul 19 04:44:35 2015 UTC,It crushed me.
reddevils,3dsoi3,Hassi94,2,Sun Jul 19 07:39:09 2015 UTC,"He'd lost focus at the time and whatever was happening behind the scenes did affect his football. Solksjaer replaced him on the right side of midfield at a match vs Leeds I think, and basically kept him out of the side even though that wasn't his position.   I was still gutted when Becks left though as the media was playing it up as the start of the end of the class of 92 (IIRC Butt may have left around the same time?) it didn't happen yet but there was a real fear it would.   I was actually quite disappointed in his statement when he joined Real though. He left his agency and stated that he 'needed to focus on his football'. I remember thinking 'why couldn't you do that at United?' Still a legend though. And the emotional speech at a testimonial at OT a few years later fixed any bridge he may have burned with the club."
reddevils,3dsoi3,BoyWhoCanDoAnything,2,Sun Jul 19 09:07:57 2015 UTC,Solskjaer did a great job on the right when he was drafted in.
reddevils,3dsoi3,wharsmetoothpicson,2,Sun Jul 19 23:48:18 2015 UTC,Yeah he wasn't making the team his last year. Solskjaer was playing on the right wing most games.
reddevils,3dsoi3,G_Morgan,45,Sun Jul 19 11:13:18 2015 UTC,"In SAF's words ""Beckam chose fame over football"". It was kind of true  in the last season before he left United. SAF felt Beckham's intensity had dropped and wasn't working hard enough and he also heavily disapproved of Posh Spice.  United got knocked out of the FA Cup by Arsenal and SAF was giving Becks an earful about not tracking back after the game in the locker room. They were arguing and SAF kicked a boot out of anger and it hit Beckam. Becks had to be restrained by other players as he got up to have a go at Fergie.  SAF later said it was unintentional and he apologized for it. Next day Beckham was photographed in the media with a bandage highlighting the wound. Fergie felt Becks intentionally publicized the wound. So he went to the board and told them Becks had to go because he thought he was bigger than the manager. So off he went."

reddevils,3dsoi3,imsowitty21,2,Sun Jul 19 12:03:04 2015 UTC,Dramatic re-enactment - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibIHP3gABok
reddevils,3dsoi3,ph11jp,28,Sun Jul 19 12:54:02 2015 UTC,"Sir Alex Ferguson explained why in his second autobiography. This is the relevant excerpt:   ""The confrontation between us that caused so much excitement around the game was an FA Cup fifth-round tie against Arsenal at Old Trafford in February 2003, which we lost 2–0.  David’s offence in that particular game was that he neglected to track back for the second Arsenal goal, scored by Sylvain Wiltord. He merely jogged. The boy just kept on running away from him. At the end I got on to him. As usual, with David at that time, he was dismissive of my criticism. It’s possible that he was starting to think he no longer needed to track back and chase, which were the very qualities that had made him what he was. He was around 12 feet from me. Between us on the floor lay a row of boots. David swore. I moved towards him, and as I approached I kicked a boot. It hit him right above the eye. Of course he rose to have a go at me and the players stopped him. ‘Sit down,’ I said. ‘You’ve let your team down. You can argue as much as you like.’ I called him in the next day to go through the video and he still would not accept his mistake. As he sat listening to me, he didn’t say a word. Not a word.  ‘Do you understand what we’re talking about, why we got on to you?’ I asked.  He didn’t even answer me.  The next day the story was in the press. In public an Alice band highlighted the damage inflicted by the boot. It was in those days that I told the board David had to go. My message would have been familiar to board members who knew me. The minute a Manchester United player thought he was bigger than the manager, he had to go. I used to say, ‘The moment the manager loses his authority, you don’t have a club. The players will be running it, and then you’re in trouble.’  David thought he was bigger than Alex Ferguson. There is no doubt about that in my mind. It doesn’t matter whether it’s Alex Ferguson or Pete the Plumber. The name of the manager is irrelevant. The authority is what counts. You cannot have a player taking over the dressing room. Many tried. The focus of authority at Manchester United is the manager’s office. That was the death knell for him.""   From Sir Alex Ferguson: My Autobiography"
reddevils,3dsoi3,bloo2004,13,Sun Jul 19 07:15:46 2015 UTC,And SAF was exactly right to get rid of him at the time. Beckham has matured as a man now but I can see that side that SAF was referring to.
reddevils,3dsoi3,craptionbot,3,Sun Jul 19 09:40:13 2015 UTC,"This is probably the best explanation on why he left, and probably SAF did the right thing."
reddevils,3dsoi3,Gusrodlopez,8,Sun Jul 19 20:18:33 2015 UTC,Kinda sucks considering he literally lived red his entire life up to that point. Would have been nice had he stayed with giggs and scholes to retire here
reddevils,3dsoi3,JTRut,6,Sun Jul 19 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"I would say a deteriorating relationship with SAF was the main cause, but also SAF thought Real's bid of 35m was a really good price for a 28 year old player that was focused more on his brand then helping his team.   He also said at the time that Solskjaer was going to be the new RM, but that didn't pan out due to injuries. Everyone says Ronaldo was Becks replacement, but at the press conference for CR7, SAF said he was to be the eventual successor to Giggs at LW, which is funny because Giggs lasted longer than CR7."
reddevils,3dsoi3,Rept4r7,9,Sun Jul 19 08:36:59 2015 UTC,Didnt Fergie kick a boot at Becks eye? I might dont remember correctly

Some people found his critique disrespectful towards our hosts but I think he is trying to defend ManUtd's interest. LvG's bluntness here is on purpose and with a reason because he knows that something will change for the better when he gives of his critique this public. His position allows it also to do so because the board will soothe possible irritations with our American hosts. And so next time we're invited hosts will think twice before putting up a different show that might ruïn the pitch just before ManUtd has to play. They will want to avoid public embarrassment and so LvG get's what's best for ManUtd and that is a very good pitch which is important for the passing game we need practiced. He did the same last year when he criticized his own board on his first day in charge (!) about the pre season schedule and this years' pre-season is adjusted indeed.

In all honesty, they should have just played the game on the artificial turf the Sounders play on every week.  I'd love to invite LVG to Seattle for a Seahawks game so he can see what a real game at CenturyLink is like.  I haven't been to Old Trafford, but I have been to ""The CLink"" about 10 different times and it's one of the greatest stadiums to watch a game at in the country. I was actually at the game where the Seahawks fans broke the sound record during gameplay, 136.6 decibels!"

reddevils,3dpmgw,WildLlama,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:57:06 2015 UTC,"ITT: People complaining about the pitch used in a multi-use sporting complex that usually uses field turf.  To that I say, what did you expect? You can't lay down a world class pitch in a few days. If they wanted that kind of pitch, buy the stadium out for a few weeks prior so they can get it put down in time.  Yeah it was terrible but you can't expect differently when they don't have the time to do so and you can't expect them to not take the money off of the concessions, parking, and venue fees from a One Direction concert. That would just be bad business."

reddevils,3dp8jq,TY1901,10,Sat Jul 18 05:22:55 2015 UTC,He played a great half. One of the three best players in the first half alongside Young & Darmian.
reddevils,3dp8jq,JuhaWhiteEngetsu,5,Sat Jul 18 05:27:39 2015 UTC,I'd say Memphis was the best in the first half and Andreas Pereira was the best in the second half.
reddevils,3dp8jq,TY1901,7,Sat Jul 18 06:37:03 2015 UTC,Memphis didn't do enough for me. He should have been played on the wing with Mata in the hole.

reddevils,3dpmad,DatGuyRich,60,Sat Jul 18 05:44:26 2015 UTC,I'm happy for Chicha. He knows he wont be a starter but if he can be a good back up like he was in the 20th title season than we'll be sweet.
reddevils,3dpmad,TY1901,47,Sat Jul 18 05:49:49 2015 UTC,"If Young and Fellaini can be starters, then Hernandez can become one as well."
reddevils,3dpmad,xtfftc,10,Sat Jul 18 06:48:46 2015 UTC,No way Hernandez will start over Rooney. Unless Rooney is injured or out for some reason.

reddevils,3dpmad,brunsw1ck,16,Sat Jul 18 12:57:34 2015 UTC,I mean 2010-11 season i'm pretty sure Chicha scored 20 goals as a back up to Rooney and Berbatov so he's a great player to have.
reddevils,3dpmad,j0ydivisi0n,14,Sat Jul 18 10:00:33 2015 UTC,That was the season Chicharito and Berbatov won the title.
reddevils,3dpmad,Trickybuz93,6,Sat Jul 18 16:07:19 2015 UTC,That game where Chicarito scored something like 40 seconds in was sensational
reddevils,3dpmad,komarktoze,10,Sat Jul 18 16:41:06 2015 UTC,"He really was Chelsea's bane. I still remember his first goal, off the face and in. Don't think he will ever be able to score a better goal than that."

reddevils,3dpmad,komarktoze,15,Sat Jul 18 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"One of my favorite players I've seen since I started following United ten years ago. He seems like such a genuinely good person off the pitch and has some serious poaching abilities. Glad he's getting a chance at redemption.

reddevils,3dpmad,khaljose,4,Sat Jul 18 06:05:59 2015 UTC,I think he has goals in him. Ugly or not.  Think other (especially upper midtable) clubs are missing out.
reddevils,3dpmad,Sabu113,18,Sat Jul 18 07:45:28 2015 UTC,"Still really hope we sign another striker. Rooney, Hernandez, Wilson is not enough goals to win a PL title with the rest of our squad as it is."
reddevils,3dpmad,JuanRiquelme,28,Sat Jul 18 07:07:21 2015 UTC,Don't agree. We are relying on much more goals from midfield than from the strikers with our current system and with the lineup we have I feel confident we'll get them.
reddevils,3dpmad,Baron105,3,Sat Jul 18 09:53:58 2015 UTC,certainly for Plan A but I'd like us to have the players to have a plan B.
reddevils,3dpmad,devilsway,7,Sat Jul 18 13:38:17 2015 UTC,"I think the Plan B is to get enough goals from those 3 strikers and they're capable enough of that. Rooney, despite everyone's doubt about him is the one of the deadliest strikers in the league when it comes down to it and Hernandez is clinical in cameo performances. Hopefully this turns outs to be a breakout season for Wilson. Otherwise we can always buy someone during January if it doesn't go according to plan. The second half of the season is always ours anyway."
reddevils,3dpmad,Baron105,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:28:05 2015 UTC,We can use Fellaini or Memphis (and Wilson if he proves himself) as our plan B and C.
reddevils,3dpmad,TinFoiledHat,2,Sat Jul 18 19:22:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, Depay is a goalscorer and Mata will likely score more next season than he did last season. I expect Schweinsteiger to be scoring and Herrera might score more. Thing is, Van Persie still had 10 goals last season, which could be replaced by Hernandez. Wilson won't add much more than Falcao did. Losing Fellaini's goals and Young's is gonna counter most of it. And then the fact last season wasn't nearly enough for a league title, so I just completely disagree with you. The midfield this year won't get those needed goals."
reddevils,3dpmad,El_Giganto,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:07:43 2015 UTC,Let's agree to disagree.
reddevils,3dpmad,Baron105,8,Sun Jul 19 04:39:58 2015 UTC,"Our system is no longer based around striker scoring though, for all the shit Falcao got last season, he only got maybe 7 or 8 actual proper goal chances in the whole season.  There were matches where Rooney got like 12 touches. Our style now requires the striker to spend his time dragging the defence around, to make room for midfield."
reddevils,3dpmad,Ordinary650,8,Sat Jul 18 10:43:10 2015 UTC,You know... Not being based on feeding a striker does not mean you can't have one. A poacher like chicharito is ideal.  Not to mention dragging the defense around is something Hernandez does pretty well.
reddevils,3dpmad,monsterm1dget,3,Sat Jul 18 12:51:16 2015 UTC,7-8 chances? For a Manchester United quality player? Sorry... But just no... Sure shit went bad but not that bad.
reddevils,3dpmad,El_Giganto,-16,Sat Jul 18 18:12:05 2015 UTC,"Absolute, complete and total bollocks.  All systems involve striker trying to score goals. Our strikers didn't score because they were playing poorly.  Stop listening to the bollocks Gary Neville talks about us.  You do not sign Falcao, a pure poacher who's made a career out of scoring goals and doing very, very little else unless your system involves strikers scoring goals. Unless you think LVG is an idiot?"
reddevils,3dpmad,JuanRiquelme,9,Sat Jul 18 10:46:49 2015 UTC,"Unless you think LVG is an idiot?   Or I think he didn't make the decision to sign Falcao?   Are you telling me the way we played last season is the way you expect a team to play when they have Falcao? Like you said, a pure poacher who needs the ball quickly in and around the box, so why did we have him playing in a team based around possession based build up? How many times did we give him the quick ball he expects?  If he gets 7 or 8 chances in a full season with us, how is that down to him playing badly? Are you even thinking about what you are saying? The fact he missed most of them was down to him playing badly, but how can he or any striker be blamed for not being given chances by his teammates? Rooney, RVP, Wilson, Falcao, all had fuck all chances last season. Or is your theory that all 4 of them just happened to be shit at the same time?  LVG is a great manager, don't get so bent out of shape at me pointing out that Falcao was a stupid signing for us. When you have matches where the striker gets 12 touches, it's ""Absolute, complete and total bollocks"" to say that's because they were playing badly. Take your blinkers off."
reddevils,3dpmad,Ordinary650,-19,Sat Jul 18 11:26:20 2015 UTC,"Or I think he didn't make the decision to sign Falcao?   So who did exactly? Ed Woodward? A businessman? LVG has total say on our targets. We don't sign anyone he doesn't want. We're not a club with a DOF. We're a club with a manager who chooses the player and a businessman who makes the deals happen.   Are you telling me the way we played last season is the way you expect a team to play when they have Falcao? Like you said, a pure poacher who needs the ball quickly in and around the box, so why did we have him playing in a team based around possession based build up? How many times did we give him the quick ball he expects?   LVG's made a long career of having a poacher up front and a lot of possession behind him.  He signed Mario fucking Gomez for fuck's sake. You don't sign Mario Gomez and pick him every week if you don't want a striker to score goals.  Just like you don't sign Falcao if you don't want a striker to score goals.  You know who else he played at Bayern? Luca Toni - a poacher, Miroslav Klose - a poacher.  The man fucking loves strikers who score goals.   If he gets 7 or 8 chances in a full season with us, how is that down to him playing badly?   You seriously actually thinking Falcao only had 7 or 8 chances all season?  Falcao's looked just as shit for Colombia so it's not just the Man Utd system letting him down.  RVP is past it and injured a lot. Wilson is just a kid at this stage and Rooney's always been inconsistent.   LVG is a great manager, don't get so bent out of shape at me pointing out that Falcao was a stupid signing for us. When you have matches where the striker gets 12 touches, it's ""Absolute, complete and total bollocks"" to say that's because they were playing badly. Take your blinkers off.   Falcao was a bad signing because he's now a bad player, he's not a bad signing because we don't want our striker to score goals.  I can't believe some people are actually stupid enough to think LVG doesn't want his strikers to score.  He once picked Mario Gomez for 45 games in a season where he scored 39 goals. And you don't think he wants strikers who's job it is to score goals?  Unbelievable levels of stupidity."

reddevils,3dpmad,nerongod,2,Sat Jul 18 12:28:14 2015 UTC,"This kind of all makes sense now. I don't think LVG ever truly disliked Chica, but he was struggling for a spot in front of Rooney, Falcao and RvP.

reddevils,3dq9o2,OllieWillie,20,Sat Jul 18 11:57:18 2015 UTC,"It's exciting when he's on the ball, like something will definitely happen. Feels like how it was with Ronaldo. Long way to go to get to that level but, god it's a nice feeling :)"
reddevils,3dq9o2,njpatel,10,Sat Jul 18 12:51:38 2015 UTC,I get what you mean. When he's on the ball I just have that confidence that something positive will happen. Can't wait to see him bombing down the wings this season.
reddevils,3dq9o2,TheJoshider10,2,Sat Jul 18 13:09:46 2015 UTC,"Think we may see Shaw or young running the channels and Memphis linking up with the players around him and picking people out or getting a shot off. But yeah I'm excited to see what he can do, will definitely provide a spark in and around the penalty box."
reddevils,3dq9o2,cloudbreaker81,38,Sat Jul 18 14:46:42 2015 UTC,"He had some promising moments, but the thing I remember most is when he took the shot instead of passing to Young who was open in space. I like the determination and confidence but pre season or not i'd much prefer to see team play and the best option being chosen as opposed to self glory. That shit is the reason Januzaj has stalled his progression and I hope LVG tells him to always look for the better option.   Besides that, promising stuff. Not a fan of the formation we played but it gives us a chance to utilize more players. The real star of the show was Peirera who absolutely slayed it up in that second half. So slick on the ball."
reddevils,3dq9o2,TheJoshider10,18,Sat Jul 18 12:43:45 2015 UTC,"Memphis is known to be selfish on the ball. He cuts inside and goes for a shot rather than cross the majority of the time which could be why LVG wants to convert him to striker. He does have great vision too. His little chip over the top to Mata was quite good. I think Memphis has a much better end product than Januzaj so his selfishness isn't as wasteful as with Januzaj.  Yeah it seems LVG just wanted to try as many people as possible and that formation seemed to allow it. I completely agree with you on Pereira though, he was a definite stand out in the entire match. He's out to prove himself and if he keeps up playing that way I think we could see him make a few league appearances this year too!"
reddevils,3dq9o2,CosmicGravy,4,Sat Jul 18 13:00:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah the encouraging thing about him being selfish is he is more complete than Januzaj so there's more chance of a goal if he's taking the risk. Would still like to see more team play though.   I definitely think Peirera will make at least 5 league appearances. I hope he can be key in a League Cup run though. I'd be interested in seeing pretty much a mostly youth League Cup line up in the third round, similar to what we saw in the second half last night."
reddevils,3dq9o2,TheJoshider10,6,Sat Jul 18 13:07:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely he has a definite eye for goal but as shown by his stats last season he can assist too. LVG will definitely be able to mould him into a better player whether as a striker or winger I think he will link up well with the rest of the squad.  Yeah he definitely seems to have the skill and if DiMa leaves then that means he will only have to compete with Young and Memphis. I'm very excited to see how he gets in this season. I would love to see McNair, Pereira, Januzaj and Johnstone get a few cup games but I hope it doesn't go like last season as I really want to see us pick up some silverware this season, even if it is only the Capital one cup."
reddevils,3dq9o2,CosmicGravy,6,Sat Jul 18 13:11:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I think with all things considered he'll be a better fit for us than Di Maria as much as I wanted him to do well. If he goes and Pedro comes in then the prospect of both Depay and Pedro being goal scoring wingers excites me. Haven't had a proper one since Nani in 10/11.   I want the youngsters to take it seriously this year. It was ridiculous how we went out last year and I hope they don't bottle it this time round. I want them to see it as their time to shine and work their way up and the only way they can do that is by putting in a good show in the tournament. No faffing about acting like it's not important."
reddevils,3dq9o2,TheJoshider10,2,Sat Jul 18 13:15:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah our attacking and midfield options would be absolutely amazing! I can't fucking wait for the league to start. I think LVG underestimated the smaller teams as did some of the young players.  I can definitely see him fielding a few youngsters but there will be experienced players like Schweinsteiger, Otamendi,Rooney etc to keep the younger lads focused.  Yeah we definitely can't go another season without winning Silverware."
reddevils,3dq9o2,CosmicGravy,2,Sat Jul 18 13:33:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but you'll be sure that LVG told him exactly what he thinks about his choice to shoot instead of pass. That is like football 101, that is a pass that has to made 100% of the time."
reddevils,3dq9o2,pedler,5,Sat Jul 18 19:13:22 2015 UTC,"I was really surprised when he took that shot, considering he had been very unselfish before that, showing some great passes."
reddevils,3dq9o2,omegaxLoL,6,Sat Jul 18 12:55:21 2015 UTC,Yeah his passing was so good and then suddenly the best chance for one and he's a greedy little shit!

reddevils,3dq9o2,monnii99,5,Sat Jul 18 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"Can't find it but if it helps, Young was running on the left and he was in plenty of space, had Memphis passed Young would have been in either a better position to shoot or make a key pass. Memphis chose not to pass and instead shot and it didn't go on target. It was nothing special, just a simple wasted opportunity from a guy keen to impress!"
reddevils,3dq9o2,TheJoshider10,3,Sat Jul 18 13:09:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, it's also possible that Memphis simply didn't see Young"
reddevils,3dq9o2,asteroid_puncher,4,Sat Jul 18 13:53:25 2015 UTC,He was right in front of him and considering the vision he showed throughout the game I highly doubt he didn't see Young. He was just being selfish.

reddevils,3dpy3v,danskzwag,-26,Sat Jul 18 23:30:25 2015 UTC,What? He's 19 not 16. There's been loads of players who're top quality already at 19. He's not at all special for that age.  Have you been following football five minutes?
reddevils,3dpy3v,JuanRiquelme,8,Sat Jul 18 14:40:53 2015 UTC,I hate the mindset that every player should be a star by 19. It's insane.
reddevils,3dpy3v,JGQuintel,-8,Sat Jul 18 15:19:37 2015 UTC,"Except that's not even remotely what I said.  The guy said    His footwork is among the best I've seen for his age.   Which is just simply bullshit, unless he started following football last week. The guy is nothing special for a 19 year old.  I didn't say he's going to be shit because he's not a world class player at 19. I said he's nothing special for a 19 year old. There's a difference."

reddevils,3dpy3v,DevilDonnie,-13,Sat Jul 18 14:44:57 2015 UTC,"So in the 30 years you're followed football you think Perreira's football is better with the ball at his feet than the likes of Messi, Ronaldo, L. Ronaldo, Fabregas, Owen, Rooney, Gotze, Neymar, Raul, Giggs and so many others who were already fantastic footballers at 19?  That's simply bollocks."

reddevils,3dpy3v,JGQuintel,5,Sat Jul 18 15:20:19 2015 UTC,"I appreciate his opinion of the player and happen to agree (too early to tell). However, he's being downvoted for expressing his opinions about the OP and the majority of the sub, who he insults because they differ on the player.   It's one thing to say ""you know, I think people are being hasty, he's not shown he's at an elite level, even for a 19 year old."" That is both true, and a legitimate opinion to hold and express.  However, dismissing others' opinions as deluded, obviously held by people who have no knowledge of football, or those of idiots makes him an asshole. If you hang around the sub, you'll recognize this about the dude: he's often right about football, and an utter fucking twat. He deserves the downvotes he gets here. To his credit, he appears to give no fucks about what others think of him, although he takes it beyond the ""decent member of the community"" level."

reddevils,3dqwh4,Xanian123,9,Sat Jul 18 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"Preseason is a magical time of the year, combining the silly season of transfer rumors with the madness that is the International Champions Cup. The preseason tournament, before contained within the borders of the United States, has now been expanded to include England, Italy, and Mexico. These ""friendly"" matches provide a great platform for overreaction and speculation about the upcoming season and provide much needed entertainment for soccer-deprived fans. After watching Manchester United's first preseason game against Club America of Mexico, I would like to make several observations and predictions about the 2015-16 season that will most likely end up being even more meaningless than the result of the match.  To begin, I'd like to discuss Memphis' new sideburns. I appreciate his commitment to the culture of the team as he tries to emulate Manchester United legend George Best, but somebody should really tell him that he is not a left-footed, Northern Irishman who will be referred to as ""The Fifth Beatle"" and eventually have a glittering career derailed by alcoholism. Many fans would probably prefer a clean-shaven look that indicates he is actually trying to be Cristiano Ronaldo.  Sticking with the subject of hair, Daley Blind has now adopted the infamous ""man-bun."" My theory is that he has been told to do by the management. Just as the purchase of Ji-Sung Park in 2005 exploded United's fandom in East Asia, I believe that Blind's new man-bun is an attempt to capture the support of the American Northwest. Being the marketing genius he is, there is no way that Woodward would pass up an obvious chance to increase shirt sales by targeting the hipster market so prevalent in Portland and Seattle.  Now, let's talk about the pitch at CenturyLink Field (I think the commentators had to sign an agreement to say the name every five minutes or so to increase advertising). Without a subscription to either MUTV or Fox Soccer Go, I was forced to watch the game on a stream. I began watching a MUTV stream, where Lou Macari and his co-commentator (whose name I can't recall) discussed how poor the pitch was. The grass was apparently laid down on top of astro-turf only a few days prior following a concert by One Direction. Even those watching could see the ball take weird hops every so often. Now, when I was forced to switch streams to Fox Sports, the commentators were saying the exact opposite, praising the beautiful field and claiming that any player would love to play on it. Shows what they know. Please Fox, give all of your coverage to NBC.  Moving on to the actual game, there is not much to take away from a team's overall performance in preseason games, as the number of confounding factors is too large. That being said, the individual performances of players are often a more reliable metric of the level of performance that will be on display in competitive matches. There were several players whose performances stood out in a game in which United as a whole did not put in a vintage performance.  The first of these players is Sam Johnstone, who spent last year on loan at Preston North End. With Valdes being omitted from the tour roster and De Gea looking likely to stay for the final year of his contract, it would appear that the second goalkeeper spot is open for the taking. Amidst the rumors that Sergio Romero might be joining the club after an unsuccessful year at Monaco, Johnstone is likely looking to make the spot his own. He made one or two good saves in the first half as well as coming out to clear the ball when it was knocked in behind the United defense. His distribution also looked good. If no other goalkeeper is signed this summer, it would be my belief that he would compete with Anders Lindegaard to be De Gea's back-up and maybe his eventual replacement.  The second of these players is also a youth player. Andreas Pereira, at the ripe age of 19, was United's main attacking threat in the second half. He consistently beat his man while also providing great service from the left wing and from dead balls. Composed on the ball, he broke down the defense time and time again, unfortunately seeing no reward for his efforts. Building upon a productive U21 World Cup, Periera looks the most likely candidate to break through into the first team this year.  Memphis is the last individual player whose performance I felt deserved recognition. Most fans, myself included, probably thought that Memphis would play on the wing, providing pace, guile, and directness that had been somewhat lacking from the attack last year. However, he was deployed in what appeared to be a deep-lying forward role in tandem with Rooney. While it was clear that he possesses great dribbling ability, what was really on display last night was his intelligence as a player and his ability to pick a pass. More than once last night he sliced open the Club America defense with an incisive pass, showing a facet of his game that hadn't been as obvious as his wing play. He grew into the game as the half progressed, and it is clear that he still has room for growth as a player, but his performance will certainly inspire fans of the team.  To conclude, I'd like to make a few observations about the play that don't merit their own paragraph. Mata does not defend well. Whoever is playing right back needs to be ready to defend a lot. Combined with the expectation of overlapping when Mata cuts inside, this position will demand a high level of fitness, and I think that it will be one of the more heavily rotated positions in the team. On the other side, Shaw looks incredibly solid both attacking and defending, and should really have a breakthrough year in the team if he can maintain his fitness. Herrera and Schweinsteiger looked the better midfield pairing, as Carrick did not have his best game. Frequently, United would only have one player in the box when a winger looked up to cross. If a team can be compact and defend well against the quick, short passing moves that are favored by LVG, it could well stifle the attack. Another option at striker could be useful, whether it is Fellaini moving further forward or someone coming in through the transfer market. Finally, the rest of the youth players (McNair, Lingard, Januzaj, Wilson, and Blackett) all looked hungry and willing to fight for spots. With United's depth already improved through the transfer window, I think that it could be further bolstered by youth. It is unlikely that the century-old streak of academy players featuring in the matchday squads will be broken any time soon.  Once again, I want to emphasize that preseason games can be deceiving. The past two years United has begun the season very slowly after looking strong in preseason. Maybe this year will be different, and United will follow up a poor preseason showing by wining the league (and Manchester City and Liverpool will lose their European spots to Stoke and Swansea). Whatever happens, the transfers made already are very exciting and anticipation for the first game of the season against Tottenham has begun to build."

reddevils,3drb7h,edmontom,4,Sat Jul 18 18:39:58 2015 UTC,"LVG probably don't want to pass up on Ashley Young since he had an amazing last season, I'm not sure putting Depay at CAM is a good idea. He can do it, but it's not his speciality. I'd rather have him at the wing or striker position (without rotating)."
reddevils,3drb7h,jammybear,3,Sat Jul 18 18:28:27 2015 UTC,Definitely looked like CAM to me. Seemed like we were playing 4411/4231. Would much rather put Mata at no.10 and have Depay on the right.

reddevils,3drb7h,chowchow123,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"Memphis is a winger by nature. He is fast, loves to take on an opponent and has a lot of tricks up his sleeve. What he lacks is intelligence and creativity. He is not the best at picking out a defense shattering pass nor does he seem to have the vision.   I think LVG wants to develop these qualities in him and if successful, he could become a world class player. Making him play in the position he played today, LVG might have just wanted him to gain some much needed experience. He looked lazy off the ball today and it looked like he was unsure of what his position was, often sticking very close to Rooney. He did have moments of magic with deft flicks and such."

reddevils,3dphw3,DatGuyRich,165,Sat Jul 18 04:54:42 2015 UTC,"My humble player reviews for the first half, it's 6am so not doing 2nd half...yet.  Johnstone - Not easy playin GK when defence are playing a high line AND opposition are pressing high - he looked sharp, alert, confident, good distribution, very encouraging performance  Darmian - Looked solid, assured, very few mistakes. Could have got forward slightly more but that's really nit-picking as he did get forward  Jones - Not as solid, slightly shaky if I'm honest. His touch was what you'd expect for a first pre-season match from someone who's touch isn't their strongest suit. A couple of positional errors but given it's pre season and again, difficulty of playing a high line against that opposition it's forgivable. What he lacked in sharpness he made up for in energy and commitment as ever  Blind - CB obviously not his favoured position, obviously no relationship with Jones there making the CB partnership the weakest link on the pitch. But he's so technically good with an Oxbridge level graduation from the Ajax academy that he can cope anywhere on the pitch. Few mistakes but nothing major  Shaw - Bright start to his season, was up and down the pitch a lot, looked sharp offensively, few question marks defensively but worked hard to compensate for lack of match sharpness. Looked like he could hit the ground running this season following his strong spell at the end of last season. I love Blind but if Shaw improves defensively it will be hard to keep his pace and energy out of the team  Schneiderlin - Scored 5 mins into his debut, what more do you want. Followed it up with his usual hustle and bustle, made tackles, broke up plays, didn't control the midfield with Carrick as much as you would hope but excellent defensively. Very promising.  Carrick - My main man Carrick, whom I rate so highly, wasn't really himself today. Got caught in possession a couple of times (I know, right?) and didn't really dominate in what was a half without much structure or tempo. Improved as the half continued, would probably have controlled the second half comfortably. Young - Could continue to give LVG headaches if he improves on what was a typical Young performance. If he was a fraction more penetrative or cut throat with delivery he would be excellent. Right now he's a handful for defences, but just shy of being a real problem  Mata - Relatively quiet but oh so smooth, slick and sexy when involved. Touch wasn't 100% but looked dangerous whenever involved. Nearly always creates a serious chance. Involved in the vast majority of our most dangerous plays.  Memphis - Improved drastically as the half wore on. Played exactly as you would imagine, fairly selfish, very skilful, high risk football that leads to good chances or lost possesion. Not much in between. He's definitely at the right club as we United fans appreciate these kinds of players. Clearly ambitious and not afraid to shoot when a clear pass is on (should have played Young in). Started to link up with Rooney as the half went on, glimmers, slight glimmers of an understanding.  Rooney - Despite not being involved much, Rooney looks sharp as ever. Could have been a mid-season match. Only problem for Rooney was that playing up top in a scrappy match with no real rhythm he didn't get much ammunition, until towards the end of the half. I foresee a problem if this happens in matches as he has never ever been able to stay on the last line for long if he isn't getting the ball (apart from last season under LVG, actually). Will always drop deep to get on the ball and will require someone else to get in the box. Very confident he will break 2 important records this season tho. All in all a decent half, just my two cents on a very small sample size of football!"
reddevils,3dphw3,superironthorman,38,Sat Jul 18 05:00:46 2015 UTC,"I didn't watch the game,so i really appreciate this review, i hope you make another one for the second half,your analysis was detailed very good..👍🏽"
reddevils,3dphw3,IBENGM,4,Sat Jul 18 05:46:13 2015 UTC,"Lindegaard - I actually felt for him a bit - clearly under instructions to pass the ball out but an even higher press from CA meant there were 3 players marking our backline, who weren't doing much to find space so it got a bit raggedy at times. Defensively looked assured, wasn't threatened much.  McNair - Without doing too much right or wrong I felt encouraged by his performance. I have faith in Paddy. Not much chemistry with Lindgard but that's understandable. Did his 1st team chances no harm and hopefully will get minutes this season  Smalling - Our best defender and definitely led the backline. Along with Basti the only player barking orders on the pitch. Hopefully he continues to grow into the CB he needs to be.  Evans - Not great. Frustrates me because he should be so much better. Learnt the game under Vida n Rio. Comfortable on the ball. Almost two footed .Pacier than he looks. Why has he declined since 2011 when he had a boss season alongside Rio? I don't know. Not seeing anything to reward my faith over the years. You can almost see him second guess himself everytime he's looking for a pass, deciding whether to press or tackle or stand off in defence. Leads to wrong decisions in basic spots.  Blackett - Improved as the half went on but didn't impress me. Given his performances last season he should have been better. Didn't help Evans and Lindegaard out. Didn't find Pereira enough. Looked apprehensive to get involved at times. Harsh analysis maybe but he's better than what he showed. It's more critical than ever for the youngsters to impress any chance you get at the moment given the spending and that just won't cut it.  Pereira - Desperately needs more game time. Real talent. Will no doubt have left LVG wanting to see more.  Lingard - Bright, energetic and wanted to impress. The dynamic of the game didn't really allow him to showcase what he can do. A harsh analysis would say he should have come back and demanded the ball more.  Herrera - Huge Herrera fan so going to be critical. His touch wasn't 100%, physically dominated a couple of times as a result. Basically just rusty. Wasn't the link between Basti and Lingard/Pereira/Januzaj he needed to be. Still hope he features heavily this season despite the signings.   Basti - Creamed a little when I saw him barking orders. So composed, has an extra second on the ball to everyone else on the pitch. Considering he was playing in a very inexperienced side he did well to hold the fort against a feisty opponent. So glad he speaks great English as his leadership more important than his football for us this season.   Januzaj - I have a feeling some people might be critical but I actually liked his performance. Pereira will probably get the plaudits but if his had been a competitive match, he would have been subbed before Januzaj as he was playing a more important football role for the team. Not too fussed about any errors in final third, he looked fit, fast, stronger, and wanted to make things happen. Definite signs of improvement for me after what was a difficult season.   Wilson - Not great. His brain wanted to do the right things but his feet weren't letting it happen for him. Basic poor passing, control and dribbling. Didn't cause any problems for the opposition. I'm on the side of United fans who say we don't necessarily NEED to sign a striker for various reasons but like I said for the defenders, performances like this won't persuade LVG that's the case. But we are United so let's give him another 45 minutes next week and see what he can do!   My overall thoughts are that you can assess each half/the overall match two ways. 1 - lots of rustiness, invididual errors, lack of chemistry, not many clear cut chances, didn't dominate possession - overall could have been a lot better.   OR you can say - 1st pre-season match a lot of basic pre season symptoms. 2 sides of 11 isn't going to give either team enough time to grow into the match and eventually dominate. However, despite the lack of chemistry across the pitch we never looked seriously threatened. Lot's of signings being bled in, lots of youngsters, and overall lots and lots of promise. Won the match against a fit, physical, technically decent team."
reddevils,3dphw3,superironthorman,3,Sat Jul 18 15:19:16 2015 UTC,I felt Memphis was little rusty today. Saw both Darmian and Schneiderlin play there hearts out.

Schweini looked good early on but dropped off towards the end too  Darmian looked like proper RB for us but I feel he needs to bomb forward more. Maybe this 4-2-2-2 formation is limiting the fullback movements because apart from 2-3 plays I didn't see Shaw bombing forward either.  Perreira is talented. Probably the best player in 2nd half for me.  Who the fuck is Blacklett?  Ander needs to go forward more.  Mata was everywhere. Great movements.

reddevils,3dphw3,psiknight99,20,Sat Jul 18 04:58:45 2015 UTC,"A typical pre-season match. People feeling out their roles.   A few interesting points to note:    I didn't expect us to start with a double pivot. Depay was nowhere near comfortable - on the ball and on the field. You could see Rooney and Carrick giving him directions and he was very confused with who to mark. Maybe he would be better as a winger, but seems like LVG was    trying him out as a CAM. Also, just as an after thought - LVG hasn't been known to grow players like Ronaldo ( what Depay keeps saying his heart is on) - he develops much more technical players - Xavi - and I don't know how that dynamic might play out with Depay. You could see Carrick and Schneiderlin run into each other's paths quite a few times. Hopefully this gets better over time. But this partnership seemed very comfortable. So did Schweinsteiger and Herrera.  Both Schneiderlin and Darmian were brilliant at their plays. Darmian was exactly like we expected and Schneiderlin - though started further back than Carrick who initially brought the ball forward, was very comfortable and enthusiastic bringing the ball forward. And how about that goal ? :) You could see how different the second half team was from the first half. Definitely a mixture of the two may be better going forth. But I still feel that the lack of attacking ops in the first half was majorly due to the disconnect of Depay as a CAM. Schweinsteiger was brilliant as well. Though I still felt Herrera should've been playing further up than him.  There was still the issue of us being unable to handle constant pressing. We couldn't string a lot of passes together if we didn't start out from the back. Maybe that changes when we've got more playing time but a concern nonetheless going forward.  Still want to see more of Johnstone before judging him. A few games in the league may be a better indicator."
reddevils,3dphw3,SomebodyReasonable,6,Sat Jul 18 05:11:18 2015 UTC,"Personally I thought Memphis looked comfortable, he just tends to make the risky pass every time. While it is great to watch when it comes off, it results in loosing the ball really often as well. The good news is I firmly believe that we will play a 4-3-3 when the season really gets going. Memphis will be out on the wing where he wants to be and if LVG doesn't want to create a winger, Giggs is there to add in a thing or two that he has picked up over the years."
reddevils,3dphw3,evanm316,4,Sat Jul 18 11:46:55 2015 UTC,"That's a nice review from you but I just wanted to point out that LVG isn't known to produce Ronaldos because there is just 1 Ronaldo and 1 Messi. Players like these come once a century, so that's a tad bit unrealistic."

Do you know who selected Memphis for the Dutch national team and made his career? Even though he was known to connaisseurs, the general Dutch public didn't know much about him: they were shocked at how good he was. He's so happy about the positive influence Van Gaal has had on his career that Van Gaal's intervention tipped the odds for United in the transfer battle.   It's not really a question of whether Van Gaal could develop a Ronaldo. He has already developed a Memphis."

reddevils,3dphw3,macAaronE,6,Sat Jul 18 05:40:55 2015 UTC,Messi is just a freak with his physicality that he doesn't get injured very often despite being fouled a million times a match.

That said, I feel quite optimistic about the year ahead after watching that game (well, really just the first half).  All of the new signings looked good, Schneiderlin particularly. Goal aside, I thought his passing and tackling were superb; he looked like a real presence in the middle. Darmian looked very composed aside from that one hilariously bad pass. Youth wise, Johnstone and Pereira looked the business. No hesitancy coming out at all from Johnstone, which is encouraging to see. One negative that sticks out is that Blind is clearly not a centre-back.  On another note, the officials were absolutely diabolical; you won't see many more clear-cuts penalties than that Blind tackle. I wasn't keen on the intensity that America were playing at either, quite a few nasty challenges for a friendly."

reddevils,3dphw3,Lodbrok__,12,Sat Jul 18 05:12:10 2015 UTC,"Not too much. I think lvg just wants to see who can play striker. I'm not fully convinced he plans on buying another. We have a wealth of talent in midfield, lvg is too smart to not play some variation of the 451/433/4231."
reddevils,3dphw3,macAaronE,3,Sat Jul 18 04:58:13 2015 UTC,Yeah gave Wilson januzaj snd Memphis all time in the role. I'm sure Memphis' role was a bit of shadow and shake'n'bake with Rooney
reddevils,3dphw3,G_Morgan,3,Sat Jul 18 05:06:35 2015 UTC,"No doubt we'll play 4-3-3 w/ single pivot. As you say, the 4-4-2 was to test guys like Memphis and Januzaj up front, although both seemed to be more roaming second strikers so unsure how well that went really."
reddevils,3dphw3,ywhine,4,Sat Jul 18 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"May be he is planning to set us up the way he did with Bayern, Muller slightly behind Olic up top, two holding midfielders, and two wingers."
reddevils,3dphw3,m1r0k0v,2,Sat Jul 18 04:59:58 2015 UTC,"It was about this time last year that we started the 3-5-2, so I think we're at least moving in the right direction."
reddevils,3dphw3,prehighcrap,2,Sat Jul 18 05:04:35 2015 UTC,More of a 4-2-3-1. It was clear to me that the wingers kept looking for the CMs but couldn't find them because they were so deep.  Hope we go with 4-3-3. Suspect it'll be a mixture of the two systems next season.
reddevils,3dphw3,macAaronE,11,Sat Jul 18 10:12:31 2015 UTC,That challenge on Depay was ridiculous
reddevils,3dphw3,minus_one,11,Sat Jul 18 04:58:20 2015 UTC,Shout out to Johnstone. Played well with a leaky backline.
reddevils,3dphw3,Sokkerboi,21,Sat Jul 18 05:07:44 2015 UTC,"Club America is playing so aggressively, lost count of how many bad challenges"
reddevils,3dphw3,ThatStiffyAce,9,Sat Jul 18 04:58:28 2015 UTC,"That's what you're going to get when you play Mexican League teams. MLS teams will have the occasional rogue too in friendlies, but most of their players are more or less starry-eyed that they are on the pitch with superstars."
reddevils,3dphw3,Mandible_Claw,10,Sat Jul 18 05:09:17 2015 UTC,"1) Fantastic to see the lads back!  2) Schneiderlin, Pereira were the best  3) Darmian, Lingard, Schweini, Evans, Smalling, McNair were decent  4) Memphis is yet to wake up, but its okay. Its just the first game.  5) Liked the second half more than the first half. More fluidity, more speed and more chances."
reddevils,3dphw3,KlausJanVanWolfhaus,38,Sat Jul 18 05:02:10 2015 UTC,That Blacklett guy looked okay
reddevils,3dphw3,itsandercontrol,24,Sat Jul 18 04:55:09 2015 UTC,"""Who do you think was better Herrera or Pereira?""  ""It has to be number 44 for me, definitely."""
reddevils,3dphw3,crackfox21,17,Sat Jul 18 04:58:45 2015 UTC,Who is this Smallings guy?
reddevils,3dphw3,use_the_schwartz,2,Sat Jul 18 04:55:46 2015 UTC,"Meh, left Evans alone & vulnerable. He's got some growing to do. Send him on loan."
reddevils,3dphw3,matt_the_human,8,Sat Jul 18 05:32:17 2015 UTC,Peirera played really well and I'm hoping he gets a huge run in the team this season. Januzaj also played well and Wilson's positioning was a bit off but rather decent performance from him.
reddevils,3dphw3,pyroSeven,7,Sat Jul 18 05:19:39 2015 UTC,Johnstone's been watching videos of Neuer. Off his line so fast three or four times
reddevils,3dphw3,BackhandQ,8,Sat Jul 18 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"Was at the match. Morgan is legit. He covered at left back when Shaw bombed forward, he tackled well and he had some beautiful cross field passes. He was impressive in every way."
reddevils,3dphw3,devil27,8,Sat Jul 18 06:20:24 2015 UTC,Did anyone else see the dancing semi-naked black guy just before the second half started?
reddevils,3dphw3,BackhandQ,2,Sat Jul 18 04:57:58 2015 UTC,"Yup, wtf was that?"
reddevils,3dphw3,mkenya4t,7,Sat Jul 18 12:41:12 2015 UTC,"First match of the pre-season tour so the players were exceptionally rusty and looked slow for the majority of the game. Thats to be expected. The performances will get far better by the end of this US tour.   Pereira was the best player on the pitch for me. Looked energetic, creative and showed hunger to win the ball and do something with it. Whereas I thought Lingard and Januzaj left much to be desired. But again, it's just the first match so I'm not trying to be overly harsh. Just commenting on what I saw during the 90.  Darmian looked quite good. Once he gets into game shape and can get a taste of the pace in the EPL, he'll be a solid RB for us.   Schneiderlin was probably the best performer of the night when looking at the newcomers to the squad. Besides the goal, which he took quite well from a floated delivery, I thought he was strong and poised in the middle of the park. Just what he does and needs to do for the entire campaign. Such a tough lad on the ball, splendid ball recovery and passing.   And yes.. It was Amazing to see Schweinsteiger in the red of Manchester United!! Love it! And also interesting how Van Gaal gave him a run out with the youth of the team as opposed to being with more of the first teamers. Lets see if that trend continues or just a one game tactic."
reddevils,3dphw3,DisgracedCubFan,6,Sat Jul 18 05:40:55 2015 UTC,"I thought Lingard, Perreira, and McNair looked very good."
reddevils,3dphw3,pobmufc,3,Sat Jul 18 05:43:42 2015 UTC,"I agree with McNair. He looked confident at both ends of the pitch. Idk about Lingard, perhaps I'm being harsh, just didn't see the pace and dribbling from him (although could be due to the lack of time on the ball)"
reddevils,3dphw3,mkenya4t,32,Sat Jul 18 07:50:57 2015 UTC,Darmian & Schneiderlin were both excellent.   We definitely need a better striking option besides Rooney.
reddevils,3dphw3,soundthealarm21,4,Sat Jul 18 04:55:45 2015 UTC,That second sentence can be interpreted a few different ways. It really confused me.
reddevils,3dphw3,boredatworkinSK,7,Sat Jul 18 05:07:00 2015 UTC,"I thought Wilson did alright. Could have been better positioned for opportunities in the box, but outside the box he didn't do much wrong."
reddevils,3dphw3,shades3370,16,Sat Jul 18 04:58:44 2015 UTC,"One of the commentators pointed out about his pace - first approach. That said, our style of play really does isolate the strikers..They get little service."
reddevils,3dphw3,10people,3,Sat Jul 18 05:03:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like someone with experience would've been on the far post after Herrera headed it across. It's that instinct to know Herrera is going to head it back. Several times his positioning was off and it was a lost opportunity, but that'll come with time."
reddevils,3dphw3,Jeuj,3,Sat Jul 18 05:07:10 2015 UTC,"Someone like Chicharito, perhaps?"
reddevils,3dphw3,MonsieurRyan,2,Sat Jul 18 05:19:10 2015 UTC,I dont think we can afford to go into the season with him as the 2nd striker. Hes quick but i think itll be best if we let him develop at his own pace
reddevils,3dphw3,Cuban_Mahogany,15,Sat Jul 18 05:08:17 2015 UTC,Darmian looked pretty solid. Might be the best buy
reddevils,3dphw3,MonsieurRyan,6,Sat Jul 18 04:57:03 2015 UTC,Find me Bastian's passing stats.  :D
reddevils,3dphw3,Cuban_Mahogany,30,Sat Jul 18 04:56:46 2015 UTC,"MUTV commentary said something like ""he is playing like he has a cigar in his mouth"""
reddevils,3dphw3,m1r0k0v,9,Sat Jul 18 05:00:01 2015 UTC,I can think of a certain Bulgarian who mastered that art.

reddevils,3dphw3,Crais,5,Sat Jul 18 05:07:59 2015 UTC,Genuinely one of my favourite players of all time. His first touch just put everyone elses to shame.
reddevils,3dphw3,McGrifty,6,Sat Jul 18 05:12:26 2015 UTC,Why can't American commentators make comments like that?
reddevils,3dphw3,s_D088z,6,Sat Jul 18 05:11:15 2015 UTC,Not sure. That's why I decided to watch an MUTV stream instead of Fox Sports 1.
reddevils,3dphw3,inu50kza,8,Sat Jul 18 05:14:13 2015 UTC,"He was so calm - like he was moving in slow motion, but never lost the ball. He is so composed its amazing"
reddevils,3dphw3,sanford_bc,13,Sat Jul 18 05:04:05 2015 UTC,Everyone praising Darmain but imagine if that was Valencias error?
reddevils,3dphw3,macAaronE,5,Sat Jul 18 04:56:24 2015 UTC,"He's being praised because aside from that error he had a very good half. Pressed forward very well and for the most part was very defensively astute. These are things Valencia wasn't consistent with in competitive games, never mind preseason."
reddevils,3dphw3,AJMcCoy612,4,Sat Jul 18 05:04:55 2015 UTC,"He has a point though. Valencia's usually just as solid but if he makes one error you'll get a slew of ""not a natural RB"" or ""he's an athlete but clearly keeps getting caught out of position.  I think Darmian's a shade better defensively but Valencia's had a lot of matches last season better than this on attack and defence and been heavily criticised.   Just pre-season and I'm sure he'll grow into the role but I don't think Valencia's a bad RB option to have at all."
reddevils,3dphw3,s_D088z,10,Sat Jul 18 13:22:49 2015 UTC,"Bastian could have scored an own goal and I would have been crying in happiness. The fact that Bastian Fucking Schweinsteiger just played a game as a Red makes me so happy. And this isn't to neglect the other signings, but Bastian Fucking Schweinsteiger."
reddevils,3dphw3,pouria_t,3,Sat Jul 18 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"All four of the new signings had positive starts. Hard to say who looked the best. It's like choosing between your kids. Pereira looked the most eager to impress, and the youth in general looked lively. Lingard didn't put a foot wrong. Januzaj was unlucky not to score.  Lindegaard and Carrick were among the few who didn't look as hot. Smalling lapsed too."
reddevils,3dphw3,DemonSpeed,5,Sat Jul 18 05:02:16 2015 UTC,"Schneiderlin was definitely the player of the first half. Pereira the player of the second half.   Darmian looked solid, few fantastic runs forward that Valencia wouldn't have dreamt of.   Memphis had flashes of brilliance, looked a tad selfish but you can put that down to wanting to prove himself so early. Ronaldo was like that at the start.  Schweinsteiger was everything I hoped he would be, controlled the game and looked for the smart pass.   Johnstone threw his towel in for a chance at being our number two, who needs Romero if he can keep that up. Needs to do it again though, give him League Cup games to prove himself.   All in all I'm very happy, onto the next one!"
reddevils,3dphw3,MySeaTurtleGreg,5,Sat Jul 18 05:02:18 2015 UTC,"Definitely some positives to take out of the game. Schneiderlin, Darmian, Memphis and Schweinsteiger all looked good. Memphis, Rooney and Mata looked like they were developing some chemistry as did Herrera and Schweinsteiger. Also noticed a Schneiderlin-Schweinsteiger-Herrera midfield trio could work very well together. Schneiderlin looked a great 6, Schweinsteiger an 8 and Herrera a 10 (played a more defensive mid this match but we've seen his ability when attacking)."
reddevils,3dphw3,mkenya4t,4,Sat Jul 18 05:02:28 2015 UTC,It was beautiful to watch Schneiderlin making those diagonal passes. Haven't seen too many of those since Scholes retired.
reddevils,3dphw3,moreoftoe88,4,Sat Jul 18 05:19:50 2015 UTC,"Johnstone:  definitely not afraid to go after the ball or handle it with his feet.  Let their striker get a little too close for comfort before kicking it downfield on several occassions.  But, cool as a cucumber even when things got dicey like the time he slipped collecting the back pass.  Darmian:  I think we're going love him.  Didn't do a lot going forward, but showed good anticipation a few times to win back the ball.   Memphis:  didnt play in his best position and Wasn't on the same page as Rooney, but he looked lively and dangerous.   Schneiderlin:  leading scorer in the Schmidfield so far  Schweinsteiger :a man among boys.  Literally.  Rooney: is Wayne Rooney  Perreira: looked dangerous on the wing except for the few times he ran himself into trouble.  Shaw:  looked rusty  Blind: played out of position so it's not fair to judge too harshly, but he didn't have a great night.  Januzaj:  looks like he spent a little time in the gym over the summer.  He's not massive, but he doesn't look like a stick figure anymore.  Showed spirit and fought through some tackles.  His aim was just a wee bit off or he would have scored.  Wilson: I swear I heard a sonic boom on one of his runs.  That speed could come in handy against some tired Kompany legs.  Blackett: is apparently named Backlit"
reddevils,3dphw3,_TheOneWhoKnocks_,7,Sat Jul 18 11:57:49 2015 UTC,"Morgan was incredible in midfield just ripping balls off of people's feet then delivering a great pass.  Matteo on the right might've been the brightest spot for me tonight, he tracks back great and is so comfortable with both feet. I guess this is what it feels like to have a real RB playing.   Every time Memphis got on the ball I moved to the edge of my seat. He is so creative and plays with a certain swagger that I've missed. His vision is incredible and when he and Rooney get their timing down on some of his runs it is going to be a thrill to see.   Andreas Pereira looks like an absolute gem. He is so spry and fluid with the ball that if we can get him game time and develop he will be world class.   Wilson though looked like he was trying to move too fast for his own good. Seemed off page or just a step out of sync with everyone else. Im sure that will improve as the summer progresses.  Just some of my points of emphasis from the match. All in all Im incredibly thrilled with it and am extremely excited as we continue. I really think with the edition of a class CB we will make alot of noise this year!"

reddevils,3dphw3,chocolaidbrowie,3,Sat Jul 18 04:57:11 2015 UTC,Darmian looked extremely solid in his position. Schneiderlin intercepts EVERYTHING. Pereira can be the next big thing

reddevils,3dphw3,StannisJr,3,Sat Jul 18 05:02:07 2015 UTC,Schneiderlin and Perreira were the standout performers.  Have to praise Club America's constant pressure. Made it tough to get anything going.

reddevils,3dphw3,abkalu9,2,Sat Jul 18 05:02:59 2015 UTC,"The 2nd half team, clearly was more lively than the first half's.  However, they lack the decision making.  The youngsters certainly have a bright future ahead of them. Their chemistry is already taking form.  Pierera to be the next Wazza. He was everywhere, defending, attacking, interceptions in midfield. Huge amounts of potential, hopefully not destroyed by shite discipline.   Schweinsteiger in a United shirt.  Memphis created quite a few chances. Has good control of the ball as well. Though, it could have been 2-0 if he slotted it to Young.  Overall good performance. I would love it if we could get Mata and Hererra playing together again."
reddevils,3dphw3,iShantSonuley,2,Sat Jul 18 05:05:51 2015 UTC,New here. And admittedly a casual fan.  That guy perreira looked awesome. Will he see serious playing time? Januzaj?  Will chicharito start this year?  It was only 1-0 but i have a good feeling about this year.  I think its awesome we got shweinsteiger hes a winner and that can only help us.  I think it sucks if we dont have degea anymore but lindegaard played well from what i saw
reddevils,3dphw3,MonsieurRyan,2,Sat Jul 18 05:29:17 2015 UTC,I'm in no way comfortable even guessing at a lineup when LVG threw out the team in 4-4-2.  That was a surprise to me.

reddevils,3dphw3,cloudbreaker81,3,Sat Jul 18 10:32:08 2015 UTC,I think the commentators should stop saying 'schweinsteiger' and just start saying 'fußballgott' whenever he has the ball
reddevils,3dqo3f,kiwwi191,13,Sat Jul 18 14:55:42 2015 UTC,I thought he was the most ready of all the players physically and mentally. He looked sharp and ready to play. I was very impressed.

reddevils,3dpwa7,Cuban_Mahogany,8,Sat Jul 18 18:33:21 2015 UTC,I actually think Rooney and Zlatan would link up reaaally well.
reddevils,3dpwa7,PastorPanda,35,Sat Jul 18 10:05:49 2015 UTC,I'd say it would be poor. Much like how Rooney didn't gel well with Berbatov or Van Persie.  Edit: Rooney has not had a good partnership with a player like Zlatan. Rooney at his best is up front on his own or behind a fast striker.
reddevils,3dpwa7,WillyMorganOnTheWing,27,Sat Jul 18 11:50:24 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're downvoted.  Easily Rooney's best partners were Saha, Welbeck and Hernandez.  Guys who want to drop deep a little more or don't have that pace in behind to make space like RVP, Tevez and Berbatov he'd never really had great partnerships with."
reddevils,3dpwa7,JuanRiquelme,6,Sat Jul 18 12:03:51 2015 UTC,He had a brilliant partnership with tevez.
reddevils,3dpwa7,johnsom3,2,Sat Jul 18 16:16:30 2015 UTC,Nope. Not at all.   We won a lot of stuff because of Rooney/Ronaldo partnership and our defence but Rooney/Tevez never really clicked hence why SAF wanted Berbatov.
reddevils,3dpwa7,JuanRiquelme,4,Sat Jul 18 16:17:41 2015 UTC,"I don't know why he wanted berbatov, but it wasn't because tevez failed or anything. Bringing in berba was a mistake especially since it came at the expense of tevez.   I also think your massively underrating teve contribution for us winning the double. There is a reason it was called the holy Trinity."
reddevils,3dpwa7,johnsom3,-2,Sat Jul 18 16:23:36 2015 UTC,"Tevez was decent, Rooney was decent.  But as a partnership they never consistently linked well.  Just like RVP/Rooney in SAF's last season. We won the league but never a good partnership."
reddevils,3dpwa7,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:53:13 2015 UTC,"Really the only instance I can think of Rooney and Tevez being on the same wavelength is that goal against Middlesborough. Rooney and Tevez both prefer dropping a bit deeper, they can't form a good partnership if they're both occupying the same positions and have similar qualities. Strikers are supposed to compliment each other, not get in each other's way.  Sweet goal though."
reddevils,3dpwa7,ParkerZA,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:52:21 2015 UTC,The partnership back then was all three unless we were playing weak teams but back then against big teams it was Rooney+Ronaldo+Tevez with Rooney out left. Even the season before that it wasn't really a Rooney and Ronaldo partnership. Rooney and Saha played a lot of games together and Solskjaer filled in some with Ronaldo destroying teams on the left on his own. That front three still worked well as it allowed Roanldo to do what he wanted with Rooney filling in left and Tevez coming deep and working hard and scoring key goals.   Rooney/Tevez never really clicked hence why SAF wanted Berbatov.   You can't really say what SAF was thinking but he had shown in previous transfers he would buy a player if he thought he was special regardless of what he had. He bought Veron even though we had Keane and Scholes. He tried to get Lewandowski even though we had RVP and said ' I can find room for anybody here as long as they have the required quality '
reddevils,3dpwa7,BigCheeser,2,Sat Jul 18 18:22:05 2015 UTC,I think people misconstrue statements like mine as saying I don't rate him. Whereas I am simply saying he has better chemistry with fast strikers who like to run in behind the defence. He's not as suited to sharing space with a player like Berbatov or Van Persie. The team is not as good then. It's been the same for him with England.

reddevils,3dpwa7,JuanRiquelme,7,Sat Jul 18 15:39:44 2015 UTC,i thought he did well with RVP during that title winning campaign.
reddevils,3dpwa7,nomoretearz,10,Sat Jul 18 12:14:45 2015 UTC,That's just van Persie being van Persie
reddevils,3dpwa7,LevynX,2,Sat Jul 18 12:20:42 2015 UTC,There was one stat during the match that the only pass RVP made to Rooney was during Kickoff

reddevils,3dpwa7,Mickyutjs,3,Sat Jul 18 18:52:40 2015 UTC,He was pretty damn good playing behind RVN.
reddevils,3dpwa7,lippyjose,2,Sat Jul 18 14:39:10 2015 UTC,He wasn't especially excellent IMO. Van Persie's finishing carried United in Ferguson's final season. I don't think they complemented each other that well bar the odd moment.
reddevils,3dpwa7,WillyMorganOnTheWing,2,Sat Jul 18 15:55:09 2015 UTC,Van Nistelrooy.  I think you may have read RVN as RVP
reddevils,3dpwa7,lippyjose,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:57:37 2015 UTC,Indeed I did. I think he was much better with Saha than Van Nistelrooy. The whole team was better.

We need someone like Marco Reus, who can beat a man in closed spaces and create something out of nothing, a lot like Lionel Messi just not as good as him, but a team player as well. I'm sure Marco Reus will have great understanding with Rooney, just like Ronaldo and Tevez used to have."
reddevils,3dpwa7,baggios_ponytail,3,Sat Jul 18 12:54:06 2015 UTC,Zlatan can't dribble?
reddevils,3dpwa7,johnsom3,2,Sat Jul 18 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"Can Zlatan produce a performance like Marco Reus did against Real Madrid in UCL semi-final? You can see his performance here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQg7Ruf1aoU  I can't genuinely remember Zlatan dribbling against great defenders or producing truly match-winning performances against absolute top opponents. Neymar, Messi, Suarez, Reus etc. have done that, but never Zlatan."
reddevils,3dpwa7,baggios_ponytail,19,Sat Jul 18 16:33:28 2015 UTC,Maybe Pedro? Maybe he wants to use him as a striker
reddevils,3dpwa7,d2a_sandman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:02:20 2015 UTC,I don't think his finishing is good enough. Better on the wing
reddevils,3dpwa7,omegaxLoL,15,Sat Jul 18 12:07:48 2015 UTC,Pep Guardiola said that Pedro was the best finisher in his squad apart from Messi. So I think he is good enough at finishing.
reddevils,3dpwa7,Evilpotatohead,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:10:21 2015 UTC,"Well he doesn't think so and this was years ago anyway. The downvotes are stupid. Pedro is a winger. If our arguments are made on what Pep fucking Guardiola thinks (which is the silliest thing ever, can't we all have our own opinion and base it on something instead of just repeating someone else?) then we know Pedro is best used as a winger. Since he was always used as a winger."
reddevils,3dpwa7,El_Giganto,2,Sat Jul 18 18:02:04 2015 UTC,I'm not the one down voting. I agree we can all have our own opinions. My comment was more to point out to the guy why people might be wrongly down voting him.   The comment was made a while ago but I don't think it means that pedro has become a bad finisher.
reddevils,3dpwa7,Evilpotatohead,7,Sat Jul 18 18:47:47 2015 UTC,I've always seen Pedro as a really clinical finisher.

reddevils,3dugqy,WhatAreThooose,16,Sun Jul 19 16:21:37 2015 UTC,"Mine would be Carrick - Schneiderlin - Herrera which allows herrera more freedom to roam with two DM. And also schweinsteiger replacing carrick at like the 60 minute mark to not overuse carrick which means he can play up until like 36-38.   Schweini is better than Carrick. Should be the other way around. Schweini is 31, Carrick is 34.  I'd rather have Schweini, Herrera, Schneiderlin and then Schweini being replaced by Carrick around the 60 min mark."
reddevils,3dugqy,Surilliar,2,Sun Jul 19 16:30:43 2015 UTC,I agree except I think Carrick will begin the season as the starter as Schweini gets acclimated to the system and team. I'm just so happy we have so many options.
reddevils,3dugqy,Malachi_-_Constant,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry i misunderstood schweini's position. I though he was a more box to box, thats why i said carrick should be swapped with schweini so schneiderlin can play DM"
reddevils,3dugqy,Surilliar,3,Sun Jul 19 16:57:23 2015 UTC,"Schweini can play DM, but it doesn't matter does it? If Schneiderlin plays DM, have Herrera and Schweini in front and then swap Schweini with Carrick, which means Schneiderlin plays further forward and Carrick plays DM."
reddevils,3dugqy,SonnyisKing,3,Sun Jul 19 17:08:38 2015 UTC,I think we will play Schweinstieger and Schneiderlin as 2 holding midfielders and either Mata or Herrera playing as the advanced midfielder.
reddevils,3dugqy,GroteBergMan98,4,Sun Jul 19 16:48:39 2015 UTC,You can quote me on this that our midfield 3 will be:  Schweinsteiger  Herrera-Schneiderlin  Usually pretty good at predicting LVG line-ups.
reddevils,3dugqy,RedDevil237025,2,Sun Jul 19 16:30:31 2015 UTC,Exactly what he'll start with
reddevils,3dugqy,DelusionalThomas666,0,Sun Jul 19 16:34:49 2015 UTC,Sorry but this wouldve been my go to lineup if i knew that schweinsteiger is a defendive midfielder. You can quote me too:)

reddevils,3dugqy,Hassi94,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:30 2015 UTC,"Carrick is too far gone to still be playing at 38. No way. By the sounds of things he won't be getting a further extension to his contract. This season will be his last at United, at least in a playing capacity,  Also, these threads get posted several times a day. Try searching best midfield trio or midfield lineup etc, on the sub."
reddevils,3dugqy,Hassi94,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:24:34 2015 UTC,"Sorry for posting it again. But i completely disagree, he can play at least two more seasons if we interchange our midfield and not depend on him."
reddevils,3dugqy,Feezbull,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:27:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll be much use past next season. I'd rather the 5 games a year he might play go to a youth player instead. Schweinsteiger is the better player so why do we need Carrick for 'big games' or whatever?   I feel like he'll probably retire at the end of this season and become a coach at United, Van Gaal seems to put a lot of faith in his brain and said he thinks he could make a good manager."
reddevils,3dugqy,maydaybomber,0,Sun Jul 19 16:34:36 2015 UTC,Isnt schweinsteiger like a box to box midfielder
reddevils,3dugqy,mkenya4t,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:54:34 2015 UTC,"Van Gaal considers him a holding midfielder, just like how Carrick was played last season."
reddevils,3dugqy,nqmt,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:05:43 2015 UTC,Sure but that's the problem we faced with scholes and giggs to begin with. Use them till their legs can no longer hold and then be left with a huge hole in our team that needs instant fixing.
reddevils,3dugqy,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:32:37 2015 UTC,"Schwiensteiger, Schneiderlin and Herrera would be the 3 I go with."
reddevils,3dugqy,youngsaha,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:16:53 2015 UTC,"Is there supposed to be a question in here?   That said.. I feel Schneiderlin will be a better swap for Carrick, he can play a deeper holding role as he did at Southampton . Bastian and Herrera would play a bit forward and help with attacking. I do forsee us playing with a 4-2-3-1 at times."
reddevils,3dugqy,simplyevert,0,Sun Jul 19 16:26:24 2015 UTC,"Even though this topic has been discussed ad nauseam, i feel there should be a daily thread about this."
reddevils,3dugqy,JaMax90,0,Sun Jul 19 16:26:30 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I want Schwiensteiger more pushed up or Schneiderlin and I think it's close than most think - Basti is notorious for being best when he can roam freely forward (in the Fellaini role) and lurk around the edge of the box with his physicality, long shot and accurate passing. He's not the tried and tested number 6 people seem to assume even though I'm sure he can play there. Him and Herrera ahead of Morgan offer more creativity and attacking threat than Herrera and Schneiderlin."
reddevils,3dugqy,AchillesBeauty13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:57:02 2015 UTC,based on your comment you have never seen Schweinsteiger play.
reddevils,3dugqy,TY1901,0,Sun Jul 19 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"I think Carrick and Schneiderlin are too similar to play together. Mt prefered trio would be Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger and Herrera"
reddevils,3dpt66,Feezbull,27,Sat Jul 18 07:15:59 2015 UTC,"Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has outlined the scouting process at Manchester United and detailed how the club conducts its incoming transfer business.  Woodward has overseen deals to acquire Matteo Darmian, Memphis Depay, Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger this summer and the work to identify targets clearly takes some time. Admitting it is a ""relentless"" pursuit of fresh talent, he reveals a shortlist is drawn up for each position targeted.   When asked to detail the process involved, he said in an extensive and exclusive interview with MUTV: ""It’s actually fairly straightforward. We have a global scouting network that’s all over many countries and key markets from a football perspective. The scouts are watching matches and we have a huge amount of data we purchase and a pyramid approach in terms of delivering that information to our chief scout and his team who are assessing it.   ""So we’re always able to look at a position and have our view in terms of the list of targets that we think will suit Manchester United and help our team. That list is then discussed with Louis [van Gaal] and his staff and there’s a process of further analysis done.   ""Once Louis sets his targets – and I think it’s always important to have more than one target for each position, because you have to accept that sometimes you may not get your first choice for whatever reason, so let’s plan ahead and look at two and three – then all I do is go and negotiate the deals with the club and the player. It’s straightforward, although it may not be easy in terms of negotiations.""  Once the transfer deadline has passed at the end of August, work will already start on assessing potential targets for 2016. The planning is clearly fundamental to ensuring United have a squad capable of competing for top honours.  ""It’s really September,"" Woodward replied, when asked when the whole process starts. ""Once the window closes, your scouts are then starting to look at the key areas where you think you may have a weakness and the whole process starts. The manager will have had four more months of working with the squad [by January] and have had much better visibility of who the ins and outs should be, but the work has to have started to get them.  ""Yes, essentially there is [a physical list of names] because we track everything. That's what the scouting team does. It's relentless because you're immediately focused on the next [signing]. To that extent, I am completely aligned with the fans. When we tell them we’ve signed a player, there is a moment of happiness but then it’s about who’s next.   ""There is a lot of work involved in terms of negotiations and that is time-consuming, so I prefer to look back at it at the end of the window, see the players on the pitch and see how they’ve been blended into the squad."""

reddevils,3dp4e2,yiyiyiyi,11,Sat Jul 18 03:59:51 2015 UTC,Have to admit Schweinsteiger looks much sharper than I thought he would. Really enjoying seeing him.
reddevils,3dp4e2,s_D088z,9,Sat Jul 18 04:41:23 2015 UTC,Darmian has looked thr best of all the players first half
reddevils,3dp4e2,ballboy007,10,Sat Jul 18 03:51:04 2015 UTC,Memphis is going to be one hell of a player.
reddevils,3dp4e2,heyliberty,8,Sat Jul 18 03:51:45 2015 UTC,Blacklett? This announcer is getting on my nerves.
reddevils,3dp4e2,shtzkrieg,11,Sat Jul 18 04:12:41 2015 UTC,"My humble player reviews for the first half:  Johnstone - Not easy playin GK when defence are playing a high line AND opposition are pressing high - he looked sharp, alert, confident, good distribution, very encouraging performance  Darmian - Looked solid, assured, very few mistakes. Could have got forward slightly more but that's really nit-picking as he did get forward   Jones - Not as solid, slightly shaky if I'm honest. His touch was what you'd expect for a first pre-season match from someone who's touch isn't their strongest suit. A couple of positional errors but given it's pre season and again, difficulty of playing a high line against that opposition it's forgivable. What he lacked in sharpness he made up for in energy and commitment as ever  Blind - CB obviously not his favoured position, obviously no relationship with Jones there making the CB partnership the weakest link on the pitch. But he's so technically good with an Oxbridge level graduation from the Ajax academy that he can cope anywhere on the pitch. Few mistakes but nothing major  Shaw - Bright start to his season, was up and down the pitch a lot, looked sharp offensively, few question marks defensively but worked hard to compensate for lack of match sharpness. Looked like he could hit the ground running this season following his strong spell at the end of last season. I love Blind but if Shaw improves defensively it will be hard to keep his pace and energy out of the team  Schneiderlin - Scored 5 mins into his debut, what more do you want. Followed it up with his usual hustle and bustle, made tackles, broke up plays, didn't control the midfield with Carrick as much as you would hope but excellent defensively. Very promising.   Carrick - My main man Carrick, whom I rate so highly, wasn't really himself today. Got caught in possession a couple of times (I know, right?) and didn't really dominate in what was a half without much structure or tempo. Improved as the half continued, would probably have controlled the second half comfortably.   Young - Could continue to give LVG headaches if he improves on what was a typical Young performance. If he was a fraction more penetrative or cut throat with delivery he would be excellent. Right now he's a handful for defences, but just shy of being a real problem   Mata  - Relatively quiet but oh so smooth, slick and sexy when involved. Touch wasn't 100% but looked dangerous whenever involved. Nearly always creates a serious chance. Involved in the vast majority of our  most dangerous plays.   Memphis - Improved drastically as the half wore on. Played exactly as you would imagine, fairly selfish, very skilful, high risk football that leads to good chances or lost possesion. Not much in between. He's definitely at the right club as we United fans appreciate these kinds of players. Clearly ambitious and not afraid to shoot when a clear pass is on (should have played Young in). Started to link up with Rooney as the half went on, glimmers, slight glimmers of an understanding.   Rooney - Despite not being involved much, Rooney looks sharp as ever. Could have been a mid-season match. Only problem for Rooney was that playing up top in a scrappy match with no real rhythm he didn't get much ammunition, until towards the end of the half. I foresee a problem if this happens in matches as he has never ever been able to stay on the last line for long if he isn't getting the ball (apart from last season under LVG, actually). Will always drop deep to get on the ball and will require someone else to get in the box. Very confident he will break 2 important records this season tho.   All in all a decent half, just my two cents on a very small sample size of football!"

I really, really like the look of Schneiderlin in the midfield. Defensive range and passing range both."

I can see how his play style might wear on people when things aren't coming off but damn it if it isn't awesome when they do. It is going to be fun to watch him for a long time to come.  Darmian has been solid enough, supporting the rest of the team as we move forward. He supports but he is always (at least so far) in position to defend at a moment's notice.   Schneiderlin has impressed me the most of all. His positioning is very good so far. Always in the right place to break up play or provide an outlet. Exactly what was needed considering Carrick can't play forever."

reddevils,3dp4e2,Crusty_Gammon_Flaps,4,Sat Jul 18 03:58:08 2015 UTC,"Team definitely looks like it's coming off a break, but the tempo and understanding in the team will improve with more game time.   Schneiderlin and Carrick has been an interesting pairing, with Carrick not exclusively coming deeper for the ball and bringing it up the pitch as he has done in the past. Both played almost too similarly at times, moving instinctively to track the same runner, and Carrick looked a little out of sorts when playing higher up, although that may have just been due to the break. Schneiderlin looked quite comfortable, willing to engage for the ball when necessary and displaying a nice range of passing. With the two central midfielders deeper, and Rooney looking like he was tasked as the furthest forward, I would've liked to see Depay work more to find space between the America players to receive the ball. Provided some eye-catching flicks and creativity, but the way he received the ball was more reminiscent of a winger with more time and space than a second striker/#10 role. Would have liked to see Mata swap into the central position for a longer period of time - provided some good late runs into the box, but his ability to influence the game is definitely hindered out wide. Darmian also looked, for the most part, quite comfortable, caught out a couple of times but solid in possession. Always looked to try and quicken the tempo and move the ball faster, which is promising."

I remember he had great reflexes but his presence in the box and physicality left much to be desired. We moulded him into who he is now, why couldn't we do the same with Cillessen?"
reddevils,3dqgef,Hat-trickBlunt,26,Sat Jul 18 14:26:17 2015 UTC,De Gea was 20 when he came to OT. Cillessen is 26 now. There's alot that can happen in 6 years. Thats probably why.
reddevils,3dqgef,Allard1994,6,Sat Jul 18 14:51:36 2015 UTC,Had no idea he was that old
reddevils,3dqgef,sepehrack,12,Sat Jul 18 15:16:43 2015 UTC,"I must admit, he looks very young. If you didnt know better, you'd think he's the same age as Dave."
reddevils,3dqgef,Allard1994,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:44:15 2015 UTC,"Interesting, didn't realize he was that old.   To counter, wasn't Van Der Sar 34 when he joined us from Fulham? Granted, I don't know how VdS at 34 compares to Cillessen at 26, but we got 6 great seasons out of Edwin. De Gea showed a lot of potential at such a young age but I think keepers like VdS and Buffon have shown that age is less of a factor for a keeper."
reddevils,3dqgef,Hat-trickBlunt,4,Sat Jul 18 16:45:32 2015 UTC,vds was a European champion had an unbeaten season was in back to back CL finals and winning shit loads of trophies with LvG at ajax at age 20.   he only left juve because of politics when buffon was bought. a bit like the courtois cech situation only vds was better than cech and buffon wasn't as good as courtois at the time.   the whole Fulham thing was a weird end of career sojourn but it was clear he was still easily the best keeper in the league.    I like cillessen but he's just not good enough
reddevils,3dqgef,inu50kza,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:14:30 2015 UTC,"You can search ""Louis van Gaal's 90s Ajax team"" and see the name of the goalkeeper during that period  United had already sought Edwin to succeed the great Danish giant. He chose Juventus, however, and was always first choice, had it not been for the arrival of Buffon to Juve for a world-record fee (must buy the best Italian GK policy)  He moved to Fulham, and again, SAF went for him for a second time. The rest is history.  Edwin has always been a proven name everywhere, unlike Cilessen."
reddevils,3dqgef,reddevfan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:52:50 2015 UTC,"Along with what the other guy said, De Gea had massive potential and was playing for a solid team in a solid league. He was known for pulling off some amazing saves and he was essentially the finished product with his reflexes and diving, with him needing to work on positioning and commanding his box which comes with age and experience in a physical league.   In comparison Cillessen is 26, still playing for Ajax, is absolute wank with penalties (sure De Gea isn't the best saver of them, but Cillessen dives the right way and never fucking gets it) and overall it doesn't feel like at his best he'll ever reach the heights you expect from a United GK."
reddevils,3dqgef,TheJoshider10,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:21:12 2015 UTC,"Well, saving penalties is pretty hard. Diego Alves from Valencia is a superb penalty stopper. Maybe Cillessen should ask him for advice :P"
reddevils,3dqgef,Allard1994,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"I know that, but still he just had no confidence with them. He would dive the right way then faff at the ball. Just didn't seem to have the reach or the reactions to get to them, and it made him look like an amateur. Felt for the guy."
reddevils,3dqgef,TheJoshider10,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:54:56 2015 UTC,Yeah it looks like he just falls either way when the player shoots.
reddevils,3dqgef,Allard1994,7,Sat Jul 18 17:15:46 2015 UTC,"JASPER: UTD A GREAT STEP  Ajax goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen has been speaking about being linked with a move to Manchester United. He says he’s committed to Ajax but clearly is open to a move to Old Trafford, calling it a “great step”.  He told Sky Sports News HQ: “I only hear rumours. I don’t worry about it until I hear something from my agent – if I don’t hear anything I’ll enjoy playing at Ajax. I don’t know anything. I asked Memphis Depay if he had heard anything but he didn’t know anything either. It would be a great step but I am happy at Ajax.”"
reddevils,3dqgef,Feezbull,3,Sat Jul 18 13:30:08 2015 UTC,I'm surprised with Cillessen's english! Very good.

reddevils,3dqgef,Feezbull,9,Sat Jul 18 18:21:47 2015 UTC,No disrespect to the guy but he isn't good enough for us at all.
reddevils,3dqgef,AMAaboutA,11,Sat Jul 18 13:36:59 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised how good he is. He basically got Ajax 10-12 points on his own this year. At the Dutch national team he consistently plays well. But fuck it, people remember him not being good at stopping penalties so lets slate him."
reddevils,3dqgef,Muppetx,5,Sat Jul 18 13:51:47 2015 UTC,"David Marshall was one of the keepers of the year in the league in 13/14, it doesn't mean I think he'd be good enough to play for us. Whenever I've seen him he just doesn't strike me as someone we need, and he's not the quality we would need to replace De Gea."
reddevils,3dqgef,AMAaboutA,3,Sat Jul 18 14:18:37 2015 UTC,"While that's all good of course, I still think there are better keepers like Leno or Oblak to name 2 who are younger as well for that matter."
reddevils,3dqgef,Muppetx,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:40:00 2015 UTC,"Totally agree,although I do believe he might need some phasing in and adjusting to the epl, which would be relatively easy to do this year with de Gea looking to leave next year and valdes getting  sold. He's still relatively young also, so we canl easily get a decade out of him if we buy him. That said, I was thoroughly impressed by Johnstone earlier today and believe he'll be a better keeper than cillessen"
reddevils,3dqgef,GroteBergMan98,8,Sat Jul 18 14:11:29 2015 UTC,If you think Johnstone will be a better keeper after seeing him play 45 minutes it just shows how much you know about Cillessen.
reddevils,3dqgef,prehighcrap,2,Sat Jul 18 14:14:45 2015 UTC,"Let me rephrase : I've watched Cillessen every international game, and a few Eredivisie games since I'm from the Netherlands, so I'm honestly not an expert, however he always seemed a bit unconfident or stressed to me, I don't really know how to describe it , you probably know the expression I'm talking about.  Edit: This is the expression I'm talking about.   When I saw Johnstone playing this morning he just seemed a lot calmer and more decisive everytime I saw him going in. I also saw him take goal kicks with both feet today, and since he's only 22 I can see him surpassing Cillessen due to his confidence. Keep in mind that LvG made Cillessen the household name, before him it was mostly Stekelenburg after Van Der Sar retired."
reddevils,3dqgef,TheMathsDebater,2,Sat Jul 18 14:50:36 2015 UTC,Cillessen unconfident or stressed? If anything the guy doesn't seem to get nervous at any second and is always collected and confident. It's one of his biggest attributes. When you look at him from the outside you might think he seems vulnerable but he's quite the opposite.

Not because of the goal scored (although I guess that helps), but he showed exactly what we've been missing in midfield, someone who's not afraid to go for tackles, to challenge for the ball, he's an interception machine.

I still don't like his passing though. It's very one dimensional and the weight often kills the speed of an attack - the same as I saw at Southampton. If he could improve his passing he'll be one of our best signings of the premiership era.

reddevils,3dp1m9,Scarred_Shadow,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:14:45 2015 UTC,That's LVG's ideal formation
reddevils,3dp1m9,addodd,2,Sat Jul 18 02:34:49 2015 UTC,Yup. Let's hope Mata consolidates his place in the starting line-up for next season. :)
reddevils,3dp1m9,Scarred_Shadow,7,Sat Jul 18 02:43:05 2015 UTC,"Damn fascinating. Wouldn't have bet a quid that he'd experiment with the 4-2-3-1, but here we are.  Encouraging if true. Mata might have a home in Manchester after all.  EDIT: It's a 4-4-2 with Depay up-front. How did I ever underestimate Van Gaal? As if he'd play his players in their natural position."
reddevils,3dp1m9,Kambei1311,2,Sat Jul 18 02:44:08 2015 UTC,Somebody said LVG prefers his '4-3-3' with a CAM instead of dm+2cms. It makes sense considering we press into the opponents hard and the extra midfielder is good to link up the 2cms with the ST.
reddevils,3dp1m9,StannisJr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:35:40 2015 UTC,I was reading something earlier that said he basically played a 4231 exclusively at Bayern.
reddevils,3dp1m9,yiyiyiyi,2,Sat Jul 18 02:38:11 2015 UTC,"Still expect him to play a 4-3-3 next season. Can't imagine it'll be easy for him to stray from the system which gave him the most success last season.  A 4-2-3-1 requires the sacrifice of at least one central midfielder, and it's going to be difficult throwing aside one of Herrera, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, Fellaini, or Blind. In my mind, it makes a lot of sense for Schneiderlin to play the ""No. 4"" position that Rijkaard played at Ajax - that kind of intermediary between attack and defence - with Herrera as the mobile terrier-type and Schweinsteiger as the long-range artillery. Van Gaal has regularly bemoaned the lack of balance in the side, and I think our current emphasis on the midfield this summer would suggest a greater emphasis on oppressively keeping the ball in the opposition half rather than the lightning-quick counter-attacking game that Mourinho has mastered.  Then again, a 4-2-3-1 eases the striker dilemma. It either gives Mata a natural position to move to, or it allows Rooney to operate as a second striker, should we sign a goal-scorer of any note.  It's a funny compromise. I hope Van Gaal figures it out fast."
reddevils,3dp1m9,Kambei1311,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:43:25 2015 UTC,He won't play Rooney as a second striker. He's said he doesn't like his number 10 to be a striker. Herrera and Fellaini can both play as a number 10 though and Blind will get some games at LB. Carrick and Schweinsteiger can probably only play once a week at this point so their should be plenty of time for everyone in midfield if we do play 4-2-3-1 frequently.
reddevils,3dp1m9,Mezzala,6,Sat Jul 18 02:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's the same 4-3-3 from last season. Fellaini is replaced by Schneiderlin.  Edit: With the inclusion of Schneiderlin, Mata could easily play in Herrera's role. But, I agree with you guys. Looks more like a 4-2-3-1 or a 4-4-fucking-2"
reddevils,3dp1m9,pearlz176,8,Sat Jul 18 11:05:32 2015 UTC,Could easily be 4-4-2. Mata/Young on the wings and Memphis playing 2nd striker.
reddevils,3dp1m9,D1794,6,Sat Jul 18 02:14:33 2015 UTC,MUTV thinks so
reddevils,3dp1m9,Jaybains95,2,Sat Jul 18 02:16:56 2015 UTC,With Mata as the other midfielder?
reddevils,3dp1m9,Dry_Oasis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:35:27 2015 UTC,I don't see it. There are only 2 CMs in that line up. Unless Mata or Young is playing mid. Which would then not be same as last season.
reddevils,3dp1m9,ohhh_maaan,3,Sat Jul 18 02:15:39 2015 UTC,"Likely Mata as cam and then morgan/carrick holding, I don't see how 4-3-3 can work with those players."
reddevils,3dp1m9,StannisJr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:16:42 2015 UTC,Young played in the middle last game of the season.

reddevils,3dp1m9,schilom,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:20:30 2015 UTC,"Reading between the lines, and with two dominant CM signings, I'd expect two in front of the back 4 quite a bit this year. Also my view that these two years are the time you build your team around Rooney up top on his own. He can do it all, got to play to his strengths rather than shift him around to account for other deficiencies in the squad."
reddevils,3dp1m9,TheAgentInTheEast,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:15:15 2015 UTC,Why? Just the same 433 like last season.
reddevils,3dp1m9,Muppetx,11,Sat Jul 18 03:34:57 2015 UTC,"Money is on Carrick and Schneiderlin holding with Mata just ahead, then Memphis and Young flanking Rooney."
reddevils,3dp1m9,AJMcCoy612,2,Sat Jul 18 02:15:10 2015 UTC,Sounds really good. Relieves Mata of some defensive duties and lets him play in his best position.
reddevils,3dp1m9,omegaxLoL,4,Sat Jul 18 02:15:53 2015 UTC,"Blind at CB? Hmm. Was hoping to see Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger together but still glad 3/4 of our new signings are playing.

reddevils,3dp4e9,omegaxLoL,16,Sat Jul 18 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"No Fellaini or Goss is interesting. Excited to see Pereira, Januzaj and Wilson going forward though!"
reddevils,3dp4e9,Vetro777,23,Sat Jul 18 02:40:13 2015 UTC,And that german guy
reddevils,3dp4e9,number1journeyfan,5,Sat Jul 18 03:16:30 2015 UTC,Someone said he was pretty good. Something about a world trophy or some shit.
reddevils,3dp4e9,network_error,11,Sat Jul 18 03:25:24 2015 UTC,I heard he won the super bowl last year.
reddevils,3dp4e9,number1journeyfan,15,Sat Jul 18 03:57:19 2015 UTC,Scored a home run after he threw the puck into the hole.
reddevils,3dp4e9,Shaggadelic1,6,Sat Jul 18 04:10:18 2015 UTC,Mcnair and Blackett as fullbacks. Glad to see Lingard and it looks like LVG really does want to experiment with Januzaj at striker. Should be interesting.
reddevils,3dp4e9,ritwikjs,7,Sat Jul 18 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"blackett still worries me. McNair has got good runs in him. Janet Jazz Jam needs to get his shit together. Lingard was all over the place. Herrera was great at holding, Schweini was perfect as a B2B. THe biggest problem was that we weren't compact. WAY too spread out and not enough parallel running in the final third"
reddevils,3dp4e9,thecricketnerd,3,Sat Jul 18 07:31:10 2015 UTC,Herrera and Pereira! That'll be fun.
reddevils,3dp4e9,dudefise,10,Sat Jul 18 02:50:45 2015 UTC,"...so the youth squad with Hererra, Lindegaard and Schweini?"
reddevils,3dp4e9,simplyinnappropriate,10,Sat Jul 18 02:39:58 2015 UTC,Smalling+Evans as well.
reddevils,3dp4e9,StannisJr,5,Sat Jul 18 02:40:25 2015 UTC,"Didn't know Smalling, Lindegaard, Evans were youth also."
reddevils,3dp4e9,evilthing,3,Sat Jul 18 02:40:46 2015 UTC,Nice to see Bastian in there. His presence will be important since most of the players in this lineup are relatively young and inexperienced.
reddevils,3dp4e9,AlphaStryk3r,2,Sat Jul 18 02:41:39 2015 UTC,"Wonder who will be captain for the 2nd half, Schweinsteiger?"
reddevils,3dp4e9,AJMcCoy612,8,Sat Jul 18 02:40:16 2015 UTC,"Smalling in all likelihood, or Evans."
reddevils,3dp4e9,AlphaStryk3r,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:41:12 2015 UTC,"You're right, I don't know why their names went over my head in terms of captaincy."
reddevils,3dp4e9,AJMcCoy612,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:43:33 2015 UTC,"Schweinsteiger would be 4th for me though. Smalling, Evans, Herrera and then Bastian."
reddevils,3dp4e9,aman27deep,-6,Sat Jul 18 02:45:07 2015 UTC,Evans? lol.
reddevils,3dp4e9,AJMcCoy612,7,Sat Jul 18 02:47:15 2015 UTC,"Senior player in an influential position on the pitch, no brainier really."
reddevils,3dp4e9,StannisJr,3,Sat Jul 18 02:49:03 2015 UTC,Seems like another 4-2-3-1. No Fellaini or Goss though.
reddevils,3dp4e9,evolution909,2,Sat Jul 18 02:39:51 2015 UTC,442
reddevils,3dp4e9,StannisJr,-6,Sat Jul 18 02:41:43 2015 UTC,"LVG doesn't play 4-4-2.  Edit: Didn't see the pre-match interview, my bad."
reddevils,3dp4e9,evolution909,3,Sat Jul 18 02:42:07 2015 UTC,Did you hear the pre match interview?
reddevils,3dp4e9,StannisJr,3,Sat Jul 18 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"No, fair enough then."
reddevils,3dp4e9,evolution909,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:45:51 2015 UTC,Memphis and Rooney up front first half. 2nd Januzaj and Wilson.
reddevils,3dp4e9,JimmyDuckShoes,2,Sat Jul 18 02:44:56 2015 UTC,That couldn't be further from the truth
reddevils,3dp4e9,StannisJr,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:44:31 2015 UTC,How? His favored formation is 4-3-3.
reddevils,3dp4e9,omegaxLoL,2,Sat Jul 18 02:45:30 2015 UTC,Because he literally played 4-4-2 with us last season. He's more than flexible with formations.
reddevils,3dp4e9,LevynX,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:53:31 2015 UTC,You don't become a top manager by sticking to one style of play completely
reddevils,3dp4e9,StannisJr,0,Sat Jul 18 14:02:28 2015 UTC,"I remember he played that in the early part of the season, then during the latter part we went to a 4-3-3."
reddevils,3dp4e9,Hassi94,2,Sat Jul 18 02:55:48 2015 UTC,But you said he doesn't play 4-4-2
reddevils,3dp4e9,StannisJr,0,Sat Jul 18 03:00:09 2015 UTC,"He doesn't usually, early on in the season he kept changing because we weren't winning. His preferred formation is 4-3-3 and so I'm surprised we're not playing that, considering we'll likely be playing it the majority of the season."
reddevils,3dp4e9,ReaperX24,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:02:19 2015 UTC,"He is, though. He said Depay and Rooney are going to play as strikers. Same with Januzaj and Wilson."

reddevils,3dnk48,LordMoldevort,142,Fri Jul 17 18:48:41 2015 UTC,Fairly stupid that he needs to explain this. People get so sensitive about silly things.
reddevils,3dnk48,rezwah,68,Fri Jul 17 18:52:54 2015 UTC,"Yup, including us. Still remember the ""fuck Chicha"" brigade for calling Real the best/biggest club."
reddevils,3dnk48,HuzaifaElahi,19,Fri Jul 17 19:00:04 2015 UTC,"God that was so horrible. He said best, which they debatebly are, NOT biggest. It would be a spit on the face to say they're the biggest, but he didn't say that. Chicha is a model professional imo."
reddevils,3dnk48,linkolphd,27,Fri Jul 17 20:11:30 2015 UTC,It would be a spit on the face to say they're the biggest   I don't think it would have been.
reddevils,3dnk48,xtfftc,6,Fri Jul 17 20:42:49 2015 UTC,"Regardless of truth, you don't say things like that, because even if not explicitly saying it, people will interpret it as calling United ""small.""  We are just about on par with Madrid in reality for brand and fans, and we're the most successful English club, you could make a legitimate argument for us being the biggest club (not saying we are, just it could be argued). It is disrespectful for a player to not be on his true club's side for that.  Good thing Chicha didn't actually say ""biggest."""
reddevils,3dnk48,linkolphd,8,Fri Jul 17 21:21:42 2015 UTC,Yeah. Almost anywhere else it might be. But Real is probably the biggest club ever. I would say we are second :) but they top us.
reddevils,3dnk48,Kagawaful,19,Fri Jul 17 20:59:14 2015 UTC,"Saying RM are the biggest is as bad as saying United are the biggest. It all depends on your definition of 'biggest'. In terms of European titles? Of course it's RM. In terms of global fan base? All research done to date suggests it's United.  So which is the biggest? Both, in different ways."
reddevils,3dnk48,asparagus_p,3,Fri Jul 17 22:25:07 2015 UTC,"I think mixing everything together... Fan base, revenue, history. They are the biggest. We are second, and not far behind mind."
reddevils,3dnk48,Kagawaful,2,Fri Jul 17 23:09:04 2015 UTC,"I don't have current figures to hand but I think our revenues exceed theirs. 4 years ago, Forbes put us at the most valuable sports franchise in the world in any sport. We slipped down the list for a couple of years, but I think we're back on top after the latest Adidas deal.  Anyway, my point is that we need to stop this ranking rubbish. There's no 1st or 2nd, and even if there is, it changes from year to year anyway."
reddevils,3dnk48,asparagus_p,0,Fri Jul 17 23:33:18 2015 UTC,Real won the most valuable sports team this year
reddevils,3dnk48,0lberding,2,Sat Jul 18 03:09:37 2015 UTC,We just need 5 more champions leagues mate

reddevils,3dnk48,V_Bomber,9,Sat Jul 18 06:23:12 2015 UTC,"Oh my god. Not sure if any of you subscribe to the Bayern Munich USA FB group, I do (but only because I was trying to get a job at their NY office and thought that it could connect me with the right people). It is the WORST group ever. Like holy shit these people were OBSESSSED with Schweini and his United posts. Like I know facbook users are the lowest of the low but oh my god it was so annoying - they kept bitching about every single one of his FB/Instagram posts and saying like ""oh im going to return all of my schweini shit..blah blah"" like it was sacriligious that he moved from bayern to United. It was as if he had moved from Bayern to Dortmund or something..holy shit.."
reddevils,3dnk48,givehimthebird,5,Fri Jul 17 19:03:18 2015 UTC,Imagine if Giggs or Scholes had done something like that though. We'd have had a pretty similar crazy ex reaction as well...
reddevils,3dnk48,zethi,50,Fri Jul 17 22:34:17 2015 UTC,TBH I thought that was obvious from the original quote.  He literally says that United are more popular. He wouldn't badmouth  the club that made him.
reddevils,3dnk48,DelusionalThomas666,2,Fri Jul 17 18:53:02 2015 UTC,"For some reason so many ""fans"" think that just because a player leaves a club he completely broke with that club and cut all ties and then get overly sensitive about things like this. I'm a Bayern fan and have been all my life, that doesn't mean I can't accept that United has a far bigger reach, especially into English speaking countries like the USA. No idea why people get upset about things like this.  I personally hope he will do as great for you as he did for us. He deserves it."
reddevils,3dnk48,HyDchen,43,Sat Jul 18 08:15:35 2015 UTC,United is the most popular club in the English speaking world thanks to a lad named Alex Ferguson and some extremely marketable players who wore the number 7 shirt from 1998 - 2008
reddevils,3dnk48,yamchirobe,15,Fri Jul 17 19:31:03 2015 UTC,"Genuine question, wouldn't you include Cantona as marketable for a number 7? or is it because Beckham went to the next level with global appeal?"
reddevils,3dnk48,ashkjassal,30,Fri Jul 17 20:16:17 2015 UTC,"Cantona was a great player. But Beckham is probably the most popular footballer in the English Speaking World thanks to his good looks and pop star wife, no one comes close, he was so popular around 2000/2002 that there was a movie called Bend it like Beckham,which had nothing to do with him but cashed in on his popularity."
reddevils,3dnk48,yamchirobe,6,Fri Jul 17 20:22:32 2015 UTC,That always messed with me as a kid. I got it from Blockbuster to see a movie about Beckham and I think he appeared once...

reddevils,3dnk48,duckofwolfstreet,4,Fri Jul 17 23:38:42 2015 UTC,"It was a solid movie though, have rewatched it atleast 3 times over the years. Hot Indian girls, Beckham/United worship, hot Parminder Nagra, hot Keira Knightley, hot Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.  What's not to like."

It's not a slight on Bayern, it's just a statement of fact."
reddevils,3dnk48,dracovich,2,Fri Jul 17 21:21:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is what he means. United have a larger global fanbase. This in itself is not offensive, but as soon as the word 'biggest' is thrown about, there's a handful of clubs, including us, that get all up in arms."

We're by far the most popular team in by far the most popular league and it bears out with our sponsorship deals - which are figures that are most definitely not based on opinions.

He's the type of player Mourinho probably really likes because he's willing to retain possession, track back if you demand it, but be very clinical, direct and decisive on the counter attack. Only worth fighting for if Di Maria leaves imo."
reddevils,3do7nf,ReaperX24,13,Sat Jul 18 00:47:19 2015 UTC,"He can just as easily walk into ours. Hell, I'd argue that he is a better winger than any of our other players."
reddevils,3do7nf,BenDover97,2,Sat Jul 18 02:54:53 2015 UTC,I think Di Maria is miles better when he performs.
reddevils,3do7nf,ReaperX24,19,Sat Jul 18 03:50:31 2015 UTC,"when he performs.    That's the problem. Pedro is a far more consistent winger than Di Maria, who is so much better as a CM. Mata has been pretty good for a player that is not a natural winger, but Pedro is undoubtedly more suited to the position. He's definitely better than Young. That leaves Depay and Januzaj, who could grow to become better players than Pedro, but that has yet to be seen."
reddevils,3do7nf,Alexander_Pope,-30,Sat Jul 18 04:00:26 2015 UTC,I hope that isn't an opening bid because I don't want us spending 30m for a Barcelona back-up player.

MORE BROMANCE CANDIDATE!!  From Jamie Jackson's article:   The Dutchman wants to play 4-3-3 and Pedro’s versatility in being able to operate across the frontline is attractive.   There's a theme with LVG's signings. They tend to be versatile. I think Louis really rate players like this."

He is a massive part of the Argentinian team, in fact up until he got injured they looked immense and even with Messi in the copa America final his lack of presence was huge. I'd go as far as to say we need to stick Di Maria in the middle of the park and build our entire squad around him, he is literally that good when played in his best position.   I don't think he is anything special on the wing, but that doesn't mean he isn't a great player. Far and out the most talented player in the squad, with a potentially far higher ceiling than depay. If we lose him we are going to really really be hurting our chances in the champions leauge. He has that magic spark which creates space and chances for everyone else, maybe it's not as apparent in the PL- BUT against the big boys I really don't think mata, Rooney or even Herrera can match Di Marias ability to totally fuck up defensive lines."

Ask any RM fan and they will tell you AdM was immense at times but he was not consistently performing at a high level.   We cannot afford, nor is it tactically intelligent to give such an inconsistent player such an integral part of the team.   I hope he stays, I hope he plays and I hope he succeeds at United but there is no way I feel he should be the nucleus around which the team is built. His inability to hold down a regular starting spot last season is a pretty big sign."

Even with players playing in the same position- look at Veron when we bought him- talked about as the best in the world but couldn't keep up with the pace or the physicality of the prem. ADM is not a physical player, yes he's quick but he's uncomfortable under heavy challenges- compare his physique to a winger like Hazard or Ronaldo who have done well in the prem."
reddevils,3do7nf,TheMediumPanda,3,Sat Jul 18 08:38:38 2015 UTC,"It's mental, this guy is rivaled only by the likes of hazard, Silva, greizman, jese, James and ribery + robben with the ball and has the advantage that he is a beast of a tackler in comparison and never stops running. Oh yea and he  already pretty much won a CL final for his team and has almost achieved everything in football... Let's fucking sell him because he didn't set the world aflame after coming to a foreign country and getting injured of the back of the longest season any player could possibly of had in pretty much all professional football."
reddevils,3do7nf,WillyMorganOnTheWing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 08:33:55 2015 UTC,"Not for my part. I've never really liked him. He's a good player but his decision making has always been a bit off, and while he's better now, in the beginning at Real he did some horrendous dives and spent to much time yelling at the ref."
reddevils,3do7nf,omadanwar,0,Sat Jul 18 09:56:20 2015 UTC,"The ""his best position"" idea isn't correct for me. He played a very specific central role at Madrid that requires players like Ronaldo and Bale ahead of him with Alonso, Modric etc behind him. You are talking as if he has 10 years of playing centrally. He had a part of one season which was not his normal role."
reddevils,3do7nf,WillyMorganOnTheWing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:08:14 2015 UTC,Well he has actually had a few seasons of playing all around the pitch and what is clear is that he has much much more of an impact centrally than he does on the wing. Unfortunately at Madrid he never got the chance to partner modric consistently but whenever he did he was outstanding. I think it's safe to say that when a player excells every time he plays in a certain position relative to his performances in another position that we have found his favoured place on the field.
reddevils,3do7nf,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:16:05 2015 UTC,He made his name on the wing. Lets not pretend otherwise.

reddevils,3do7nf,DelTrotter,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:02:16 2015 UTC,"Totally agree that ADM doesn't fit but I don't think Pedro does either.  Pedro's a goalscorer, he's not a creator of chances.  If we're playing Memphis on one wing (a goalscorer) we want a creator on the other wing.  Totally agree that Di Maria isn't that player (too many risks, gives the ball away constantly etc..) but neither is Pedro.  We need a player in the Isco, Iniesta, Silva, Coutinho mould. An AM with the dribbling and speed to play wide and create chances but who also suits possession football. We did that last season with Mata but Mata just doesn't have the speed to go past players and make a consistent impact from wide.  Pedro isn't that kind of player, he's a possession football version of Memphis."
reddevils,3do7nf,SanJoseNativetil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:51:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a link between the two. Pedro plays on the right, Di Maria plays in the middle or left. At his best in the middle."

For the same money you could fill various different positions with longer-term options with greater upside. £22 million certainly wouldn't devastate us, but it's a mammoth opportunity cost. I hope this rumour stays a rumour."

reddevils,3do7nf,Feezbull,7,Fri Jul 17 23:37:33 2015 UTC,"If Di Maria goes, I'd back this 100% - he's a goalscoring threat and totally acclimatized to a possession based system while not losing creativity. He scored 15 for Barca when he was more of a starter in La Liga before last season and he hasn't declined (same as Angel I think?), he's just struggled to make a mark as mainly a substitute. For 22M, great buy."
reddevils,3do7nf,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:57:41 2015 UTC,"In terms of fit, he will be able to seamlessly sort into the team. But I don't know if he's that good though honestly now. I mean, I haven't watched him lately so I don't know how much he's regressed or tailed off.  And, sure he's better than Nani but that isn't too hard to achieve really.   Could you give a more detailed account of him? I know he used to score a fair bit as a winger for barca but again, not sure how he is now."
reddevils,3do7nf,superironthorman,9,Fri Jul 17 23:59:39 2015 UTC,"He's been used almost exclusively as a sub for Barca so naturally he's had a tough time at getting into rhythm and he isn't the Di Maria sort of player to make a quick mark with some extravagant attempted passes, solo runs and long shots.  I don't have stats on this but from watching, he's excellent at ball retention for a winger, one of the finest in the game in that regard and he'll rarely ever be at fault for causing a counter attack (conceding) compared to Di Maria who can cause several per match.    He's a solid finisher, especially for a winger. Got the lovely ball control and quick passing ability you'd expect from a Barca player. He's not lightening fast but it's his initial acceleration that causes issues. He's definitely Di Maria like in strength though.  He's Santi Cazorla level when it comes to being comfortable with both feet and naturally, can pay on either side. His defensive workrate is pretty unappreciated but he's nothing special tracking back at all.  He's good when it comes to creativity but not on his own, you pair him up with a player he can play 1-2s with and he'll get you the goods but he's not like Sanchez in bullying defenders and making solo runs through defense.  He relies on teammates stretching the defense with snappy passing or a striker getting man marked and occupying the attention of the defenders (Rooney can do that, obviously not like Messi does though).  He goes missing occasionally but he doesn't halt the forward line and instead just recycles possession leaving defense opening to his teammates while Di Maria can just lose the ball too frequently for anyone else to do something.  He's an intelligent player and this is key. Physically, he's not declined from what I can tell so I have hope that should we sign him, Van Gaal can get the best out him like Pep did around 2011 where Pedro was totally world class. Our 433 isn't far from what Pedro was playing in at Barca."

So he seems to me like more of a player who makes the system better and helps others along, while also having his own plus points in situations.  That said, I doubt we would leak we want him so I suspect this is to throw people off our real target instead, whomever it might be.   It just doesn't make sense to leak our interest at all."
reddevils,3do7nf,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:59:57 2015 UTC,"If Di Maria went, there would be another major signing to replace him (and not Pedro). Pedro would be a target anyway, assuming he is a target, what with Nani leaving. The squad is quite small for Champions League football."
reddevils,3do7nf,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"Who's going to actually create the chances though for Rooney, Memphis and Pedro to score?  Herrera, Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin is not a very creative midfield three."
reddevils,3do7nf,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:51:54 2015 UTC,Mata on the right?
reddevils,3do7nf,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:37:40 2015 UTC,"No Mata is very mediocre out there.  He's spent 18 months for United mostly playing out wide in some form or riding the bench and never come anything near his Chelsea form and it's easy to see why.  You can't play on the wing when you're the slowest player on the pitch unless you have absolutely incredible delivery on crosses (see Beckham), which Mata does not.   Play him on the wing and he does the occasional decent thing but he's nowhere near a top level player when put out there.   You can be that kind of player of play out wide if you have the acceleration to go past player (see Iniesta, Isco, Silva) but Mata just doesn't have it."
reddevils,3do7nf,illyria_ShrmpDmnsn,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:19:13 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more - but unless we use a rudimentary double pivot with Scheniderlin and Herrera/Schweinsteiger (something LvG isn't known for) to use Mata behind Rooney in basically a 4231, there's no way he fits in a 433. He doesn't offer enough in a midfield 3. What options do we have for the lack of creativity you see then? Personally, with Schweinsteiger who can hold his for a number 6 if used there and Schneiderlin who can be a tidy box to box and Herrera who's quite creative, I don't think we'll have that much of an issue creating chances and with direct wingers, it will help us more than Young lobbing crosses or Mata playing sideways passes like last season"
reddevils,3do7nf,mink_man,3,Sat Jul 18 01:31:38 2015 UTC,Really solid player. Not world class but he's quality.

reddevils,3do7nf,biasedkid,2,Sat Jul 18 09:20:48 2015 UTC,If we pull this off for 22m it's a great signing. Always in the shadow because of the greats in Barca but he is pretty underrated.

reddevils,3do7nf,jbiresq,2,Fri Jul 17 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"He was one of my three picks to get if DiMa leaves. Good goals record, good enough age to hang out for a few seasons and can play striker. If we can get him for 20 - 35m and we lose DiMa I'd say go for it"

Marca came out and said the buyout change only kicks in next year if he doesn't feature in a certain amount of minutes. Though they said if bids over a certain amount come in they will listen to it as per an agreement in a renewal discussion
reddevils,3do7nf,dannyaray89,-1,Fri Jul 17 23:25:39 2015 UTC,No thank you
reddevils,3do7nf,GarethGore,4,Fri Jul 17 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. Quality player, and I have plenty of respect for his ability. But I've just grown to hate him while at Barca.

reddevils,3do7nf,GarethGore,0,Sat Jul 18 00:29:38 2015 UTC,"Can we give him some games please? The fanboysism stems from his youth and potential. He has a lot missing from his game to be fair, but we also haven't seen enough of him to pass judgement either IMO"

If DiMa leaves a winger goes to the top of the list. If DDG stays may need to buy a CB and a back up keeper but the need is lessened"

reddevils,3do7nf,dannyaray89,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:30:28 2015 UTC,"Diving is an ugly influence in the beautiful game.   We forgive players who will in turn give it there all, get on with it, or make up for it with their abilities elsewhere. Like CR7 was an Olympic level diver but he also back it up with an amazing level of gameplay. Hazard goes down softly, but also takes a kicking. We don't hate him for his theatrics.   Young used to get schtick, but clearly his performances have shifted, no?"
reddevils,3do7nf,GarethGore,-4,Fri Jul 17 23:39:55 2015 UTC,"We're talking about a forward who is supposedly being targeted for his versatility, namely his ability to play across the front 3. Read the articles. They even go so far as to say his time has been restricted at Barca due to the arrival of Suarez, a pure striker lol  Edit: As for Januzaj and Young, their history of diving has definitely left a bad taste in my mouth, but they seem to have improved in that regard after being called out for it. Hopefully they've moved on from all that."

reddevils,3do7nf,dannyaray89,7,Sat Jul 18 00:44:52 2015 UTC,Well yes? It's pushed Messi out wide with Neymar on the other side? that limits Pedro's time obviously?
reddevils,3do7nf,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"I like how both of your responses consist purely of sarcastic remarks as if I were the dumbest person you've encountered today haha makes for a pleasant debate...  But to respond to your (rhetorical) questions anyway, just take a look at this quote from Pedro earlier this year on his versatility:  “I’ve never played as a full-back, although yes, I have done so with Del Bosque in practically all the training sessions [with Spain], but if the manager here decided to convert me to that role, then I’d be delighted. Anything that gets me games, I’ll go ahead with, but in principal it’s not my natural position. I’m a striker, which is where I perform more.”  Also, for WC 2014, Spain had 4 forwards listed in their lineup: Costa, Villa, Torres, and (you guessed it) Pedro.  By no means am I trying to say he is an out-and-out striker. I agree with you that he often is deployed at Barcelona as a winger in a front 3. But he is also more than capable of playing up top as a striker. And supposedly that type of versatility is what LVG likes in him (according to Jamie Jackson), especially given our shortage of strikers at the moment."
reddevils,3do7nf,dannyaray89,2,Fri Jul 17 22:47:46 2015 UTC,"By no means was I attempting to be condescending - my sincerest apologizes if I came across that way.  Yes, he has versatility but he's only coming in my mind if Di Maria goes to fill in on the right primarily, not backup ST although he can like Depay."
reddevils,3do7nf,MylesVE,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:18:02 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I'd much rather have di Maria, but he'd be a decent replacement should he actually go."
reddevils,3do7nf,Tob4,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:32:50 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're getting downvoted. We don't need Pedro. If we sell di Maria then I hope we would go after someone more of the Reus, Greizman, Lacazette variety.   Pedro doesn't tick any boxes we need right now (as in currently, today, now, jetzt) and this is probably just agent foder to see if Chelsea will act faster or other clubs will bid for a guy desperate for playing time."

reddevils,3do7nf,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:50:06 2015 UTC,seems better for us than di maría in that case tbh
reddevils,3do7nf,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:43:15 2015 UTC,He isn't good at creating chances at all.  He's a brilliant goal threat and he does keep the ball well but he is not a creative player at all.
reddevils,3do7nf,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:11:37 2015 UTC,It's not his strength but I wouldn't dare say it's a weakness. He doesn't REALLY create chances himself in a way but it's his link up play to keep the ball flowing freely enough to create a gap in defense that leads to chances.
reddevils,3do7nf,HuzaifaElahi,2,Fri Jul 17 21:54:14 2015 UTC,"That isn't good enough.  That's fine when you have Iniesta and Messi on the pitch to create endless chances high up the field.  We don't have either that level of player or that type of player. It's that type of player that we need our Di Maria replacement to be, not a player like Pedro.  You need a balance in your front 5 (two CM's, two Wingers, one striker) of players who are going create loads of chances and players who can score.  Herrera and Schneiderlin don't create many chances. Neither of them were even in the top 100 players in the PL last season in terms of chances created.  Depay isn't a prolific chance creator, neither is Pedro and neither is Rooney.  We have two many goal scorers and not enough to players to actually create those goals and it was the same last season too, which is why we scored so few."
reddevils,3do7nf,JuanRiquelme,2,Fri Jul 17 22:07:15 2015 UTC,Then who's your suggestion for a replacement?
reddevils,3do7nf,King-Eric,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:32:36 2015 UTC,No. He's a goal scorer.

I think Pedro is fine as an option either from the bench or to rotate with Memphis (no guarentee he'll settle/do well).   who else is available?   I hate speculating on that.

reddevils,3do7nf,trustfundbaby,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:29:42 2015 UTC,I posted about this in the transfer thread last week.   I don't mind this signing at all. I'd love it if Angel stayed and did his best but if he wants to leave then we shouldn't keep him on the bench.   Pedro is being kept out of that squad by Neymar which says something. He played amazing under Pep and he's got tons of experience. Young and relatively cheap and can play a role while Depay gets acclimated.
reddevils,3do7nf,johnsom3,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:59:00 2015 UTC,"I didn't get this at first but the more I think about it the more it makes sense.  If you buy a marquee out-and-out striker then it means Rooney has to play deeper as a support striker, where I think you get less out of him. It'd probably cost you a lot of money,  and that would mean Mata and Herrera (possibly) don't get utilized as much ... with Pedro playing as a support striker it means you have Rooney and Chicha as out and out strikers with Pedro then Mata ... (Herrera again) as #10s ... its not conventional, but it works. Isn't too expensive and you get the added versatility of Pedro being able to convert to a proper winger if need be with Mata/Herrera stepping into that support striker role if needed.  Interesting to see how this plays out"
reddevils,3do7nf,I_WILL_NEVER_RUST,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:21:33 2015 UTC,I would be all for this if we sell Di Maria. Pedro is no star but he would work well with our system and he's a versatile player.

reddevils,3do7nf,princessvaginaalpha,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:55:32 2015 UTC,"Personally i think it's bs, but i'll give my opinion on it anyway. First he gets linked to Chelsea, yesterday Liverpool, today us. Sounds like he's being flaunted rather than serious interest from our sides.  We don't have a natural right sided forward. Di Maria has been questionable over there, Valencia is now a RB. Young can fill in, Memphis we haven't seen there yet and his main role is LW. Mata's grown into it but it's still not his best role and he acts more like a creative/central midfielder drifting inside. Januzaj, a mix of Di Maria and Young. Perreira the one time i saw him there played like a carbon copy of Mata, it's not natural to him.  While it's not as pressing a concern as CB or striker, Pedro would be a fine addition who's proven in that position. Two footed, quick, intelligent, always moving, harassing, goes inside or out, stretches defenders, guaranteed goals. The amount of goalscoring players we would have outside the striker position would be outstanding. So much fire power and less reliance on any individuals. Even if he doesn't come, Depay, Di Maria, Mata, Herrera etc i haven't seen us have so many potential non striking goalscorers since we had Giggs, Beckham and Scholes there back in the day giving us ~10 each every year. (Ronaldo doesn't count)"

reddevils,3dpjpp,nandoschickenwings1,10,Sat Jul 18 05:31:05 2015 UTC,Ogden spoke of both Memphis and Januzaj as if the season was already up and running and that they had both blown numerous chances to impress. It was 45 minutes of the first damn preseason game.

reddevils,3dpjpp,ThatStiffyAce,2,Sat Jul 18 05:36:00 2015 UTC,Definitely. The over the top and through balls he did where fantastic. Mata could have scored/assisted one one if he took it down better.

reddevils,3dpjpp,CosmicGravy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:21:32 2015 UTC,"He had some good moments, but others he held on to the ball to long or chose the wrong option. I see what Ogden is talking about. First 45 min of preseason so I'm not worried too much."
reddevils,3dpjpp,soundthealarm21,2,Sat Jul 18 19:24:41 2015 UTC,"At  certain points he seemed more eager to receive the ball than run into the box and take up a position.

reddevils,3dpjpp,harps86,2,Sat Jul 18 06:12:03 2015 UTC,I think it all stems from the fact that at the beginning of last season he was really selfish and squandered a lot of chances and people are just not willing to see past it even though he worked on that and became a lot less selfish. idk thats just what I feel.

""United need to buy another striker ""  Hit the nail right on the head there. Rooney alone won't do it. His touch wasn't the best despite all the space but I liked that he's got an understanding with Memphis. Still early days in that do won't nitpick.   Wilson as we saw is still in development and fresh. Needs to learn to slow down at times. His body and brain are going 200 km/h so the passes are coming in too hot."
reddevils,3dpjpp,KlausJanVanWolfhaus,3,Sat Jul 18 05:29:07 2015 UTC,"Wilson is a type of player that likes to run onto through balls and have a shot at goal, just like Falcao, but we play in a system where the CF has very few touches but has to bring others into play and also has to occupy the space behind the centre-backs from time to time, Rooney is the only one that can do it for us. Wilson is young and will take a lot of time to develop that way, he is good to bring on in the second half. Chicha, I don't think he can play that role but he's a good option to have, we need a CF who can fill Rooney's void when is either injured/suspended/knackered."
reddevils,3dpjpp,as520,2,Sat Jul 18 07:59:48 2015 UTC,Agreed. One who could also run whilst being able to hold the ball when needed would be perfect.   Let's hope this surprise that LvG has planned for us isn't a dodgy one like buying Charlie Adam.

Hypothetically, would you have Inzaghi (the poacher all poachers should call god) in the dominant barca team ? Doesn't make a lot of sense does it. The team operates within the framework that everyone should be able to pass the ball and create space a certain way. Chica from what I've seen doesn't fit in."
reddevils,3dpjpp,RedDevil237025,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"The whole point is that people are complaining about no dominant goal scorer in the united squad; Falcao and RVP didn't really preform, Chicha was loaned out for whatever reason, and Rooney was stuck in midfield half the time he actually played. Messi and Neymar are both dominant goalscorers, you cannot compare the two sides. If Messi and Neymar both for some reason dipped like Falcao and RVP did; the top priority would be getting someone to bang them in.

He scored 15 for Barca when he was more of a starter in La Liga before last season and he hasn't declined (same *age as Angel I think?), he's just struggled to make a mark as mainly a substitute. For 22M, great buy.  EDIT: *Spelling"
reddevils,3do8gs,HuzaifaElahi,24,Fri Jul 17 22:01:07 2015 UTC,"And he is a sub because his competition for places consists of the best attack line in the world. I think he is an excellent player, and if United can get him I'd be very happy."
reddevils,3do8gs,blorimer542,12,Fri Jul 17 22:05:21 2015 UTC,I think this means that Di Maria is out.
reddevils,3do8gs,Bradddtheimpaler,2,Fri Jul 17 22:33:08 2015 UTC,I'd say there's very little doubt about that anyway given the profusion of stories from France and LVG's reaction when asked.

This isnt one of them though, a brief is a private thing done to a few journalists, all of them say the same thing and they usually serve a purpose (advertise a player is leaving like the Evans thing, advertise how much money we have in leftovers like the bale thing). This isnt that, it was a advertised meeting he was having with the press (Mutv live tour show earlier said Ed was having an interview with the press and would also be speaking to them), hence why unreliable places are running it and hence why the articles have slightly different takes (Ogden saying its because he wants to join Mata ect)"
reddevils,3do8gs,Creamy_Goodne55,45,Fri Jul 17 22:27:19 2015 UTC,This would be a brilliant move. Pedro fits our style of play much much better than Di Maria. That's the blatant truth.

reddevils,3do8gs,ohyou123,49,Fri Jul 17 22:18:36 2015 UTC,He's spent his whole career playing in a possession based team in Barcelona

reddevils,3do8gs,King_Eric,20,Fri Jul 17 22:29:55 2015 UTC,"Didnt mean to sound arsey haha thats just the answer put bluntly, to elaborate Di Maria is a better player IMO, but thrives more in a counter attacking system a la Fergies United. For LVG's possession style, I think he is too careless sometimes, where Pedro is tailor made to play this style of play."
reddevils,3do8gs,clg93,3,Fri Jul 17 22:37:30 2015 UTC,"I'll agree about ADM: Spectacular player, but he doesn't really fit LVG's approach."
reddevils,3do8gs,King_Eric,14,Fri Jul 17 23:13:56 2015 UTC,Played 50+ games a year every year for the best Barcelona team in history. Can play anywhere along the front 3. This is a much better signing than Benteke to put it lightly. Will be very happy if this comes off.
reddevils,3do8gs,G_Morgan,10,Fri Jul 17 22:36:26 2015 UTC,I mean I know we're rivals but they don't even play in the same bloody position so it's a silly comparison.
reddevils,3do8gs,TheJoshider10,3,Fri Jul 17 22:41:12 2015 UTC,He can play forward. He is just a forward that actually suits our system. I suspected that this is what LVG would look at. Somebody who could play wide and centrally rather than trying to get a bench striker.  I mention Benteke because we were linked to him.
reddevils,3do8gs,G_Morgan,2,Fri Jul 17 22:52:30 2015 UTC,Played 50+ games a year every year for the best Barcelona team in history.   For all he's clearly a good player that's not true. Plus even the seasons where he's played 50 games a lot of them have been sub appearances. I'd be happy with the signing but let's stick to the facts.
reddevils,3do8gs,fredum,3,Fri Jul 17 23:30:07 2015 UTC,Actually the stats /u/G_Morgan is stating are true in spirit (He played 48 and 45 games in two seasons and 50+ in 4 seasons). I was also surprised.
reddevils,3do8gs,devil27,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah I checked the numbers before posting, 45 isn't 50 though so 2/6 seasons he didn't. Also the reason they sound higher than you might imagine is because he doesn't start anywhere near that many - only 15 in the league last year and never more than 28 in his career, which was the year they didn't win a trophy. The full stats are here if you want to see"
reddevils,3do8gs,fredum,3,Sat Jul 18 06:01:08 2015 UTC,"I think he is one of the most underrated players in the world. He is one of the Barca studs who get overlooked because of Messi, Neymar, and Suarez... like Sanchez last year. He has less flare than sanchez but plays his role and isn't ever outmatched in any game due to lack of talent. He can play on almost any top tier team."
reddevils,3do8gs,ajdoj14,2,Fri Jul 17 23:19:40 2015 UTC,"Good at retaining possession and playing the short-passing game.  Not as creative as Di Maria but a bigger goal threat, more willing to run in behind, two-footed and more suited to our style of play.  I'd be sad if we sold Di Maria but I think Pedro would be a good replacement."
reddevils,3do8gs,RFerrer-,9,Sat Jul 18 00:48:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like Di Maria's effectiveness at the tip of a midfield three is potentially going to improve if two of carrick/schweinsteiger/ schneiderlin play behind him, given that he'll have more license to roam. I'd hate to not see this given a chance"
reddevils,3do8gs,PNE95,3,Fri Jul 17 23:06:56 2015 UTC,Our midfield triangle points backwards not forwards. It's clear that LVG won't use Di Maria in midfield at this point - not his kind of midfielder.
reddevils,3do8gs,RFerrer-,4,Sat Jul 18 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"I should clarify, I mean the same position as he played at Real Madrid, the more advanced of two central midfielders ahead of a holding defensive mid.  And I don't think we ever had the option of playing him in that position due to Rooney/herrera's propensity to attack as well. I think with our new signings, di Maria may be an option there now."
reddevils,3do8gs,PNE95,2,Sat Jul 18 01:48:54 2015 UTC,Van Gaal had the opportunity to play him there towards the end of the season but opted for Young. Doesn't bode well.
reddevils,3do8gs,RFerrer-,2,Sat Jul 18 01:56:44 2015 UTC,"Young played left wing, di Maria would play where fellaini was playing if schneiderlin for example took herrera's position.   I personally think that Herrera will have a huge season next year and play di Maria out of the team, but I'm just saying that we have the option of playing di Maria in his best position now that we have some bite in midfield."
reddevils,3do8gs,PNE95,2,Sat Jul 18 02:19:50 2015 UTC,"Young played left wing,   There was a match where Young played in midfield towards the end of the season and Di Maria played LW. Can't remember which match though."

reddevils,3do8gs,7evenStrings,8,Fri Jul 17 22:10:40 2015 UTC,Could be an interesting right winger for us I reckon.
reddevils,3do8gs,omegaxLoL,5,Fri Jul 17 22:13:58 2015 UTC,Never even thought of Pedro as a potential target. Loving the way we're doing business. Can't wait for GNev to do a squad depth comparison between start of last season and this season.
reddevils,3do8gs,mink_man,5,Fri Jul 17 22:25:54 2015 UTC,"You don't score 100 goals for Barcelona if you're not a good player.  Obviously I'd rather have Reus, Muller, De Bruyne, Bale etc, but Pedro would suit our system a lot and is proven under Guardiola's possession based system."
reddevils,3do8gs,SonnyisKing,7,Fri Jul 17 22:59:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly the way I see this, it's an upgrade to Nani. I fucking hope Di Maria isn't leaving because of this."
reddevils,3do8gs,TheJoshider10,9,Fri Jul 17 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"I think this is a case of Pedro coming in because Di Maria looks set to leave. Either way, Di Maria gets to play for his favored club in a league he is more likely to excel in and we get a proper goal scoring winger in who doesn't spend most his time out injured. Di Maria is wasted on the wing."

reddevils,3do8gs,Herramadur,5,Fri Jul 17 22:00:30 2015 UTC,I think he played 50 times last year but many were sub appearances. If I recall correctly he has something like 100 goals in 300 games for Barcalona which is very respectable for a winger especially considering he has made many sub appearances. He'd get into any team in England no doubt.

reddevils,3do8gs,OGlogza,7,Fri Jul 17 22:10:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah but his old contract had a release clause of something stupid like £100m (cant remember exactly), his new contract has a release clause of £22m."

reddevils,3do8gs,TMillo,5,Fri Jul 17 23:18:00 2015 UTC,"Agree completely with all of that, but Di Maria looks like he doesn't want to be here, so I guess we have to settle for him. Wish we could have kept ADM though, an explosive player that could produce a moment of magic if needed."
reddevils,3do8gs,TheMathsDebater,5,Fri Jul 17 22:29:34 2015 UTC,Most of the negative Di Maria reports are coming from the same places that said he would sign Clyne etc. it seems everyone is clambering for stories and the player himself has said the absolute opposite.   Although it was shown today with Citeh and Delph that words from players can occasionally mean nothing
reddevils,3do8gs,TMillo,2,Fri Jul 17 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"He helped win barca a champions league against us...  Pedro is a much better player at right wing for Van gaal's system, absolutely lethal finisher and great in possession. Underrated due to him playing his best years next to messi and villa  I admit that di Maria is probably second to none at the tip of a 3 person midfield in a counter attacking system. But that's the thing, he hasn't proved very effective in our possession based game, and we shouldn't alter our style of football to suit him. It makes sense to replace him with a player that's more suited to the way we play.  My opinion however is that we should keep di Maria since he deserves another chance to prove himself. But Pedro certainly is a top class player.  Edit: typos"
reddevils,3do8gs,PNE95,0,Fri Jul 17 22:57:56 2015 UTC,"Lol so many people off the Di Maria bandwagon at the mention of Pedro, what is wrong with y'all?

""We still need to improve at least two positions and we shall when possible."" [@ManUtd]    Pedro:   Van Gaal is ready to trigger Pedro’s £22m (€31.7m) release clause and bring him to Old Trafford. Manchester United is Pedro’s preferred destination, although Liverpool and Chelsea are also interested in him. He is keen to join fellow Spaniards Juan mata, Ander Herrera, and De Gea at Old Trafford. [Mark Ogden, Jamie Jackson]     Goalkeeper merry-go-round:    Manchester United are prepared to lose out on a transfer fee for De Gea and let him leave for free next summer rather than give in to Real Madrid’s demands. United see Real as acting “like bullies” and are prepared to fight Real madrid for the best players. [BBC, SSN, Jamie Jackson, Mark Ogden, James Ducker] Jasper Cillessen will replace De Gea if he does move to Real Madrid this summer. [The Times]  Victor Valdes will leave Manchester United. His most likely destination is the MLS. Sergio Romero will join United to replace Valdes as backup goalkeeper. [Di Marzio]  Victor Valdes is reluctant to return to Spain given his affinity for Barcelona. He will definitely leave Manchester United though. [Paul Hirst]  Sergio Romero will go to Seattle soon to undergo his Manchester United medical. [Sky Italia via Omid Zamani]      Sergio Ramos:   Rafael Benítez: “Sergio is training fantastically, I was told he was a great professional but it has been a great pleasure to see how much he puts in and works day in, day out. I think the president has said, I don't know whether publicly or not but I've read it a few times, that he will stay and will be here. If that is the case, I will be the happiest man in the world because he is a great professional, a great player and with the dedication and motivation that I've seen, he can be a great captain. I spoke to him over the summer and when we trained in Madrid about his future, his ideas and ours and are no longer talking about him. What I want is for him to train well and he is. The future, I see it with Sergio because he is an essential player due to his qualities on the pitch as well as his mentality and leadership off it”.     Nicolas Otamendi:   Otamendi is willing to reduce his wages in order to force though a move to Manchester United from Valencia. [Plaza Deportiva]  Van Gaal is not interested in Otamendi, and Manchester United will not make a move for him. [James Ducker]     John Stones:   Chelsea’s interest in the young defender has put Manchester United and City on alert."
reddevils,3doh4w,EaglesonTV,35,Fri Jul 17 23:13:14 2015 UTC,Pedro is exactly the type of versatile striker LVG would want and he knows possession football better than anybody else on the market.
reddevils,3doh4w,mahan95,10,Fri Jul 17 23:24:40 2015 UTC,I don't know much about the player but from a communications point of view I don't know why you would put out a storey saying that we are about to pay his buy out clause.  What is the point in alerting other teams?
reddevils,3doh4w,idratherwalkalone,8,Fri Jul 17 23:29:26 2015 UTC,I don't know anything about him either. But maybe it's time for Van Gaal Mind games?

reddevils,3doh4w,Nestledrink,-1,Sat Jul 18 00:39:31 2015 UTC,We absolutely have to get to Stones before anyone else does. Young promising (and good) English defenders don't come by very often. Although we would more than likely have to loan him back to Everton.

reddevils,3doh4w,arron77,21,Fri Jul 17 23:51:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah we only spent like £75m so far, which is a bargain considering the quality of players and how we needed these positions filled. Much better business than last year where I feel we'd have paid closer to £100m for this bunch.   If we pull in Pedro and a CB for say £50m together but sell Di Maria for around that price I'd say buying 6 players that all massively improve the squad for a total of £75m is fucking wonderful business."

reddevils,3doh4w,mentalcaseinspace,2,Sat Jul 18 14:19:42 2015 UTC,Too difficult to tell dude. A lot of De Gea's progress has been put down to the previous two coaches. But we can't tell as there is no way to judge unless you've worked with them.
reddevils,3doh4w,BigCheeser,2,Sat Jul 18 15:48:57 2015 UTC,He was vital for van der Sar and also making a pretty average keeper that Valdes is have a great career. I think it goes without saying. For De Gea I think it's mostly positioning and playing like the back man instead of a keeper with team mates that he's gotten time to make a big impact on.
reddevils,3doh4w,mentalcaseinspace,2,Sat Jul 18 17:24:00 2015 UTC,"The transformation that De Gea had under those two coaches was almost night and day, while he had talent to work under they still deserved credit. Valdes was not an average keeper by any means, he'll not be legendary like Buffon but he was still playing well long after Hoek was gone and the last two years he had for Barca he was unreal."
reddevils,3doh4w,BigCheeser,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:30:57 2015 UTC,"De Gea is such a big talent that he needed the right guidance, nothing else, both Valdes and van der Sar had less ""specialties"".   I knew from the day we bought De Gea that he would be a top 3 world keeper so for me there was never any doubt, but I dunno where I have this keeper eye and interest from, I was always a striker.   I would say Woods definitely added to the physicality in his game, Hoek has been working on him being confident in his place both with feet and hands so I think he's more like a player now than he was. But overall I thought he didn't have any major leaps in his first years that weren't down to just experience and gaining confidence. Nothing special in his game that I think his coach did. But they of course have good relationships with their keeper coaches and he was great too. But for me Hoek has always been special. van der Sar was my favourite keeper since mid 90s and had we gotten him sooner we'd have more trophys for sure."

It looks to be a case where he may not be a better player than what we have on paper (Di Maria), but he will fit the system better and that is what matters.   I hope it doesn't mean Di Maria goes but at the same time it's comforting to know we should be having a player who fits into the system better than Di Maria would and we'd get a nice sum of money for him too."

Digby: There is no way in hell he can play for Man Utd's reserves never mind with us! CM who is like 6ft 4 but has no strength or heading ability, slow as the Titanic on a turn and as fast a slug.

reddevils,3doh4w,Aenemas,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:47 2015 UTC,"After watching last nights game I now understand the importance of the Schifield. Morgan and Bastian are going to help us tremendously. They are physical, balanced, and make decisive plays that help retain possession. I think we will lose Di Maria to PSG and I'm ok with it especially if Pedro comes in. I believe Di Maria does not fit with our possession style of play because he prefers to run at the opposition which allows the ball to be lost easily. Truthfully I believe Pedro will slot in better and allow for LVG to maintain his philosophy. Coupled with a new striker and new CB I think we will be a very dangerous side that can dominate the pitch. Di Maria is a world class talent but if the glove does not fit one must acquit."

reddevils,3dorwa,TweetPoster,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:10:35 2015 UTC,I really enjoy listening to him. He's got that positive aura about him for some reason.
reddevils,3dpbue,SpeedyOwnt,25,Sat Jul 18 03:52:00 2015 UTC,Johnstone has been brilliant so far. Schneiderlin has a really good passing range. Memphis always seems to have a bag of tricks up his sleeves. Darmian is sound both offensively and defensively. Overall it's been a good half.
reddevils,3dpbue,ballsywallsy,49,Sat Jul 18 03:53:50 2015 UTC,The Treble is on.
reddevils,3dpbue,ColdandTense,0,Sat Jul 18 03:53:22 2015 UTC,"I sang this aloud ala ""the heat is on"". I'm not ashamed"
reddevils,3dpbue,MylesVE,25,Sat Jul 18 03:55:40 2015 UTC,"Schneiderlin has been a revelation. Time and time again he just takes the ball of people and pings a great pass to an attacking player. Darmian also very solid. Memphis is looking very very promising, if a tad wasteful at times (but that's just the sort of player he is right now)"
reddevils,3dpbue,asteroid_puncher,5,Sat Jul 18 03:55:01 2015 UTC,I wish there was an opportunity to see Memphis take a free kick :(
reddevils,3dpbue,aman27deep,2,Sat Jul 18 04:06:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely. His athleticism lets him be everywhere, which is refreshing. He's a mobile midfielder with defensive attributes and physique to go with that; all in all a rather rare combination. I think he can be the difference for us this season. I expect him to be playing 90% of our games."
reddevils,3dpbue,rdzzl,19,Sat Jul 18 07:31:15 2015 UTC,Morgan's passing range was very impressive along with his defensive work.
reddevils,3dpbue,philliesphan0203,32,Sat Jul 18 03:53:33 2015 UTC,"Memphis looks really good, wrong decision on that pass for Young, but other than that, he's really exciting to watch"
reddevils,3dpbue,efribble,19,Sat Jul 18 03:52:45 2015 UTC,You're gonna get more moments of that next season. He still has the decision making of a young player which can sometimes be frustrating.
reddevils,3dpbue,Muppetx,3,Sat Jul 18 03:55:34 2015 UTC,Something which is part of the development process. There were plenty of other times that he passed intelligently so I wouldn't say it's a concern at all. Especially considering he's 21 and this is his first game for the club.
reddevils,3dpbue,Baskale,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:05:56 2015 UTC,1st time chip pass to Rooney was magic. Strictly magic in the making is all we are seeing boys!
reddevils,3dpbue,MylesVE,34,Sat Jul 18 04:11:28 2015 UTC,I thought Darmian was our best player. Is this what it's like to have a proper right back?
reddevils,3dpbue,backthatpassup,12,Sat Jul 18 03:52:59 2015 UTC,"I'm far more impressed by his ability to play with either foot, looks natural to him playing with his left."
reddevils,3dpbue,peduxe,7,Sat Jul 18 03:58:01 2015 UTC,Unsurprising as he can play RB and LB equally well.

reddevils,3dpbue,Jhix,29,Sat Jul 18 04:05:50 2015 UTC,"I was also impressed by Darmian, Depay and Johnstone"
reddevils,3dpbue,Erique,15,Sat Jul 18 03:52:40 2015 UTC,"Johnstone was great except for his long kicks, which were fucking dreadful."
reddevils,3dpbue,reddishangel,10,Sat Jul 18 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"He's been on point with his tackling, interception and passes. Very impressed with him."
reddevils,3dpbue,MegaxJak1,8,Sat Jul 18 03:53:03 2015 UTC,Darmian was pretty outstanding. Good debut! And Schneiderlin too!
reddevils,3dpbue,firdausazmi,7,Sat Jul 18 03:54:49 2015 UTC,"Won't grab any headlines, but I am liking the look of Darmian so far. Quick, determined, good going forward. And as long as they don't injure anyone, I think these guys have been perfect pre-season opponents, plenty of effort and running."
reddevils,3dpbue,Pedantic_Pat,6,Sat Jul 18 03:52:42 2015 UTC,"I was impressed by his defensive work. He understood his position very well and had a real dominance on the right side of the pitch that I'm just not used to.  That said, he left Mata isolated at least twice going forward, forcing us to play it backwards when we had numbers forward. Shaw, and most fullbacks we play, are quick to overlap and support our forwards. It seemed strange to see him standing static when Mata was expecting the option to appear.   I'm sure this will come with time. His main job is as a defender and he is impressive there."
reddevils,3dpbue,lestat85,7,Sat Jul 18 03:57:25 2015 UTC,Darmian is really impressive!! Amazing quality!
reddevils,3dpbue,mkenya4t,13,Sat Jul 18 03:52:56 2015 UTC,I was really impressed by Memphis's hold up play   Also really loved Darmian defensively minus that 1 mistake
reddevils,3dpbue,daprodigyx19,12,Sat Jul 18 03:52:45 2015 UTC,Morgan looks like the real deal in midfield and I squeal like a little girl every time I see Memphis on the ball. AND in T-Minus 10 minutes I get to watch Bastian FUCKING Schweinsteiger play for Manchester United!
reddevils,3dpbue,MySeaTurtleGreg,6,Sat Jul 18 03:54:15 2015 UTC,"You can tell club America are in the middle of their season, so much sharper and quicker to everything."
reddevils,3dpbue,OPisOkay,4,Sat Jul 18 03:55:42 2015 UTC,Quick pressing. But being offside looks like a Mexican disease to me (referencing to chicharito).
reddevils,3dpbue,aman27deep,5,Sat Jul 18 04:09:21 2015 UTC,"This half really highlights the importance of Fellaini in our team. Every time Johnstone received the ball, he was heavily pressurized by Club American players thus forced to kick the ball up the field to Memphis/Rooney and Club America gained possession."
reddevils,3dpbue,mark822,8,Sat Jul 18 04:00:55 2015 UTC,"Our new signings looked good, Blind is terrible as a CB, the officials are incredibly bad, as is the pitch.   Still, Schweinsteiger next :D"
reddevils,3dpbue,sup_bruv,3,Sat Jul 18 03:54:54 2015 UTC,Terrible? I think he reads the game really well and apart from the sliding in the box played decently.
reddevils,3dpbue,Muppetx,3,Sat Jul 18 04:07:31 2015 UTC,"I personally thought he just looked really uncomfortable there. Just got himself in some bad positions, like the penalty shout for example."
reddevils,3dpbue,sup_bruv,3,Sat Jul 18 04:12:51 2015 UTC,"I think that was the only time he got himself in a bad position, he intercepted quite a few balls."
reddevils,3dpbue,Muppetx,4,Sat Jul 18 04:54:18 2015 UTC,"Gotta say I agree with you on this /u/Muppetx. Worth mentioning that Blind had to cover his own space as well as Jones' space on at least two occations, which makes it even harder to fill in at CB for him. All in all a decent performance from Daley."
reddevils,3dpbue,rdzzl,2,Sat Jul 18 07:35:49 2015 UTC,Exactly. I think people are overly critical on Blind these days on this sub because he plays in a position where he isn't the star and we've made star signings. So obviously people want to see the stars and are overly critical on Blind to convince themselves the stars are way better.
reddevils,3dpbue,Muppetx,3,Sat Jul 18 13:40:44 2015 UTC,"Darmian has some amazing vision and pass on him. Johnstone was a beast being a sweeper and Schneiderlin is an engine! Blind is doing some good overlapping play, as a cb at that. Memphis is damn strong but I think he's be better more wide."
reddevils,3dpbue,MadaraTheUchiha,3,Sat Jul 18 03:55:25 2015 UTC,"Schneiderlin was my top player of the first half.  Scored the goal, made some excellent challenges.  I think he's going to be a big part of our success this year.    Memphis was quiet for the first 25 minutes or so but showed some great pace and very intelligent passes.  I'm looking forward to his link up play with Rooney.    Darmian.  Oh Darmian! A proper right back.  Got caught out a few times but looked great for the most part.  I am super excited about having this guy.    Ashley Young showed that he still has a part to play here.  He looks great on the left wing.  He's really made that position his own in the last year.    Johnstone looked good too.  Didn't have much to do but he was able to come out a few times and able to play the ball with his feet as well."
reddevils,3dpbue,Nostrabrahmus,3,Sat Jul 18 03:56:19 2015 UTC,Imagine if Valencia made that mistake?
reddevils,3dpbue,McGrifty,2,Sat Jul 18 03:56:53 2015 UTC,"Sadly true, one big mistake in the Arsenal game and most people crucified him, really unfair"
reddevils,3dpbue,YoungJump,3,Sat Jul 18 04:04:29 2015 UTC,"Memphis was extremely lazy off the ball, but whatever times was in possession he looked good.  We never had our midfield join in for attacks, looked very scattered up front.  Johnstone, Schneiderlin and Darmian really stood out."
reddevils,3dpbue,MrD3ath,5,Sat Jul 18 03:59:09 2015 UTC,"Looked pretty shit. Little cohesion in the team, slow to move the ball like in the poor runs of form last season. Depay has looked pretty good. Missed that easy ball to Young but otherwise has played some nice balls. He's being forced to play quite deep though which is annoying. Darmian has been meh and Schneiderlin has shown his qualities if not consistently. He's had some great passes which I didn't expect too much of.  This level of rustiness is to be expected though.  Johnstone doing well as a sweeper keeper."
reddevils,3dpbue,Hassi94,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:57 2015 UTC,Memphis looks slow
reddevils,3dpbue,czteryfiter,2,Sat Jul 18 03:57:09 2015 UTC,Maybe Rooney introduced him to the English Fish and Chips.
reddevils,3dpbue,aman27deep,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:10:39 2015 UTC,"Couldn't ask much more in first 45 of pre season, like the look of all the new guys. Johnstone also played great."
reddevils,3dpbue,danmaher,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:53:56 2015 UTC,"Darmian, Rooney and Johnstone seem to be the only ones who are match-fit."
reddevils,3dpbue,desivoltaire,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:54:02 2015 UTC,Good for the first pre-season game. Every time Memphis received the ball you could sense that something might happen. Most exciting player in the first half for sure
reddevils,3dpbue,MagoManuk,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:54:34 2015 UTC,"All the new signings have been seriously impressive showing off their own capabilities.  Memphis - Lovely flicks to Rooney and hold up play. Linking very well with the other forwards Schneiderlin - Such a gun. Amazing defensively - seeing him do those sexy interceptions for us is the best Darmian - Again fantastic defending, pace and passing  Edit - Johnstone such a beast racing off the line"
reddevils,3dpbue,Baskale,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:56:01 2015 UTC,"I love the link up between the attacking quadrant of Young, Memphis, Mata and Rooney.   However, it was frustrating to see Man Utd attack and then move back over and over."
reddevils,3dpbue,TheSacredSoul,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:56:09 2015 UTC,"Never expected to see this formation, and I'm confused as to why LvG likes Memphis in the hole over Mata."

reddevils,3dpbue,sup_bruv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:06:34 2015 UTC,"Out of the XI which played the first half, I was most impressed by Johnstone. Really played well as a sweeper."
reddevils,3dpbue,aman27deep,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:11:33 2015 UTC,"Best performance was Schneiderlin, because of the gpal and is fine display in midfield. If I had to say a poor one, maybe Carrick? His age is showing and he struggled to impact anything or put his foot on the tempo"
reddevils,3dpbue,MylesVE,3,Sat Jul 18 04:13:24 2015 UTC,"Him and Rooney looked like they were jet-lagged. for some reason. But only still pre-season. Think we can get another top year out of Carrick if we just manage him well, and provide 2 energetic midfielders next to him to do all the running."
reddevils,3dpbue,Schneidsteiger,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:33:12 2015 UTC,Agreed. Wouldn't be surprised to see Carrick next to Schneiderlin and Herrera a lot

reddevils,3dpbue,Januzajed,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:11:39 2015 UTC,"Carrick seemed sloppy. The stand out performers were Schneiderlin, Young & Darmian."

reddevils,3dpbue,MenofStraw,-1,Sat Jul 18 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"Not gonna lie I didn't notice much of Darmian because I was too busy watching Depay and Schneiderlin, glad to hear he's been doing well though.   Everything seems alright so far bar the selfish moment from Depay. Looking forward to seeing Lingard and Periera in the second half."
reddevils,3dpbue,TheJoshider10,0,Sat Jul 18 03:54:50 2015 UTC,Depay has been good at holding up play..should've passed it to young though  Darmian has looked solid..good going forward as well.  Schneiderlin got the goal :P His distribution has been good as well.  Can't wait to see Bastian play!

reddevils,3dtwhv,TY1901,20,Sun Jul 19 12:37:57 2015 UTC,let it go OP. just let it go..
reddevils,3dtwhv,deanjoker,18,Sun Jul 19 13:25:14 2015 UTC,I doubt it. He's 30 now and even though he's still unbelievably good no team would be willing to match the asking price the Madrid would ask for the sake of 3 or 4 years. I'm interested to see who he finishes his career with but I'd bet good money that it won't be us.
reddevils,3dtwhv,Irishane,2,Sun Jul 19 12:47:21 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on the not buying him for 3/4 years sake but I think there's still a chance he might play a season at United. But if I'm being honest, I frankly don't care if he returns out not ever since Fergie's retirement."
reddevils,3dtwhv,gleek_master,2,Sun Jul 19 13:43:14 2015 UTC,i had hope with beckham maybe coming back before retiring.
reddevils,3dtwhv,maxdarche,2,Sun Jul 19 14:47:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah he's at that point now where he's played more games for Madrid than for us. He's always held the club in high regard but Fergie gone more or less makes it more a dream than a reality, especially since the Ronaldo we want back is the one right now in his prime and not the one we'd get which will be towards the end of his career where he's not really the same player.   Personally I think a move back to Portugal would be a good end to his career. It'd be insane if he moved to Madeira (Club Maritimo) to end his career. That would do absolutely wonders for the place."
reddevils,3dtwhv,TheJoshider10,7,Sun Jul 19 15:04:21 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I think he'll eventually move to MLS or one of those leagues with a lot of money.
reddevils,3dtwhv,omegaxLoL,4,Sun Jul 19 12:47:13 2015 UTC,Yup. Looks like the world-class player model now.

reddevils,3dtwhv,TheJoshider10,3,Sun Jul 19 15:13:38 2015 UTC,I doubt he ever will. I predict He will continue to play for Madrid for another few years before likely moving to the MLS at the age of 34 where he'll be earning a fair wage. Nobody else will pay the kind of money he'll want for a player of his age.
reddevils,3dtwhv,ReflectingGod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:46:11 2015 UTC,I don't see Ronaldo going to the MLS. Then again i didn't see Pirlo going that way.
reddevils,3dtwhv,jjkenneth,4,Sun Jul 19 12:46:48 2015 UTC,Can't help but feel he'll end up in Miami. The star power of Becks and Ronaldo together just seems like fate.
reddevils,3dtwhv,ReflectingGod,2,Sun Jul 19 13:15:55 2015 UTC,I just can't imagine where else he'd end up. I'm sure United fans would welcome him back open arms but I can't see the management doing the same.

reddevils,3dtwhv,ioannsukhariev,3,Sun Jul 19 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"but Sneijder and Robben were not deemed good enough by Real Madrid   they weren't 'deemed not good enough' by real madrid, they were sent away by florentino perez in his first summer back because he spent nearly €300M in new signings (kaka, ronaldo, xabi alonso, benzema) and both robben and sneijder were 'star' signings from the previous president.  they were also 25 years old when they left real madrid. cristiano will be turning 31 in january."
reddevils,3dtwhv,SonnyisKing,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:24:35 2015 UTC,well if a 30 year old Ronaldo can scored 62 goals and make 20 assists then yeah I wouldn't mind 31 year old Ronaldo at all.

reddevils,3dtwhv,ReflectingGod,2,Sun Jul 19 12:39:00 2015 UTC,He is like 10 goals off Raul's club record. I'm assuming he'd not only like to beat it but smash it silly. In the space of two seasons he could be 100 goals ahead of it.
reddevils,3dtwhv,Kenzhiki,4,Sun Jul 19 12:44:19 2015 UTC,Has he beaten Rauls goal record for madrid?
reddevils,3dtwhv,Kenzhiki,9,Sun Jul 19 12:43:28 2015 UTC,He is 10 goals off which definitely won't take 3 or 4 seasons for him to achieve. If he has the same start he had last season it would take him like 5 games.
reddevils,3dtwhv,EV1988,-1,Sun Jul 19 12:48:09 2015 UTC,Never said it will take that long. But i don't see him leaving anytime soon.

reddevils,3dn6sv,GroteBergMan98,7,Fri Jul 17 18:02:39 2015 UTC,"Of course we brief the press. What do you think press conferences are?   We just don't tell them what Ed is having for breakfast anymore, and that's why there's a lot less info than the beginning of his reign."
reddevils,3dn6sv,duckofwolfstreet,7,Fri Jul 17 21:15:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's obvious but people still argue that we don't. People on here have claimed that Jackson / Ogden are clueless whenever they both publish articles at the same time and that they have no connections within the club. When the club want a story out in the media, these are the guys they go to.  We are keeping our transfer activity on the down low, so they aren't informed about most transfer dealings any more, but they do have connections and are briefed at the club, which people often argue against. It seems like this likely came from an interview with Ed, though."
reddevils,3dn6sv,jammybear,2,Fri Jul 17 21:19:18 2015 UTC,Oh definitely. He probably got them up on a conference call from a beach and told them what's up. There's no way we could survive without feeding the media things like this.
reddevils,3dn6sv,duckofwolfstreet,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:26:04 2015 UTC,Interesting point in the guardian article that by not having him sign now and then letting him leave we're saving about £10m in salary. If you presume we'd get about £25m now that softens the blow of next summers loss a little bit.
reddevils,3dn6sv,noneedtoshowmeround,45,Fri Jul 17 21:14:31 2015 UTC,Great to see this.  Losing De Gea is a blow but at least we're doing it with a bit of pride and defiance. Real Madrid can fuck off.

reddevils,3dn6sv,omegaxLoL,12,Fri Jul 17 17:30:52 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't care about the sale price given our income. He was always going to be undervalued in any transfer anyways so if we keep him for another year I will be chuffed.  If he pulls a Reus and signs a contract this summer even with his sights set on a move next year that would be awesome, seeing as we could actually sell him for something."
reddevils,3dn6sv,tigranater,2,Fri Jul 17 21:07:40 2015 UTC,Couldn't agree more.
reddevils,3dn6sv,osorojotx,4,Fri Jul 17 19:35:52 2015 UTC,Anyone else think that this is dodgy? It appears that they've made an agreement with DDG to pay him extra 5million euro to come for free if he plays out the last year. Isnt there some sort of legal issue here as he is under contract?
reddevils,3dn6sv,vidman33,3,Fri Jul 17 22:51:52 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make much sense, Madrid want him this summer its us that are putting the block on that.  But if they had spoken to De Gea or his agent and negotiated anything then this would be tapping up and would be illegal."
reddevils,3dn6sv,Hollacaine,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:46:54 2015 UTC,so he's been promised 5million if he waits out the season and signs for free in a years time. How is that not tapping up? not being contrary just don't really understand how its not.
reddevils,3dn6sv,vidman33,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"He hasn't been promised 5 million though. Madrid want him this summer, he wants to go this summer. Theres no deal for him to wait it out."

reddevils,3dlxu0,teddypicks,115,Fri Jul 17 09:55:17 2015 UTC,Clearly he meant the saxophone lady needs a cello player to balance the music out and then maybe another midfielder ;-)
reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,16,Fri Jul 17 10:24:48 2015 UTC,I'm not sure a cello is what we need for balance. Has to be an enforcer type. Maybe a drummer?

reddevils,3dlxu0,Allthatisbrownisgold,2,Fri Jul 17 11:34:09 2015 UTC,So no CB or no ST.  Personally i think a striker is the more pressing concern.
reddevils,3dlxu0,blacksheeping,4,Fri Jul 17 10:35:14 2015 UTC,"We cannot go into next season with the chance of Mcnair or Blackett having to play against Barca or Madrid, I'd get over Wilson playing against them but we can't have youth playing in Europe and Evans hopefully won't be here."
reddevils,3dlxu0,kw9403,17,Fri Jul 17 14:16:18 2015 UTC,If Hernandez is staying we have no problem there.
reddevils,3dlxu0,G_Morgan,20,Fri Jul 17 10:36:50 2015 UTC,"True.  I like Hernandez, i would just be surprised if he came back into Van Gaals thinking after letting him go out on Loan last year.  I could be wrong."
reddevils,3dlxu0,blacksheeping,14,Fri Jul 17 10:39:04 2015 UTC,I was thinking like this at first but he may have let him go out on loan because realistically who would have thought he was a better option than Falcao and rvp. He might still really like the player and want to give him a shot. I'm sure he could have sold him if he had no long term plans for him.
reddevils,3dlxu0,Cuban_Mahogany,7,Fri Jul 17 11:01:49 2015 UTC,"He sent him on loan because he knew he wouldn't get time ahead of Falcao, RvP, and Rooney. And whatever times he would have gotten would be better used for Wilson.   At least that's my assumption as to why it was a loan and not a sale"
reddevils,3dlxu0,badgarok725,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:46:43 2015 UTC,Reports are that West Ham Bid and got rejected so that means either West Ham didn't give enough money or he's staying
reddevils,3dlxu0,HispanicAtTehDisco,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:08:34 2015 UTC,Yes.  Those are the two possibilities.
reddevils,3dlxu0,blacksheeping,6,Fri Jul 17 17:43:35 2015 UTC,Of course another is needed. It's one injury to Rooney from being just Wilson and an already injured Hernandez. That's not good enough. Plus Hernandez is nothing more than an option off the bench.
reddevils,3dlxu0,WillyMorganOnTheWing,8,Fri Jul 17 11:26:59 2015 UTC,"I think we're in a difficult situation. Because if we sign a world class striker then it means that it'll be a choice between that striker and Rooney for the one striker position. Rooney also (touch wood) doesn't tend to be very injury prone, so I'd be happy with Rooney first choice, Hernandez just behind, Wilson to be given a chance and then you also have Depay, Fellaini (hopefully not) and Januzaj who can also play there."
reddevils,3dlxu0,craigybacha,3,Fri Jul 17 12:06:01 2015 UTC,"United are not limited to signing established ""world class"" players from the top end of the market. My preference is somebody around 22 who could start if needed."
reddevils,3dlxu0,WillyMorganOnTheWing,5,Fri Jul 17 12:35:45 2015 UTC,Why is that not Wilson ?
reddevils,3dlxu0,rogues69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:33:27 2015 UTC,He isn't even mildly proven capable of playing in the top flight. He's also just one person.
reddevils,3dlxu0,WillyMorganOnTheWing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:02:31 2015 UTC,what around 22 year old proven top flight player would you suggest?
reddevils,3dlxu0,dwaters11,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"He hasn't shown enough, IMO."
reddevils,3dlxu0,HorriBliss,0,Fri Jul 17 16:19:59 2015 UTC,Unless he's played he won't grow as a player. Think he's shown enough potential to merit a chance. Who knows he has a Kane type season
reddevils,3dlxu0,rogues69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:26:03 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have another striker who can play the full 90 minutes, don't think Hernandez does his best work unless he plays the last 20-25"
reddevils,3dlxu0,CornDogMillionaire,14,Fri Jul 17 10:44:05 2015 UTC,"Remember that time Hernandez put 3 past Aston Villa in the dying minutes of the game? We were losing before that, and the strikers before him couldn't do it.  That season he had one of the best Goal/minute ratio in Europe. I don't think it should matter if he doesn't do his best work in a full 90."
reddevils,3dlxu0,greatGoD67,5,Fri Jul 17 10:54:35 2015 UTC,"How does that refute the point that he is just an option off the bench? United need somebody that could step up if Rooney is injured, suspended, off form etc.   Plus one game against Villa in a season where he was at a level he was not since replicated is not a sign he'll do that next season."

reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:15:47 2015 UTC,"Am I meant to list why he is not good enough for every comment? People are deluded if they believe a strike force of Rooney, Wilson and Hernandez is good enough to start the season.   Hernandez lacks a lot in his game. He can do the odd good touch and can do simple passes - as he is a good player - but he is no good at swift passages and he isn't a presence. He is loved by a lot on here so he is made out to be a lot better then he is. If LVG didn't rate him last year, then I don't really know what has changed."

He's been good at the quick passages as of late especially so actually.   LvG didn't not rate him- he just felt there weren't enough games last season as he himself said and Hernandez too so he suggested a loan.
reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,5,Fri Jul 17 11:57:13 2015 UTC,"He isn't a presence? Neither is Rooney really a huge presence. --- yeah, he isn't. Rooney is a big strong man, who is a presence up top.   If LVG rated him highly he wouldn't gone on loan. If Real Madrid rated him as a sub they would have bought him. He isn't that good. He seems like a nice fella, has scored some great goals and is willing, but he is not a top player and not good for Utd in my opinion."
reddevils,3dlxu0,OhHayJohn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:01:30 2015 UTC,He demands to start games and he's not good enough to start games. Unless he has a massive personality change around and accepts his level and works on his game he is more trouble than he's worth.

reddevils,3dlxu0,jimmyjammaay,26,Fri Jul 17 09:58:49 2015 UTC,Likely a CB and maybe a Gk option as Valdes is leaving and he mentioned last year he didn't think Lindegaard was suitable for the type of keeper he wants. Possibly striker too of course but I'm just saying I won't be surprised if it's CB and Gk.
reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,16,Fri Jul 17 10:26:02 2015 UTC,"He does say at least two positions so I'm sure he's open to options in GK, CB and ST. I reckon if he can pull a big name for ST he will go for it without hesitation."
reddevils,3dlxu0,serenity10,5,Fri Jul 17 11:18:46 2015 UTC,Maybe striker/forward/winger type. Depending on whether di Maria leaves.
reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:26:49 2015 UTC,Yeah good point. It's too late now but if we sold ADM I would have liked to get Shaqiri. 23 years old and a physical beast. We could have got him cheap like Stoke did and used the ADM money for a big name CB signing.   Now I'm not sure who to get? Greizmann would be amazing but he'll cost a fortune too.
reddevils,3dlxu0,serenity10,12,Fri Jul 17 11:40:27 2015 UTC,Shaqiri isn't anywhere near good enough as of late though.

reddevils,3dlxu0,serenity10,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:04:17 2015 UTC,"The problem with Greizmann is we'd have no one to actually create chances and play the final ball.  ------------------Schweinsteiger---------------------  -------------Herrera--------Schneiderlin------------  ----Greizmann---------------------Memphis---------  --------------------Rooney----------------------------  There's not one player in that lineup who's genuinely brilliant at playing the final pass and creating chances.  The best in Herrera and he wasn't even in the top 100 in the PL last season in chances created. Obviously we also have Mata but LVG has shown absolutely zero indication or willingness at all to ever play Mata in midfield in the 4-3-3 despite a lot of chances to pick him there. So it's safe to assume to me he doesn't consider him able to play that role.  If Di Maria goes we need a like for like replacement, i.e someone to create chances not someone to get on the end of them."
reddevils,3dlxu0,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:05:12 2015 UTC,"You make a solid point and I agree. With certain players though I do believe LVG is capable of moulding them into what is best for the team. Memphis is only 21 years old and sure he is more of a solo scorer, but I have no doubt that LVG is capable of turning him into a team-player and he could start racking up assists when he is surrounded by quality players. The same can be said for other young players too."
reddevils,3dlxu0,serenity10,2,Fri Jul 17 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"You can mold an individualist/scorer type like Memphis into more of a team player sure but he's never going to become an Iniesta or Silva, there's only so far you can go.  We need one Memphis/Greizmann/Bale/Ronaldo winger and one Iniesta/Silva/Isco type winger.  We have that balance at the moment with Di Maria and Memphis in theory but if ADM leaves we need to replace him with another player like that, not with a goalscorer we can maybe over the course of a season or three turn into more of a team player."

But you're also right to suggest the wing although, I honestly don't see whom we can sign there though as the ones much better aren't available of sorts or rather, a huge long ball upfield and hope it lands somewhere good.   Reus- not an option I'm really thinking.   Bale- bloody ridiculous price and also Perez's pride at stake.   Griezmann- Atletico and Simeone are a very strong pull to stay for him honestly after how he's transformed there under him and how they aren't slouches in football as well.   Who else fits the criteria of being an improvement to our selection?   Cavani as striker? Yes as an option he would be as good as Rooney/better/similar level so that would improve our selection but I don't see us trying for him maybe."
reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,5,Fri Jul 17 10:29:06 2015 UTC,"Greizmann is our best bet I think. He has a clause so the club can't stop us - it's down to him - big money move with a big wage upgrade with a french man already here? could be enticing enough and he's perfect for our needs. Two direct wingers like Depay and Greizmann would be lovely. I know he's on the left mostly if he plays on the wings but he's stronger with his left foot so he can cut in from the right and LvG likes inverted wingers.  Apart from that, Felipe Anderson perhaps? Guy has massive talent and would cost a fuck ton but if he progresses to the level of his talent, he'll be worth - him and Depay on opposite wings could give us a partnership for the next decade. He's been outstanding every time I've seen him play on the right for Lazio."
reddevils,3dlxu0,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:37:51 2015 UTC,"I think Griezmann really likes Atletico and Simeone though so it's akin to us and Memphis almost. I doubt he wants to leave.   Money isn't everything for several footballers which is nice to see as well. Especially now that he's doing very well already and the euros are next year so, he wouldn't want to take a risk now I can imagine as he needs to then settle and all again with us."
reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,3,Fri Jul 17 10:42:08 2015 UTC,"The Euros is a good point, makes players adjusting to a new league a difficult prospect to say yes to. I'd have to agree, the chances of him signing are very low but it's relatively higher than Reus (shown serious commitment + new contract) or Bale (outrageous money). I still think Anderson can be an exciting option, what are your thoughts on him?"
reddevils,3dlxu0,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:45:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I mean he is almost a guaranteed starter so that could make it a BIT easier perhaps to agree to a move but I think his sentiments are quite strong for Atletico though somehow or rather.   Anderson - I've no idea about him at all so I can't say anything really other than, Brazilian, plays well, yearns for barca or madrid later. Maybe. Well... But I don't know how good he is other than having heard people say he's very good and has a lot of potential too.   I can't think of anyone else who would improve our selection as LvG said for the wide role though so... It'll be interesting to see indeed. Could well be another position instead."
reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:51:55 2015 UTC,Yeah it'll be interesting to see what LvG decides - I'm just glad he's confirmed that the transfer train isn't over :3

reddevils,3dlxu0,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:07:52 2015 UTC,"Surprised nobody has been linked with Griezmann in almost a month. Even then, I'm not sure United have ever been linked - or at least for this window. They have no choice but to accept the fee and I'm sure he won't be too hard to get him to sign as we'll no doubt triple his current £50k a week wages if needed to.  I'd also love to see Anderson but I'm not sure just yet if he is good enough. I'd get him in as a squad player regardless as he will no doubt be one of the worlds best in a few years time. I heard someone quote him at £40m the other day though..."

reddevils,3dlxu0,tmutton,2,Fri Jul 17 13:03:16 2015 UTC,"Well duh....  Who expected us to be finished with this window?!  We're in need of a striker, a centre back, a goalie (maybe even two goalies) and potentially a winger or someone to play in a top three.  Griezmann would be perfect. He would add a new dynamic to the squad and he was voted to lead the frontline with Ronaldo and Messi as part of La Liga's team of the the season. His buy-out clause is 45m I believe (someone correct me on that) but my worry is that if we wait until next season after Euro 2016 - there might be severe competition looking for his signature. I'd do everything I could to get him in ASAP.  De Gea and Valdes leaving - Romero is coming in as a backup keeper. I still think Hugo Lloris is on the cards even though he hurt his wrist - but seeing as Spurs have said he'll be fine in two weeks it's obviously nothing to be overly concerned about. The thing with Lloris is that he has, statistically, made the most saves over the last Premier League season - Yes, that's right - he made more saves than David de Gea.   Centre Back - Otamendi is a done deal as far as I'm concerned. And with Valdes going to Valencia with some reports saying Rafael going too this is a done deal. Complete."

reddevils,3dlxu0,Thebotchedlegdrop,2,Fri Jul 17 20:28:10 2015 UTC,"A CB and a winger is what I'd personally prioritize. With Di Maria looking set to go, I think it'd only make sense that we get a proper world class winger. I've said it before and I'll say it again, a player like Griezmann would be ideal as it'd be like killing two birds with one stone because he can play on the wing but would also be a fantastic backup striker (solving our striker ""crisis"") with Mata or a youth player moving into the RW position in his place.  I'd be slightly disappointed if we came out of this transfer window having not bought a proper winger and I'll be even more disappointed if we do and that winger happens to be Nicolás Gaitán."
reddevils,3dlxu0,ReflectingGod,2,Fri Jul 17 10:49:32 2015 UTC,Not a winger. We have Young and Depay. It's not like we were missing Di Maria when he didn't start last season.
reddevils,3dlxu0,too-many-people,2,Fri Jul 17 12:03:06 2015 UTC,"So you're happy to be playing Young on the wing? He had a good season (though his final product was awful) but isn't good enough to be playing week in week out especially if we want any chance of winning silverware. He is going to be a valuable squad player but simply isn't good enough to be in a top 4 starting 11 on a regular basis.  Notice in my comment how I didn't use the word replace. Why? Because Di Maria never needed replacing, he never fit into the team and wasn't much of a winger, hence why we never missed him. What we did miss is a player with his creativity, pace, ability to beat a man which was especially apparent down the RW last year part of which was to do with Valencia offering little going forward but also because we were playing Mata there out of position. He wasn't bad in the position but he certainly wasn't the quality we should be looking to sign. We need a world class winger - Mata and Young don't fit the bill.   Again, getting a winger like Griezmann would not only fix the wingers problem but the strikers problem."
reddevils,3dlxu0,ReflectingGod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:55:25 2015 UTC,"My point was that if LVG is only signing two more players it should be a GK, CB or Striker, not a winger. We have plenty of players for 4-3-3 or 4-3-2-1."
reddevils,3dlxu0,too-many-people,0,Fri Jul 17 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"That's where I disagree. If we're talking senior players, we only have Depay and Young as natural wingers and in my opinion, Young isn't good enough. Depay isn't even proven lol. We need goal scoring wingers for his preferred 4-3-3 formation. Griezmann would be that winger but also the striker. I see him as a similar player to Bale and Ronaldo as in you could put them anywhere in a front three including CF and they'd score plenty of goals - CF is a side position of his.   A player like Griezmann would be your striker but when Rooney isn't being rested or isn't injured, he'd be the winger. We are not going to get a backup striker of world class quality hence why I think we should get a winger like Griezmann who would improve the first team drastically but would also solve the strikers crisis."

The Lpool game was scary in the second half, they played better when they had 10 men and when Sturridge scored it was very hard to watch, although after the final whistle it was very satisfying."
reddevils,3dobyh,reddit_no_likey,5,Fri Jul 17 23:08:26 2015 UTC,The City game was great. Especially seeing has we've struggled against them the past few seasons but nothing can beat the Liverpool game imo. United-Liverpool is the best game of the season no matter where Liverpool are on the table. It was also the game that decided top 4. We had a slight gap at that time but pretty much secured top 4 with that win. Also seeing Gerrard getting sent off in his last derby was hilarious and i was going apeshit when Mata pulled that second goal out of his locker. But the City game was incredible as well. Pretty close between the two but for me it's the liverpool game at Juanfield.

Can we hold any faith he'll resign? Probably not. But he's been a professional throughout the saga so I expect him to perform brilliantly all season.   And a bit of a fuck you Madrid.
reddevils,3dn654,pucykoks,25,Fri Jul 17 17:08:58 2015 UTC,"Well, Benitez is in charge. That gives de Gea one whole year to see what 'Benitez running a football club' looks like (yeah, like he's not gonna get fired before New Years')."

reddevils,3dn654,trustfundbaby,4,Fri Jul 17 17:38:04 2015 UTC,We get a full year to stablize the team (having a new keeper come in while the defense is still getting sorted out could be really tricky) and look for a new keeper without the distraction of looking for other players at the same time. I think it works out really well for United. United isn't going to be hurting for the cash.
reddevils,3dn654,MistaShaw,4,Fri Jul 17 17:51:53 2015 UTC,Well Madrid wanted him now. Because we won't sell him they have to wait a year and had to buy casilla so they had 2 goalkeepers. Taking the 13 million they reportedly offered is nowhere near the worth of having de gea for an extra year
reddevils,3dn654,MouthFartWankMotion,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:55:11 2015 UTC,"This is a difference of opinion. From what I've read and seen, I think that United doesn't care about the money, and would rather hold on to DDG for a year if they aren't going to get what they want right now (money and Ramos) from Madrid.  It's about taking a stand, even if we lose potential money on a free transfer."

reddevils,3dn654,BloodyMess111,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:40 2015 UTC,I think it would be a terrible idea to sign a new keeper now and let De Gea leave. If it were going to happen it should've been done weeks ago to allow a new keeper to have a full pre-season with the squad. If we let him go now it will be bad for the club. If we KNOW he is definitely going next summer it gives the club a year to sort out his replacement. I'm personally hoping for Leno but we don't appear to be getting linked all that much with him.

reddevils,3dn654,freckleddemon,6,Fri Jul 17 17:43:08 2015 UTC,Apparently they feel that they don't want to give the impression that they are being bullied by Real and hence will not accept even 25mil for him.

EDIT: Can the subreddit please just have a sensible discussion about a player leaving for one without anyone saying they think the player is going getting downvoted. Its happened with Nani, Hernandez, RVP and now DDG this summer."
reddevils,3dn654,Nestledrink,2,Fri Jul 17 17:11:24 2015 UTC,It's clear that the club is willing to forfeit the 25-30M by these articles.
reddevils,3dn654,Creamy_Goodne55,4,Fri Jul 17 17:16:23 2015 UTC,"At the minute to show their strength, which is 100% the right thing.   On deadline day when they havent budged on their offer and DDG has made it clear hes going, Imo it will be a different picture."
reddevils,3dn654,Nestledrink,2,Fri Jul 17 17:22:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on Dave.  If Dave submitted transfer request we probably will let him go. Until then, I think the club is ready to forgo the 25-30M in money and letting him go for free next year."
reddevils,3dn654,rdev1l,3,Fri Jul 17 17:22:22 2015 UTC,"There is no chance DDG will be sold on deadline day for even £100m.  If it happens, it will happen before the CL qualifier and we would want plenty of time to find a worthwhile replacement."
reddevils,3dn654,WRCousCous,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:25:38 2015 UTC,"I would absolutely see it as a win. The only win bigger would be if he signs between now and January.

Contingency planning and all."
reddevils,3dn654,Miwanik,41,Fri Jul 17 17:36:45 2015 UTC,"He should have signed his extension in the winter, United would have gotten good money and he would have gotten his move.

reddevils,3dn654,mink_man,19,Fri Jul 17 17:38:08 2015 UTC,"A contract is there to protect the player and the employer. We signed him for 5 years service, if we get 5 years service from him and leaves then it's no fault of DDG. I don;t have a problem with it at all.

reddevils,3dn654,fat-chunk,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:01:27 2015 UTC,"What we should have done is offered him a new contract earlier, in the summer when Van Gaal arrived.  We knew of his potential and abilities before he went and had his world class season. He probably wasn't on Real's radar back then and would have likely agreed if we offered him enough money. He was young and keepers don't tend to suddenly decline, so we should have pinned him down to a longer contract."

reddevils,3dn654,therosepetal,6,Fri Jul 17 17:15:15 2015 UTC,I think we all knew this would happen eventually and I was actually happy to read all the tweets just some minutes ago from reporters that we will keep de Gea for another year but then I read Cillessen is on the frame to be his replacement and that just changed it all. I really really hope we will go for Oblak/Leno instead....
reddevils,3dn654,AnOrangeDinosaur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:23:52 2015 UTC,"As an Ajax/NED fan first and United second, why the Cillessen hate?"
reddevils,3dn654,therosepetal,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:27:01 2015 UTC,"It's no hate at all. I'm Dutch myself. I like Cillessen and I think he's an 'okay' GK but he's not good enough for Manchester United. He's 26, still plays in the Eredivise and no big club is interested in him at all. The only reason why he's linked to Manchester United is because van Gaal and van Gaal is also the reason IF we buy him. I see way more potential in Leno and Oblak. For me they are both right now very very good GK and both are still very young."
reddevils,3dn654,AnOrangeDinosaur,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:35 2015 UTC,"I can't particularly disagree with any of your statements. I haven't seen Oblak or Leno play, so I don't know if they're any good. Yes, Cillessen isn't a De Gea or Courtios, but I'd be ok if we signed him. His shitty Ajax and Netherlands defenses don't help him at all either and for a GK, 26 isn't old at all."

reddevils,3dn654,Creamy_Goodne55,0,Fri Jul 17 22:46:22 2015 UTC,"I just dont see it.  If DDG makes it clear to the club that hes leaving on a free next year he will be out the door when the club come back in August.   I just dont see a situation where the club lets this go on all season, with every journalist and pundit asking about his future and deep down the club and player knows hes just going through the motions until he leaves next year."
reddevils,3dn654,jbiresq,2,Fri Jul 17 17:08:49 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I think the club is taking a stance here. I could totally see us selling him on Deadline day but I don't think it will be for 25 million.
reddevils,3dn654,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:07:59 2015 UTC,Selling him on deadline day would be the stupidest thing to do from a footballing perspective. How the heck can we get a replacement that quickly then?

Say what you want, but Real Madrid is a very attractive club You don't know if he gives a fuck about trophies, I sure as hell wouldn't care less if I won trophies when I'm already earning more money in a month than most people earn throughout their entire life. How does being an Atletico fan prohibits him from wanting to play in fucking Real Madrid ?    Seriously some of you people should get your head out of your asses. Not every player wants to stay in one club for their entire life . De Gea will fulfill his contract and he can do whatever he wants. If he wants to join Real Madrid, then he should do that. Being angry about it is basically the same thing as being angry at Manchester United for not offering him 20 year contract instead of a 5 year one."
reddevils,3dn654,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:14:39 2015 UTC,Well some Atletico fans and players never want to play for Real Madrid. Like they genuinely hate madrid for the rivalry and would never move there. Akin to Liverpool and us at times.

Atletico aren't offering him anything.   They're the biggest club in Spain too.   So... Yeah. He pretty much doesn't care about money or his loyalties to Atletico as we can see but it isn't like Atletico are making an offer and he turned it down either.

reddevils,3dnqhf,Rbotiq,11,Sat Jul 18 05:31:51 2015 UTC,"His comments about getting a holding midfielder during the last week really make me think that Carrick will be phased out this season, or at least rotated with Schweinsteiger often. Can't help but feel it's for the best.  Sounds like the signings for this season were much more well planned than last season. He's very aware of what the team is lacking in order to be able to challenge for all 4 competitions we're in.  Genuinely cannot wait to watch these pre-season matches. Managed to play some great football last pre-season when the team only had LvG as the manager for a month or so, should be even better this time around. Just wish it'd transition to the league and our other competitions this time around."
reddevils,3dnqhf,omegaxLoL,9,Fri Jul 17 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah it will probably be beneficial for Carrick if he's rotated next season. LvG clearly still values him and knows how good he is, hence the contract extension, but also knows that we can't rely on him being fit every week any more."

reddevils,3dnqhf,kmp214246,3,Fri Jul 17 20:45:05 2015 UTC,I wonder if his means Schneiderlin will be played as a CM along with Herrera then? Surely there's no way he'll be on the bench...
reddevils,3dnqhf,jammybear,6,Fri Jul 17 21:29:28 2015 UTC,This is what I'm most looking forward to see. Schneiderlin would provide great cover for Herrera to push forward more.  We have great options in midfield. It feels good.
reddevils,3dnqhf,kmp214246,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:03:05 2015 UTC,"If Schneiderlin plays CDM then we have 4 CDMs but only 2 true CMs in Herrera and Fellaini for 2 positions, Schneiderlin will play CM."
reddevils,3dnqhf,januzaj_44,5,Fri Jul 17 23:11:17 2015 UTC,"(first post ever on Reddit :) )   Most interesting points for me were obviously speaking about Bastian as a holding midfielder. Knowing how highly LVG thinks of Carrick and how important he feels the fact that Schneiderlin is proven in the PL, I personally deduce that at least two of the three of those shall play most of the time. If Carrick plays alongside Bastian I imagine their partnership to mimic that of Khedira and Bastian for Germany, where it was well analysed just how well they did at making sure at least one of them dropped back when the other attacked. We know Carrick only ever ever presses forward when we are really really dominant AND chasing the game so I imagine Bastian playing the role of Scholes (when Scholes and Carrick dominated matches and nobody seemingly noticed Carrick) in that case - playing deep - pinging the ball 20-50 yards to the wings, or feeding it into Herrara/Mata/Depay/Rooney and arriving late in the box himself when possible.   If that's the case, playing 2 DMs essentially makes them both CMs as you imagine those 2 players with another CM or AM or LAM or RAM would dominate most of the possession in midfield which we know is part of the philosophy. That allows more playing time both Schneiderlin and Blind to play alongside either of those players. Schneiderlin ahead of Blind who will also be rotating at LB.   What's also interesting is the fact that LVG said that everyone is fit - initially I read between the lines and assumed he had discounted Hernandez from his plans altogether because everyone he wanted to be on tour was on tour. Could just mean that everyone on tour is fit (which is obviously the case as otherwise they wouldn't be on tour) and I was just over-thinking an off the cuff remark intended to compare the situation to last season."
reddevils,3dnqhf,superironthorman,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:27:16 2015 UTC,"Congrats on the first post! But I would have to say that I would be very surprised if both Carrick and Schweinsteiger play together. Bastion struggled alongside Alonso at FCB because there's a lack of mobility with them playing together. The same would be the case of he played with Carrick. One or the other will play is my feeling, not both at the same time."

reddevils,3dm894,theangrycamel,7,Fri Jul 17 12:21:34 2015 UTC,"I think Schneiderlin has the teeth to do really well at Old Trafford. He obviously is coming into a club that has a history of midfielders with great teeth, with Scholes and Keane but he's got the natural whiteness to fit right in.  Also helps that Carrick is still there too, which will only help Schneiderlin and the development of his teeth and we might even see Schneiderlin outperform Carrick in this department before the end of the season. It will obviously be a different role for his teeth but one I firmly believer he can get stuck in to.  TL;DR Schneiderlin might be using better toothpaste than Carrick by the end of the season."

I'd rather play de gea in the reserves for a year and write of £25 million than become seen as a feeder club to Madrid. Look at aresnal and spurs, they are week,  long term both players and clubs know they will sell up if a larger team comes and it not only affects the talent that comes into the club it also erodes any sense of championship mentality that is needed to continually challenge for big prizes. Spanish speaking players need to stop this dangerous thought that they are waiting their time before just moving ship to barca/madrid.   I think this sends a powerful message to the younger guys and rest of the football community in general, we aren't here to be fucked around to save a few quid. In fact LVG is the perfect manager to cut the fat I think, if you want to stay fight for your place - if you want to leave then you leave on our terms."

This is a completely different situation, there was no way in hell Rooney was ever going to sit and leave the club on a free, if push came to shove United would have accepted the 30-40 million offer that Chelsea was willing to pay. With DDG there is more than a slight chance that he will leave on a free and after September 1st there is nothing the club can do about it."

reddevils,3dnz56,thatshitlerscanoe,2,Fri Jul 17 21:06:24 2015 UTC,"you are correct. One of the big things the MLS is trying to stress with new teams is that you have to have a soccer specific stadium. By the city allowing them to build a stadium, they should be able to get an expansion team."
reddevils,3dnz56,AllWeAreIsGolden,-2,Fri Jul 17 21:08:58 2015 UTC,"They need a specific stadium to play football?  Surely, the NFL would rent it out to other sports? Or am I mistaken?

reddevils,3dnz56,ohyou123,6,Fri Jul 17 21:34:29 2015 UTC,I'm sure that stadiums could be rented just fine. But the MLS commissioner is really keen on expanding the sport in America. And if you have stadiums specific for the sport then it would a long way into showing that they are serious about getting people into the sport. But like you said I'm sure eventually once America is a football country then stadiums could be rented to new teams.
reddevils,3dnz56,Sokkerboi,2,Fri Jul 17 21:55:34 2015 UTC,"I'm not an expert, but from what I gather, the MLS is really keen on making sure clubs are set up in the right way, and ran in the right way, so ensure they have all the infrastructure to survive, and don't overpay on wages, which is why they can only have some designated players"

reddevils,3dlxmc,WillyMorganOnTheWing,32,Fri Jul 17 09:59:02 2015 UTC,"United (or any English club) will not actually activate a buyout clause for a player in Spain. The 2 clubs may agree a fee near the buyout clause, but United would need to pay a massive extra cost in tax on top of the payment to Otamendi to activate the buyout clause.  A buyout clause in Spain does not mean that United can simply pay that amount and get the player."
reddevils,3dlxmc,dbelle92,8,Fri Jul 17 11:30:50 2015 UTC,Doesn't the player have to pay it himself or something?

reddevils,3dlxmc,WillyMorganOnTheWing,2,Fri Jul 17 14:50:32 2015 UTC,No it wasn't. United and Bilbao agreed a fee that was 99.9% of his buyout clause.
reddevils,3dlxmc,phorner23,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:42 2015 UTC,Do you have a source for that?  Because I remember the stories last summer were that we gave him the money to pay his buyout clause.

reddevils,3dlxmc,WillyMorganOnTheWing,2,Fri Jul 17 19:05:26 2015 UTC,"Ander Herrera himself has said that United paid the €36m fee to Bilbao. Again it is the same as I have said before, clubs agree to sell for the price of the buyout clause but they are technically not activating it."
reddevils,3dlxmc,phorner23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:35:02 2015 UTC,"Actually now that you mention it, I do remember the deal being like that.  It's to avoid the legal fees, taxes and everything that comes with activating the buyout clause if I'm not mistaken right?"

reddevils,3dlxmc,DoctorWitten,3,Sat Jul 18 15:49:44 2015 UTC,that's interesting. so do you have any idea how much we'd actually be paying for Otamendi if we activated his buyout clause?
reddevils,3dlxmc,WillyMorganOnTheWing,25,Fri Jul 17 11:46:19 2015 UTC,"It could be up to 50% more. But it never happens. What normally happens is that the clubs agree a fee close to the ""buyout"" clause and then their club President can use the clause as an excuse. A foreign club that actually genuinely tried to activate a buyout clause could see themselves in months of legal negotiations. Bayern Munich are probably one of the few who tried it with Martinez and it isn't really clear how that was resolved.  United would be taxed massively on what is essentially a gift of money to the player. A buyout clause is activated by the player themselves and exists due to Spanish labour laws. No matter how many times people say it, it isn't a release clause.   Release clauses are a different thing and normally only happen at clubs who sign promising players and whose agent agrees the clause with an eye on them being sold. Newcastle are an example of a team who sign players to those agreements and who know that ultimately they are getting a good player for a year or two before selling them."
reddevils,3dlxmc,DoctorWitten,7,Fri Jul 17 12:02:41 2015 UTC,"wow, i had no idea there was so much red tape attached to buyout clauses. thanks for the info."

reddevils,3dlxmc,dbelle92,8,Fri Jul 17 14:17:48 2015 UTC,And because they have to sign the majority of their players from Basque or something. Not sure on the specifics.
reddevils,3dlxmc,jbiresq,6,Fri Jul 17 14:49:23 2015 UTC,They won't have any non Basque players so they always demand the buyout clause.

reddevils,3dlxmc,cgcr7,-3,Fri Jul 17 16:05:41 2015 UTC,36mil is the buyout so roughly mid 50's I think. (Head math do not take with much credibility).

reddevils,3dlxmc,MattARC,4,Fri Jul 17 10:45:21 2015 UTC,That's Rio levels of money for a CD. Not sure if I rate Otamendi as high as that...
reddevils,3dlxmc,4darsh2,24,Fri Jul 17 14:25:31 2015 UTC,"Rio was bought 13 years ago, times have changed. If you was to buy a 23 year old Rio today, i would imagine you would be topping what PSG paid for David Luiz."
reddevils,3dlxmc,FlyingSnoopy,17,Fri Jul 17 14:33:56 2015 UTC,It's a sad time in football when David Luiz is the most expensive CB in history.
reddevils,3dlxmc,IAmAQuantumMechanic,3,Fri Jul 17 14:40:38 2015 UTC,It's the inflated price for hair that made him so expensive.
reddevils,3dlxmc,HispanicAtTehDisco,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:04:15 2015 UTC,"He's apparently been pretty good for PSG, granted probably not 50m good, according to some of my PSG supporting friends"
reddevils,3dlxmc,FlyingSnoopy,3,Fri Jul 17 16:53:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I don't think that's the price for a player to perform pretty good in the mediocre French League."
reddevils,3dlxmc,HispanicAtTehDisco,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:05:10 2015 UTC,Yeah for 50m you would expect them to dominate the league
reddevils,3dlxmc,kiac,5,Fri Jul 17 18:06:52 2015 UTC,"That was 13 years ago, Rio now would be £50m."
reddevils,3dlxmc,Kilaskwiral,3,Fri Jul 17 14:34:48 2015 UTC,"Rio was over a decade ago though, prices have risen since then. Rio's fee would be over £40m in today's money"
reddevils,3dlxmc,MattARC,2,Fri Jul 17 14:34:19 2015 UTC,Fair enough. Didn't factor in inflation into my thought process.
reddevils,3dlxmc,Lost_And_NotFound,9,Fri Jul 17 14:35:33 2015 UTC,Does anyone know what wage he's on at the moment? I couldn't imagine that Valencia are paying their players anything that we couldn't
reddevils,3dlxmc,as520,5,Fri Jul 17 10:10:31 2015 UTC,"No idea, but this isn't the first time it's happened at Valencia, both Soldado and Mathieu have paid up from their wages to move to other clubs, given in the same article."
reddevils,3dlxmc,DiabeticZombie,11,Fri Jul 17 10:17:15 2015 UTC,Chelsea have just had a £20million bid rejected for John Stones but I was just wondering would you guys rather we spent £37million for Otamendi or rival Chelsea in getting Stones with a bid of around £30million?
reddevils,3dlxmc,mink551,24,Fri Jul 17 10:35:41 2015 UTC,Otamendi easily. Stones is not a finished product yet although he is very good but we desperately need a defender that can sort out everything.
reddevils,3dlxmc,Marshmallow_Fluff,5,Fri Jul 17 10:42:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed, right now experience is what we need in defence."
reddevils,3dlxmc,nubijoe,3,Fri Jul 17 10:44:28 2015 UTC,Otamendi is a complete player and he really wants to play for us. And I don't think we'll end up paying that much for him.
reddevils,3dlxmc,KKlondon86,-3,Fri Jul 17 11:58:27 2015 UTC,"Well he put is in a terrible position, demanding to be transferred. Now more than likely we have to pay his full quote €50 million. Way to much for him IMO."
reddevils,3dlxmc,nubijoe,4,Fri Jul 17 13:04:10 2015 UTC,"Noone is forcing us to anything. He is putting Valencia in a terrible position, because they have a player who openly says he does not want to be there. In the end what will they prefere; getting 0€ and an unhappy player, or getting less than they want (probably 40M€)?  Basically he's the one taking the whole risk with those comments. Not us."
reddevils,3dlxmc,KKlondon86,0,Fri Jul 17 13:08:37 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't do anything at 50. If anything we take it to August 31st and see what Valencia's hand is and Otamendi's for that matter. If he realizes that we may not pay 50, Hey may change his tune real quick. He's a good player but we have his clone already in Rojo."
reddevils,3dlxmc,Xanian123,0,Fri Jul 17 13:27:50 2015 UTC,Phil Jones is a better stylistic comparison to Otamendi.
reddevils,3dlxmc,Feezbull,4,Fri Jul 17 16:15:59 2015 UTC,Don't give a damn what they want honestly. He could turn out good. Or be horrible in the end. We should buy what we need and not to stop other clubs from getting a certain player. Would you want us to stop Liverpool getting firmino? No. Or Benteke? No.   Same thing. I don't get this logic people sometimes have about buying so others can't. It's literally buying for the sake of doing so.
reddevils,3dlxmc,superspyent,3,Fri Jul 17 10:59:49 2015 UTC,"I, for one, wouldn't terribly mind scooping up Benteke from right under Liverpool. He's proven in the Premier League, with a shit side even, and the price they're paying for him isn't bad.  I do agree with your point on Stones, however. We have plenty of young talent at CB, what we need is a finished product. Smalling is still young for CB at 25 and Phil Jones is only 23, which is easy to forget."
reddevils,3dlxmc,oolalaa,2,Fri Jul 17 17:36:16 2015 UTC,He's worth whatever Bayern paid for Benatia.
reddevils,3dlxmc,rogues69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:41 2015 UTC,We have enough young defenders with potential of our own. We need to get bit of leadership and experience in the back line
reddevils,3dlxmc,Feezbull,4,Fri Jul 17 14:58:16 2015 UTC,Just how reliable is plaza deportiva though? I've not heard of them so maybe someone who has a clue can shed some light? Thanks.
reddevils,3dlxmc,as520,2,Fri Jul 17 10:23:40 2015 UTC,"From what I've googled, they are a local newspaper in Valencia, they tend to given reliable information on Valencia CF. Gotten stories right and wrong. But have maintained that Valencia wants 50 million euros for Otamendi for a month or so."
reddevils,3dlxmc,rogues69,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:30:58 2015 UTC,Everyone's maintained that
reddevils,3dlxmc,GrayOctopus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:00:07 2015 UTC,"reading through  Jonas Giæver's comments, there is a slight concern with reliability because of a supposed staff change up at the paper, however he said he consulted someone about their reliability and thought they were good enough to post even with that concern."
reddevils,3dlxmc,buddhabrax,4,Fri Jul 17 10:33:59 2015 UTC,Rojo had a chat with him.
reddevils,3dlxmc,Feezbull,4,Fri Jul 17 11:36:07 2015 UTC,If Otamendi really wants to be here that bad why are we even bothering with Ramos?
reddevils,3dlxmc,6stringsoldier,9,Fri Jul 17 11:42:20 2015 UTC,"Because Ramos is a better fit overall as a ball playing CB especially so and also a very, very good player."
reddevils,3dlxmc,feedmesc,3,Fri Jul 17 12:13:30 2015 UTC,I still think the Ramos saga is a big contract boost effort by him
reddevils,3dlxmc,rogues69,3,Fri Jul 17 11:50:48 2015 UTC,Leadership and an experienced winner is what we need at the back Otamendi is an awesome player  but I'd take Ramos over him any day
reddevils,3dlxmc,holden147,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:16:01 2015 UTC,Because Ramos' brother/agent has probably told MUFC that he is interested in the move like he directly told Hunter and Sid Lowe and Woodward is exploiting this to get leverage in the De Gea saga.
reddevils,3dlxmc,TweetPoster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:31:58 2015 UTC,Because Madrid is bothering with DDG.
reddevils,3dlxmc,LedgeySC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:00:40 2015 UTC,I think we should go for both. Smalling had a good season but it's just one season. What if he gets hurt? Then we are relying on Rojo/Jones to be fit for every competition we have. I would buy Otamendi regardless of whether or not we get Ramos since he is much better than any CB we currently have.

reddevils,3dlxmc,dbelle92,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:52:46 2015 UTC,Have we actually put forward any interest for him? It seems clear that he does want to join us but I've not heard anything of us considering a bid and anything that does crop up seems to be paper-talk.  Saying that I'd like him here.

reddevils,3dlxmc,RiemsMUFC,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:57:00 2015 UTC,Does this mean that we aren't going for Ramos?
reddevils,3dlxmc,kyro7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:50:02 2015 UTC,"I don't see why not, it'd be better than relying on Rojo/Jones to stay fit if Smalling gets hurt and vice versa.  However, if we can only have one then I'd say we should stick with trying to grab Ramos."
reddevils,3dlxmc,cloudbreaker81,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:49:49 2015 UTC,"He's on holiday for another week I think. At least that's what's going around the most reliable sources on Twitter (meaning nothing to do with the Mail, Sport, Telegraph, Indy).    Not worried about this one at all. I think it will happen very soon."
reddevils,3dnoyh,AirborneAquarium1,14,Fri Jul 17 19:24:22 2015 UTC,"I've had MUTV since last pre season so i'll give you my opinion on it.  Benefits   Full match replays the day after the match. This is great when the match isnt on TV. The matches also feature more interviews than you'd see on sky. (Plus they show all pre match games live!) Live U21 and U18 games are also good to watch. They often break them down into 30 minute highlights which is even better United archives. A 30 minute programme of past notable games ranging from the 90s up until last season. Probably my favourite programme they air. The documentaries are second to none. They also have in depth interviews with past and present players. Live pres conferences which show more than Sky and Youtube do, aswell as this they also have weekly interviews with the players discussing the game.   Negatives   The presenters are very very dull and they seem to choose the most washed up ex players possible. The commentators are also incredibly biased but thats expected. The weekly call in shows are just pure cringe. The set is so outdated, the people that call in are also the most deluded you will find. Paddy Crerand one of the hosts is also stuck in the past, sometimes he can be funny but most of the time he comes across as a bit odd."
reddevils,3dnoyh,DatGuyRich,10,Fri Jul 17 19:42:04 2015 UTC,I have no idea why this sub loves Paddy on MUTV so much..
reddevils,3dnoyh,YourLocalVintner,7,Fri Jul 17 19:44:15 2015 UTC,"He just reminds people of their granddads, I think."
reddevils,3dnoyh,Hassi94,3,Fri Jul 17 20:39:09 2015 UTC,Really? Last pre-season this sub was full of hate for him and his commentary.
reddevils,3dnoyh,ausnick2001,2,Fri Jul 17 21:26:17 2015 UTC,"I only joined this sub after the preseason so I didn't see, whenever it was announced he wouldn't be commentating this year everyone was devastated apart from a couple."

reddevils,3dnoyh,ausnick2001,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:09:30 2015 UTC,What does he exactly contribute?
reddevils,3dnoyh,TheJoshider10,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:22:00 2015 UTC,There was a really good mitten article which went into detail about it. He's quite chummy with the players so he organises interviews and he's generally very popular around the camp.  Edit: here you go http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-paddy-crerand-missed-9565203
reddevils,3dnoyh,ausnick2001,2,Sat Jul 18 07:48:23 2015 UTC,"Thank you. I'm more interested in the behind the scenes footage and player interviews than anything else. The archive also sounds really interesting.   And I love Paddy lol  If you take what he says with a (sometimes massive) grain of salt, he's just hilarious."
reddevils,3dnoyh,wharsmetoothpicson,2,Fri Jul 17 19:44:58 2015 UTC,'the most washed up ex players' - well there's respect. Paddy is a legend and he does what he wants.
reddevils,3dnoyh,ohyou123,22,Fri Jul 17 23:56:45 2015 UTC,"It's decent if you want some behind-the-scenes exclusive interviews or friendly matches but they end up on YouTube for free regardless.  One thing I don't like is the inherent bias that it espouses. Even though I'm a United fan I don't want to be filled full of crap and only told the club's official version of how certain events went down. I like to get both sides particularly when a club player is concerned.  For example, Roy Keane gave an interview for MUTV back in the day where he stated that there were players in that dressing room that didn't deserve to be within one hundred miles of a Manchester United jersey so the club didn't air it. I think it's important to know what players the club captain thinks is shit, don't you?"
reddevils,3dnoyh,gosha1988,18,Fri Jul 17 19:33:00 2015 UTC,The club didn't air it because SAF didn't allow it. I would love to watch the interview though
reddevils,3dnoyh,ausnick2001,17,Fri Jul 17 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"Also he wasn't saying that as a pundit, he was saying that as a current player. He also made a lot of personal slurs against our players (like criticising Rio about the amount of money he made, saying that Fletcher was a waste of time). Scrapping the interview wasn't bias, it was avoiding a PR disaster."
reddevils,3dnoyh,omegaxLoL,3,Fri Jul 17 21:24:23 2015 UTC,"I got it here in Portugal since last year, so I don't know if the programming shown here is different than on the UK, but I generally like it. Allows me to watch U21 games more regularly, for example. I like the Archive games, player goals compilations, documentaries with former/present players and it's great to watch the press conferences, especially with a manager as entertaining as Van Gaal."
reddevils,3dnoyh,beirch,2,Fri Jul 17 20:33:59 2015 UTC,"TV2 in Norway has a net based TV called TV2 Sumo. You get MUTV and Real Madrid's TV channel included in the price.   You also get a ton of norwegian sports related channels. These are all obviously broadcasted in Norwegian, but around 50% of PL matches are broadcasted with english commentary.  Almost all Championship matches have english commentary iirc.  It's £29 a month, but I don't know the price of MUTV directly from MUFC so it might not be worth it at all. Might be more expensive.  Also, you'll have to use a VPN.  Just posting as a suggestion. If the price is ~same you'll have MUTV, RMTV + 50+ matches a year with english commentary."

reddevils,3dlxr1,Roumen,28,Fri Jul 17 15:05:39 2015 UTC,"I think his comment about the state in which he received the club was ""astonishing"" is very telling of how we let a lot of things fall by the wayside over the last few years. Our previous investments in youth didn't really pan out (yet), our academy has been stagnant for the last decade, and we were performing poorly in Europe. Yes we made the final thrice in four years, but only won once, and lost both times to a dominant Barcelona side.    Woody has more than just transfers to worry about. He needs to look at the entire structure of the club, everything from the youth academy to the kitchen staff. United can truly become the best club in the world by positioning itself as having the best training facilities, best medical team, best youth academy, best chips, and of course the best squad assembled, which will be a combination of foreign talent and youth. I hope he can do it"
reddevils,3dlxr1,kingfishers_nest,34,Fri Jul 17 13:12:59 2015 UTC,"the best chips    Let's be honest, this is the real key to success"

reddevils,3dlxr1,Motecuhzoma,2,Fri Jul 17 14:27:50 2015 UTC,I will never buy chips inside old Trafford. It would be like £3 a chip and they'd be shit unlike the vast empire of fish and chip stalls outside the ground.
reddevils,3dlxr1,JMunn21,20,Fri Jul 17 16:17:01 2015 UTC,"Losing in finals to a team with the best player in history, one of the best teams ever assembled, is not ""performing poorly in Europe"". If that's your ""poor"" you're going to be very disappointed for the next few years."
reddevils,3dlxr1,honey_pie,6,Fri Jul 17 14:46:34 2015 UTC,"Losing isn't what I had a problem with. It was the fact that we went into both finals as the undisputed underdogs. Add to the fact that our run to the final was ""easier"" than our opponent's and you can't argue against the fact that we didn't improve when others did. That's all I'm saying. Yes Barca were the better team, but we should have done something about it between 2009-2011.    EDIT: added some words for clarity"
reddevils,3dlxr1,kingfishers_nest,6,Fri Jul 17 15:33:50 2015 UTC,"Not sure why are you getting down voted here, clearly this is true even if the remainder of his state of the club points are correct.  :/"
reddevils,3dlxr1,Mekkah,6,Fri Jul 17 15:16:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah the rest of his points were pretty spot on, but we definitely weren't performing poorly in Europe. In the past decade we've reached the final 3 times, winning once. Only Barca have a better record than that, and they debatably had the best ever team and best ever player during that time period. They also beat us in the two finals  Just for the record this is how other teams stack up in CL finals since 2005.

Last season it all came together and he was consistently excellent on a level he never was on in the Portuguese league. Could be that La Liga suits him better or that he's genuinely improved at Valencia, remains to be seen but I firmly don't think he's a one season wonder with his performances year long for Argentina and Valencia and if he can replicate his performances of last season, he's worth the 50 Million euro clause."

reddevils,3dno80,BrendonAG92,2,Fri Jul 17 21:09:55 2015 UTC,so he's a either a) a one season wonder or b) it all has finally clicked and he will be a great from now on.   Got it.
reddevils,3dno80,vidman33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:46:58 2015 UTC,Nothing more than solid I believe.
reddevils,3dno80,kharma45,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:21:00 2015 UTC,"I've only watched Otamendi briefly in the in the Copa Americas, but from what I've seen and read I'm not certain he is a significant step up from Jones/Smalling/Rojo. I think he is in that class/tier as a player. Now that may be the best available on the market this summer (assuming Ramos just wants a contract with Real), but I don't know if he is this game changer that will hold down our defense for the next half decade. Still might be worth bringing in though if we're selling Evans and aren't confident that McNair/Blackett could be that 4th CB for us."
reddevils,3dno80,BBQ_HaX0r,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:51:07 2015 UTC,"From what I saw in the Copa America, he wasn't at his usual best. He was much better at Valencia. Not many Argentines were playing to their best at the Copa."
reddevils,3dno80,BokiBoki,0,Fri Jul 17 20:26:19 2015 UTC,"I know it's not answering your question, but his stats for the past season are amazing. Better interceptions, clearances, won tackles, aerial duels won and a better overall defence score (all per 90 min) compared to Terry, Godin, S. Ramos and Boateng, where all of them have played at least 27 games, and Otamendi having played 35.  I hope he really is the real deal, and not a one hit wonder if we get him."
reddevils,3dno80,moopoint,-5,Fri Jul 17 21:12:49 2015 UTC,"He would still be world class. What could possibly be the reason for him flopping. He positions himself well to stop strikers getting in behind. The only reason i could think of is homesick and that isnt a major problem, so it is fair to spend upto £30m but not £35m"
reddevils,3dno80,WhatAreThooose,3,Fri Jul 17 19:23:30 2015 UTC,Why is £30m okay but £35m unacceptable?
reddevils,3dno80,maniacaldentist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:31:53 2015 UTC,I dunno i dont want us to pay double his actual value. Ideally my max would be £25 but since valencia know we're rich and asking for full price £30m seems fair
reddevils,3dno80,WhatAreThooose,2,Fri Jul 17 19:39:23 2015 UTC,"What is his actual value though? If Valencia stick a £35m release clause onto him and won't let him go for under it, and we value him highly enough to fork it out for his signature, then surely that's his actual value?  A player is only valued what a club is willing to let him go for."
reddevils,3dno80,maniacaldentist,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:47:33 2015 UTC,"There's no such thing as an ""actual value"" when it comes to athletes. A player is worth what another team will pay for them, and nothing more or less."

reddevils,3dpfet,duckofwolfstreet,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:08:05 2015 UTC,"Depends what aspect of his game really. A player's ""prime"" is a difficult thing to pinpoint because they'll lose speed and agility but gain experience. Players like Pirlo and Scholes were arguably playing their best football when they'd usually be considered past their prime.   Rooney has lost some pace and his style is different but his intelligence and experience leading the front line is exceptional. He's not quite as exhilarating as he once was but his positioning and finishing is world class."

Both near the same age, both have played a major role for club and country (Schweini for Germany a bit bigger role but none the less) both are staple players of their respected leagues (Schweini has a lot to prove, but comes with a lovely background.)  They are both very decorated players who best have a great next three years for MUFC and be the figureheads of winning LvG what he and the all of Manchester United deserve, GLORY!"

Perhaps bring out an all youth team, Giggsy too, let the nurses have a go, and maybe Van Gaal can make an appearance in the second half.   And if needs be give Klay & Kai Rooney a go on the pitch."

reddevils,3dmi35,7evenStrings,8,Fri Jul 17 14:32:28 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Not to forget that he comes with a top billing from almost everyone who regularly watches the Serie A. Quite taken with his personality till now too. Reminds me of a shy Ander.
reddevils,3dmi35,Schneidsteiger,3,Fri Jul 17 14:34:47 2015 UTC,"not a single Italian mate of mine has said a bad thing about us signing him.

The list of Italian and Serie A based players to be shite in England is extremely long and the list who've done really well is pretty damn short, especially since 2000 once the PL caught up to and surpassed Serie A for quality."

reddevils,3dmi35,Takley,15,Fri Jul 17 14:29:43 2015 UTC,Probably his last chance too. If he can't do it this year then he never will.
reddevils,3dmi35,kharma45,12,Fri Jul 17 14:30:42 2015 UTC,"He's done it consistently every time he's been there, he doesn't have to prove anything.."
reddevils,3dmi35,giblets24,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:14:45 2015 UTC,4-5 seasons ago I'd have agreed.
reddevils,3dmi35,kharma45,3,Fri Jul 17 16:37:58 2015 UTC,You forget when he scored like 26 goals or or something 3 seasons ago? He was also our top scorer last season which is decent when he played a lot of games behind the striker.
reddevils,3dmi35,Zandercy42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:26:32 2015 UTC,Yes that and the 09/10 season.
reddevils,3dmi35,kharma45,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:27 2015 UTC,..so I don't get your point.
reddevils,3dmi35,Zandercy42,-4,Fri Jul 17 17:35:11 2015 UTC,It's two out of... 10 or 11 seasons. He doesn't do it often. They're the only years you could say he was a top class striker.
reddevils,3dmi35,kharma45,2,Fri Jul 17 17:39:53 2015 UTC,"You won't fully understand football or the ability of players if you base your opinions on statistics though, he's always been lethal and has always played a huge part in the team whether it's by scoring goals or helping the attack."
reddevils,3dmi35,Zandercy42,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:45:50 2015 UTC,"I fully agree, statistics are very misleading at times. Rooney though is not someone I'd call lethal, not now. He's been poor for a while and somehow escapes criticism."
reddevils,3dmi35,kharma45,2,Fri Jul 17 18:03:58 2015 UTC,"Every time he's played up front he's performed well...it's not his fault that he was played in midfield, you said if he can't do it this season he never will...excluding the fact he repeatedly has"
reddevils,3dmi35,giblets24,0,Fri Jul 17 17:09:16 2015 UTC,"He had one outstanding season up front, beyond that, he's been middling to good. To say he's performed well every time he's up front is laughable."
reddevils,3dmi35,kharma45,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:16:35 2015 UTC,I know you're thinking of that  09/10 season as his 'one good' season up front..but he scored more goals in the year City won the league in the last minute... middling to good strikers don't score as much as him...don't forget he's very rarely actually been given a full season as striker
reddevils,3dmi35,giblets24,0,Fri Jul 17 17:23:26 2015 UTC,What? He played there for 14 games last season and scored 4 goals. I don't think that counts as 'doing it'.
reddevils,3dmi35,JuanRiquelme,2,Fri Jul 17 19:40:55 2015 UTC,If he can't do it this year do you think he'll be sold?
reddevils,3dmi35,StannisJr,3,Fri Jul 17 14:32:40 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll sell him until he's 35 and ready to sign for an MLS team or something. I can't see him fitting in at any other PL side unless he drops off significantly and goes back to Everton, and I very much doubt he'll go to Europe now, if he was to go he would have gone earlier. Can't see LvG casting him aside either."
reddevils,3dmi35,Kilaskwiral,5,Fri Jul 17 14:59:59 2015 UTC,"True, he is our captain after all. I just hope with the service he should get he'll be scoring for fun again!"
reddevils,3dmi35,StannisJr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:10:14 2015 UTC,If he doesn't do it this season LVG will sell him IMO. He's been extremely ruthless so far just look at RVP.  His contract might be a stumbling block but we'd probably just make up the difference anyway and let another club pay 100-150k of it. That happens all the time anyway and there's a very good chance we're doing it with the RVP and Nani deals.
reddevils,3dmi35,JuanRiquelme,0,Fri Jul 17 19:43:13 2015 UTC,Never say never. I didn't even envisage RVP being cast aside by LVG.
reddevils,3dmi35,kharma45,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:14:04 2015 UTC,Don't think he has anything to prove. People who know their shit know that he is a world Class player. You can't become the all time top scorer in the teams like Manchester United and England(he will be soon) being 'just good'.
reddevils,3dmi35,chutzpahisaword,11,Fri Jul 17 17:07:59 2015 UTC,I am looking forward to see Luke Shaw improving next season
reddevils,3dmi35,Blackinkcartridge,4,Fri Jul 17 14:28:59 2015 UTC,All I want from him is to stay healthy.
reddevils,3dmi35,pucykoks,12,Fri Jul 17 19:36:42 2015 UTC,Herrera. With our new midfield I feel that he can really flourish
reddevils,3dmi35,nubijoe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:26:11 2015 UTC,"I think there's a decent chance LVG is going to cast him aside a bit.  He seemed to really, really love what Fellaini brought to the side and with no one else offering it including our new midfielders I think he'll start more than people think.  Then there's Carrick/Schweinsteiger/Schneiderlin/Blind and maybe Mata all in there too. Carrick started basically 100% of the time he was fit last season, why would people assume he'll be dropped now while Herrera (who was regularly dropped/rotated when fit) will be a shoe in?  I'm not 100% certain LVG has full faith in Herrera. The fact he signed two midfielders who play in his position this summer suggests to me he might play less than people think."
reddevils,3dmi35,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:46:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think he will be a shoe in, but i think once Herrera got more comfortable with the ""philosophy"" he was much more of a mainstay in the side. I think Herrera said that he wasn't playing because he hadn't adapted to the LVG playing style yet, but it seemed like once he got back into the side he had a pretty consistent run of games.   I don't know if there is a site that you can see what games a specific player played in, but I feel like he was selected pretty regularly in the second half of the season. I believe he started in half the games across the entire league schedule, and scored a few goals for us, so I think LVG will have faith in him this season, despite the competition for his place."
reddevils,3dmi35,caknyoi,13,Fri Jul 17 20:41:59 2015 UTC,I'm excited to watch Memphis Depay and Di Maria (I hope he stays!)
reddevils,3dmi35,edmontom,19,Fri Jul 17 14:15:12 2015 UTC,I guess I'm the only one who wants to see Morgan the most
reddevils,3dmi35,antantoon,3,Fri Jul 17 14:32:28 2015 UTC,"nope, he's the one I want to see the most too"
reddevils,3dmi35,RiemsMUFC,3,Fri Jul 17 14:39:27 2015 UTC,"I have the highest (long-term) expectations and the most trepidation about his signing. We really need a dominant midfielder for the long-term, and I really hope he can step up to this level and come good. So yes, he's the one I'm most interested in watching as well. Schweinsteiger will do well in a limited number of games, Darmian will slot right into the RB position, and I think Memphis will struggle with the league this year..."
reddevils,3dmi35,WRCousCous,7,Fri Jul 17 15:44:30 2015 UTC,"Di Maria. I think the pressure is going to be off him this year with a pretty well set team around him, so he can go and do what he does best, be completely unpredictable.   I might be setting myself up for disappointment if he gets sold though."
reddevils,3dmi35,ratherinquisitive,5,Fri Jul 17 15:01:24 2015 UTC,I really think Rooney will have a fantastic season. We have added quality and depth to the midfield and wings. This new quality added will surely offer good service for Rooney to be a 20 goal striker this season.
reddevils,3dmi35,silkie_blondo,13,Fri Jul 17 14:26:08 2015 UTC,"A full season of quality Di Maria (assuming he stays, I think he will make a push towards being one of the best to ever wear the number 7)  Depay (such speed up front and that killer instinct- mmmmm yes)  Wilson (breaking out of his shell and really start becoming a classy footballer)  Januzaj (He wont be first choice but with more games and a firing desire to play, I think that he will push through and play on either of the wings or in an attacking midfield roll- definitely a super sub quality for the final 40 minutes to start the season.  I just want him to come good after such a fantastic season 2 years ago."
reddevils,3dmi35,uncreddevil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:21:06 2015 UTC,"A full season of quality Di Maria (assuming he stays, I think he will make a push towards being one of the best to ever wear the number 7)   What a load of rubbish.  Best, Cantona, Robson, Ronaldo and Beckham wore that shirt.  Steve Coppell was a great servant for years too.  Unless you consider being ""one of the best"" to be making the top 10 then ADM has no chance of achieving anything like that this season."
reddevils,3dmi35,JuanRiquelme,0,Fri Jul 17 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"I am well aware of the fantastic players to have donned the #7 kit.  But if he sticks around for 4-5 years in his prime, he has the ability to be up there and be our generations Cantona should he stick around.  They came in at the same age, both are wizards with the ball, and Eric did not perform exceedingly well his first year at Man U.  With enough time he COULD become a top 5/6 #7 for Manchester United should he have the passion and desire to do so.  He has it in him and to not realize that would be a load of rubbish."
reddevils,3dmi35,uncreddevil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:04:12 2015 UTC,"Cantona had character, Di Maria simply doesn't have it. I'd rarely see Cantona go missing in a game the way Di Maria did last season."
reddevils,3dmi35,wharsmetoothpicson,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:41:01 2015 UTC,He really is nowhere near Cantona. He's never shown anything like the ability to be a teams talisman like that. You're massively overrating him
reddevils,3dmi35,JuanRiquelme,2,Fri Jul 17 21:36:24 2015 UTC,"It's not any one individual player, but the combination of Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin and Hererra.  Oh that midfield would make anyone shit their pants.   With Angel Di Maria, Depay and Wilson/ Rooney in front of these 3,  we would be bloody unstoppable!"

reddevils,3dmi35,StannisJr,2,Fri Jul 17 14:42:15 2015 UTC,Definitely Luke Shaw. He adds a whole new dimension to the team when he's fit.
reddevils,3dmi35,Syri0Forel,2,Fri Jul 17 14:42:41 2015 UTC,From the new signings: Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger. Want to see our midfield working well.  From the ones who were already here: I'm really curious to watch Rooney with our new midfield behind him.
reddevils,3dmi35,omegaxLoL,2,Fri Jul 17 15:22:52 2015 UTC,"Along with the new signings and Rooney playing up front Im going to have to say:  Luke Shaw, I firmly believe if he is fit for the full season he could easily be a huge factor in our success this season. For me knowing he will have a full pre season and will be fully fit by the Spurs game is like having a new signing, I always felt when he played at times last season he was fantastic and showed a lot of maturity for his age and now being at the club for a year and having listening to LVG and also the other senior players he knows the standard of a UTD Player. We have always played with attacking fullbacks and he has shown he has the potential to be the best hopefully we can see that this year and we wont ever have to hear that he wasnt worth the 29Mil we paid."

reddevils,3dmaac,StaleMilkNothingTher,12,Fri Jul 17 12:39:31 2015 UTC,Hopefully we can get Otamendi tied up quick!
reddevils,3dmaac,lukejames1111,9,Fri Jul 17 12:43:29 2015 UTC,Maybe it's an unpopular opinion but I feel like Otamendi would be more suited to the PL than Ramos.  I haven't seen either of them play every game last season but from what I've seen of Otamendi he has a physical side to his game and I think that would really help us. It's also nice that him and Rojo have played together before.
reddevils,3dmaac,7evenStrings,6,Fri Jul 17 14:36:55 2015 UTC,"Ramos is well capable of withstanding the physical side of things, but he would also give us the ball playing skills we badly need."
reddevils,3dmaac,mink_man,3,Fri Jul 17 15:15:37 2015 UTC,Assuming Ramos isn't physical?
reddevils,3dmaac,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:26:40 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying this is more prominent element to Otamendi's game and a category in which he's better than Ramos. This element of his game makes him better suited to the PL and also something that's missing from our back four."
reddevils,3dmaac,7evenStrings,5,Fri Jul 17 16:49:54 2015 UTC,Totally disagree. Ramos is better in the air and in speed. Combine that with technical skills that aren't even close to rivaled by any CB in the league means Ramos would comfortably be the better fit.
reddevils,3dmaac,HuzaifaElahi,-5,Fri Jul 17 16:51:21 2015 UTC,Both is a possibility
reddevils,3dmaac,Panda12341234,10,Fri Jul 17 12:45:47 2015 UTC,We likely would only sign one anyway because there's no way we renew the contracts of both Smalling and Jones with the knowledge that we might bring in 2 starting CBs. It doesn't make sense and neither would want to be a double back up along with Rojo as well. One or possibly both might leave if this is the case.
reddevils,3dmaac,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:50:45 2015 UTC,"Well Evans is likely leaving, so we'll have 4 higher quality CB's now. Also Mcnair too, not really sure on Blackett though."
reddevils,3dmaac,StannisJr,-7,Fri Jul 17 13:05:05 2015 UTC,Darmien. Valencia .   Rojo.  Shaw.    Ramos.  Jones.    Otamendi.   Smalling  It would be perfect
reddevils,3dmaac,Panda12341234,7,Fri Jul 17 12:53:26 2015 UTC,You need to stop playing Football Manager. No way that should be allowed to happen.
reddevils,3dmaac,A_hiccup,-9,Fri Jul 17 12:55:04 2015 UTC,"Why? There is four competition  Five CB, for two places is fine , ideal  Rojo is also capable of covering left back  Blind is best in the midfield"
reddevils,3dmaac,Panda12341234,4,Fri Jul 17 12:59:08 2015 UTC,"Competition for what?  No matter how far we progress, we will play less than 70 games this season. If our assumption is 3 out of 5 of those CBs are fit all of the time, and that's excluding McNair, then one of the CBs will get benched or be dropped. It can be Smalling(not possible as we need him to develop more). It can't be Otamendi or Ramos. That leaves Phil Jones, who if allowed to develop, and has an injury free season, can only get better.   Sorry, but I would hate it if we went and bought 2 CBS, when 1 CB and 1 striker should conclude our window. Pointless depth won't get us anywhere and would alienate and frustrate the players we currently have."
reddevils,3dmaac,A_hiccup,-13,Fri Jul 17 13:03:41 2015 UTC,Competition breeds success  Smalling is overrated IMO
reddevils,3dmaac,Panda12341234,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:06:57 2015 UTC,It's fine yes. But LVG doesn't rotate much actually. And we don't have 100 games to warrant that either. 3 would constantly be benched and definitely won't be happy after awhile and then seek a move. We also have a very capable youth player in McNair as a CB.
reddevils,3dmaac,Feezbull,-1,Fri Jul 17 13:28:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind if one of the two didn't come and we use McNair or Blackett
reddevils,3dmaac,6stringsoldier,-5,Fri Jul 17 12:59:29 2015 UTC,I agree  But I think LVG whats to go nuts
reddevils,3dmaac,Panda12341234,29,Fri Jul 17 13:04:32 2015 UTC,"just an article with benitez' quotes. Unless Ramos said he's not leaving Madrid or sign a new contract, there's still a possibility that he will join us."
reddevils,3dmaac,prehighcrap,5,Fri Jul 17 13:00:12 2015 UTC,LVG himself said it was rubbish so there is that.
reddevils,3dmaac,Finzzz,6,Fri Jul 17 14:06:07 2015 UTC,He didn't specify what is rubbish.
reddevils,3dmaac,ReaperX24,3,Fri Jul 17 15:27:24 2015 UTC,"Boy, we're really clutching at straws here aren't we."
reddevils,3dmaac,TheFormidableGiant,2,Fri Jul 17 15:56:18 2015 UTC,"Not really. He was asked about Cavani, Lewandowski, and Ramos. Out of the three, Ramos is the only one that has been reported by a reliable source, and not just one.  Ramos is probably staying in Madrid, but the stories are not rubbish, there is obviously something to them. It's more likely that the Cavani/Lewandowski link is what made him have a go at the journalists, because those are completely unfounded. Lewandowski was referred to as 'LvG's #1 target for the striker position' by one of the Journos (Ogden?), when Rummenigge said just a few days ago that there will be no more players leaving Bayern for United this summer. I think that's why LvG was so furious."
reddevils,3dmaac,ReaperX24,6,Fri Jul 17 16:07:15 2015 UTC,I am perfectly fine not paying 40 million for Ramos.
reddevils,3dmaac,cartoon_soldier,2,Fri Jul 17 14:31:26 2015 UTC,"I've never understood the idea, either. He's very error-prone, and United would be paying £40m for someone who wouldn't be the best centre-back in the league. Otamendi is the more sensible option."
reddevils,3dmaac,HuzaifaElahi,6,Fri Jul 17 15:11:58 2015 UTC,"Like Otamendi would be the best in the league? Ramos' ball playing ability is unmatched - he fits our system to absolute perfection on paper, easily more than Ota."
reddevils,3dmaac,RiemsMUFC,3,Fri Jul 17 16:28:36 2015 UTC,"Madrid reportedly want €90M for him. These are tactics the manager uses to drive up his value and get a club to pay. The same can be said for how LVG addresses the media regarding De Gea and Di Maria.   That being said, €90M is roughly £60M, and that's absurd to pay for a defender. Even the £40M that is being rumored to be our last offer is bit much."
reddevils,3dmaac,gladiator91,3,Fri Jul 17 14:50:33 2015 UTC,well not a surprise this one
reddevils,3dmaac,januzaj_44,2,Fri Jul 17 12:46:28 2015 UTC,It turns out Sergio 'I'm not using you for a contract' Ramos might have been using us for a contract.  Who would've guessed?
reddevils,3dmaac,Ihatenetbackup,2,Fri Jul 17 15:13:48 2015 UTC,"Honestly this will drag on for a while. If I was Ed Woodward and I seriously wanted Ramos over everything I would call up Perez and say:  ""Sell me Ramos or De Gea gets it.""  and Perez responds:  ""Gets whats?""  Then in the smuggest voice possible.. ""Champions League Cup tied thats what..BITCH"""
reddevils,3dmaac,ReflectingGod,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:29:16 2015 UTC,"Say he really does want out, feels like he has been ""disrespected"" and the club won't meet his wage demands like whats been reported. Surely it would make more sense to let him go for a large sum than keep him against his desires as he is more likely to give a poor and unmotivated return in this upcoming season. Wasn't there a poll recently in which it found most Madrid fans wanted him out? Surely out of respect for the player you'd let them go aha  I think we may one day see Ramos in a United shirt. To my understanding he only has 2 seasons left on his contract and if he really wants out, he won't be signing another so RM may decide wise to cash out on him next season as they'd still be looking at a good £20m for him at least."
reddevils,3dmaac,StannisJr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:12:44 2015 UTC,If we get Otamendi we won't be needing a CB for a few years.
reddevils,3dmaac,ReflectingGod,3,Fri Jul 17 13:14:54 2015 UTC,"I think Ramos will have a bigger long term impact though. He is a winner and a world class CB that could easily play at the top level for another 6 years. Otamendi improves our defense massively but Ramos takes our team to a new level. We have few ""winners"" in our team and as good as Otamendi is, he isn't a winner nor is he a leader. We need to get this winning mentality back that we had under Fergie and buying players like Schweinsteiger and Ramos is a step in the right direction. The more we win in the next couple years, the better future we're going to have I guess.  Otamendi is a must sign this window but Ramos would be an incredible signing and we'd be silly to turn him down if given the ability to sign him. He'd take us from title contenders to title winners."
reddevils,3dmaac,StannisJr,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:20:41 2015 UTC,"Of course Ramos is better, and he would take our team up to a higher level than Otamendi, he's a natural leader etc. I'd take Ramos over Otamendi of course, but it seems unlikely. He'll likely sign a new contract with improved wages, he's now the captain of RM, (maybe Casillas was sold to keep Ramos happy?) and then he'll have no reason to leave. At best it's wishful thinking, by thinking he'll join.  I'd rather we just move onto more realistic targets if we're still thinking we can get Ramos, and get Otamendi before Chelsea or another team try and get him."

reddevils,3dmaac,Atlascantakeit,0,Fri Jul 17 18:43:31 2015 UTC,"A blessing in disguise. Otamendi is younger, less temperamental and United would be a step up for him in what could be his last big contract."

No doubt we have more fans across the world but in terms of on the field success (i.e what actually matters) Bayern are the more successful club historically.   player pull as well.   Neither of us have ever been clubs to make massive international signings.   We're both clubs with the same player pull who mostly just buy the best players from other clubs in our league, bring through academy players and sign players from the smaller leagues (Holland, Portugal).  Neither of us have ever been the kind of sign Balon D'or challenging candidates in their prime.  I don't see how you can claim we have historical a bigger pull than Bayern.

reddevils,3dkwfk,Indydegrees2,3,Fri Jul 17 13:47:02 2015 UTC,This house is fairly small but in a great family neighborhood with a good sized yard. It's a quick bike ride from the downtown area and has shops within walking distance. Houses like this in the neighborhood sell in the low to mid 200k.
reddevils,3dkwfk,plus1internets,3,Fri Jul 17 16:42:42 2015 UTC,"Sounds pretty decent to me!   Great family neighbourhood, close to town and a reasonable sized house would be much more expensive in the UK. We're talking somewhere between £300-500k, and in London (and some other major English cities) it'd be in the millions of pounds.   There's a bit of an affordability crisis in the UK with regards to house buying, it's not just English footballers that are expensive! ;)"

If Real Madrid's offers were really as low as they were reported (not even making a profit on him), then I'd prefer him to stay another season. If we were to get Ramos in the deal (doubt it), I'd want him to go right this summer."
reddevils,3dn868,omegaxLoL,4,Fri Jul 17 17:29:54 2015 UTC,I think having a season to line up a keeper without the uncertainty will be handy too

reddevils,3dn868,gosha1988,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:25:28 2015 UTC,"Exactly. This is not a simple yes or no situation. It comes down to terms. There comes a point where the money they offer makes it a good deal for us.   It seems as though they are using his contract situation to low ball us. Losing his talent for an important season isn't worth it for a shit fee, that's why we're after Ramos. I think we want to sell De Gea if we can agree terms which benefit the club long term but at the moment we haven't negotiated those terms."
reddevils,3dn868,digitag,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:48:44 2015 UTC,"The problem is that DDG leaving next year suits Real Madrid down to the ground.  He'll waltz out of Old Trafford on a free transfer and into the arms of that bastard, Perez.  If DDG really want to play for Real Madrid, we should try and get what we can for him now whilst he is still under contract with us."
reddevils,3dn868,ohyou123,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say a total win, but It's good to see us not giving into Madrid. We still get to keep de gea for another season which may prove vital.   I also like this sort of pay the amount we ask or fuck you attitude we gave Madrid."

reddevils,3dn868,kharma45,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"The way I see it is we're a much stronger team with De Gea in goal. The defence and team as a whole are more confident going forward too as they know DDG has their back. As a result, I think we'll go further in the league and cups with DDG which makes him staying worth it."
reddevils,3dn868,generalquarter,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:35:44 2015 UTC,"Nothing is 100% guaranteed. As long as he stays committed to the club and performing to the levels he's known for, I would be happy as long as he stays here.   And as long as next summer is concerned, I am pretty sure we will win the treble by beating Real Madrid in the finals of CL and DDG will have a change of heart."
reddevils,3dn868,neo1691,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:37:51 2015 UTC,"I know this ruins the premise of it all, but if we keep him one year more a lot of stuff can happen that doesn't make it 100%.. Probably 98%, but I'll take those 2% and run with it."
reddevils,3dn868,nubijoe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:42:36 2015 UTC,"Ultimately, with him wanting to go, I can't see us getting the best out of him next season. Towards the end of last season before the injury his head was completely elsewhere. He wasn't communicating with the players, he wasn't alert to incoming balls and his overall play and awareness was real sloppy. He just looked unmotivated I'm assuming because of the fact a move to Madrid looked imminent.  So given that, I don't see many positives in either situation. But if him leaving this window meant we get Ramos and if we also had a good keeper lined up to quickly replace him, I'd be 100% behind the move as I think that would be the most beneficial scenario for us.  No point keeping an unhappy player"
reddevils,3dn868,ReflectingGod,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:08 2015 UTC,"It would be better for Manchester United to let him leave this summer for a number of reasons. Let me explain;  There is no point in keeping a player against his will. Apart from his performances suffering because his heart simply isn't in it anymore, the guy has already demonstrated that he is keen to move back to Spain by not signing a new contract. Look, this isn't something that started last night - this De Gea to Madrid stuff has been going on for months now and all it would have taken to dampen all the speculation would have been for David to get on Twitter and say he was very happy to stay in Manchester. He hasn't done that. Fine, it's his decision.  But if the player wants to leave 100% then we should get what we can for him NOW before letting Madrid sign him for NOTHING next year. I would rather take the 30m off Real Madrid today than to give them him in 11 months for FREE. With the 30m we can buy Hugo Lloris.  And Lloris is a great keeper too! In fact, he is the only goalkeeper in the Premier League to have pulled off MORE saves than DDG last year. He's a fantastic keeper. AND most importantly, he wants to play for United. He is ACTUALLY a MANCHESTER UNITED FAN. He worshipped Eric Cantona as a child.  No player is bigger than the club. Ronaldo wasn't bigger and neither is DDG. Man United will role on! Get our money and call it a day. Onwards and upwards."
reddevils,3dn868,ohyou123,2,Fri Jul 17 17:50:47 2015 UTC,"Exactly this. People are saying 'keep him want De Gea for another year' and 'it's a fuck you to Madrid' when in fact Madrid have won. They get one of the best keepers in the world for nothing because we were being stubborn, most clubs can do that, we won't lose face by selling him. Besides, people don't realise how awful it will be for the group if a very unhappy player is kept there against his will."
reddevils,3dn868,TheMathsDebater,2,Fri Jul 17 18:30:22 2015 UTC,"They're not going to pay us 30m, so your initial premise is flawed. If you believe that it's better to cash in on their current offer, then that's a valid opinion but you're basing your reasoning on a hypothetical bid that most likely won't occur."
reddevils,3dn868,In_Liberty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:39:21 2015 UTC,In no way do we win with the DDG situation against Madrid because either way they get the player they wanted. However if he stays another year then that is excellent for the club as having him in goals well help us challenge for the title much more effectively than if we didn't have him. So if we won the league this season after keeping him then I would chalk that up to a success for the club.

No they didn't cave and accept a shit fee just to get something for him, but in that scenario he's still walking away, and I have a hard time calling losing a world class player under any circumstances a victory.  Plus if they finish 3rd and lose him for nothing, I doubt too many people here are going to thank DeGea for being professional and giving United one last season."

reddevils,3dn868,peduxe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:27:12 2015 UTC,I think United is going to get the money back if DDG helps us to win the title or go further in the CL. Assuming he's performance is as good as this year.

reddevils,3dn868,nravs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:47:16 2015 UTC,He will earn us more money by staying providing a title and great champions league run than his transfer fee.
reddevils,3dn868,PigPenBlues,0,Fri Jul 17 18:02:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think this can be fully answered by saying yes or no, there's too many variables. If we lost DeGea and got Ramos or a fee of ~£30 million then I'd say that's a win, but if we lose him for the £20 million or less that Real wants to pay then it's a loss and we might as well keep him for a year."
reddevils,3dn868,stevisb77,0,Fri Jul 17 17:37:28 2015 UTC,The only way i can see it being a win is if he continues to perform at the best of his ability and not sulk like a child for the remainder of the season and helps us to win the title. He has developed into one of the best goalkeepers in the world at the biggest club in the world and it hasnt being all rosey either in that time but the fans and Manchester United stood by him and this is how he repays us. He should sign a new contract and we should get what he is worth next season when Madrid come calling again!
reddevils,3dn868,sparta41,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:13 2015 UTC,"I think if he had asked to leave he'd be able to leave maybe? No doubt we'd still try and hardball Madrid but I can't see LVG keeping a player that was unhappy and straight up asking to leave. Imo, Dave loves being at United but would gladly accept the move as a means of being closer to home (and lets not be silly, it is Madrid - huge pull for Spanish players in general). However, if he were to stay another year I think he'd give his absolute all - after all, he doesn't want his value decreasing! :D"
reddevils,3dn868,shawker6,0,Fri Jul 17 17:33:32 2015 UTC,"The same madrid club then ran casillas out!...... how that is a pull for any player is beyond me. Look at the way the treated Bale. There fans are a joke. I think van gaal would like to keep the 3rd best keeper in the world if he could, but it is obvious he wants to go but at the end of the day its up to united to sell as he is still under contract regardless if dea gea is happy or not. But what i am saying is some fans would say he owes nothing to united, i would disagree based on the support he received over the years when he was still developing. Would he have got the same support from madrid? I highly doubt it..... fucking sick of madrid taking our finished products off us.... fair play to woodward and the club for standing there ground on this."

reddevils,3dlwt5,spoofex,2,Fri Jul 17 11:29:29 2015 UTC,"Rocket League is a lot of fun though, probably the most fun I've had this whole year. Between it, Witcher 3 and (hopefully) Fallout 4 it's probably my game of the year (Afterbirth possibly as well, even though it's just an expansion)"
reddevils,3dlwt5,lukejames1111,2,Fri Jul 17 11:39:21 2015 UTC,Did you ever play the version on PS3? SARPBC?
reddevils,3dlwt5,Gradiu5,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:43:30 2015 UTC,"No, I had actually never heard of it until they started promoting Rocket League. I didn't have a PS3 though, so I wouldn't have been able to play it anyway.  I saw some footage on Youtube, and it seemed pretty similar, but with worse graphics and it looked a bit ""clunky"". But it's clear that they continued with the same ideas they had with SARPBC when making Rocket League."
reddevils,3dlwt5,lukejames1111,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:46:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's almost exactly the same gameplay wise. The only thing I can think that is different is that the PS3 version your ""demolition boost"" lasted forever once you reached that speed."
reddevils,3dlwt5,Gradiu5,2,Fri Jul 17 11:55:39 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty excited for the future of Rocket League, when they finally get around to fixing all their server issues, they can start adding more gameplay features.   The community, as usual, has great ideas for stuff they can add. New gamemodes, more cosmetic stuff, more cars, more arenas and tonnes of other stuff."

reddevils,3dlwt5,sup_bruv,2,Fri Jul 17 11:11:56 2015 UTC,I guess you do as ping is everything in these types of games. Also it'll depend on what server you're playing on and how many other people you're playing with.
reddevils,3dlwt5,The_Renovator,1 point,Fri Jul 17 11:17:09 2015 UTC,How bad? I live in the countryside and my phone line might as well be two tin cans with some string between them. It means my internet connection is pretty damn shitty. I can get away with playing it though as long as no one else in the house is doing something like streaming.   As long as your Ping is under 100ms I'd say you'll be alright for it.

We've not got a Michelin starred restaurant but the french, MCR house and Mr Coopers are all very good restaurants.  The bars are great lots of good pubs and cocktail bars.  However, you can't really compare it to Paris or Milan given that Paris and Milan are both capital cities and have the money, retail outlets and restaurants that go with it.

reddevils,3dll3v,Feezbull,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:12:58 2015 UTC,It's only because of Ramos. They would rather keep Ramos indefinitely and wait a year for DDG than get DDG now and lose Ramos. Ed's playing hard ball. We won't have either player next season though :-(
reddevils,3dll3v,littIehobbitses,28,Fri Jul 17 16:43:37 2015 UTC,"Benitez doesn't really have much say though as to whether a player goes or not if Perez decides on that anyway. It's not like they listened to ancelotti about di Maria. Or how they got rid of özil as well in a way. And such.   Not that he's joining but basically, Benitez saying it doesn't mean too much.

Plus I don't really trust Perez's words mainly.   I just hope we either get this done and a new keeper quickly or we get Otamendi and forget about this for the sake of the team and having to settle at the back etc.   We probably will know more after the tour so until then, there'll be more of these unfortunately.

reddevils,3dll3v,GGMU1992,3,Fri Jul 17 07:24:06 2015 UTC,"Manchester United transfer target Sergio Ramos will be staying at Real Madrid, according to new Real manager Rafael Benitez.  United made a £28.6m bid for the Spanish international defender in June, with Sky sources understanding Ramos wanted to leave the Bernabeu and head to Old Trafford.  So far this summer United have bought midfielders Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin, right-back Matteo Darmian and winger Memphis Depay, while offloading Robin van Persie and Nani as part of a major overhaul of the squad.  But it now appears they may miss out on one of their top defensive targets.  Ramos travelled with the Madrid squad for their pre-season tour of Australia and Benitez – who was appointed as successor to Carlo Ancelotti six weeks ago – has now confirmed that the centre-back remains ""an integral part"" of his plans.""In terms of Sergio Ramos, there's a lot of talk about his situation,"" Benitez told reporters in Melbourne.  ""For me, he is an enormous professional. In person, he applies himself, he does everything that the team and I ask of him.  ""And for me, the matter (is that) the president has already commented that he is staying with the club.  ""I have spoken to him at length in the summer about his ideas, about his future. I see Sergio as an integral part of our team, he's a winner and that's what we need in our team."""

Some of the numbers floating around were worrying despite Ramos' prestige.  He's a great defender but at 29 we'll only get a few more years out of him and feel bringing in a younger player who can cement himself into United's history books is the way to go.
reddevils,3dll3v,Pint_Of_Bitter,0,Fri Jul 17 08:36:33 2015 UTC,"Either way it works out, it should be fine with us. If De Gea goes, we get Ramos and Navas. The alternative is that we can keep him for another year and we get Otamendi."

reddevils,3dm9vq,Feezbull,11,Fri Jul 17 12:46:37 2015 UTC,"Idk man. When players from Costa Rica get to prestigious leagues they are heroes back home. With Paulo Wanchope he was an absolute legend for us. Even when Bryan Ruiz went to Fulham it was a huge deal for us and everyone had his jersey. Honestly, the big two teams supported here are Real Madrid and Barca and we even have Barca fans walking around with Keylor's jersey. It's crazy to see a whole country in this muh support of a keeper. For him, he might be happy just being on the team. He's the first Costa Rican player to make it to a team like Real and he is being treated as a hero. Yes, he may prefer to play but he is also living the life right now."
reddevils,3dm9vq,DurdenCommaTyler,3,Fri Jul 17 12:56:07 2015 UTC,"Oh of course,  he might be a hero back home but he's looked at as absolutely dispensable by Madrid and he might have the best goalkeeping performance over a season and still just get casted aside for a big name.

reddevils,3dm9vq,Schneidsteiger,5,Fri Jul 17 14:20:05 2015 UTC,"Kiko and David will be fighting it out for the Spain #1 spot in the Euros next year.   you do realize iker didn't retire, yes? there's a big chance vicente del bosque will still play him as long as he's there, and he can only improve with his move to porto. even if casillas were to be scrapped for the nt, de gea would take up his spot as undisputed #1 until god knows when, there would be no fighting. kiko casilla, about to turn 29, has 1 appearance for spain, his 18-minute debut last year in a friendly. he hasn't been called since (sergio asenjo and rico).   So then why would Kiko Casilla go from being one of the best La Liga keepers in the last 2 years, to warming the bench at RM?   because he was raised by real madrid's youth academy and this is the only chance he'll have to play for real madrid or a club as big as them?"

reddevils,3dm9vq,JGQuintel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:11:15 2015 UTC,This probably means they will sell Keylor Navas next season if they get DDG through a free transfer.DDG will be the 1st choice then and Kiko Casilla will be the back up keeper.
reddevils,3dm9vq,goto_man,-1,Fri Jul 17 15:36:32 2015 UTC,Nah negotations will continue  Real just spend 6m to get the upper hand in negotations
reddevils,3dm9vq,Person0fInterest,7,Fri Jul 17 12:44:33 2015 UTC,"What upper hand? If we aren't keen on getting a low fee, we wouldn't be keen even more so now if they have no need or want for him. We just keep him.   It's Casilla and Navas who are at the short end of it in the end though. The former is a backup now and will still be one. The latter has a ticking clock counting down his days till he gets pushed aside no matter what almost.   Us? We just keep our stance and either keep de gea or get the fee we wanted. If we keep him we know we are not getting a fee next season but that's the premise of things to begin with though."
reddevils,3dm9vq,Feezbull,2,Fri Jul 17 12:49:14 2015 UTC,What? But we don't want to sell him. If they say 'look we have a keeper now anyway we don't need De Gea'. We simply say 'okay then'.

Sounds like something along the lines of:""Rafael also got to play 30 minutes in a desperate attempt to get him a spot, but his communication was as bad when he was a goalkeeper as it was when he plays fullback. """
reddevils,3dneno,mufctez,2,Fri Jul 17 21:25:03 2015 UTC,"I think 22 players will play atleast, 2 completely different teams on both sides of the half"
reddevils,3dneno,Velvet_Revolver,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:05:40 2015 UTC,I wouldn't be surprised to see 1 or 2 players play the full 90. If Van Gaal wants to observe a player in depth he'll give them the full game. He did it with Blackett last year.
reddevils,3dneno,welbzy,2,Fri Jul 17 23:25:23 2015 UTC,Just saw the video LVG interview with MUTV. LVG mentions he will put out 2 teams for the match. One each half so i guess 22 players might play.

reddevils,3dlx71,MadaraTheUchiha,3,Fri Jul 17 11:27:51 2015 UTC,I would but there is no chance he's leaving! I'm pretty sure he's even already stated that this transfer season?
reddevils,3dlx71,peduxe,2,Fri Jul 17 10:06:17 2015 UTC,"Griezmann, Reus or Pedro I think are the best picks. Griezmann and Pedro both have striker experience too but I'd love any of those 3 and just throw money at them"
reddevils,3dlx71,starkador,2,Fri Jul 17 12:40:57 2015 UTC,"Reus has seriously been underwhelming this season, my BVB mate said it. He's still an amazing player, but nowhere near the level he was a few seasons ago."
reddevils,3dlx71,MadaraTheUchiha,5,Fri Jul 17 10:01:30 2015 UTC,Could that be because of the injury?
reddevils,3dlx71,staticxtreme,3,Fri Jul 17 10:02:58 2015 UTC,"Probably, but from what my mate's told me he isn't worth 60mil atm. Feel free to argue with me though."
reddevils,3dlx71,RVCFever,4,Fri Jul 17 10:10:09 2015 UTC,"Injury and the fact Dortmund weren't playing that great might  have been a factor. He is stll wordclass, every top club would like to land him."
reddevils,3dlx71,sid3091,4,Fri Jul 17 12:06:49 2015 UTC,"Reus played just 20 league matches for BVB last season: 7 goals, 5 assists and created 48 chances (more than any other BVB player).  While he may have been 'underwhelming' that is because he was coming back and forth from injury, but was undoubtably their best player when in the team."

reddevils,3dlx71,TomKell,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:55:29 2015 UTC,"Would prefer Greizmann. Reus is a right footed winger who excels on the left flank but we just bought Memphis who also does that. Although Reus does play on the right wing from time to time it's not where he's at his best.   Greizmann is a very similar player to Reus but is left footed, which means he would be perfect for the inverted winger role on the right flank. Cheaper and easier to get too."
reddevils,3dlx71,legojs,3,Fri Jul 17 11:24:40 2015 UTC,How is he cheaper? Atletico paid a pretty penny (30 mil Euros I believe) for him and why would they let him go? He often is used as a striker with them and they lost MM and signed Jackson Martinez so pretty much just replaced what they lost so why would they want to lose another attacker? I feel like both players would be near impossible to get this window.
reddevils,3dlx71,legojs,0,Fri Jul 17 13:23:55 2015 UTC,"I'd love Reus, but I would prefer Griezmann."
reddevils,3dlx71,StannisJr,4,Fri Jul 17 09:53:43 2015 UTC,"Can you explain how Griezmann is better? I haven't seen Griezmann enough, so honestly curious. I've seen him for France only once, didn't seem that special, but that's only one match. Can he dribble or create like Reus? Can he produce a performance like Reus often does against Real or Bayern?"
reddevils,3dlx71,StannisJr,2,Fri Jul 17 09:56:13 2015 UTC,"He got into the BBVA team of the season, so already that's amazing, he's in there with the likes of Ronaldo, Messi, Suarez and he was playing for Atletico who are no where near the likes of Real and Barca in terms of quality players. The same could be said about Dortmund, Reus is similar in the way that he's a world class player, in a sort of average team, obviously they have Hummels too, but Atletico also have Godin. So Atletico and Dortmund are sort of similar. Some could argue that Reus is better and some would say that Griezmann is better but Griezmann has 2 years on Reus and for someone that is arguably better that's great. Reus would probably be a lot more expensive as Griezmanns buy-out clause is £43 million and Reus doesn't have one.   We'll say Griezmann and Reus are on a similar level, Griezmann is not only 2 years younger than Reus, but he would be cheaper too. So he'd be the smarter buy."
reddevils,3dlx71,StannisJr,2,Fri Jul 17 10:24:40 2015 UTC,"The way LVG pays attention to every little detail, he might say Reus is 2 inch taller than Greizmann. :p  But, yes, competing in La Liga ain't easy. So, must be quite good. CFC seem really keen on him though."

reddevils,3dk8h7,profesercheese,20,Thu Jul 16 23:06:05 2015 UTC,Actually could go both ways. I can easily see them giving Navas a shot at number 1. Woodward is clearly not bending over unless we get Ramos.

He was always an Atletico fan, and he was pretty upset about leaving them to join us but decided it was what he had to do for his career.   We always forget the human aspects of players, because we get so wrapped up in the romance of supporting your own club. These international players are here for the reputation, the glory and the money, normally at the expense of sacrifices in their personal lives. De Gea has the opportunity now to have an equally successful career but within his own home town. I think that I'd go to Madrid too."

reddevils,3dk8h7,WillyMorganOnTheWing,2,Fri Jul 17 13:21:03 2015 UTC,"even though I think he'd be stupid as hell   Why? Realistically speaking that is the biggest move a Spaniard can make (not Catalans obviously). Sure you can point to Casillas' exit, but he is a legendary figure largely in part because he was Real Madrid's number 1 goalkeeper. It's no different to an Englishman dreaming of being United's striker. There's a reason Rooney left the club he grew up loving to sign for United. It's the same reason De Gea will end up at Real Madrid."
reddevils,3dk8h7,MstrKurt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:57:24 2015 UTC,"Why? Simply because of the way Casillas has been treated after a whole career of serving them. De Gea will just be a part of business to them, just as Casillas has been made to look.  Put it this way, if I had the talent and United came scouting me, sure I'd turn my head towards it... But if they'd just got rid of someone who dedicated his entire career to them, namely the person I was to replace who was forced out of the club, I'd tell United to fuck off."

reddevils,3dk8h7,WillyMorganOnTheWing,2,Fri Jul 17 18:56:48 2015 UTC,"You do realise that being ""forced out"" inevitably means there will be a falling out? So your challenge is hardly fair. Casillas has hardly been on fantastic terms with the Madrid hierarchy so I don't see the need to play this pointless game. All clubs sell players when they are no longer needed. It's a ruthless business. One day you simply stop being there and have to pack up.  Anyway, literally the last player to leave United (Van Persie) was ruthlessly cut when his value no longer merited his wages."
reddevils,3dk8h7,MstrKurt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:02:48 2015 UTC,"Van Persie was never a club legend, it'd be silly to compare Casillas to Real and RvP to United."

Alex Ferguson ruthlessly got rid of Hughes, Stam (no greater or lesser figure than Van Persie in term of length at the club), Beckham, Keane, van Nistelrooy, Andy Cole etc. It's baffling to suggest otherwise. What do you expect? A parade?"
reddevils,3dk8h7,TreyGrant10,4,Sat Jul 18 09:39:23 2015 UTC,Unfortunately this doesn't mean that De Gea will stay. I assume that Keylor Nevas will leave in the next window.

FWIW, £8million is really good since he only has 1 year left on his deal. He really was poor last season too so the sale suits both us and Evans.  He was a really good defender under Fergie, He really held it down in the 08/09 season when Rio or Vidic was injured and we went 3/4months without conceding a goal. I though he would go on to become a great then. He was really good in 12/13 season too."

reddevils,3dizuu,Fudge-alpaca,5,Thu Jul 16 19:10:35 2015 UTC,It also shows our confidence in how we will obtain an additional Center half.  It might show our trust in the boys coming up (McNair and Blackett) but I think its more proof of what is to come for us.
reddevils,3dizuu,uncreddevil,15,Thu Jul 16 18:25:24 2015 UTC,"I've got high hopes for McNair (and it's nice to hear LvG say he will play at CB instead of RB), but I honestly can't see a first-team future with us for Blackett. With that new contract, he still has plenty of time to impress though, and I'd be pleasantly surprised if he proved me wrong."
reddevils,3dizuu,dannyaray89,23,Thu Jul 16 18:33:43 2015 UTC,"The thing about Blackett is that he has most, if not 95% of the attributes needed, to succeed as a modern defender at the top level. His physique is brilliant, he has a great strike on the ball, can tackle, can win headers and is versatile. He seems to have a laid-back and professional attitude as well. He was fucking fantastic last pre-season and it showed that he has qualities. He just needs to produce against tough opposition when it matters the most; in the league. For many of these young players, it is more about bringing it all together, rather than missing individual pieces of the puzzle. I'd say Blackett is one of those. I remember Rio touching upon this subject a while ago in one of his interviews. How difficult that final step is, to bind together everything one has trained for over a long period of time as a youth player, into a complete picture. The problem has been that we've seen him mostly at left back or thrown into games after being out of the team for weeks or months, not to do too well. He seems to lose focus or not get into the game as quickly as is needed at the Premier League level. He also seems a bit lacking in his positioning similar to Phil Jones. That said, I don't see what there is to lose to give him the chance for us. He's a low risk player for us in that he wants to be here and he is cheap and has a good attitude. Personally, I'd rather we loaned out both McNair and Blackett to teams where they'd get 20+ games this season, keep Evans as a backup (I guess im the only one in here that doesn't hate him), and rotate Rojo, Smalling, Jones, Evans and new CB signing. If we start struggling with injuries, we re-call either McNair or Blackett depending on who's out, preferably in January or earlier than that if need be."
reddevils,3dizuu,rdzzl,2,Thu Jul 16 20:06:54 2015 UTC,"I would be happy with that loan strategy, but it seems LVG likes to mold/incorporate youth players himself rather than loan them out. From what I've seen, he pretty much just loans out those he's not interested in keeping. But you never know.   And as for being the only one who doesn't hate Johnny, I got downvoted in the Ogden article thread for saying I was sad to seem him go. You're not alone bud."
reddevils,3dizuu,dannyaray89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:45:58 2015 UTC,"Frequently rotating 5-6 centrebacks is silly, we need to have a solid back 4 that starts together almost every week (league) for them to know how to work as one solid unit and help the keeper. One or two changes can be made to the back four in domestic cup games but it hurts the chemistry. Other than that I agree with everything else you said."
reddevils,3dizuu,shinkag,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:50:55 2015 UTC,"Frequently rotating 5-6 centrebacks is silly   We either need 5-6 centrebacks available, or to sell Evans, Jones and Smalling.

reddevils,3dizuu,TheAgentInTheEast,2,Thu Jul 16 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"Sometimes a journalist might come to Utd for a comment saying (for argument's sake) we know you've spoken with Otamendi's agent, and I have the quotes to prove it.

There was the Leicester game but he went off injured before that shit went down, was probably a big reason why we capitulated. Then the MK Dons game, which I think I could forgive if LVG did, coming back from injury alongside a bunch of outcasts.  I understand this if we do get a good replacement, but personally I'd like to see McNair and Blackett go out on loan and play 30 games in the PL, like Evans did. Right now we've seen glimpses of good and bad of both, and quite frankly if we're left with one of them in a big CL game we'd be a lot worse off than we would be with Evans."

reddevils,3dizuu,RaisingTheKnife,8,Fri Jul 17 05:50:15 2015 UTC,Evans is very much a confidence player - needs a solid run of games in order to get into a good run of form. Surprised to see alot of fans wanted to get rid of him considering the promise that was around him during his first couple of seasons. He's been a youth product that has been at United his entire career so I'm sad to see him go.  I hope he does well for Everton!
reddevils,3dizuu,SpearBad,11,Thu Jul 16 17:59:03 2015 UTC,"Good luck jonny. Sad to see a academy player go. One bad season and it unfortunately is going to result in departure. I have never hated the man and still believe he is a quality player (still good enough to play for utd quality? YES), he just never took his chance last season. Everton are lucky to have him I feel. And thanks for showing drogba who the boss was at the bridge ;)"
reddevils,3dizuu,Nestledrink,9,Thu Jul 16 17:44:43 2015 UTC,"Jonny Evans is close to sealing an £8m move from Manchester United to Everton. The 27-year-old, currently in Seattle with the United squad on the first leg of their pre-season tour of the United States, is yet to be offered a new deal at Old Trafford to replace the final twelve months of his current contract. And the Northern Irishman’s uncertain future at United has prompted Everton manager Roberto Martinez to step up his efforts to sign the experienced centre-half.  Senior figures at Old Trafford have refused to comment on Everton’s interest in Evans, but it is understood that the two clubs are ready to compromise on a fee for a player who has racked up 198 senior appearances for United since making his debut as a nineteen-year-old in the League Cup defeat against Coventry City in September 2007.  United value Evans, a three-time Premier League title winner, at £10m, with Everton preparing to pay £6m. A deal worth an eventual £8m is expected to be completed in the coming days, however, with Martinez determined to secure a proven replacement for Frenchman Sylvain Distin, who left Goodison Park at the end of last season to complete a free transfer to Premier League newcomers Bournemouth.  United manager Louis van Gaal is prepared to keep Evans in his squad, but has made it clear to the defender that he has dropped behind Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo in the pecking order at Old Trafford. And with United also in the market for a world-class centre-half, with Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos Van Gaal’s number one target, Evans is facing up to the prospect of diminished opportunities if he stays at the club."
reddevils,3dizuu,kharma45,9,Thu Jul 16 17:36:38 2015 UTC,Ogden and Jackson wrote the same article.  Briefed by the club. Looks like this is pretty much a deal.
reddevils,3dizuu,arron77,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:15 2015 UTC,£8 million for Evans is a good fee. Hopefully he does well somewhere else. Diabolical year last year soured what had been a solid career.
reddevils,3dizuu,kharma45,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:41:53 2015 UTC,Considering RvP + Nani is probably £8m...
reddevils,3dizuu,Hassi94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:06:00 2015 UTC,RVP had a year to go on his contract so his price is reflected in that.   Nani's value was eroded in that we were happy to loan him out for free last year paying for wages and using him as a makeweight in the Rojo deal. It was clear that he had no value to Van Gaal.
reddevils,3dizuu,kharma45,2,Thu Jul 16 18:12:44 2015 UTC,Evans also only has 1 year left.

Hope this combined with LvG's comments about thinking McNair is better at CB means we'll see more of Paddy next season."
reddevils,3dizuu,dhillonaire,12,Thu Jul 16 17:52:54 2015 UTC,"Reaction here is embarrassing to be honest. Sure he had a poor year but he's a guy from the academy who's always given everything he had and has played really well in stages. I recall a season where he was probably our best defender.  Compare the reaction Jonny Evans got to the one where Anderson left. People were wishing Anderson luck while everyone here is like ""LOL 8M JONY EVENS IS SHIT!!!""  One is a guy who cost 20mil, was consistently shit, was too fat and not fit enough and cost us a lot to deliver very little. The other a guy who came from youth ranks, gave us a few good years, never moaned about not playing or anything.  Disappointed."

Take those Everton rumors with a grain of salt. It was clearly a briefing to let everyone know that Evans is up for sale. I'm sure his people have been instructed on helping him find a move also.

reddevils,3dka27,YourTypicalSaudi,18,Fri Jul 17 00:44:43 2015 UTC,Exactly. Palace finished 10th. In Spain that was Espanyol. No chance à player like Cabaye transfers there. It all boils down to revenue sharing.
reddevils,3dka27,_Dr_Jan_Itor,12,Fri Jul 17 01:19:19 2015 UTC,It actually goes both ways. Espanyol's record signing cost less than half of Cabaye. Also Espanyol currently has only 3 international players in their squad that have actually played for the team. They are far better at bringing youth through than English teams.

reddevils,3dka27,Memphisboots,4,Fri Jul 17 21:15:46 2015 UTC,"Is it though? If the only measure we have is European Competition then I'd say it's not the best. In fact you can argue the top 7 in EPL didn't match up to Spain, Germany, or Italy last season. The year before wasn't much better although Chelsea did make the semis. EPL has great talent cause of money. It's the most marketable league in the world and so that skews a bit of perception. I think the talent is amazing but for some reason the last 3 seasons EPL seems to be less about building a team and more about buying the best talent. It's similar to what real madrid does. Most marketable team in the world. They sign talent, they don't sign the best players for the team. It's for that reason they have 1 La Liga championship in the last 7 seasons."

I wouldn't know how to change it necessarily, but to me, it makes little sense that basically La Liga, Ligue 1, and Bundesliga teams benefit from the European success of the likes of their only really good teams like Barca, RM, PSG, and Bayern.  Basically the strength of those teams allow the top 4 teams from their leagues earn a spot in the CL. Which to me is bull because a Top 4 team in the PL wins 7 out of 10 games against a Bundeliga team (ManU [2015] or Arsenal [2014] vs Bayer Leverkusen).  A bit of a rant, but I think it's ridiculous that the EPL has such a low coefficient. It has us currently ranked at 20(!) whereas Benfica is at 6. Olympiacos is at 22.

We'll have Rooney, Chicha, Wilson and Memphis (when needed) to fill that spot. I don't see why we can't make it through with that.  Edit: and if Di Maria leaves, getting a new winger will be more important than getting a new striker"
reddevils,3dka27,BHButcher,-2,Thu Jul 16 23:34:20 2015 UTC,"because Rooney is 30 and has never been a huge goal scorer, Wilson is a kid, Hernandez is a poacher and offers nothing in the build up, and Memphis is a repurposed winger. We need a striker instead of Hernandez."
reddevils,3dka27,GarethGore,8,Thu Jul 16 23:49:45 2015 UTC,Rooney has never been a huge goal scorer? He's never had a season where he's scored under 15 goals until last season (14). He's arguably the most consistent striker the Premier League has had for the past 10 years
reddevils,3dka27,delli,2,Fri Jul 17 00:44:30 2015 UTC,"Put him as a striker and he scores 25+, no doubt in my mind. He's too easy to place in other positions though, so manager's don't.  Either way, it's the total amount of goals that matters, not who scores them. I am pretty sure Memphis will up Young for instance."
reddevils,3dka27,mentalcaseinspace,0,Fri Jul 17 12:30:29 2015 UTC,"true, but we need a striker who can get 25+ a season. Goals were a huge problem last season"
reddevils,3dka27,GarethGore,5,Fri Jul 17 01:13:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly how many strikers at the moment can get 25 per year on a consistent basis?  Messi, Ronaldo, lewandowski, Suarez, costa, muller, benzema, ibrahimovic, aguero, with maybe the likes of Kane, benteke, Sturridge, Lacazzette, Cavani if they are fit/keep their form. The only realistic ones on here are benteke, Kane, Lacazzette and Cavani, and I bet really only Kane would be ok being Rooneys backup.   Rooney is incredible, he will score bags of goals this year, and we will be just fine."
reddevils,3dka27,delli,2,Fri Jul 17 02:45:50 2015 UTC,That's mostly because he was either playing out of position or instructed to play a different role up top. LVG requires more than just goal scoring from him. Which is amazing in and of itself. To have a such a great player that you can burden with much more responsibilities than just be a typical goal scoring striker.  Not to mention the added responsibilities of being the captain. We're lucky to have him.
reddevils,3dka27,reddit_no_likey,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:43:47 2015 UTC,"Now that the midfield/wings are shored up, Rooney can be a dedicated striker. The issue was moving him all around the pitch He could definitely get in the 20-25 range for season total of goals if we keep him as the striker."
reddevils,3dka27,grindandshine,5,Fri Jul 17 11:01:12 2015 UTC,Then Wilson gets no game time. How are we going to give him minutes if he's 3rd choice in a system that plays one striker? I'm assuming he's 3rd choice because we'd be shipping Chicha out if we bring someone in
reddevils,3dka27,BHButcher,3,Thu Jul 16 23:51:46 2015 UTC,"He will still get time, start v low opponents in the cups and come on as a sub and start some PL games probably. But him and Hernandez shouldn't be 2nd choices IMO"
reddevils,3dka27,GarethGore,6,Fri Jul 17 00:27:47 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It's time to start investing more time on him. He's got great potential, but never gets to really heat up b/c of the lack of time on the pitch.   Just imagine how insane the pace would be with Memphis, ADM, & Wilson up top. With each of them blazing past defenders, it will be much easier for a forward like Wilson to capitalize."

However, Wilson has shown good accuracy and a good strike whenever he's had the opportunity. I think this is a youngster worth investing in.  It's always a smart thing to invest in club youth. They'll be more loyal and won't need to condition into the system. He's of age where it would be time to give him more opportunities now."

reddevils,3dka27,Bedoah,6,Fri Jul 17 09:28:11 2015 UTC,"I think Otamendi is coming. Valencia left him out of their season promo/kit launch pic. Of course, that's by no means a clincher but that signs are pointing that way.  I have a feeling that the plan was to get Otamendi plus Ramos if we can get him.   Reus would be great. Griezmann would be great. If we get a top RW, I think Chica if he stays would actually a great second option as he can be alleviated of much of the build up play and be a poacher. He already has PL experience.   As most have already pointed out, a CB (ideally two) plus a forward (whether striker or RW) will do the trick. If De Gea stays, then a back up goalie, if he leaves, then I'd say go for Oblak."

I don't want to see Di Maria leave either but I guess if he actually wants to (which I'm not convinced he does) and we get a good fee (50m +), so be it. I just hope we have someone lined up to replace him otherwise it's a stupid move.   Now if we humour the idea of Di Maria leaving and us spending big to replace him, who would you have? I'd kill for Reus or Griezmann. They're going to play a big role in a top European side sometime soon and we might as well go for them if Di Maria leaves. What do you guys think?

Ibrahimovic said: 'Koeman went mad. He was furious at Van Gaal. 'He felt that statement meant his hands were tied and limited his chances to fight for me.'  Ibrahimovic, who refers to Van Gaal as 'a pompous a***' in his autobiography I Am Zlatan, also revealed how Van Gaal 'stuck his oar in' at a meeting with Koeman to discuss his performances."

With all these PSG rumors flying around and them apparently refusing to include any players in the deal, I really hope we reopen negotiations with Bayern. Even though Rummenigge was adamant no other players will be leaving to Man Utd this summer, Di Maria just might change that. I hope he stays, however, but it's not looking good."
reddevils,3dka27,beckham_7,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:12:46 2015 UTC,We would only want Muller or Lewandowski as replacements for Di Maria. What's the point in a swap if they are already low on wingers and strikers?
reddevils,3dka27,weirdlytwisted,2,Fri Jul 17 11:38:19 2015 UTC,"Well I wouldn't say they are ""low"" on wingers but age (and subsequently) injuries are starting to take their toll. They have Robben (31) and Ribery (32) - they were both injured for quite a good part of last year's season and they need to slowly start phasing them out.   Lewandowski never plays on the wing, he is a classic number 9, whereas Müller (even though he is very versatile) is best in a false 9 position. He can play the wing, sure, but he is not your typical winger.   Di Maria is exactly what they need, and Müller is exactly what we need. We won't be getting Lewandowski imo, there is no chance he would play 2nd fiddle to Rooney, and quite frankly he is too good for the bench (that's assuming we will be playing with a single striker). Müller would be perfect because he could slot into LW or RW when Rooney is fit, and in case of Rooney's injury also play ST.  I know it's highly unlikely, but United have shown they mean serious business in the market and to me Müller would be the ideal marquee signing. I can only dream."
reddevils,3dka27,beckham_7,2,Fri Jul 17 13:16:54 2015 UTC,Lewandoski is a far better number 9 than Rooney.

Just because we'd have a better back line doesn't mean we should be content with Romero as a starting goalkeeper. Difference in quality between De Gea and Romero is enormous. We'd immediately go from having the best GK in the PL and one of the best in the world to not even having the best GK of the PL's top 4. Oblak/Leno/Lloris are all much, much better than Romero. The way I see it is Romero will come to be a back up, to take Valdés' spot, and I'd be fine with that. But as a starting goalkeeper we can do so much better."

When I see what we do in training and the quality we have I am sure we have the chance to win titles. I am convinced about that.”"

But my goal was always to win the Champions League with my club Bayern Munich. Now I am happy to be here.  'My brother is a huge Manchester United fan. He is a big Eric Cantona and Ryan Giggs fan. It was always a dream to be a Manchester United player.  'I saw the 1999 Champions League final between United and Bayern at home. My brother had the United jersey on and I had Bayern's.

reddevils,3di5ss,ManUToaster,-3,Thu Jul 16 15:58:00 2015 UTC,Or at least not repeat what she may or may not have said as fact.   You know you have access to google and can watch the video yourself right?  Although it's not meant in the malicious way it was interpreted she did agree with the host that the city is ugly (like the back of a fridge) and that you have to look for specific places that are nice.  What she made clear was that she doesn't enjoy the travel.
reddevils,3di5ss,SluDge1,3,Thu Jul 16 17:05:37 2015 UTC,"Lol dude I know how to google thanks, I also know Spanish, do you? She just said it is not very pretty and you have to find the nice areas..."
reddevils,3di5ss,ManUToaster,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:53:31 2015 UTC,So then why are you making nonsensical comments about what she may or may not have said?  It's clear what she said regardless of whether she denied it - or more accurately - tried to justify it after the fact.  What doubt is there to benefit her with?
reddevils,3di5ss,SluDge1,2,Thu Jul 16 18:34:04 2015 UTC,"Lol what's nonsensical about me saying we shouldn't repeat the ""back of the fridge"" quote as fact? I'll make it easy for you:  A- Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge huh?  B- it's not very pretty, you have to look for certain areas (ironically she also said David is here so that's what matters, sort of similar to what Ramos' lady said and everyone is saying Edurne should take note...).  You- Edurne calls Manchester uglier than the back of a fridge  So you think she just adopted the interviewer's quote because she didn't reject it? And then afterwards when she was attributed with the quote she totally denied it but I guess if she's not a bitch this is no fun or something lol??? To say that she said Manchester is uglier than the back of a fridge is just stupid, but whatever maybe I'm just being nonsensical."
reddevils,3di5ss,ManUToaster,-9,Thu Jul 16 18:55:06 2015 UTC,It seems like you have comprehension problems.  Read my original response to your nonsensical assertion.  It's clear you're trying to be combative and argumentative over a dumb comment.
reddevils,3di5ss,SluDge1,-2,Thu Jul 16 19:03:40 2015 UTC,"It seems like you have comprehension problems.  Read my original response to your nonsensical assertion.   Lol and you follow that by accusing me of being ""combative""? Maybe you're the one with comprehension problems.   Also, for the record, I couldn't care less about Edurne, I just pointed out that you shouldn't attribute quotes to her as fact when she denied making them. To make matters worse (or funnier), you linked a video that just proved she never said what you accused her of saying. More so, you decided to be a little diva and show me how to google stuff 😂.   Maybe we got off on he wrong foot, I was just trying to make the very reasonable point that we should be careful attributing quotes to people and handling that as fact."

reddevils,3di5ss,Entrepreneur_Girl,18,Thu Jul 16 14:25:45 2015 UTC,"I think the downvotes are mainly because you implied that if they were married, Ramos' gf was obliged to follow him."
reddevils,3di5ss,Syri0Forel,16,Thu Jul 16 14:30:30 2015 UTC,What makes the comment even weirder is that she is a girl so she's being sexist to herself by saying women must follow the man?   Also the reason Edurne doesn't move is because she is supposed to be a bit of a celebrity in Spain so it would be detrimental to her career to move to Manchester.
reddevils,3di5ss,CosmicGravy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:37:01 2015 UTC,Well at the ens of the day it's her opinion and what she believes in. That doesn't her wrong at all. Everyone is different especially regarding local customs. So each to their own.
reddevils,3di5ss,Gradiu5,4,Thu Jul 16 14:47:43 2015 UTC,Yeah of course. I actually approve of what she said as my girlfriend is a bit of a cunt so it has turned me into a natural chauvinistic pig. /s
reddevils,3di5ss,CosmicGravy,0,Thu Jul 16 15:01:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with \u\A_hiccup there are different perspectives to this, I'm just stating in a society that claims that marriage is he biggest sign of commitment. I mean both men and women have to move to whichever country because of whichever partners career is booming the most, people are most comfortable with moving for their partners career if they are married because they have that ""security"". In a relationship there isn't that sense of security, they start worrying that it might not work and they either choose to leave or try do the long distance thing before deciding.  Trust I know, my ex and I were together for 7 years and she refused to move with me when my business was doing well. She would only move once we were married and I wasn't ready, so we went our separate ways. Don't want to get into depth with this discussion.   I just don't want to seem narrow minded"
reddevils,3di5ss,Entrepreneur_Girl,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:57:21 2015 UTC,"Not ancient thinking at all (evident in the fact that some people share that way of thinking).

reddevils,3di5ss,Entrepreneur_Girl,10,Thu Jul 16 14:24:15 2015 UTC,"Umm. I think you're getting downvoted because of associating marriage with the idea of the woman being in some obligatory situation where she has to sacrifice it all for the husband moving around. Many men/women live in different countries for their job needs, married or not, and still make their relationship work.   Before this thread becomes some weird discussion on marital/non-martial compromises, these are different perspectives of looking at the same situation."

reddevils,3dqg6b,evilelephantrides,10,Sat Jul 18 17:24:16 2015 UTC,I think you need to learn the difference between a first team and a preferred starting 11.
reddevils,3dqg6b,BadCowz,7,Sat Jul 18 14:12:50 2015 UTC,"I don't believe Memphis should be a guaranteed starter yet. As I've said previously, he's done great things for PSV and has serious talent. But this is the Premier League and Manchester United and those are huge steps up. After last season Young should start before him IMO.   Also, Di Maria has to be in there somewhere!"
reddevils,3dqg6b,united1020,2,Sat Jul 18 13:53:11 2015 UTC,"But where? Let's not be including players for the sake of having a big name... He isn't a natural winger and wasn't especially good there for Madrid. Van Gaal doesnt like him in a midfield three either. He is struggling with injuries and can't find form, he puts no effort into his game so doesn't deserve a place IMO. Why is Di Maria a starter but Depay not? Fellaini, Young, Mata all deserve a spot ahead of him after last season . IMO Di Maria has far more to prove than anyone if he does stay but if reports are correct, he looks set on going."
reddevils,3dqg6b,ReflectingGod,4,Sat Jul 18 14:00:06 2015 UTC,"It's tough. I don't think we just slot him in because of the name but on his day DiMa is a top 10 player IMO. Also, I meant it more as OP just completely left him out. Even in the subs, along with a few other names.   Last year was his first season and it is taking a little bit longer for him to come around as I had hoped.   But if we can find him a spot, such as LVG coming around and placing him in the midfield, then I believe he can get his form and adapt to the Premier League and do great things for us.   It just sort of comes of like people are rushing to put Memphis in the starting 11 because we have a shiny new toy.   EDIT:    Why is Di Maria a starting and Depay not?    Well why should Memphis be a starter? I love the kid and am certainly excited for him to be here, but he just got here and has done nothing yet to prove he's a deserved starter for Manchester United.   IMO Young should be our LW."
reddevils,3dqg6b,united1020,2,Sat Jul 18 14:06:52 2015 UTC,"I absolutely agree on the Memphis part. Many people expect him to come in and bag plenty of goals. He scored just over 20 in the Dutch league... 7 came from free-kicks (not guaranteed on taking them) and he played a fair amount as a striker.  As for Di Maria, I don't think he has a place in the team. Its a shame because he really is one of the best players in the world, best in the league on his day but his day came about like twice last season. He just reminds me of Yaya Toure, a good player on the occasion but just doesn't consistently put the effort in and ultimately only cares for the £200k paycheck that comes in at the end of the week.  I wrote the following on another post regarding Di Maria and lots of people seemed to agree:   [Unpopular Opinion] I never really felt Di Maria was all that invested in the club. He never really gave his all in matches and we saw little of what he showed in Madrid. Its a shame to have seen him flop and I wish him well in the future if he is to move but we can live without him - his best position isn't on the right wing anyway (where I assume is where he'd be played). Its a shame that injuries got the better of him as he was truly brilliant in his first few when everything went his way and I still believe that on his day, he is arguably the best player in the Premier League. Unfortunately that day only came about 4 times and his injury problems continue to haunt him whilst also being out of favor in his preferred position in a possession based system. We need players that want to play for us and I fear Di Maria is unmotivated... Seeing as we get little from losing him, I'd like to see us play hardball on the fee. £43m is a fair price for him after last season (we over-payed to begin with) but PSG have no FFP restrictions and like City, are willing to splash out silly money on decent players. I'm sure we could easily get at least £50m for him.   Who knows, the selling of Di Maria may be an incentive to get the next big player in, a natural goal scoring winger."
reddevils,3dqg6b,ReflectingGod,2,Sat Jul 18 14:16:00 2015 UTC,"While I can sort of see the comparison to Yaya, in terms of having the incredible potential to do amazing things but coming off as unmotivated I will say that if you go back and watch when he scores his celebrations and excitement show a different story.  My biggest issue I guess is that I don't want us to get rid of our most expensive signing ever after one season. Just to watch him possibly struggle in France for a season and then come into form for the second and be a world beater or something like that.   I will admit I'm a bit biased, I absolutely adore Di Maria. I think he deserves one more season and hopefully he can adapt before jumping to get rid of him so quickly."
reddevils,3dqg6b,united1020,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:14:50 2015 UTC,He played in a midfield three at the start of the season and was great before he got injured. I think he'd be great there again paired with Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin.
reddevils,3dqg6b,Dry_Oasis,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:26:54 2015 UTC,"Well he played in a Diamond but that was discontinued as Van Gaal didn't think there was enough balance and the formation as a whole just wasn't working. Playing Di Maria in a midfield 3 also means no Herrera who i think significantly improves our midfield. He is very consistent and has earn't his place. He works effortlessly whereas Di Maria doesn't and he is also really inconsistent, has been for us, was for Madrid (to an extent)."

reddevils,3dj7wv,HuzaifaElahi,5,Thu Jul 16 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"Hmm, not quite. Messi is priceless and has no connection to United. Muller was given his senior debut by LvG, has expressed interest in United before and Bayern will sell at the right price. If we get 45/50 mil for AdM then a similar bid from us for Muller would be considered. What's more likely to turn Bayern's heads would be offering AdM in a swap deal. Whatever happens, if AdM goes, someone big needs to come in"
reddevils,3dj7wv,jakebam1,4,Thu Jul 16 21:41:57 2015 UTC,"We can chuck double what you're suggesting for Muller and even if Bayern accept, he's literally the personification of Bayern, no way in a trillion years he moves unless we offer fucking 350K a week or some Messi level wages to MAYBE convince him."
reddevils,3dj7wv,HuzaifaElahi,5,Thu Jul 16 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"People said the same about Schweinsteiger before he came, being at the club for so many years. If/When he decides to move on, and lets face it, he's been in the Bundesliga for a long time now, going to work in the PL with LvG is an attractive option. As was shown with Falcao, wages don't seem to be an issue for us at the moment. I'm not saying it's likely, but it's miles and miles from recruiting Messi"
reddevils,3dj7wv,jakebam1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:27:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't put Anderson in the same bracket as Di Maria at all, just my opinion.   Saying that though if we sold Di Maria and managed to get Reus or Griezzman I would be over the fucking moon."
reddevils,3dj7wv,chickensoup1,4,Thu Jul 16 23:32:27 2015 UTC,"I think LvG can mold him, he has massive talent."
reddevils,3dj7wv,HuzaifaElahi,0,Thu Jul 16 22:09:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's true too. For me though we have enough with Depay/Januzaj/Wilson etc in youth terms, I would prefer if we went for someone like Reus or Griezmann. Either of those signings would be amazing but hasn't Reus signed a new contract, and Griezmann only moved last summer?"
reddevils,3dj7wv,chickensoup1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:49 2015 UTC,Griezmann has a clause so we have a chance there. Reus won't leave.
reddevils,3dj7wv,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:14:55 2015 UTC,Oh right well either of those would be a perfect replacement I think.
reddevils,3dj7wv,chickensoup1,8,Thu Jul 16 22:16:07 2015 UTC,If we lose ADM (which I don't think will happen) we would go all in on another world class player (ie bale). There wouldn't be a lapse of multi years without a true United #7.
reddevils,3dj7wv,hardgour,7,Thu Jul 16 22:18:19 2015 UTC,Depay will likely take the shirt.
reddevils,3dj7wv,kharma45,4,Thu Jul 16 19:15:55 2015 UTC,I've been thinking that after doing some reading. And bale would want #11.

reddevils,3dj7wv,kharma45,13,Fri Jul 17 00:36:03 2015 UTC,"I'd be disappointed if he left this summer because I think the new signings will leave him with fewer defensive responsibilities and allow him to focus on terrorizing the opponents' defense, his specialty. That being said, if he hates Manchester and is truly unhappy here, then we should not hold him hostage here."
reddevils,3dj7wv,Syri0Forel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:05:36 2015 UTC,"I didn't think about our signings affecting Di Maria's quality, but you're absolutely right.   The defense as a whole has improved (on paper), even without a cb signing yet. Di Maria's tendency to float out of position won't impact us as harshly.  And this in turn would help take pressure off Rooney/Hernandez/Wilson, if we don't buy another striker or sell Hernandez.   There are a lot of assumptions in there, like Di Maria keeping his Copa America form, but our offense could dominate next year."
reddevils,3dj7wv,0lberding,55,Thu Jul 16 19:12:45 2015 UTC,"Mata, Rooney, Shaw and Young can take on players too. If a player is not settling in, we would be shooting ourselves in the foot to keep him on the books. He wants out. Let it be. Get another winger."
reddevils,3dj7wv,A_hiccup,22,Fri Jul 17 05:22:32 2015 UTC,"Mata and Rooney tend not to take on players, especially Mata even when he played out wide. IIRC, others were saying how even when he played right mid, he wasn't a conventional winger. He doesn't run straight at players and try and get passed them in that sense, nor is he the fastest player. While Young did that well this previous season, who knows if it'll continue into the next. Especially since he's getting old and he relies mostly on pace. And sure Shaw can get past people with the occasional run but in the end he's a left back, not a winger. So his main goal is defending, attacking with a left back should come second. That leaves Januzaj who didn't have the best season but he is young, and could do well in the future and Memphis (who I'm particularly excited for but hasn't debuted in the EPL yet). While we do have some options, none of them are on the level of Di Maria's. I still believe that he could be able to stay and fit in and replicate his early form with Man Utd. If we do oust him, who do we pick up instead? I can't think of anyone on his level of play. I'm perhaps typing this up more so out of denial, hoping that he doesn't leaving, than to try and prove you wrong tbh. Anyways, that was my opinion, I typed up a bit more than I meant to but oh well."
reddevils,3dj7wv,giraffekisses,5,Thu Jul 16 18:35:05 2015 UTC,Totally agree with that assessment!
reddevils,3dj7wv,dr_pepperpenis,20,Thu Jul 16 20:08:16 2015 UTC,In what world do Rooney or Mata take on a man and beat him 1v1.
reddevils,3dj7wv,lambomrclago,3,Thu Jul 16 20:33:10 2015 UTC,Rooney is faster with the ball than a lot of people give him credit for and his touch is often (not always) very good while Mata is a fantastically intelligent player who finds amazing positions (somewhat like Silva does/did)   You can use more than step overs to beat a man 1 v 1.
reddevils,3dj7wv,Plugpin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:05:43 2015 UTC,"Thats true, but Mata rarely if ever does it."
reddevils,3dj7wv,lambomrclago,2,Fri Jul 17 07:16:17 2015 UTC,"Rooney has the quality, although it's never running at someone, it's always just one perfect touch that gets him around the guy, usually from a cross or lob in. Mata doesn't best guys outright but he is extremely clever and I think works well out wide, although I believe he is better as a CAM"
reddevils,3dj7wv,JTRut,3,Fri Jul 17 13:09:04 2015 UTC,"Yes, they're both incredibly good players, Rooney I believe is world class. They don't run at players and try to beat them 1v1"

reddevils,3dj7wv,aman27deep,4,Thu Jul 16 22:34:26 2015 UTC,"Not that I'm disagreeing about Mata, but pace isn't everything. Good technique and dribbling is all you need. Lots of players without pace can dribble past players 1v1. Think players like Iniesta. Great dribblers will find a way past."
reddevils,3dj7wv,DurdenCommaTyler,3,Thu Jul 16 23:03:55 2015 UTC,Beating a man isn't all about just sprinting past him
reddevils,3dj7wv,NumberJuanMataFan,2,Fri Jul 17 00:04:26 2015 UTC,Mata is a phenomenal player. He has not gone past a man 1v1 in his United career.

reddevils,3dj7wv,AngryUncleTony,16,Fri Jul 17 02:21:15 2015 UTC,"People tend to forget about youth, not only.adnan. I honestly expect to see a lot more of adnan,pereira and lingard this season.."
reddevils,3dj7wv,AMAaboutA,10,Thu Jul 16 18:38:57 2015 UTC,"When these stories first came out, I thought there's no way we should sell him, there's only a handful of players anywhere at his level. But as I've thought about it, he really is a square peg (albeit a very shiny and glorious one that still might come back to bite us), and as Young showed last season it doesn't necessarily matter how good a player is unless they fit into the team. I really am excited to see Jesse get a shot, people forget he started the first game last year. Also, I have dreams of an interchanging, dynamic front three of Memphis, Wilson, and Adnan taking on Europe for the next decade."
reddevils,3dj7wv,AngryUncleTony,-1,Thu Jul 16 20:00:21 2015 UTC,"Young showed last season it doesn't necessarily matter how good a player is unless they fit into the team.    come on, this is nonsense. Young was routinely taking on defenders, a lot of the time in pairs and would always get passed them. Di Maria would do the same thing but he would lose the ball almost every single time. All of that is down to individual skill, decision making and dribbling."
reddevils,3dj7wv,berzerkerz,3,Thu Jul 16 20:14:39 2015 UTC,"I think we agree. I was saying that for as good as Angel was, he would frequently give the ball away (hence the poor fit was LVG's possession scheme). He also didn't have the same defensive tenacity Ashley did, hence Ash was the better fit."

reddevils,3dj7wv,berzerkerz,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:43:29 2015 UTC,"Adnan does have the capability, but he struggled majorly this season (as the team as a whole did), and he wasn't beating the first man a lot of the time. I really hope he gets his form though."
reddevils,3dj7wv,Chocolatedippedbacon,3,Fri Jul 17 01:10:01 2015 UTC,I think adnan focuses too much on beating guys and less on practicality. He's young so that's alright but I think it's something he needs to think about before he tries to needlessly beat a guy. I have high hopes for him
reddevils,3dj7wv,JTRut,2,Thu Jul 16 22:46:50 2015 UTC,Everyone does but I think he's massively overhyped sadly
reddevils,3dj7wv,huey88,9,Fri Jul 17 00:04:56 2015 UTC,"Rooney and Mata can take on players?! In what universe? Young? Sure, but mainly during his Aston Villa days, now he's too afraid to dribble down the flank. Shaw - I can agree here, he's very fast and energetic. We should have a dribbler in the Hazard type, maybe Depay will become this kind of player."
reddevils,3dj7wv,edmontom,2,Fri Jul 17 02:24:05 2015 UTC,We can't be sure he wants out. You can't judge a player based on what the MEDIA assume.

reddevils,3dj7wv,GarethGore,37,Fri Jul 17 07:41:01 2015 UTC,"[Unpopular Opinion] I never really felt Di Maria was all that invested in the club. He never really gave his all in matches and we saw little of what he showed in Madrid. Its a shame to have seen him flop and I wish him well in the future if he is to move but we can live without him - his best position isn't on the right wing anyway (where I assume is where he'd be played).  Its a shame that injuries got the better of him as he was truly brilliant in his first few when everything went his way and I still believe that on his day, he is arguably the best player in the Premier League. Unfortunately that day only came about 4 times and his injury problems continue to haunt him whilst also being out of favor in his preferred position in a possession based system.  We need players that want to play for us and I fear Di Maria is unmotivated...  Seeing as we get little from losing him, I'd like to see us play hardball on the fee. £43m is a fair price for him after last season (we over-payed to begin with) but PSG have no FFP restrictions and like City, are willing to splash out silly money on decent players. I'm sure we could easily get at least £50m for him."
reddevils,3dj7wv,ReflectingGod,4,Thu Jul 16 22:01:16 2015 UTC,"I've thought that watching him, and a lot of the United fans saying otherwise are kind of looking at it through rose tinted glasses. Maybe it's just the first year in a tough league, but only time will tell if he really wants to be here. Seems like the interest is real from PSG, so if Di Maria wants to leave, it sort of proves he didn't really want to come in the first place."
reddevils,3dj7wv,BrendonAG92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We can now use this opportunity to get one of their players (though I think Marquinhos is the only one worth taking) or better yet use this as an incentive to go out and break the bank for a massive player to replace him like Griezmann, Reus or even Müller."
reddevils,3dj7wv,ReflectingGod,3,Thu Jul 16 21:31:34 2015 UTC,"Muller won't go, Bayern already said no more players to United, maybe a bit of a shot at some of our supposed bids for him. Reus is quality, but he has a pretty poor injury record, and I'm not sure I see him leaving. Greizmann would be great, not sure if I see him featuring in LVG's plans or not, as you'd think he would have went for him last year when he was available."
reddevils,3dj7wv,BrendonAG92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:38:15 2015 UTC,"I personally don't think injuries or the break in affected him.  It was when we had the tough run of chelsea and city LVG went to 4-3-3 and played ADM on the right (v Chelsea). He was terrible. In swinging crosses from 50 yards out, it was pointless."
reddevils,3dj7wv,mink_man,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:26:32 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, he's been terrible from about Novemberish on. Stupid shots that did nothing, poor crosses, extremely poor set pieces, and the list goes on. It's like he didn't take the club, or his position seriously at times.

reddevils,3dj7wv,legojs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:03:42 2015 UTC,He gave his all in matches because it is clear that he is a high risk/reward player he will create a lot of chances and quite often it doesn't come off. He already had the 2nd amount of league assists and is in a new league and do I need to remind you of some the football we were playing last season you cant turn a player like di maria into a striker or into a player whose sole purpose is to get the ball to felllaini. You saying di maria is unmotivated is BS because he has come out to the media plenty of times and said he wants to prove himself.

reddevils,3dj7wv,lambomrclago,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:15:10 2015 UTC,"I think it really depends who we would replace him with. Is he a top talent? Yes without a doubt, but anyone that's watched him will say he isn't exactly consistant. His last year was a bit of an exception as everything sort of fell into place for Madrid.   So let's look at a few possiblities. First we sell him for around 50 million. With the rest of our Chevy and Adidas deal, we would have close to 100 million left to spend. Realistic options would be Griezman or maybe Anderson. I don't see Reus leaving, maybe ever, and Bale I feel wants to give it another season. I suppose we could go all out for Ronaldo, but is he really worth the price/wages? I'm sure shirt sales would bring in a fortune, but I see him more of a striker now than anything.   The other option is we sell him and pocket the money. We have a few wingers that could fill the space, and maybe try and shop when something better opens up. Lingard has the potential to be a very good player, and Memphis could get to that Hazard level I think no problem. It remains to be seen if he could get up to the Messi or Ronaldo level. Young still has a few years, and Januzaj and Peraira (bad spelling) may start to perform with more game time.   There's also the option where he stays, and this is all bullshit. Personally I feel like this is what's likely, as he's said he wants to come back multiples times, unlike De Gea who's stayed silent on the whole issue. Whatever happens, I'm sure LVG has ideas of what he wants, and I trust he knows what he's doing."
reddevils,3dj7wv,BrendonAG92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:19:56 2015 UTC,I hope United don't pocket the money...  99.9% of the fun of the summer is engaging in complete pie in the sky stuff and then watching United pulling off a dreamland signing! :D  We can't go wrong with getting either Reus or Griezmann in the squad. Both would contribute immensely. And I think they'd probably come provided the money was right.

reddevils,3dj7wv,lezendo,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:36:23 2015 UTC,"i see similarities between this situation and Veron's; insofar as that they're two great individual talents but with no real place on the team.   ADM's best performances came when LVG played him at LCM in a diamond midfield where he's been able to utilize his excellent work rate to get plenty of touches of the ball from his base starting position in the middle of the park, and then the freedom to utilize his skills on the ball to dribble outside into space.   but since we as a team have played our best football in a 4-3-3, i don't see where he can fit in. He hasn't had great performances for us when we play this formation.  i believe a big part of the reason why he thrived starting in the middle LCM for Madrid's 4-3-3 was because Ronaldo, playing at LW,  frequently roamed inside and thus allowed the space for Di Maria to dribble outside. Ashey Young on the other hand is a more traditional winger that stays near the sidelines. Now if Depay were to win the starting role at LW, then he could complement ADM's style at LCM because he too likes to wander inside. But with the signings of Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger it doesn't seem like ADM will get a lot of opportunities at LCM anyway, plus this season LVG has indicated he prefers taller, stronger, CMs.   When it comes to LW in a 4-3-3, Ashley Young got the starting LW role over ADM, and rightfully so, Young deserved that role based on his performances. And with Depay coming in and already being familiar with 'the philosophy' that just represents another hurdle between ADM and a starting spot. And yeah, Mata isn't as flashy as ADM, but in the grand scheme of things he's a more effective player. He works better with his surrounding teammates (especially Herrera), has better understanding of his tactical role, and executes that role exactly how LVG wants him too.   if ADM can adjust and outplay either of them to a starting spot in pre-season then i'd glady have him on the team. But if he can't, then i'd rather have him sold for  around 60M Euros and have that money used to finance the transfer of a CB and backup striker. Even without ADM we have 2 solid wingers and 2 more who have shown massive potential; Young, Mata, Depay, and Janujaz. that's honestly more than enough when you consider there's other areas that we need to more urgently address."
reddevils,3dj7wv,DoctorWitten,0,Fri Jul 17 06:23:33 2015 UTC,"I see it now more like this: the club doesn't want to sell him. Van Gaal said he counts on him. So if Di Maria wants to leave, he should leave. But I really do hope Woodward won't sell him for cheap. PSG have all the money in the world. They paid 50 million for David Luiz. Just ask 70 million for Di Maria or they can just fuck off(they want him so bad, might as well pay lots of money for the player who still has a contract with us til 2019)"

reddevils,3dixc2,Yan-e-toe,-45,Thu Jul 16 19:05:07 2015 UTC,I highly doubt that. We would have signed him regardless.
reddevils,3dixc2,Shadowbanned24601,44,Thu Jul 16 19:45:11 2015 UTC,It was specifically part of the deal.  Here's Sporting's statement.  United paid 100% of Nani's wages during the loan.  Definitely part of the Rojo deal.
reddevils,3dixc2,shinkag,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:55:01 2015 UTC,"No, it was a part of the deal. Rojo was about 75% owned by a third party, they would get 75% of the fee. By selling him for 16 and getting Nani + his wages covered then Sporting got about 4m as well as Nani's 5 or so covered, a player they really wanted. If they just sold him for 20 they'd have only got 5m. So it was a part of the deal, it was a swap."
reddevils,3dixc2,RickyBoyd,5,Fri Jul 17 00:56:44 2015 UTC,I think he means that the officials from both clubs have been in contact and have already been able to work out a deal before so it's highly possible they can do it again but for a player going another way.

There is a massive difference between what you want to occur personally and what is actually occurring in reality. We're at a point now where anything relating to Di Maria is getting downvoted by a mob simply because they don't want him to leave personally but ignores the fact that in reality, all fingers point to him going. It's stopping us having a debate and a real informative discussion on who is coming in to replace him and how the team will play without him.

reddevils,3djlll,AngryUncleTony,9,Thu Jul 16 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for posting this.  For months I was really hoping he would stay and I was also very sure he would. Everyone was so happy when we signed Di Maria and he was amazing in his first few games. When he came to the club he gave an interview where he said Manchester United was the only club he wanted to leave Real Madrid for. And even though I know you can't trust footballers on their words, it just doesn't feel good when you know a player is just here with us because he couldn't go to another club because of FFP rules.   I also think right now is the right time to let Di Maria go if he wants to go. Yes he said many times he wanted to stay etc but he's said so many things, I don't think we can really count him on his words anymore. For the last few weeks he's been linked to PSG so many times, in France they are so sure he wants to join them.   And to be fair; I'm kinda 'scared'  he will fall out with LVG if he stays. I just have the feeling because Di Maria will most likely play on the wings for us and it's not his best position. He's so inconsistent on the wings, also for Argentina. One game he can be just so frustrating to watch and the next game he's the best player on the pitch. And since we bought Schweinsteiger + Schneiderlin and we also still have Herrera, I don't think we actually will see Di Maria back on his best position which is the left central midfield. So if LVG benches him again, it will only causes more problems in the club. Just compare the Di Maria situation with Herrera's situation. Herrera was on the bench for such a long time and the media weren't really that much on it. Of course we as the fans were frustrated with it but the media(in Spain also) didn't pay too much attention with it. Same when Mata was on the bench for a long time. Di Maria has always been a starter for us whenever he was fit until 9 march. We played against arsenal and he got a red card. After that he couldn't play for one match because he was suspended and suddenly we played our best games of the season(not saying it was because he wasn't on the pitch). But the media were all over it and people blamed LVG for hating South-Americans etc even though LVG sticked up for Di Maria so many times in the media whenever he got asked why Di Maria was playing bad etc."
reddevils,3djlll,ReflectingGod,17,Thu Jul 16 21:28:55 2015 UTC,"Just posted this on another thread, but for as good as he is he's wasted if he doesn't fit the system (and it really seems like he doesn't). If it means Jesse, Adnan, and Andreas get more shots I'm all for recouping whatever we can get for him. That being said we really could look silly if he tears it up in the CL next year."
reddevils,3djlll,AngryUncleTony,9,Thu Jul 16 20:24:51 2015 UTC,"We'd only look stupid if we didn't get a suitable replacement in. We need a proper RW. Many people fancy Reus and Griezmann, both would be fantastic bets IMO and are both very versatile also. It'd be like killing two birds with one stone as we'd also have our striker ""problem"" sorted also with both being very capable of moving in for Rooney with Young or Mata moving into the RW position for time being."
reddevils,3djlll,ReflectingGod,7,Thu Jul 16 20:21:42 2015 UTC,"Fair point, but I think back to the comments LVG made recently where he said that he prefers to develop players rather than buy them. It's been floating around that he wants to try Januzaj as striker, and he already said that Memphis can play there. So while it would be amazing to sign one of those players, I don't necessarily see it happening. The striker in his system doesn't have to be a Zlatan or even Costa type target forward so much as a willing and smart runner that can finish. Won't complain though if either of them (or Bale) come along though, even if it ruins my fantasies of a dynamic front three of Memphis - Wilson - Januzaj leading our line for the next decade."
reddevils,3djlll,AngryUncleTony,2,Thu Jul 16 20:51:18 2015 UTC,"They still can and maybe will but they're still incredibly young and I personally don't believe we can afford to be giving them regular 90 mins yet in such a fierce competition. Field them in cup games and bring them on as subs in the PL, we could even start them in an easier PL game but in the meantime we need a quality player that will get the job done at the highest level otherwise we can say bye to our trophy hopes. We need to integrate youth in slowly, this season especially as we desperately need some silverware."
reddevils,3djlll,peduxe,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:01:54 2015 UTC,"Hear you on all points, but it's just such a fine line between integrating them slowly and blocking a path such that they never develop or choose to leave. I know we need the quality now, but it's still in the back of my mind."
reddevils,3djlll,blorimer542,3,Thu Jul 16 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"This is clearly the unique way I can see things working out. There's no way Darmian will make that whole right wing alone, Mata isn't that reliable for right winger, he's capable but he never puts in a shift to attack his man because he cuts inside and passes too often, normal, he is an AM. Neither will Young, don't remember the game but last season late in this game he and AdM switched wings and it turned to Young being completely invisible for the rest of the game, folks were discussing this in the post match thread too.  Then there's Valencia, Van Gaal said he will be competing with Darmian for RB and it's obvious he doesn't rate him that highly for the right wing, well neither do us."
reddevils,3djlll,peduxe,2,Thu Jul 16 21:15:22 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling that Gaitan is being lined up as a replacement in case Di Maria does leave. Simply based off of Di Marzio, and some quotes from his agent saying that he was in contact with an English club."
reddevils,3djlll,blorimer542,3,Thu Jul 16 21:05:54 2015 UTC,"No way, Van Gaal always had a rant on our excessive number of players for the ""10"" position, Mata is much better than Gaitan, we're good there."

reddevils,3djlll,blorimer542,4,Thu Jul 16 21:12:31 2015 UTC,He can play on the left wing. But I preferred to omit this point as we already have Memphis and an in pretty good form Young. There's no need for more competition.

reddevils,3djlll,King-Eric,4,Thu Jul 16 21:24:53 2015 UTC,"If he goes we will buy someone, I'm almost certain.  Young, Mata, Januzaj, Memphis is not a title winning set of wingers at all."

reddevils,3djlll,wh11,3,Thu Jul 16 21:35:48 2015 UTC,The only one I can think of is Griezmann. He would be the perfect fit for United.He is very similar to Alexis Sanchez IMO.He scores loads of goals and also contributes a lot to the team's build up play. His price wouldn't be an issue for United as United can directly spend the amount received by selling Di Maria or even less.40 million pounds for him would be the right price IMO considering the inflated market.
reddevils,3djlll,waiting4myteeth,2,Thu Jul 16 23:42:26 2015 UTC,Why would LVG buy him if he doesn't fit the system
reddevils,3djlll,LomoSaltadoMontado,3,Fri Jul 17 05:15:56 2015 UTC,He hadn't decided on a system at the time and didn't know the squad and the player as well as he does now.

He wouldn't have brought him here if ADM didn't fit that system.  From ADM's point of view, it's ridiculously hasty to move after one bad half-season. You don't get to where he is without a setback or two. I'd be amazed if he wasn't resilient enough to stay at United. He's been at Real already, there's no move for him that isn't a step down."

reddevils,3djlll,King-Eric,4,Fri Jul 17 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"I think this not just about being unsettled here, Di Maria doesn't fit our possession based game and didn't looked that much interested when things weren't going that well, re-watch some of last season matches and you will see it.  I guess it was clear to everyone here, by the way our midfield were in shambles last season I never expected it to work well. He might really be gone this season just a matter of saying it, LvG seemed very open and to agree with it and I think it is for the best, it would leave a place for a right winger that we've been missing for so long."

reddevils,3dkp49,baggios_ponytail,25,Fri Jul 17 01:27:13 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be brutally honest - I don't expect Wilson or Januzaj to be as good as one of the greatest players of all time or be challenging for the top scorer at United and England. Rooney and Ronaldo had potential to be a world class.  They only needed to develop consistency and a tactical understanding of the game. They gave you flashes which Neymar and Hazard were showing a couple of years back. Hence, they were worth developing. There's a club in London who've been developing players for quite some time and in general I don't see their fanbase being too happy now. LVG is ruthless enough to show RVP the door, his captain during his Dutch managerial days. He is pragmatic enough to only sparingly use Januzaj and Wilson as he has done last year. Only if they are brilliant or if we are unlucky with injuries will he sacrifice the team for individual development."
reddevils,3dkp49,RedDevil237025,6,Fri Jul 17 01:49:51 2015 UTC,"I don't expect Wilson and Januzaj to be as good as Ronaldo, but I think they could reach the Rooney's level. Remember how Januzaj performed the first year? I don't understand how and why Januzaj stagnated last year. Do you think it's because LVG put too much restriction on him?   Also, I always felt, when ever I see Adnan play, that he's a natural no. 10, rather than a winger. Could it be that we are playing him in the wrong position?"
reddevils,3dkp49,reddevilsruled08,34,Fri Jul 17 01:55:43 2015 UTC,"I would just like to point out that I feel like you are underestimating Rooney. Rooney can do things many other players in the world cannot. Honestly, if he could've sorted out his fitness issues and wasn't played in every position possible, everyone would have a complete different view of him. I mean this guy is going to break United and England's scoring record! I feel like the fact that he's been playing for so many years dulls our appreciation for him. If Adnan or Wilson can emulate Rooney, it would be great news for the club."
reddevils,3dkp49,Dry_Oasis,6,Fri Jul 17 02:03:48 2015 UTC,"Well, we don't know what's ahead. I didn't mean to underestimate Rooney. Despite what people or media says, Rooney has fulfilled his potential, in my view, he just didn't have the talent of Ronaldo or Messi to reach their level.  It's been long time since a kid became a star at United. There's more beautiful in football than kids becoming stars, it's like seeing a baby grow up. :p"
reddevils,3dkp49,reddevilsruled08,3,Fri Jul 17 02:09:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure I agree with that. Rooney and Ronaldo were both here as eighteen year olds, and at that point Rooney clearly had the most natural talent of the two."

reddevils,3dkp49,pcaming,2,Fri Jul 17 06:45:17 2015 UTC,"Rooney's level definitely more within reach than Ronaldo's I agree with you.  Build up play under LVG is more about following a system. Requires players to stop playing ""instinctively"". If you've played yourself I'm sure you feel as you grow older you tend to see more options on the field. The experience allows you to see a move or two ahead of time. The Dutch have been able to teach that properly from an early age. At this point Adnan sees a couple of options (1. beat man to byline + cross, 2. Cut inside try get a shot / 1-2 with nearby player) .Januzaj will not only need to develop individually and really find out what kind of player he is but also learn the ""philosophy"".   I don't think he's natural 10. I don't remember too many instances of him setting up others, finding space between lines etc. A left footed typical no 10 would be David Silva (plays for the wrong team unfortunately). I believe AJ is very much in the Robben mould. Caveat : I do need to see him this season and then we'll truly find out how he's evolving.  While we're on this topic. Depay has a very high ceiling. Dutch (been trained a certain way to think), physically dominant. He's already a few steps ahead."
reddevils,3dkp49,RedDevil237025,2,Fri Jul 17 02:13:12 2015 UTC,The reason why I thought Adnan seems better as no.10 is after seeing him for the reserves. I think for the reserves he often played as no.10 or CF and he scored very frequently and made goals as well.
reddevils,3dkp49,greatGoD67,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:17:06 2015 UTC,ery frequently and made g   I;ve seen highlights. TBH he looked faster than Bale against reserve level competition. But maybe he's been played there to develop a certain part of his game. Let's see how his career path goes. I hope he manages to stay with us.
reddevils,3dkp49,devilsway,41,Fri Jul 17 02:22:04 2015 UTC,I would like for Wilson to do for United what Kane did for the Spurs this season.

reddevils,3dkp49,Vetro777,3,Fri Jul 17 02:30:50 2015 UTC,"It's like what Real Madrid did, Chicharito played for them when Bezema was injured.   You can't have good players sitting on the bench all the time, can you? Also, we need to give youth a chance, don't you think? What about other players stepping to recover the loss of Rooney? Do you think it's healthy to rely on Rooney so heavily?"
reddevils,3dkp49,the_red_hope,3,Fri Jul 17 02:35:48 2015 UTC,"The difference is that even though Madrid played Chicharito, they still had Ronaldo and Bale playing next to him."

Madrid is totally different because they have Ronaldo banging in 40+ goals a season.   Give youth a chance by all means, but it shouldn't be our only option and it certainly shouldn't be relied upon! Two domestic cup, the league and a champions league. Potentially 50+ games. Another striker us a must now. No way would any club challenging for trophies go with one proven striker and a youth player. Even if Depay goes more central, that won't happen over night.    Also, you aren't relying heavily on Rooney, you are relying on an unproven youth player. LVG didn't rate him enough last year to give him game time and, lets be honest, our strikers weren't great at all last year."

reddevils,3dizuf,T11PES,3,Thu Jul 16 17:40:28 2015 UTC,Good price? On the back of one bad season? Everton have bagged a real bargain getting him at this price and had we sold a season ago we'd be expecting more than twice this sum. He might not be the best in the world but he'll be a real asset to their squad and almost certainly first choice at the back for them.

reddevils,3difdn,danc906,36,Thu Jul 16 15:20:48 2015 UTC,"I really don't think that's a bad deal at all.  The guy scored 1 in 2 the past three seasons in the PL for Aston Villa, legitimately the least creative side in the league. So he's Premier League proven and not a one season wonder.  He's extremely well rounded, incredible in the air, strong, reasonable quick, decent on the ball.  He's only 24 and is a starting Belgian International.  Also he's a striker and strikers costs a lot. £32.5m is a fair price for him, I really don't understand why so many people don't rate Benteke, he's a very solid striker and is still young and £32.5m doesn't buy you any better than solid where Prem Proven strikers are concerned."

I'd put Benteke max 15 million until he has another 18 goal season, Lukaku was cheaper after 2 consistant seasons from a club that could squeeze a lump of coal into a diamond"
reddevils,3difdn,MullerReus,18,Thu Jul 16 18:37:20 2015 UTC,"He's worth way more than £15m, what bollocks.  £15m is nothing for a striker"

I wouldn't be comfortable offering anything over 15 million until I know he's back,  yes he scored a  hattrick but that doesn't make him worth 32 million does it?"
reddevils,3difdn,MullerReus,8,Thu Jul 16 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"If Fellaini, Herrera, Firmino and Shaw are worth around £30m then he certainly isn't worth £15m.   This isn't 2002. £15m doesn't buy you a proven PL goal scorer. £25-30m for a proven PL 1 in 2 striker is a fair price"
reddevils,3difdn,JuanRiquelme,0,Thu Jul 16 21:04:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not comparing them, Herrera was always going to be overpriced being from Bilbao, Fellaini was a panic buy, Shaw got the english tax on top of a good season and being so young and I haven't seen Firmino play so I can't comment on that, I still think It's too much, they could have went for Bacca who's after coming off a great season for cheaper his age wouldn't matter seeing how much youth the Liverpool squad possess already."

reddevils,3dl5u0,eluuu,3,Fri Jul 17 05:48:18 2015 UTC,"Don't think he will unless we are burdened with injuries. Completely converting a players position successfully at this level is rare.

reddevils,3dl5u0,nickooj,3,Fri Jul 17 05:49:08 2015 UTC,"Depay as a striker. Hypothetical situation: Rooney gets injured, Wilson didn't make an impact and Hernandez hasn't recovered since his collar bone injury.  Depay steps up because Young is still in form with Di Maria (or Mata) on the opposite flank with Depay as a false 9. The new Messi is born."
reddevils,3dl5u0,nickooj,2,Fri Jul 17 11:25:37 2015 UTC,"I think we have enough cover for everyone to play in their preferred positions. Valencia of course already made the switch to RB. McNair, as covered in the press conference, will stay as a CB. I see Di Maria possibly shifting out to RW with a Depay/Young rotation at LW. Herrera will probably play less of a box-to-box role like he had to last season and play a more creative advanced role now that we brought in Schneidi and Schweini. That's how I see it."
reddevils,3dl5u0,TheMathsDebater,2,Fri Jul 17 05:25:55 2015 UTC,I didnt mean out of necessity. Is there anyone in our squad who is better suited at a different position but doesnt know it yet ??
reddevils,3dl5u0,nickooj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:36:19 2015 UTC,"Oh right right.. I think Di Maria is actually better at LCM then on the wings but I do see LVG keeping him on the wings due to his inability to keep possession. And with the midfield so packed, it's even more unlikely that will happen.  Probably mentioned alr, but either of Januzaj or Depay could play up front if Rooney somehow isn't available."
reddevils,3dl5u0,TheMathsDebater,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:52:14 2015 UTC,"Herrera's ability to create is overrated, I think he'll still play B2B next season as he's quality defensively."
reddevils,3dl5u0,nickooj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:08:27 2015 UTC,You think so? You may be right.. But he's definitely more creative than Schneiderlin in my opinion. And Schneiderlin likewise is probably better defensively to be in that B2B. Only possibility I see is Schweinsteiger being played in the advanced role but not too sure about his pace right now.
reddevils,3dl5u0,kartwose,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"Ye, if you watch him he doesn't contribute to the creation of chances that much, although his technique is quality. I'd definitely agree with that, but maybe we'd play a 433 with Schweinsteiger sitting DM, Schnedierlin as a sort of normal CM and Herrera slightly ahead in a B2B/creater role. Only think is Schneiderlin really needs to work on his attacking play, like his shooting."
reddevils,3dl5u0,prehighcrap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:29:34 2015 UTC,I think LVG trusts Herrera to be our most advanced of the trio. Or at least I hope he trusts Herrera over Fellaini. But I think he was a huge creative presence for Bilbao before he came over so we'll see how he does this pre-season.

reddevils,3dihg2,inu50kza,80,Thu Jul 16 15:20:37 2015 UTC,"A lot of people have spoken at length about LvG's presser being ""worrying"" in some way. They talk about how it's petty, unstatesmanlinke, I believe ""shocking"" was in the title of a highly upvoted discussion post about it.  Ridiculous. I feel like a lot of fans didn't watch Fergie's pressers regularly and have only started watching them starting with Moyes if even that early.   This is business as usual for our club over the last 3 decades. Being ruthless, manipulative, airing dirty laundry is fairly par for the course at our club. SAF had no hesitation in throwing players who didn't buy into his philosophy out, he didn't tolerate players questioning his authority.  Whether it's good or bad is for you to decide but it's perfectly in line with our traditions. Personally, I quite like it. Less tactful than Fergie but I like LvG's brutal honesty and transparency."
reddevils,3dihg2,wharsmetoothpicson,-8,Thu Jul 16 15:24:23 2015 UTC,"There's a difference though. Ferguson knew exactly when to use the press if it was to his advantage or when to keep things in house. I don't see what upper hand or advantage there is to be gained from LVG slamming Valdes in public over not playing a reserve game. Scholes refused to play in a league cup game but that wasn't dragged out by Fergie in a press conference, it's petty & unnecessary.  edit - I still can't find any evidence of Fergie ripping into a current player in public and saying he wasn't wanted at the club, anybody got links?"
reddevils,3dihg2,Bradddtheimpaler,53,Thu Jul 16 15:36:58 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, this is really obvious.  Valdes is a sacrificial lamb for the sake of team unity.  We've got four new first team players in.  I think it's a warning to the new guys and everyone else.  Buy in, commit, perform the role you get, or things will go poorly for you here."
reddevils,3dihg2,sawmeal,27,Thu Jul 16 15:46:01 2015 UTC,I like to think that Van Gaal is this amazing mastermind at press conferences and every word he uses is deliberate and calculated.  But it's more likely that it was a heat of the moment thing and he just spoke his mind about the Valdes situation. We're probably overanalyzing every little snippet we hear on the news
reddevils,3dihg2,wharsmetoothpicson,3,Thu Jul 16 16:05:20 2015 UTC,"I can understand that theory and it makes sense but still, why in public? The same message can be conveyed to the squad without the rest of the world being involved. Also OP's assertion that washing our dirty laundry in public is par for the course under Fergie when in fact Utd were notorious for keeping things under wraps for many years, unless there was a major advantage to be had, which in this instance I don't think there's a greater advantage to having all this out in the open."
reddevils,3dihg2,rogues69,9,Thu Jul 16 16:04:37 2015 UTC,Why not? Valdes hasn't made much of a contribution and if Ddg is spending another year he might be unhappy at being second choice again. That could be making him sulk. Who knows. Lvg got him here and if he wants rid of him then something must've happened
reddevils,3dihg2,lordmaximus92,-3,Thu Jul 16 16:07:33 2015 UTC,OOOOO. How dare you say something slightly negative about our wonderful club. Get ready for downvotes.  This is a perfectly well reasoned comment and promotes discussion.

Almost identical to LvG's comments to journalists in his pressers.  Not everything SAF did was a calculated mind game, he often just got angry, spoke his mind and this intimidated people. Sometimes just being yourself when you're a dominating, forceful personality is enough to get what you want. SAF and Mourinho are good at ""mind games"" but aren't calculating, Machiavellian, Frank Underwood-esque figures 24/7."
reddevils,3dihg2,wharsmetoothpicson,2,Thu Jul 16 16:09:55 2015 UTC,Fuck that's like getting told off by your grandad
reddevils,3dihg2,Mekkah,2,Thu Jul 16 19:50:34 2015 UTC,"I don't have a problem with LVG going off on journos or ranting or anything like that, Ferguson did that plenty of times but when it came to discussing individual players or the squad he was rarely off the cuff. The Rooney press conference was completely out of the ordinary because he felt the player & agent were driving the narrative, he wanted the club to take control of the situation & force Rooney's hand which is totally understandable. The thing with Valdes is that there was nothing coming out from his side at all, LVG didn't need to react or have everything spill out the way it did, I can't see a greater advantage of dealing with in the press than dealing with it behind closed doors."
reddevils,3dihg2,mistah_michael,3,Thu Jul 16 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"I'm confused here, because he didn't oust him to the press until it seems certain he is leaving.

It seems perfectly honest, and should show that senior players are not above what he asks, or you are out."

reddevils,3dihg2,sparta41,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:46:59 2015 UTC,"I wasn't 'comparing Scholes to Valdes' I was equating one situation with another, it isn't right for any player to refuse to play a game regardless of their status or relationship to club. In fact Scholes' offence was probably worse as it was a first team game and he's admitted numerous times since that he probably should have been sacked. But my point is Ferguson didn't announce it at a press conference and in fact I don't think he's spoken about it publicly at all, there are very few instances where Ferguson ever came out and had a go at one of his own players publicly regardless of their disciplinary issues."

reddevils,3dihg2,SlappyBagg,2,Thu Jul 16 16:51:47 2015 UTC,"If Fergie was still manager I have no doubt he would have continued his great form.   This gets said a lot but RVP was losing his form towards the end of 12/13. In the first half he'd bang in goals for fun but after his goal drought and during it he would miss about 3 or 4 easy chances for every goal he scored. It was clear he was on the down from then on, where he just wasn't consistently getting them on target like you expected him to."
reddevils,3dihg2,SonnyisKing,3,Thu Jul 16 17:03:13 2015 UTC,Exactly. He's just been injured all the time. Would Fergie have some magic medicine that would keep him fit??

reddevils,3dihg2,R961ROP,6,Thu Jul 16 19:37:20 2015 UTC,what was fergie's purpose of this conference? to show rooney who the boss is? I remember how Rooney was not the most mentally professional player back then
reddevils,3dihg2,PacifisticJ,20,Thu Jul 16 16:24:02 2015 UTC,"Rooney had gone to Fergie privately and said that he wanted to leave. Rooney's agent wanted to get him a better deal. Rooney thought that he could scare Fergie into giving him a better deal if Fergie thought that Rooney was serious about leaving. Instead, Fergie goes public with the knowledge. Rooney shits his pants. Control shifts back to Fergie. Rooney signs new deal.  Fergie then looks to replace Rooney. Stage 1 is Kagawa. Stage 2 is Lewandowski. Fergie retires before Lewa comes. Remember at the end of Fergie's tenure Rooney didn't feature? It's because Fergie recommended that he be sold whilst he still had contract to run - therefore United get some money for him."
reddevils,3dihg2,R961ROP,10,Thu Jul 16 16:46:20 2015 UTC,"People like to blame SAF (I blamed him too) for leaving the club in such a dire state, but the fact is his time here was ended abruptly and he wasn't given a chance to leave a well-built world class team. You can't blame SAF for leaving 2 years early because his wife fell ill. We wouldn't be in this situation right now if SAF left 2 years later and then got in Moyes."
reddevils,3dihg2,PacifisticJ,13,Thu Jul 16 17:01:09 2015 UTC,"Fergie left the club as champions and as serious contenders for the champions league. I don't buy that he left the club in dire condition. He left the club with an insurmountable challenge: replacing Fergie. Man's a genius that took a team to the zenith that was, under any other manager, useless."
reddevils,3dihg2,R961ROP,9,Thu Jul 16 17:06:15 2015 UTC,We won with a second tier team with a world class manager who understood the league better than another. That's why we won IMO.
reddevils,3dihg2,Trickybuz93,3,Thu Jul 16 17:11:47 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah, that's what I'm saying. The fact is that it wasn't a second-tier team with him at the helm. Moyes and LvG revealed that to the world. No one realised how important Fergie was until he was gone."

Ferdy, Vida, Giggs, Carrick, Evra, van Persie, Valencia, Rooney (sort of) were all either at their peak or past their peak.  Basically the only youthful first team player that could really be used as a future base was De Gea (who obviously has had 2 stellar sseasons since).

reddevils,3dihg2,saltymuffaca,12,Fri Jul 17 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"Everyone seems to be agreeing with van Gaal here and criticizing Valdes for being unprofessional but have been quick to forget that Rooney was perhaps even more unprofessional by going public with his first gripe, something which Valdes didn't do until he was goaded into it.   First off, Rooney publicly stated that he didn't have any interest in moving abroad, meaning he would have almost certainly joined one of our main rivals. People will argue that his first transfer request was in the best interests of the club as he was trying to stimulate transfer activity (source: http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/6456970/rooney-reveals-exit-reasons).  However, his second informal transfer request hinged on a lack of playing time in his preferred position (source: http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11667/8709526/wayne-rooney-has-put-in-a-transfer-request-to-leave-manchester-united), due in part to the investment in RvP - the investment he was crying out for during his first transfer request!  Rooney is 100% looking out for himself, which is fair enough, but he is certainly not a man driven by a love for the club. Just something to bear in mind before revering him and slamming Valdes.  Edit: Grammar/corrections."
reddevils,3dihg2,Ceist,2,Thu Jul 16 16:48:10 2015 UTC,I thought he never actually put in a second transfer request?
reddevils,3dihg2,saltymuffaca,3,Thu Jul 16 17:27:14 2015 UTC,"Apparently he didn't lodge an official written transfer request, but Ferguson stated that this was for financial reasons (by doing so he would forgo some signing on fees etc.). The consensus is that he did ask to leave and asked not to be considered for a Premier League match as a result. Technically you're correct in that he didn't go public twice; Fergie outed him the second time. I've edited my post to be more accurate.  Quotes from Fergie to Sky Sports: ""This is the nub of it: in the regulations, in your contract, if you write a letter and ask away or say you have asked away, you lose all your signing-on fees.  'He has never admitted that and never put in a written transfer request, which is what he has been sore at."""

reddevils,3dihg2,Trickybuz93,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:25:22 2015 UTC,"He also makes it clear that the doors still open for Rooney, strokes his ego a bit and appeals to his long standing relationship with him (he points out they've never argue before and emphasises that fact), and what's more makes Rooney look like a bit of a tit. His body language and tone of voice was that of a disappointed father / mentor, not of an angry guy (although you can be sure as shit he was fuming). Calculated to a T.  You can't compare the Valdes sitch to this as this thread tries to do. The relationship isn't the same (even given their history), and LVG seems to have come from a place of anger (ie. not calculated). Love the guy but this was a bit of a hot headed thing to do (not that Fergue wasn't occasionally hot headed)."

reddevils,3dihg2,Takley,-15,Thu Jul 16 17:56:25 2015 UTC,"I'd have been happy to see him leave second time he asked to go. He's not a top player any more and hasn't been an effective, driving force in the team for years.  Many fans are clouded by nostalgia of performances from when he was the main man, but 'passion' (ie running around and shouting) isn't justification for keeping him in the first team, nor are excuses for him being played out of position.   “He'll score 20 goals next season and you’ll love him again”, I’ve heard a few say and no doubt I'll be told that again, but honestly, when he scores I just wish it was someone else putting it in. It genuinely pains me that he’s going to go down in history as our top scorer instead of Bobby Charlton, a man who lives and breathes United and has done for almost his entire life. Rooney, you get the impression, lives and breathes United through an artificial oxygen supply, using it only when necessary in order to survive.   We're stuck with him now though either way. He's too old and too out of form to ever command a big transfer fee somewhere else."
reddevils,3dihg2,LiamRS24,15,Thu Jul 16 15:28:12 2015 UTC,Hasn't been an effective driving force ?  Are you even watching the right team ?

reddevils,3dihg2,kharma45,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:36:34 2015 UTC,Sigh. The undervaluing of Rooney's contribution to the team over the years despite his brainfarts absolutely baffles me.

reddevils,3dihg2,SomebodyReasonable,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:12:15 2015 UTC,"Making the right runs and occupying the right spaces is fantastic but should they come at the expense of basic ball control and quality in the final third? It's not as if you have to have serious pace or mobility to do what Rooney did that Nev and Carra highlighted, just your average footballers ability to run and a functioning brain. He did well with the Mata assist mind.  I think the tactical analysis is way overboard and exaggerated in Rooneys favour. For the majority of games the players will have their instructions and should carry them out that's par for the course. Fair enough Neville is highlighting Rooney and his role and how important it was in the tactical battle and how well disciplined he was, but the fact is his on the ball his hold up play is sub standard. Any credit for Rooneys tactical role should be heavily weighted in the favour of our management team and only small credit to Rooney for carrying it out.  Go back and watch the first 20 mins of that game and see what Aguero did. He was marked out of the game later but he did more in those 20 mins that Rooney managed the whole match."
reddevils,3dihg2,kharma45,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:58:36 2015 UTC,"Well, to be fair, you did ask for an articulation of positives Rooney gives to our play. I intended to deliver on that challenge, not to paint Rooney as the alpha and omega of strikerdom. I agree with many of the criticisms you level at Rooney, but I do think he's got more to offer than you're willing to grant him."
reddevils,3dihg2,LiamRS24,2,Thu Jul 16 18:05:18 2015 UTC,"And that's fine, it doesn't mean I have to agree with the analysis. Good at least though you contributed to a debate rather than just mindlessly downvote which I do appreciate.  This year will be... I don't want to be hyperbolic and say pivotal, but he should be back to being a full time striker again so if he can't bang them in this year with a quality midfield behind him I'd worry a lot."
reddevils,3dihg2,kharma45,5,Thu Jul 16 18:10:42 2015 UTC,I can easily articulate what he does for United but there's no point explaining it to someone who can't grasp the phases of play in football.  An easier response still would be to remind you that he's about to be the 2nd highest premier league goalscorer of all time.
reddevils,3dihg2,kharma45,-1,Thu Jul 16 15:46:06 2015 UTC,"If it's so easy let's hear it. I would've agreed with you 4 years ago.   Yes getting to second is great when he's been playing in the PL for over a decade and has had a monopoly on our set pieces since Ronaldo has left. You'd be worried if any striker was at a club like United for over a decade and couldn't reach those levels. Averaging a goal every 2 games is a great record on paper, don't get me wrong, but those fantastic exploits were in years previous."

When they were first bought by Roman it seemed like they were just his new toy and eventually he would get bored.  They have truly developed a sustainable model now from the ground up. The way they sack managers is still questionable, but I think this will change with Mourinho's new era. They have built up a pretty good foundation and have a vision that can be taken seriously now. Far different from the way City seem to be operating.  Two things in particular; I like the way they have managed to handle their business in the transfer market, also developing good resale for their players.   Most notably though I am super impressed with the young players coming out of their academy. You take a look at the likes of Solanke, Izzy Brown and Loftus Cheek and some of them have been at the club since 8. I think they probably have one of the best academies in England at the moment, it's a topic I want to eventually post on here for discussion as I'm concerned our ability to develop young players is slipping."

reddevils,3dk6wh,obihaive,3,Fri Jul 17 01:37:46 2015 UTC,"XBMC stands for X Box Media Centre. You can guess where its origins lie, but it can be installed on many things - as an app on phone or tablet; on a Pi; on a laptop/PC/media centre (like a NUC/Brix) as a program, or as a dedicated OS using a distro. XBMC has been renamed Kodi within the last year as the X Box part is no longer pertinent, or at least nowhere near as much as it used to be.  Kodi is a media centre for organising, navigation and playback of YOUR media. Much can be changed about it from the skins (essentially themes) to functionality enabled by installing additional plug ins/add ons. You can add plug ins/add ons from different repositories. For example, I mostly use Kodi as a nice interface to browse and play my movies, video, TV series, and music videos. XBMC/Kodi has also gained a reputation for enabling piracy too, which isn't entirely fair as it's not its intended purpose but, unfortunately, it is what it's best known for.  So, heading back to those repositories... While the official XBMC/Kodi community does not support the more nefarious side of what Kodi is used for, nonetheless there is a wide community that uses Kodi for other things. You won't find these other add ons in the official Kodi repositories. These add ons may do anything from streaming BBC iPlayer or being an emulator to things like phoenix/genesis/1channel/SportsDevil, from which you can stream the latest movies, TV, or sports (including live).  Many people rave about it but frankly I find it more trouble than it's worth. Aside from the moral and legal aspects of piracy, it can just be a right pain in the arse to find a stream of decent quality which doesn't drop out or have awful sync issues. Doesn't help that my broadband often seems to think it's a 56kbps modem either, but that's what I get for daring to live slightly rural only 60 miles from London. With a decent internet connection and some detective work into what are the better options these days then YMMV. Some people are very, very happy with it - then again, if they save themselves paying over £100 a month to Sky (for arguably a lesser service) then I'm not surprised they're happy enough to put up with some inconvenience from time to time.  If all of what I wrote above looks like gibberish to you and you're not too comfortable digging around in applications and their settings, it may be easier for you to just go for an off the shelf version such as TVMC. This guy has some easy guides for all sorts to do with Kodi https://seo-michael.co.uk  IPTV is different again. Looking like it's the way forward. I need to look into IPTV myself..."
reddevils,3dk6wh,obihaive,3,Fri Jul 17 10:36:23 2015 UTC,"To add further:  If you're using an android device then by all means install Kodi and set it up how you want, or install something like TVMC if you want to go the dodgy route. Mobdro is another android app for sports. I find it hit and miss for streaming, although it'll cover Sky Sports to NBC and much more.  I don't install any of this stuff on a device on which I keep highly personal or important information, as I don't trust any of this stuff. Piracy is not usually the home of peace and love beatnik philanthropists. I have never knowingly had a security issue using Kodi with dodgy add ons, showbox, mobdro or the like, but none of the devs of these alternatives to paying for content are doing it out of the goodness of their own heart, so bear that in mind."

reddevils,3dj7kh,A_hiccup,104,Thu Jul 16 18:30:29 2015 UTC,Don't want Cavani and don't want ADM to leave.
reddevils,3dj7kh,Izaakf,15,Thu Jul 16 18:31:11 2015 UTC,It's up to Di Maria as to what he wants to do   If we're being pedantic it's not up to ADM either but rather if United are willing to negotiate a transfer.
reddevils,3dj7kh,SluDge1,8,Thu Jul 16 18:34:15 2015 UTC,Unrelated: but i wish people wouldn't delete there comments just because they are afraid of down votes.  They literally mean jack shit and just lead to everyone having the same opinions because they are afraid to lose karma saying what they think.
reddevils,3dj7kh,The_Renovator,7,Thu Jul 16 18:37:55 2015 UTC,There are 60 million reasons to stand in his way.  Obviously the club will do what's in their best interest but to suggest that ADM holds all the cards simply isn't true.
reddevils,3dj7kh,SluDge1,6,Thu Jul 16 20:41:10 2015 UTC,if they see that the offer is acceptable.    sooooo United have a say in this? lol
reddevils,3dj7kh,SluDge1,3,Thu Jul 16 18:41:13 2015 UTC,Have you read your posts?  My understanding was that you are saying that if ADM wants to leave - he will.  What I was pointing out is that it's more complicated than that.
reddevils,3dj7kh,SluDge1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"Obviously if United think l the offer is acceptable they'll let him go, otherwise we won't (de Gea is the perfect example of this). It doesn't look bad for the club to not want to sell a player on a four year contract after just one season... If anything it looks bad on the player If he pushes for the move."
reddevils,3dj7kh,ManUToaster,2,Thu Jul 16 18:54:57 2015 UTC,"I know.  I think if ADM wants to leave he should, but, if he still feels he has something to prove, I'd love to see him stay and prove it."

reddevils,3dj7kh,ohyou123,30,Thu Jul 16 19:01:37 2015 UTC,"If we get £50 million + for Di Maria I don't think it'd be too terrible of a deal, assuming we use the money wisely. As much as I love Angel since his Benfica days, I just don't think he fits in LvG's ideas for the future.   If he was a consistent winger it'd be perfect, but he's not. As a CM he doesn't help defend a lot and is too much of a high risk player, instead of playing it safe like LvG wants. Don't get me wrong, I think having a high risk high reward player like Di Maria can be a good thing, but the manager clearly doesn't think so.  Regarding Cavani, I don't like him that much. I think this season will be crucial to decide if Rooney should remain the club's starting striker or if we should go for a high profile striker to replace him. For now, a back up striker is needed, not a high profile one like Cavani."
reddevils,3dj7kh,omegaxLoL,19,Thu Jul 16 18:35:28 2015 UTC,"He deserves a 2nd season no matter what they're offering. He had a string of great games. Flair, Pace and final ball - he is all Man Utd. Get his family settled and get him Otamendi to keep company with Rojo. Even if he is unhappy, we should convince him to stay for another season, if it still doesn't work out then we let him go. There is a dearth of quality wingers and I don't know who we can replace him with.   Don't agree with the high risk point. LVG has always preferred his wingers to take risks. He even said that in a press conference once. Since our midfield was on the low side last season we had to take less risks but with a stacked midfield right now he would have all the freedom he could ever want."
reddevils,3dj7kh,wr712,12,Thu Jul 16 18:44:28 2015 UTC,He had a string of great games.    Not a very long bit of string mind.
reddevils,3dj7kh,kharma45,8,Thu Jul 16 18:44:02 2015 UTC,"Well, he got injured."
reddevils,3dj7kh,wr712,7,Thu Jul 16 18:51:28 2015 UTC,Still managed to feature in 32 games last year.
reddevils,3dj7kh,kharma45,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:39:39 2015 UTC,He deserves it he might not want it.
reddevils,3dj7kh,northy014,3,Thu Jul 16 18:58:50 2015 UTC,Cavani would just be an expensive Falcao.  Definitely don't want him.
reddevils,3dj7kh,mapguy,7,Thu Jul 16 19:14:13 2015 UTC,Falcao wasn't expensive? Must have cost us about £15m in the fee and wages for just four goals. His 4 goals don't even make up for the £6m loan fee lol
reddevils,3dj7kh,ReflectingGod,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:19:07 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with most of your points. I feel that though Di Maria is class player, he is also a luxury player that is excess to our needs. I'm in no way saying that he isn't great or anything, but would probably want him to leave despite of his quality.  We can definitely use a player instead of Di Maria at this moment though. A player who can play both wing and back up striker, someone with confidence playing the big games, and someone who doesn't fall to the ground on every tackle (again not shitting on Angel). A player of that sort is important because we sold RVP and don't have Falcao this season either. Rooney will need to rotate, sure Wilson and Chicharito are available, but I wouldn't trust them to play primary striker in case Rooney gets injured. I feel someone  like a Cavani / Muller / Lewandowski would be amazing replacement for Di Maria.   Majority of this sub hates the idea of getting Cavani and don't think we could get Muller or Lewandowki, which is why I said someone like them. I feel Aubemeyang or Lacazette would be great options. What are this sub's thoughts?"
reddevils,3dj7kh,red_devilforever,6,Thu Jul 16 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"Problem is that you want a striker to replace a winger/CM. From the names you mentioned only Muller and Aubameyang have played on the wing with success, and I doubt Bayern/Dortmund are willing to sell them. Not to mention the other names you mentioned wouldn't be happy sitting on the bench, but neither would Rooney. Meanwhile, playing Rooney at CM is also less than ideal, but hopefully that's dead after our latest signings.  Right now, I feel a back up striker is more important than a high profile one. After next season where we'll know if Rooney still fits the role for our main striker position, then I think we should go for a high profile striker, depending on Wayne's season."
reddevils,3dj7kh,omegaxLoL,2,Thu Jul 16 19:22:19 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree with not getting a high profile name, but someone who still has the confidence of banging in goals at the big stage. But you do agree that Aubemeyang would be a good fit in case Di Maria leaves right. I am pretty sure I have heard Lacazette being used as a winger, or that he can play both LW/RW."
reddevils,3dj7kh,red_devilforever,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:57:52 2015 UTC,"I think Aubameyang would be great for sure. Has success playing both on the wing and upfront, but I just don't see Dortmund selling unless it's for big big money. Was crucial to them last season.  Lacazette was played as a winger before but not to great success. Much better as a striker"
reddevils,3dj7kh,omegaxLoL,10,Thu Jul 16 20:05:59 2015 UTC,This guy has a great record on transfer stories before anyone asks.
reddevils,3dj7kh,yiyiyiyi,5,Thu Jul 16 19:46:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Doesn't bullshit at all. I hope we for Felipe Anderson. For the price of Benteke, he will solve ADM and striker issues."
reddevils,3dj7kh,therosepetal,9,Thu Jul 16 19:54:36 2015 UTC,"Felipe Anderson is not ready yet to move to a bigger club than Lazio. With all due respect, he started playing well since december 2014 til march 2015. After that his form was very bad and he's been very inconsistent. Also the president of Lazio will not sell him for less than 40/50 million, he's definitely not worth that"
reddevils,3dj7kh,peduxe,2,Thu Jul 16 20:01:17 2015 UTC,"Hmm. For the number of times I have watched him, he has looked raw with a lot of potential. Definitely not worth that much."
reddevils,3dj7kh,G_Morgan,7,Thu Jul 16 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"It baffles me that no one ever suggests Pedro from Barca, hard worker, finisher instinct and is already proven."
reddevils,3dj7kh,ReflectingGod,4,Thu Jul 16 18:31:23 2015 UTC,Honestly I wouldn't mind Pedro.
reddevils,3dj7kh,peduxe,2,Thu Jul 16 18:33:09 2015 UTC,"Got a buyout clause of £21m also. Apparently Liverpool and Chelsea are leading the race to sign Pedro with Chelsea being favorites after Fabregas reportedly talked him into it. Given we have our own little Spanish thing going on, maybe we could convince him to come otherwise where he'll likely get more guaranteed football. Many Chelsea fans I've seen don't even think he is first team material."
reddevils,3dj7kh,ReflectingGod,3,Thu Jul 16 18:40:07 2015 UTC,"He would be perfect for us, guaranteed goals from either wings, Depay also scored a lot for PSV so I'm still confident he will replicate it. Just the thought of Darmian and Pedro on that right wing would be pretty good in my eyes. We must join in the chasing."
reddevils,3dj7kh,DatGuyRich,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:41:38 2015 UTC,"I can't say I've seen much of him but for what its worth, he'll be a fantastic squad player and is very versatile and for that reason, I wouldn't mind him at the club. He is still young so I expect some inconsistency in his game but we could be talking a world class first team player in a couple seasons to come. If we can get him for no more than £25m, I'd be for the move."
reddevils,3dj7kh,dannyaray89,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"True, doubt we'll accept though unless its a monster offer"
reddevils,3dj7kh,DictatorshipWorks,17,Thu Jul 16 19:22:49 2015 UTC,"In my dreams this deal goes through for over £50m, and we use the proceeds on one of Reus or Griezmann. Never gonna happen, but at least the thought makes me happy."
reddevils,3dj7kh,januzaj_44,14,Thu Jul 16 20:12:46 2015 UTC,I'd take Reus over Di Maria in a pinch and destroy liverpool hopes in the process.
reddevils,3dj7kh,gambit700,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:21:09 2015 UTC,"He won't leave Dortmund this window and certainly not to Liverpool.  If Di Maria leaves we have Mata as first choice, Januzaj as backup and Pereira as third.  I like giving youth a chance and am happy with this.  If ADM leaves we don't need to replace him.  EDIT:  However, if we're talking targets Gaitan and Pedro are definitely both available."
reddevils,3dj7kh,PhilJonesIsTheGOAT,4,Thu Jul 16 20:09:40 2015 UTC,"I'd love Reus, but I don't see him leaving Dortmund this year."

reddevils,3dj7kh,ittihad06,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:40:20 2015 UTC,Either of those would be great! Reus would probably be over £50m. I think we could get Griezmann for much less. They would both be able to assimilate into the squad pretty quickly now that we have players from the German and French NT
reddevils,3dj7kh,kharma45,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:20:20 2015 UTC,Griezmann would be a dream. I started following Depay after the last World Cup and was ecstatic when we showed interest in him and eventually got him. I started following Griezmann around the same time so for me personally this would be amazing if my two favorite non United players joined us in the same window.
reddevils,3dj7kh,ohyou123,7,Thu Jul 16 22:08:09 2015 UTC,B-b-but I kept getting told and saw posted how stupid it was for anyone to entertain the idea that he could leave because of some interview...
reddevils,3dj7kh,DerekL88,9,Thu Jul 16 19:51:59 2015 UTC,Agreed.  The mob downvoting on here regarding Di Maria leaving over the last number of days has been disgraceful. Can we finally start to have a mature discussion on this very real possibility now?  Christ.
reddevils,3dj7kh,D1794,2,Thu Jul 16 20:32:43 2015 UTC,I've never been a big fan of his tbh... loads of talent but just looked uninterested playing for United.  Let the downvotes shower over me
reddevils,3dj7kh,Neville-wears-prada,23,Thu Jul 16 21:16:23 2015 UTC,Don't want Cavani.  I wouldn't be against accepting over £50m for him. He just doesn't fit.
reddevils,3dj7kh,tamasuperstar,8,Fri Jul 17 05:29:51 2015 UTC,"The problem for me would not really be selling Di Maria, the problem is who is going to replace him? Surely we won't play another season with Mata on the wing?"
reddevils,3dj7kh,giraffekisses,11,Thu Jul 16 18:40:48 2015 UTC,Surely we won't play another season with Mata on the wing   Why is this such an issue?  I thought he did really quite well and if he struggles we have great options to come in too in Januzaj/Depay etc.
reddevils,3dj7kh,D1794,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"Because his best position is as a CAM, and at right mid he doesn't take on players. While he did do well in the games when we hit a patch of form, I feel that we wouldn't be enough an attacking threat on the right side, especially since I feel it could be played against."
reddevils,3dj7kh,Neville-wears-prada,8,Thu Jul 16 19:24:01 2015 UTC,"Memphis, Young, Januzaj, Pereira."
reddevils,3dj7kh,peduxe,3,Thu Jul 16 18:33:40 2015 UTC,The plan was for Di Maria to play right wing right? I don't want Mata and Januzaj on the wing for another season. simply not good enough if you want to challenge for the title.
reddevils,3dj7kh,foreverbythyself,6,Thu Jul 16 18:49:26 2015 UTC,"There is no plan, I too never saw Di Maria playing in the right wing and doubt he will be consistent enough in either wings, he thrives better in this roaming midfield position."
reddevils,3dj7kh,AkeemJoffer,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:01:47 2015 UTC,"There was a game, I can't remember against who, but we had both Adnan and Di Maria on the wings and they switched sides about halfway through the first half. So at least at that game he played on the right."
reddevils,3dj7kh,evolution909,2,Fri Jul 17 05:18:59 2015 UTC,"If we lose Di Maria, I'd only be happy if Bale replaced him. I still have a hunch Bale will be a United player by the end of this window."
reddevils,3dj7kh,ohyou123,2,Thu Jul 16 18:51:14 2015 UTC,"Somehow, I never warmed up to him. Rooted for Falcao, though."
reddevils,3dj7kh,Neville-wears-prada,7,Thu Jul 16 18:52:28 2015 UTC,"Never wanted Cavani. But would take Marquinhos, Verratti or Lucas + cash if ADM definitely wants to jump ship."

reddevils,3dj7kh,JMGreaves,6,Thu Jul 16 18:36:18 2015 UTC,50M minimum. His value hasn't deprecated that badly
reddevils,3dj7kh,chutzpahisaword,3,Thu Jul 16 18:45:56 2015 UTC,If he doesn't want to stay here then we shouldn't force him. Everyone is upset because he is a quality player but Van Gaal has shown that he can bring in quality as well. I trust him with the transfer dealings.
reddevils,3dj7kh,thecricketnerd,3,Thu Jul 16 18:47:31 2015 UTC,I'm really worried we're going to get cavani
reddevils,3dj7kh,januzaj_44,4,Thu Jul 16 18:50:28 2015 UTC,Looks like Di Maria is most certainly leaving. I think we will get the sum we paid him for. We should go after Griezman. He can play in the wings as well as Striker.
reddevils,3dj7kh,prehighcrap,4,Thu Jul 16 18:56:15 2015 UTC,We should get someone more right-sided. We only have Valencia as a pacey option on that side.
reddevils,3dj7kh,Leking9,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:37:57 2015 UTC,"We should use Mata with Januzaj as backup, Pereira as third choice.  Give youth a chance and bank £50m, thank ADM for 10 assists.  We are already buying 4 (5 with a CB) first team players.  Overhauling the entire squad is not a good idea no matter how good the replacements.  EDIT:  If we had to bring players in, Pedro and Gaitan are two that are the most available."
reddevils,3dj7kh,ohyou123,2,Thu Jul 16 19:10:12 2015 UTC,Don't want cavani anyway. But if they offer 50m + I would take it if di Maria really wants out
reddevils,3dj7kh,FURyannnn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:43:38 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who wouldn't be happy with £50m for di Maria? Maybe I'm too interested in the finances of the club but I don't think that his value has depreciated by 1/6 over a year. PSG are sounding a bit desperate here and clearly they have quite a bit of cash to spend this summer so we should be able to sell him for a figure close to his original price. Overall, I would prefer if he were to stay but if he really feels the need to leave, it shouldn't be at a cut-price deal"
reddevils,3dj7kh,theatreofdreams21,4,Thu Jul 16 18:37:39 2015 UTC,"I can't understand why people are moaning about Di Maria leaving.  Look, the guy doesn't even want to play for the club. What's the point in keeping someone around that doesn't even want to play for you? Regardless of how good he can be, shouldn't we only be looking at people that actually want to play for us?

reddevils,3dj7kh,dr_pepperpenis,9,Thu Jul 16 18:44:03 2015 UTC,How do you know he doesn't want to play for the club? He's already said he wants to prove himself here.
reddevils,3dj7kh,TweetPoster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:11:41 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that it's more to prove himself for himself rather than for the club. Based on the reports during the transfer and a few of his interviews, it's been kind of apparent for me that he doesn't have a desire to represent United like a lot of the other new players do. In fact, out of everyone at the club, I'd say that he's probably the least invested in United."
reddevils,3dj7kh,ReflectingGod,2,Thu Jul 16 19:14:30 2015 UTC,"Jesus Christ - amount of people happy for us to lose ADM and not get in a world class replacement, along with people who don't think we need another striker (once Chica leaves) boggles the mind. We are Man Utd, not some average-ambition feeder fucking Liverpool level club. Our squad should scare the shit out of other teams. We should be well equipped to challenge for every honour, every season. We're finally putting together a mega squad, possibly the best in my lifetime as a United fan. A dynamic squad, with options, variations and depth, so we can handle all situations from Stoke away on a wet February afternoon to the Champions League blockbuster nights against the worlds best. We have Ed fucking Woodward for Gods sake. And the dutch successor to SAF, doing things the right way. We're finally getting some swagger back. Let's stop this small-time thinking. We're Manchester fucking United!  PS Fuck Cavani, he's a bottler. Much like the Reals/Bayerns/Barcas of this world, I won't cry about ADM leaving if we have a world class replacement lined up."

reddevils,3dj7kh,theatreofdreams21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:30 2015 UTC,"Cavani isn't a bad player and will score goals but he isn't going to score many from the bench where he'll regularly find himself hence why it makes no sense as to why we're linked to him. If we are going to sell Di Maria, we need to get a player to improve upon a current position in return. Marquinhos is the only player I think is really worth taking from PSG, otherwise we should look elsewhere - Müller, Griezmann, Reus etc"

reddevils,3dj7kh,tuananh_org,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:20:52 2015 UTC,It's been pretty clear to me that Di Maria isn't disciplined enough for Van Gaals philosophy and doesn't want to change his game to be that disciplined. It seems like he'd much prefer to go to a place like PSG where he can have the freedom to play his type of high risk high reward game without much scrutiny.   I would personally be happy to see him go for that price. I think it allows us the opportunity to get a player or two that fits the system better.

reddevils,3dhgbq,j0ydivisi0n,73,Thu Jul 16 08:37:07 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call this side of his arrogance a downside. Fergie would've done the exact same thing.
reddevils,3dhgbq,NGU-Ben,26,Thu Jul 16 08:40:24 2015 UTC,"see: how he handled the keane situation. a player does something out of line, he responds in kind."
reddevils,3dhgbq,MisterCroyle,85,Thu Jul 16 08:41:31 2015 UTC,"He dealt with it internally. Fergie never told a player he wasn't wanted through the media. Even with Keane, Beckham or Tevez, things like this were always handled internally.   LVG practically sacked Valdes through the press and then finished the press conference by saying that the press invents lies. I like Van Gaal, but he's far from infallible and has been controversial at his previous clubs for exactly this sort of behaviour."
reddevils,3dhgbq,mocthezuma,33,Thu Jul 16 09:32:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah. Could've dealt with it better AND behind closed doors. Honestly, sometimes we sound a bit like Chelsea fans when we go on like our manager can do no wrong."

reddevils,3dhgbq,honey_pie,10,Thu Jul 16 10:55:09 2015 UTC,This. I doubt Valdes found out he was leaving through this press conference. He's had to know for awhile.

reddevils,3dhgbq,jbiresq,27,Thu Jul 16 15:13:10 2015 UTC,Yeah but Valdes did play in the second team so I was a little bit confused by his comments.
reddevils,3dhgbq,j0ydivisi0n,52,Thu Jul 16 08:45:12 2015 UTC,"He played in the 2nd team, but that doesn't mean he also refused to play in other matches in the 2nd team."
reddevils,3dhgbq,mink_man,21,Thu Jul 16 09:12:42 2015 UTC,"Also just because he played a handful of games, doesn't mean he actually wanted to play them."
reddevils,3dhgbq,Broccli,-1,Thu Jul 16 09:42:43 2015 UTC,"That's easy to understand. Valdes argued with LVG refusing to play, instead of not playing and making a fuss, he played so LVG's comments look wrong."
reddevils,3dhgbq,NGU-Ben,7,Thu Jul 16 08:46:30 2015 UTC,You're telling me he played in the second team last season just in case LVG brought it up and therefore would make him look bad? That seems a bit stupid.
reddevils,3dhgbq,j0ydivisi0n,25,Thu Jul 16 08:48:52 2015 UTC,more likely is that he was asked to play more games than he did and only played against the three he did (three 'big' teams).
reddevils,3dhgbq,MisterCroyle,3,Thu Jul 16 08:50:35 2015 UTC,"Surely the size of the opposition couldn't have had anything to do with it, that would be awfully petty because at the end of the day it's still the reserves in front of a small percentage of the usual audience.  The 3 matches he played were in Jan, Feb and March. There was 7 matches after his last appearance in the 21s, so plenty of time for a refusal then.  Now Dave did have a small blip in form toward the end of the season, I think it was Villa and Everton where he let some soft goals in? Valdes had been itching for a shot for months, it makes sense for him to refuse resigning himself to the U21s at this point and demand a realistic challenge for De Gea's spot. If you're off playing for a different team you're not in the squad, and not being considered. Now obviously considering Dave's ability it seems laughable, but look at it from Valdes's point of view."
reddevils,3dhgbq,kiac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:42:14 2015 UTC,I'd say so. It makes him look like the good guy in all of this. If he sat around refusing to play we'd all be on his back. By playing a few games he's tried to make LVG's comments seem false.
reddevils,3dhgbq,NGU-Ben,6,Thu Jul 16 08:50:14 2015 UTC,"In that case it's good that we have a manager who gives a rat's ass about who is the good and who is bad.  We signed LVG for his philosophy and I trust him on this. A big part of the philosophy is being disciplined and it looks like LVG values both on and off field discipline highly, which is absolutely great for us as a team in the long run."
reddevils,3dhgbq,mufcranter007,4,Thu Jul 16 09:02:42 2015 UTC,"I agree, I've been fairly critical of LVG but I'm with him completely with this and trust his judgment. He's absolutely ruthless and I love it."
reddevils,3dhgbq,NGU-Ben,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:06:53 2015 UTC,"I think rather; he played in some, then refused others.  They were the biggest 3 reserves games we had since Valdes came. He didn't play Norwich, Fullham, Leicester (etc etc).  So either he would only play the biggest games, or he thought after playing a couple he'd get a shot at the first XI-- especially with so many minnows in the FA cup.. and refused when he didn't."
reddevils,3dhgbq,honey_pie,8,Thu Jul 16 10:52:58 2015 UTC,"Keane made it public, Valdes didn't."
reddevils,3dhgbq,wes1eysn1pes,3,Thu Jul 16 08:52:23 2015 UTC,so... valdes didn't just tweet/facebook/instagram that?
reddevils,3dhgbq,MisterCroyle,23,Thu Jul 16 08:55:16 2015 UTC,Keano made his rant public BEFORE he was kicked out. Valdes didn't say a word until LvG decided to shit on him to the press.

reddevils,3dhgbq,MisterCroyle,9,Thu Jul 16 09:10:56 2015 UTC,"Louis' timing is off here. If we are trying to sell the player, why air the dirty laundry in public now? Why not sell him, then Louis can say what he said? This just tips the balance in favour of the buying club by leaking damaging (to Utd's negotiation position), valuable (to the buying club) information."
reddevils,3dhgbq,patrick_k,2,Thu Jul 16 09:41:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed, plus what happens if De Gea actually leaves and Valdes hasn't been sold yet?  Do we push hard for a new keeper? Do we keep Valdes around after this comment?  Not the most professional move by LvG."
reddevils,3dhgbq,emtheory09,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:18:43 2015 UTC,It works sometimes but it also kind of is when it usually leads to him getting the sack. Van Gaal works well for a few years then eventually wears out his welcome.

reddevils,3dhgbq,NGU-Ben,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:34:04 2015 UTC,"Are you talking about the first Rooney transfer request? He announced that because he knew it would give him the upper hand in negotiations, to put public pressure on Rooney not to leave. The second one, when he retired, he came out publicly because he believed Rooney was not worth it (rightly or wrongly) and wanted to push him out of the club.  This situation is different. The club has nothing to gain by LVG talking publicly about Valdes and the club harms its negotiating position. They could have sold him, talked about it later and there would have been no issues."

Obviously we all don't know for certain what is going on but 16 March onward is a huge gap not to be included, which makes me think that this is when Valdes started kicking off a fuss.   However, the concerning thing for me is why he would be included on the first team bench when pulling this shit if it happened within this period. Surely LVG would emit him from the first team squad instead of waiting til summer and dropping him from a tour.   Another glaring question is that if this is the case how severely out of favour is Lingaard?"

LVG is always very positive about our players, always praising them about how hard they work, or how professional they are. I'm sure there is much more going on before LVG would publicly criticise him like that."

If he refused originally but then relented and finally played, that's still a reason to get rid of him, if he's being defiant to the manager.  Honestly if LvG says he refused to play i'm assuming he did, so he needs to go."
reddevils,3dhgbq,dracovich,8,Thu Jul 16 11:40:18 2015 UTC,"Maybe LVG thinks that De Gea is staying, at this point, and when he talked to Valdes about his role for the upcoming season he said he didnt want to play in the reserves."

reddevils,3dhgbq,TMillo,6,Thu Jul 16 08:46:18 2015 UTC,"I respect Valdes for his achievements and I can see why he has responded like this after being hung out to dry by LVG.   On the other hand, he was never going to displace Dave in the first team last year so if LVG wanted him to have practice just incase of injury and he refused that shows a poor attitude"
reddevils,3dhgbq,Het_Bestemmingsplan,3,Thu Jul 16 09:51:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah really, nobody is going to replace a top keeper with someone without any match practice at all."
reddevils,3dhgbq,AC5L4T3R,63,Thu Jul 16 09:16:54 2015 UTC,What LVG said last night left a sour taste in my mouth. He spent a good part of the presser saying he couldn't tell the journos about transfers etc but really hung Valdes out to dry. Seemed really unprofessional from him.   I love LVG and his I don't give a fuck attitude but doing things like that only creates a bad environment. Feeding the mouths of the press.
reddevils,3dhgbq,YoungJump,8,Thu Jul 16 12:28:00 2015 UTC,"I really didn't like that bit, if every transfer is a process (such as Di Maria's possible departure or in-goings) then don't carve into Valdes that way when he's not even really looking to move yet. Had he not said anything like that, we wouldn't have another shitstorm now"
reddevils,3dhgbq,JeSuisLouis,8,Thu Jul 16 08:41:48 2015 UTC,Well the Valdes situation wasn't a process any longer cause decision about his future @ ManUtd had already been made.
reddevils,3dhgbq,hawkinsno2,13,Thu Jul 16 08:49:27 2015 UTC,"I see you make a valid point, maybe LVG shouldn't have been so 'blunt' with the way he went about it. But nonetheless he is the manager. The one who gave him a chance after he left Barcelona. If what LVG says is true then there is no place for Valdes at this club. To compare - I doubt Falcao was particularly pleased about being picked for the U21, but he never openly complained about it on social media."
reddevils,3dhgbq,j0ydivisi0n,30,Thu Jul 16 09:18:00 2015 UTC,Valdes never complained about it on social media? He's literally responding now to comments made by LVG saying he wouldn't play when he did.
reddevils,3dhgbq,hawkinsno2,11,Thu Jul 16 08:46:54 2015 UTC,"Ah yeah sorry, phrased my words badly there. That's what i meant. I still think Valdes is in no position to complain about playing for the reserves/U21. Stature means nothing under a manager like LVG."
reddevils,3dhgbq,hurfery,6,Thu Jul 16 08:50:12 2015 UTC,Lol. That's not what Valdes is doing here. He's trying to make LVG look like a liar. You think just because he played 3 reserve games he never refused to play any of the others?
reddevils,3dhgbq,googly__moogly,6,Thu Jul 16 08:54:26 2015 UTC,Exactly. 3 reserves games over an entire season when you're not playing in the first team is not enough games for any player... What kind of player doesn't want to play?
reddevils,3dhgbq,mahcuz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:40:08 2015 UTC,Well isn't the point that he had more opportunities to play for the reserves but refused them.
reddevils,3dhgbq,patrick_k,2,Thu Jul 16 12:15:31 2015 UTC,Louis' timing is off. See my other comment. This gives negotiating leverage to whoever eventually signs Valdes.
reddevils,3dhgbq,G_Morgan,4,Thu Jul 16 21:03:04 2015 UTC,I doubt we're going to hold whichever club Valdes signs for to ransom.
reddevils,3dhgbq,DerekL88,2,Thu Jul 16 09:44:25 2015 UTC,"I agree.  It's not like we paid X amount of dollars to sign him from someone else.  He was brought in for rehab and signed a short term contract, so I dont think we'll be too concerned with the amount we can sell him for."
reddevils,3dhgbq,hawkinsno2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:26:57 2015 UTC,"Possibly, it depends on how much LVG actually wants to Valdes. It surely wont be much. Many teams will not care about this rift. This is between manager and player. Nothing to do with the club. I guess in this point in time LVG just wants him off the books."
reddevils,3dhgbq,shinkag,2,Thu Jul 16 13:49:18 2015 UTC,"Falcao, RVP, Rafael etc all played for the U21s for a couple of games after returning from injury. It's just how LVG does it, nothing for them to complain about as it's for them to gain match fitness. Valdes was meant to play in the reserves for the rest of the season probably, probably because he just came back from a ACL injury and we had De Gea + Lindegaard."
reddevils,3dhgbq,j0ydivisi0n,4,Thu Jul 16 09:55:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, obviously we don't know the whole situation but I agree LVG really went in on him while leaving bits out on other players. The reasoning didn't make sense either because Valdes has played with the second team and his agent said he wanted to stay."
reddevils,3dhgbq,Het_Bestemmingsplan,2,Thu Jul 16 14:38:53 2015 UTC,Although he might have refused to play other games except those three.
reddevils,3dhgbq,JeSuisLouis,5,Thu Jul 16 08:47:40 2015 UTC,Valdes situation wasn't a process any longer. And i'm pretty confident that Valdes got told he wouldn't joining on the USA tour. It's not like he showed up at the airport just to find out there wasn't a seat booked for him. So Valdes knew in advance and I'm very confident LvG told him exactly why he wasn't wanted anymore. If you refuse to do parts of your job and get sacked because of it you shouldn't complain if these reasons possibly came out. And to then tweet stuff that is ment to question LvG's explanations in the media is just poor.

I don't blame either VG or Valdes but felt the timing of his arrival is wrong, when DDG is performing so well last season. You can't have two Kings conquering the same country. IMO, dropping DDG for Valdes would easily be the wrong decision.   The only problem now that will really fuck us up now is IF DDG leaves."
reddevils,3dhgbq,JeSuisLouis,12,Thu Jul 16 20:28:48 2015 UTC,"Well that Valdes did play in the U21 but refused at some point to play there anymore is a well likely scenario and so Valdes' tweet doesn't make LvG a liar all of a sudden, does it?"
reddevils,3dhgbq,hurfery,8,Thu Jul 16 09:14:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly. There is a complete lack of critical thinking from some posters here. Between LVG and VV, I will believe the one who is always 100% honest."

reddevils,3dhgbq,AyyItsTheFonz,3,Thu Jul 16 12:12:15 2015 UTC,"Valdes is saying he played with the second team in response to what LVG said about Valdes' refusals to play with the 2nd team. Him playing with the 2nd team doesn't mean a thing because if he did refuse and then play (only against 3 teams since January, which also happen to be the 3 big teams), it doesn't change the matter that he refused in the first place."

Closed doors is another matter, one that nobody outside the club needs to hear or see."

Perhaps LVG shouldn't have taken this public but nobody knows what the situation was behind closed doors. Personally I've no issue with making an example of a bad egg.

But fans of every other club he has managed have stated that he does get this way every now and then.  I just hope this all gets resolved quickly and quietly, I still have a great deal of respect for Valdes (and LVG of course), I wish he would have worked out for United."

reddevils,3dhgbq,thecaseace,6,Thu Jul 16 08:32:35 2015 UTC,You're allowed I think 3 senior players in the U21s.  It's also meant as a place to keep vets sharp and regain fitness.

reddevils,3dhgbq,wpmk,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:17:48 2015 UTC,"I think everybody should calm down. LvG dealt with it internally, he's letting go a troublemaker, and the matter has been resolved. By being 100% honest when asked the question he's removing the constant speculation on his absence—the media won't stop. Even if LvG lied and later sold Valdes, the media would realise that they've been told something different.  So what Valdes played a few games for u21s. Even if he refused to play just one one game then he should be let go. The timing of Valdes' Instas is interesting too. He's trying to get fans on his side. If anything it's more disappointing that we gave him a chance and he threw it back into our faces.  We have De Gea. If he goes, we'll get somebody else like we always do. I'm happy."
reddevils,3dhgbq,TheInsaneDane,2,Thu Jul 16 12:21:29 2015 UTC,"Shit, we're gonna' end up with no keepers at the end of this transfer window."

Yes it might seem like blind faith but I think there's more to this whole Valdes issue than we think. Obviously more to it than LVG let on in the press conference. Ultimately, LVG has put his foot down and has done away with Valdes. We don't know enough to make slating comments on either of them, so I just wish Valdes all the best and hope LVG has a clearly mapped out plan for our keepers."
reddevils,3dhgbq,Yeahthatsnotright5,2,Thu Jul 16 13:31:56 2015 UTC,We could have used Valdes' experience in the squad going into the next season (especially with CL). But I am sure he is going to Valencia now where he will have a much better time as a starter. He should have taken part in u21 games knowing that he needs to get prepped just in case De Gea leaves. And LVG shouldn't have disclosed anything public and should have handled it behind closed doors. Both sides of the party were in the wrong and all it ends up doing is putting our club in a bad light. This is no one else's business to know...not even us. This is all just sad after the absolutely fantastic past weekend we had. All I wish now is to encourage everyone on this sub to just stop talking about it. Respect Valdes and LVG and lets move on.
reddevils,3dhgbq,kw9403,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:52:27 2015 UTC,Why make such a big fuss over playing U21s?
reddevils,3dhgbq,Arowski,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:00:31 2015 UTC,"I honestly think LvG already had the Valencia loan deal (plus the option to buy) worked out when he slammed Valdes, all in order to make an example out of him. Sure, it's really harsh, but it falls right under LvG's managerial methods. Valdes will be glad to be off, and LvG will be happy to see him off as well. In the end, LvG gains more respect and the unprofessional Valdes (referring to the tweets) will no longer be a disobedient obstacle for the club."

He doesn't talk about transfers because it can affect negotiations and prices etc. but he clearly wants rid of Valdes and wants to make a clear statement that he does not fit in to the current philosophy at the club because of his behaviour. Why does he need to keep that private? Media will only speculate on it endlessly when he goes on loan or is sold so he might as well make use of it and give it straight - it shows that if you don't buy into what he wants to do, you're out on your arse. Fergie did things that made us look bad in some ways but it was all for the good of the playing squad most of the time."
reddevils,3dhgbq,LucaRiolu493,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:21:39 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why people are criticising LVG here. The press conference was about the tour, someone asked why Valdes wasn't in the squad. LVG wouldn't lie and then later be proven to be a liar when Valdes is sold. So he told the truth, he said Valdes doesn't fit the philosophy. He gave an example of one part of the philosophy that Valdes didn't adhere to and said he was disappointed with the outcome. He didn't take any hits and Valdes, he just stated the facts. We as fans would have wanted to know what happened. This sub has been fretting over our goalie situation for weeks, saying Valdes is the solution, surely we want to know that he's going to be sold so we don't discuss him in our future plans anymore. Also as fans we want to know why he's not on tour, rather than blindly guess as to why he's been omitted from the squad (e.g. many people saying he might be injured or training separately or coaching the youth). Leave it alone, LVG did what was honest and right, he didn't launch any sort of public attack on Valdes.   Valdes shouldn't have tweeted this cryptic shit, if he had something to say to defend himself or clarify the facts, he should say that instead. I'd have much for respect for him then. But right now I don't, because he only played 3 reserve games and seems to think that clears him of any liability for refusing to play other games or expressing his wish to not play for the reserves."
reddevils,3dhgbq,MrPielil,0,Thu Jul 16 18:54:24 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of United, but to see a FANTASTIC goalkeeper get shunned out of a club because he doesn't want to play in the reserves is disgusting.  It shows that he is ambitious and wants to play first team football! Valdes has a winning mentality, coming from Barcelona, something United seem to be lacking ever since Alex Ferguson left.   I just think van Gaal has dealt with this in a poor manner, but Valdez's comments on social media obviously won't help the matter.  For the sake of the public image of your club, I hope it's sorted soon :)   A Gooner :P"

reddevils,3dhgbq,daniam1,4,Thu Jul 16 15:19:53 2015 UTC,"LVG in his press conference yesterday said that the reason Valdes was not on the tour was because he did not fit with the team's philosophy because he refused to play for the U21 team. He also said that the only way for him to go now is out, and that he will be sold.   Valdes' tweet is showing results and a photo of him and the team from the U21 games that he did play, suggesting that he's confused as to why LVG would say he refused to play when he obviously did.   To be taken with a pinch of salt, as the games that Valdes did play were big games in the league against the top teams, so its likely that Valdes refused to play other games that he saw as beneath him.   The thing to remember here is that as part of LVG's method, first team players are expected to play in the U21s when returning from injuries to regain match rhythm. Falcao, RVP, Herrera, Rafael, Evans all did it this season. It's really not LVG's way of snubbing players or punishing them, it's a vital part of his method - which is why he is saying that Valdes didn't 'fit' with the philosophy."
reddevils,3dhgbq,wet4wet4sergio,-1,Thu Jul 16 09:02:05 2015 UTC,Wow! I thought such a decorated and experienced goalkeeper would be a bit more professional!  There's no way he is staying now.
reddevils,3dhgbq,saetarubia,7,Thu Jul 16 09:55:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's the one not being professional.."
reddevils,3dhgbq,Izaakf,8,Thu Jul 16 08:43:34 2015 UTC,"If what LVG said is true then Valdes was unprofessional and LVG has every right to call him out on it. He gets paid well every week, he can't turn around and refuse to do what his boss asks of him."
reddevils,3dhgbq,wet4wet4sergio,4,Thu Jul 16 08:47:55 2015 UTC,"Well,we let him rehab with us and then offered him a big contract, the least he could do is play when he is asked to.  I fail to see how that is being professional."
reddevils,3dhgbq,daniam1,4,Thu Jul 16 09:14:05 2015 UTC,"Valdes is being unprofessional if he's refusing to play in the U21s for his manager.   We've got to keep in mind that Valdes had a long period without playing. IMO, snubbing the chance to play - even if it's just to get back into the swing of things and test himself out again - because he thinks it beneath him is unprofessional. Especially when we've given him a fat contract and the run of our facilities and coaching staff to aid his rehabilitation.   Whether LVG was right to publicly slam him is divisive. Personally I'm OK with it. He's sending a message to the rest of the squad that they must get on board with his methodology and do as he says, or there is no place for them at this club."
reddevils,3dhgbq,j0ydivisi0n,0,Thu Jul 16 09:25:31 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly
reddevils,3dhgbq,j0ydivisi0n,3,Thu Jul 16 10:01:58 2015 UTC,When you're a player and someone attacks your credibility it's hard not to respond in kind.
reddevils,3dhgbq,Feezbull,2,Thu Jul 16 08:51:00 2015 UTC,"That's true. But he also likely knows what LvG was referring to instead now if he did indeed refuse to play some games and all that. So this response was just a defensive act to try and come out looking good when he knows he's the one who caused the issue.   Sure, it was made public now and all and he wants to defend himself. But, the initial stem comes from him if so and he's the one to blame initially as he caused it.   Now this makes it a case of media orgasm as they would devour this to make it seem like one of them was lying when in fact, it's likely LvG meant he played, yes, but after refusing/not playing as and when he was required/etc while Valdes was trying to make it seem like- you said I didn't play but I did!  Play when the manager asked and none of this would've happened. That said, LvG should've not made it public though and just said- oh he's not selected. I don't have to discuss this. Done. Nothing happens as well of this sort."
reddevils,3dhgbq,finerd,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:46:39 2015 UTC,"Out of this, you're getting that Valdes is unprofessional?"
reddevils,3dhgbq,thecaseace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:46:24 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  Van Gaal has explicitly said it.
reddevils,3dhgbq,blamethedrama,2,Thu Jul 16 08:57:50 2015 UTC,i hope LVG and valdes have a heart to heart session and lay all grievances on the table. i would very much like valdes to stay.
reddevils,3dhgbq,thecaseace,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:46:43 2015 UTC,I hope he leaves in the next few days.
reddevils,3dhgbq,Zico568,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:36:02 2015 UTC,I think they should regardless whether he's staying or not. And im surprised they apparently didn't already from what it looks like.
reddevils,3dhgbq,50shadesofcoco,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:45:13 2015 UTC,Wait. I think I'm the only one confused. Why the fuck is Valdes playing U21 when he is older than 21?

reddevils,3dhgbq,mink_man,4,Thu Jul 16 08:35:51 2015 UTC,No one knows the facts so we shouldn't be making judgements on either man.
reddevils,3dhgbq,StannisJr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:51:54 2015 UTC,When the boss tells you to do something you do it. He obviously didn't play in other games he was supposed to and now he's trying to make LVG look bad. I just hope this doesn't disturb the rest of the squad.
reddevils,3dhgbq,_ar76,-2,Thu Jul 16 09:18:42 2015 UTC,"This looks like a shit storm. LVG can be hard on players, but he never would go and say something to the press, like yesterday, if there isn't an actual issue.   Also Valdes didn't have to retaliate in the social media.   This looks bad."

Made the club look bad. Fergie did similar things,  but he never came out and went ""keane acted like a dick, so he's off"". He kept all the mess  in the club. That's proper."

In basketball, it's called being a gym rat. If Kevin Durant walked by you in the park, and you asked him to be the 6th so you could play 3-on-3. he'd join in. Valdes knows DDG is the starter, and should want to keep sharp, plus play the game that he should love."

reddevils,3diyz2,Catawoz,3,Thu Jul 16 17:41:02 2015 UTC,I don't think he will realistically. Shearer was the main man for so long at 2 clubs.
reddevils,3diyz2,spoofex,3,Thu Jul 16 19:04:44 2015 UTC,"It does look a bit tricky, he needs 76 goals to surpass it, he's going to be 30 this October,   if he goes or retires by the age of 33, he would need to average 25 premier league goals but that's something that he has only done twice in his career, but if he retires in the premier league at 35 like Shearer, he'd need 15-ish a season. It's more likely that it isn't going to happen but it's realistically plausible, it pretty much depends on how he is utilized in the coming seasons."
reddevils,3diyz2,Catawoz,2,Thu Jul 16 20:18:57 2015 UTC,"Rooney is a work horse, I can't see him retiring that early, but a move to the MLS would definitely make it a tough goal to reach, especially if he goes so early.

reddevils,3diprz,ohyou123,13,Thu Jul 16 16:38:40 2015 UTC,"I think it was glaringly obvious early on that United didn't want Benteke. There was no secret in relation to his buy-out clause. The whole universe knew how much he would cost from day one and with United letting Falcao and RVP go, Benteke would have already been a United player by now if there was any genuine interest.  This sort of stuff is not uncommon. Agents and clubs will drum up stories about big clubs being interested when looking for more money. Liverpool shit themselves and pulled the trigger when they heard United were sniffing around. Simple as that."

reddevils,3di9n6,ireallyamsomething,42,Thu Jul 16 14:18:24 2015 UTC,"I really didn't at first. LvG's ability to adapt to us as well our ability to adapt to him has been surprising. He's made wholesale changes to the squad as well, with very few instances of unrest behind the scenes (Valdes notwithstanding). Rooney deserves credit too, he's kept his head down. I guess this season is the real test for them both."
reddevils,3di9n6,Atlascantakeit,26,Thu Jul 16 14:29:19 2015 UTC,I had my doubts because I assumed Van Persie would be favoured.
reddevils,3di9n6,mufctez,12,Thu Jul 16 14:22:02 2015 UTC,"I'd say Rooney really stepped up, especially under that terrible season we had under Moyes. He was our major fighting spirit while RVP was rumored to want back to Arsenal.   It seems Van Gaal rewarded him for his commitment to the club and being such a hardworker. As per the reports from last season, Rooney is also behind team talks that helped improve the team's performance."
reddevils,3di9n6,mkenya4t,7,Thu Jul 16 15:24:35 2015 UTC,"I thought they'd get along, but for me the surprise was his relationship with RVP. I feel like RVP thought with him coming in he'd have much more of a central point in the squad, only to have Rooney made captain, and Falcao brought in."
reddevils,3di9n6,BrendonAG92,4,Thu Jul 16 14:54:46 2015 UTC,"Yes I did. They have the same kind of commitment, smartness and professionalism. A good manager would've chosen Rooney for captaincy."
reddevils,3di9n6,AfterNachos,5,Thu Jul 16 15:42:37 2015 UTC,"Yes, he spent almost his entire career under SAF, who rarely ever complained about him. He has grown up a lot since then too, no reason to think he would not get along well with LvG IMO."
reddevils,3di9n6,ReaperX24,2,Thu Jul 16 14:43:47 2015 UTC,I had a feeling they would clash or disagree and the added factor of RVP being there to be favoured over Rooney. But he demands such respect and is so experienced. When I heard Rooney first talk about him I knew it was going to be ok.
reddevils,3di9n6,Broccli,2,Thu Jul 16 14:32:52 2015 UTC,"I was pretty adamant at the time that they would get along. Rooney doesn't have an egotistical personality for one. But secondly, and probably most importantly, Rooney's hero is Jari Litmanen. He's spent years studying and emulating him. Litmanen was perhaps Van Gaal's favorite player to coach. I imagine Van Gaal liked that about Rooney and didn't need to tweak his style as much as some of the other players."
reddevils,3di9n6,theatreofdreams21,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:51 2015 UTC,A younger Rooney would have been out years ago. They're both working together at the right time I think.
reddevils,3di9n6,7B8,3,Thu Jul 16 16:34:23 2015 UTC,"I thought he'd like Rooney as a player but not enjoy his 'character' per say. However making him captain ended up being a great move, one which I have to admit was unsure would pay off. Rooney's really taken to the role though and has been more than prepared to do everything Van Gaal has asked of him. Can't imagine that relationship going much better atm tbh."
reddevils,3di9n6,s_D088z,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:50:46 2015 UTC,I thought that they'd get pretty close fast or Rooney would throw a fit and be sold. Nothing in between
reddevils,3di9n6,SparksV,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:55:55 2015 UTC,Was very surprised my friend. I like many others thought he would be at Chelsea - he has really stepped up his game from leadership standpoint. Bear in mind this is a season where we have lost many leaders in the dressing room.

reddevils,3di9n6,BigCheeser,-1,Thu Jul 16 16:11:35 2015 UTC,If Rooney plays up front this season and doesn't perform then you'd think LVG will try and get him out next summer. Like he's done with RVP.
reddevils,3di9n6,yiyiyiyi,5,Thu Jul 16 15:03:15 2015 UTC,"Can't see it, unfortunately. He's been at the club too long & is captain  he'll have some sort of mentoring type role even if he doesn't start every game."
reddevils,3di9n6,United689908,4,Thu Jul 16 16:56:02 2015 UTC,I dread that and certainly hope that won't happen. But Rooney does offer more versatility compared to RVP which might be a factor.
reddevils,3di9n6,mapguy,2,Thu Jul 16 15:47:51 2015 UTC,"I think it's very likely.  With LvG securing the midfield, Rooney should not be playing anywhere other than striker, where he performs best.  I love Rooney, but if he can't put in 20+ goals this season with the support LvG has for him, he will most certainly go or LvG will buy new talent and Rooney will sit the bench."
reddevils,3di9n6,ritwikjs,2,Thu Jul 16 15:56:53 2015 UTC,"he has a great midfield, good creative wing players in depay and mata.

Yes I am fully aware of his accomplishments but he could take a while to adjust and may not be a star just yet. I love Memphis and was estatic about the signing. What he accomplish before doesn't make him a instant first choice left winger he has to earn it. It should be a fun and friendly competition that will only make both him and Young better!

reddevils,3dntlg,MylesVE,4,Fri Jul 17 20:10:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're missing many players at all. You should be able to see the likes of Rooney, Mata, Depay, Schweinsteiger, and Schneiderlin all in action at some point.  I'd say look out for Depay though, there's quite a bit of expectation around him and he's a very exciting player"
reddevils,3dntlg,colinnisbet197,3,Fri Jul 17 20:07:54 2015 UTC,if I understand what you're asking - Sean Goss maybe? Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair as well as James Wilson.   I'm most excited to see the early stages of players like Memphis and Darmian settling in. Seeing our fluidity and how we work the ball around will be nice too.

The spending LVG did last summer was long overdue, and both he and Moyes should have been left with a much stronger squad than what they were given."
reddevils,3di2u0,TheJoshider10,4,Thu Jul 16 13:36:11 2015 UTC,"I just made a comment regarding that.   People like to blame SAF (I blamed him too) for leaving the club in such a dire state, but the fact is his time here was ended abruptly and he wasn't given a chance to leave a well-built world-class team. You can't blame SAF for leaving 2 years early because his wife fell ill. We wouldn't be in this situation right now if SAF left 2 years later and then got in Moyes.   I'd like to add I don't have any doubt he would have brought in the likes of world class players such as Lewa to the team if he left 2 years later, when he planned to leave. Would have liked to see how Moyes would have managed a team full of quality players instead of Cleverly."

Van Gaal cares not if you are Ronaldo or Messi, you MUST perform in training, you MUST show form at MUFC, even if you have shown form or class elsewhere.  Not sure what I think of that personally, please discuss below;"

reddevils,3dfjcy,tmutton,26,Wed Jul 15 23:16:41 2015 UTC,"Seriously? Did he just expect to come in and start over de Gea? Especially coming off that injury. The reserves would have been great to let him build up his fitness and ingratiate himself in the team by working hard.   I'm shocked, but that seems like truly appalling behavior by Valdes."
reddevils,3dfjcy,Entrepreneur_Girl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:50:10 2015 UTC,With all respect to Valdez he was unlikely to play instead of DDG. The best LVG could do was put him in the reserve games. If he didn't want to play in a reserve/under 21 game then that doesn't look good for him.

reddevils,3dfjcy,TheAgentInTheEast,6,Thu Jul 16 00:22:12 2015 UTC,Exactly. I am very surprised and glad he has stuck with us. I would love to see Lindegaard get more first team chances if and when De Gea leaves.
reddevils,3dfjcy,johnsom3,2,Thu Jul 16 04:47:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm surprised he has too. He is good enough (or at least was--it's been so long since I've really seen him play) to start on other good teams. And no one would fault him if he left. It had to have sucked thinking he was going to replace Van Der Sar only to see the club bring in a new, inexperienced GK while he sat on the sideline through all of De Geas early struggles.   Despite all this, he never has a bad thing to say about the club and, by all accounts, appears to be United through and through.   I doubt he'll ever be our primary GK, but I would love if he was put into a position where he was seeing a lot more games. I get why LVG didn't want to ever drop De Gea this season, but I'm hoping he can do some rotation with whoever our primary GK is (especially with the busy schedule)."
reddevils,3dfjcy,hurfery,16,Thu Jul 16 05:17:22 2015 UTC,Reporter also asked 'Are you selling him?' to which LVG instantly replied 'Yes'. Interestingly LVG also said that he played Valdes in the final game to help him get interest from other clubs.
reddevils,3dfjcy,daprodigyx19,8,Wed Jul 15 22:03:34 2015 UTC,...oops. Had a few moments where he looked like he was waving at his mum while coming for crosses.
reddevils,3dfjcy,DelTrotter,8,Thu Jul 16 00:37:54 2015 UTC,"This isn't him thinking he is bigger than than club. He didn't agree with the role that was offerd to him so he is off. It doesn't have to be personal or one party thinking they are superior, they just couldn't agree on what he could bring to the team. Obviously there is no bad blood between the two."
reddevils,3dfjcy,yiyiyiyi,5,Wed Jul 15 22:31:49 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the video? It wasn't just a simple disagreement. LVG said he was very disappointed in Valdes, especially considering they worked well together before."

reddevils,3dfjcy,Falcoooooo,26,Wed Jul 15 21:54:29 2015 UTC,"Lol, newer really thought about the fact that we had both Falcao and Valdes fighting for a first team spot by playing in our reserves. Imagine your reaction if somebody two-three years ago told you that would happen!"

reddevils,3dfjcy,Stilkonwheels,17,Wed Jul 15 22:51:46 2015 UTC,also fucked rvp over telling him he was past it and would have to leave in front of everyone according to reports.  not only is he being ruthless he's doing it to his people. he really must have hated that 3rd place.   SAF was just as cruel when not winning we just didn't see that side very often.   I think it's because our boys are more used to following the rules due to a career playing under fergies work culture. they know what to do when LvG tells them this is the way we're going to operate.  valdes rvp are too used to prima Donna culture at arsenal and barca and probably found the more schoolboy headmaster dynamic a bit beneath them.
reddevils,3dfjcy,1strwhj,12,Wed Jul 15 21:43:02 2015 UTC,How did he fuck RvP over? Seems to me that he let him know he was past it and wouldn't get the games he wanted so let him head to Turkey. Am I missing soemthing?  I think he's just honest.
reddevils,3dfjcy,Stilkonwheels,46,Wed Jul 15 22:57:18 2015 UTC,RVP absolutely loved playing for Fergie despite his ruthlessness. No way he's a prima donna. His relationship with LVG has also been fantastic. Started most games last year whenever he was fit.
reddevils,3dfjcy,fyodorkafka,9,Thu Jul 16 02:21:20 2015 UTC,"I read somewhere (reckon in Rio's book) that Fergie gave special treatment to RVP, like telling the players to keep on passing to him in training and to make sure they get RVP his first title.  Don't think he ever felt fergie's wrath at full pelt"
reddevils,3dfjcy,inu50kza,5,Wed Jul 15 23:41:02 2015 UTC,He didn't tell them to pass to him to make him feel good. It was because he was the best striker in the league.

reddevils,3dfjcy,TheGhostOfBabyOscar,9,Thu Jul 16 22:58:17 2015 UTC,"Valdes hasn't played for Pep most of his career and during his reign was guaranteed starter. I dont blame him for having an ego at this stage in his career. From the sounds of it by the end rio, giggsy and vidic did too and just refused to do what moyes told them. in his last seasonw ith saf rio was on ery special treatment, constant dialogue with the boss to manage his fitness etc.   rvp got in huge fights when moyes told hm to play when he felt unfit and insisted on having his own med team, his own recovery program and playing when he decided he was fit.  there are no heroes and zeroes here, just an incompatible fit. each makes a legit point. valdes has a rep big enough to throw his weight around and lvg is in a position where that doesnt fit with the culture he wants to instill"

reddevils,3dfjcy,googly__moogly,4,Wed Jul 15 22:05:40 2015 UTC,exactly. the philosophy that you should be ready play for reserves if you are not in the first team lineup!
reddevils,3dfjcy,TheDrySkinOnYourKnee,4,Wed Jul 15 21:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it seems like that's it. When Louis refers to his 'total human being principle' (lol) he really means it. You need to be a team player to play for him."
reddevils,3dfjcy,ballboy007,3,Wed Jul 15 21:53:03 2015 UTC,"Ok, so Valdes is gone, fine, there is only room for one boss in a football team.  However, we've all heard about LvG's 'philosophy' but does anyone know exactly what it is? All I've heard is   Must perform to match standards in training. RB / LB must be able to attack as well as defend, (bomb down the wings).   If anyone knows anything else, please let me know as I honestly haven't got a clue what he means when he repeatedly mentions his 'philosophy'. Do I need to take up Greek?"
reddevils,3dfjcy,rdev1l,4,Wed Jul 15 21:52:36 2015 UTC,"If Valdes leaving means we get Lloris or Oblak in then I would be over the moon and very happy.  But if Valdes and De Gea are leaving and we bring in Romero and Cillessen, then I'm so fking done."

Additionally, judging by his tweet he is more than happy to stay at the club. If he has apologized for his actions I don't see why he has to be sold."

reddevils,3dfjcy,Ethereal-Star,3,Wed Jul 15 23:16:13 2015 UTC,LVG is ruthless. Here we were thinking it was nice for Valdes to get a chance at showing us his capabilities when he played the last game... but in reality he only put him there to tempt potential buyers!
reddevils,3dfjcy,BrendonAG92,2,Thu Jul 16 00:23:23 2015 UTC,I read that in van Gaal's accent.
reddevils,3dfjcy,opacino,2,Wed Jul 15 23:28:39 2015 UTC,Big fan of LVG but this is a little cringe-worthy and certainly classless. Keep it internal and just sell the guy. He's now created a scene where there didn't need to be one due to the fact that Valdes did play in some under 21 matches so to a public with incomplete information it looks as if Valdes has a degree for complaint (not that I think he does).
reddevils,3dfjcy,Gugg256,3,Thu Jul 16 11:27:00 2015 UTC,Shit
reddevils,3dfjcy,opacino,2,Thu Jul 16 14:29:30 2015 UTC,Was looking forward to seeing some more Valdes next season :'(
reddevils,3dfjcy,MylesVE,3,Wed Jul 15 21:44:30 2015 UTC,"To be honest, I'm kind of relieved. While he did win a lot of trophies with Barca, let's not act like he was that amazing of a keeper. For years the fans had complained about him, and were quite frankly a little happy when he moved on.   I hope he moves on to Valencia, or another good sized club and plays well, but at the same time I didn't think he'd fit in with United.   So now we need to see what big Dave wants. If he stays this year, there's a decent chance he'll renew his contract. We have no idea how Real is going to look under Rafa, and United might be the better long term deal. If we don't do that, someone like Leno would be my choice, but ultimately it's down to LVG."
reddevils,3dfjcy,opacino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:48:32 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely ruthless in a bad way. First, we are seeing that LVG has little or no communication with the players. Valdes was surprised about being left out. If he had known he would be sold, maybe he wouldn't have posted via instagram about him wanting to fight for his place. LVG just cuts people off like as if they are flies. Someone battled through injury. It's not like he didn't have options, liverpool wanted him, he chose Utd. LVG gave him a contract, and then never plays him at all (in any cup or league competition), then tells him to train with the reserves. The normal thing is to train with the first team and wait for your chance. Can you imagine Peter Cech, or Neur training in reserves while others play. It's not like he has a problem being a sub. Training with a reserves team is absolutely degrading, because Falcao and RVP did it doesn't mean its not degrading. Don't forget Valdes  did play in some reserve games. So just because he says no once, you cancel his contract and sell him. This is absolute arrogance. Quality players don't fall from the sky. I'm not saying you can't discipline Valdes if he fails to follow your rules, Fergie would have fined him. But this is ridiculous. Extremely bad management and those that are rejoicing don't know anything about management."
reddevils,3dfjcy,Nestledrink,3,Wed Jul 15 23:32:02 2015 UTC,"Im sure there's a bit more to the story than LVG let on. Ultimately we don't know about the inner workings between the players and the Manager, so wether or not communication is bad you can't really tell. He's been in the game for a long time and he knows what he's doing. He's the boss and I trust him. If LVG doesnt want him here I dont either."
reddevils,3dfjcy,opacino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:36:50 2015 UTC,Im sure there's a bit more to the story than LVG let on.    I think this is a fair point. Let's see how the season unfolds.
reddevils,3dfjcy,Moon_Doggie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:57:44 2015 UTC,"Eh. We don't know all the details and I trust LvG in this instance. If it was SAF we would trust in him. Part of the allure is the faith aspect.   The ""bad management"" is subjective opinion, same as the ""good management"" comments are.  Your opinion is the manager did the wrong thing. He could very well have, and if de Gea does go an any capacity we may very well be fucked. Agreed.   If Valdes was asked something and didn't do it; If he in fact refused than that undercuts the authority of the manager and club. With that, I don't think we need him or that influence at all.  EDIT: the video so people who haven't seen can make an opinion of there own  http://youtu.be/a_5ANFxYLZg"

Lots of players refuse to do things. You can discipline them in numerous ways. Its not like Valdes never played reserve games. I guess to your point, we don't know all the details. so lets see how the season turns out."
reddevils,3dfjcy,opacino,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:04:20 2015 UTC,"Not at all. When you join an organization, it is up to you and your employer to hash out details as far as the standard operating procedure.  We all know LVG made players who just recovered to play in youth team as part of the recovery process so this shouldn't be a surprise to Valdes or anyone.   This is why when being called for an interview, employees need to remember to ask tons of questions as well because it's about the interviewee interviewing the company to ensure their vision and ways of doing stuff is aligned because once you're in, you better do everything you are instructed to do."
reddevils,3dfjcy,Zico568,3,Wed Jul 15 23:16:35 2015 UTC,"We all know LVG made players who just recovered to play in youth team as part of the recovery process so this shouldn't be a surprise to Valdes or anyone.     Valdes did play in reserve games. He just refused to play once, probably once he had retained fitness or when he had been a sub and was ready to fill in for De Gea.  When you refuse to follow an instruction once, that is not a call to fire you from your job. There are various ways to discipline players. Let's not act like players never refused to do things under Fergie. If Fergie reacted like LVG then scholes would have been sold very very early into his career, after he refused to come on and play as a sub. We need to be more humane with players. I'm not even saying, don't sell him. Sell him in a humane way. Tell him he's not wanted, don't just announce via preseason squads and leave players looking stupid sending instagram messages."
reddevils,3dfjcy,RadamelBirtles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:15:36 2015 UTC,"Scholes apologized, otherwise he would have been sold. And it's not like we know if Valdes only refused to play in one game. My guess would be it was a couple of things, that just showed he's not compatible with the mentality of LvG. Beside even when Valdes regained fitness, why shouldn't he play for reserves? It's a completely different thing just to train or to play a few matches."
reddevils,3dfjcy,itsalexdean,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:24:56 2015 UTC,little or no communication with the players.    lol. How do you know what has been said?

reddevils,3dfjcy,Pizzaboy2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:47:46 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with you. This whole thing seems totally mismanaged. Leaving Valdes out of the selection should have been cleared up in some way through some 'meaningless' formal statement. Just being silent and coming out with statements like that now is damaging to all parties involved. It should have been sorted behind the scenes since apparently its no recent development at all.  Im a huge fan of van Gaal, but i think he could have done this better and with more class without losing or backing down from his stance."

I read we have offered him £175k a week to stay which is double what he's on now. Considering LVG was resigned to him leaving, something has gone on. I think its weird that this has happened, Madrid seemed to have lost interest in paying for him, and the addidas contract starts next month. What better way to sell more gk shirts than having de gea say he's staying and being plastered all over the newspapers ""launching"" the kit.  Or maybe that's just me reading too much into it."

reddevils,3disro,Atlascantakeit,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:04:53 2015 UTC,"Why not? He'd have stayed for the entirety of his contract, 5 years of service to the club, helping to win us the title and winning our player of the year award twice. Without him there's no way we'd have finished fourth last year. He isn't obligated to sign another contract, and it's not like we can't afford to let him go on a free.  Do all our players have to commit themselves to us for the entirety of their careers to be revered? He's a born and bred Madrilenian. If a Mancunian was playing for RM for 5 years and wanted to return to his hometown, how would we react if RM fans gave him shit for it?"

reddevils,3disro,Hassi94,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:44:18 2015 UTC,I understand we shouldn't hate him if he leaves next season but there's no way he should be considered a 'hero'. The exception being if we win the league or champion's league due to his keeping. Van Persie has 2012-13 and that's why lots of us have a special place in our hearts for him. De Gea has been our best player 2 seasons in a row but he hasn't done anything truly great for us yet.
reddevils,3disro,Feezbull,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:45:43 2015 UTC,"Not impossible he thinks about it of course. But unless he commits himself, he probably would be thinking- nah it won't happen to me. It's a one off. Etc."

This is weird because we have lindegaard, a better 2nd choice than what is rumored Romero. He might be leaving for more game time & with Dave expected to leave, we might be in for a keeper that is almost on Dave's level and linked with a average 2nd choice to sit on the bench?   I believe DDG will go with Ramos coming this way when the deal is sorted between the clubs. The question is when?   Anyway, who are united's mouthpiece? Real have Marca and AS right?"
reddevils,3disro,dhtwentythree,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:18:26 2015 UTC,"Not that I think for a second that we're after Lloris, but we play Spurs a month before the transfer window closes.

reddevils,3disro,ohyou123,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:53:31 2015 UTC,What are people's opinions on Cavani?  I know a lot of United fans don't want him anywhere near the club....has anyone seen much of him that they could give a truthful answer on him?
reddevils,3disro,danc906,2,Thu Jul 16 17:00:57 2015 UTC,I doubt he wants to come here and be second choice to Rooney
reddevils,3disro,ohyou123,-4,Thu Jul 16 17:01:29 2015 UTC,Why are people assuming Rooney is undroppable?  The guy might get injured. He might just need a rest mid-season. Why are people assuming he's going to score 25+ goals?!
reddevils,3disro,danc906,2,Thu Jul 16 17:02:45 2015 UTC,I'm just assuming that he's better than Cavani which is true...so if Rooney stays healthy he's going to be first choice over Cavani nearly every single week and Cavani may not be keen on coming into a situation like that.

reddevils,3dfjyx,omegaxLoL,7,Thu Jul 16 01:22:43 2015 UTC,"Now that he's second choice again (unless Depay plays there in preseason) he may not go at all, considering he's currently injured."
reddevils,3dfjyx,docdaneeeka,18,Wed Jul 15 22:20:09 2015 UTC,If he's willing to stay as a backup it'd be brilliant. No need to sign another striker then perhaps.
reddevils,3dfjyx,snorri,32,Wed Jul 15 21:50:44 2015 UTC,"Backing Chicha to be Mexican Solskjaer! Great backup striker, would love him to regain his form when he was a total shadow in the box, defenders didn't know where he was until the ball was in the back of the net. Love that guy."
reddevils,3dfjyx,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:49:21 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking that for a long time... Unfortunately he seemed to be unhappy with that kind of role. It's a shame really, because he could easily reach the heights that OGS did, but he'll probably never be a starter for a club like United."
reddevils,3dfjyx,SlappyBagg,16,Fri Jul 17 00:59:33 2015 UTC,"Good, would be fine with Rooney, Chicha and Wilson as our 3 for next season."
reddevils,3dfjyx,BengaliBoy,19,Wed Jul 15 22:00:47 2015 UTC,We'd be pretty fucked if Rooney got a long term injury
reddevils,3dfjyx,TopsyKret5,9,Wed Jul 15 23:31:12 2015 UTC,Enter Striker Fellaini.
reddevils,3dfjyx,maybeiambatman,11,Thu Jul 16 07:09:23 2015 UTC,Lol why are you getting downvoted  I agree  Wilson and chica are not consistent when they play 90mins  Edit:words
reddevils,3dfjyx,IBENGM,4,Thu Jul 16 00:25:14 2015 UTC,But it seems like LVG has plans for adjusting Depay to a more aggressive role. He may be able to fill Rooney's shoes assuming Di Maria doesnt leave us empty on the wing
reddevils,3dfjyx,Baron105,9,Thu Jul 16 00:31:06 2015 UTC,"people expect too much of young depay,he is just 21 don't forget and new to the league you cannot just expect him to just start banging in goals in unfamiliar position(striker) in a new league, he need time to adopt in his favourite position first at LW,if he feel more comfortable then MAYBE you can use him as a striker!"
reddevils,3dfjyx,IBENGM,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:42:32 2015 UTC,I hardly think its overestimating his abilities given his build and his determination. The guy will settle in early as fuck and rape in the league. Mark my words. He's absolutely perfect for the premier league.  Many have come and gone as the next Ronaldo and what not but I've only seen this guy possess the drive in recent times that emulates the one CR7 had which took him to the top of the world. I don't know if he'll get there but he'll bloody well try!
reddevils,3dfjyx,Baron105,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:35:36 2015 UTC,"its not ONLY about physical that's where most people get it wrong,success in the premier league has a lot to do with mental strength look at players like mata,silva and cazorla how do you think they are so successful in BPL while the likes of altidore struggle to cope? its more to do with mentality and skill."
reddevils,3dfjyx,craigybacha,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:31:19 2015 UTC,I agree. All I meant to say by mentioning the point of his physicality was he wouldn't be bullied off the ball easily and would have an easier time settling in than most recruits from a different league. The transition would be easier to him.   The main crux of my point was he already does focus on keeping a positive and rigid mentality keeping personal trainers for it even since his earlier days. So I find it easier to believe if I can imagine one youngster most likely be able to stay strong and driven its him.
reddevils,3dfjyx,Marechal64,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:57:37 2015 UTC,"I think it'd be a case of rooney 1st choice, with Hernandez as rotation/sub, and Wilson given a chance every now and then.

reddevils,3dfjyx,RikaMX,13,Thu Jul 16 00:25:52 2015 UTC,I don't see him staying tbh. I wouldn't mind it but he said himself he wants to go somewhere where he gets game time and that is far from guaranteed with us.
reddevils,3dfjyx,rooshbaboosh,6,Wed Jul 15 21:49:43 2015 UTC,"Even so, he loves Manchester so much that he will stay if he's promised decent playing time."
reddevils,3dfjyx,craigybacha,5,Wed Jul 15 22:41:23 2015 UTC,"I'd love Chicharito to stay. I know he hasn't been much of a United player for the past couple of years but with Van Persie and Falcao both no longer at the club, he has a chance to feature more. I'm not saying he's ever going to be picked ahead of a fit/available Rooney, but he'd be a fantastic option to have on the bench or start games that Rooney can't play in for whatever reason.   With the wingers and midfielders we've got putting balls into the box, I could see Hernandez scoring goals even if he doesn't feature much across the season."
reddevils,3dfjyx,AyyItsTheFonz,2,Thu Jul 16 00:32:44 2015 UTC,"Would love it if Hernandez was given a second chance this year. Start with Rooney and have Hernandez on the bench as an impact sub playing the role of a poacher when we need a goal. He was quality when Fergie brought him in, that doesn't just disappear."
reddevils,3dfjyx,craigybacha,5,Thu Jul 16 09:10:03 2015 UTC,Same here. He had a bad stretch of games under Moyes and people just sort of dumped him really. I think he deserves a second chance.
reddevils,3dfjyx,Machr,4,Thu Jul 16 09:17:58 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Plus Moyes couldn't attack a fly, so now with our team and Van Gaal as boss perhaps we can some balls to him to put away."
reddevils,3dfjyx,zanpher717,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:33:19 2015 UTC,"Plus with the few Spanish speaking midfielders we have, it might help him. If he goes to Orlando, I'll be alright with that too."

reddevils,3dfjyx,IBENGM,3,Thu Jul 16 00:10:02 2015 UTC,"Rooney, Chich, Wilson.  I want to believe that we have enough strikers but I just don't.  Fergie always said you need 4 strikers to compete in all competitions.  What if Wayne gets injured?  Then what?  I know we have Memphis but I haven't seen much of him playing as a striker, I guess I trust LVG with that choice though."
reddevils,3dfjyx,craigybacha,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:34:14 2015 UTC,"I'm with you on this i really don't trust having those 3 as our only strikers, i think LVG has put a lot of trust in Wilson which is a Gamble in my eyes,personally i would prefer Wilson to go on loan so we could buy a mature striker for more competition eg Benteke, if anything happens to Rooney and Chicha is out of form then we are officially fucked TBH! the idea of playing Depay as a striker does not excite me i have to say, he still 21, new to the league and i don't see him as a striker at all, he is a winger FFS why force people out position? he tried to do this with dimaria last season and it failed completely! why is this any different?"
reddevils,3dfjyx,maydaybomber,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:51:11 2015 UTC,"This was based more on when we played a 442. If we are playing 1 upfront, which seems extremely likely, then I think 3 strikers are fine... however, whether they're all of good enough quality... we'll find out!"

reddevils,3dfjyx,Baron105,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:13:14 2015 UTC,Take this with a grain of salt. He's coming back to us because he has a contract with us.  The player might still feel like he should be 1st choice and can request to move on. I'm sure his people are on the look out for a transfer.

reddevils,3dfjyx,linkolphd,13,Wed Jul 15 22:36:02 2015 UTC,"I agree Chicha is not the most consistent player out there, but the man doesn't give up and has proven he can score when it matters most."
reddevils,3dfjyx,RikaMX,7,Wed Jul 15 22:43:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, he was fairly consistent before. In his 3rd season he had the best goals/min ratio in the league! Unfortunately that 4th season really hindered him, but with confidence I think he can be fantastic again!"
reddevils,3dfjyx,SlappyBagg,4,Wed Jul 15 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"Oh I completely agree, he was pretty consistent but got hit in the confidence like you said, he just gotta win it back and who knows, Chicha can really play like a pro."

Consistency may be a question but in his defense he doesn't exactly play 90 minutes week in/week out. If he did, though - who knows how high he could achieve."
reddevils,3dfjyx,em22new,-1,Wed Jul 15 23:46:25 2015 UTC,"We've tried him as a starter and it rarely worked, he's always better off the bench against tired legs. Although isn't even that good at that anymore."

reddevils,3dfwh9,720barry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:50:04 2015 UTC,me too
reddevils,3dfwh9,MatthewXu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:58:08 2015 UTC,"I've had success three way ways. Sorry in advance for the length of this.   The first, and easiest, way is to find the hotel. This used to be really hard, but now it's simple (just check their social media accounts). You can then go and wait around there, since they will most certainly be going in and out at different times. This used to be a great option because no one would do it. I got autographs (and pictures) with the entire team back in 2004 because I was one of the only fans there (and they probably preferred giving them to an 11 year old fan rather than the handful of memorabilia sellers that were there). Now, however, people have caught on. When United played in DC last, the entrance was surrounded by fans around the clock. While United reps came out occasionally to hand out free goodies, it was pretty fruitless (since the players knew to limit going in and out of the hotel I imagine).   If you don't want to wait around the clock, here is my tip: Go to the hotel shortly before or after the game. If you go around the time you figure the team will be heading over to the stadium, you know the bus will be there and every member will be walking past. While there will be tons of people who do this for that very reason, the amount of players means you have a decent chance of getting some autographs. They roped it off last time I did because of how many people there were, but I still got Rio, Evra, Nani, and SAF's autographs (and plenty of others were signing for others). But the best choice is after the game. Why? Because most of the aforementioned fans are either still at the game or are waiting around the stadium for autographs. If you haul ass to the hotel, you will not only have another guaranteed passing of the players, but there will likely be few fans there. It's how I got Rooney's autograph.   Note: When it comes to where you place yourself, decide for yourself where you draw the line. Personally, I don't think any fans should be entering the hotel looking for players when the fan does not have a room at the hotel. I think that crosses an already fine line from crazy fan to stalker. I never enter the hotel (aside from the one time a player invited me inside). I have seen plenty of people search out players in the hotel lobby and such with success, but I don't condone that.   The second option (which I mentioned above), is waiting around the stadium. Look for where the buses are and wait around after the game. Just like at Old Trafford, a few players will likely stop to sign. But again, you'll have lots of other fans.   Finally, look for publicity events. Whenever the team is in town, they always do a bunch of different sponsorship/charity events of one sort or another. If you hang around those, you might have some luck."
reddevils,3dfwh9,720barry,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:05:41 2015 UTC,What about getting to the stadium early and getting them while they warm up and what not
reddevils,3dfwh9,Yaja23,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:52:21 2015 UTC,"It's possible, but not likely (in my experience). If you're talking about inside the stadium (as in you plan to go down to the railing while they warm up), that would be virtually impossible. I've never seen that happen. Not only would a coach probably kill the player for being distracted, but the player would suddenly find a swarm of people vying for their signature (since no matter how early you get inside the stadium, plenty of others will be there). I've seen players walk around the edge of the field giving autographs after the game though--more frequently after a public practice session though.  If you're talking about outside the stadium--like finding the bus as it pulls in--you'd have a better chance, but still not very great. Normally the buses go in to the stadium garage, meaning the players would have to leave the stadium to come outside and sign for you. Before a game, most players (understandably) seem in game-mindset and don't care much about giving autographs. Unlikely they'd go out of their way to do. After the game though, it is much more common for players to do that sort of thing."

reddevils,3dfwh9,jonnysh,3,Thu Jul 16 06:02:28 2015 UTC,Your thoughts on why we wont be signing a new striker? Thanks
reddevils,3dfwh9,ekimunited8,7,Thu Jul 16 00:20:38 2015 UTC,"I feel as if we do need a striker! I would really be upset if we didn't sign a proper back up for Rooney. Hernandez isn't a genuine starter in matches. He works best coming off from the bench in the final 25 mins when needed to change the game and poach goals. He was horrible when he started for Real Madrid against A. Madrid in the champions league final. Took forever to get settled into the game and tapped in a goal assisted by Ronaldo. He can't actually create chances for himself to score he is always at the end of the attack. I'm not hating on Hernandez I just don't think such a mentality will help if he starts games for us. He is definitely a super sub. Wilson.... Not even going to explain why he shouldn't be second after Rooney.  We don't need need a cavani or lewondowski, we do need someone like lacazette but even his price rage is ridiculous"

reddevils,3dfwh9,WszystkoZajete,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:02:44 2015 UTC,I'd rather sign a CB before a striker. I also think Chicha deserves a proper shot playing second fiddle in a LVG system. If he doesn't cut the mustard we ship him out and bring in a striker next summer while watching the progress of Kane/Lacazette who imo need another really good season before we even think about splashing that type of cash on them.

Goes to show that they played for the man just as much as the club but it's slowly coming back with Van Gaal. You only have to look at the contrast between the behaviour of opposition managers. When Moyes was here, people like Rodgers and Martinez had their knives out at every opportunity but with Van Gaal it's not happened.

reddevils,3dfkyx,ManUToaster,15,Wed Jul 15 21:56:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all the players know the deal already.   So it's not like Rafael is watching at home going ""Oh he doesn't even mention me, I'm finished""."
reddevils,3dfkyx,mink_man,9,Wed Jul 15 22:04:25 2015 UTC,"I absolutely loved it. LvG's press conferences are great to watch, simply doesn't hold back."
reddevils,3dfkyx,omegaxLoL,8,Wed Jul 15 21:56:23 2015 UTC,Will this presser be on Fulltimedevils later on?
reddevils,3dfkyx,WaffleMan29,2,Wed Jul 15 21:56:41 2015 UTC,Will be uploaded on here once it's on Youtube
reddevils,3dfkyx,j0ydivisi0n,2,Wed Jul 15 22:00:56 2015 UTC,"Apparently they don't have access to pressers on tour, only in Manchester"
reddevils,3dfkyx,BHButcher,8,Wed Jul 15 22:19:55 2015 UTC,"Considering how blunt LVG was about Valdes, I took his comments on di Maria to suggest that the situation is very much up in the air. As it stands, he's still a United player and is expected to stay but he wasn't at all quick to rule out a move later in the window."
reddevils,3dfkyx,bagombos_enough_box,5,Wed Jul 15 21:56:58 2015 UTC,Same with DDG.
reddevils,3dfkyx,tgmgg,8,Wed Jul 15 21:59:35 2015 UTC,It's apparent now that LVG was going easy on reporters last season.  He's really going to give it to them this season and I can't wait to see it.
reddevils,3dfkyx,ekimunited8,7,Thu Jul 16 00:11:28 2015 UTC,He has alienated a lot of people wherever he went...he's just honest unlike a lot of managers.
reddevils,3dfkyx,wsjhqa,22,Thu Jul 16 00:14:46 2015 UTC,"Didn't sound great for Carrick either. Sounds like he's going to be phased out, which is the right move."
reddevils,3dfkyx,yiyiyiyi,28,Wed Jul 15 21:55:44 2015 UTC,I like the fact he said that he sat down with RVP and Carrick and told them directly though at the end of last season.
reddevils,3dfkyx,spoofex,20,Wed Jul 15 21:58:15 2015 UTC,"I have respect for both of them handling it really well. No fuss. Straight professionals. However I think Van Persie's had a hard time at United, first Sir Alex leaving then playing second because of Moyes' and then LvG telling him he wasn't exactly needed."
reddevils,3dfkyx,chocolaidbrowie,23,Wed Jul 15 22:05:40 2015 UTC,"I thought it was interesting when he talked about Fenerbahce being a loving club and that being good for RVP. It's so true. RVP needed the crowd to be chanting his name. It made him play so much better. RVP is a player that needs to be loved.  Ferguson obviously gave him a lot of affection, as did our crowd in that first season. Moyes was a dick to him, no surprise RVP didn't like it. The support from the crowd diminished too. Last season people chanted for Falcao more than they did RVP."
reddevils,3dfkyx,yiyiyiyi,6,Wed Jul 15 22:15:30 2015 UTC,To be fair Falcao needed that support a lot more than RVP. He was simply shocking at times.
reddevils,3dfkyx,benji-21,4,Wed Jul 15 23:09:34 2015 UTC,To be fair Falcao's chant is too good not to sing.
reddevils,3dfkyx,ValenciasLeftFoot,12,Wed Jul 15 23:06:53 2015 UTC,That's no excuse. Rvp did more for us than Falcao did in his dreams.
reddevils,3dfkyx,aman27deep,2,Wed Jul 15 23:16:34 2015 UTC,"RvP came to us in his peak form of his career, Falcao off a massive injury break. It is quite difficult to make sense of a comparison of the two."
reddevils,3dfkyx,rdzzl,7,Thu Jul 16 06:54:50 2015 UTC,But I don't get why he told rvp that he should train alone and not play in the training match in front of the team. That was the brutal and dick move to me based on the mitten information yesterday.
reddevils,3dfkyx,Feezbull,3,Wed Jul 15 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"I agree, it just seems needlessly harsh, RVP didn't deserve that, he has never shown anything but respect to LVG. Don't know why LVG had to go and do that, I feel bad for RVP tbh."
reddevils,3dfkyx,H-E-I-S-E-N-B-E-R-G,3,Thu Jul 16 01:40:02 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate?
reddevils,3dfkyx,aman27deep,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:17:18 2015 UTC,That's apparently what Mitten said he did. Exactly what I wrote. Nothing more though. Seems odd that's why and a dick move if true. Which seems like it could be as rvp didn't acknowledge LvG in his interview but mentioned Woodward specifically. Maybe.
reddevils,3dfkyx,Feezbull,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:03:13 2015 UTC,"If he told him to do that then there was a reason. He wouldn't do it just to be vindictive. Doesn't make sense. The spin is journalistic bs. Was probably as simple as ""we have the practice teams sorted and you're not included so go train on your own instead of standing around wasting time."" Which is fine. The boss says jump, you ask ""how high""."
reddevils,3dfkyx,hoppie00,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:19:52 2015 UTC,And not having him in the team still clearly shows he's not wanted. At all. It's not like we have a plethora of strikers with Hernandez injured too.
reddevils,3dfkyx,Feezbull,5,Thu Jul 16 03:36:28 2015 UTC,Guess Carrick took it much better than RvP.
reddevils,3dfkyx,omegaxLoL,36,Wed Jul 15 22:03:51 2015 UTC,"Dunno. Carrick probably happy to sit back and rotate as a game killer. RVP wants to start and score goals still, which he'll do in Turkey."
reddevils,3dfkyx,spoofex,6,Wed Jul 15 22:05:40 2015 UTC,There's also the fact that LvG said something publicly in training to RvP - it probably had something to do with Robin not taking it well.
reddevils,3dfkyx,FURyannnn,4,Wed Jul 15 22:47:29 2015 UTC,He told him not to play in the training match and to go and train on his own. This is the part I don't understand why.
reddevils,3dfkyx,Feezbull,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:55:24 2015 UTC,Pretty sure RvP wants to be a regular so he can secure the striker spot for Holland for the Euros.
reddevils,3dfkyx,rdzzl,5,Thu Jul 16 06:55:31 2015 UTC,What did he say about Carrick?
reddevils,3dfkyx,slaystation25,15,Wed Jul 15 21:59:17 2015 UTC,He said he talked to him at the end of the season about how new players were coming in to play his position. It was in the same context where he was talking about telling RVP he was leaving.
reddevils,3dfkyx,yiyiyiyi,33,Wed Jul 15 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"I think you and I heard two different versions:  I think he sat Carrick down to tell him that he would be bringing in other players vying for the DM spot and that he would have to fight to stay ""first choice"". Just a courtesy to say that ""You now have some competition. Don't feel so assured in your role as DLM"" and not ""Make way! In with the new and out with the old"". He also made it clear that no one was guaranteed their spot. Only those who were deserving of their place on the team sheet would be selected. So that doesn't necessarily mean it's tickets for Michael."
reddevils,3dfkyx,meplusone,11,Wed Jul 15 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is more like it, he said Carrick has to fight for his place with both Schs and Blind."
reddevils,3dfkyx,as520,16,Wed Jul 15 22:45:37 2015 UTC,Carrick can go a few years yet. You don't need legs for his position.
reddevils,3dfkyx,mink_man,18,Wed Jul 15 22:02:41 2015 UTC,"It's better for us if he starts being phased out. He'll be 34 by next season and is struggling more and more with injuries, time for someone younger to take that position."
reddevils,3dfkyx,omegaxLoL,8,Wed Jul 15 22:04:53 2015 UTC,Why phase out if he's doing a good job. Scholes/Giggs all went well into their 30's. He's not got that many miles on the clock really either..
reddevils,3dfkyx,mink_man,14,Wed Jul 15 22:28:10 2015 UTC,That's where you had the problem Ferguson had with us- use them till their legs are dead. Then use more. And leave the team with zero replacements because they can't continue and you're in the lurch as a result of that.  We were playing a 40 and 38 year old back then for goodness sakes. And still relied on them a fair bit. That was the problem.
reddevils,3dfkyx,Feezbull,2,Wed Jul 15 22:57:10 2015 UTC,this is exactly right. we need to prepare for the long-term
reddevils,3dfkyx,clinicallyawkward,11,Wed Jul 15 23:44:21 2015 UTC,"Even Scholes and Giggs were eventually phased out, and they didn't struggle with as many injuries as Carrick did last season in their last years. I'd much prefer it if we didn't rely on Carrick as much anymore exactly due to his increasing problems with injuries."
reddevils,3dfkyx,omegaxLoL,3,Wed Jul 15 22:36:39 2015 UTC,Scholes and Giggs were elite quality players. Once upon a time the best in their positions. Carrick never was even close. Good decision by vG.
reddevils,3dfkyx,aman27deep,5,Wed Jul 15 23:19:15 2015 UTC,Of course you need legs for midfield. He'd be roasted by any good or physical team. It's almost the worst position to play in when you can't run.
reddevils,3dfkyx,WillyMorganOnTheWing,5,Wed Jul 15 22:28:37 2015 UTC,I like how he doesn't beat around the bush. That probably helps players make up their mind as well.
reddevils,3dfkyx,slaystation25,2,Wed Jul 15 22:02:11 2015 UTC,"It's not like Carrick wouldn't have seen this coming.   He'll know he'll still have a role to play, and with heavy rotation and long resting periods I think we can still get top performances out of him"
reddevils,3dfkyx,daniam1,12,Wed Jul 15 22:18:36 2015 UTC,When we played Arsenal in the 2nd to last game of the season we thought we were watching De Gea's last game for us but it turned out to be Valdes's 2nd to last. Wow

reddevils,3dfkyx,arron77,7,Wed Jul 15 22:43:56 2015 UTC,"Great presser, love LVG and his honest approach. Interesting when discussing who can play  centre mid he said Blind, Schweini, Schneidi and Carrick but no mention of Herrera. I guess that could mean we will see him playing further forward and competing with Mata, Fellaini etc for a more attacking midfield role"
reddevils,3dfkyx,bionicbar,2,Wed Jul 15 22:01:02 2015 UTC,Think he was referring to the two deeper roles. He sees Herrera playing where Fellaini was last year IMO.  While the midfield is a v it is a lopsided one and Herrera should be furthest forward.
reddevils,3dfkyx,G_Morgan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:18:06 2015 UTC,Last season I thought Herrera was level with Fellaini most of the time.  It was a 4-1-4-1 not a 4-2-1-2-1.  Sounds like he's planning to chance to the latter though and play a double pivot.  Hard to imagine him signing Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin when we already have Carrick and Blind if he isn't planning on playing two of them.
reddevils,3dfkyx,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:40:47 2015 UTC,It was 4-3-3 but as common the midfield gets staggered. LVG has said he prefers one CM to be more defensive than the other. You end up like this  Fellaini             Herrera       Carrick   Nearly every 4-3-3 ends up like this. Xavi always had more defensive responsibility than Iniesta.  This also tends to change through the phases. Once in the top third of the pitch Herrera did then pull up level with Fellaini.
reddevils,3dfkyx,G_Morgan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:55:44 2015 UTC,Maybe. The alternative interpretation is that he was only talking about the DM role itself.
reddevils,3dfkyx,G_Morgan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:16:58 2015 UTC,"So we'd then have 4 players for one position, with two of them freshly signed to compete for one position?  Sounds hard to believe."
reddevils,3dfkyx,JuanRiquelme,2,Thu Jul 16 10:20:36 2015 UTC,Well I think he also sees Blind playing LB a lot and Schneiderlin at least playing where Herrera is a lot. Maybe Schweinsteiger depending on how his fitness looks. So it isn't just 4 players for 1 position exclusively.

reddevils,3dfkyx,BoyWhoCanDoAnything,3,Wed Jul 15 22:09:47 2015 UTC,What did he say about Rafael?
reddevils,3dfkyx,spoofex,15,Wed Jul 15 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"Nothing. He didn't even say his name, which was exactly the problem, as they were discussing right backs at the club."
reddevils,3dfkyx,yiyiyiyi,6,Wed Jul 15 21:55:57 2015 UTC,The question was something like:   Why did you sign Darmian when you have Rafael   and LVG answered by saying   I like a right back who can defend...
reddevils,3dfkyx,mocthezuma,2,Wed Jul 15 21:57:31 2015 UTC,So Valencia is a better defender than Rafael?
reddevils,3dfkyx,Feezbull,4,Wed Jul 15 21:59:01 2015 UTC,"Tactically, yes. As much as he's not a defender, he's a fantastic player who listens to tactical instructions and does exactly what the manager wants. Which means he wouldn't leave the aspects he should do etc. rafael isn't as disciplined in that aspect."
reddevils,3dfkyx,TheGhostOfBabyOscar,2,Wed Jul 15 22:18:07 2015 UTC,"Didn't mention him at all when talking about Darmian being in the starting eleven or not. 'Darmian has to fight against Valencia for the RB position"" (paraphrasing)  edit: clarity, maybe?"

It seems to me there is a deal in the making for him to leave the club and I don't like it. It would be a huge mistake to let him go just because of last season. He is a terrific player who obviously needed some time, even Fergie said it takes a year for players to settle down in Premier League. I think LVG is making a big mistake if he's letting him go..."
reddevils,3dfkyx,Feezbull,9,Wed Jul 15 22:50:52 2015 UTC,"If he wants to leave and not actually try and establish himself, that's his choice. Thanks but we don't need a player who doesn't want to prove himself.

Moyes didn't, and LVG, or maybe Woodward, wanted to try the Falcao experiment. With Rooney being I believe 30 soon, and us playing in 4 competitions, all three of them should get decent amount of games."

Hopefully him saying Di Maria will come back for training means he's staying. Don't want ADM to go and if I was LVG I would make him stay.
reddevils,3dfkyx,asteroid_puncher,12,Wed Jul 15 21:54:54 2015 UTC,I would imagine they're trying to convince him to stay at least another season and Di Maria is still deciding.

reddevils,3dfkyx,WszystkoZajete,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:03:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I feel it was the right thing to say what he said about Valdes. We gave him a chance to recover after a serious knee injury. We've let him use our state of the art facilities even before he signed for us. Seriously, did he expect that all of a sudden LVG will drop the best goalkeeper in the league to play him, just because what, he came from Barca? He must've known what he was signing to when he committed to United - that was being a backup and playing/practising with the fucking second team. Seriously, if that was the case, then he can go and fuck himself. Not even 6 months at the club and he's already throwing tantrum, fucking top class star my ass..."
reddevils,3dhjrs,fergieschewinggum,17,Thu Jul 16 09:22:20 2015 UTC,"...Written by Pete Jenson from the DM who was of course not under pressure to milk the story already in the very first morning paper right after LvG's presser. That he had only few hours to bring this story of course hasn't had any effect on the accuracy of the double-checked ""facts"" presented in the content of the article."

reddevils,3dhjrs,xtfftc,7,Thu Jul 16 11:35:28 2015 UTC,"This is not the first time Louis van Gaal has clashed with Victor Valdes.  Both men were at war at Barcelona in 2002 but made peace and the goalkeeper went on to become Barca’s greatest ever stopper.  It was 13 years ago that Valdes came through the ranks at the Nou Camp alongside another promising keeper by the name of Pepe Reina.  ￼ Victor Valdes sitting alongside manager Louis van Gaal after signing for Manchester United in January ￼ Valdes only made his Manchester United debut in May, coming on as a sub against Arsenal ￼ With David de Gea (left) as No 1 at United, Valdes has made just two appearances for the Red Devils Could Valdes be heading to Real as De Gea goes on tour? Valdes turned down the chance to go out on loan to Villarreal because he was assured by Van Gaal that he would become Barcelona’s first choice ahead of Reina.  In the end it was Reina who went out on loan to Villarreal and Valdes started the season in the first team with Van Gaal’s backing.  But two months into the season Valdes was dropped back into the Barca reserves and Van Gaal told him he was going to play for the youth side in a second division match away to Reus. He missed B-team training on the eve of the game furious at the U-turn from his manager.  ￼ Valdes denies Arsenal's Thierry Henry in the 2006 Champions League final during an inspired performance which played a big role in helping Barca claim a 2-1 victory in Paris ￼ Valdes denies Manchester United's Wayne Rooney in the 2011 Champions League final He told Sportsmail last season: ‘It’s not that I didn’t want to play for the B-team. But Van Gaal told me on a Thursday, and so on the Friday I had to train with the B-team and play that same Saturday and I told him that I needed a weekend to think about what the future held for me going back to the B-team and all the implications of that.  'This was bearing in mind that he knew in the summer I had rejected the chance to move to Villarreal to play in the first division with them. It wasn’t so much that I felt betrayed by him but I at least wanted a weekend to think about it all.’  Van Gaal was under pressure at Barcelona at the time and the Catalan media jumped on the difference of opinion between the young keeper and the Dutch coach. Valdes returned to the first team but Van Gaal never made it to the end of the season. He was fired and replaced by Radomir Antic who was then succeeded by Frank Rijkaard.  ￼ Valdes briefly lost his place to Turkey goalkeeper Rustu Recber (left) during his time at Barca ￼ Pepe Reina was also vying with Valdes for the No 1 jersey during his time at Barca, with the former Liverpool goalkeeper punching the ball away against the Reds during a UEFA Cup match at the Nou Camp in 2001 When Rijkaard first arrived he favoured Turkish stopper Rustu Recber but Valdes soon won over his new coach and with one of the performances of his career in Paris in 2006 against Arsenal in the Champions League final he ended all doubts about being Barcelona’s No 1.  He went on to become the most decorated goalkeeper in Barcelona’s history with most supporters agreeing that he is the club’s greatest ever, urging more to be done to stop him leaving in 2014.  His future could yet be back in La Liga with Valencia hoping to take him on loan this season. They begin Champions League qualification next month and have first choice Diego Alves out with knee ligament damage.  At just 33, Valdes still feels he has four years left at the top and wants to compete with David de Gea and Iker Casillas for the Spain goalkeeping shirt at next summer’s European Championship."

reddevils,3dhjrs,itsandercontrol,2,Thu Jul 16 11:40:58 2015 UTC,"Tl;Dr: Valdes refused to play for the secondary team, Van Gaal doesn't bring him on tour because of this and because he doesn't follow his philosophy (of sometimes playing for the second team) and therefore will be sold."
reddevils,3dhjrs,AyyItsTheFonz,8,Thu Jul 16 12:29:39 2015 UTC,"of sometimes playing for the second team   Not to be rude but it isn't for the sake of playing for the second team, it's for the sake of their fitness. RVP, Falcao, Shaw, Evans & Herrara all played at least 1 U21 game after coming off their respective injuries.   Valdes put his ego ahead of his fitness and that was just stupid of him."
reddevils,3dhjrs,itsandercontrol,2,Thu Jul 16 10:07:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it also had to do with match rhythm and concentration just in case De Gea gets injured or something."

""ManU is not a term United fans refer to themselves as. The term is only used by other supporters as a complete and utter insult to our club. The 'u' is meant to be 'you' by the rival fans. An early example of its usage is this chant by West Brom fans: 'Duncan Edwards is manure, rotting in his grave, man you are manure- rotting in your grave'. The origin of 'ManU' is a song to insult the dead Duncan Edwards. Liverpool and Leeds fans copied this with their own man you /u versions to insult all of the lads who died at munich. 'ManU ManU went on a plane ManU ManU never came back again' and.. 'Man U Never Intended Coming Home' (if you combine the first letter of each word you get the word 'munich').""  Just saying :)"

(I mean every article posted about it in this thread for example is post 2005 and all by foreign fans for example)  Ninja edit: It was started by people wanting to feel like top fans, and it's spread among people who consider themselves top fans. Season ticket holders could not give a shit either way, neither could anyone at the club."

Never claimed to be a super fan or better than anyone else, just claimed it was an insulting.

reddevils,3dgp0j,jnwallac,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:07:31 2015 UTC,I can help verify my connection if you would like.  If you watch last years MUTV documentary on Ron Atkinson there is a middle aged woman who takes him around the museum tour and does a quick question/answer.  If you would like I can send a picture to yourself via a message of this woman outside of work as she is a good friend (not family but know her through family connections).  Can't think of anything more solid other than a picture of my family in their suits but that would give them away regardless of bluring the faces.

reddevils,3dgy8o,SuzukaYuiMoa,40,Thu Jul 16 04:44:04 2015 UTC,"Just fucking keep Lindegaard. Really not liking how many new players we're getting in such a short period of time. I mean, it's okay when they are players we actually need, but why bring in another player that doesn't speak English when we already have a perfectly capable backup with Lindegaard."
reddevils,3dgy8o,TheDrySkinOnYourKnee,12,Thu Jul 16 05:50:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's not perfectly capable any more? To be fair we haven't seen him play in 2 years, he hasn't played a single competitive match in that time. He's hasn't played much U21 even. Van Gaal and our coaches have been watching him train week in, week out. I trust they'll make a better decision than us."
reddevils,3dgy8o,JGQuintel,-5,Thu Jul 16 05:56:48 2015 UTC,But then LVG would of told him he's not good enough and not taken him on tour. He played during the last tour as well.
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,5,Thu Jul 16 05:58:26 2015 UTC,How is LVG telling him hes not good enough and not taking him on tour the only other option?
reddevils,3dgy8o,ThatBoyGiggsy,9,Thu Jul 16 07:54:26 2015 UTC,"I have to agree. Lindegaard is a decent No.2 behind De Gea. He's been at the club a few years now and knows how we play, knows the team, the league and everything else. I say give him a decent contract and forget about Romero or other unnecessary signings.  You may not agree with me on this one but I think we should also hold on to Hernandez as a forward option."
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,5,Thu Jul 16 06:10:19 2015 UTC,"I fully agree. Regarding Hernandez also, I'd rather have him as 2nd striker, knows the club etc, and we've seen what he can do off the bench. I'd rather keep him than have to spend £32.5m on fucking Benteke."
reddevils,3dgy8o,LevynX,5,Thu Jul 16 06:12:51 2015 UTC,"However, he's not really satisfied playing from the bench, that was the whole reason he went to Real last season."
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,5,Thu Jul 16 07:43:05 2015 UTC,Which was a stupid decision on his behalf.
reddevils,3dgy8o,tastytext,3,Thu Jul 16 07:59:12 2015 UTC,"There was a difference between Moyes bench and Fergies bench. He looked happier under Ferguson playtime conditions, moyes short stints just made him bitter."
reddevils,3dgy8o,honey_pie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:30:32 2015 UTC,"This is foolish talk. He was obviously not that unhappy about being 2nd choice because there is no way he thought he'd be pushing Benzema out at Madrid. He's not a fucking idiot, he's a professional footballer give him some credit that he might actually have a bit of a clue. He obviously wants playing time, which there was more opportunity for at Madrid behind Benzema than at United behind Rooney, RVP and Falcao. He obviously wants to play for a prestigious club more than he wants to be a guaranteed starter, else he would have gone on loan somewhere else. So I don't see that he'd have a problem staying this season, IMO question is more if we sell him now because of his contract situation.."
reddevils,3dgy8o,hawkinsno2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:44:22 2015 UTC,This might be a terrible way of looking at the situation but Lindegaard does not complain about his lack of games. He loves the club and is willing to play at any level. That it enough for me to personally want to give him the No 2.
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,2,Thu Jul 16 09:11:33 2015 UTC,There really is no point in getting this guy. I hope Roma get him.
reddevils,3dgy8o,honey_pie,2,Thu Jul 16 05:57:02 2015 UTC,"People here really overrate Lindegaard imo. He's a liability in goal, and it's still likely DDG may leave, be it now or the end of the season, so I'd like us to have a 2nd keeper who could play week in week out and not be reason to panic (like Valdes or AFAICT Romero)- we don't know who will be available next summer, and being desperate could jack up the price too."
reddevils,3dgy8o,hawkinsno2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:34:49 2015 UTC,"I agree, there is one thing buying players which we actually need, but absolutely no point in getting a 'back-up' keeper when we have a good enough one in Lindegaard. I imagine it distrupts the team massively having an injection of new faces in a short length of time."
reddevils,3dgy8o,ManUToaster,1 point,Thu Jul 16 09:05:28 2015 UTC,Not to mention if we lose Lindeegard we also lose the hottest wag in the squad =p
reddevils,3dgy8o,xtfftc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:45:29 2015 UTC,"Lindegaard wanted to leave the last transfer window though, so it's fair to say that he doesn't want to be the back-up keeper anymore. As professional as he is and as much as he loves United, the probably wants to play regularly at this point."
reddevils,3dgy8o,nubijoe,0,Thu Jul 16 11:37:43 2015 UTC,Doesn't LvG rate Lindegaard? He did quite well before

reddevils,3dgy8o,soma40,8,Thu Jul 16 05:53:02 2015 UTC,"I'd be sad to see him go. He is a great player with serious ability. Despite a poor showing last season, I'd stick with him, he's too good to let go just like that."
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,6,Thu Jul 16 05:58:00 2015 UTC,"Regardless of his season, I don't think his heart is in it as much as the others."
reddevils,3dgy8o,kw9403,2,Thu Jul 16 06:07:51 2015 UTC,Unless we get Bale I don't want him to leave. He's world class and there's not a better option for a RW right now who's available.

reddevils,3dgy8o,omegaxLoL,4,Thu Jul 16 06:13:12 2015 UTC,He's on tour. He had a good spell at Preston (yes i know Preston) and played well on last seasons tour. We'll see how well he does on this tour.
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,5,Thu Jul 16 06:19:48 2015 UTC,"He's on tour   Well..considering Amos was released, and the problems with Valdés, we only had De Gea and Johnstone to take on tour when it comes to GKs."
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,3,Thu Jul 16 09:04:04 2015 UTC,Lindegaard...
reddevils,3dgy8o,omegaxLoL,3,Thu Jul 16 09:04:35 2015 UTC,And Johnstone was on tour last season.
reddevils,3dgy8o,soma40,2,Thu Jul 16 09:05:14 2015 UTC,"Woops, missed that. Thought he wasn't taken on tour for some reason."
reddevils,3dgy8o,Calimariae,2,Thu Jul 16 09:06:59 2015 UTC,What about Lindegaard?
reddevils,3dgy8o,owis,2,Thu Jul 16 05:31:32 2015 UTC,"He hasn't played a first team match in forever.  I absolutely love Lindegaard, and it's so obvious how much he loves the club. I wish he was as good as we need him to be."
reddevils,3dgy8o,xtfftc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:04:06 2015 UTC,There's a reason Sergi Romero was playing for bloody Sampadoria. I'd rather have Lindegaard. Romero's just coming in because of the LVG connection.
reddevils,3dgy8o,Baelix,2,Fri Jul 17 03:31:55 2015 UTC,Sergio Romero is getting #2? How good is he as a LB?  That's clearly it for Rafael then :(
reddevils,3dgy8o,sephiroth399,2,Thu Jul 16 11:38:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think we're in for him, to be honest.  Lindegaard is a solid #2, and has been for years. I think this is just speculation due to the LvG press conference comments about Valdes being off."
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,2,Thu Jul 16 14:36:12 2015 UTC,"I hope not he wasnt great at the copa america, he may have got to the finals but he isnt united quality, probably better to try and get lloris"
reddevils,3dgy8o,sephiroth399,3,Thu Jul 16 05:46:52 2015 UTC,"For free you can't go too far wrong. Romero would not be on a big wage either, He'd likely come into the reserves.  You'd have to spend allot of money to get Lloris and If De Gea stays, There's no real need or place for two star keepers in the side."
reddevils,3dgy8o,StannisJr,3,Thu Jul 16 06:22:20 2015 UTC,So then what is the point in having Lindegaard?
reddevils,3dgy8o,nicebike,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:29:30 2015 UTC,"yeah you can, i wouldnt want a shit keeper for free, plus having to pay him some sort of wages. there is no place at all for him at United, he should forget about ever being our player."

reddevils,3dfi2e,-Michael_Scotch,28,Wed Jul 15 21:28:55 2015 UTC,Not sure we needed any more proof. It's been confirmed by his agent already.   If anything it tells us that he trusts Valencia at RB and rightly so after last season. Couple of mistakes in positioning but nothing that can't be ironed out and improved on the training pitch.   Interesting if we revert to a 4-3-3 as he could potentially play anywhere in defence or the attacking role.

reddevils,3dfi2e,Memphisboots,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:30:36 2015 UTC,"rightly so after last season   Trusts Valencia at right back, so buys a new right back.   couple of mistakes in positioning   Directly responsible for 4-5 goals from the right back position in the last two seasons.  Valencia is a terrible full back. Everyone knows this. Nice lad, has had some great moments for United, but he ain't a full back. If he was as good as everyone on here makes out he'd be getting his opportunity in the first team. He's sub-John O'Shea level (John O'Shea wasn't good enough for United either)."
reddevils,3dfi2e,felinenimbostratus,3,Thu Jul 16 11:33:06 2015 UTC,"Trusts Valencia at right back, so buys a new right back.   For competition yes. Same with the vast array of central midfielders we have now. He trusts him more than Raf that's why AV is staying and Raf ins't.    Directly responsible for 4-5 goals from the right back position in the last two seasons.   In the defense phase of play, completely agree and I even called that out. The point is LVG doesn't trust Rafael in either defense and attack. You saw against Liverpool that for LVG's philosophy to work, there is a need for the entire team to work in unison through all phases of play. Valencia does that better than Raf.   Valencia is a terrible full back. Everyone knows this.    The manager clearly doesn't.   If he was as good as everyone on here makes out he'd be getting his opportunity in the first team.    First choice last season over Raf. Raf's gone and Valencia is the one Darmian has to compete with.  I'm not saying Valencia is the best RB available to us. My whole post was addressing that LVG trusts AV over Rafael - it's not an opinion, it's fact hence the selling of Rafael and the comments from LVG about AV yesterday."
reddevils,3dfi2e,cousinrayray,0,Thu Jul 16 11:56:14 2015 UTC,"The manager clearly doesn't.   I'd say that he does. That's why he signed a right back as his first signing of the summer (after Depay).   First choice last season over Raf   I'd be ahead of Rafael in the pecking order. The lad is absolutely bobbins, and made of glass too. The 12 year old Americans on here love his ""passion"" which just about seals him as an A grade twat for me."

He added so much to our play on the right, and was solid in defence as well. He had tons of talent to go along with his passion. Unfortunately he doesn't fit into Van Gaal's plans, most probably because of his size, but that doesn't mean he's bad.  Fuck, the short-term memory of some people... Ironic that you're calling other people out for being ignorant. And what does being American have to do with anything?"
reddevils,3dfi2e,ParkerZA,-2,Thu Jul 16 13:19:24 2015 UTC,"Rafael was amazing for us under SAF.   Rafael was a weak link for us under SAF. Prone to injury, loss of form, huge defensive lapses, rash challenges, and red cards when under pressure. He was totally found out time and time again.   He added so much to our play on the right, and was solid in defence as well.   I don't think you, or I, or anyone on this sub, or anyone on the internet would objectively describe Rafael as ""solid in defence"".  He was a dozy cunt. Most matchgoing fans became enormously frustrated with him and our persistence with him.   He had tons of talent to go along with his passion.   He's quite quick I suppose?   Unfortunately he doesn't fit into Van Gaal's plans, most probably because of his size, but that doesn't mean he's bad.   And, as LVG said, he can't defend ""in the first phase"". And he doesn't add that much going forward (really, he doesn't).   Fuck, the short-term memory of some people...   Never rated him that highly. At his best he was always liable to be found out by being out of position. No surprise that he's being moved on.   Ironic that you're calling other people out for being ignorant.   ?   And what does being American have to do with anything?   Because most of the people on this sub have never seen Rafael play live. (Many of them, I'd bet, have never even been to any top tier football game.) It makes a big difference."
reddevils,3dfi2e,felinenimbostratus,2,Thu Jul 16 13:30:29 2015 UTC,"Nope, don't agree with you. He was one of our most consistent performers, you could see the difference when he was on the pitch. He added a bit of dynamism to our right hand side, and he was great attacking wise. I don't know what games you were watching but he was a decent crosser, good on both feet, linked up well with other players, and could actually beat a man. Seem to recall him hitting a fee screamers as well.   Defensively, yes, he was solid. I remember him having Bale in his back pocket when he was the next big thing.   All the people that have praised him aren't delusional, or wearing rose tinted glasses. Saying all he had going for him is passion is nonsense.  Oh and seeing football games live doesn't give you an innate understanding of the game that gets filtered out through a television. Yes there's a difference and it's arguably superior but come on...

reddevils,3dfi2e,ParkerZA,-1,Thu Jul 16 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"He was one of our most consistent performers,   For the last two years his inconsistent performances have been the reason he hasn't figured when fit. Ferguson, Moyes, and LVG did not consider him the undisputed first choice full back. Telling.   you could see the difference when he was on the pitch.   Agreed but for different reasons!   He added a bit of dynamism to our right hand side, and he was great attacking wise.   He's fast. His crossing was OK (not brilliant). He could beat a man once in a while. But he wasn't more effective than Gary Neville in attack.   I don't know what games you were watching but he was a decent crosser, good on both feet, linked up well with other players, and could actually beat a man. Seem to recall him hitting a fee screamers as well.   Maybe two? 12 assists and 5 goals in his United career. If you're going to include a full back for his attacking prowess you'd surely expect better.   Defensively, yes, he was solid. I remember him having Bale in his back pocket when he was the next big thing.   I guess you know better than LVG.   All the people that have praised him aren't delusional, or wearing rose tinted glasses.   All the fans who know nothing about football? When our manager is shifting him on because he can't defend and isn't much cop in attack?   Saying all he had going for him is passion is nonsense.   That was certainly his standout attribute.   Oh and seeing football games live doesn't give you an innate understanding of the game that gets filtered out through a television.    It's completely different.   Yes there's a difference and it's arguably superior but come on...   It's completely different. Completely. You can't judge a player unless you've seen them play live.   Okay, wait...

reddevils,3dfi2e,Surfacing710,8,Wed Jul 15 21:33:25 2015 UTC,It's obvious that Van Gaal prefers Valencia though so he'll be the one competing for the place.
reddevils,3dfi2e,mocthezuma,2,Wed Jul 15 21:36:36 2015 UTC,Rafael was man of the match against West Ham at home last season. Valencia didn't come close to performing at that level as RB.  This is really disappointing.
reddevils,3dfi2e,WadeRonney,2,Wed Jul 15 22:12:35 2015 UTC,"I agree with your overarching sentiment that Rafael at full flight is a better RB than Valencia. Just more skilled overall.  However, I would make the exactly same decision as Van Gaal simply because Valencia is just a vastly better player based on last season's showing. Consistent like a robot. Can run non-stop from 0 to the 95th minute. Fit as a horse, provided much needed stability when players were dropping faster than pilgrims at the long march. Works his ass off and it's clear to see his commitment. Plus he has the pace to track other fast RBs and wingers so he has been very very effective for most part.  All that adds up to Rafael being a distant second unless he shows ridiculous improvement and maturity and skills in preseason / training / reserves."
reddevils,3dfi2e,IBENGM,2,Thu Jul 16 08:45:19 2015 UTC,"Being natural to that position does not matter, what matters is your performance and reliability,Rafael is always injured like 85% of the time and is too rush hence poor defensively,why some people can't understand this is beyond me!

I'm genuinely curious about this on Valencia. He performed quite well last year, and deputized well at RB even back to SAF's days. He even (to me) seems to benefit the team more playing RB than when he's played RM.   And, for the record, I fully expect Darmian to make the position his own, barring some unforeseen circumstances like injury."
reddevils,3dfi2e,aallmark,3,Wed Jul 15 21:43:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, Rafael is also known for making a lot of defensive errors. it doesn't help when he spends most of each match on a booking either."
reddevils,3dfi2e,mocthezuma,3,Thu Jul 16 09:33:17 2015 UTC,Valencia made a number of defensive errors last season. Most notably the mistake that led to Welbeck's goal that put us out of the FA cup. I don't understand how anyone can consider him a better defender than Rafael.  The only reason I can see is height. Rafael is better at tackling and defensive positioning and he makes better choices playing from the right back position in terms of passing and runs.
reddevils,3dfi2e,slippstroke,12,Wed Jul 15 22:26:56 2015 UTC,"I think you underrate Valencia a bit. He's main strength is his physicality, he's an absolute beast; built like a brick shithouse. The man does not get injured, plays 90 minutes week in week out bounding up and down the field. He's not that great at crossing but that's not as important if you're playing right back.  He's a good tackler, he just needs to improve on his defensive concentration and he'd be a solid full back. More than suitable back up for Darmian now.  He worked well with Herrera and Mata last season too. His physicality and sheer effort made up for Mata's lack of strength and stamina, while Mata's fantastic ability on the ball made up for Valencia's weaknesses.  I do think Darmian will replace him straight away in the first 11 but Valencia is a solid 2nd choice for sure."
reddevils,3dfi2e,WRCousCous,2,Wed Jul 15 22:34:38 2015 UTC,"This is pretty consistent with the way I see the issue as well. Valencia fits LVG's system better than Rafael and is more reliable (in terms of fitness). I expect Darmian to take the whole right side up a notch, but I'm not bothered at all if Valencia has to play games when Darmian is out."
reddevils,3dfi2e,mocthezuma,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:49:16 2015 UTC,"What seems to be edging it in favor of Valencia and Darmian is height.  Rafael is 1m72cm, Valencia is 1m80cm and Darmian is 1m82cm.   Looks to me like Van Gaal hasn't forgotten the Drogba goal at Old Trafford last season(for some reason Rafael was marking Drogba on a defensive corner), but when Ferguson was managing Rafael was always on either post when defending corners. Last season we had Van Persie on the post at some defensive corners. And even Phil Jones taking corners. So I'm not overly convinced with the coaching setup on corners. I definitely hope there's more to it than that, but I can't see how anyone in their right mind can argue that Valencia is better defensively than Rafael."
reddevils,3dfi2e,WadeRonney,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:57:18 2015 UTC,"If Van Gaal hasn't forgotten anything, that would be his moment of madness vs Leicester.  A RB losing a header to a CF is hardly catastrophic. In fact it's expected, which is why CBs cover CFs.  RBs aren't expected to be tall. Carlos, Alba, Lahm, endless list. I think Rafael's rashness didn't help his case coupled with the inconsistency due to injury which make it difficult for a coach to plan to game when one of your main cogs is frequently busted."
reddevils,3dfi2e,FURyannnn,6,Thu Jul 16 08:50:44 2015 UTC,"the only reason   There are many reasons, most notably health and fitness as well as overall work ethic. Valencia is a straight up workhorse and is very flexible with where he plays, which is an asset to any squad.  Additionally, a ""number"" of defensive errors? He had a couple, as did many other of our natural defenders. It's to be expected; nobody is perfect."
reddevils,3dfi2e,mocthezuma,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:39:53 2015 UTC,"It's to be expected; nobody is perfect.   Right, which is why I wouldn't be discarding Rafael either."
reddevils,3dfi2e,Illum503,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:59:24 2015 UTC,He was basically always out of position. Just because it only got punished a few (much more than a couple) times doesn't make it ok.
reddevils,3dfi2e,nigga_peas,4,Wed Jul 15 23:45:33 2015 UTC,"LvG spends a lot of time analyzing videos of the players.  If he has an issue with Valencias positioning, then Darmian will start."
reddevils,3dfi2e,nigga_peas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:52:24 2015 UTC,Then obviously Darmian will win out
reddevils,3dfi2e,cousinrayray,3,Wed Jul 15 23:49:49 2015 UTC,"There was an article the other day about how Van Gaal likes to work with people that are willing to adapt to his philosophy, listen and adapt to his teachings etc. Because he wants all 11 players on the pitch to be ""singing from the same hymn sheet"". I'm on my phone but I'll try find it, it's a good read.   It's been noted throughout last season that Van Gaal didn't rate rafa as much as he roamed out of position in the final third when attacking as well as letting his emotions get the better of him when LVG likes his players to be ""thinkers"" and play smart.   Valencia definitely made some mistakes last year, but positioning is something that can be improved so it shouldn't surprise us too much why LVG has made this decision."
reddevils,3dfi2e,Entrepreneur_Girl,3,Wed Jul 15 21:43:05 2015 UTC,I would like to better understand his philosophy is there place you can point me to to have a read. I have been lost at times trying to understand to be honest. I do understand he likes to have a lot of possession to try open up play for attack. That's the only thing I understood right off bat last season.
reddevils,3dfi2e,omegaxLoL,3,Wed Jul 15 21:51:32 2015 UTC,"Doubt there'll be much of a fight if Darmian shows his quality right away and remains injury free like he has for the past years. Still, would rather have Rafael as a back up then if that's the case."
reddevils,3dfi2e,as520,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:35:54 2015 UTC,Rafael is gone.
reddevils,3dfi2e,iamafitrunner,3,Wed Jul 15 21:37:17 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy LVG thinks this way.  Valencia has been an absolute warrior for us .Off course he has up and down season at right back because its not his natural position, but he is an awesome selfless team player.  I hope we go a long run in the Cups and Champion Leagues so that both Darmian and Valencia get good amount of game time."
reddevils,3dfi2e,Ta0Ta,3,Wed Jul 15 21:57:23 2015 UTC,Well that shouldn't take too long. Valencia's ball-watching is just embarrassing and anyone with some defensive awareness should be playing ahead of him soon enough.
reddevils,3dfi2e,jaanmek,3,Thu Jul 16 01:54:32 2015 UTC,"Never seen Darmian playing , but I assume he can defend, beat first man and cross the ball then he should have no competition there."
reddevils,3dfi2e,nerongod,4,Thu Jul 16 12:08:52 2015 UTC,Valencia is a better player and I have no doubt that he will remain as our nr 1 wing back.

On De Gea, LvG said: “No [we cannot talk about him].”     Victor Valdes (RIP):   Valencia are looking for a new goalkeeper, and Victor Valdes is one of their options.

[AS] Representatives of Victor Valdes met with Valencia executives on Tuesday. [Sport] Valencia are in advanced talks with Valdes for a loan transfer.

Van Gaal believes that he should stay for at least one more season. PSG are Di Maria’s most likely destination if he leaves United this summer. [Jamie Jackson]  Manchester United are braced for a formal approach from PSG for Di Maria. PSG are expected to open the bidding at £45m (€64.3m), although United will hold out for more. Bayern Munich are also monitoring Di Maria’s situation. [James Ducker]  On Di Maria’s future, LvG said: “We shall see. It’s a process.”      Robin Van Persie:   A fee has yet to be agreed between Manchester United and Fenerbahce for Robin van Persie.

He is one of the best strikers in the league in the air, and that's one thing we've been missing in strikers for years.    Granted it's what Fellaini has been for but having them both in the box would be hazardous for the oppositions defence.  He's a confident finisher and a very noticeable presence.  He'd cost a lot but I'm not comfortable with any of our current options if Rooney were to get injured.  That being said, I still wish we hadn't sold Van Persie."

I like Christian. I live basically a few hundred meters from where he grew up, I'm very happy he has reached a (somewhat unexpected) level that allows him to play in the Premier League and I wish him all the best for our National Team but I really, really don't think he'd be a good buy for Manchester United.

reddevils,3dfu4z,TheGhostOfBabyOscar,6,Thu Jul 16 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"But the thing is, the 'philosophy' is not air tight.  Fellaini isn't the kind of player who fits it either but he sure saved our asses on several occasions last season when things weren't going our way.  Sometimes you need that pure goal scorer who can intimidate a defence just by being there.  We've been missing that giant target man since Ruud.    Benteke is still young, same age as Lacazette who has had one standout season in Ligue 1.  I get why people want him for his pace but pace means very little when you've got 70% possession and are passing around/crossing into the box just desperate for that goal.  I don't think his finishing is much better than Benteke's and he's more likely to get bullied in the box in a league he's not used to."
reddevils,3dfu4z,simplyinnappropriate,8,Thu Jul 16 00:12:36 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the obsession around Lacazette either. I suspect it's mostly FIFA/FM players who just can't get over him.    We've been missing that giant target man since Ruud.   I'm just not sure we're looking for one, right now.   Also, Fellaini fits much more our system than Christian does, I feel. And he can adapt, as he proved last year, which I'm not so sure Benteke'd be able to do. Being good in the air doesn't mean you just can't play on the ground."
reddevils,3dfu4z,TheGhostOfBabyOscar,8,Thu Jul 16 00:27:35 2015 UTC,"Fellaini fits much more our system than Christian does   But I don't think ANYONE would have said that before this season, his credentials would have been just of, if not more suspect than Benteke's.  We sorely lack people who just get goals against the smaller teams who are parking 10 men in the box.  Benteke has achieved an impressive record in a tactically lacklustre Villa side.  I would welcome him into United's squad.  I agree with you that he doesn't fit the philosophy, but I think when you're looking at a 2nd choice striker it matters much less.  Thankfully Rooney isn't injury prone, so if we were going to sub on a striker in the 70th minute needing a goal, I can't think of a realistically better option."
reddevils,3dfu4z,simplyinnappropriate,3,Thu Jul 16 00:38:06 2015 UTC,"Maybe a small, tiny part of me just doesn't want him to be a second choice striker. Maybe I just want him to strive in a team in which he is the guy. He'd be an expensive bench warmer too."

reddevils,3dfu4z,MrCadwallader,4,Fri Jul 17 00:28:09 2015 UTC,"There is actually precedence for LVG using similar players.  Mario Gomez scored 53 goals in 91 games under him.  He used Huntelaar as RVP's back up sub, same deal Benteke could have with Rooney. Only 4 goals, but LVG did still give him 17 games.  At Ajax he had Kluivert and Kanu, two strikers that are far more similar to Benteke than Rooney.  At AZ he had Koevermans, who I don't think I've ever seen play but he's the same size as Benteke.  I guess another point would be, Benteke might be big but he's no Peter Crouch, he is quite mobile, good with the ball at his feet and not exactly slow. You look at the link from the Villa fan, all of his goals are about creating and finding space in the box, not so much dominating defenders. As the other guy said, we do need a guy that can put the ball in the net when there's 3 players around him."
reddevils,3dfu4z,kiac,2,Thu Jul 16 07:23:41 2015 UTC,"Just a small point. Kanu was really nothing like Benteke. He was never an especially physical player.  Yes he was tall and lanky and used it to his advantage but he wasn't dominant in the air, particularly strong or fast.   If I had to compare him to a contemporary striker, I'd say Berbatov. Like Berbatov, Kanu relied on his silky first touch, good technique, cleverness and composure."
reddevils,3dfu4z,MrCadwallader,2,Thu Jul 16 10:48:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree Kanu didn't really have those aspects to his game, the comparison falls apart even more with Kluivert who was more RVP than Benteke.  However I was trying to point out that Benteke is a bit more like that than we do give him credit for. He's no where near as reliant in the air as say Charlie Austin, someone made that slightly unfair comparison as he does have quite a lot of tricks up his sleeve like Kanu did. Obviously no where near the deft touch and agility in tight spaces that Kanu had for a big man though!"
reddevils,3dfu4z,scsajack,2,Thu Jul 16 11:15:48 2015 UTC,You're right. I was nitpicking but didn't even address your main point.  We aren't going to find many options better than Benteke. He would be excellent cover for Rooney. Unfortunately I don't think he'd be willing to be back up and at 30M he definitely doesn't represent the best value.
reddevils,3dfu4z,Surfacing710,2,Thu Jul 16 12:10:12 2015 UTC,"I think Benteke could be a great backup, especially coming off the bench. He is a physical presence and scores pretty often (48 goals in 100 games if I'm not mistaken). I imagine he could be a solid second choice just for how he changes the dynamic of the attack. Add in some good service and other attacking options to draw defenders off of him and he could be a 15-20 goal a season striker, even as a second choice."

But to PSG? Not like they speak any Spanish there too anyway in the city in general.   But if it's partly because he doesn't play? Then that's pathetic because he couldn't even be arsed to fight for his place and prove himself which is just rubbish I feel. If that's the case, we don't need such a player at all.   But if it's the former, then ok, it's understandable but still seems like he's taking an easier way out maybe."

If I signed for PSG first but then feel the league is low quality etc? That's my own doing because I knew it before signing and would have been incredibly stupid to assume otherwise and then be unhappy about it a year later.   Seems petulant if that's the issue."

reddevils,3dfu4z,-RedditGuy,10,Thu Jul 16 02:06:47 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with you there. At the end of the day, playing football is a job. You need to be happy where you are because your life affects those around you. If his family aren't happy to live in Manchester then it is a family decision to make whether to stay or go. We are a massive club. But not the only one. I agree PSG is one level down on us. But he might see it as a sort of project to help them get to our level. They could compete for the champions league just like us. The potential rewards are not so different. So if he's unsettled because his family hasn't got access to great restaurants or great weather or people with the same culture. Then that is completely understandable.   I'm sure he sees and know what United are about. He just needs to factor in other things when making decisions for his family.   I'm saying all this based on the rumours being true. As he said before he's excited for the next season and to impress and to make a name for himself. So let's see him do that."

If that's the case there are probably 3 teams capable of affording him: barca, real, and maybe atleti. The only possible outlet for him would be atleti since real don't want him back and barca are transfer banned (I think there's some clause in his contract that barca would have to pay a lot more to make that happen). Psg offers him a chance to leave along with living in Paris."

reddevils,3dfu4z,VictoriousPR,2,Wed Jul 15 23:08:42 2015 UTC,It seems that way. Would you be willing to take Ramos next summer (if he were to leave)?
reddevils,3dfu4z,incognito_red,8,Wed Jul 15 23:10:39 2015 UTC,"IDK. Ramos would be 30, approaching 31. And the later in your career the more age has an impact, and he'd still be really expensive. Plus, if we don't sign Ramos, I expect Otamendi this summer."

He'd look really silly if he made the transfer and then we got eliminated. Maybe we want to keep De Gea for that as well. Unlikely, but maybe the clubs have already agreed on fees and are just waiting until late August. Won't be ideal for LvG for integration purposes but if Ramos wants to wait then we'll wait, he's worth it"

reddevils,3dfu4z,uncreddevil,9,Thu Jul 16 02:14:02 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree about the strikers.   We havent seen Chich play under LVG, but he obviously didn't majorly impress or pique his interest before LVG joined/over pre-season, otherwise he wouldn't have been shipped out on loan and we wouldn't have got Falcao. IMO he is not the type of player to do well as a lone striker, he's too slight and lacks the technicality to create chances for himself. He needs support around him.   Wilson is promising, but only that at present. I'd love to see him get gametime and make a case for himself, but we simply cant gamble on him in some of the situations we hope to find ourselves this season (Champions League games, games deep into a cup run, PL games against the big teams).   Say Rooney breaks his leg, we would have some serious, serious problems. We need a backup who is at a similar level."

reddevils,3dfu4z,stuflx,2,Wed Jul 15 23:20:27 2015 UTC,"I really think we should look elsewhere for our backup striker,  My top choices are Saido Berahino and Griezmann.  Both would supply the pace that this team has craved for ages and solidify our striker corp for years to come.  While Benteke is an established scorer within the BPL, he does not have the hold up play that Van Gaal will demand from our strikers.  Saido is just as bad but is young enough to develop those skills and learn from Wazza. Griezmann is an excellent choice for striker because he does everything that Van Gaal would demand of him and should be our star signing of the summer."
reddevils,3dfu4z,osorojotx,3,Thu Jul 16 14:13:31 2015 UTC,I don't think Griezmann will come in just to play backup.

reddevils,3dfu4z,osorojotx,3,Thu Jul 16 14:27:26 2015 UTC,"I'd love having Griezmann here, but like I said, he won't be happy being on the bench. He's a regular starter at Atletico, and with the Euros next year, he'll probably want to play as much as he can."

This is a huge signal that Valdes will be gone soon  When asked ""why"" RVP was gone, LVG said that was a conversation between the two of them, and he wanted to keep that to himself. On Chicarito, he said he plays a 2 striker formation, sometimes 1 striker, and so he had to decide last year to loan out Chica and sell Welbeck, ""but now he [Chica] is coming back on July 25."" on whether Chica would stick around, he said ""we will see.""

reddevils,3dg0hn,SomeRandomGuy305,4,Wed Jul 15 23:56:04 2015 UTC,I think he'll join us after all we are bigger than any Italian club plus his mates live in Manchester
reddevils,3dg0hn,Rept4r7,2,Thu Jul 16 00:52:53 2015 UTC,"All I really know about him is that he was very, very good at the WC. In fact, he should have been the Golden Glove winner as he really had a lot more to do than Neuer did and he, along with the defense and Mascherano, were the reason Argentina made the final."

Progressive taxation wasn't factored in either (it's only 45% over 150K).. although it won't make a huge difference since we're talking about something like 100x the average wage.

reddevils,3dg0hn,omadanwar,7,Thu Jul 16 01:46:43 2015 UTC,"Well.... Yes and no. Basically it's a very very complicated system which we still aren't sure is totally right. Essentially you only get paid so much because both the government and companies know you will be taxed on it. If the government promised, for example, to reduce taxing YOU to 10% of your a millionaire and 2% if your poorer then you'd be happy yea?... Except the government needs to get money for schools, hospitals, army, roads etc from somewhere and so may tax your employer 75% and thus force them to pay you way less as their purchasing power decreases."

However, and I'll probably be unpopular for saying this, but footballers are notorious for saying things to get new fans 'on side'!  So I do try to take what they say with a pinch of salt. Having said that, it shows that being respectful to opposition players can pay dividends in the long term!  I think Ronaldo (the larger, Brazillian one) commented once on the standing ovation we gave him after he scored a hattrick against us.

reddevils,3df105,youreviltwinbrother,14,Wed Jul 15 20:41:37 2015 UTC,"Herrera didn't get even close to the amount of hype that Di Maria and Falcao did before the season began but look at who is getting the love now, not saying that Morgan and Basti won't kick ass next season but Darmian may exceed expectations and become a fan favorite."
reddevils,3df105,WizardsAndDucks,6,Wed Jul 15 21:13:22 2015 UTC,"I hope so too, not sure if you just watched the press conference but I think he'll become a big favourite, much like Herrera"

reddevils,3ddey2,slaystation25,61,Wed Jul 15 12:04:27 2015 UTC,"More game time, Ribery > Lavezzi"
reddevils,3ddey2,PhilJonesIsTheGOAT,36,Wed Jul 15 12:21:16 2015 UTC,Ribery is constantly injured though
reddevils,3ddey2,antantoon,40,Wed Jul 15 12:39:22 2015 UTC,Bayern fan here: At the time of his decision the injury situation was not that clear. If I remember correctly Ribery just got back from an injury or had a slight hit but was supposed to be otherwise fit and ready.  It's completely understandable that he wouldn't like to be a bench warmer at Bayern.
reddevils,3ddey2,flybypost,6,Wed Jul 15 13:25:43 2015 UTC,"Still, assuming Memphis is versatile enough to play both wings, between Robben and Ribery's injury records, he's pretty much guaranteed 20-30 games a season."
reddevils,3ddey2,GrapeBread,6,Wed Jul 15 16:22:29 2015 UTC,"Didn't work out for Shaqiri though, although probably different mindsets"
reddevils,3ddey2,TotalSHIT,3,Wed Jul 15 16:48:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think Shaqiri wants to be THE man like he is when he plays for Switzerland. He's a selfish player and that definitely won't work for Pep."
reddevils,3ddey2,GrapeBread,4,Wed Jul 15 19:44:32 2015 UTC,"Robben and Ribery's injury records   This part also would have guaranteed that he wouldn't be the only replacement. Bayern kinda got addicted to their inverted wingers and and are a hurting a bit when they are injured so MD being the only long term support isn't reasonable from the club's perspective.  The club is in a small transitional phase, some players are quite young (Alaba, Bernat, Götze, Thiago, even Müller) but they also have a few older ones who they depend on (their wings) and they need to sort that stuff out and that can only mean more than the usual competition as the old guard still function and want to contribute while the young replacements also want to play and can't just sit on the bench and hope for an injury (they can't just be ""in a pinch"" replacements but need to be competent and be able to get playing time against Ribery and Robben)."
reddevils,3ddey2,flybypost,3,Wed Jul 15 18:26:19 2015 UTC,Feels like muller has been around for ages. What a player
reddevils,3ddey2,Sabu113,2,Wed Jul 15 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"Don't even think about it, you already got one. Just turn around and look at other clubs for players to pilfer. ;)"
reddevils,3ddey2,flybypost,4,Wed Jul 15 23:44:27 2015 UTC,Ribery can't stay fit.
reddevils,3ddey2,lambomrclago,2,Wed Jul 15 16:11:44 2015 UTC,why would you risk someone getting injured for 1st team football though....

reddevils,3ddey2,jjkenneth,6,Wed Jul 15 12:11:16 2015 UTC,But isn't that because we pronounce it as if it were written could've? So why not write it like that? Same number of keys to press...

reddevils,3ddey2,GrapeBread,2,Wed Jul 15 16:27:40 2015 UTC,"It's because noobs heard ""could've"" and think ""could of"". Frustrates the hell out of me too, but it's mostly kids that do that. I assume people are u16s when I see that"
reddevils,3ddey2,kelevr4,3,Wed Jul 15 17:49:40 2015 UTC,"I always thought it first started with words like ""should've"" or ""would've"".

reddevils,3ddey2,IsleofManc,2,Wed Jul 15 12:32:11 2015 UTC,"It's not a new trend. People just make the mistake when typing it because when spoken ""seems to've"" sounds as if somebody is saying ""seems to of"" and not ""seems to have""."

reddevils,3dfq4e,danskzwag,10,Wed Jul 15 22:37:14 2015 UTC,A smarter manager would have studied our weaknesses in the last few seasons and found solutions quickly.

reddevils,3dfq4e,LucaRiolu493,9,Wed Jul 15 22:32:52 2015 UTC,Fosu-Mensah was. Not so sure about Milinkovic though. Thought he was brought in a couple of years ago and just loaned out.
reddevils,3dfq4e,D1794,4,Wed Jul 15 23:59:57 2015 UTC,May 17th 2014 - technically prior to LVG but LVG oversaw him being loaned back out to Vojvodina in August 2014

reddevils,3dl0tw,soccerman,9,Fri Jul 17 03:20:21 2015 UTC,Become good and move to Madrid? I have a feeling we wouldn't like that too much. But it would be great for him to have a break out season for us.
reddevils,3dl0tw,Sokkerboi,3,Fri Jul 17 03:34:52 2015 UTC,Bale was a full back then transformed into a super human winger.. think thats what he meant.
reddevils,3dl0tw,rawspirit,10,Fri Jul 17 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"Difference is Bale was a rubbish left back, Shaw is a very good one"
reddevils,3dl0tw,CornDogMillionaire,2,Fri Jul 17 05:04:40 2015 UTC,I know  I'm just poking at a bit of fun. I think Shaw is a great fullback. He might do well as a winger
reddevils,3dl0tw,Sokkerboi,10,Fri Jul 17 05:36:16 2015 UTC,Blind is a smarter player while Shaw is the better physical player. Blind can see what's coming and get in position to not be beat. Shaw will get sometimes get beat but have the speed to get back. I think Shaw should start as the brain is easier to obtain than the brawn. And from what the team is posting to social media it looks as Memphis is getting along great with Luke. I'd love to see that partnership become deadly for the next ten years.
reddevils,3dl0tw,Sokkerboi,17,Fri Jul 17 03:23:17 2015 UTC,"Shaw because he is an actual left back and looked a lot better than blind back there, he also brings more pace."
reddevils,3dl0tw,maydaybomber,4,Fri Jul 17 03:21:22 2015 UTC,"We'll see. We played really well with Blind there last year when we had that great run. Shaw is faster and more physical, but Blind is a more skilled and makes better decisions. I could see Blind playing in a lot of the European games where speed and physicality might not matter as much as it does in the Prem."
reddevils,3dl0tw,sayheykid24,7,Fri Jul 17 04:51:00 2015 UTC,"Shaw, he was unstoppable when he played there."
reddevils,3dl0tw,epicboar,3,Fri Jul 17 03:25:12 2015 UTC,"Shaw! He was signed for the LB position, whereas Blind was signed more for his versatility! Shaw, if managed properly, has the potential to become one of the best players in his position, and he has already shown glimpses. I would like to think that there would be some rotation. But first choice has to be Shaw!"
reddevils,3dl0tw,nikhilbhide,8,Fri Jul 17 04:17:36 2015 UTC,Is this even a question? Shaw should 100% be starting unless his quality seriously dips for a prolonged period.
reddevils,3dl0tw,Sub-Grumpy,5,Fri Jul 17 03:26:47 2015 UTC,Blind I feel better suits the system. Would be great if Depay and him could start for both united and the dutch team. Left side domination.
reddevils,3dl0tw,Junkrg,2,Fri Jul 17 03:17:19 2015 UTC,Shaw. Better defensively and provides speed down the left flank. No brainer IMO unless injured.
reddevils,3dl0tw,nickooj,2,Fri Jul 17 04:01:57 2015 UTC,"I'd pick Shaw 100% if both are fit. Shaw's much faster and stronger and is the long term LB for us. Blind, despite having the positional sense and linking up well with Young on the left last season, is a little lacking when compared to Shaw."
reddevils,3dl0tw,Nakabg,3,Fri Jul 17 05:27:38 2015 UTC,"Different matches require different approaches . If we go for fast counter attacking  football , we will go with shaw.

reddevils,3dl0tw,ivs_sege,3,Fri Jul 17 06:19:32 2015 UTC,"I think it's completely contingent on the opposition's right flank players, but generally, I'm more comfortable with Shaw."

reddevils,3dl0tw,ritwikjs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:04:12 2015 UTC,Shaw when he is fit and get's a consistent run in the team is a miles better LB than Daley Blind. If Shaw performs consistently like he did against Chelsea away last season then it isn't even a comparison.

reddevils,3dl0tw,endoplazm,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:20:33 2015 UTC,"Shaw. Slightly better defensively, faster, has more impact going forward...genuinely think it's a no-brainer if both are fit.  Blind was signed for versatility, which he will undoubtedly provide over the years, but if everyone's fit then I can't see a spot in the first XI for him, his competition in the positions he plays are simply better than him. With how Blind plays, I see him as a fantastic substitute to close out games."

It's the same when you see guys with huge biceps but they don't even curl nearly as heavy as those who have smaller biceps..
reddevils,3ddgob,DerpyNerdy,25,Wed Jul 15 14:33:26 2015 UTC,You make it sound like Bastian Schweinsteiger doesn't train his calves..
reddevils,3ddgob,Reddevilss,3,Wed Jul 15 15:17:04 2015 UTC,Never said so and that's not the right interpretation.. What I meant was that he doesn't necessarily have to train his calves harder than every one else to get calves that huge.. Genetics play a huge role in the aesthetic department..
reddevils,3ddgob,DerpyNerdy,5,Wed Jul 15 23:14:35 2015 UTC,Whether you've ever spent a long period of time being fat helps a lot too.  Nothing builds calves like carrying around a big weight 24/7.

reddevils,3dfirc,spoofex,3,Wed Jul 15 22:13:28 2015 UTC,"Jackson was sat dead center of a very small room. At the end of it, LVG pointed to that spot and started going off at him. It really couldn't have been anyone else as they all got up by that point and walked off. He also mentioned how he asks the same questions every conference, which Jackson has done (and an article about LVG saying Di Maria can leave, written by Jackson, was just published on Guardian as the conference ended)."
reddevils,3dfirc,spoofex,6,Wed Jul 15 22:17:21 2015 UTC,"Actually I don't think that's true.

reddevils,3dfirc,honey_pie,20,Wed Jul 15 22:29:32 2015 UTC,"Not much new to be honest. Van Gaal has said throughout his entire time here that he'll let unhappy players leave. Pretty clear Angel hasn't had a great time either, doesn't take a body language expert to figure that out.   I'd only let him leave if we actually had a suitable replacement in place. Makes fuck all sense to go after a guy like Cavani considering his main problem is Zlatan pushing him further out and not being played centrally. With Rooney here and if we play a 4-3-3 I don't see it being any different here. You don't spend that much money for a sub no matter how much you think they'll rotate."

reddevils,3dgl00,Syri0Forel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:52:51 2015 UTC,Benteke is the better player overall but Chicharito is a better third choice striker for several reasons including but not limited to:   He's prepared to sit on the bench and still be professional rather than feeling he needs to be playing week in week out His pace and acceleration make him an excellent sub for when defenders are starting to tire He is already settled and relatively proven as a non-main striker at this level.

If he is, absolutely. Knows the team, already settled so he just needs to learn more. Gives us time to scout for someone else for next season anyway.   If chicha is set on leaving or if LvG doesn't have plans for him, then definitely the other option by default plus also, not many better than him for that price too for this moment in time if we really are going for someone."
reddevils,3dgl00,ivs_sege,4,Thu Jul 16 06:59:07 2015 UTC,Chicharito definitely. Love the guy and with that midfield behind him he won't need to get too involved with the build up and can just use his pace and movement to stretch the play. He's more than capable of hitting 15-20 goals a season as second striker.

reddevils,3dgl00,BetweenTheCheeks,2,Thu Jul 16 03:17:37 2015 UTC,"I love chicha so I'm a bit biased.  But hear me out:   Chicha knows the club We only need a backup for Rooney LvG seems to play only 1 natural striker Depay and Mata, will all drift into the box (kinda like a 4-3-3)   All these factors make it seem like having one strong striker should be enough (Rooney). We would need only someone to come in when he is injured or over worked, for this I think chicha is better. He is really good at changing the game on its head (the impact sub). And Benteke is not the best you can get for 32mill.  I would give Chicha a chance and we have wilson to cover for him. Given only one striker being used, 3 strikers should be enough. I think Chicha is good as a striker enough to make it to our squad."
reddevils,3dgl00,kiwwi191,3,Thu Jul 16 11:53:08 2015 UTC,We only need backup for Rooney and already have Chicharito and Wilson. Do we really need Benteke for that? United fans become too greedy.

reddevils,3dgl00,AyyItsTheFonz,2,Thu Jul 16 03:02:43 2015 UTC,"Benteke, he's a proven striker in the BPL, did a decent passing job in the Villa team and can create his own chances. He isn't as good as Rooney in LVG's system but he's as close as we can get I think, and he has years on him to adapt, same with working on his build-up play.   I'd love to keep Chica but I can't really see LVG keeping him and I share /u/ballsywallsy's spoken thoughts on the matter, if he wants a starting role and he can't get it here then it'd be no-good keeping him around, he'd be unhappy and that would just be no-good for the team."

reddevils,3dgl00,Machr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:32:38 2015 UTC,At U21 he does but when he has appeared for the first team he's been ineffectual. I feel he will be one of those players where the jump from reserve to first team is going to be too great.

reddevils,3dgl00,M4NUN1T3D,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:47:46 2015 UTC,"It's a really interesting question for me - Chicharito is more limited in his skill set and more of a pure poacher, which is a worse for in our current system, but at the same time there were several occasions last year when his energy and finishing were EXACTLY what we were missing. There's also the fact that I love that guy.  Benteke on the other hand is the better all around player and on paper a better fit for our system. The thing I don't like about him is that his style is too similar to Rooney and doesn't provide much opportunity for a fresh approach/style on replacing Rooney (or pushing him to midfield), and it seems like tactically LvG is in favor of subs restructuring the approach.   I think I would rather have Benteke, but if Chicharito is willing to be our super sub again he adds a dash of chaos to our attack that has been lacking, and now that we have picked up some better distance shooters there should be more rebounds skittering around in the box for someone like Chich to slot home."

reddevils,3dgl00,empirechen,0,Thu Jul 16 02:52:03 2015 UTC,"If you don't consider price, I would say Benteke without a doubt, especially because he would provide something so different to what we already have (completely different to Rooney and Wilson), whereas Chicharito is in the same mold as Wilson (obviously Chicha is better but Wilson has a really high ceiling).   One thing I would like to highlight, I've seen a lot of United fans bashing Benteke and it feels like they feel this way, at least partly, due to Benteke's link to Liverpool (he'll most likely end up there). Just keep in mind we would be considering Benteke as a back up while Liverpool are looking at him as a possible main striker... There's no need to be petty and pretend Benteke wouldn't improve our squad, he would be a great back up striker (this is one position where we are not looking for a signing that's an improvement over the current starting player, with that said, 35m wouldn't make any sense)."
reddevils,3dgl00,Vetro777,-1,Thu Jul 16 10:57:51 2015 UTC,"Just looking at the two I'd have to say Benteke. Taking everything into consideration outside of playing ability, I'd say Hernandez.   Honestly I'd rather have Lacazette. Or a handful of others"

Remember when Ronaldo wanted to go to Real in 08? SAF says in his book that he promised him he'd be able to go next season as long as he kept it quiet, as he couldn't sell to Real at that time due to the song and dance we'd made about not selling. Ronaldo stayed and played a good season. If LVG is the man manager we think he is, I hope he uses a similar tactic. ADM's market value has dropped in the last year. I hope LVG asks him to stay another season and get his form back and put in the kind of performances that will drive his value back up to a level we're comfortable with. In exchange we'll listen to sensible offers next summer."

He said the same thing last week before we got Schneiderlin and Schweiny, so it kinda feels like the process he talks of is one of finishing a transfer; could fall through, who knows, might still be a united player, type of thing. he could be off. You'd expect if he was staying van gaal would just go ""fuck off, he's a united player"" or words to that effect. He didn't, and that kinda worries me. Think be Ed's flying back from Seattle to england when utd move on from there, so it'd probably be done by the end of next week I reckon, which is before the 25th, when he said Di Maria and Rojo would be joining the squad.

reddevils,3ddgti,D1794,37,Wed Jul 15 12:37:00 2015 UTC,I believe he said ''more than 50 million euros'' which suggests £35m would not be enough to get him (if Bayern where prepared to sell)
reddevils,3ddgti,thefatronaldo,17,Wed Jul 15 12:46:38 2015 UTC,"Even if it was a full 50 million euro, I'd rather put that £33m towards Lewandowski."

reddevils,3ddgti,Chemical_Robot,18,Wed Jul 15 15:47:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure why Lewandowski's agent said that. In today's market, £35m for him is a steal. He's worth way more. My initial thought about Benteke was that he's a £25m player. If you consider that he's an international for a decent team, scores goals, and relatively young, and then consider what Schneiderlin, Firminho went for, this seems like a decent benchmark for £25m"
reddevils,3ddgti,BoyWhoCanDoAnything,5,Wed Jul 15 12:50:33 2015 UTC,His agent probably values him at 35m but to Bayern no doubt they'd value him at double that.
reddevils,3ddgti,Isho,5,Wed Jul 15 12:53:54 2015 UTC,His agent said he would only be sold for 'much more' than 35m. Not sure why everyone thinks he's available for 35m.
reddevils,3ddgti,nicebike,3,Wed Jul 15 14:06:12 2015 UTC,"He said ""more than €50m"". People converted it to £35m, shit papers went with the story, now everyone thinks it's gospel."
reddevils,3ddgti,JGQuintel,8,Wed Jul 15 14:55:23 2015 UTC,Strikers always cost more as well.   In terms of players of perfectly equal ability you pay about:  Full Back/Keeper - £15m  Centre Back - £20m  Centre Midfielder - £25m  Winger/AM - £30m  Striker - £35m  For players of totally equal ability relative to their position.  Benteke is playing the striking equivalent of Darmian in terms of stature in the game but he'll sell for twice the price.
reddevils,3ddgti,JuanRiquelme,6,Wed Jul 15 15:17:55 2015 UTC,"Of course if Lewandowski was actually attainable for 35 million that would be a no brainer but that quote has no real relevance since there's no way Bayern would sell, or sell for that little.  32 million being thrown around for Benteke is because of a release clause. It's the same situation with Herrera. Perhaps the player is not worth that much but if you want him at this stage you have to pay the money.  Keep in mind Lukaku went to Everton last season for 28 million.   I would be really pleased if we signed Benteke. I think he would be an absolute beast now that we have a good team to be able to feed him. I'm quite happy whenever we sign premier league proven players. I also don't think there are many premier league strikers that are attainable this window. Berahino maybe but I think because he's English he would cost a lot of money as well. It would be nice to have some muscle up front."

He is definitely worth the buyout clause for us, so we will keep him unless of course it is matched. He's a 20+ goal a season striker and could be phenomenal, and that's why we value him so highly.   To those saying he's only worth ""25"" million and such, I'm not trying to make a jab at you, but you don't exactly know what you're talking about. It's not about what you value him at, it's about what we value him at. We value him as a 20+ goal a season striker, and therefore will only let him go if the release clause is reached.   :)"

reddevils,3ddgti,Chemical_Robot,-3,Wed Jul 15 15:50:29 2015 UTC,There is a possibility that Rooney could play behind him which could suit both players imo.  We could line up as ( apologies for formatting I'm typing this on mobile):  ------Basti-Morgan----  ---Mata--Rooney---Depay/Di Maria  ----------Beknteke  We tried something similar with Falcao/RVP last season and it wasn't working because they weren't the right players for that.  I think Benteke would excel in this set up.  Yes I realize there's no room for Herrera but I'm just saying this is one possibility. We can't expect Rooney to play every game if we are expecting to mount a decent effort in all competitions.
reddevils,3ddgti,7evenStrings,9,Wed Jul 15 13:20:10 2015 UTC,"Starting XI's rotate. Why does everyone seem to assume it'll be static for 40-50 games? Injuries, bans, exhaustion, mid-week games, form, etc. all have an effect."
reddevils,3ddgti,UncookedGnome,2,Wed Jul 15 14:03:43 2015 UTC,"But that's exactly my point. I'm just saying the above line up is one possible way we could line up.  OP stated that he has to be content with second choice, I'm just proposing a scenario where he doesn't have to be second choice and both him and Rooney could feature."
reddevils,3ddgti,7evenStrings,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:06:02 2015 UTC,"I really hope we don't use Rooney as a ten except for emergency situations. He doesn't have the control to dictate games at that position. At striker, world class. At 10 he tends to give the ball away at bad times."
reddevils,3ddgti,butterymobile,91,Thu Jul 16 07:35:54 2015 UTC,"He is a fantastic player, pace, power. Perfectly suited for the prem and with better service could be quite prolific.  I would be happy to see him come in."
reddevils,3ddgti,RedDevilNumber1,64,Wed Jul 15 12:26:04 2015 UTC,"People act like we are spending that much on a backup goalkeeper, it's a 2nd striker choice, he'll get many many games due to all the competitons, injuries, Rooney being rested etc."
reddevils,3ddgti,Takley,23,Wed Jul 15 12:36:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly. With Champs league qualification we will have a lot of games and rotating to do.  I remember a few games he has bossed our defence (not saying much the last few seasons) but he is a powerhouse and not too shabby in terms of finishing, plus he is only 24.  I have my fingers crossed for this one."
reddevils,3ddgti,RedDevilNumber1,7,Wed Jul 15 12:38:30 2015 UTC,"Almost every time we play with villa this guy give our defence all sorts of problems he is good all round player, i will be very happy to see benteke at OT and i think he will be a success plus he is also very good friends with fellaini!! lol"

reddevils,3ddgti,Vallle,21,Wed Jul 15 13:09:24 2015 UTC,Now that is bold. Don't think he'd get enough starts for us though

reddevils,3ddgti,mklose,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:40:23 2015 UTC,"If he got a run of form going he could easily keep Rooney out, or force him to play in the midfield."
reddevils,3ddgti,SignOfTheHorns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:25:17 2015 UTC,He could do a berba.
reddevils,3ddgti,lilpele,51,Thu Jul 16 02:47:11 2015 UTC,I really don't think we need him but I guess the fact that nearly all Pool fans would lose their mind if we got him might just be worth it!
reddevils,3ddgti,CosmicGravy,8,Wed Jul 15 12:22:29 2015 UTC,He's also previously favourited a Man City goal.....against Villa.
reddevils,3ddgti,mink_man,5,Wed Jul 15 12:38:55 2015 UTC,"How often is the asking price ever what they get for the player? This will likely settle around £28m. Benteke did them a favor and stayed an additional year so they won't be too stingy with him I imagine. I don't really see why everyone's jumping on that argument.  As far as footballing ability, Benteke is easily one of the most underrated strikers in world football. He would provide a lot of what we're missing up front. He's as capable as anyone I've seen that's available. Rooney will provide the technical ability and experience, Wilson the speed, and Benteke the size and hold up play. We would have a very balanced strike force."
reddevils,3ddgti,theatreofdreams21,2,Wed Jul 15 13:19:42 2015 UTC,How would you compare Lukaku to Benteke? Keeping the age gap in mind of course.
reddevils,3ddgti,Xanian123,6,Wed Jul 15 14:01:36 2015 UTC,"Benteke has the ability to be the better version of Lukaku in every category except speed. Lukaku is big, but he's not anything special in the air. Benteke is probably the best in the league in the air. Lukaku can hold the ball, but lacks the vision to do it effectively. Benteke's hold up play and subsequent distribution is, once again, probably the best in the league. Benteke displays consistent poise and finesse in front of goal that I believe Lukaku lacks. He has a terrific shot. Etc.   I rate Lukaku, but I think at their best he's a poor mans Benteke. Lukaku, for me, has already reached his ceiling whereas I think with some proper coaching and consistent game time Benteke has a lot left to show. His size combined with his technical ability gives him a distinct advantage that could make him one of the most complete strikers in world football."
reddevils,3ddgti,theatreofdreams21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:06:24 2015 UTC,"IIRC i saw a stat the other day that said Benteke's passes were not so good. Only 1 of every 3 passes found their destination. So, he is not that good a distribution."
reddevils,3ddgti,claudiouvm,4,Wed Jul 15 18:43:49 2015 UTC,"Hold up distribution is different. Lukaku often makes wrong decisions with his hold up play, but I've always been impressed with Benteke's ability to pick out the right pass after waiting for the team to move up field.   I don't doubt his passing stats aren't the best, but I also know that the further up field you are, the more difficult it is to pass the ball. As a lone striker, Benteke has to make riskier passes."
reddevils,3ddgti,theatreofdreams21,21,Wed Jul 15 18:49:48 2015 UTC,"Apparently we've been scouting him for a while, wouldn't be surprised if we ended up with him, although I'd be disappointed.  Edit: Benteke, if you join, prove me wrong!"
reddevils,3ddgti,StannisJr,52,Wed Jul 15 12:21:09 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be disappointed, I just would have expected better. A bit like my sex life."
reddevils,3ddgti,Isho,32,Wed Jul 15 12:21:49 2015 UTC,Hey at least we'll get something.....unlike my sex life 😢
reddevils,3ddgti,7evenStrings,9,Wed Jul 15 12:42:49 2015 UTC,Why would you be disappointed!? This guy averages a goal every other game in the PL while he's been playing for one of the most creatively inept teams in the PL.  I think he's a 20 goal scorer for sure in this league with the right service ( we have this).  Also there aren't many better options who are available this summer. No way Lewa or Benzema are going anywhere.
reddevils,3ddgti,tothecatmobile,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:25:19 2015 UTC,"One stat I'd like to mention, in 3 seasons in the PL, Benteke has scored 42 goals in 88 games. Last time we bought a striker from Villa, in 3 seasons he had scored 46 in 102 games.  I for one wouldn't be disappointed if we signed him, especially since Rooney will be 30 later this year."
reddevils,3ddgti,StannisJr,-5,Wed Jul 15 19:36:28 2015 UTC,"I'd personally have Berahino or Austin over Benteke. £32.5m for a second choice striker who happens to be injury prone. I also doubt if he can suit LVG's system. I think our second choice striker should be able to be relied upon at all times, and with Benteke's injury problems, I doubt that'd be the case."
reddevils,3ddgti,7evenStrings,3,Wed Jul 15 13:30:37 2015 UTC,"I like Berahino as well because he's still young so we could work on him but I'm sorry Austin is nowhere near United quality.  And as far as injuries go, I don't think he's injury prone. He had the major one before the world cup and he was out for a while but he looks to have come back ok from that."
reddevils,3ddgti,StannisJr,0,Wed Jul 15 13:45:43 2015 UTC,"Austin scored 18 goals last season for a dire QPR team. In the 13/14 Season Benteke had 4 injuries, and then in the 14/15 season he's obviously been injured also. I think he's likely injury prone."
reddevils,3ddgti,7evenStrings,3,Wed Jul 15 13:51:38 2015 UTC,He may have scored 18 goals but Michu did that a few seasons ago for Swansea. Doesn't mean they're united quality. We don't just need a bench warmer we need someone who can also take the reins if Rooney gets a long term injury.  Also he's had minor injuries yes but if you are just looking up players on physioroom you would consider half our squad to be injury prone. He had the major injury at the end of 2013/2014 and he looks ok since then which was probably why a lot of clubs have waited to see how he managed this season.  For what it's worth I don't even think he's on our radar so you can probably rest knowing we won't sign him.
reddevils,3ddgti,StannisJr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:21:03 2015 UTC,I think we've actually been scouting him for a while. And also according to skysports the odds have been slashed. This rumor may actually have some substance to it. I don't see we haven't been linked to Berahino though.
reddevils,3ddgti,penny_whistle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:26:06 2015 UTC,"Think the issue with high scorers in crap teams (and this could apply to Benteke as well) is that the whole team is set up around facilitating them scoring, whereas with bigger teams goals are meant to come from other players as well."
reddevils,3ddgti,The_Renovator,5,Wed Jul 15 16:01:34 2015 UTC,who better will come to be second striker on the bench ?
reddevils,3ddgti,StannisJr,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:24:56 2015 UTC,Alcacer? Fekir? Kane maybe?
reddevils,3ddgti,StannisJr,3,Wed Jul 15 12:28:19 2015 UTC,Kane? Backup?
reddevils,3ddgti,StannisJr,2,Wed Jul 15 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"True, what about Austin then?"
reddevils,3ddgti,Xanian123,6,Wed Jul 15 12:30:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely wouldn't mind him, could develop into something special with the right treatment. There is something appealing about Saido Berahinho too, can't put my finger on it though."
reddevils,3ddgti,doesnt_like_pants,5,Wed Jul 15 12:32:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah I mentioned Berahino earlier and apparently he wasn't deemed good enough. He reminds me Eto'o tbh, and he's only 21 which is an upside. West Brom would probably want £20m for him though.  Edit: He got 14 goals in the EPL, wow."
reddevils,3ddgti,mink551,2,Wed Jul 15 12:33:58 2015 UTC,"Berahino is fast as fuck, young and has good potential. We could use Agent Fletcher to drive him to OT."

reddevils,3ddgti,Takley,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:31:04 2015 UTC,Austin would actually be perfect for us in my opinion. QPR already said that they would sell him for 15 million which is a good price for Austin. Seems unlikely right now though.

reddevils,3ddgti,kiwwi191,2,Wed Jul 15 13:01:52 2015 UTC,you think he would want to come after having his best season to sit on the bench though?
reddevils,3ddgti,omegaxLoL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:13:32 2015 UTC,"He plays first choice for Lyon. Not exactly a top tier club. Considering both his and Rooney's ages, I would like to think he would be happy to learn and be the second choice for a couple of years at least whilst he improves and adapts to a more difficult league. He isn't ready to dominate in Spain, England or Germany yet so I think he could have a place here as Rooney's protégé. It wouldn't help Wilson at all though.  Then again I also think he would provide a mid table side a solid first choice option so maybe that would be preferable to him. He could up his market value in the EPL then move on to become a top first teamer in a few years."
reddevils,3ddgti,kiwwi191,2,Wed Jul 15 14:44:02 2015 UTC,Wilson. Already here.
reddevils,3ddgti,omegaxLoL,9,Wed Jul 15 12:29:05 2015 UTC,What has Wilson shown that makes him better than Benteke?

reddevils,3ddgti,doctorpwn,2,Wed Jul 15 13:14:06 2015 UTC,you're right mate. its important that we make sure the adidas money buys the glazers a new yacht rather than reinvesting into the club. its only prudent.

reddevils,3ddgti,TheDrySkinOnYourKnee,0,Wed Jul 15 12:34:02 2015 UTC,"Keep Chicarito as our backup. Why not? We know he can stick the ball in the back of the net, and at most we would get 8-9 million for him, so why not keep him, give him another chance, and if he excels, we have a new striker to offer a new contract to, else we sign big next year."

reddevils,3ddgti,Isho,-1,Thu Jul 16 03:59:15 2015 UTC,"Jesus.   Paying 32m for a backup striker just so we can ‘get one over’ on Liverpool is just pathetic.   We don’t need to spend that much on a Plan B.  Rooney, Wilson and Memphis will do"
reddevils,3ddgti,AndoSun,9,Wed Jul 15 12:41:14 2015 UTC,It's not like he's a dud. 42 goals in 88 matches in the EPL on a shit villa team and only age 24 isn't too bad for 33m. If Benteke pushes for a move I think he'll go for below 30m. Rooney and Wilson is not enough depth to cover all the competitions we're in next season. If Chicharito leaves we really do need to sign a striker. Wouldn't mind Benteke at all as a backup.
reddevils,3ddgti,George_Beast,5,Wed Jul 15 12:47:53 2015 UTC,"I don’t think he shite by any means. Think he would do well with the improved service with us rather than crumbs at Villa.  Said it before on this sub, I just think it will be hard to convince him to come over for a non-starting role. I like him, as he is a bit of a brute but unless the price comes down and he is willing to take a number 2 slot don’t think it will happen. (My gripe was directed at the people thinking it would be good to piss off the dippers)"
reddevils,3ddgti,Isho,3,Wed Jul 15 12:55:22 2015 UTC,"Didn't you see mate, he favourited the tweet saying he'd be backup to Rooney. Practically means he's coming!   But seriously if we get him and sign Otamendi as well, top 2 looks really good for us!"

reddevils,3ddgti,Muppetx,2,Wed Jul 15 13:18:47 2015 UTC,"Because he is a typical counter-attacking striker. Strong, has alot of pace, good in the air and good finishing.

reddevils,3ddgti,AndyG96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:24:58 2015 UTC,"His physicality makes it so you would think he has great hold up play and this is true if there's more space, like in a counter-attacking situation. In a situation where you are playing on the opposing team's half 80% of the game because of our high line and possession based style, a great first touch is mandatory.   I don't think Benteke has a good enough technique to operate in small spaces although he has the strength for it."
reddevils,3ddgti,Phyrion01,0,Wed Jul 15 14:43:47 2015 UTC,"I think he would be a great signing, if we could get him for less.  Benteke has always been one of my favorite strikers in the prem - he's perfectly suited to be a replacement for RvP; somewhat similar styles of play.  If we could get him for about £10 million less than what's being reported, I'd hope we sign him."

reddevils,3de1iq,6stringsoldier,19,Thu Jul 16 10:42:07 2015 UTC,"Matteo Darmian won't be Man United's biggest signing, but he will play a part  Matteo Darmian has never lost sleep after a defeat or before a game. Apart from one.  ""I woke up in the night a few times before the England game at the World Cup,"" the full-back admitted to La Gazzetta dello Sport in the spring. Everything was happening so fast. Relatively speaking, Darmian had come from nowhere in international football. His first cap for Italy had only arrived a fortnight earlier. A warm-up game against Ireland at Craven Cottage represented an opportunity for him to persuade coach Cesare Prandelli, at more or less the last minute, to take a chance on him and include the Torino player's name on the Azzurri's 23-man squad list for Brazil.  Darmian was impressive, but his performance and the rise that followed were a genuine surprise. Not only did he make the final cut, but all of a sudden he was propelled into the starting XI for Italy's World Cup opener, the rumble in the jungle with England in Manaus. Had Darmian slept the night before, he couldn't have dreamed of making a bigger impression. One imagines Raheem Sterling and Leighton Baines saw him in their nightmares in the days that followed; one didn't track back while the the other got pulled inside by Antonio Candreva time again.  It meant Darmian had the freedom of England's left side. He was a constant thorn in it. His combination play with Candreva even drew comparisons with Claudio Gentile and Bruno Conti in 1982 and Gianluca Zambrotta and Mauro Camoranesi in 2006. Understandably after Euro 2012, all the focus had been on Andrea Pirlo and Mario Balotelli and, on the night, they definitely didn't disappoint. But there was great curiosity about this hitherto unknown right-back who had caused England so many problems.  Watching from the sidelines at the Arena de Amazonia was their assistant manager, Gary Neville. As a former right-back, he couldn't fail to appreciate Darmian's display. Brother Phil also happened to be commentating on the game for the BBC. It's not too great a stretch of the imagination for him to have suggested Darmian's name in discussions with former colleagues at their old club Manchester United, either then or at some point in the past year.  As one of the few Italy players to exit the World Cup with his reputation enhanced, it was a surprise Darmian didn't immediately get a big move. High-profile interest was there, but with Darmian being mindful of how Torino had given him a shot and put faith in him when others in his career hadn't, he was willing to accept and respect their decision not to sell.  ""After the World Cup last year I said to him: 'Matteo if an offer comes in for you, I can't sell you this year,'"" Torino owner Urbano Cairo explained to La Stampa last week. ""I had already let Ciro Immobile [the Capocannoniere in Serie A] and [his striker partner] Alessio Cerci leave the club and couldn't afford to lose a third excellent player. 'But,' I promised, 'next summer, we'll speak again.'""  What will impress United as much as Darmian's full-back play are the character references they will have received about him. Other players in his position a year ago would have agitated for a move and pushed one through. But not him. Like so many footballers in Italy, he grew up kicking a ball around in the courtyard of his local oratory.  ""There was everything you could possibly need to be brought up well,"" he recalled in La Gazzetto dello Sport. ""Lots of fun to be had, sport, friendship, values. I'm talking about honesty too, loyalty and understanding how to get along with other people."" Darmian is grateful that the education he received was not only in mind, but in morals as well.  The son of a technical designer (""I like order and precision""), he might still become one once his playing days are over. Of course they began in earnest when a 10-year-old Darmian and three friends from the oratory in Rescaldina -- Salvatore, Roberto and Davide -- went for a trial with AC Milan. Even though he felt they all played better than him, Darmian was the only one picked. ""We're all still friends,"" he told Sportweek. ""One of them is a boiler repairman. The other still studies and the third has a kid.""  Funny how things turn out, isn't it? The only explanation Darmian can think of as to why he made it and his mates didn't is that destiny played a role and that it's his destiny to be a footballer.  ""In the first years I spent in Milan's academy, I was the smallest, the scrawniest, the least strong, and yet every summer a letter came through the post asking me to come back."" Darmian had his coaches intrigued. They tried him out in several positions, imbuing a versatility that he retains and will be much to the liking of Louis van Gaal.  ""In the beginning I was a central midfielder,"" he reflected in La Gazzetta, ""and if you asked me then who my idol was, I couldn't not answer 'Clarence Seedorf.' Then they started to play me in defence at centre-back so I watched Alessandro Nesta. They then put me out wide to the full-back position and there was only one person I could look up to, right? Paolo Maldini and that was it. And you know what then happened in 2007? Heck, I was in the first-team squad with Seedorf, Nesta and Maldini. To say I tried to steal something from them would be pretentious. Let's just say Clarence taught me what it means to have personality, Sandro elegance and Paolo how to be professional.""  As hyped as he was at the time, Darmian would only make four appearances for Milan. You have to sympathise. ""Matteo needed to bulk up and go get some experience elsewhere,"" Maldini explained last summer. ""Those were different times. It wasn't easy to find a place in Milan's starting XI."" Not with that competition.  Loaned to Padova where he broke his scaphoid (a bone in the wrist) and was then sold in co-ownership to Palermo, it wasn't until Giampiero Ventura signed Darmian for Torino -- then down in the second division -- that he got the regular game-time he needed to develop. What Ventura found was a player he could trust and rely upon. ""Matteo never misses a training session,"" he said earlier this year, ""let alone a game.""  The pair of them have been on an incredible journey together ever since. Darmian helped Torino return to Serie A and keep them up. He has been part of a team that has stirred emotions fans of the Granata haven't experienced in decades. They returned to Europe proper for the first time in 20 years and when they got there, Torino became the first Italian team ever to win in San Mames. Darmian scored in that historic 3-2 win, as he did in another famous, even more meaningful victory for the Toro: their first against Juventus in the Derby della Mole since 1995.  A popular figure, they'll be sad to see him go but Darmian leaves with their blessing and best wishes. There will always be a place for him in their hearts. As his talent flourished, Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi rued giving up on him too soon. ""We sold him for €1 million,"" he sighed. ""I reckon [Urbano] Cairo got a good deal."" United have too.  ""Three solid offers came in for him,"" Cairo told La Stampa. He wouldn't reveal the identity of the bidders but it's thought the others were Bayern, who are looking for an upgrade on Rafinha, and Napoli. Barcelona, whose current administration is advised by Milan's former talent scout Ariedo Braida, were also said to be considering Darmian as Dani Alves' successor, only for the European champions to extend the Brazilian's contract.  While Darmian does look to get forward as he showed so emphatically against England, his past as a centre-back means he knows how to defend too. In fact, Italy coach Antonio Conte redeployed him there in qualifiers against Malta and Croatia. A fine tackler, it won't be easy to get down United's right -- or their left for that matter, if Van Gaal chooses to play him there, as Conte has done more often than not for the Azzurri.  Now, a player's adaptability can often be a double-edged sword. It's true that they get to play week-in week-out, but not always in their preferred position, and that can sometimes lead to disgruntlement. Not with Darmian. With him, side comes before self. He's an altruist, comfortable in his own skin and with who he is.  Interestingly, Mahatma Gandhi is an inspiration to him in this regard. ""His greatness lay in using it only to the benefit of others,"" Darmian explained to La Gazzetta. ""I read about him, about his humility and simplicity, his silent protests, which spoke volumes as messages of nonviolence made history.""  Make no mistake about it: Darmian's quiet stoicism will be appreciated by United fans. Yet they'll be hoping that he does make a noise in England.  Darmian featured in my latest Serie A team of the season -- Juve's Stephan Lichtsteiner is better in my opinion, but there's a debate to be had about who had the better campaign -- and the question now is will he push Branislav Ivanovic and Pablo Zabaleta for that honour in the Premier League? Bigger still, have United finally found a worthy successor to Gary Neville?"

reddevils,3deb7v,TheJoshider10,2,Wed Jul 15 16:32:39 2015 UTC,This is absolutely vital for when we dominate and then we concede due to shocking defending on one of their fucking counter attacks.
reddevils,3deb7v,A_hiccup,12,Wed Jul 15 18:26:02 2015 UTC,"In most of his compilations, he seems to have a good amount of pace to burn to track back. I wonder how will LVG deploy him when we go up against Chelsea. Manmark Fabregas like Fellaini did which was returned in kind by Zouma. Seems like he could play a Park-esque role if need be."
reddevils,3deb7v,A_hiccup,2,Wed Jul 15 16:38:01 2015 UTC,I can honestly see him being used as a DM or a box to box and excelling. He does seem quite physical and he is pretty quick.
reddevils,3deb7v,A_hiccup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:39:17 2015 UTC,"I think the idea of DM is quite flawed. United, at least since k started watching footy never had a Matic, Coq, or Wanyama. Hargreaves yes, but for a small time. We have been successfull without CDM for years. Maybe we need to find a midfield balance and delegate upon who attacks and who stays back. Thus there is no pure DM. All three box-to-box but with varied degrees of freedom to attack."
reddevils,3deb7v,A_hiccup,7,Wed Jul 15 16:48:48 2015 UTC,"LVG's 433 plays with a ball playing DM / single pivot who sits in front of the back 4. DM's get forward as well from time to time, it doesn't make them box to box. Carrick / Blind played that role for us last season, and both had the freedom to get forward at times. Matic joins the attack with Chelsea the odd time too.  Probably because in our life time United have typically played with a double pivot in midfield, so both are usual required to be very mobile and both defend / attack. LVG (and loads of other big teams in Europe right now) like to play with a single pivot."
reddevils,3deb7v,daniam1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:58:40 2015 UTC,"Hmm. You are obviously right. Maybe we could mirror German NT? Schneiderlin being our Khedira? Considering that Schweni couldn't fit in well with Alonso as single pivot, I wonder how that will work for us?"

I'd imagine Alonso and Schwein would struggle because they're both pretty old and could maybe be outdone with pace, but Schneiderlin is pretty damn quick and very physical."
reddevils,3deb7v,Hassi94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:09:03 2015 UTC,"Considering they won the league and reached semis of CL, you obviously can't say that Bayern struggled. I saw a few matches with Thiago in midfield and few without him and the difference was obvious. Just not quick enough. Not the pace of players but pace of passing. This might be an unpopular opinion but I think Carrick, Schneiderlin and Herrera make our best midfield combo."
reddevils,3deb7v,Hassi94,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:17:16 2015 UTC,"What formation did Bayern play when those two were on at the same time?   I don't think they did really, which is one of the reasons Bastian decided to move - Alonso was keeping him out of the team."

reddevils,3deb7v,Hurleystix,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:19:24 2015 UTC,They tried playing Bastian as a CM with Alonso as the DM in a 4-3-3 but it was just too slow and it didn't work out well (they did this for at least 10 games if I recall).
reddevils,3deb7v,A_hiccup,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"When both were on the pitch Schweinsteiger usually played ahead of Alonso, as a box-to-box CM. It mostly didn't work too well because Schweinsteiger is no longer as fit as he used to be and the role requires high stamina, and also simply because he's much better suited to a deeper role. Playing both Schweinsteiger and Carrick might cause similar problems."
reddevils,3deb7v,mattmanutd,2,Wed Jul 15 20:48:28 2015 UTC,We played with a DM all last year. In the LVG model this is more of a link man than a destroyer. Though I believe Schneiderlin will be used as a box to box player who will graduate to DM once Carrick and Schweinsteiger retire.

You won't find him spread across every tabloid under the sun - he works in the background - and you know at the end of the day that if he wasn't there it would of been an entirely different game.  That's what I loved about Paul Scholes. He hated the spotlight. He just turned up to work on a Saturday morning, got the job done and went home."

He had his whole twitter tirade about '7 years down the drain' because they wouldn't let him leave.   As for this summer there could be a number of reasons he ended up at United over other clubs, but personally it wouldn't surprise me all too much if a decent portion of the reason was financial, both from Southampton and Schneiderlin."

I've read from a few articles that United was the only club he wanted to end up in the end. Arsenal and Spurs were interested again as well, but he ignored them. Also said that he wanted quick to get the deal done as soon as possible in his press conference he had at his first arrival at the club.

This is the tweet I was referring to, doesn't really sound like someone that's happy to stay and would rather be at Southampton than any other club but United? No? And something that has come straight from Schneiderlin seems more reliable than some article you've read but failed to source?   This summer maybe he preferred to go to United, but like I said I think a good portion of that would be a mixture of Southampton getting the best fee from United and Schneiderlin getting the best wages from United.   Ultimately though my point is that you're wrong when you say that he'd rather stay at Southampton than move to anywhere but Man United."

But my main proof of source is the press conference of his first arrival at the club, which came straight from his mouth. He wanted the move more to us than any other club, I believe that Arsenal and Spurs pulled out to sign him since we were in the picture and did not make an improved offer for him. I don't need to keep posting the press conference either on this sub because it's already on it."

They're a PR exercise where the player is going to be largely pandering to the new clubs fans, ""oh when United came in I didn't want to be anywhere else, it's a dream come true, I came here to win trophies, I was really impressed with the managers philosophy blah blah"", and I mean that about all players not just Schneiderlin. And not to keep banging on this point but a decent part of the reason he may have wanted United could have been the money on offer being better than the alternatives like I mentioned."

reddevils,3ddfge,doesnt_like_pants,5,Wed Jul 15 12:16:41 2015 UTC,Sounds like a consultant trying to make his product sound good.
reddevils,3ddfge,dracovich,7,Wed Jul 15 14:20:10 2015 UTC,"Leading performance specialist believes Man Utd manager Louis van Gaal will need to take steps avoid a repeat of Angel di Maria's first season at Old Trafford  Manchester United have been advised to appoint a personal coach for Memphis Depay to ensure the Holland winger's first season at Old Trafford doesn't flop like Angel di Maria’s.  Louis van Gaal has been told to give his £25m signing special treatment to avoid a repeat of Di Maria’s miserable campaign.  A leading performance specialist claims Depay could suffer a similar fate to United’s £59.7m record buy, whose form deteriorated dramatically after making such a bright start to his United career. Van Gaal has already warned Holland’s golden boot-winner that he will have to adapt to the Premier League.  And Ray Wilson, from sports performance consultancy Back 2 Action, says the United manager should take measures to help the Dutch international.  “I believe it would be good for him to have an individual coach,” he said. “Someone who can be around him and only him to assist with his performance.  “We see it so often where a player scores a goal and everybody thinks they’re great and has settled straight in and that’s what we saw with Angel Di Maria for example.  “Initially he’s on quite a high, but all of a sudden his performances start to drop.  “Did he have the right team around him to support him and get him ready for each matchday?  “The answer is probably no.  “So rather than making similar errors that were made with Di Maria it would be great to see a support structure around these foreign players so they can excel in the same way they did at their former clubs.”  Wilson was speaking to 888sport as Premier League players start returning to their clubs for pre-season training.  Depay secured a move to United after scoring 25 goals for PSV Eindhoven last season.  But Van Gaal immediately warned him that he will find life more difficult in England.  “He’s full of confidence - you hear it - but he shall notice it is not so easy,” said the Dutchman.  “In the Premier League there is a big difference from the Dutch league, always pressure on the ball, physical resistance high, so it’s not so easy.  “I have said that, but he’s full of confidence.  “He shall say what he is thinking, what he is feeling, but I know that it is not so easy.  “Also players like Rojo, Di Maria, Blind, they had problems. We have to give him time also.”  But Depay, who could be used in a more central role by United, is convinced he will be a success at Old Trafford.  “I’m excited to do my job for Manchester United to score goals.  “I’m a striker and I can score goals and give assists.”  Di Maria’s future remains in doubt despite insisting he wants to fight for his future at United.  The Argentine only started one of United’s last 10 games last season."

And this particular article makes a lot of sense. Memphis is a young player with a bit of an ego ,which is a good thing for his potential to grow into a superstar, and so therefore his ego has to be nurtured the right way in order to get the most out of him.  The case with di maria was that after the break in his confidence hit an all time low and we didn't have a team set to build him back up."

The Mexican spent last year on loan at Real Madrid and did not travel to Seattle with Louis van Gaal's 27-man squad for the pre-season tour of the US as he is on international duty at the Gold Cup.  According to the Daily Mail, West Ham have been interested since last summer and are preparing to make a move. However, they could face competition from numerous clubs across Europe with Wolfsburg, Roma, Besiktas and Galatasaray all linked with the striker.   Chicharito was a favourite of Sir Alex Ferguson, scoring 50 goals in three seasons in all competitions, but has struggled since he left, with just nine goals since before being sent on loan to the Bernabeu.

reddevils,3ddyy9,IchDien,2,Wed Jul 15 15:29:12 2015 UTC,"Really? If he scores against us it won't be the fact we only sold him for 8 million. It'll be the fact that we've spent £62 million on defensive players over the last two years and we're still conceding goals to mid-table teams. Out with the old, in with the new. The players we have now means balls need to be displayed and we need to win some bloody silverware.   EDIT: The point: It doesn't matter who scores against us, it matters that we concede goals in the first place."
reddevils,3ddyy9,macAaronE,2,Wed Jul 15 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"We're selling a player that, while I like him, has always been a backup option for us. We should not have to worry about him being a threat based on two games in a season. In the case of Chicharito, we should just sell him to the highest bidder. It's different if a rival wants him, but I would be fine for this price to West Ham."

reddevils,3ddvlo,eyeballer94,9,Wed Jul 15 14:39:31 2015 UTC,Why?
reddevils,3ddvlo,theatreofdreams21,0,Wed Jul 15 15:27:17 2015 UTC,£33m sat on the bench and a player who is the Fellaini of strikers.   I'd rather take Charlie Austin for half that price.
reddevils,3ddvlo,D1794,33,Wed Jul 15 15:39:28 2015 UTC,"£33m is the asking price. Teams rarely pay the full asking price. We'd get him for cheaper I imagine. He's easily worth £25m-£28m. I wouldn't touch Charlie Austin with a stick for anything over £15m.  I don't know why rotating players has such a bad connotation. He would start plenty of games depending on the matchup. Additionally, he would become a prominent piece as Rooney aged and he developed. He's still young and has shown that he's patient. Benteke can become a weapon unlike any other striker in the world.  To say he's the Fellaini of strikers is incredibly unrepresentative of his abilities. Pigeonholing all big men into a single category is ignorant; Benteke is one of the most technically gifted big men I've ever seen. On top of the fact that his hold up play and aerial ability is far and away the best in the league, he's also impressive with the ball at his feet and has finesse in front of goal that most players half his size don't have.   We're after a balanced attack and Benteke provides that. Rooney with vision, experience, technical ability, Wilson with speed and ambition, Benteke with size and hold up play. We would be incredibly balanced.  On top of all that, he solidifies our plan B/C versatility. Imagine being tied 1-1 with 10 minutes to go and us whipping in crosses to Rooney, Benteke, and Fellaini. That's a very scary attack when we're desperate for a goal."
reddevils,3ddvlo,theatreofdreams21,4,Wed Jul 15 15:59:24 2015 UTC,"We're after a balanced attack and Benteke provides that. Rooney with vision, experience, technical ability, Wilson with speed and ambition, Benteke with size and hold up play. We would be incredibly balanced.   Here here. We need to be able to provide different attacking strategies for different situations. Teams have learnt that sitting deep against us works because we've havent been able to break them down. A physical striker can be a great way of dealing with this because they can cause chaos in the box and fuck with the opposition's organisation. We saw Fellaini do it last season. It's not the most attractive way of going about things, but sometimes the situation calls for it and I'd rather we had a balanced selection of options as you say. Most situations, we use Rooney. If we're getting out muscled, Benteke would be of use. If we need pace to get in behind, that's where Wilson could contribute.   That being said, Benteke is more than just a target man. He has real pace and technical skill with the ball. I really rate him.   What also would be interesting is seeing how a big physical presence like him would affect the contribution of players like wide forwards like Depay/Di Maria/Mata. Player's like Benteke are magnets for defenders, constantly hustling them out of position, and ofter drawing two CBs to cover them because of their physical dominance. Wide forwards thrive in these conditions because of the extra space.   If you go back and watch Gary Neville's analysis when we beat City, he did a great job of explaining how Rooney was occupying both of City's centre-backs, and therefore opening bags of space for our other players to run into. This is something someone like Benteke would be great at."
reddevils,3ddvlo,daniam1,2,Wed Jul 15 17:19:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. You added most of my remaining thoughts about him. I think his presence forces defensive occupation which leaves lots of space for our midfielders. 1-2 defenders working on Benteke all game long leaves them exhausted and opens up lanes for our other great finishers to get open. Him occupying the CB's with Rooney behind him in the hole in space with the ball at his feet is mouth watering to me.  To further that thought, him being on the squad allows us to switch to a two striker system if the game calls for it whereas I don't think we could really accomplish it with Wilson. He lends a lot of dynamics to our attacking options. I really can't see much of a downside with him."
reddevils,3ddvlo,theatreofdreams21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:04:48 2015 UTC,I really can't see much of a downside with him.   Except the asking price :)
reddevils,3ddvlo,daniam1,2,Wed Jul 15 18:18:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah but like I mentioned elsewhere, I think that price will drop to around 28m. I also think that should he not work out in a few years, we could sell him for around 20-25m regardless of how he performs for us. He'd be 26 and just hitting the prime age for most footballers. Lastly, his comparatively smaller wages would help offset the transfer fee."
reddevils,3ddvlo,theatreofdreams21,10,Wed Jul 15 18:22:34 2015 UTC,"I agree. People are jumping on the bandwagon of hating him just for the fuck of it. They're forgetting that almost every time we face Villa, he single-handedly runs our defense ragged, and has scored a few crackers against us as well.  We need a fast fucking bull up front for certain games, and he'd be the perfect striker for that role."
reddevils,3ddvlo,Syri0Forel,2,Wed Jul 15 16:03:33 2015 UTC,I agree. Just because Benteke is big doesn't mean the only thing he does is play hoofball. His hold up play is at least as good as Welbeck's imo and he has really good game sense. 33 million might be on the higher end but honestly I think Benteke is good enough to be first choice for us in 3-4 years.
reddevils,3ddvlo,theatreofdreams21,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:03:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah and if he simply doesn't fit into the system, sell him in a few years for somewhere in the £20's. He's still so young that his potential will harness a lot of resell value. Plus, he would be on comparably low wages for us."
reddevils,3ddvlo,absoluteolly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:09:25 2015 UTC,"I like you bud, ive been trying to say this for a while with all of mt opinions on Benteke being shut down... I like you."
reddevils,3ddvlo,RadamelBirtles,-1,Thu Jul 16 05:25:43 2015 UTC,Is he worth €40M though?   I'm sure we could be better on the continent for £25M
reddevils,3ddvlo,Syri0Forel,6,Wed Jul 15 16:17:16 2015 UTC,"For a player who's scored 42 in 88 PL games playing for ASTON FUCKING VILLA, who create far fewer chances for their strikers than we do, I'd say he is worth every penny."
reddevils,3ddvlo,theatreofdreams21,5,Wed Jul 15 17:08:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely he is. There seems to be the pervading notion that because he plays for Villa he's not worth that much. Benteke is 24 and first choice for Belgium when healthy. He scored 23 goals in his only healthy (and first) season with Villa and bagged 15 last year despite being out for half the season.   Should he not work out over the next two years, then we sell him as a 26 year old for right around the same price. He'd also be on relatively low wages with us. I really don't see much of a downside."
reddevils,3ddvlo,tamasuperstar,3,Wed Jul 15 16:23:20 2015 UTC,I think it's absolutely unfair to call him the Fellaini of strikers.  Granted I think it's overpriced but he's performed well in an utterly dire Villa team and is actually very good technically for the most part.
reddevils,3ddvlo,mufcreddevil7,2,Wed Jul 15 16:52:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not so sure Charlie Austin is worth £16.5m. I might be able to be convinced if he signs, but I'd prefer we got a striker who would inspire confidence in a Champions League knockout fixture."
reddevils,3ddvlo,JuanRiquelme,0,Wed Jul 15 18:03:18 2015 UTC,£33m sat on the bench and a player who is the Fellaini of strikers.   This is an insult how?  Fellaini did loads of good stuff for us last season.  If Benteke is like Fellaini but also scores 15-20 goals a season that sounds pretty fucking good to me.  He's also very decent on the ball anyway. We could do a lot worse.
reddevils,3ddvlo,D1794,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:47:15 2015 UTC,Wasn't insulting him. However we shouldn't be looking to play that route of football.   The price tag is enough to put me off.

reddevils,3ddvlo,DecievedRTS,-2,Wed Jul 15 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"He is completely the opposite of how Van Gaal wants his teams to play. Man Utd should be going for a striker that can play the ball, has fantastic spacial awareness and is always looking to exploit pockets of space in the final third. Benteke is a physical defensive striker who harries defenders and wins battles in the box to score. He would stick out like a sore thumb in the system and fail to do anything. The reason Fellaini works is because his main game is finding that space (see back post always) but he can also keep and play the ball like you have to in the system and his movement off the ball and his spacial awareness fit into the system. He's just also very tall and can win headers. His goal against Tottenham was the perfect example of his off the ball movement and not relying on physical strength. Benteke would be a huge waste of money and would only suit B tier set ups such as West Ham or even Southampton but they've already got theirs in Pele. I would be happy to see Liverpool sign Benteke for all that money because in a team not built around his strengths he will be very easy to neutralise."

reddevils,3ddaay,Y0UJustL0ST,2,Wed Jul 15 15:42:11 2015 UTC,Honestly though how is Adrien Rabiot / Berardi not higher? I'd even consider Rabiot to have had an equally great season as Depay due to his amazing showing in the Champions League while Depay was playing at a much lower level...
reddevils,3ddaay,veddi96,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:45:47 2015 UTC,Hoijberg should be higher too.  And where the hell is Varane? I'm guessing he doesn't count since he turned 22 but he could arguably be number 1.
reddevils,3ddaay,TrollingPope,4,Wed Jul 15 19:41:00 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but that list lost me a bit when I saw Emre Can at number 12.  I'll admit I've only seen a handful of Liverpool games last season, and I believe he was being played out of position but is he really that highly rated?  Anyway, someone had posted an article from several years ago which had rated Anderson as one of the top young talents and see how he ended up. Not all of these players will make it for various reasons. Going by this list though I think we have got a very good deal for Depay and hopefully it pays off!"
reddevils,3ddaay,7evenStrings,6,Wed Jul 15 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's highly rated in Germany.   I watched him a few times last year and he actually looked really good in midfield. Brendan playing him in a back 3 against Fellaini isn't helping him, no surprise he looked poor against us.   When he's returned to midfield and allowed to develop, I think he'll be a good player for them, with potential to be very influential. He's excellent at ball carrying from deep. £10m was a really good deal for a player of his potential."

He's not an amazing player right now but he's a good one which in it's itself is impressive for a 21 year old."

Every time we talk about a back up striker, its either ""he is too good to play back up striker"" or ""hes not good enough"" or you suggest Charlie fucking Austin. /rant"
reddevils,3demrq,GGMU1992,4,Wed Jul 15 18:06:42 2015 UTC,"bc spending £32.5 on a player who no one on this sub would wanna see start every week for United is a gross mismanagement of money and resources? If Rooney is gonna play as lone ST in 4-3-3 formation 80-90% of all available minutes, where do you put Benteke? If we're getting a backup, we need someone who won't cost more than £20m. We can then spend what we save and whatever budget we have earmarked for a CB and get 2 CBs better than our options right now.   Chelsea had £8m Remy as backup to D Costa who is much less durable than Rooney,  last season and it worked just fine.   Tell me the £32.5m backup ST on Barca, Real, or Bayern? Barca and Bayern each have just one out and out ST. Instead they put that money on the pitch. What's the point of having £32.5m asset on the bench if Jones or Smalling is a starter?"
reddevils,3demrq,GGMU2014,10,Wed Jul 15 20:55:35 2015 UTC,"I'd prefer Aubameyang personally because of his pace, but I also didn't realize Benteke was only 24. I think part of the resistance toward him is due to the fact that he would be a little anticlimactic compared to Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, and Darmian."
reddevils,3demrq,bmg_921,12,Wed Jul 15 18:31:31 2015 UTC,I personally see Benteke fitting our system far far better than Aubemeyang.
reddevils,3demrq,tamasuperstar,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:08:17 2015 UTC,The only issue I see is he plays with things going through him mainly so he will need to adjust of course.
reddevils,3demrq,Feezbull,2,Wed Jul 15 19:27:43 2015 UTC,Absolutely. I think his hold up play and technicality will benefit our system and allow him to brings others into play.
reddevils,3demrq,tamasuperstar,6,Wed Jul 15 19:35:18 2015 UTC,"Benteke as a second option wouldn't be anti-climactic at all. People who are expecting a world-class striker are living in a fantasy, we won't sign anyone expecting more game time than Rooney, the captain."
reddevils,3demrq,Moosje,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"Do we need pace and acceleration? It's pretty clear that LvG wants to play with high possession. In my opinion we need a strong striker that scores when he gets the ball inside the box, and who can link up with the others.  Edit: I'm not saying that Benteke is the right option. I just have absolutely no reason to believe that a player Aubameyang would be a success for us."
reddevils,3demrq,nubijoe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:33:30 2015 UTC,Just really depends on who will be making the forward runs. As it stands Rooney's job is to pull in the CBs to create 1v1 match ups for the wingers to cut inside. I just think that Aubameyang gives us another dimension if those tactics dont work.
reddevils,3demrq,bmg_921,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:28:48 2015 UTC,"Also if it stops Liverpool from getting him, even better. Plus when Rooney's retiring he could take over easy decision for me"

reddevils,3demrq,TrollingPope,2,Wed Jul 15 20:33:16 2015 UTC,He's versatile like Lacazette where he doesn't have to be just a backup to Rooney and can play on the wings.  Anderson and Lacazette make a lot more sense than Benteke especially if di Maria leaves.
reddevils,3demrq,JustinC00,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:38:24 2015 UTC,I believe lacazette won't want to leave this summer unless he's a guaranteed starter because he wants to be first choice for the Euro's.

reddevils,3dfoqw,MrBenLad,2,Wed Jul 15 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"MUTV pundit Lou Macari has admitted he was taken aback after seeing new Manchester United signing Memphis Depay at close quarters for the first time on Tour 2015 promoted by Aon.  The recent recruit from PSV Eindhoven is expected to make his debut against Club America in the International Champions Cup clash over the weekend and is known to be a fitness fanatic in the gym. The 21-year-old is a striking figure in the flesh and looks capable of handling the rigours of the Premier League next term.  ""Memphis really has shocked me,"" admitted Macari to MUTV. ""He is built like a tank. I can't believe what I'm seeing. I thought he was a frail, little guy but he's massive and strong with huge legs!  ""The new signings will have a massive impact as there is real competition for places,"" he continued. ""I said watching certain games in the last two or three seasons that the bench was a bit weak but we're going to have the strongest bench of any team in the Barclays Premier League this season, especially with the midfield players.""  Meanwhile, Reds legend Bryan Robson feels Louis van Gaal could look to add another striker to his ranks before the transfer window closes next month.  ""I think we're not too bad defensively,"" said the former skipper. ""Especially, when you're getting the protection from the midfield area now. I look at it and feel we need another top-class striker. I'll be delighted if we bought one world-class striker into the club now and then I think the balance of the squad is very good.  ""You're going to see in the next few training sessions how the new signings slot in and where the manager wants to play them. I will take them time to understand what the manager wants but he'll put that point over and I'm sure they'll grasp it as they're all top-class players we have just brought in.   ""They will definitely strengthen us and it will be interesting to see how the manager balances it up with the formation that he plays,"" added Robson.  ""We can't forget Ander Herrera as he is in the mix as well. He finished the season off really well and it's giving great competition in midfield. There's also the good thing with Marouane Fellaini that he showed in the last part of the season that he can go up front and help Wayne Rooney out up top so it's great to have that asset as well."""

reddevils,3ddzjc,EastOfEden_,9,Wed Jul 15 15:49:02 2015 UTC,"With valuations like this, those new deals are normally included. What they generally do (if they do it correctly), is that they extrapolate the club's future cash flows and then discount them to the present date, with a given discount rate (it's a bit more complicated than this but you got the idea). So the cash inflow from new deals should be included. They may also compare the value they get with the fair value of the club's assets, but then you face the problem of evaluating a brand, which is always tricky."
reddevils,3ddzjc,BBQ_HaX0r,2,Wed Jul 15 18:10:45 2015 UTC,And the Dallas Cowboys haven't been relevant since the late 90's. It's more about brand recognition and following rather than quality on the field. I honestly don't think the new deal or a season out of CL impacts these valuations that much. These assets aren't that fluid.
reddevils,3ddzjc,musefanpl,3,Wed Jul 15 18:22:20 2015 UTC,"Quality on the field makes a much bigger difference in European Football than it does in the NFL. Play bad in the NFL and the most money you will miss out on is ticket sales of a few playoff games. In European Football you will miss out on UCL Prize money, and ticket sales for a minimum of 6 games. Also shirt sponsors will pay you less if you don't make UCL because their logo won't be seen in the competition, where as in the NFL they don't have shirt sponsors so it makes no difference."
reddevils,3ddzjc,BBQ_HaX0r,2,Wed Jul 15 18:26:53 2015 UTC,Agreed: See Liverpool if you need an example to support your argument.   I'm just saying one season (or even a couple) in or out of CL isn't likely going to vault us to first place. The brand is still strong.

reddevils,3dcxtt,hoppie00,20,Wed Jul 15 08:03:10 2015 UTC,"The focus is on Manchester United's new central midfield, but just as important is Louis van Gaal's ruthlessness with his current squad. The Iron Tulip is blooming...  You would struggle to find anyone inside Old Trafford claiming that 2014/15 was a rip-roaring success for Manchester United. It was a remedial campaign, a ship slowly steered away from the iceberg. After the David Moyes era lurched the club, however briefly, into disarray, Louis van Gaal's first role was that of fixer.  ""Now, I know for a club of this stature that finishing fourth in the Premier League is not something to celebrate, but I hope you will agree that it is a step in the right direction to getting this club back to competing at the highest level, both domestically and in European competition,"" was Van Gaal's end-of-season assessment, reflecting the mood of United supporters. Nothing to celebrate, nothing to weep over. Onwards and upwards.  This gradual, sustainable approach was always Van Gaal's preferred method at Old Trafford; he would rebuild the wall rather than plugging the numerous holes. Re-taking their place at European football's top table was United's sole ambition last season. Their top four place was celebrated, but largely with relief.  The coming season should see United mount a title challenge and embark on a run in Europe. By the end of 2016/17, the club's hierarchy will expect the Premier League trophy to be lifted. That four-year wait for the title would represent United's joint-longest drought in the PL era.  Having simultaneously cleared up after Moyes' sorry mess and thus lifted morale, Van Gaal's next task was to address the shortfall left by the Scotsman's own predecessor. Few dared to take Alex Ferguson's name in vain during his final years prior to abdication, but there is no doubt that he played his own significant role in United's recent decline.  For far too long there been a small pile of fluff, twigs and bits of old paper where Manchester United's central midfield should be. Phil Jones, Darren Fletcher and Tom Cleverley started a combined 38 league matches in midfield during 2013/14 under Moyes and Ryan Giggs. That is an embarrassment for a club of United's financial muscle.  That is why Van Gaal was only too happy to reveal his summer priority back in May. Eleven different players (Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Angel Di Maria, Adnan Januzaj, Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia, Ashley Young, Cleverley and Fletcher) appeared in central midfield in the league last season, a combination of injuries and poor performance leaving him almost continuously scrabbling around for an answer that just wasn't there.  ""No.6 is a key player, yes,"" Van Gaal said when discussing transfer targets. ""You have seen this season, for example, because Michael Carrick is injured and I don't have another, I have to play with Ander Herrera there. He did it very well, but it is not his speciality. I have played Wayne Rooney there also, but it is not his favoured position. That is why it is a key role, but I cannot discuss other positions because then I show too much.""  Since then, Van Gaal has found not one but two solutions to his problem, finally rectifying a problem seven years in the making. Bastian Schweinsteiger and Morgan Schneiderlin aren't the perfect additions and neither would trouble a current world XI, but they represent a significant upgrade. The cliché may dictate that 'attack wins games and defence wins titles' but, for Van Gaal, the answer lies in the middle of the two. United have not become instant title favourites, but addressing such an obvious Achilles' heel gives them a notable lift.  Crucially too, United have done their business early. After the farce of summer 2013, in which fake Spanish lawyers and missed minimum release fees played their parts in a comedy of errors, Ed Woodward has responded with a display of, wait for it...professionalism.  As Andi Thomas wrote recently, United have finally hit on competence; for so long with Woodward, that seemed like an unattainable ambition. Whilst other clubs have browsed the shelves, Van Gaal is already pacing towards the check-out.  However, there is another positive aspect to United's summer. Almost as important as United's transfer action is the ruthless streak demonstrated by Van Gaal with regards to his existing squad, crucially lacking under Moyes.  ""It shall be a rough summer for some of the players but I think a club like Manchester United has to be like that,"" Van Gaal said in May. He has stayed emphatically true to that word.  The biggest casualty is Robin van Persie, unveiled by Fenerbache on Tuesday. I wrote last season on how it felt the Dutchman was slipping sadly into the night, but Van Persie was given a forceful shove in the right direction by his manager. ""It is true because I cannot deny it,"" Van Gaal said in February. ""Robin van Persie cannot deny it, Falcao cannot deny it and Rooney - but he is not playing there so much anymore. But we cannot deny that at this moment we don't have a striker who scores 20 goals in the season."" Two of those three are no longer part of the squad.  Rafael and Victor Valdes have received similar treatment, both left out of United's pre-season USA tour. ""Now we are together again and he brings me another chance in my life,"" said Valdes in January - let's hope the Spaniard didn't grow too attached. Similarly, Fellaini and Young were two of United's best performers last season, and yet both are likely to be fringe figures given the club's new recruits. This is no time for sentimentality, however tough that may appear.  ""I was paid to keep winning, that was my job, so I was ruthless,"" said Ferguson the month after retiring. ""I'm not going to deny that. You have to have a strong personality when you're leading people. And I've got a pretty strong personality. I never doubted myself. Even in the dark days when I first joined Manchester United, I knew that what I was doing was completely right.""  It is this same willingness to make the big decisions that led United to Van Gaal's door. Van Persie, Rafael, Valdes and possibly even Angel Di Maria may all fall by the Old Trafford wayside, but the manager only has the greater good as his focus. His side look more like title challengers with each passing week. To tweak the Charlie Chaplin quote, the Premier League is a ruthless world and one must be ruthless to cope with it.  ""The Bavarian attitude to life suits me perfectly,"" Manchester United's manager famously said in his first Bayern Munich press conference. ""Bayern's motto is 'Mia san mia,' 'We are who we are' and I am who I am: confident, arrogant, dominant, honest, hard-working and innovative.""  Louis van Gaal came to Manchester to make history, not friends. Twelve months after his arrival, we are finally seeing the Iron Tulip in his natural habitat.  Daniel Storey"

reddevils,3dcxtt,hambodpm,7,Wed Jul 15 08:15:53 2015 UTC,"After the farce of summer 2013, in which fake Spanish lawyers and missed minimum release fees played their parts in a comedy of errors, Ed Woodward has responded with a display of, wait for it...professionalism.   Completely agree.  Good article, especially the points about being ruthless. Fergie was ruthless, van Gaal is ruthless as well, and this is what we need. The fans can be as sentimental as we want to be - but the manager has to be ruthless.  please don't sell Rafael :("
reddevils,3dcxtt,xtfftc,2,Wed Jul 15 10:27:05 2015 UTC,"A part of me thinks if Louis had succeeded Fergie in 2002, we'd have had at least one more CL.   It's an interesting thought exercise to imagine this: Stam would've stayed, Ruud would've had a Dutch manager, we wouldn't have signed Blanc. Riquelme would have joined us instead of Veron.... Might've been a very different team"
reddevils,3dcxtt,wordsmatter,4,Wed Jul 15 13:49:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting thought experiment. I'm certain it'd have been a different team as Ferguson has his own method of scouting which includes his brother, and word of mouth from his close relationships with other managers (e.g. Sam Allardyce telling him all about Jones).   We'd never have had Carlos Q as assistant as LVG would have had his Dutchies instead. This is important because Carlos is well regarded by a number of the players for the tactical evolution and defensive coaching which underpinned United reaching unforeseen heights in Europe (3 CL finals in 4 years). I'd be amazed if LVG ever does better than that at United.  Would we have signed Ronaldo if it wasn't for Carlos? Highly debatable. Apparently CQ used to sit in Fergusons office waxing lyrical about Ronaldo and Nani, Ferguson had his eyes on another Portuguese talent entirely...Ricardo Quaresma. Would we have won another CL without Ronaldo?   Things without Ferguson would have been different, very different. And most probably a lot worse."

reddevils,3dcwqn,jimmyjammaay,39,Wed Jul 15 07:49:19 2015 UTC,"All great managers have a ruthless streak.  Sir Alex Ferguson would make crucial, unexpected and unpopular and lonely decisions which he felt were for the benefit of Manchester United.  Roy Keane, David Beckham and Ruud van Nistelrooy were all surprise departures, big name players on top money.  Ferguson wasn’t on the Christmas card list of any of them in the immediate aftermath and while he’s fine now with Beckham and Van Nistelrooy, the fallout with Keane is still to heal. What matters though is that Ferguson felt he was vindicated.  From finishing third and struggling to score in 2005, United were European Cup winners and English champions three years later.  Louis van Gaal has shown similar ruthlessness this week. The focus of United fans is rightly on the four new signings: Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Memphis Depay and Matteo Darmian.  They’ve excited fans with good reason, especially as the club have acted decisively. There will be more. United want at least one more defender and a striker.  A new young goalkeeper is expected to be signed from Van Gaal’s former club AZ Alkmaar, though not as first choice.  There will be more departures too, with the goalkeeping department likely subject to several changes. Victor Valdes, left out of the US tour, is highly unlikely to be replacing De Gea as United’s number one as he once hoped – another key decision made by Van Gaal.  Robin van Persie and Nani have already left for the yellow-hot atmosphere of life at Fenerbahce.  Van Persie’s mind will be getting to grips with his swift and ruthless Old Trafford departure, but United needed his huge wages off the books.  And when he looks back at his career he’ll be able to say, among many other accomplishments, that he’s played in some of the biggest derbies in world football: Feyenoord v Ajax, Arsenal v Spurs, United v City and Fenerbahce v Galatasaray and Besiktas.  Not only that, he’s played a decisive part in them, not that City fans reading this column will share the delight of Reds when they recall Van Persie’s 92 minute goal in the December 2012 Manchester derby.  Van Persie always trained exceptionally well at United and teammates were staggered by his skill, but it was in games where he became less effective after that wondrous title winning first season. Van Gaal, however, didn’t question his compatriot’s work ethic like he did of some of the other players he’s let go.  For Van Gaal, who has to push United into serious challengers for trophies this season or his own reputation will be hammered, it’s all about the team.  If he feels that a player is cocky, arrogant, egotistical or moody then he has no time for them.  Nani and Van Gaal didn’t see eye-to-eye, while right back has been a position which has been troubling the United manager and his predecessor David Moyes.  South American players feel that Van Gaal has an aversion to them, from Juan Roman Riquelme at Barça to Radamel Falcao at Old Trafford.  Rafael will go along with that. The only surprise was that the Brazilian didn’t leave last August, but United left much of their business late because Van Gaal wanted to give every player a chance on the American pre-season tour.  He did that.  Things are far more settled this time and not only because United will stay in one training base for the majority of the trip.  United have signed early and signed well.  The club were confident of concluding deals before the four match US tour began and despite the impatience of some fans, they did exactly that.  The squad is still not complete and nobody will be reading too much into pre-season form given that United outclassed Real Madrid last August before losing at home to Swansea in the first league game, but Reds are understandably optimistic.  They see sense in Van Gaal’s decisions.  They just hope he’s called them – and the ones to follow - right."
reddevils,3dcwqn,G_Morgan,10,Wed Jul 15 07:50:30 2015 UTC,Roy Keane wasn't a surprise departure IMO. He faded so spectacularly that I think a lot of fans were dreading 3/4 years of Keane semi-retirement where he wasn't good enough. Sending him on was obviously the right decision in the cold light of day.  Keane did not leave because of an interview no matter how often it is said. Keane was moved on because he wasn't good enough anymore. The interview was just the trigger.
reddevils,3dcwqn,WillyMorganOnTheWing,13,Wed Jul 15 10:09:00 2015 UTC,"He faded so spectacularly that I think a lot of fans were dreading 3/4 years of Keane semi-retirement where he wasn't good enough.   That's not correct. Firstly, it was common to view that season as his last. He was expected to leave at the end of the season when his contract expired. Also, I'm not sure if you were there, but I definitely was when United fans were chanting his name in the games immediately after he left. The early exit in Europe saw a spike in those chants.    Keane did not leave because of an interview no matter how often it is said. Keane was moved on because he wasn't good enough anymore. The interview was just the trigger.   I think you'll find most people know the interview was the trigger. All involved have said so in public. It's just short-hand to refer to the interview as the moment it ended (as obviously it was)."

reddevils,3dcwqn,StannisJr,5,Wed Jul 15 08:07:24 2015 UTC,"Apparently AS Roma are close to signing Sergio Romero. Tbh I don't see why we're in for him, he's on the same level as Lindegaard. If De Gea and Valdes leave then we should sign Oblak/Leno/Perin and then either Sam Johnstone or Lindegaard would be 2nd choice."
reddevils,3dcwqn,Illum503,8,Wed Jul 15 08:15:30 2015 UTC,He's quite a bit better than Lindegaard

reddevils,3dcwqn,StannisJr,2,Wed Jul 15 10:24:43 2015 UTC,"Are we really using national caps to consider how good a player is? Obviously Lindegaard hasn't been in his national team, he hasn't had the chance to prove himself capable.  If Romero was a ""great keeper"" which he really isn't, then he would be playing at a top club currently, instead of being a free agent. We have De Gea and Valdes for now, if De Gea goes I'd rather have a young GK who can turn out to be world class."
reddevils,3dcwqn,s_D088z,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:36:24 2015 UTC,"Maybe Lindegaard wants first team football, Lindegaard isn't the type of keeper Van Gaal is looking for (he likes a particular type), or Van Gaal doesn't rate him. Could be any of them."

reddevils,3dd225,hambodpm,21,Wed Jul 15 09:04:18 2015 UTC,"I don't understand the pragmatics of this article entirely. What point are they trying to make exactly? It switches from a mocking tone to one of praise quite frequently and doesn't quite seem to have a point. Only time will tell whether Schweinsteiger will be a 'luxury' as is stated in the article, but I certainly don't see him as a luxury signing, quite the opposite in fact. He's pretty much an essential signing that we have needed for years. Every year we've gone out and spent millions on wingers without ever addressing the issue of the central midfield hole. Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger added to Carrick and Herrera now looks formidable enough for us to challenge at least on the domestic fronts."
reddevils,3dd225,LiamRS24,10,Wed Jul 15 09:33:55 2015 UTC,"I think the point the article is trying to make is that this season, compared to others in recent memory, we have made smart, shrewd and much needed signings which were more than overdue.  Whereas before (2013 and to an extent last summer too) we didn't really have any planning in place and just tried to get players for the sake of it. But I do agree the article is all over the place in terms of praise and scorn."

reddevils,3dd225,ChickenAllDayEvryDay,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:50:31 2015 UTC,"Indeed, I do disagree with him on the Schweinsteiger comments. However I do also personally believe that the lift he will bring to the club off the pitch will be more so than the lift on the pitch. Yes he will still be a great squad addition and play well in games, however it is the winning mentality and psychological boost given to his new team mates that will be most prevalent IMO."
reddevils,3dd225,Rs1000000,5,Wed Jul 15 10:28:35 2015 UTC,"I agree completely, the writer is basically using Verbosity to confuse the reader by using long words that would not normally be used when describing the transfer style of Man Utd. What they are trying to do is make you believe you that we haven't done good business because of the speed of our transfer. What they are forgetting in fact that it's only speedy in terms of the way the news is being released to the media.

reddevils,3dd225,mklose,8,Wed Jul 15 13:37:25 2015 UTC,The premise is false. The signings are directed at filling holes that stopped LVG from implementing his philosophy. It is a pragmatic implementation of a footballing philosophy.  The philosophy just doesn't have anything to do with the market.   There are many in Germany who feel Bayern will not especially miss him.    Because Alonso is keeping him out of the team.
reddevils,3dd225,tn1194,6,Wed Jul 15 09:49:22 2015 UTC,"The ""philosophy"" this article is referring to, is the transfer philosophy of clubs themselves, rather than LVG's own personal philosophy."

LvG never signs keepers that are not good enough to be no1, he believes the transistion from no1 to no2 needs to be as seemless as possible. He signed Valdes because he trusts him to take De Gea's place if he leaves/is injured. And that's also the reason we are still looking for a keeper that is potentially good enough to be no1, it's because one of Valdes/DDG is leaving this summer."

ADM is one of my personal faves on the team, but he's still questionable (to some degree.) I think even at his worst he's still pretty damn good, but there's no guarantee that he'll be able to thrive in the PL.   Cavani would be like Bale Lite. I would easily pay 100m pounds for Bale, but since that's not happening Cavani might be the next best thing. (And when I say the next best thing, I mean the next best ""realistic"" thing.

reddevils,3da0tj,Feezbull,27,Tue Jul 14 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"Read the mitten article about what LvG did. No bad blood perhaps, but definitely disappointment at how things ended."
reddevils,3da0tj,SluDge1,28,Tue Jul 14 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, RVP was lied to.  When he transferred from Arsenal it was with the knowledge that Ferguson would be managing for a couple more seasons but as it turned out it was 1 and done which was massively disappointing to RVP.  He grumbled with Moyes, which was reported, and considered a move last year but stuck around, likely becasue of the appointment of LVG.  Things didn't exactly work out this past season either through injuries and loss of form and I'm sure in his mind he's better than a bench player and asked out - and United obliged."
reddevils,3da0tj,Feezbull,15,Tue Jul 14 18:11:15 2015 UTC,No it's not that- it's how LvG told him in front of the squad that he wasn't ton play in a training match and to go and train alone. In front of the squad. That's what I meant.
reddevils,3da0tj,SluDge1,10,Tue Jul 14 18:17:45 2015 UTC,What I'm getting at is RVP was sold a bag of goods and stuck it out only to be disappointed again.  He's thanking Ed for understanding his position and allowing a move.
reddevils,3da0tj,Feezbull,4,Tue Jul 14 18:21:36 2015 UTC,Yes that's true but I'm sure he wouldn't have been happy with how LvG told him that too for now at least.
reddevils,3da0tj,SluDge1,3,Tue Jul 14 18:44:43 2015 UTC,Of course not.  He's a player that is used to being relied upon and if LVG told him that wasn't the case it likely would have been the final disappointment.
reddevils,3da0tj,Surfacing710,6,Tue Jul 14 18:48:19 2015 UTC,"I don't think he was exactly lied to by Fergie, he only decided half way through the season that he wanted to retire."

reddevils,3da0tj,CircleToShoot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:28 2015 UTC,"I think we need to face facts; RVP wasn't playing at the same standard. He aged under Moyes, dramatically. The way I see it is that he lost his drive after Fergie left, lost his flair under Moyes and banked on LVG to support him as a fellow Dutchman, to help him find his talent. LVG doesn't play like that though, and his allegiance is to the club and not the players.  While RVP scored some lovely goals this season, the pace of the game and the intensity of the regime was too much for him. Whatever LVG did to him, and however RVP reacted to it aren't based on a grudge or bad blood. They're based on RVP's capabilities."
reddevils,3da0tj,Fungi89,4,Tue Jul 14 21:31:18 2015 UTC,"RVP wasn't lied to. At the time he was signed, Ferguson had no plans to retire. It was only after the death of his sister's wife did he decide it was time to retire."

reddevils,3da0tj,SluDge1,0,Tue Jul 14 23:19:05 2015 UTC,I'm not suggesting it was malicious or that Ferguson knowingly duped RVP but he was told by SAF that he would manage for another 2-3 years - something that didn't happen (it's clear that RVP would not have transferred had he known that SAF would retire at the end of the year.  I would also like to say that despite the circumstances I believe SAF would have continued had United not won the league - but that's an opinion)
reddevils,3da0tj,evilthing,10,Tue Jul 14 22:09:57 2015 UTC,"Do you really think he would say something like ""yeah i'm pissed at LVG, I hope he would've handled this situation better"". RVP is a class act."
reddevils,3da0tj,Surfacing710,3,Tue Jul 14 18:02:44 2015 UTC,He is probably disappointed but to say that there is clearly bad blood is jumping to conclusions.
reddevils,3da0tj,MiLSturbie,4,Tue Jul 14 18:05:25 2015 UTC,"You got downvoted but I'm feeling the same vibe here. I have no info, but I feel like he wouldn't have said that if it wasn't to imply that someone else (LvG) wasn't as gentleman like. Difficult to say."
reddevils,3da0tj,mexicanpetal,3,Wed Jul 15 01:00:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know. I probably shouldn't have used the word 'clearly' but it seems like there has been a falling out. Last week, the mirror (which was sorta close to RVP) reported twice that RVP felt ""betrayed"" by LVG which was sort of confirmed by Andy Mitten's article yday. Also if you look at his comments on Social Media, he posted thanks to Fergie & Wenger, even posted their pictures on Instagram but there was no mention of LVG."

reddevils,3da0tj,Camorristi,60,Tue Jul 14 17:52:33 2015 UTC,"An official source finally praising Woodward. I think this goes to show all the people that think Woodward is being wrongly glorified are typically wrong. The guy is actually very good at his job and I don't see why people get annoyed over him finally getting genuine recognition for a change and shooting it down due to the stature of the club and manager.   I don't think certain people have the capacity to understand more goes on with transfers than just bid, contract, medical but that's FIFA for you. A lot of work goes on in the background and its guys like Woodward who do a lot of the legwork. Even with this he is clearly good at his job with the amount of sponsors we get too and even the kit deal last year."
reddevils,3da0tj,kw9403,7,Tue Jul 14 17:49:55 2015 UTC,Of course.  A guy who rose through the M&A ranks at JP Morgan would eat for lunch the average soccer president or equivalent.  Woodward vs Ayre is no contest for example.

The reason people don't like the circlejerk is purely because he's doing his job as he's expected to. We didn't treat Gill like this. Seriously, it's like he's a child or something and performing above expectations. I cringe at anything so ""wow well done Woody!"" because literally no other club treats the guy running transfers like this. Sure he should be applauded for the work with bringing in sponsors and for pulling off big deals (once again, his job), but not to the point where it feels more like a parody of itself.  I mean, I fucking love the circlejerk myself in terms of the gifs and memes, but I can't kid myself if I think it's because of anything other than the fact he has such a laughable face and name. He's the Ed Miliband of the football world except Woody seems to be doing his job right."

There's also been a huge improvement in the signings made and the swiftness which the fans are pleased about. He also works in an industry which depends on supporters, who are a vocal bunch. That is why he is getting the praise. If he continues to be as successful in each transfer window, the hype will die down and you can relax."
reddevils,3da0tj,i_dnt_always_comment,0,Tue Jul 14 19:01:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah and if Moyes was still manager I guarantee we would not be seeing Bastian Schweinsteiger rock up at Old Trafford, and I bet di Maria would have been in France last season.   Ed Woodward is not the most important part of our transfers. He does not identify the players we want to buy. He does not convince players United is the club for them. The manager is far more important. Ed is a commercial man, he opens the checkbook and talks to agents about wages and clubs about fees. He has virtually zero bearing on the footballing aspect, just the financial.   How people can fail to understand this and venerate him so much is indicative of how fucking dumb and circlejerky reddit is in general. One moron latches onto a simple idea and the rest follow. It's embarrassing. I used to think it was just a loud 12 year old minority, it's not, so many people here are genuinely thick as fuck and just like following the crowd. Downvote away I could not care less."
reddevils,3da0tj,frankowen18,2,Tue Jul 14 20:49:23 2015 UTC,"""Just the financial"" haha, as if money isn't important. LVG and Woodward both deserve praise.  I don't think anyone is saying Woodward is the most important component in the transfers but his role is not minor either.  As a utd fan, I wasn't only impressed with the signings, but it's the fact they've come early. What I'm pleased about is that I had little faith in Woodward being able to deliver (I've never had such doubts with LVG).  Also speaking of childish, why ask for downvotes? You know people vote on comments, so you didn't have to say that, unless you're actually trying to affect the voting of your comment? Suggesting that you do, infact, care."
reddevils,3da0tj,TheJoshider10,-6,Tue Jul 14 21:11:32 2015 UTC,"You haven't been around here much if you think nobody is saying Woodie is the most important part. Jesus you couldn't be more wrong.   My central point is that we're excited we signed Schneiderlin, Depay, Darmian and Schweinsteiger. Ed Woodward had jack shit to do with identifying those players, the guys we are excited to see play.   He signed contracts worth millions on behalf of arguably the richest club on the planet, what a genius. He signed pieces of paper and made offers, forgive me for not bending over.  He paid far too much for di Maria and sold Welbeck for well below his value to Arsenal at that time. I'm not entirely happy with his business, i'm happy that the footballing staff identified the correct players and he did his job.   I said that because i'm going heavily, heavily against the grain in this sub, so i'm expecting to be silenced out of the conversation. Who cares about reddit points, wtf."
reddevils,3da0tj,kw9403,-3,Tue Jul 14 21:21:11 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying that. I was replying to the guy who said people who say he is overly glorified are wrong, because that's not really the case. If everyone else at big clubs is doing the same shit, and aren't getting praised a lot for it, then surely Ed IS getting over praised (which I think he is). There's ""great signing, really happy with how LVG and Woodward have handled this"" and then there's the almost parody like comments."
reddevils,3da0tj,TheJoshider10,5,Tue Jul 14 19:15:54 2015 UTC,"This is what I said:   all the people that think Woodward is being wrongly glorified are typically wrong.   Him being glorified is fair. He deserves it, over the year he has made multiple sponsor signings and also this year especially has negotiated deals for top players well, for someone who negotiated a deal worth 30m for Fellaini 2 years ago to someone who got Schweinsteiger for 10m~ is one hell of an improvement.  The over-glorifying is a joke which has obviously gone over your head. I never said people were wrong for knocking the over-glorifying because it's just that, a joke. But you act like he shouldn't get any praise when he should, so should the rest of the staff that go unnoticed. I don't know why you're being so bitter over it."
reddevils,3da0tj,kw9403,-5,Tue Jul 14 19:34:42 2015 UTC,"What about all the signings made out of the club then where we got less than we could have.   It has not gone over my head. As I said in another reply, not all of it is a joke. If you meant that fair enough, but I also did not say in any way he doesn't deserve praise, my comments in fact said he should be praised but not to the extent some (key word some, as in, people who aren't joking) some are taking it.  Why am I bitter over it. I'm just having a discussion, just because i'm using full stops or not joining in with a funny circlejerk doesn't mean i'm bitter."
reddevils,3da0tj,geg0714,5,Tue Jul 14 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"United only sell when the player isn't good enough, if he's not good enough he won't get a high price, as simple as that. If you weigh up what we would have paid that deadwood in wages then it works out as a good deal. Look at the price we've got for good players who were wanted. Ronaldo world record fee, Beckham etc etc. We don't sell our best players like other clubs. Everybody knows this aspect of our transfer policy by now  The 1% who seriously over-praise him shouldn't be taken seriously, can't expect 100% of people to be metally capable, it's just how it is"
reddevils,3da0tj,TheJoshider10,3,Tue Jul 14 19:53:49 2015 UTC,"He is doing his job very well, why not praise him? Never heard anybody say don't praise Messi, he's only doing his job.  If somebody is doing their job well, they deserve the applauds.  I understand it looks too much, but I don't think most people genuinely belive that he is the best human being ever born, it's all just for fun."
reddevils,3da0tj,honey_pie,-2,Tue Jul 14 19:48:09 2015 UTC,"He is doing his job very well, why not praise him?   As I said already, praise is fine. He deserves it! He's got us a fuck ton of money over the past 2 years. I do think outside of the clear jokes, he is getting a bit too praised by some. I don't mean jokey praise, I mean serious praise. I just think it's a bit too much, in the same way people think some films are overrated by critics or fans or whatever."
reddevils,3da0tj,TheJoshider10,7,Tue Jul 14 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"..and our sales have been terrible. I don't mind a bit of praise for him where appropriate but FFS even Ferguson wasn't circlejerked over like this, it's a bit ridiculous and embarrassing at times."

reddevils,3da0tj,TheJoshider10,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:21:19 2015 UTC,"So basically only say 5 people can make the same comment for it to be okay? If 100,000 made the same ""well done ed"" comment why does it matter? They are all individuals and can make the same joke/comment or whatever, why does someone else' comment stop you from saying what you want? The level of praise should be criticised not the amount of people that praise, and even in that case, the over the top praise is a joke, you've missed, even if 1% think he's god it's 1% just get over it, not everyone is going to please you and you can't expect 100% of United fans can be level-headed"

It's the same as saying ""I don't think memes should be banned here as everyone can post what they want and make their own funny memes"" or something. I just personally just roll my eyes with the amount I see the same stuff. It's like when you go on /r/FlashTV and see non stop show related jokes, people just get fed up of it after a while. Nothing wrong with that. Some like it, others don't. I love the Woodward jokes and going Woody you magnificent son of a bitch to my friend after we make a great signing but then in discussion threads or social media seeing the level of praise over him just makes my eyes roll. Nothing wrong with that, and nothing wrong with someone who enjoys seeing the praise.   wishing I made this comment on the other discussion to avoid cluttering"

The Woodment stuff is funny so people do it and they don't feel stupid about it because he's genuinely good at his job. I don't think there's a genuine circlejerk of people thinking Woodward is the greatest vice-chairman to walk the earth. It's just a bit of craic in silly season.
reddevils,3da0tj,daniam1,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:02:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly it's a bit of both. Not everyone is doing it for the sake of joining in with a circlejerk, some are genuinely praising him as if he's God's gift to transfer negotiations. It's also been going on a lot longer than silly season, but back then it was funny because we'd take the piss out of how we sign sponsors and not players, now we make a signing and it's non stop ""wow what a brilliant deal by Woodward he really outdone himself this time"", and not in a jokey way."

Not taking anything away from Gill but he had the stability of SAF and the squad itself. This is why Woodward is being praised to an extent that Gill never was. Though, aren't we all calling out for him to be FIFA president? Didn't he earn that level of respect from us based on his performance at MUFC? Not to mention, this particular post focuses on his class in dealing with a rather awkward situation. Not often do you get fired from a job then praise the man who facilitated it.  Anyway, why would not want a chance to sit down at the circle? Plenty of Woodie to go around. Let's celebrate this window and get hype for this upcoming season!"

reddevils,3da0tj,TheJoshider10,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:13:34 2015 UTC,"Because some people think any praise is unwarranted, when in fact he deserves a lot of praise. People are saying he's a god, which he's obviously not, it's a joke chill out. But he's a very good businessman and deserves a lot of praise, the fact he is getting it and some people are being bitter I really don't understand. Some people are just always miserable though, piss on any parade for nothing.   because literally no other club treats the guy running transfers like this.   Thanks for proving my point. People in his position don't get the recognition they deserve, same as a lot of other staff at their respective clubs.   Sure he should be applauded for the work with bringing in sponsors and for pulling off big deals (once again, his job)   It's Falcao's job to score goals yet he didn't, we still applauded him and were even expected to and a large part of the fanbase wanted him to stay, double standards.   but not to the point where it feels more like a parody of itself.   That's the thing I don't think you understand mate, it is all a parody. The over-praise is a joke but he still deserves to be praised. People recognise he's a good CEO and take it too far as a joke but it doesn't mean he's not good at his job."
reddevils,3da0tj,kw9403,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:27:40 2015 UTC,"Not all of it is a joke though. I'm not on about just here, there's plenty of places where people are genuinely just taking it too far with his praise.   Falcao is a completely different scenario. By that logic we should have applauded Woodward in Moyes' year for failing to bring in people, when in reality many wanted his head for it (this is why I think so many praise him now really).   I'm not saying he doesn't deserve praise, I just think some of it that clearly isn't a joke is just pushing too far with the point and a lot of comments sound all samey with nothing being added. I love the jokes particularly the gifs on the Transfer Threads that crack me up, but some of it's just ""oh great another Woodward comment about how great a job he's doing"". There are people who overpraise him, and people who say otherwise shouldn't be regarded as wrong because of it. We all know he's doing a good job, it doesn't mean he's not getting overpraised. I feel people praise RVP too much based on the past 2 years, doesn't mean i'm wrong or anyone else is wrong for thinking otherwise."
reddevils,3da0tj,TheJoshider10,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:35:19 2015 UTC,"I'm saying the people who say he doesn't deserve praise are wrong, but also the people who think he's the sole reason for the transfers are also wrong. It doesn't make you right to say he does nothing because others wrongly over praise him. It's like saying someone says 2+2=5 and you say it =3 and that you're not wrong because other people went overboard, you're still wrong"
reddevils,3da0tj,dab2525,0,Tue Jul 14 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Well you said ""is being wrongly glorified are typically wrong."" and to me, as someone who thinks he's being praised too much, took this as a ""you're wrong if you think he's overly praised"". From seeing it as this, that's all I was saying is I don't think it means people are wrong as there's legit reasons why to many he is overpraised just like there's reasons that many think he's being rightfully praised."

And so we'll have no striker problem and van Persie will get to lift the Champion's League Cup whilst Messi once again is forced to face his and his team's defeat in a grand final. Van Persie goes on to become one of the great legends at Man United.

reddevils,3dcpor,donkoink,9,Wed Jul 15 08:16:55 2015 UTC,"The problem with England at the moment the way I see it is that after recent tournament failure the powers that be have decided to focus on younger players (Delph, Townsend etc.). While that is all well and good, these players should really be playing under-21 football and not senior. As a result you get both an underperforming senior and under-21 team. The likes of Michael Carrick, Rooney and (shudders) John Terry should be the base of the England team as they are two of the most experienced and consistent performers in the league system. This youth based focus is something which has been backed by the media, who have way too much power for the England team.  Furthermore I think the recent decline of England can be traced back to the departure of Paul Scholes from international football and the desperation of the English to fit Gerrard and Lampard into a 4-4-2 when in reality England didn't really have a top striker to partner Rooney to play that system. Again Michael Carrick was also ignored at this point in time.  Edit: And another thing, giving caps to players like Wilfried Zaha has devalued the England shirt imo. I could rant about England all day!"

reddevils,3dcpor,HuzaifaElahi,10,Wed Jul 15 06:26:58 2015 UTC,"I think he, along with the rest of the Liverpool squad that season really benefited from Suarez's form. He really did bring that team up another few levels on his own. That being said, people here talk about him like he's absolute shit, which I certainly don't believe"
reddevils,3dcpor,CornDogMillionaire,3,Wed Jul 15 06:45:35 2015 UTC,You can be an excellent player and be overrated. He's drawing hype comparable to say Giggs. His performances have been nothing like the devastation a 17 year old Giggs left in his trail.
reddevils,3dcpor,G_Morgan,66,Wed Jul 15 08:13:21 2015 UTC,"City: Touré. Lazy player with a cracking shot, when he feels like it.  Chelsea: Oscar. Flimsy attacking midfielder without an end product.   Liverpool: Sturridge. Any striker would have looked good when paired up with Suarez.  Arsenal: Özil. No, he hasn't adapted well to the Premiership, and he doesn't look like the player he was at Real Madrid."
reddevils,3dcpor,Calimariae,57,Wed Jul 15 08:28:45 2015 UTC,Yaya does seem to have lost his desire   bur a few seasons ago he killed it.

reddevils,3dcpor,mistah_michael,45,Wed Jul 15 07:29:01 2015 UTC,I'm sorry but Ozil has been pretty fantastic when not injured. He really impresses me when he's fit
reddevils,3dcpor,rayverine11,2,Wed Jul 15 14:45:53 2015 UTC,"I agree. Ozil's skills aren't something that show up on a stat sheet or are glaringly obvious when watching highlights. But watching an entire Arsenal game, you see where and how Ozil shines."
reddevils,3dcpor,Danimalbrand,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:25:33 2015 UTC,He doesn't score much but he is very capable of getting boat loads of assists haha
reddevils,3dcpor,rayverine11,16,Thu Jul 16 18:19:33 2015 UTC,Toure was phenomenal at his peak. Not convinced he won't be back after a summer off either.
reddevils,3dcpor,JuanRiquelme,10,Sat Jul 18 04:54:22 2015 UTC,Hopefully he'll continue being a shadow of his former self.
reddevils,3dcpor,Calimariae,7,Wed Jul 15 09:08:37 2015 UTC,He looked back to his best at the end of the season. Completely carried City from 4th to 2nd after we beat them.  I think he'll have a great season now he's had an entire summer off to rest up. The guy played WC into PL into ACON into PL and he's obviously not the fittest player in general.
reddevils,3dcpor,JuanRiquelme,6,Wed Jul 15 09:24:11 2015 UTC,Toure's old and lacking in motivation. His best years are firmly behind him. He was a passenger for City last season.
reddevils,3dcpor,ThatSnazzyGuy,12,Wed Jul 15 10:27:30 2015 UTC,Not entirely true. He was actually genuinely brilliant for City in the last few weeks of the season.  They were looking to scrape top 4 until he came into form and they strolled to 2nd place by the end because he was rolling back the years.  If he has a full summer off with no international tournament I think there's a good chance he has another quality season.  The guy was absolutely knackered from doing World Cup into PL season into ACON into finishing the PL season.  A lot of people writing him off already might look pretty stupid come May 2016 imo. He was brilliant in the run in last season.
reddevils,3dcpor,JuanRiquelme,3,Wed Jul 15 10:17:35 2015 UTC,"Well that's the thing with Toure, he can pull a match winning performance against anyone. It's just that his attitude is kind of rotten, and when he's not feeling it, you're essentially playing with 10 men, as it was for City during large parts of last season.  I wouldn't be absolutely shocked if he had a good season, but I believe last season was the signalling of a decline, and City would've done well to sell him. They're going into the season with an uneccessary risk if they have him down as a starter."

It's just that his attitude is kind of rotten, and when he's not feeling it, you're essentially playing with 10 men, as it was for City during large parts of last season.   By the end of the season he'd come good again and led them to 6 wins in a row taking them to 2nd. The guy is definitely not done.   I wouldn't be absolutely shocked if he had a good season, but I believe last season was the signalling of a decline, and City would've done well to sell him. They're going into the season with an uneccessary risk if they have him down as a starter.   That's ridiculous. Unnecessary risk? The guy might not quite be what he was in 2012 but he's still absolutely fucking miles better than the likes of Herrera, Fellaini, Ramsey, Cazorla, Oscar, Eriksen, Henderson and basically any other number 8 starting for a top 6 club who isn't called Cesc Fabregas.  Are all those clubs taking risks starting those players next season?  You are being absurd, players can decline a bit and still be brilliant. A Yaya Toure at 75% of his best is still the 2nd best number 8 in the league.  And he showed at the end of last season that he's still got it.  Someone like Giggs was in a steady decline for almost two decades after peaking at about 21, but we still got countless great things out of him. Players don't need to be at their peak to contribute and they don't need to be sold the second they're 'in decline'.  Iniesta is another player who's 'in decline' and he just won the MOTM in the UCL final."
reddevils,3dcpor,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:35:47 2015 UTC,"he's still absolutely fucking miles better than the likes of Herrera, Fellaini, Ramsey, Cazorla, Oscar, Eriksen, Henderson   In theory, yes. But Herrera and Cazorla both had better seasons than him last year. Ramsey could return to his form from two seasons ago next season. Eriksen might maintain his peak form from last season.  I don't think it's as clear cut as you're making it out to be.   And he showed at the end of last season that he's still got it.   Or he had a purple patch in an otherwise bad season. I don't doubt that he'll put in some class performances next season either, but the ratio of ""Interested Yaya"" to ""Can't Be Arsed Yaya"" is already favoring the latter, and it'll only continue next year."
reddevils,3dcpor,ThatSnazzyGuy,10,Wed Jul 15 10:43:51 2015 UTC,The problem with Toure is you need to put an extra player alongside him to actually play as a midfielder. It is effectively a team of 10+1 MotD player.  The best thing about Toure is the number of times opinion of his performances shift. People watching games readily reach the consensus he's been poor. Then after Lineker's lot have been on TV you'll see hordes of people suddenly claiming he wasn't too bad.  FWIW I'd pick Coutinho as the most overrated player for the scouse. He had one good period around the time awards were being handed out. Over the course of the whole season he was nothing spectacular.

It is effectively a team of 10+1 MotD player.   Definitely true in Europe where teams keep the ball and make you work to get it back. He just can't put those miles in.  But in the PL where it's more end to end and sides don't care about possession Toure has demonstrated beyond all doubt that he's perfectly fine as a CM in a two. City won two league titles and came 2nd twice playing that way.  Even last season he carried them from 4th to 2nd with some incredible displays in the run in in a 2 man midfield.
reddevils,3dcpor,JuanRiquelme,5,Wed Jul 15 08:26:07 2015 UTC,Definitely true in Europe where teams keep the ball and make you work to get it back. He just can't put those miles in.   Which frankly is where you separate the men from the boys.  I also think it'll be less and less viable in the PL as more teams are playing systems that control the ball more. I'd also argue that City won their two league titles during the trough of PL performance. The league is on its way up again now and I think they'll need to rethink to win another.
reddevils,3dcpor,G_Morgan,-1,Wed Jul 15 10:33:45 2015 UTC,"Which frankly is where you separate the men from the boys.   Nah come off it, you're being stupid. PL titles still mean an absolute fucking loads.  We had loads of great players play for us between 93 and 98 who didn't win a UCL and a load more between 2000 and 2007, or from 2009 to 2013.  Cantona was largely rubbish in Europe for us.  RVP was rubbish in Europe his entire career.  RVN scored a lot of goals past shite teams while never doing it at the business end of the tournament.  Were those not great players?  And Toure was actually a UCL winner with Barcelona in 2009 lets no forget.   I also think it'll be less and less viable in the PL as more teams are playing systems that control the ball more. I'd also argue that City won their two league titles during the trough of PL performance. The league is on its way up again now and I think they'll need to rethink to win another.   Maybe over the next five to ten years but we're not talking about that.  We're talking about 2015/16 and there won't be some massive leap forward between the last six games of last season where Toure was imperious and the games played next season.  He still easily has the ability to be one of if not the best midfielder in the PL."
reddevils,3dcpor,JuanRiquelme,2,Wed Jul 15 11:07:47 2015 UTC,"Nah come off it, you're being stupid. PL titles still mean an absolute fucking loads.   Of course it does but it is beyond question that it means more to be competitive in Europe.  League football is very different. In the league it boils down to who is best at punishing the minnows rather than beating the absolute best."
reddevils,3dcpor,G_Morgan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:42:58 2015 UTC,"Of course it does but it is beyond question that it means more to be competitive in Europe.   Sure, but you can be a phenomenal player even ever doing it in Europe.  And Yaya Toure has still been way better in Europe across his career than RVP or Cantona for example.   League football is very different. In the league it boils down to who is best at punishing the minnows rather than beating the absolute best.   Which is still a skill and is how Fergie won so many titles.   Toure does not need carrying in the PL, that's the point here."
reddevils,3dcpor,JuanRiquelme,6,Wed Jul 15 12:01:47 2015 UTC,"Yaya was a world class player, best CM in the league. Maybe now he has gone off the boil, but I wouldn't say he is overrated.   Oscar imo does have end product, scores quite a few goals and has a really good work ethic off the ball. Not sure if he is good enough for Chelsea but he is class.   Sturridge agree.   Ozil, hmm maybe this is his season. He hasn't been helped with injuries but is still top quality."
reddevils,3dcpor,eggaldo,23,Wed Jul 15 12:07:31 2015 UTC,Ozil was great once he came back from injury.
reddevils,3dcpor,mink551,9,Wed Jul 15 11:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yes he was, the last couple of games before the premier league ended he was very much on form, he and cazorla were very good,key players when sanchez was a not at his best!"
reddevils,3dcpor,IBENGM,2,Wed Jul 15 12:32:11 2015 UTC,Doesn't everyone acknowledge that Toure has been poor recently (arguably due to his age) and that Oscar is inconsistent?
reddevils,3dcpor,xtfftc,-10,Wed Jul 15 13:41:33 2015 UTC,"Ugh I agree so much on Ozil. He was bang average for ages, had a couple of good games and some 'sweet flicks' and the /r/soccer Arsenal mafia wanked themselves dry over him.   Hes an underwhelming player. Weak, barely contributes defensively (HE RUNS ALOT, LOOK AT THE STATS, HE RUNS ALOT) and isn't exactly a one man attacking force either.   He's good for picking a pass occasionally against mid table teams. Hasn't stepped it up once in any big game to my memory. Such an ovverated player. But you 'don't get Ozil' if you think he's pretty chicken korma apparently."
reddevils,3dcpor,frankowen18,47,Wed Jul 15 10:28:57 2015 UTC,"Henderson - average midfielder, nothing special - stamina is probably his strength  Coutinho - inconsistent as hell, not the next Silva or world class talent imo, wouldn't start for anyone in the top 4.  Clichy - poor defensively   Coquelin - not the second coming of Christ based on half a season - notion that he'd bench Schneiderlin is hilarious  Wilshere - inconsistent, could very well make it to the top and he has talent but he's probably Arsenal's 4th best midfielder   Kompany - how some still rate him as a solid CB is beyond me, far too error prone and has been rubbish at marshaling the defense  Oscar - inconsistent, like Coutinho, gets much less flak than he does just for tracking back.  Ozil - the fact that Arsenal fans have to try and see something world class in every pass he makes tells me he's not as good as they think and he's certainly below Madrid Ozil by a tier, even with the solid 2nd half of the season this season.  Bellerin - I rate Chambers higher, may just be me, but I can't see him being that special. Interested to see what others think of this one  Monreal - Koscielny made him look better than he is"
reddevils,3dcpor,HuzaifaElahi,47,Wed Jul 15 10:48:56 2015 UTC,"I rate Bellerin, he can dribble, go forward, create chances, not as good defensively though. Did well considering this was his breakout season and he's only 20. I'm going to love to see him go up against Memphis, haha."
reddevils,3dcpor,StannisJr,5,Wed Jul 15 06:30:56 2015 UTC,"Well, seeing as he had Hazard in his pocket, I'm guessing Memphis is going to be a piece of cake."

He's solid defensively, and going forward is pretty good. And he's only 20. Hopefully he has an injury free-season. I think he's one of the top 3 LB's in the league tbh"
reddevils,3dcpor,StannisJr,20,Wed Jul 15 18:03:42 2015 UTC,"The Chelsea game was an example of how good Shaw is, he was a constant thorn for Ivanovic and his speed and strength are remarkable for a kid of his age.

That was his worst performance, the Ox owned that flank. Maybe he had fitness issues during that match, Idk."
reddevils,3dcpor,StannisJr,16,Wed Jul 15 06:57:16 2015 UTC,"Disagree with: Coutinho, I think he's a fantastic attacking midfielder on his day - too good for Liverpool. Coquelin came good last year. He's not amazing, but he's filled a massive void in an Arsenal midfield with no defensive capabilities. Oscar is still young and has a lot of potential, he's shown his quality at times, but last year didn't always start."
reddevils,3dcpor,craigybacha,7,Wed Jul 15 08:04:09 2015 UTC,"I disagree with Bellerin and think Kompany can come back from a bad season.   However I am glad to see Coutinho and Coq gets a mention on here because they couldn't fit the term 'Overrated' any better.

reddevils,3dcpor,eggaldo,7,Wed Jul 15 08:06:40 2015 UTC,"I think Ozil hasn't reached the same level with Arsenal because he isn't often playing in his preferred position, and because at RM he was playing with better players around him"
reddevils,3dcpor,addodd,2,Wed Jul 15 09:39:09 2015 UTC,"Agree completely. Look at this and how Giroud almost fucks up for an example of what Ozil is working with. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIe-NtPjh0Y  Also Giroud generally isnt quick enough to make runs in behind, which is a bit of a waste of Ozil's skillset. Add in that Arsene likes to play center mids out wide and Ozil often doesn't have the runners available to use the full extent of his vision.  He's still crucial to Arsenal though, whenever he's injured or not in the 10 spot, Arsenal falls apart."
reddevils,3dcpor,Wheat-Thins,11,Wed Jul 15 11:45:18 2015 UTC,"As much as I hate to admit it, you're being too harsh on Henderson and Coutinho, the latter especially. Agree about Ozil though. Bellerin definitely better than Chambers."
reddevils,3dcpor,TheFormidableGiant,11,Wed Jul 15 12:36:07 2015 UTC,"Where would Coutinho start? Over Oscar for Chelsea? Doesn't fit the team as well as Oscar and is as inconsistent. Over Ozil/Cazorla at Arsenal? Definitely not. Over Mata or Herrera here? No thanks. Over Sterling or Silva at City? Nope.  I think Henderson is very average, what would you're counter argument be?  Fair enough on Bellerin, I think I'm in the minority that rates Chambers higher, still very early days to make the call."
reddevils,3dcpor,HuzaifaElahi,-6,Wed Jul 15 21:38:53 2015 UTC,"He would start at Chelsea, Man City and possibly Arsenal. He would start ahead of Sterling who looks like he'll be a starter. He'd start ahead of Oscar definitely, he's the least creative AM I've ever seen. Arsenal is debatable since Ramsey plays at RM now which would fit Coutinho better."
reddevils,3dcpor,mink551,16,Wed Jul 15 08:04:20 2015 UTC,"....no way does he start over Sterling, he doesn't suit the type of AM Mourinho likes and no way in hell he's better than Ramsey or Cazorla or Ozil."
reddevils,3dcpor,HuzaifaElahi,-4,Wed Jul 15 08:19:45 2015 UTC,"Yes way he starts ahead of Sterling, he's the far better player. With Oscar it makes sense but I still think he's the better player. And no, he wouldn't start ahead of Cazorla since they don't play the same position. Have you watched Arsenal in the last 6 months or so? Ramsey has played as a RM where he is quite average, I'm saying he would play better in that specific position. I never compared him to Ozil either."

reddevils,3dcpor,mink551,15,Wed Jul 15 17:50:43 2015 UTC,No. Why would Arsenal play Coutinho over Walcott & Ox. Coutinho doesn't eck a spot out in the Arsenal Midfield. It just doesn't work for him. Has nothing to do with him being a bad player or even being overrated. He just wouldn't make the grade.

reddevils,3dcpor,TheManyDickedGod,85,Wed Jul 15 08:15:21 2015 UTC,"I'd disagree with that personally, I think he's a quality player for Arsenal and England, it's his injury record that lets him down though, I think he'd be a lot more highly thought of if he wasn't permanently strapped to a hospital bed."
reddevils,3dcpor,Marshmallow_Fluff,37,Wed Jul 15 06:47:26 2015 UTC,"I'd agree here, we love to hate on Arsenal players, but Wilshere, when fit, is a class act."
reddevils,3dcpor,JayDeeIsI,18,Wed Jul 15 06:48:05 2015 UTC,He's underrated now for sure. England's best performing player of the last year.
reddevils,3dcpor,HerbertChapmansGhost,6,Wed Jul 15 06:24:51 2015 UTC,If Wilshere could go a whole season without getting injured he'd be amazing. He reminds me of Bryan Robson the way he plays and I'm afraid that's the reason he(like Robson) is frequently injured.
reddevils,3dcpor,kevin19713,16,Wed Jul 15 11:09:04 2015 UTC,Scholes hit the nail on the head saying that he hadnt progressed at all. A few years ago he was MoM vs that amazing barca midfield.

reddevils,3dcpor,Ipadalienblue,3,Wed Jul 15 17:28:36 2015 UTC,"How highly is he rated anymore? Everyone knows he has good technique and a ton of potential, but is constantly injured. No one has spoken about him as England's savior in 3 years."
reddevils,3dcpor,BigTomBombadil,-6,Wed Jul 15 19:30:27 2015 UTC,"He gets the hype because he (along with Carrick) are they only English CMs who have really high technical ability and are able to play the Spanish style of football. As Guardiola put it when he was asked after 'that game' about him, he has just as talented players in his reserve side.   It's funny how people still bring up his game vs Barcelona when it was only one performance."
reddevils,3dcpor,eggaldo,23,Wed Jul 15 09:16:59 2015 UTC,I disagree. He's been quite consistent when played for Arsenal this season even though he's often injured. Also been England's best performer during the internationals in the last year or so.

reddevils,3dcpor,beavon,16,Wed Jul 15 17:30:29 2015 UTC,I'm not even sure how you can believe that? Care to expound?
reddevils,3dcpor,Paolarbear,14,Wed Jul 15 18:43:44 2015 UTC,"Full disclosure I'm not a United nor Arsenal fan.  Wilshere has been by far our most important player over the last 2 years or so - since the Brazil friendly in Wembley.  He's absolutely got the run of the midfield and Hodgson seems to know how to set him up perfectly to free him to drive at defences and cause problems.   Rooney, as I'm sure you all know, hasn't replicated his club form for England, though he has been better recently."
reddevils,3dcpor,Ipadalienblue,-54,Wed Jul 15 21:27:20 2015 UTC,"Rooney has been shit since Fergie left, while Wilshere has been England's best player the last year without a doubt. If you deny that you're fucking stupid, because the only MOTM he didn't get was when Welbeck got one."
reddevils,3dcpor,beavon,20,Wed Jul 15 09:18:49 2015 UTC,"Getting MOTM in a few games doesn't make you a teams greatest player. Cahill, Rooney and Sturridge are England's best, and I hate Chelsea and Liverpool."
reddevils,3dcpor,TMillo,9,Wed Jul 15 09:23:09 2015 UTC,"No he's been by far our most important player since the Brazil friendly in Wembley. It's gone further than 'a few MOTM games', (which have spanned about a year now anyway - it's strange to write them off in favour of Sturridge who hasn't really made an impact and Cahill who has been pants)."
reddevils,3dcpor,Ipadalienblue,3,Wed Jul 15 15:22:51 2015 UTC,Please do not say Cahill is Wilshere level.   Sturridge has done hardly anything for England bar a World Cup goal.
reddevils,3dcpor,Camdento,-31,Wed Jul 15 09:28:46 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been a few games. It's been the entire qualifier, and thats a lot considering how often national teams play. When you constantly get MOTM for a year its not a fluke. Sturridge has barely played since Suarez carried his team, so who knows how good he is, Rooney has been shit since Fergie left and my pick for the most overrated player in the league, and Cahill is also shit. If you want to watch the difference in quality between Rooney and Wilshere, just watch the last game against Slovenia. Rooney missed a fuckload of easy chances while Wilshere scored two belters, but as I said; United fans struggle to accept it."
reddevils,3dcpor,beavon,14,Wed Jul 15 09:31:04 2015 UTC,"I couldn't really give half a midgets penis about the national team, but at club level i'd take Rooney 365 days a year over Wilshere and his cunts haircut and girl ankles. I can't even be arsed to elaborate, he's a superior player in just about every single way."
reddevils,3dcpor,frankowen18,6,Wed Jul 15 15:24:00 2015 UTC,"Rooney has stepped up massively since Ferguson left. It looked like he was heading for the exit, but he has proved time and time again that he is a work horse with an unrivalled passion for the club. Plus when playing upfront he can stick the ball in the back of the net as well."
reddevils,3dcpor,craigybacha,8,Wed Jul 15 17:31:59 2015 UTC,"Relax kid.  I think Wilshere is a decent player and will, hopefully, stay injury free and become an important player for England.  To say he's England's best player though is ridiculous."

reddevils,3dcpor,SarcasticDevil,11,Wed Jul 15 09:59:26 2015 UTC,"City: Kompany. Incredible in 11/12, hasn't reached anything close to that level ever since.  Chelsea: Oscar. Plays well for the first half of the season and then he disappears for the rest of it. Doesn't get half as much criticism as he should because he works hard and tracks back.  Arsenal: Coquelin and Bellerin. Reactions over Coquelin's half of a season in 14/15 were hilarious. Bellerin's quite fast and good going forward but I don't think he's all that good defensively. Debuchy and Chambers are better at the moment imo.  Liverpool: Coutinho. As inconsistent as Oscar (maybe a bit less), I still cannot believe the amount of praise he got last season, even managing to get into the team of the season ahead of Fabregas, for example."
reddevils,3dcpor,omegaxLoL,12,Wed Jul 15 09:25:14 2015 UTC,"Chambers is not better than Bellerin at right back. Chambers is the better defender, but Bellerin is a better right back"
reddevils,3dcpor,SunkenLoki,3,Wed Jul 15 12:06:47 2015 UTC,"Disagree on Kompany, was shit this season just gone, but season before he led them to the league.  He had weak partnerships the entire season and yet still managed to make a massive impact.  He made PFA team of the year in that season too.   Now if a Man U player made team of the year, winning the league too, I'd be massively pissed off if people called him ""overrated"" after a bad follow up season. Especially if said player had Mangala as a defensive partner.  He needs another season or 2 playing average/shit before overrated gets labeled to him.  Now excuse me while I go and wash my mouth out."

reddevils,3dcpor,jacksteroo18,1 point,Wed Jul 15 06:27:48 2015 UTC,Agreed. Put Cahill alongside someone who isn't a leader and doesn't tell him what to do and he would struggle.

reddevils,3dcpor,thehandsomelyraven,2,Wed Jul 15 07:47:45 2015 UTC,How is he regarded among you guys?
reddevils,3dcpor,jnwallac,3,Wed Jul 15 11:02:51 2015 UTC,"I, for one, think he is a great partner to terry. I think they have a great understanding of one another. They're no Terry-Carvalho but they were rock solid in the 13/14 campaign. Unfortunately on his own Cahill isn't extraordinary. You'll hear a lot of people say that most goals allowed come from our right flank, and they are mostly correct. Cahill isn't extremely fast so when the opposition burns Ivanovic he has to play catch up, something he isn't great at. He's not the best at organizing a defense by himself.   He had a pretty poor patch of form in the middle of the season that resulted in Zouma being introduced to the first time for limited minutes, and most people were generally pretty impressed. There was a lot of calling for a benching of Cahill for Zouma. It might have happened if not for two things, one being Cahill stepping his game up, and the necessity for Zouma to play in midfield to man mark Fellaini. He regained a bit of form and the calls for benching him died down a bit, but we by no means sing his graces.   Most everyone you ask, who's level headed and isn't just a complete knob, will tell you that Cahill will always be the lesser of a pairing. Which is concerning, considering JT's inevitable retirement.   EDIT: There's also a slight correlation between Cahill's dip in form and Matic's dip in form because, although Matic starts on the left he tends to cover a lot of the ground behind Ivanovic as well as Willian does too. But that's just some arm chair reasoning. I've only read inverting the pyramid and my copy didn't come with badges."
reddevils,3dcpor,thehandsomelyraven,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:48:58 2015 UTC,That's fair. To be honest I haven't heard much praise about him now I think about it.

Even playing Theo out of position as striker is a better option than Welbz. Too bad cause he's likable but he got a chance to start centrally for a couple months and was really poor. Pretty sure it was a panic buy cause Giroud died right before the window closed.

reddevils,3dcpor,ashish16luna,-1,Wed Jul 15 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"Great players make shit teams look great, that is why they are supposed to be great.   He consistently made mistakes which cost his team dearly, for England always selected in positions where Scholes/Carrick were better suited.  Also, the question was which player is overrated, he was a 7 out of 10 kind of player but was triumphed as 9 out of 10."
reddevils,3dcpor,BHButcher,5,Wed Jul 15 23:13:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, he's probably overrated but so is Paul Scholes with that argument. The thread took more of a direction of mentioning inconsistent or out of form players.  You cant blame him for England's incompetence. I did for a long time but then I realised I was being stupid. Scholes would have been the best choice but that came more down to playing style. Gerrard/Lampard never complimented each other.  Yeah, he has a few glaring mistakes over his career, no doubt. More often than not though, he was the one making things tick in their team. He was the one digging in winning points single handedly that they never had any business winning. 7/10 is a ridiculously biased and harsh rating of his career."

Maybe Oscar? He's underwhelming but I don't anyone that rates him as a word beater  City Vinnie k - been living off his reputation for a bit but he's still capable of class  Arsenal Ramsey/Wilshire - both capable of real class but both are still inconsistent."

A lot of journalists and pundits were making him out to be clearly the best player in the Prem and a contender for the Ballon d'Or. In reality, Hazard wasn't any better than several other attackers, particularly Costa, Fabregas, Sanchez, and especially Aguero.   Hazard was tied for 6th in goals and tied for 6th in assists. His combined total of 23 points dwindles in comparison to Aguero's 34 points. Besides that, his team's success was built on organization and defense, which he didn't help much with.  Sure, he's good and he turned up big for Chelski a few times. But he isn't the sole reason they did well, and I don't think he should be anywhere near any individual awards."

All the Arsenal fans want a new striker so Giroud can play back up but he's proven he is first team quality. He just needs to stay off the physio table and he needs a decent back up so he doesn't get burnt out.

The former has had one bad season, he's also getting old and tired, but is by no means 'past it'. Without Willian (the man who effectively ousted mata) there'd be a lot more pressure on Hazard and the balance that served them so well, would've been gone.

We stood our ground and didn't allow them to dictate terms. I hope though De Gea saw Casillas press conference and realized what a mistake it would be."
reddevils,3dccz8,x54527,18,Wed Jul 15 04:16:18 2015 UTC,Any chance you could give me a TL;DR on Casillas' press conference?
reddevils,3dccz8,dekx11,35,Wed Jul 15 05:02:42 2015 UTC,Casillas got unfollowed by the official Twitter of Real Madrid at his farewell was basically the fans shouting that Ramos is not for sale
reddevils,3dccz8,muddyfarmer18,6,Wed Jul 15 05:16:30 2015 UTC,"Ah, I see. Thanks."
reddevils,3dccz8,dekx11,32,Wed Jul 15 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"What a onesided and uninformed comment. Sure it wasn't what it should have been, but there where so many ""Iker"" shouts that he started to cry. And for the unfollowing, I can't believe that this is even a topic football fans talk about. Real Madrids twitter has a strict policy of only following current players and unfollowed every player that left immediately. Can't believe I am even typing this out."
reddevils,3dccz8,moklboy,15,Wed Jul 15 06:22:08 2015 UTC,"This is far from the whole story Real weren't even going to give Casillias a proper goodbye it was only arranged last minute under pressure from the fans. That's why the atmosphere was reportedly odd fans were shouting: “Stand down, Florentino.” “Ramos isn’t for sale!” “Floren, we want you in the fucking street.""   It was mostly in response to the terrible way real had handled selling their longest serving player.

reddevils,3dccz8,Snaaak,-18,Wed Jul 15 10:14:54 2015 UTC,"Once again, Madrid fans aren't that bad. They want the best and don't settle. Casillas was meddling in the last few years so he was no angel.  In my experience, any player who has been boo'd has had some sort of a reason. (Yes most clubs wouldn't boo but Real are different, the fans run the show.) If they think Bale is playing for himself, then they'll let him know.  The majority of the players have not had any bad support from the fans."
reddevils,3dccz8,mink_man,18,Wed Jul 15 07:07:29 2015 UTC,"Yes they are, they are a bunch of spoilt wankers. The amount of cocky Madrid fans on /r/soccer is unbelievable.  And you should never boo your own player if he's playing bad."
reddevils,3dccz8,Neck_Beard_Slayer,4,Wed Jul 15 07:37:45 2015 UTC,It's not just on reddit. They abused Bale as he drove off from a game. No respect.

reddevils,3dccz8,aman27deep,8,Wed Jul 15 08:06:05 2015 UTC,"A small section of fans booed fellaini, just like a small number of fans paid for that fucking stupid plane to fly over Old Trafford. Don't forget that the fans stood by David Moyes till the very end despite the misery. Cassilas had an entire section behind his goal booing him, there's a difference."
reddevils,3dccz8,JacksFieryVengeance,-6,Wed Jul 15 08:20:44 2015 UTC,"Yes, the fans stood by Moyes and that's great but would you rather stand by the manager and finish 7th every year or demand success?  Maybe if Utd fans didn't stand by him and got him the boot in February we might have got champs league, who knows.   Yes, supporting the players/managers in bad times is the fairest thing to do but Madrid fans demand the best and you have to admire them for that in a way. They demand the players do right by the club which is right.   Casillas wasn't just a youth product of 17 years or whatever, he was messing the club around in the background."
reddevils,3dccz8,mink_man,2,Wed Jul 15 08:45:33 2015 UTC,"Let's not act like Casillas' booing was because he was meddling in club affairs( the mourinho situation) because Ramos was as guilty as Casillas in that situation. No one in Madrid booed Ramos because he played well, whereas Casillas made a few mistakes. Casillas was by no means a bad keeper last season but they booed him because of those mistakes he made. Booing a player is literally the worst thing you can do to someone who is already low on confidence, which is what RM fans do to players who don't perform upto their lofty expectations."
reddevils,3dccz8,JacksFieryVengeance,2,Wed Jul 15 08:56:57 2015 UTC,There's no way you're comparing some of us booing Fellaini to Real Madrid fans consistently whistling at a club legend that's been with the club since he was 9.

reddevils,3dccz8,JacksFieryVengeance,0,Wed Jul 15 08:24:08 2015 UTC,"And the difference between social media and in the stadium is?   The fact is none of our players have meddled in club affairs like casillas or played for themselves instead of the team like Ronaldo or Bale.  Tell me, when was the last time Pepe, Marcelo, Varane, Modric, Khedira, Isco, Kroos or James got boo'd?"
reddevils,3dccz8,mink_man,2,Wed Jul 15 08:38:29 2015 UTC,"The difference between social media and the stadium is there are 1000x the number of fans on social media than in the stadium which is a huge number to account for behavior. Rooney being our most influential player tried to angle for a move to city in 2010 and then in 2013 had a rift with Ferguson and gave a transfer request with a view to transfer to Chelsea, he has been treated as nothing short of a god by the fans. Casillas is arguably more influential to Real Madrid than Rooney has been to us. We have much, much better fans than Real Madrid and that is a fact."
reddevils,3dccz8,JacksFieryVengeance,0,Wed Jul 15 08:50:40 2015 UTC,You can't compare those three to a Madrid legend. When was the last time United booed a club legend?

reddevils,3dccz8,ObstinatePoltergeist,17,Wed Jul 15 04:27:32 2015 UTC,It's funny that /r/soccer are saying this is a fuck you to Woodward and us.  I thought keeping him one last year was always the best case scenario aside from him signing a new contract?
reddevils,3dccz8,devilsway,10,Wed Jul 15 05:36:46 2015 UTC,Best case scenario is winning the title with DDG and him deciding to stay for the inevitable treble 2017.
reddevils,3dccz8,Zetch88,4,Wed Jul 15 11:03:05 2015 UTC,Cashing in on £30m instead of a free transfer I the second best case scenario. At least we wont lose any transfer money bringing someone else in then.
reddevils,3dccz8,scotty1987,16,Wed Jul 15 10:47:03 2015 UTC,My Understanding of this :   RM worried Man Utd could have a great season which will have an effect on DDGs already torn mind.   So they're adding in additional wager to make their case strong.
reddevils,3dccz8,spice3boy,8,Wed Jul 15 05:05:53 2015 UTC,"Even if what they are saying is true (which I don't think it is), wouldn't that be tapping up and highly illegal by Madrid? I thought legally, they really can't offer money to De Gea to wait out his contract unless he's in the last 6 months of his contract."

Now it isn't looking so sure and they've finally figured out that it's possible De Gea might actually stay at United this season. So to try and avoid people (mainly its readers) getting the idea that Madrid might not actually be able to sign who they want, whenever they please, they are now saying ""Ha! Real didn't even want him in the first place! This was their plan all along!"".  I doubt Madrid have made this offer to De Gea at all. Both clubs know that if he wants to leave, it isn't because of money."

reddevils,3d9vb3,CircleToShoot,9,Tue Jul 14 19:40:05 2015 UTC,"To be honest he was amazing for us during his first season under Sir Alex Ferguson, without any injuries. But it's kind of true that SAF signed the guy after having a great season for Arsenal and wanting to go out on a high, winning the title which van Persie was pretty much responsible for. I love and respect him for that, but during the past two seasons his form has faded, he's been riddled with injuries again and hasn't performed like he did during his best season for us. Sometimes it has looked like he doesn't even care what goes on on the pitch. I think Ferguson retiring was a really huge blow for him, which made him lose confidence and motivation.  Anyway I wish all the best for him at his new club and I hope he finds his quality form again. :) I should say that thank you for the 20th title for van Persie as well, although all of the top teams in the EPL performed like shite during that season, but he was one of the main reasons why we won the title."

Neither Arsenal nor Utd fans are on some morally superior level to the other set of fans, anyone who believes that is delusional. And that's most fans to be honest, regardless of club.   Fans are upset when players leave on bad terms regardless of the club. Utd are lucky to have been successful enough to not have experienced that much in recent years.   But just look at how Utd fans became upset with the idea of De Gea leaving for Madrid after you stood by him whilst he wasn't that good. Can you not see a paralel to some degree between that and the RVP situation? I don't think Utd fans are pathetic for being upset with De Gea and I don't think Arsenal fans are pathetic for being upset with RVP."

If Rooney left to go to Liverpool and then came out with such a belittling letter to us fans to only turn around and join them because the little boy inside of him always wanted to. We would crucify him, absolutely no questions.  He was Arsenal's captain, Mr. Wenger stood by him through a spade of injuries and behavioural issues. After he finally comes good he decides to use the fans to make his position untenable with the club, and for what? For a 250k contract with Manchester United.   He was a mercenary, the two parties used each other, he got a fat pay check and this club got number 20. Let's not forget how uneasy we all felt deep down about the situation initially, how weird it all looked. These romantic goodbye messages are either posted by fans who've only been here for 2/3 seasons or by fans who have only short term memories. We won't remember him honestly on the bigger picture of things in 10-20 years time but if he stayed at Arsenal, he could have been a club legend.

Anyway, I am both surprised that he was taken and excited for him. Hopefully he can get a full match in terms of minutes in while on tour.   Agree about that. If the last pre season showed anything, it is that those of us following the youth team with a passion have no fucking clue about what goes into LvG's decisions when picking the youth players for it. I still can not believe Pearson/Rothwell/Tuanzebe/Cameron BWJ weren't taken for it. Especially considering Di Maria and Rojo have extended leave, and I'll be honest that I am kind of bitter about it. It is what I love the most about the pre season. Just following the team and training with them would be a massive boost. I hope it means that Pearson/Rothwell have big loan deals lined up and are going on pre season with the respective teams... Who knows though? Blackett was promoted, Thorpe and Keane sent packing. So I don't know."
reddevils,3dbn7a,omegaxLoL,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:52:39 2015 UTC,Re: Pearson/Rothwell  Those are the two that need good loans the most out of the u21s. Because they are kind of the old guard in that set up now. Similar to what Thorpe has been the last two seasons.

reddevils,3dbamn,obadetona,72,Wed Jul 15 00:35:57 2015 UTC,"Robin Van Persie (Official):   RvP has officially completed his move to Fenerbahce, for a fee of £4.8m (€6.8m). [Sky Sports, BBC] On his move away from Old Trafford, RvP said: ""It was a situation where I could see it coming, if I'm really honest. I could get used to the idea for quite a bit. It was not a situation where it was just happening from day to day so I could get used to the situation – that is football. From my side, there are no hard feelings with how it went. It's part of football, it's part of life. I had a good moment with the players the day before I came to Istanbul so that was special. Then you see that everyone really appreciated my time there - that was important for me.""  On Ed Woodward, he said: “I highly appreciate the work of Ed Woodward, the CEO of Manchester United. The way he dealt with this transfer is from a high level, it's very classy. He proved he's a true gentleman in the way he dealt with the whole situation. Ed, if you're listening, thank you.""     Sergio Ramos:   Ramos is still intent on leaving. It is not a matter of money, but of respect. His relationship with Real Madrid president Florentino Pérez has hit a wall. The fact that Ramos has taken up the position of captain has made him change his stance. However, Madrid will not sell him and they refuse to lose two captains in one transfer window. [Marca] The situation with Ramos has not changed. He still believes that he should be the second highest earner at Real Madrid. Differences between himself and Florentino Pérez have not been reconciled, and the picture of them hugging does not mean anything. [Cadena COPE] The departure of Sergio Ramos is entirely dependent on De Gea moving to Real Madrid. [Cadena COPE]     David De Gea:   Van Gaal took De Gea on the US tour in order to put pressure on Real Madrid to increase their offer. [Marca] De Gea is unhappy with the way Jorge Mendes has handled the situation. [El Confidencial]     Robert Lewandowski:  Lewandowski’s agent, Cezary Kucharski, when asked about his client moving away from Bayern Munich:    “I think it would have to be a very high offer, definitely higher than €50m. Robert is one of the most valued strikers on the market who guarantees goals, guarantees assists, excitement. He has shown that over many years during his career. Every year he is an even better player and plays at a higher level and that is very important for other clubs because he has credibility and guarantees at least 30 goals a season. With a player of Robert's class, the truth is that not a lot of work is required because really there are only two directions in which he could go in the future, England or Spain, and only with Bayern Munich's acceptance.”     Victor Valdes:   Valdes was simply not selected for the US squad by Van Gaal. [Mark Ogden, Jamie Jackson] Valdes could transfer back to Spain this summer, with Valencia and Real Madrid possible destinations. [Sport] Amid speculation over his future, Valdes tweeted out: After a Hard Training Session this morning, i am working hard for this Season ! Come on You Reds !!!! [@1victorvaldes]     Angel Di Maria:   Di Maria will move to PSG this summer, for a fee of around £42.3m (€60m). He has already agreed terms with PSG. [Le Parisien] If Di Maria transfers to PSG, Van Gaal requests that a PSG player comes to United, preferably Cavani or Van der Wiel. [Goal France] PSG are encountering a problem with the Di Maria transfer, as he wants €260k/week wages instead of the €180k/week PSG are offering him. [France Football]     Nicolas Otamendi:   Otamendi is still most likely to join Manchester United. He is currently on vacation but scheduled to return to training on July 26th, however, he does not want to return to Valencia. [Marca] Manchester United are preparing an offer of £24.7m (€35m). Valencia will eventually lower their asking price as they do not want an unhappy player in the squad. [Marca]     Sergio Romero:   Manchester United and AS Roma are in talks for Sergio Romero. [Di Marzio] United are interested in bringing in Romero as a back-up goalkeeper, not as a starter. [Sky Italia]      Rafael Da Silva:   Rafael has been told by Van Gaal that he is not needed. His agent said: “His contract expires in June 2016 and the coach, Van Gaal, said he isn’t counting on him, so the player wants to leave and we are talking with more than one club about this.” Roma and Florentino were mentioned as clubs he would like to move to by his agent.

reddevils,3dbamn,beckham_7,10,Tue Jul 14 23:11:04 2015 UTC,"Unlikely. Probably there to disincentivise De Gea signing another contract with Manchester United if we don't sell him this summer. It's very dangerous running down a contract as a professional athlete, because you leave yourself up shit creek without a paddle if you sustain a serious injury in your last contract year. Offering a hefty sign-on fee enables Madrid to nab De Gea on the cheap (or for free) with a relatively nominal fee going directly to the player.  To be frank, De Gea staying for an additional year would not remotely be a win for us, and I highly doubt that we will choose that option. There's no way we are going to let a £20-odd million transfer fee get away from us when we already have a highly competent back up to replace him. As much as I appreciate De Gea as a world-class talent, it's very unlikely that one season's worth of performance is going to justify sacrificing that much money.  I also think people are underestimating the potential damage that would be caused by forcing De Gea to stay a year longer than he would ideally like. Athletes are attracted to clubs that don't hold their players hostage and are - in general - respectful to their career ambitions. Chelsea have demonstrated as much by allowing Mata to come to us and Cech to go to Arsenal - even if both moves went against the club's immediate interests. I think a club like Liverpool has potentially damaged its reputation amongst prospective signings based on the way they have so publicly castigated Raheem Sterling in the media.  All the noise in the media about how willing we are to let De Gea see out the remainder of his contract is likely a bluff designed to encourage Real Madrid to stump up a more significant offer. It's not a bad plan. You never know when Perez is going to get impatient and throw silly money at the vanity purchase of Spain's number one keeper.  Either way, I'm pretty certain that De Gea leaves this summer."
reddevils,3dbamn,Kambei1311,20,Tue Jul 14 23:38:22 2015 UTC,"I don't really agree. United need to win something next season. If we go a 3rd and 4th season without silverware, that's when we start to lose our power to fleece sponsors. It gets harder every year you miss out.  De Gea is our best player and would play a huge role in getting us a trophy. That's more valuable to United long term than missing out on the £15m Real have offered us.  I don't think keeping De Gea damages the club's reputation at all. He seems to be happy enough to play out his deal. He's not pulling a Sterling to get his move and the club haven't shamed him for turning down a mega deal. It all seems very amicable. No one is saying Real's reputation is hurt by keeping Ramos.  He'll probably end up going but keeping him another year, winning a trophy, and getting a proper replacement lined up isn't a bad deal - should it work out that way."
reddevils,3dbamn,yiyiyiyi,8,Wed Jul 15 00:10:52 2015 UTC,"If we go a 3rd and 4th season without silverware, that's when we start to lose our power to fleece sponsors. It gets harder every year you miss out.   We have the largest international fanbase in the world by some distance, and providing we get into the Champions League, we'll have the appropriate TV coverage to justify our sponsorship deals.  We are going to be absolutely fine financially even if we win nothing in the next five seasons. As long as we stay in the Champions League spots.   De Gea is our best player and would play a huge role in getting us a trophy.   Yes he's our best player, but he's also a player who is operating at one of the least important position groups.  We also have to come to terms with the fact that De Gea likely sees at least some form of regression next season. During the first half of last season his save rate was 76% - a completely unsustainable level - that tapered off later on.  With greater midfield and defensive stability next season, and with a very competent back-up keeper, it's very unlikely that De Gea elevates the level of the squad to the point where we can justify forgoing on a £20-odd million pound transfer fee. That money would be better off reinvested elsewhere in a more sustainable solution.   He's not pulling a Sterling to get his move   His contract situation means that he doesn't have to agitate for a move in the same manner that Sterling did.   and the club haven't shamed him for turning down a mega deal.   Likely because the club is sensible enough to behave professionally and retain a sense of integrity that will be attractive to prospective signings.   No one is saying Real's reputation is hurt by keeping Ramos.   Yet. Most people believe that Ramos isn't genuinely interested in a move to Manchester United and is likely pushing for a better contract.   keeping him another year, winning a trophy   Keeping De Gea for another year doesn't guarantee a trophy. It might very mildly increase our chances, but that change of probability is so low that the club will probably choose to cash in while he still has at least some value."
reddevils,3dbamn,Kambei1311,3,Wed Jul 15 00:25:05 2015 UTC,a highly competent back up to replace him   Are you talking about Valdes? Leaving him in Manchester seems to show LVG isn't interested in having him start.

reddevils,3dbamn,absoluteolly,1 point,Wed Jul 15 07:53:57 2015 UTC,"£20-odd million sounds like a lot of money until you realize we are making an extra £75-odd million from the Adidas deal, we'll have increased revenues from CL games, plus a metric fuckton of extra money from the new Sky and BT broadcasting deals. Also we've offloaded a number of players on high wages so we absolutely can sacrifice that kind of money especially if Madrid won't offer us what he's worth. Sports teams are not like other kinds of businesses. Their primary objective is not short term profit. The objective is to win. The owners of these clubs are already multi-billionaires rich from other ventures. They'll spend £20-odd million on a villa in Italy and visit once before selling it. The reason Financial Fair Play rules now exist is because so many owners were willing to throw money at the club for success and operate at a loss. Now the Glazers are probably not these kinds of owners but because of the way they acquired the club, they've made 10x off their investment already by forcing the club to pay back the debt they took on to acquire the club. Now they just need the success on the pitch to bring the value of the club up and they can cash out for a couple billion in profits. If De Gea is the difference between a CL round of 16 exit and us getting back to the Semi-final, we'll make back most of that loss anyways. If having De Gea gives us a legitimate shot at the PL title, even just for 1 season, then we should keep him. We only make money because we have fans. We have fans because we are successful. Before Abramovic started dumping money into Chelsea you'd probably never see a Chelsea kit outside of London. Now you'll see them anywhere from Belgrade, to Texas, to fucking Tibet. I saw a PSG kit in the airport the other day on some fucker who's probably never been to France. You never would have seen that pre-oil money. Nobody knows how De Gea feels about staying outside of him, his family, United, and his agent. Maybe he doesn't mind staying an extra year if he knows he'll land at Madrid anyways. It's quite an assumption to say the club is holding him hostage. He's not a hostage. He's a professional. He has a legally binding contract to play for us next season. With Mata, and Cech it made sense because they weren't being selected and were too good to be on the bench (we also spent a ridiculous amount to buy Mata). I think everyone feels Sterling and his agent were the ones in the wrong on that deal. Liverpool came out looking like geniuses, getting rid of an overrated player with those kinds of attitude problems for £50 million.   Bottom line: we have no need to sell De Gea. He hasn't outright said he wants out, it's all speculation based on the fact he hasn't renewed his contract. He may be fine with another year in Manchester for all we know and is just holding out to see how Madrid handles it's business this summer and whether Benitez will take the club forwards or backwards. They are coming off a trophy-less season after all, in which club legends and star players were booed and had their cars assaulted by fans.   Basically, unless De Gea is in Woody's office with tear-filled eyes, begging for a transfer, we should not sell De Gea unless Perez throws silly money at us. We have more to gain from 1 season of De Gea, and showing Perez he can't just buy players like toys displayed in a shop window than we do from £20-odd million."
reddevils,3dbamn,GrapeBread,4,Wed Jul 15 18:40:03 2015 UTC,To me I see no point in keeping a player that clearly wants to jump ship. I'd rather we tried to get €25-30m and reinvest in another long term keeper.

Even if they absolutely had to wait till next season, they'd be fixed at the goal-keeping position for the next 10 years.  That's just playing a hypothetical game though.

We've built a solid structure but I can't help think we're betting a huge amount on Depay in an attacking sense right now.  I also think a lot of people like Di Maria because he played well whenever they played us."

It's understandable - look, I grew up watching Manchester United. My father supported Manchester United. His father supported Manchester United. We're from the area.  For South American kids or Spanish kids their boyhood clubs will be based in La Liga and given that Real and Barca are two of the most successful chances are they will have grown up supporting one of them. Real Madrid are Ronaldo's boyhood club just like United is mine.

I know the first comments will be he is going to have a stellar season but the fact is his attitude and acts on and off the pitch weren't up to Manchester United or LvG's standards. He was dropped for a good portion at the end of last season and when he did come on, i famously remember this sub filled with comments such as ""Oh no not him again,"" and ""Who would have said they actually would prefer keeping Ashley Young on rather than ADM at the start of the season.""  Very rarely does a player not lose value after a bad season especially when you consider the initial fee was overinflated. With the latest additions our team seems to be stacked in terms of our midfield. I don't see LvG starting him as a midfielder. Therefore the only logical position would be on the wings, where he was highly inconsistent last season. I agree his stats where amazing for the run of games he had but the general play was more fluent without him.  Considering the recent theme of Mr. Woodward's astute business dealings, why wouldn't we sell a partially inconsistent player and recoup a majority of the highest transfer fee ever paid for a player in the EPL? We have literally had a ""clean house"" kind of summer which has been overshadowed by some great well timed transfers."

I think it's hard for players coming back from injury under LVG because he doesn't just thrust them immediately back into the first team. Di Maria looked like he was simply trying too hard after he came back, attempting to take on multiple players off the dribble, shooting wild long shots over the bar. It felt like he thought he needed to make up for the time lost while injured by scoring a bunch of world beating goals.  When all his high risk action didn't pay off, the pressure increased and his form dropped even more. We need to see what some time off and another season does for him. If he can settle down, learn the system, and find his form he will be one of our 3 best players."

A cushy lifestyle is the goal.  Look at Ronaldo. He has scored 300+ goals in La Liga as opposed to the 100 or so he scored in the Premier League. Why did he leave the best league in the world to be skipping around schoolboys in Spain?   Di Maria has no affinity towards United. Never has, never will. We are not his club.

reddevils,3dbamn,GrapeBread,2,Wed Jul 15 19:30:26 2015 UTC,Could just be made up.  I won't put any stock in it unless we pick up a winger.  That's when I'll start to worry.

reddevils,3dbamn,Crants,3,Wed Jul 15 01:06:30 2015 UTC,Memphis has world class potential.  I don't see the board or Woody letting Di Maria off the hook without first securing a currently world-class talent to replace him.  Not during Van Gaal's overhaul.

reddevils,3dbamn,ohyou123,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:28:32 2015 UTC,Any thoughts at striker? Lots of rumors of Chicarito being sold. If he leaves we absolutely need a striker. Lewandowski would be phenomenal but I don't buy those rumors for a second. Who could be a possible target?
reddevils,3dbamn,Savage9645,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:28:19 2015 UTC,"The problem there is I can't think of a single striker we could reasonably acquire that would make sense for us.

Club can accept a massive bid, 50m+ from PSG, and recoup almost all their fee. Or we can keep him, and hope he plays as well as he does for ARG. Either way, his transfer fee will be considerably lower next summer."

I honestly don't understand how people can want rid of him after one bad season. I love the strange attitude on here, everyone talking shit on RM for wanting DDG and just buying big names in and showing no loyalty etc, then wanting AdM out for one bad season.   I'll be gutted if he leaves honestly, he was one of the few interesting players last year, trying to do something with the ball instead of just pissing about with it and playing safe passes the entire season."
reddevils,3dbamn,GarethGore,2,Wed Jul 15 15:34:38 2015 UTC,I don't disagree with your last paragraph but it's just so frustrating to watch him run into his man and lose the ball. Reminded me of an out of form nani too.   I think he's a great player if we played more counter attacking...

reddevils,3dbamn,GarethGore,2,Wed Jul 15 16:17:30 2015 UTC,"Solidly. Tracked back well and made some tackles, covered his lb expertly. Going forward consistently beat his man, cut onto his right and got dangerous balls in.  I get where this is going though...

reddevils,3dbd3v,omegaxLoL,19,Wed Jul 15 00:35:12 2015 UTC,"Rojo is a decent center half, but he still makes glaring positional or tackling errors sometimes.

reddevils,3dbd3v,oolalaa,7,Wed Jul 15 03:01:27 2015 UTC,"I would start Smalling RCB (Over Rojo based on current Form) and Otamendi/Ramos LCB, but I think in the first half of the season Rojo was our best CB.

reddevils,3dbd3v,omegaxLoL,-2,Wed Jul 15 00:36:02 2015 UTC,"Well apart from the fact Rojo is better than Smalling, Otamendi is rightfooted and has played rightback in the past. So if hed come he probably will be our Right CB which means Smalling will not be chosen instead of Rojo but he is competing against Otamendi . So unless you telling me smalling is a better player than Otamendi it makes little sense. For the Left CB position Smalling is not better than Rojo and less well equipped being rightfooted. Btw just for the record I am actually not against Smalling i think he showed great promise in the last part of the season."

reddevils,3dbd3v,illyria_ShrmpDmnsn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:56:51 2015 UTC,Arguably the most technically gifted player in the team
reddevils,3dbd3v,Seanige,43,Wed Jul 15 12:35:20 2015 UTC,Daley Blind.
reddevils,3dbd3v,craptionbot,5,Wed Jul 15 00:28:23 2015 UTC,Thought he had an excellent first season with us. People forget that players usually take a few years until their mid-late twenties to dominate the anchor role in midfield for top teams.
reddevils,3dbd3v,rdzzl,2,Wed Jul 15 05:52:39 2015 UTC,What I find strange is the criticism he gets. Unlike Carrick he always looks ahead of him and is mobile enough to make runs if he can't see gaps. Isn't afraid to lump a shot in from outside a crowded box either.
reddevils,3dbd3v,Seanige,0,Wed Jul 15 08:07:22 2015 UTC,Lol what? He is far too average to start in my opinion. Passes it sideways and backwards and he gets overrun in midfield so easily.
reddevils,3dbd3v,mink551,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:29:09 2015 UTC,You're describing Carrick. Do you even watch Utd?
reddevils,3dbd3v,Seanige,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:48:29 2015 UTC,Carrick passes forward far more than Blind does. It's coincidence that we went on those unbeaten runs in between November-December and March-April once Carrick was fit.
reddevils,3dbd3v,mink551,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:54:45 2015 UTC,"What has unbeaten runs got to do with passing direction? If you look at the stats, you'll actually see that Carrick passes backwards a hell of a lot more than Blind. From a qualitative perspective, he usually passes back into dangerous positions and causes problems for us."
reddevils,3dbd3v,Seanige,0,Wed Jul 15 13:04:06 2015 UTC,"Oh nevermind then. Read it wrong, thought we were comparing them as players. As for Carrick, he does pass sideways and backwards but does quite often set key passes too."
reddevils,3dbd3v,mink551,3,Wed Jul 15 15:42:36 2015 UTC,"Daley Blind has gelled so well with this team this season - he reminds me of the Carrick from 4 odd years ago. I.e played a crucial role behind the scenes, with very important passes and positioning, but was nonetheless not really noticed.   That's not necessarily a bad thing - in these sorts of positions if you're not being noticed, you're probably doing your job right. Nevertheless, some more recognition for Blind's utility is definitely in order. I really don't think we should simply consign him to the role of permanent squad player given our new midfield; he's definitely got the quality to be in our starting XI."
reddevils,3dbd3v,Benallica,3,Wed Jul 15 17:01:46 2015 UTC,He had one game where he made a few mistakes and this majority of this sub went from calling him the next Carrick to saying he isn't good enough and will never be anything more than a squad player.
reddevils,3dbd3v,illyria_ShrmpDmnsn,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:42:05 2015 UTC,"Meh, I've always thought he'd be nothing more than a squad player. Still do. Helluva player to have for depth though."
reddevils,3dbd3v,FURyannnn,47,Wed Jul 15 10:55:08 2015 UTC,"There isn't anyone in the squad who is really underrated. But Phil Jones is someone who has his contributions overlooked more often than not. As far as I know, there is at least some consensus regarding every player's strengths and weaknesses. Phil Jones is one guy who incites widely differing opinions. I for one think he still has the potential to be a really good, possibly world class center back. Many people just slag him off and circlejerk about him getting injured by rushing into tackles, which honestly, hasn't happened all that often."
reddevils,3dbd3v,Xanian123,18,Wed Jul 15 13:28:39 2015 UTC,I agree with Phil Jones as the choice. I still feel he can be world class.
reddevils,3dbd3v,Scarred_Shadow,5,Tue Jul 14 23:27:56 2015 UTC,Defenders usually seem like they can come out of nowhere with world class ability. Smalling 2014 is literally a different player to Smalling 2015 for example.   My issue with Jones is how ability wise he's stagnated. He hasn't really grown since his first season and despite being a starting defender for anyone out of the top four I still feel he could be playing at a higher level right now. Time will tell what will happen to him though.
reddevils,3dbd3v,TheJoshider10,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:52:57 2015 UTC,Plenty of time. feels like he's been playing since 2008. He's only 23. He needs to be consistent and i guess try maintain those injuries.
reddevils,3dbd3v,TY1901,4,Wed Jul 15 00:43:53 2015 UTC,"I see people on this subreddit saying Stones is better than Jones, those people have never seen Stones play more than 2-3 times.  For his age, and the country he plays for, Jones' potential is great, but because he's English there's this overhype tag that makes people overlook him.   I can give you a bunch of vids that show why he's potential for world class and nobody will change their opinion of him."
reddevils,3dbd3v,ThatStiffyAce,8,Wed Jul 15 10:22:24 2015 UTC,Can't agree more on the Stones point. stones has proved very little. I think people look at his technique and say he's good but he had a mixed season last year and was a mess in his one euro u21 game. Phil Jones has had a mixed time at United but he's still had since fantastic games and at the highest level. He's miles ahead of stones.
reddevils,3dbd3v,ChickenSun,2,Tue Jul 14 23:58:26 2015 UTC,"I believe he had a great time at United and out of be 3-4 years we only had about 2 handfuls of mistakes from him and less that caused goals.   We just wanted to see the talent of a 28 yr old defender in a 22/23 yr old, we should stop thinking that pipe dream and be patient for Christ sakes."
reddevils,3dbd3v,ThatStiffyAce,2,Wed Jul 15 00:33:21 2015 UTC,"Stones is also English, I don't see your point with that one?  I could create a video to make Voronin look world class."
reddevils,3dbd3v,arron77,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"That's not remotely my point, just means they're in the same category, but if you want to keep the context, we hype one English man over another, just because he's tooted the next big thing by other fans.  When in fact, Jones is way more proven and there is more evidence to show that."
reddevils,3dbd3v,ThatStiffyAce,3,Wed Jul 15 04:59:16 2015 UTC,"In his last 6 home games he literally gave the ball away as the last man in every single match, each ending with a 1 on 1 with de gea, where he usually saved his bacon.  I'm sorry but the rushing into tackles is a minor concern. He can't keep his head. He has no poise currently and it's a glaring omission from his game. I have hope for him but the circlejerk isn't exclusively based upon his recklessness."
reddevils,3dbd3v,lordmaximus92,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:52:35 2015 UTC,"He does give away the ball on occasion and has to improve on that, undoubtedly. Poise is something of a stylistic preference IMO. Not all world class CB's are known for their poise."
reddevils,3dbd3v,Xanian123,3,Wed Jul 15 01:53:02 2015 UTC,"On occasion? It's pretty regular and if we were pushing for the title (with a lesser keeper) it could have been catastrophic.  I agree that not all top CBs are known for their poise, but all at least have an element of it. I personally believe Phil will never be considered anything other than a good CB but I really hope he can pull it together and take his game up a few levels because he undoubtedly has the frame, stature and a few other characteristics to be top quality. I just question his brain, but if anyone can put that right, it's LVG."

reddevils,3dbd3v,lordmaximus92,0,Wed Jul 15 12:32:53 2015 UTC,"How is it on me when you're the one who made the ridiculous claim? would you be drawn to proving any ridiculous statement wrong? if yes then prove Smalling didn't shoot 3 shots at his own goal in one away game, or that Blind didn't pass 3 times to Rooney by bouncing it off Carrick's ass.  I did watch it that's why am calling you a liar, i only remember 2 not 6, and one of them wasn't a 1v1.  Phil Jones is a solid player for his age, last term he had the highest interception rate in the team, yet people jump on the chance to make shit up about him to they're liking, it's stupid how many people here are oblivious to how useful he is."

reddevils,3dbd3v,lordmaximus92,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:04:31 2015 UTC,He's got a lot of potential but every time he starts to get into form he picks up an injury.
reddevils,3dbd3v,illyria_ShrmpDmnsn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:43:05 2015 UTC,No doubting his ability but he is very clumsy
reddevils,3dbd3v,Seanige,-1,Wed Jul 15 10:57:49 2015 UTC,Jones for me too too  Carrick and and smalling ooverrated
reddevils,3dbd3v,Panda12341234,2,Wed Jul 15 12:26:48 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say overrated. It is just that everyone does recognise the contribution they make to the team.
reddevils,3dbd3v,Xanian123,98,Wed Jul 15 00:53:50 2015 UTC,"Valencia maybe? He's always given his best on the pitch, been reliable and ran his heart out. Yes he's made some positional errors, but he's a winger being played in a position he's not familiar with. He's done commendably well. He may not be of the necessary quality at right back when we go challenging for the title and a run in the Champions League but he's without doubt a versatile and very important player for us. I've seen him get way too much stick towards last season from some, so maybe him."
reddevils,3dbd3v,ballsywallsy,12,Wed Jul 15 01:03:25 2015 UTC,"I think the problem with Valencia is that he's neither good enough defensively to be a first choice RB, nor good enough attacking to play further forward, especially at RW in a 433. Think he also gets a lot of hate for seemingly always having to stop on the ball and stand up his man for 2 seconds before doing anything with it. Can get very frustrating."
reddevils,3dbd3v,_Placeholder_,26,Tue Jul 14 23:28:11 2015 UTC,Definitely. Some of the stick he gets is way over the top.
reddevils,3dbd3v,evolution909,3,Wed Jul 15 01:15:01 2015 UTC,My issue with him is that I just don't think he's good enough for the squad end of. He's done a good job for someone who's been told to play as a full back despite not being a natural there but really I don't see a place for him in attack or defence.   I want to see him in CM again. Gave a good performance against Everton there.
reddevils,3dbd3v,TheJoshider10,14,Tue Jul 14 23:31:02 2015 UTC,We've got serious injury problems if Valencia ever starts for us at CM this year.
reddevils,3dbd3v,In_Liberty,-1,Wed Jul 15 00:45:27 2015 UTC,It'll happen. We'll get both Sch's injured with a Carrick needed a rest so we'll play Tony V or Rooney in midfield. It's just our luck despite filling out the midfield finally.
reddevils,3dbd3v,TheJoshider10,2,Wed Jul 15 01:51:51 2015 UTC,"I like him as a central mid rotation player. I forget which game it was last season, but he excelled in the role and has always been the lynchpin for Ecuador doing so as well. He's got good engine and ability, just can't take players on like he used to and shouldn't be the one you're relying on in a last defender situation."
reddevils,3dbd3v,Scarred_Shadow,4,Wed Jul 15 10:55:19 2015 UTC,Everton.
reddevils,3dbd3v,wharsmetoothpicson,2,Tue Jul 14 23:46:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's reached the same level he was at before he broke his leg but I agree, I think he's underrated by most fans. Apart from the fact he's not a natural right back I think he hasn't been helped by the fact that we've had to play left footers ahead of him who like to come inside, as opposed to Blind/Rojo/Shaw on the left who've been able to strike up useful combinations with Young."
reddevils,3dbd3v,fredum,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:53:10 2015 UTC,"He was player of the year the season after he broke his leg. He may have declined since, but it's not due to the injury. Agree that he's underrated though, he had a better season than he was given credit for in my opinion"
reddevils,3dbd3v,LebRonWeasely,3,Wed Jul 15 01:34:27 2015 UTC,I'd agree if he was even semi reliable in the final third
reddevils,3dbd3v,danskzwag,3,Wed Jul 15 07:13:41 2015 UTC,"It's funny, but his confidence went sky high after he got that dubious January player of the month award and as a result he started offering some decent stuff going forward. But prior to that he was absolutely shocking and the primary focus of my ire."
reddevils,3dbd3v,KhwarazmianShah,-14,Wed Jul 15 00:00:15 2015 UTC,"lol you're crediting a fullback for running, he is a bad right back and a even worse winger simple as."
reddevils,3dbd3v,StannisJr,38,Wed Jul 15 01:11:05 2015 UTC,I think Januzaj has been written off by a ton people
reddevils,3dbd3v,TheWrathofKrieger,19,Tue Jul 14 23:43:32 2015 UTC,I'm really hoping we can see better from him this season. If he truly develops then Depay/Januzaj as the future of our flanks isn't bad at all.
reddevils,3dbd3v,PacifisticJ,5,Tue Jul 14 23:27:57 2015 UTC,It would be a duplicate of Robbery.  Januzaj is very much like Robben even if he isn't as explosive.
reddevils,3dbd3v,GrapeBread,7,Tue Jul 14 23:32:45 2015 UTC,"He's got really good vision, dribbling, passing and his technique when it comes to shooting is pretty damn good. He's got everything you need for a world-class winger. Really promising lad; I have no doubt he'll deliver. If he leaves, he'll most definitely do a Pogba."
reddevils,3dbd3v,Polar_Bear_Cuddles,5,Wed Jul 15 02:02:45 2015 UTC,He just needs to keep his head up and get better at deciding when to dribble vs when to pass.   I think he and Di Maria are the best dribblers in the squad and that hurt them in this system. Rather than keep the ball moving and patiently unlocking the defense they would try and take on 3 or 4 players and quickly lose posession.  I get that there is a lot or pressure for both players as they each took a step back last season but part of the reason they struggled was because they tried to do too much. Januzaj's fancy dribbles and Di Maria's wild long shots weren't coming off.
reddevils,3dbd3v,PacifisticJ,2,Wed Jul 15 03:30:04 2015 UTC,"Also Januzaj has already mastered ""acting"" like Robben :p"
reddevils,3dbd3v,nickooj,7,Wed Jul 15 06:35:29 2015 UTC,"He was, admittedly, a bit crap in what few appearances he had last season, but I think that was more down to overeagerness than anything else. Reckon a loan spell this season would do a world of good, but it's a risky move morale-wise considering the initial hype (and agent machinations). Couldn't be anything less than a loan to a side in and around Europa League places, imo."
reddevils,3dbd3v,G_Morgan,5,Wed Jul 15 06:29:06 2015 UTC,I'd rather he spend a year with this United squad so he develops and learns from and with United.
reddevils,3dbd3v,nickooj,3,Tue Jul 14 23:36:01 2015 UTC,"I also think a lot of people raised him up too high in that Moyes season. This past season he really disappointed me. Not that I want to see him leave or anything, but there's little chance he's get any starting opportunity even if Di Maria leave. I'd want him to go out on loan, get a good season under his belt and prove that he's the future that we want him to be."
reddevils,3dbd3v,illyria_ShrmpDmnsn,2,Wed Jul 15 03:26:33 2015 UTC,Januzaj's problems are all in his head. Unfortunately it is easier to teach a man skills than it is to teach them a personality. Maybe he'll sort it out but I'd have expected to see some progress by now.

reddevils,3dbd3v,nickooj,11,Wed Jul 15 11:04:57 2015 UTC,Not sure how much flak I'm going to get for this but Rooney. I've always felt the intangibles he brings to the game add that much more to his worth as a player.
reddevils,3dbd3v,Irishane,3,Tue Jul 14 23:52:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's the most under-appreciated player, for both club and country."
reddevils,3dbd3v,nickooj,0,Wed Jul 15 03:11:57 2015 UTC,"For country I do think he's a little over-hyped at times. Everyone always expects him to do a lot because he's THE Rooney. For club though, I think people can't wait to replace him.."
reddevils,3dbd3v,Illum503,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:06:12 2015 UTC,"I think for country he's under-appreciated because if the hype. English fans don't seem to be able to acknowledge how much he's done for you or the fact that he'll be your record goal-scorer for a long time to come or that he's the player teams fear so they double up on him.   From the outside looking in, England fans are the Real Madrid of national support. You don't know how lucky you are to have him."

reddevils,3dbd3v,Illum503,16,Wed Jul 15 13:57:26 2015 UTC,Rafael.  If we sold everyone who had an injury-hit season (not that that's the real reason he wasn't playing) we wouldn't have anyone.
reddevils,3dbd3v,shades3370,2,Wed Jul 15 14:02:43 2015 UTC,"I think most of us here really like Rafael and wish he would get another chance, it just seems like LVG really doesnt rate him"
reddevils,3dbd3v,Polar_Bear_Cuddles,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:07:04 2015 UTC,"And everyone just seems to change their view of him rather than question LvG.  You'll see it with Di Maria too, if LvG decides to sell him it'll go from ""I hope he doesn't get sold, he didn't really flop"" to ""oh well, he never performed here"" overnight"
reddevils,3dbd3v,Illum503,2,Wed Jul 15 06:25:01 2015 UTC,"dont think you can really generalize like that, people who really follow united know whats up. The truth is if LVG doesnt rate him or doesnt seem him as part of the team then hes out, im a huge rafael guy, i remember his fuckups; the munich game a few years back, the leicester game, but he plays hard for the badge and he really cares about the team. Its too bad that he couldnt cut it but thats life. This is a new era for united, we seem to be cutting guys loose a year too early rather than letting them hang around for too long. We're going to lose some favorites but i think it will be good for the club in the long term"

reddevils,3dbd3v,Prendy,3,Wed Jul 15 06:30:14 2015 UTC,"Chicharito. One bad season, under Moyes, and suddenly he was never United quality. He is a great poacher when confident."
reddevils,3dbd3v,linkolphd,3,Wed Jul 15 06:38:22 2015 UTC,"Agree with this one. When RvP scored 30 goals in 12-13, Chicharito scored 18 in 36 games, many of them coming from the bench.. Better goals/game ratio than his first season. But because RvP was so good that season, Chich's performance probably got overlooked. I think he is a great poacher and needs good midfielders feeding him, which we will have now. I hope he comes back to form."
reddevils,3dbd3v,fash5fc,2,Wed Jul 15 09:37:38 2015 UTC,"Good poacher, however his touch is pretty dreadful at times, can't really play alone up front."
reddevils,3dbd3v,Clark-Kent,2,Wed Jul 15 12:11:59 2015 UTC,"We can't guarantee we'll play one set formation, he might be useful at times and always provides an option from the bench."
reddevils,3dbd3v,LedgeySC,12,Wed Jul 15 12:01:41 2015 UTC,Valencia   He isn't a natural fullback but he did a good job there despite the everton disaster and the welbeck goal .  He was one of if not the most hardworking player of the whole season.
reddevils,3dbd3v,Seanige,30,Wed Jul 15 12:18:31 2015 UTC,"Jonny Evans,boy gets way too much hate"
reddevils,3dbd3v,TheJoshider10,12,Tue Jul 14 23:31:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. His last season was absolute shite but the season before he was brilliant. He either struggles with confidence or is struggling with a change of system. Not necessarily against selling him but he's a great defender on his day."
reddevils,3dbd3v,rdzzl,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:41:17 2015 UTC,Makes too many mistakes. Valencia gets crucified on here for being out of position but Evans can misjudge the path of a ball and let a striker in on goal without a hint of criticism. Puzzles me.
reddevils,3dbd3v,SarcasticDevil,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:49:07 2015 UTC,"He was usually good when he had a leader beside him. This defence does not have any leaders. A Ramos - Evans partnership could actually be good, even if it would be laughed at for the fact it's Evans."
reddevils,3dbd3v,arron77,4,Wed Jul 15 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"He was usually good when he had a leader beside him.   He is also good whenever he gets a few games under his belt. Jonny has always been a slow starter. Kind of like Rooney. Needs 4-5 games to really get going on a consistent level. So playing two games then picking up an injury --> repeat, makes it impossible for him to perform. I personally hope we keep him and loan out Blackett."
reddevils,3dbd3v,ritwikjs,2,Wed Jul 15 00:47:02 2015 UTC,"He's the very definition of a confidence player. When his confidence is down he makes a higher than average number of mistakes, but given a good run he's had some very good periods of his career. He's certainly not a horrible defender but I don't think he works well as a fourth or fifth choice because lack of games seems to hurt him more than most"
reddevils,3dbd3v,ritwikjs,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:15:03 2015 UTC,It's just a circle jerk to criticise him.
reddevils,3dbd3v,Seanige,8,Wed Jul 15 10:36:35 2015 UTC,"Daley Blind.  Saved us more times than people realize, and played a plethora of positions to a respectable extent. Once he grows into the team and the english system, he will become a very very good player for us. If some of you remember our first game against West Brom last season, you would've seen one of the most complete midfield performances in Daley Blind, irrespective of the fact that we drew that game."
reddevils,3dbd3v,mexicanpetal,4,Wed Jul 15 05:01:47 2015 UTC,"exactly! and Blind rarely loses his head. Been dribbled past a handful of times, but he ALWAYS makes up for it. I remember during our good run of form at the close of last season, Blind overlapped very well with young, simply because he times his runs well. While Shaw is fast and agile, Blind in smart and calculating, and has a good cross, which he times well too"
reddevils,3dbd3v,raimis78,2,Wed Jul 15 05:49:52 2015 UTC,There are games where he is literally faultless and is completely ignored. Guess that's just the type of player he is.

reddevils,3dbd3v,Teabagz092,1 point,Wed Jul 15 08:02:16 2015 UTC,I disagree. Looking at stats with and without him last season is enough to convince me of his impact.
reddevils,3dbd3v,Seanige,-1,Wed Jul 15 11:46:52 2015 UTC,"Stats also highlight his biggest weaknesses on an individual basis.   He doesn't take enough shots (less than one shot every two games) Doesn't get many assists or goals (3 total in 16 appearances, for a guy who can supposedly pick the right pass.) 1.4 tackles per game for a guy who plays positionally as a DM seems rather low. Runs are almost non existent Key passes (not just long balls) are also 0.4 per game.  Stats also show he loses the ball as often as he plays a key pass."
reddevils,3dbd3v,035036503530,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:44:34 2015 UTC,Everything you've listed I'd argue isnt even his job  He brings others into the game and dictates play. Hence the stats the matter i.e winning games  I do see where you're coming from though.
reddevils,3dbd3v,Indianize,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:27:59 2015 UTC,"W/L is obviously important but I feel he has lost some of the attributes that made him dominant and able to control the game. He lacks mobility and the ability to find cutting passes. Of course, with weaker options around him you can't expect him to play at the same level. This season he will be surrounded by stronger, more mobile players and hopefully thrive on it."
reddevils,3dbd3v,035036503530,4,Wed Jul 15 15:50:02 2015 UTC,In terms of this sub specifically then Rooney. I see him trashed in this sub daily.

reddevils,3dbd3v,Trickybuz93,4,Wed Jul 15 00:34:06 2015 UTC,"I'm always bothered by how quickly ppl toss Young and Fellaini aside, though I'm not sure I can say they underrate them. Realistically, an in form ADM should start over Young, idk about Memphis though, I don't think he should start over Young right away. Same for Fellaini, he should be plan B, but ppl take it too far saying that when he's on the pitch the team inevitably devolves into hoofball, at the very least it's not his fault (I for one don't think he's just a one dimensional player tho).  Anyways, among my friends Smalling has to be one of the most underrated players no doubt."
reddevils,3dbd3v,elongatedbollocksack,3,Wed Jul 15 02:24:26 2015 UTC,"Fellaini is pretty skillful, and people who think we are playing hoofball by havig him are talking nonense. Its not like hes a pacey player who will try to chase loose balls, or some sort of battering ram. We lacked some bite the season before last and he brought.  Anyway, i think the reason they get stick is that they really stick out physically, and at times thats what gives teams a hard time."

reddevils,3dbd3v,TheDrySkinOnYourKnee,3,Wed Jul 15 05:52:55 2015 UTC,"For me, I think it's probably Jesse Lingard. He's always had a bit of hype that seems to have died down a little lately, but the fact that LVG picked him for RB first game of last season (who knows where that would have gone if not for injury) and has brought him along on the tour again shows me the gaffer has a lot of faith in him. And it's well deserved too, always impresses on his loan spells and had a special goal against Sweden in the Euro u21s just a few weeks back."
reddevils,3dbd3v,hoochiscrazy_,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:26:23 2015 UTC,"At the moment I'd also go with Fellaini. I know he's gonna miss the beginning of the season with the red he got in the last game and that's a huge obstacle to overcome, but have we forgotten his great form for Belgium at the beginning of the summer? He had what like 5 goals in three games. I think he's got a big role to play this season especially if we don't pick up another striker."
reddevils,3dbd3v,GorillaPipe,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:58:55 2015 UTC,"Fellaini did EXCELLENTLY as a target man, and a physical presence.

I'd much rather have a more mediocre player like Valencia to serve as backup-RB for Darmian than one who we're lucky to have available for more than 20 games a season.   Might as well sell him and get at least some money for him now while he still has some value."

reddevils,3d8oqb,ninjapanda_,6,Tue Jul 14 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"Haha I appreciate the support. I've come to learn that downvotes are synonymous with disagreeing with an opinion on Reddit (despite what the rules say). Personally, I only upvote if I agree/like a comment and, if I don't agree/like something, I merely don't vote at all (excusing rare, extreme circumstances in which I find a downvote necessary).   But oh well! If anything, I suppose it's good to see that some people care a lot about one of our out-of-form players enough to dispute negative opinions of him. I'd much rather see that then the harassing of out-of-form players (like we've seen with Cleverley, Young, and Fellaini)."

I'd much rather see that then the harassing of out-of-form players (like we've seen with Cleverley, Young, and Fellaini).   Well said!   Regarding voting I think you're right, unfortunately. Downvotes makes more sense in strictly fact based subreddits, like /r/science where you'd want to avoid spreading incorrect/false information. This can hold true here as well, but in a subreddit like /r/reddevils a lot of the comments are based on opinion and perspective. ""I believe this because of that"" etc. Utilizing up/down-votes as an agree/disagree button does not lend the subreddit any service as a slight majority can suppress good counterarguments for a hot topic. As well as discourage people from going against the grain."
reddevils,3d8oqb,ninjapanda_,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:27:57 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Hell, I'm weird in that sense--I often actively search out the downvoted comments. I find it enlightening to talk to someone who has a vastly different opinion rather than just talking to the people who share the same thoughts as me.   Take these recent transfers for instance. As much as I enjoy joining in the jubilance in how good they are going to be for us, I'm interested in the negative -7 comment that says they don't think Darmian will be a good fit for our team. Why do they think that? Have they watched him play and have they developed reasonable hesitations that are worth considering?  Though more often than not, the downvoted comments (or at least the extremely so) are from people that, while having interesting contrarian views, present them like assholes."
reddevils,3d8oqb,shredderrrrrr,2,Tue Jul 14 21:37:14 2015 UTC,"Strictly speaking I believe the fault lies with the design of reddit's voting system and not our community. I think the way voting on comments is designed enforces, or at least encourage, confirmation bias to take place for any given majority. Except of course for people like you who actively seeks out the flip side."
reddevils,3d8oqb,ninjapanda_,3,Tue Jul 14 22:18:08 2015 UTC,"I agree, I used to love the guy when he was younger. But when you consider his progression he hasn't come very far, I always worry when he's on a yellow.   I still feel like we should give him maybe one more year, though, even if he's third choice. Anderson got about 6, and he didn't try half as hard as Rafa has."
reddevils,3d8oqb,DubSket,4,Tue Jul 14 18:03:46 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. I would be ok if he was kept around to see how it goes this season (especially considering how many games we'll likely have and how it might take Darmian some time to acclimate to the league).   I'd much rather we offload Johnny Evans. He's getting older, has proven he isn't the most reliable (despite the occasional good performance), and is in a position where we already have plenty of similar/better players (Smalling, Jones, Rojo, McNair, Blackett, and even Carrick or Blind if necessary)."
reddevils,3d8oqb,shredderrrrrr,2,Tue Jul 14 18:22:19 2015 UTC,Everything you say goes against the way our club treats our players and is why players like Solskjaer stayed through mountains of injury problems rather than being discarded.  I think you're supporting the wrong team.
reddevils,3d8oqb,mocthezuma,3,Tue Jul 14 16:38:26 2015 UTC,"It's not that I don't love the guy or don't wish him the best--I just don't think he is the right man for the job we are looking for (backup RB). If he stayed, I would be perfectly fine with that. I will stand behind any United player. So don't think I have any lack of appreciation for him. I'm not going to be flying any ""RAFAEL OUT"" banners. If he's wearing red, he has my loyalty.   My comment was just looking at it practically. If we want to be a top club, we can't just hold on to every player who has showed some good form. We need to be realistic and make prudent choices (even when they are emotionally hard). It's why we let Fletcher go. Was he still a decent player? Of course. But he wasn't what we needed. We needed a consistently top-class CM that could play week-in and week-out. Similarly, we need someone who can reliably fill a void at RB whenever Darmian needs a break or is hurt. A player with constant injuries (particularly one who picks them up outside of actual matches so frequently) is not a good candidate for such a position, regardless of who they are. It not that I've given up hope on Rafael or his abilities--it's that it is silly to have a back-up player who may or may not be healthy based on the flip of a coin.   And hell, part of my desire to let Rafael go is for his sake! He clearly is not wanted at United by LVG. Why then have him stay and waste away years of career? Why not have him go somewhere where he can truly work to live up to his early form?  TL;DR: It's not that I think we should ""give up"" on Rafael--it's that I don't think he is the right man for the job we need of him and we shouldn't let our love for the players cloud logical decisions."

reddevils,3d8oqb,AMAaboutA,4,Tue Jul 14 12:19:43 2015 UTC,Zero chance. Rafael isn't wanted. It's been clear since the Leicester game that Van Gaal doesn't rate Rafael.
reddevils,3d8oqb,WillyMorganOnTheWing,6,Tue Jul 14 13:57:04 2015 UTC,Oh shut up. Rafael played the very next game against West Ham at home and put in a man of the match performance.  He later got injured which is why he didn't play more.
reddevils,3d8oqb,mocthezuma,0,Tue Jul 14 16:36:06 2015 UTC,Oh shut up   How charming. There's a reason Valencia was selected instead of a fit Rafael. There's also a reason Van Gaal was critical of Rafael in public after the Leicester game. He was a marked man.
reddevils,3d8oqb,WillyMorganOnTheWing,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:16:22 2015 UTC,"Erm... Ok but, why does he need a different program considering he already played two games before the season ended and, also trained all the time with us. He's not injured now is he?  He's not unfit either clearly. He's also not unwell.   It's possible of course but I really can't see why he would be put on a different program and left back at carrington. Unless he's banned from entry because he somehow flashed Michelle Obama a few weeks ago."

reddevils,3d8oqb,ausnick2001,3,Tue Jul 14 12:15:53 2015 UTC,The bandage is likely a first layer so the white strapping tape doesn't tear his hair out from his hand. I've had those layers on for my legs at some points and then taped over that for some injuries or so last time. It's quite a common thing to have for some people who have a lot of hair or so to reduce the waxing effect or some allergies to the skin at times.   I wouldn't read too much into that extra layer. I also don't see the bruising you're talking about actually.

reddevils,3d8oqb,NedNoodles,14,Tue Jul 14 15:26:07 2015 UTC,Literally the only thing I can think of is that he is on a specialised programme to get him ready for the physicality of the Premier League for the impending departure of De Gea.

reddevils,3d8oqb,itsandercontrol,2,Tue Jul 14 11:38:46 2015 UTC,what would be more clever is if we went out and bought a better keeper to replace de gea.

reddevils,3d8oqb,GreenGuy20,11,Tue Jul 14 11:58:20 2015 UTC,I reckon hes got a small Injury or is suffering from a fitness problem. That is why he did not go on the tour. Making sure hes 100% is more important then playing a few games in the states.
reddevils,3d8oqb,Orcnick,6,Tue Jul 14 11:26:48 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this comment by saying I don't know what the thinking is behind whether there's a limit of players they can take on the tour and if so, I have no idea why there would be so if anyone knows more I'd love to be enlightened.  Anyway, on the assumption that there's a limited number of places available for LVG to take with him on the tour, would it make sense that the reason Valdes isn't there is because out of the four goalkeepers, the other three are going to get much more of a benefit from being there?  Valdes has worked with him before, and said when LVG was hired last year that he built the foundations for the successful Barcelona we've seen in the last decade so in terms of the philosophy he's the most ingrained in it of the 4, the other 3 will benefit the most.   In terms of playing time, LVG has already said he wants to give youth a chance so it makes sense he's taking the two youngsters. Again, getting them used to the philosophy which Valdes already has experience of and also giving them some game time in front of the big crowds which Valdes already has plenty of.  As for DDG, I can only hope he's there because it's been made clear he'll be here next year in which case, he's going to be first choice over Valdes so if there's one spot left for an experienced keeper then it makes sense it would be for DDG.  The time back in Manchester means he can be put on a special training programme as others have mentioned or focus on other things also such as coaching badges."

reddevils,3d8oqb,mexicanpetal,2,Tue Jul 14 11:57:25 2015 UTC,Maybe Valdes wasn't 100% fit? LvG already knows his qualities and this way he can recover at his own speed. It also gives a chance for Johnstone and Lindegaard to show their qualities for a potential sell/loan.

He's obviously not going to get any game time on the tour with an injury so may as well stay in Manchester and get fit for the start of the season.

Think Liverpool will be done once they get a striker, probably Benteke in which case I don't see them getting top 4."

reddevils,3d8gku,Tixicot,13,Tue Jul 14 12:41:41 2015 UTC,I think that depends what you call contending.  Personally I think Chelsea will win by 5-9 points.   like us   It's quite arrogant to just assume we're contenders and Arsenal won't be given they just finished above us by five points imo.  You can say we made signings but we made signings last season and almost all of them contributed very little. Signings aren't a guarantee of improvement.

reddevils,3d8gku,giblets24,25,Tue Jul 14 13:48:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's a lot to worry about in Liverpool's signings. They're all good and sensible signings but none of them are going to take Liverpool up a level and they won't be able to replace Sterling with the same quality. I think Benteke would be a great signing for them though. He's such a handful for defenders and he's a strong finisher.  Arsenal signing Cech is like us signing Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger. It's a game changer. They still really need a top class centre forward though.  Putting the money aside, Sterling is a fantastic signing for City. Sterling, Aguero and Silva up front is as good as anything in the league. They still need a midfielder and should probably be looking at a CB. I think City are going to be a force next season.  Chelsea didn't need much work but they've done good business. Not a lot to say really. I don't think Mourinho will revive Falcao but it won't matter too much if he doesn't."

reddevils,3d8gku,sethu2,13,Tue Jul 14 10:26:58 2015 UTC,"Liverpool fan here, can't sleep so i'm just searching for some soccer discussion. As of right now I'm assuming we're getting Benteke, although some lfc fans are hoping with the Sterling money we go after someone like Reus or Lacazette. Personally I'd be fine with Benteke, as he's strong, reasonably quick, and a good finisher. Plus he's very good with the ball at his feet for a guy his size. He's had a good scoring record with Aston Villa and I'm sure he can do even better when he's got Coutinho, Firmino, and Lallana feeding him balls rather than Joe Cole and Agbonlahor. There's a big if on Sturridge, but if he stays fit I think he's top 3-5 strikers in the league.  This coming season if everything comes together, and that's another if, I think Liverpool has a good chance of making top 4, or at least I think we're the strongest candidates outside City, Arsenal, you guys, and Chelsea. Southampton's losing a couple of their best players, and though I think they'll bounce back it's going to be tough again. Spurs have, on paper at least, strengthened their defense, but if Kane doesn't keep up his form next season I don't see them doing as well. Personally I think City look like the weakest out of the top 4. Sterling's a good purchase for them, though overpriced, but as of right now I don't see him winning games for them on his own. Everybody in their squads a year older next year, and they're going to be pretty reliant on Silva and Aguero keeping form/staying healthy. They finished second this year but apart from Chelsea nobody in the top 6 was consistently on form.  I'm really hoping Sturridge can stay healthy, because while he's no Suarez he's still a fantastic striker and could really make the difference for us between top 4 and top 6"
reddevils,3d8gku,giblets24,2,Tue Jul 14 12:58:59 2015 UTC,"Wow, commenting here must take some courage.   Anyways, if you really wanted a strong muscling striker, then I think you already have Balo to fill that position. I don't particularly think Benteke is cut out for the part that you are referring to.  I think you guys need a forward who can pull defenders aside, maybe 2, so that there is space from behind for Coutinho to strike or dribble into the box. I vaguely remember even Henderson dribbling in whilst Sterling pulled aside a defender.  So my thought was, you guys need a strong presence that can occupy one or two CBs. This requires him to have a rocket finish, so if unmarked, any ball would end up in the back of the net. Kinda like what Torres of the old would have done.  That's why am not sure how well Benteke is for that. Perhaps he could make that position his own."

If they do strengthen there with a decent backup for Giroud and someone to take over from Arteta/Flamini, it will be a tossup between United and City for 3rd and 4th strongest squads. It is a little disappointing, knowing that spending 150m in one summer and close to 80m pounds the next is not good enough to bring you near the top of the table in team quality and star power. I just hope we get a great striker to take over from/ rotate with Rooney."
reddevils,3d8gku,Xanian123,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:56:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think you guys need a world beater as Rooney's back up. Rooney's still a class striker and given some good game time up front he'll score goals. I just doubt you'll be able to attract someone like Lacazette with the promise of playing back up to Rooney, even if you offer them a good deal of money. Someone like Remy would probably be great for you. He knows how to score goals, he wouldn't be that expensive, and he can play on the wing, plus he offers something different from Rooney with his speed"
reddevils,3d8gku,mink_man,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:01:17 2015 UTC,"Rooney is my favorite player at United, but being brutally honest, I don't think he'll score as many goals as he did three years ago. He needs to reshape his game to be more effective as a 10 or a second striker. But LVG doesn't use that position, so it is sort of a strange situation for us up front. If Lacazette comes though, I would rotate both of them for a year based on a form and give him the main striker duties from next year."

I'm not sure about everyone else but I don't expect them to finish top 2 until Wenger pulls his finger out and buys some players.  City haven't impressed me so far and they still need 5 home-grown players to fill the 25 man squad so I don't expect much quality depth but I'm not going to write them off just yet as I do expect them to spend another £150m on top of Sterling. Not sure who they're going to buy though.  Liverpool are a team that has done good business and looks set to sign Benteke but tbh, I think they are still another season of spending away from top 4. They could have signed Messi but they're still being managed by Rodgers so...."

reddevils,3d8gku,sicaxav,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:11:50 2015 UTC,"don't think they will be top 2 if they don't make two more top quality additions.   This is how I always see Arsenal. For every top signing they make, their squad is then just riddled with lower quality elsewhere. You get a Sanchez and an Ozil but then there's just a bit of ""okay"" in between. Players that will make them challenge for top 4 but never push them for the title.  If there's one thing they needed more of, it was proven league winners. They now have 3 recent ones with Ozil, Sanchez and Cech, and that's something they needed just as much as overall quality. I'm still not really worried about them as a whole because I think they lack in areas and with our financial power it gives maybe a false sense of security that even if we fall below them, we will always be able to rise back up."
reddevils,3d8gku,StannisJr,3,Tue Jul 14 17:07:00 2015 UTC,"I read in the Arsenal sub that because Arteta signed an extension that most likely they wouldn't sign another DM. Now I'm not entirely sure the reasoning behind it is (probably because he's a good DM when fit?), but if that's the case we have 1 less problem on our hands"
reddevils,3d8gku,ReflectingGod,4,Tue Jul 14 12:35:40 2015 UTC,They still need 5 homegrown players? Wow... that is ridiculous. Now I'm interested in what players they'll get. I suppose they could just bring through some youngsters though.
reddevils,3d8gku,JuanRiquelme,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:23:17 2015 UTC,"I believe so. To my understanding you need 8/25 squad members to be home-grown (over 21, has been registered to English or Welsh FA from 18th to 21st birthday) and they so far have Hart, Clichy and one English squad player. Sterling will count as home-grown in December but not yet. I'm not sure what the consequences are if the home-grown rules aren't met though. I think their biggest problem is that they already have such a mediocre squad with a few exceptions. They have so much dead-weight and poor squad depth and they have to add more dead-weight  (crappy English players) to the team. Whats interesting to me is that they've so far only approached Delph so I'm wondering if the consequences aren't so bad."
reddevils,3d8gku,StannisJr,12,Tue Jul 14 10:44:12 2015 UTC,They can just leave a gap and register less players if they want too.   Under 21's don't need to be registered either so if they have 4-5 Under 21's plus 20 Registereds they'll still be okay.  Denayer and Sterling for example won't be registered but both will be a big part of their season.
reddevils,3d8gku,eggaldo,3,Tue Jul 14 11:01:53 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm actually happy that Delph turned them down now, not only for his game-time but also because of this problem they now find themselves in. Hilarious. I'm really interested to find out what English players they'll get, as now that Delph rejected them, they might start thinking to themselves; ""We'll be benched, I'd rather play football and have a decent career and do my job than just pick up a free pay cheque""."
reddevils,3d8gku,Derbinswithamustach,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:56:42 2015 UTC,I was thinking about this the other day and scarily enough Delph would be their 3rd best CM if he signed (Not as good as Yaya and Fernandinho but better than Fernando). I think he actually would have gotten game time depending on another CM signing and whether they opt for 433 over their 4222. For this reason I actually think City could potentially finish 4th depending on whether they land a world class CM in this transfer window.
reddevils,3d8gku,Polar_Bear_Cuddles,-1,Tue Jul 14 12:40:31 2015 UTC,What were they thinking selling Milner?

reddevils,3d8gku,StannisJr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:26:44 2015 UTC,They offered him £165K a week I heard. He was already on a ridicules wage but wanted to play CM.

reddevils,3d8gku,rdzzl,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:57:02 2015 UTC,"The issue with yaya is he needs to adapt his game to his age in the same way the likes of Scholes, Gerrard and Lampartd had to.  Sure he is a world class player but for me last year was the year where his identity came under threat. He cannot power his way through the midfield anymore, imo he has to go strictly dm or am and with that he would need a solid cm partner."

reddevils,3d8gku,DVio,4,Tue Jul 14 18:16:32 2015 UTC,"Unal Erm. So, Enes Unal is here everyone. 18 years old and Turkish are some of the things I can gather from Wikipedia. Everyone says he’s a promising youngster so we’ll see if he gets included in the City team. Like Nathan though, if anyone actually knows anything about him feel free to write it below.   My friend is Turkish and follows turkish players religiously. He has high hopes for Unal, and was disappointed to see him go to City, as it usually means a stop gap in their career. As a player, he is a tall and lanky striker with a lot of potential. He's an overall good player without any prominent strengths yet. My friend hopes he can become a Lewandowski-esque player in time. He is supposedly one of the best ever prospects that he's seen through  the youth level of turkish international football, and banged them in for fun. Making the step up to senior football was more difficult, and he didn't really break through at the senior level last year. My friend thinks Unal can become world class if he gets play time, and hopes City will loan him out to a Dutch club or back to Turkey for a year or three."

Regarding pools interest in Benteke, apparently they are willing to spend £29m + Lambert for him coming to £32.5m. I know he is quite young and he is an international starter for Belgium but is he really worth that much? Surely that's a lot of money to drop on a player considering Arsenal picked up Sanchez for a similar price. I know they play in different positions but I still assumed that Sanchez would be light years ahead in quality so I it seems to me like Liverpool are overspending a bit no? Any input would be appreciated!"
reddevils,3d8gku,xtfftc,2,Tue Jul 14 10:54:37 2015 UTC,"End of day, who cares .. Money is immaterial for English clubs - you should be asking if the players coming in will improve the first team or not. Benteke brings in something which Strurridge, Balotelli nor Ings possess which is an ability to be a lead man running with pace with his back against the goal. So yes, he adds a dimension - Does that make them better? na."

reddevils,3d8gku,macAaronE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:59:34 2015 UTC,"I think that Chelsea need to strengthen their defense. They were absolutley amazing last season but 1. are ageing, and 2. did very good work/were extremely lucky with their fitness.   Staying virtually injury-free almost the entire season in the PL is absurdly good. And although it is becoming a bit of a trend with Chelsea, I don't think they will be able to replicate this to the same extent. An injury and a suspension - and suddenly they're in crisis mode.  If they do not extend their bench, then I can definitely see someone experienced like Terry suffering a severe loss of form at a crucial period of time and fucking up big time. Which would be amazing.   And if they manage to maintain their injury record as good, we should sign their entire physio staff next summer."

reddevils,3d8gku,Dave1711,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:37:41 2015 UTC,"My understanding so far is that Barcelona has received offers which are accepted but that Pedro hadn't spoken to/agreed yet.  If he does join though, I think we'd see Cuadrado leave maybe. If that's the case I think they've upgraded on him - Pedro seems a bit one-dimensional to be a starter at a Top 4 club but I think he'd be a pretty decent backup/different option to Willian & Hazard"

reddevils,3d8nwj,AMAaboutA,5,Tue Jul 14 15:12:32 2015 UTC,"LvG told depay to stay one more season last season, this year he did want him, but he wanted to sign him after the games ended to not distract the team. Only because PSG were in advanced negotiations LvG called him."
reddevils,3d8nwj,DutchTourist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:29:10 2015 UTC,No he wanted him this season. Memphis was always going to leave after this season in the Eredivisie. LVG wanted him to sign after the season had ended though and PSG forced his hand in that.
reddevils,3d8nwj,januzaj_44,100,Tue Jul 14 12:22:49 2015 UTC,"New GK or De Gea/Lindegaard   Darmian/Valencia----Smalling/Jones----New CB/Rojo----Blind/Shaw                   Carrick/Schweinsteiger  Herrera/Schneiderlin  Schweinsteiger/Fellaini/Di Maria   Mata/Di Maria/Januzaj/Pereira----------------Depay/Young/Di Maria                   Rooney/Depay/Wilson   In:  Depay, Schneiderlin, Schweinsteiger, Darmain, Otamendi  Out: Cleverley, RVP, Angelo Henriquez, Nani, Valdés, Chicharito, Rafael, Evans    1) Why don't you think we should buy a striker and why play Depay at up top?  After LVG hinted at this in the press conference I thought about it and decided it could work.  I'll start off by saying I don't want Depay to play every game at striker, but just to act as backup to Rooney.  I'll also add that if another striker were to come in i wouldn't object, just saying it is not a 100% necessity.  If you look at Depay he is a goalscoring inside forward cutting in from the left on his right foot.  There are plenty of right footed left wingers who's job is to assist and who have a similar number of assists to goals:    Ribery:  21 appearences - 8 goals, 7 assists in 2014/15  Hazard:  45 appearences - 20 goals, 11 assists in 2014/15 (including penalties)  Young:  26 appearences - 2 goals, 5 assists in 2014/15  Di Maria:  30 appearences - 7 goals, 16 assists in 2011/12 (left footed cutting in from right but same thing applies, also not sure when he converted from RW to LCM at Madrid)  But Depay is more of a Ronaldo, Robben or Griezmann who have considerably more goals than assists:  Griezmann: 35 appearences - 16 goals, 3 assists in 2013/14 (when he played as a left winger)  Robben:  28 appearences - 19 goals, 8 assists in 2014/15 (once again left footed from right side of pitch)  Depay:  36 appearences - 26 goals, 5 assists in 2014/15  Ronaldo:  47 appearences - 61 goals, 19 assists in 2014/15  Players in the past like Henry have been sucessfully converted from inside forwards to strikers, more recently Griezmann is another example (he played the majority of his football at striker this season) and Rafa Benitez is rumoured to be doing the same with Ronaldo this season.   Depay has all the attributes needed to be a top striker.  Playing Depay up front will allow more gametime for him as Young and Di Maria plays his position and will be hard to displace, (Di Maria will play elsewhere too but Young is almost exclusively LW) albeit a small amount of gametime.  This is considering that ever since his senior debut at 16 Rooney has never made fewer than 37 appearences in a season.    With no established striker moaning about gametime our captain can play most games, only leaving the odd appearence to Depay and third choice Wilson.  Hopefully there'll be a repeat of the 06/07 season where Rooney made 55 appearences.    2) Why LVG might finally use Di Maria at LCM?  Di Maria played some of his best football at LCM in Madrid.  I think the main reason for this was Ronaldo.  Di Maria was a LCM on the teamsheet but judging by his touch map, he spent most of his time on the left wing utilising his greatest strengths, pace and crossing.  The reason for this was likely because Ronaldo, despite being a LW, spent alot of his time in the centre of the pitch/box looking to score goals meaning he would leave the left flank unmanned if not for Di Maria.  Young isn't an inside forward like Ronaldo (covered above in '1)') so doesn't venture into the box often.  When Young played Di Maria wasn't needed on the left, he couldn't use his strengths in the middle and wasn't really physical enough to play there so was played on the wings instead.  However with the purchase of Depay, an inside forward, this could change as Depay when playing LW would likely venture into the box.    I imagine Di Maria would be alot more likely to play LCM when Depay is playing in the LW role and more likely to be used on either wing when Depay isn't playing or is playing elsewhere (ST).    3) Why Schweinsteiger at CDM and not Schneiderlin?  In a word, experience.  If you look at the top team's ball playing CDMs in recent years most of them are in their 30s when at their peak.  Juventus bought Pirlo when he was 32 and got 4 years out of him, Bayern Munich bought Xabi Alonso at 32 and he has still got it, a 32 year old Thiago Motta is a regular at PSG and Carrick is probably our most important player right now and has improved with age.  Xavi and Scholes both controlled games in their late 30s too.    Schweinsteiger can hopefully follow in these great players footsteps and avoid 'doing a Gerrard' in the deep lying role.  I think he has the footballing intelligence to do so and I hope we get 4 or 5 years out of him.  That being said he doesn't have to play exclusively at CDM, he's still got at least 1 year where he can be useful in front of Carrick.  LVG wouldn't have handed him a 3 year contract to play him as a box-to-box, he can't do that at 34.  I'd like him to play regularly and alot more than the people who are suggesting he was bought to play a 'bit-part' role are suggesting.    Remember we don't have 1 fixed starting XI so the appearences will be spread out between the 4 stand out midfielders we have.  We have depth now so of one player is banned, injured or tired we can still start a strong midfield.  If you asked me to choose my preferences using only these 4 players I'd choose:  1) Carrick  Herrera Schweinsteiger  2) Carrick  Herrera Schneiderlin  3) Schweinsteiger  Herrera Schneiderlin  4) Carrick  Schneiderlin Schweinsteiger  With Fellaini being used mainly as a second half impact sub, Di Maria as a possibility at LCM when Depay plays (mentioned above in the '2)') and Blind as cover/competition for the injury prone/hot and cold Shaw.  For those who aren't familar and want to avoid researching, I'll say Schneiderlin usually played towards the left in a 4231 system, Schweinsteiger normally played towards the left of Alonso in the midfield 3 of the 433 formation, also playing the deeper central role on the odd occasion, Herrera played right of Carrick in our 433 system, Carrick only plays centre in our 433 system.    Even though they aren't entirlely relevant here I'll say Ramos/Otamendi play LCB at their clubs, Smalling RCB, Rojo LCB, Jones has played both.  Ramos and Otamendi are both right footed though so could in theory play either left or right too."

reddevils,3d8nwj,januzaj_44,6,Tue Jul 14 11:19:28 2015 UTC,"True, I think he will be primarily a winger, if he stays that is.

reddevils,3d8nwj,chrisgorm,5,Tue Jul 14 11:41:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, everything reads good tho, nice piece.  Our midfield if fully fit next season will be brilliant"
reddevils,3d8nwj,ReaperX24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:08:19 2015 UTC,But if we do sell him it's more likely we are going to replace him simply because he will be sold for a lot of money and will free up wages as well. That money should go to use.
reddevils,3d8nwj,Zico568,3,Tue Jul 14 11:11:22 2015 UTC,"1) Why don't you think we should buy a striker and why play Depay at up top?   I was thoroughly against this and i still am, however since the boss mentioned he is actually considering playing him there il remain taking a more modest but still very sceptical position on this.  You made at least some good points as to why he could be tried as a striker. My own objections come mainly from a couple of observations.  Last season Memphis started taking a freer role (whether he was instructed to do so or chose to so himself, remains unclear). Resulting in quite a bad or at best very average performance for quite some games. His positioning was poor and often narrowing down free spaces in the field for fellow players and possible lines of passing. Also highlighted by some pundits.  This makes me to believe Memphis does not posess the positioning and instincts of a true striker (yet). Looking at the quality added in our squad recently and the ambitious goals set coming year doesn't strike me as a proper context in which we should try and give an unproved striker (hes sofar even unproved at his best position in the BPL) the chance to develop these skills during the season. Not knowing if he will be able to do a proper job at all and also taking time for e.g. Wilson to continue his development (i rate him higher as a striker from what I've seen).  Also last year PSV faced with a striker problem took a big gamble on buying and starting de Jong. Only because Cocu backed him up after a horrendous start (of quite a lot of games) we can now say from hindsight it was a good choice. However PSV, knowing Depay from early youth teams, clearly rather take this gamble than putting Depay on top instead. Surely this must mean something.   2) Why LVG might finally use Di Maria at LCM?   The way you describe his role at Madrid and why he was succesful there is exactly why he should be played a winger in van Gaal's 4-3-3 because its pretty much the same role however in a more compact field (because of the very high line van Gaals wants the whole team to play), which might proof some difficulties for Di Maria because you need extra qualities.   The LCM/RCM role has far more defensive, controlling and playmaking duties and this is not Di Maria's strong point from what I've seen sofar.   3) Why Schweinsteiger at CDM and not Schneiderlin?   Dont fully agree but to prevent the answer getting even longer, Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin are very different players. I put Schneiderlin on LCM next to Herrera and would probably even prefer Blind replacing Carrick or Schweinsteiger with him in front to keep balance in midfield in place. I dont think Schneiderlin is that much of an upgrade to Blind on that position (at least for now).  Anywas thought i react for some discussion, you got some good points so it was interesting to read."
reddevils,3d8nwj,januzaj_44,3,Tue Jul 14 11:13:39 2015 UTC,"I would like a striker as long as he accepts Rooney plays up front most of the games he's fit (I don't want Rooney in midfield).  I think Di Maria will mainly play on the wings, just a larger possibility than last season that he plays LCM."
reddevils,3d8nwj,Zico568,2,Tue Jul 14 14:05:00 2015 UTC,"I agree although looking at it from a rational and objective point of view, we should sign the best striker possible and if that striker is better, Rooney should be benched. However i dont think thats very likely, but objectively it doesn't make sense to buy a elite/very strong players on every position except for the arguably most important spot on the field because we cant bench someone."
reddevils,3d8nwj,stevenmadden,4,Tue Jul 14 11:47:09 2015 UTC,"Di Maria: 30 appearences - 7 goals, 16 assists in 2011/12 (left footed cutting in from right but same thing applies, also not sure when he converted from RW to LCM at Madrid)   Just to clear this up for you. He was converted to LCM during his last season at Madrid. He already had a lot of experience playing in that position for his national team. Since Bale was signed for such a huge amount of money, it was obvious that he was going to make the right wing position his own, with Cristiano on the left, and you're not going to bench a guy like Di Maria.   Also Di Maria used to play on the left wing for Benfica, and while playing as LCM for Madrid, he drifted a lot to the left wing while Cristiano was moving into the center.   I gotta say that their midfield during that season consisting of Di Maria, Xabi Alonso and Modrić was spectacular to watch."

I hope LvG try to give him a chance there. I love Memphis, but he's gonna need time to adapt, especially if he's going to be mold into a striker. So yeah, I hope ADM can be first choice for LW if he's still at United. ADM on the left and Mata on the right could make either Rooney or Ander score a lot."

reddevils,3d8nwj,GrapeBread,24,Tue Jul 14 11:58:03 2015 UTC,"---------------------------- De Gea -----------------------------  ----------- Smalling/Jones -------- Rojo/CB ------------------  Darmian ------------------------------------------- Shaw/Blind  ------------------ Carrick/Schweinsteiger --------------------  ------ Herrerra/Fellaini -------------- Schneiderlin/Fellaini --  Depay/Mata ------------------------------------- Young/Di Maria  --------------------------- Rooney -------------------------------     This will be our primary formation in the league. For those names which I have left by themselves (e.g. Rooney, Darmian), they will start in their position if fit, no matter who we face.  For the rest of them, I expect to see a lot of rotation based on who we are facing.   Let's start with the midfield:   Facing a strong defensive unit (e.g. Chelsea, Crystal Palace):  I would expect Carrick to start at the base of the midfield, since facing a tight defensive team would probably mean we have a majority of the possession. We'd need a distributor, and Carrick is by far the best.  Note: In the particular example of Chelsea, we'd probably see both Carrick and Basti play, for experience more than anything. Otherwise, I think we'll rarely see them play together.  Also, in this scenario, we'd probably see Fellaini start in one of the CM positions, due to his physicality and height advantage - this could be critical in breaking down teams which park the bus. Facing a team which likes to hold possesion (e.g. Southampton, Arsenal):  LVG's philosophy is all about recycling possession, so when we face teams who tend to hold the ball longer, I would expect to see Carrick favoured over Basti. Neither are particularly aggressive 'destroyers' (I would expect most of our pressing to come from the front, i.e. Herrera and Schneiderlin), but Carrick is much better suited to collecting the ball from the back and spreading it wide/forward. It is tempting to go with a workhorse like Basti against teams who hold the ball, but these teams make it their bread and butter dealing with opponents who run all day - you'd need someone who can sit back and wait for the ball to come to him before releasing the forwards.  As mentioned above, in this scenario I would expect Herrera and Schneiderlin to both start, based on their ability to press high up the pitch and regain and keep possession. We will most likely be playing with an extremely high line against these teams (less space on the pitch for them to pass, pretty standard tactics), meaning the ability to press up the pitch is key. We could potentially see Schweini play in one of the CM positions in games like these (as before, maybe against Arsenal with his experience in big games). Facing a team which is likely to play direct football (e.g. Liverpool, Stoke):  I'd expect to see Basti favoured over Carrick in these games. He would make a better shield in front of our back line, and would allow for more direct counter-attacking football than Carrick, who is a less accomplished dribbler.  Herrera and Schneiderlin would again be the preferred choices here. The two would be ideal box-to-box players against direct teams, since they are able to maintain possession as well as run all day long.   In all these scenarios, Blind can serve as a potential back-up at CDM. However, I don't think we'll see him much there this season - he'll play most of his football at LB.    Now, let's look at the back line:  The back line will be much less susceptible to change based on who we are facing.  Depending on whether or not we buy another CB, I think LVG will pick his CBs based solely on match fitness and footed-ness, i.e. Rojo will most likely always start at Left CB, and Smalling and Jones will rotate Right CB. If all are fit, Smalling and Rojo will be the number 1 pairing.  RB is self-explanatory. Darmian will start day-in, day-out, since our only other option is Valencia. The only time I expect Valencia to start would be against weaker opposition and potentially in FA Cup or League Cup games, and to give Darmian a rest. A lot is going to be riding on this kid, hope he is up for it.  LB is interesting. I think Shaw will be favoured to start over Blind (for pace alone, more than anything), but in games where we play less direct opponents, I can easily see Blind starting due to his match awareness.    Now, for the forward line:  Rooney will start every game he can, bar injury. There is no doubt about that. Our only other cover is Wilson (who I expect we will see a lot of this season, if only because of the sheer number of games we have). Our only other two options are Depay and Januzaj, but I doubt we will see either of them lead the line much, bar a stunning vein of goal-scoring form from either.  RW is interesting. I expect Mata will start initially, but he will be aware of both Depay and Januzaj knocking at his door for their opportunity. I expect he will play in games against opponents who play direct and those that sit back (like he did against Liverpool and Crystal Palace last season, scoring in both), but I don't think we will see him start against teams that hold the ball - we'd need more pace and directness to counter that.  LW will be a straight shoot-out between Di Maria and Young. Di Maria is clearly the more obvious choice, but Young was (I dare say) simply the better player last season. Will be interesting to see how this one goes - I'd have to favour Di Maria at this stage.  Depay and Januzaj have the added benefit that they can pretty much play anywhere across the front line, so I doubt we will see them confined to any particular position as the season progresses.    Well, that's my two cents!"
reddevils,3d8nwj,januzaj_44,6,Tue Jul 14 13:06:16 2015 UTC,"To me, Fellaini's key role will be against small clubs that will try to nick a point or 3 through set pieces and sitting back in defense."
reddevils,3d8nwj,arnm7890,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:56:02 2015 UTC,"I think he has the potential to be a great sub as well. One consistent feature of a great team is the ability to switch up your style when needed.  No matter how good your team and coach is, you never go through 38 matches without your game-plan failing sometimes. When you're at the 75 minute mark in a 0-0 game, or trailing 1-0, you want the ability to try something different. Even when he was criticized for it last year, I liked LVG's willingness to switch it up and throw Fellaini up top as a striker to collect long-balls in the box. It may not be the prettiest, but the whole point is to switch up your style of attack, see if the opponent can handle the switch."

I would like to see us get another striker as well (and move Chicharito on to the MLS), but there aren't any strikers available who are:   Good enough to fill in for Rooney Not so good that they get frustrated by lack of playing time   Remember, Rooney will start almost every game - he is the Captain. There's just no striker available who can match that description. Ideally, this sort of role would be perfect for an Eto'o type player, who is happy to sit on the bench but who can also do the job when called upon.

Ander brings a cohesion to our midfield like no one else but I feel, Mata is the better playmaker.  Depay would most probably take time to make the transition from Eredivisie to PL. I don't expect him to be explosive or consistent at the beginning. So Young at LW then? Or shift AdM to the left and Mata to the right?"

CDM role will demand a lot of sideways movement backwards, depending on who we put in midfield. The least pressure on him would probably be playing Blind/Herrera/Fellaini alongside him even if that is somewhat less effective going forward. His ankles would do well if he had mainly an attacking responsibility too though, right? Kind of like we imagined we could do with Rooney last year when Herrera/Blind played behind him in midfield? The player tracks back but the main responsibility is creating shit/dictating play forward? That's where I want to see him anyway."

There was a thread a few months back about how LVG traditionally prefers his midfield triangle to be pointing forward (2 CMs behind a CAM), rather than the backwards one that we've been using (Carrick behind Fellaini/Herrera).

Then Wilson might get a few minutes here and there, van Gaal takes pride in developing players. I also think Depay can be deployed as a striker, van Gaal even said that he is capable of that.  And at last, I think van Gaal considers Fellaini as a striker. He will play the role of the ""Plan B"" player who can come on when we're desperate for a goal, and we'll feed him crosses. He is such an imposing figure, he will naturally draw much attention, when deployed he will often make the opposition put 2 players on him, otherwise he is too dangerous."

reddevils,3d8nwj,greatmoo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:56:16 2015 UTC,Why Memphis on the right? I've seen a lot of posts here with Memphis at RW but to my knowledge he always plays inverted winger on the left like Ronaldo.
reddevils,3d8nwj,beckham2k2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:44:13 2015 UTC,"The reason I put Memphis on the right is with a 3-4-3 we'd want the wingers to be counter-attacking a lot and also going infield to make room for the wingbacks, so if a ball is played into the channel, you'd want somebody with pace and strength to be able to latch onto it for a snapshot - which would be easier if the right-footed player is on the right.  But mostly I've put him in because I wanted Young and Depay in there for the aforementioned pace reasons.  Memphis more often than not plays LW, but during games has been known to switch wings (especially recently when playing with Narsingh on the RW, not so much when Robben is in the team though)"
reddevils,3d8nwj,redsquare13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:42:32 2015 UTC,"Gotta split the line-up so we get all the Romance language speakers on one side, and all the Germanic language speakers on the other:  --------------------Keeper X-------------  Darmian-----Rojo-----Smalling---Blind  -----------------Carrick-------------------  --------Herrera--------Schweinsteiger-  Di Maria--------Rooney-----Memphis--"
reddevils,3d8nwj,MylesVE,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"I really like 4-2-3-1. I know it's unlikely to be played but I think we'll often times field a team that will look more like a 4-2-3-1 than a 4-3-3 at times, especially against strong teams, requiring our wingers to pull back a bit further and depend more on a reliable middle to play them in on a quick counter. Basically, have the two MC/DM commit more to defense and allow the AMC role to commit far more to attack and track back not as much.  -------------De Gea--------------   Darmian-Smalling-Rojo-Shaw    ------Carrick---Schneiderlin-----  Dima--------Mata--------Depay  -------------Rooney---------------  As much as I love Blind, I think we should have another LB who is faster in case Shaw gets injured again (low priority) and Blind as a versatile back-up. Though, if Dima plays LCM with Depay on LW, I probably wouldn't hesitate to play Blind ahead of Shaw. So maybe we don't need it. We will need a CB though if Rojo does end up filling LB more often than we hoped.  To be honest, I haven't watched a lot of Schweinsteiger's game. But I'm sure he can replace either Carrick or Schneiderlin to influence the game differently. Same with Herrera, but less likely to play with just him and Schneiderlin as the two.  Mata becomes a more important member in this situation and I think he can step it up even more. He's done great last season and personally am excited to see how much more he'll improve in the squad. I think we can also try playing Dima in AMC ahead of a more defensive 2 and let him play in our wingers with his passes, especially now that we got Depay who likes to cut in for a chance to score. Mata can play AMR so they can be really dynamic AMC-AMR combo.   Herrera can play there to allow the him at AMC and the two DMs to all play more dynamically and turn it into a 3 MC formation. And Fellaini can do his thing there, too, like he did this past season. Makes AMC a very special position... we have all types of way to use that position depending on the opposition, and Schneiderlin and Schweinsteiger signings allow it to be possible. And if Darmian and right side midfield turns out pretty solid, we can try Januzaj in some games and see what he does with less responsibilities in defense. Not sure how that will affect Pereira.  Our two recent big money signings Mata and Dima, we know what they can do with their creativity, and I feel that the way Van Gaal has the midfield play limits some of their flair. These two attacking more freely, I think, will gives us the biggest potential of winning the league and other titles in the future. Bet it'll be more fun to watch, too.  Don't think we need a new striker. We got Wilson, Depay, Chicha, thus time to wait for the right player.   I think we got the depth and type of players to play almost anything and defend its logic soundly, really. But I want to see the area behind Rooney used better and link up midfield and attack centrally. We got the players to make it happen more regularly."
reddevils,3d8nwj,Jimaaadude,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:00:23 2015 UTC,More of these formation megathreads may come about when this thread gets old and people decide they need to ask what formation we're gunna play next season yet again. And again...And again...   Might as well just make them daily then :P
reddevils,3d8nwj,JeSuisLouis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:11:45 2015 UTC,"I think our formation will be a 4-1-2-3 (a.k.a the 4-3-3 we ended the season with). I use 4-1-2-3 for clarity and to form a distinction between the 'no.6' and the 'b2b no. 8' roles.   Our back four is straightforward, the defenders will be close together when we are about to lose the ball or have lost the ball.  When we are attacking, the fullbacks will go forward, the centre backs will spread out to cover half of the pitch each and the no.6 midfielder (Carrick/Schweinsteiger or Blind/Schneiderlin if both are injured) will drop in between the centre backs and move the ball forward out of defence.  The box to box midfielders (Herrera and Schneiderlin, most likely) will be mobile in defence and act in conjunction with the full backs when defending on the wing. When defending attacks through the middle, they will try and force the opponent out wide or into a tightly packed space where the no.6 can win the ball back.  When we are attacking, the box-to-box mids will try and operate between the lines of the opponent's midfield and defence, with the end goal of finding any one of the front 3 in space (Memphis, Rooney, Mata, then ADM to replace Mata when he is fit and back in 'good rhythm').  When the attack is on the right side, the Right Back (Darmian), the RCM (Herrera) and the RW (Mata/ADM) will form a triangle and try and move the opponent's full back out of position or draw a centre back out of the back line, creating space for a runner. On the left side, it will be the opposite players (Shaw, Schneiderlin, Memphis).  When the right side is attacking, the left winger will come in to offer a second option on the edge of the box (in addition to the centre forward, Rooney). The LCM will offer a release ball if the attacking triangle on the right is put under pressure. The DM will offer a second release and cover the space left by the attacking full back in the back line. This is vital as we need to recycle possession, so the centre mids will need to ensure that they do not stray too far from one another.  Finally, the wingers and forward. The wingers will double up with the fullbacks when defending attacks from wide areas, and the forward will come short for release passes once we regain possession. In this situation, Rooney's strength and control will need to be on point to prevent loss of possession - if he can hold the ball up, a counter attack could be initiated.  When we are on the attack, the wingers and forward are vital to chance creation. The wingers must be disciplined and not try unnecessarily optimistic runs; the ball should be passed into the midfield if there is no way through on the wing. When the winger is in a position to cross, the RCM should be positioned outside the box to provide a cut-back option, the RB should drop back a bit in case the cross is blocked and the DM should not push too far forward in case a cross is cleared. The LCM should offer an option in the box around the penalty area (last season, Felli was going into the box even if the ball was on the left. This is because Herrera probably can't header and Felli is a beast. I imagine Schneiderlin may do the same) and the Centre Forward should make movements to receive the ball and put it in. 1-0 United? Yes, please. The Left Winger should stay past the far post or on the opposite corner of the box in case of a deflection or overhit cross. The left back and two centre backs will form a stretched back line during advanced stages of attack.   Idk what everyone thinks about this but in theory I see our players fitting in to the 4-3-3 in the above way.  To summarise:   Our centre backs and full backs need to be positionally aware and strong on the ball in order to retain possession, especially in tight situations/under pressure. Additionally, the centre backs must be quick in getting back when a counter attacck happens and must also be fast in forming a tight/stretched defensive line depending on the situation. The DM should cover the back line and offer a passing option when the ball is with the full backs or box to box mids. The box to boxers must be mobile and ruthlessly exploit any lapses in discipline from the opposition.  The striker must do his best to keep the centre backs deep to create space between the lines for the midfielders to exploit, or even pull the full-backs or centre-backs out of position for the wingers to make runs.   Thoughts? Sorry I'm a day late, I had a cake hangover from the birthday."

reddevils,3d8nwj,JeSuisLouis,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:36:40 2015 UTC,"I see all the formation suggested here are back 4, my question is, will LVG tempted to retry 3-5-2 again ( at least for weaker teams)?  Darmian/Valencia and Shaw are well capable to run up and town for the game while we have so many options for CB (assuming they are all healthy) and Midfield.   With Schweinsteiger / carrick / blind / schneiderlin in CDM rotation. i feel like 3-5-2 is well capable for LVG to test the water once again."
reddevils,3d8nwj,Funkyy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:40:50 2015 UTC,"I think we could also play a 532 with ease as an alternative. As in 3cbs, 2 wing backs, 2 cms, 2 wingers and a central striker.   Gk-De gea Lcb-Rojo/Blind Cb-Jones/?new guy Rcb-Smalling Lwb-Shaw/Blind Rwb-Darmian/Valencia Both Cm-We're stacked but I would pick Bastian and Herrera RW-Depay/Mata/Adnan LW-Angel/Young/Adnan Striker-Rooney/Wilson/Depay  I think it's an really good alternative now cos our mids is a lot more solid and we both our wingbacks are known for their attacking runs down the sides. IMHO we just need a guy like Ramos or Otamendi to make the backline perfect for this. As it is the backline has a good passing ability, speed and strength. We just lack experience back there.   I'm really pumped for the season to start and hope we sign an experienced CB. We will show them the United swagger of yesteryear hopefully."

reddevils,3d8nwj,JeSuisLouis,5,Tue Jul 14 13:08:58 2015 UTC,"To all four commentators above and below: no I am not joking, and I watched football at least since the early '80's. I also have watched LvG's beginning as a coach at Ajax and have alway been a close follower of his career. I'm also not trolling.  I think LvG always looks for multi-functional players and he has also more then once used players on different positions or changed players position (for example Schweinsteiger's and Lahm@ bayern, Reiziger, RdeBoer, Davids, Roy and Blind @ Ajax, and the list goes on ). I believe that in LvG tactics he wants to have atleast 1 player in the back that is able to build-up from behind. Not with long balls but with passes. Blind is a good passer and Schneiderlin also. Shaw isn't (well atleast not that he has shown yet). Although Shaw might defensively give more security then blind because of his speed I do think Blind and Schneiderlin might be the 2 guys that fight for the Left back position or the postion right in front of the defenders in a 4-3-3 because of their better passing. Blind showed he can build up pretty good last year but was quite a few times vulnerable as left back and that's why I think Schneiderlin might do better there. He's got more body and defensive strength end still has a good pass. With blind in front of the back four also the passing from midfield toward the attack is covered.  It's an idea I think that LvG might at some point try and I wouldn't mind him doing so. Of course I'm not sure he will or that it's needed Maybe Shaw will become a better passer indeed or we get antoher defender (CB) that is also a good passer. Anyway just saying I did put a little thought into my line up indeed.      Edit: spelling"

I would bow down to you if it happens but I can only see that happening in the most severe of injury crisis's. For possible LB options we now have Shaw, Blind, Rojo, Darmian, Blackett, Young and I would even throw Evans in there before you even consider Schniderlin."
reddevils,3d9a4a,ErsatzEmu,78,Tue Jul 14 14:33:34 2015 UTC,It's sad to see that we have to get rid of a player who has the talent and the desire because he's unlucky enough to be made of glass.   Such is life.
reddevils,3d9a4a,mufctez,12,Tue Jul 14 14:39:51 2015 UTC,"I see this repeated here and it is very frustrating. There is a myth on here that he is some sort of glass full back. He isn't. He has had his share of injuries but, apart from last season, it hasn't been all that bad for a defender in his early 20s playing in the PL. His average per season before 2014/15 was 26.3 games per season. For the same period, Darmian (who is one year older), has an average of 24.2. Actually that's probably not fair since Darmian only played 6 games for Milan in 2008/2009. His average games per season without it are 28.4. Last season was undeniably amazing for Darmian (47) and terrible for Rafael (11) but looking at the seasons before that shows some perspective.  I don't care that people here think he has ""desire"" or is ""bubbly"". He has had 200 games and this is good enough for a player that is yet to hit 25.  P.S. Apparently Rafael turned 25 last week. So a belated happy birthday!"
reddevils,3d9a4a,xtfftc,4,Tue Jul 14 18:52:31 2015 UTC,It's clearly a quality thing. Van Gaal didn't play him when he was fit either.
reddevils,3d9a4a,clumsy__runner,8,Tue Jul 14 20:37:10 2015 UTC,The injuries always disrupted his momentum though. When he could put together healthy stretches he was killing it. I'll never forget that one season he and Zabaleta were the clear two best fullbacks in the league (and I thought Rafa was better anyway)
reddevils,3d9a4a,grindandshine,5,Tue Jul 14 21:37:46 2015 UTC,Quality? Rafael on his worst day is a better full back than Valencia on his best

reddevils,3d9a4a,devilsway,2,Thu Jul 16 01:11:54 2015 UTC,"No no no. Van Gaal wanted stability last season, and was willing to sacrifice individual quality to make the team overall more stable. Which made perfect sense, considering the changes in management, new system, signings, everything - you need stability in such a situation because otherwise it becomes too chaotic.  So van Gaal tried playing Rafael for a while, but the mid-season injuries were too much and by the time Rafael recovered, Valencia was already a part of the system."
reddevils,3d9a4a,xtfftc,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:50:33 2015 UTC,Injuries -> Loss of momentum -> Less time playing once back
reddevils,3d9a4a,T11PES,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:33:09 2015 UTC,"It hasn't been all that bad for a defender in his early 20s playing in the PL. His average per season before 2014/15 was 26.3 games per season.   That's one way to look at it.  The other is that in that period of 5 years he has been injured for 305 days, missing 51 games, from 11 separate injuries (referencing from transfermarkt.com).    It is an absolutely fair judgment as you'd want your first choice players to be available for selection when you need him.  Zabaleta and Ivanovic have both averaged 40+ games per season, each missing just 10 games from 4 injuries and 10 from 2 respectively.  That's what you want from your first choice.  In that same period Darmian's been injured 57 days, missing 8 games from just 2 injuries.  I'm a big fan of Rafael but he's not what you want if you're looking for consistency and availability to be in your starting eleven."
reddevils,3d9a4a,devilsway,3,Wed Jul 15 05:59:59 2015 UTC,"Oh, by all means - I am misrepresenting statistics to fit my narrative, no denying that. We do need more consistency, and Rafael does need to get more durable if he is to play at a top level.  But, even with the injuries, he has made his fair share of contributions. He might not be comparable to Ivanovic and Zabaleta, but is comparable to Darmian (a player at his age, not five years older). And, since people love repeating the same thing over and over again without a critical thought - about any issue, no just Rafael - I think we need to have a look at other arguments.  And, more importantly, this is a club-wide issue. Something is wrong, and it's not just last season - we have been seeing more and more injuries year after year. This is our main problem."
reddevils,3d9a4a,xtfftc,-6,Wed Jul 15 06:43:04 2015 UTC,"I see this repeated here and it is very frustrating. There is a myth on here that he is some sort of top class full back. He isn't. He is error prone, positionally poor and makes mistakes. He is easily bullied by opposing teams and is rightly targeted. Leicester are an example from last season, but it's happened plenty of times before. My seat in Old Trafford is close enough to where he would be in the second half of most games and I know I'm far from the only one around who thinks like this.   I don't care that people here think he has ""desire"" or is ""bubbly"". He has had 200 games and isn't good enough. He'll find his level at a team below the highest levels."
reddevils,3d9a4a,WillyMorganOnTheWing,12,Tue Jul 14 16:16:42 2015 UTC,Rafael was on a (undeserved) yellow for Leicester ' s comeback. He was doing fine before that.

Rafa is a gun who has been cruelled by injury   What does that even mean? I think the English language has been ""cruelled"" by your sentence.

reddevils,3d9a4a,Sir_Bryan,4,Tue Jul 14 17:05:42 2015 UTC,It's such a shame he has to go. Even during the 13/14 season he was the difference between Valencia being effective on the right wing or not and considering how many attacks were forced down the right during the Moyes era he was very important.

He was one of the better full backs in the Premiership. However, he was still suspect defensively.    People exxagerate how bad he is at defending just because he's made a few memorable mistakes.

It's not like he has amazing positioning does he?   I don't see where I claimed Valencia had ""amazing positioning"". Nevertheless, he is steadier and far, far less likely to be bullied by the opposition. I simply believe he has a better tactical brain. He won't make the same naive, rash decisions Rafael will make.    It's not positioning that was rafaels problem. It was lunging into tackles and injuries. He was doing great against Ronaldo across 2 legs in the CL ffs.   That's hardly a ringing endorsement. I see his positional issues as being directly related to his rash decisions. He simply forgets about his principle responsibilities and does stupid things. Diving in and being headless are connected. He also was a major problem in the away leg against Madrid. I felt United were in danger any time the ball went near him. Don't forget how many times De Gea had to pull off saves due to the madness going on in front of him.    Everyone who instantly mentions poor positioning and defending as soon as Rafael is mentioned has jumped on the band wagon.   Please don't tell me why I believe something or claim incorrectly that this is something that has seen me jump on a band wagon. It isn't. I have been saying it for years.

Therefore he was also one of the best in the world.  Secondly it is just a few memorable mistakes. You're blanking out all the perfect games he's had both offensively and defensively and only remembering the games where he's made a mistake. As I said before, if he made as many as you've implied, he would've been sold long ago.  Rafael did nothing wrong during the game against Real despite all his haters expecting him to do so. All the issues came down Evra's wing or through our midfield. He had a great game.  I'm not saying I don't see why Van Gaal doesn't like him. Of course he has areas that he can improve. As I said before, his defending isn't near perfect, (but then again, what fullback has near perfect defending apart from people like Lahm) but that in no way means it's bad. Of course this is an assumption but I honestly don't think we would've finished any lower if Rafael started all the games in place of Valencia despite all this talk of Rafael having no brain. Rafael is solid defensively and adds more in attack.  The fact that we were conceding when we shouldn't have been earlier in the season had nothing to do with him. It was our midfield being disorganized so people were passing right through the middle.  He is absolutely good enough to start for us. That shouldn't even be a debate."

reddevils,3d9a4a,WuutWuut,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"And reports like this ensure that we'll never get a decent fee now. The reason we get crushed on our sales is because we always make it clear to our players and everyone else when their time at United is finished.   United getting crushed on sales has nothing to do with what they tell the media or a player's agent.  United 'get crushed' on sales because they're not a selling club, and they only consider selling players when they're not worth very much. LVG could talk up Rafael all offseason if he wanted, but he wouldn't command much of a fee, since he's coming off a season when he clearly couldn't break into the team, barely played and was injured. Combine that with him being in the final year of his contract, and nobody's offering much of anything.  If you want to get good fees for selling players, you have to sell them at their peak. We could get a great price for Rojo right now I'm sure, or Januzaj last year, because they were coming off good seasons. But whenever a player is coming off a good year, United isn't interested in selling."
reddevils,3d9a4a,tmlrule,24,Tue Jul 14 22:07:01 2015 UTC,Kind of ruthless. Why not keep him and let him fight especially if he wants to stay. He isnt making Van Parsies salary. I don't like it
reddevils,3d9a4a,gosha1988,13,Tue Jul 14 15:00:46 2015 UTC,"Sure. But it's clear he's 3rd choice at best anyway. Even if he's fit Valencia plays ahead of him when Darmian is rested.   And maybe LvG sees McNair or someone else as a capable 3rd option instead too if needed.   He definitely can stay if he wants but that's the order of things as LvG probably pointed out. So for his own sake, it makes little sense to stay and hopefully be second choice at a stretch."
reddevils,3d9a4a,Feezbull,2,Tue Jul 14 15:24:54 2015 UTC,"I get what you mean, but it doesn't look like he's even second choice anymore. Behind Darmian and Toni, I think it makes sense for LVG to be looking to talent in the youth pool.  Don't forget both Jones and McNair can play at RB in the event that we're struck down with a ton of injuries."
reddevils,3d9a4a,bagombos_enough_box,6,Tue Jul 14 16:38:23 2015 UTC,We also have Varela - who apparently impressed in the Real Madrid camp
reddevils,3d9a4a,daniam1,2,Tue Jul 14 16:47:51 2015 UTC,Wouldn't take a lot to impress in Real Madrid castilla to be honest. They are playing in the Spanish third division IIRC.
reddevils,3d9a4a,Xanian123,4,Tue Jul 14 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"I remember a Bayern fan telling us to prepare for unpopular decisions by LVG. This and the RVP sale are so dissapointing. Rafael has given his absolute all for us in every game, he should atleast run out his contract."
reddevils,3d9a4a,Yan-e-toe,2,Tue Jul 14 20:29:52 2015 UTC,"Unpopular decisions, but in hindsight probably the right ones."

reddevils,3d9a4a,T11PES,4,Wed Jul 15 00:34:20 2015 UTC,Not surprising. Hopefully we get a good price for him. We are not messing around with business this year.
reddevils,3d9a4a,Nostrabrahmus,3,Tue Jul 14 14:38:54 2015 UTC,That's annoying.
reddevils,3d9a4a,Irishane,6,Tue Jul 14 18:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't get it. Why can't he just stick around and fight for a spot? We all know he can be world class if he's fit. It's not like he's on astronomical wages. If he wants to leave after riding the bench for a year, I understand. But why force him out?"
reddevils,3d9a4a,sawmeal,10,Tue Jul 14 14:58:55 2015 UTC,"""if he's fit...""   You just answered your question.  That and, he doesn't seem to fit the mold of RBs that Van Gaal wants."
reddevils,3d9a4a,mkenya4t,9,Tue Jul 14 15:02:48 2015 UTC,"What kind of RB does Van Gaal want?  Rafa can be pretty solid defensively and great going front. In my eyes, he's the perfect backup RB, much more reliable than Valencia (who is way more positionally suspect).   We can afford to keep him on our books and if he's willing to stay a backup, why not? Worst case he leaves of his own accord in a year or two. Best case, he overcomes his fitness issues and competes to become our starting RB"
reddevils,3d9a4a,sawmeal,5,Tue Jul 14 15:13:03 2015 UTC,"Rafa has always been a bit rash and careless when going into tackles.    He's also prone to bombing forward and leaving a gap on his wing.   To me, It comes down to the right side players. Because Herrera and Mata are where our offensive and penetrative play comes from,  the RB has to be more defensively sound because he covers for two players. The RB also has to he able to stretch play when necessary. Valencia was able to do that much better than Rafa. Darmian will be even better at that role."
reddevils,3d9a4a,mkenya4t,2,Tue Jul 14 15:22:32 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your assessment on Valencia (to be fair, it looks like LVG agrees with you though ha). We've seen just how liable Valencia can be at the back. He had several high-profile lapses last season. Not really his fault, he's definitely not a RB. And I don't think Valencia can be counted upon to be creative offensively. I think he's best as a defensive winger for the big games where we need to shut down one side of the field.   I just think Rafael could possibly turn things around and since he loves the club, wants to stay and isn't on exorbitant wages, we could use him.  This is precedence for what I'm suggesting too. With the same scenario, Wes Brown would have been shipped off a long time ago. But Fergie stuck with him and kept him in the team. The 07/08 season was gold for him and I'd argue he had a pretty significant role in the team that year."
reddevils,3d9a4a,sawmeal,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:33:07 2015 UTC,"Sometimes it's more about the system than it is about the player. Sure Rafa is a better RB than Valencia on paper, that's definitely true. He just doesn't fit the system required for the right side to operate well. Even with his defensive lapses, Valencia simply does a better job of what the system requires.   Take for example,  Dani Alves. Very similar style of RB to Rafa. He bombs forward a lot to link with Messi. Rakitic is tasked with providing cover for Alvez when he's forward. To have the same for us, we'd have Ander playing deeper to cover for Rafa which isn't utilizing the best of Anders talents. Valencia/Matteo provide better defensive cover for Herrera and Mata to operate and unlock defenses as they should."
reddevils,3d9a4a,mkenya4t,3,Tue Jul 14 16:09:49 2015 UTC,"I think there is a place for him in LVG's system though. Let's look at the left flank for example. When Shaw played, he was consistently bombing forward, LVG alluded to his fitness problems with prefacing it with the need to have stamina to go forward as well as track back. When he was out and Blind stepped in, I seem to remember him playing pretty high up and combining with our attackers. Having midfielders cover for other players going forward is a very Dutch school of thought. It adds for a more varied attack I think.  I do agree that Rafa would have to be far more perceptive in putting pressure up the field. Not necessarily something he's tactically astute enough to pull off. So maybe that's something that LVG is wary of"
reddevils,3d9a4a,sawmeal,0,Tue Jul 14 18:35:05 2015 UTC,Because LVG doesn't trust him. He was fit towards the end of the season and LVG still started Valencia.
reddevils,3d9a4a,jbiresq,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:16:16 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that was when we were on a little run. Valencia, Mata and Herrera were combining beautifully, can't mess with a winning combination. I think Rafa would benefit from this pre-season. Working with a consistent approach. Never thought of him as a particularly intelligent player, he seems to operate on instinct. Having a set system to work in would bring the best out in him imo."
reddevils,3d9a4a,sawmeal,4,Tue Jul 14 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"He isn't being forced out at all. He's just been told he's basically third choice at best now. So he can well stay and try and become second choice. But it's not smart to do so when he's not even going to be a bench option even in league cup games because there likely is one of McNair or someone else who could even challenge for that spot.   And if he feels he can finally stay fit, he knows he's going to be fighting hard only to still be a backup.    He just has been told this clearly so it was left up to him to decide if he's fine with that or to move.   He hasn't been told- we want you gone. More of, you're no longer backup because that's Valencia now and so, it's up to you to decide but we would listen to offers perhaps."

reddevils,3d9a4a,jaanmek,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:46 2015 UTC,"60k is nothing for United. It's a risk we can afford to take. There is potential payoff in keeping someone who's been loyal to the team and pretty solid RB. He's also ONLY 25. So he could improve in the future (with regards to fitness and his ""rashness""). Or come off the bench when we need him to. Don't tell me the thought of someone like him as a backup isn't a particularly enticing thought."
reddevils,3d9a4a,sawmeal,4,Tue Jul 14 15:42:47 2015 UTC,"I'd love a fit Rafael as back. Heck in my opinion a guy Rafael is first team quality. My issue is that we just can't count on him. There comes a time where you just have to cut your losses. Taking the last few seasons into consideration, if Darmian got injured, the chances are Rafael would be on the treatment table too, so he's not much use as back up. His injuries will only get worse with age (they always do)."

reddevils,3d8p1n,Dats_cute,8,Tue Jul 14 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"Agreed, 100% - he'll likely be top scorer before hitting 30.  Definition of a legend?  Holding arguably THE biggest playing achievement record for the world's biggest club....  And Rooney's never even been my fave player ;-)"

reddevils,3d8p1n,Zico568,7,Tue Jul 14 13:15:53 2015 UTC,Because we likely aren't going to sign 2 CBs though after giving new contracts to Smalling and Jones as well.

That's why they were given renewals too and Evans isn't basically I think.   Of course those two would be good but LvG clearly sees the current crop as good enough with one new player and for that, he prefers Ramos maybe and Otamendi second choice.

reddevils,3d8p1n,Zico568,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:35:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think we should be chasing Ramos in the first place coz i don't believe he will come,Real don't want to lose him and he is their captain,it's a waste of time, because he has two years left in his contract while de gea has 1 year, so they can just wait for de gea to be a free agent next season then get him for FREE (unless de gea signs to get us some money) without selling us Ramos, simple. he will just get your hopes up for nothing!!"
reddevils,3d8p1n,IBENGM,3,Wed Jul 15 01:40:35 2015 UTC,"My old man is a Valencia supporter so I watched 20+ of their matches last season. Otamendi is really, really good. Definitely had a better season than Ramos, don't know if he's better than him overall, but last season alone he certainly was. I'd be happy with either, but we really need a world class centre back, not another -with all due respect as I think he's decent- Marcos Rojo."

reddevils,3d8p1n,Orcnick,16,Tue Jul 14 11:24:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that they would be open to this sort of negotiation. €50m is Otamendi's release clause, they don't need to sell him and seem perfectly happy to insist on fulfilment of the clause.  e: """"""""buyout clause"""""""""

It is not certain that Spanish clubs are legally obliged to release players to English teams should the buyout clause be met and it would also mean a significant amount of tax would have to be paid on the ""gift"" of €50m from United to Otamendi (as much as 50% of the fee itself).  What happens in many of these cases is that the clubs agree to sell for a fee approaching the buyout clause. That does not mean that the buyout clause has been activated.  What happens in many other cases is that the buyout clause is not the actual market value for the player and two clubs agree a fee significantly different to the amount in the clause."

reddevils,3d8p1n,Mu999,2,Tue Jul 14 11:28:55 2015 UTC,What's your logic on this? Was officially one of the best two central defenders in La Liga last year.
reddevils,3d8p1n,ChickenSun,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:27:53 2015 UTC,He wants to leave. He is apparently willing to force his way out. A club doesn't want an unhappy player. He isn't champions league proven. Also I don't think he suits the epl ie against tall powerful strikers. He isn't fantastic on the ball so van Gaal would much rather ramos.
reddevils,3d8p1n,Mu999,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:38:58 2015 UTC,Otamendi is pretty powerful and all action from what I understand so I don't get the argument that he wouldn't fit the league. I agree on his ability with the ball that's why he was second choice but it looks like Ramos isn't available. Yes he wants to leave but that doesn't mean he will go cheap look at Sterling. Valencia don't need to sell and they have him on a long contact.
reddevils,3d8p1n,ChickenSun,5,Wed Jul 15 10:16:55 2015 UTC,"35million quid? Hmmmmmm. Still, definitely cheaper than ramos. If Otmamendi's said he's not going back though, no way will Woody pay the full release clause."

I know I could never tell a pal ""I don't trust you/don't need you/you messed up etc"" in front of others because it would never feel right and would/could also be humiliating for them. But of course, maybe something happened before the incident with rvp and LvG that wasn't mentioned here so we can only speculate.  Even so, I personally feel as manager, he could and should have done it in a nicer way as it shows character too."
reddevils,3d9v98,Feezbull,13,Tue Jul 14 17:35:36 2015 UTC,Kinda funny now considering that some of us (myself included) felt LVG was biased towards RVP at times last season.
reddevils,3d9v98,ThatSnazzyGuy,4,Tue Jul 14 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"RVP had to play more than expected due to our early season injury crisis, when he really needed time to relax after a very busy summer. Falcao was out and Rooney was pushed to the midfield.  I think if the circumstances were better, we would have had a more rested van Persie and he would have had a more productive second half of the season because of more rest.

reddevils,3d9v98,HuzaifaElahi,2,Tue Jul 14 17:46:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't take a knowledge of man management to know it was a low blow on every account based on what we've read.   Which really stinks because he was a well loved player and they had a good relationship before. What would the other players have thought? Surely they'd have seen it as a cold move by the boss too and not felt good about it and some might even start to wonder if things could happen to them next. I mean, if those two who were close but still had it happen, what more players who haven't had a relationship with the manager previously?

reddevils,3d9v98,HuzaifaElahi,3,Tue Jul 14 18:00:08 2015 UTC,That makes it even worse actually. What's the need for it? It's not like it will convince other players of anything or like it was a disciplinary issue to show that nobody should escape it next time.   Ah well. Sour note nonetheless.

reddevils,3d9v98,FURyannnn,7,Tue Jul 14 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"Can anyone elaborate more on the falling out just before RVP left, or is all we know just what Mitten wrote in the article? If it's true, it's a shame he found out in a training session, just like how Rio was told in front of everyone that he was leaving while in the locker room around everyone."
reddevils,3d9v98,macAaronE,12,Tue Jul 14 17:12:14 2015 UTC,RVP confirmed in his press conference today that he trained by himself. Bit of a shame if it's gone that way.  edit: He also said he could see his departure coming for a while. He also said Ed Woodward was very classy and a true gentlemen for the way he handled the transfer.
reddevils,3d9v98,yiyiyiyi,12,Tue Jul 14 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"I may be a bit old school, but I think players should be brought in to the office and told by the manager that the club no longer sees the need for their services. I understand that there are always extenuating circumstances, but it's the right thing to do if we can do it. RVP being let go in front of everyone at training is like being broken up with at an outing with all of your friends present."
reddevils,3d9v98,macAaronE,7,Tue Jul 14 17:20:41 2015 UTC,"It seems, if what LvG did was indeed that way, that it was a very cold way to let him know- time to move on.   Very strange and disappointing form really especially as he made him the national team captain only a year ago or a little more and they seemed to work well together and shared similar ideas.   Makes his departure even more sad actually with that taken into account.   This is disappointing from Van Gaal and could definitely have been handled better. I'm not sure of rvp did anything to agitate the situation that resulted in this though but, it seems off anyway.   The fact that he thanked Woodward for the deal meant he likely accepted a cut price to facilitate this and rvp knew he didn't want to stay anymore really."
reddevils,3d9v98,Feezbull,4,Tue Jul 14 17:29:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely convinced by this, I think it was Robin's decision to leave, but it's not really that surprising if this is true. RvP and LvG did have some issues back in the national team. That's why I never took last season's whole RvP favoritism thing seriously, he dropped him in the past and wouldn't look twice if he had to drop him again, LvG is that kind of manager."
reddevils,3d9v98,ReaperX24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:05:59 2015 UTC,"What issues did they have back in the national team?   Maybe rvp wanted to leave indeed as he said he could see it coming. But still? No need to tell him in public that he's basically, not needed. Unless he said no, train on your own and it was because of a fitness thing as he felt he wasn't up to speed yet or so but that wasn't mentioned. Maybe it was the case but why would mitten leave it out intentionally then just to run a story of LvG making a cold move?"
reddevils,3d9v98,Feezbull,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:13:39 2015 UTC,What issues did they have back in the national team?   There is more but this is what I managed to find.
reddevils,3d9v98,ReaperX24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:27 2015 UTC,True shame that we didn't make better use of him over the last 2 seasons. Wish he could have had 3 full seasons under Fergie.  Apparently we watched him when he was 19 but never pulled the trigger!  Hope he does well in Turkey.

reddevils,3d8xkx,danmaher,5,Tue Jul 14 12:47:33 2015 UTC,That's what happens whenever big AMAs are done on /r/IAmA and not their respective subreddit. Same thing happens with certain musicians and actors and whatnot. All the general casual plebs get to ask the stupid bland questions and we all leave disappointed.
reddevils,3d8xkx,Isho,3,Tue Jul 14 12:47:19 2015 UTC,"Thought of that too, can the mods ""turn off the subscribe button"" as soon as they announce the AMA up until it's completed so that users from other clubs can't come in and ruin it all? Then only allow subscribed users to ask any questions? Please, excuse me if this is a stupid question."
reddevils,3d8xkx,Isho,7,Tue Jul 14 12:51:50 2015 UTC,"No I don't think that's possible. Though they can turn a subreddit private so only the subscribers of that sub can view and access the subreddit, but I doubt any footballer would only want to do an AMA to 32,000 subscribers (I bet there's only <10,000 active subscribers here out of that 32k) instead of millions on the big subs. /r/soccer would be a better choice than /r/IAmA. Plus there's no harm letting non-fans join along. Just that they do ask some very very generic questions."

Oregon and Alabama keep trying to one-up each other, and Ohio State, Oklahoma and Texas all have plans in the works that are hard not to call ridiculous.

reddevils,3dapib,aggressive_dolphin,40,Tue Jul 14 20:59:17 2015 UTC,Juve always make some of the best transfer business IMO.    Paul Pogba - FREE Sami Khedira - FREE Andrea Pirlo - FREE  Carlos Tevez - £6.3m Patrice Evra - £1m Vidal - £8.75m   Total: £16.05m - Outstanding business for the players mentioned
reddevils,3dapib,Rockypog,9,Tue Jul 14 21:33:26 2015 UTC,They used to happily shit away money a decade ago.
reddevils,3dapib,arron77,7,Tue Jul 14 21:37:36 2015 UTC,"But when they spent big, they spent right; look at Buffon - €51.6m seemed a stupendous amount at the time, especially for a goalkeeper, but he has been a servant to the club."
reddevils,3dapib,Rockypog,14,Tue Jul 14 21:43:00 2015 UTC,"Think he means €25m on Felipe Melo, €23m on Amauri, €16m on Matri type transfers. They wasted so much money on mediocrity after their relegation and were stuck in 7th spot in a fairly weak league."
reddevils,3dapib,inu50kza,56,Tue Jul 14 21:58:23 2015 UTC,Cabaye to Crystal Palace was impressive business.
reddevils,3dapib,Statedz,10,Tue Jul 14 20:44:47 2015 UTC,"In terms of impact, yeah. I wanted him here before he moved to PSG.  I think schweinsteiger for 10m (if that figure is true) is better business though. He's much better than Cabaye"
reddevils,3dapib,jammybear,15,Tue Jul 14 21:04:45 2015 UTC,But the fact it's Palace who bought him is what makes it impressive

reddevils,3dapib,Rept4r7,13,Tue Jul 14 20:42:48 2015 UTC,"I've seen a lot of hate for this transfer and the fee but they could reap huge rewards if they manage his development correctly.  First of all, QPR are entitled to a large % of the transfer free so that's always going to inflate the cost. Secondly, he's English.  All things considered this is a similar transfer to Wayne Rooney and we signed him at 19 when he was shagging grannies and temperamental as fuck.   Yes it could go tits up for City but if they nurture him and get 10 seasons out of him that fee will look like a great deal.   The kid has loads of potential and it's a shame that he was at Liverpool or else I'm sure we would have tried to sign him."
reddevils,3dapib,7evenStrings,4,Tue Jul 14 22:06:16 2015 UTC,"shushhhh we have to hate it because its City! Honestly I agree, he's got talent but if he's managed well he could be genuinely very good"
reddevils,3dapib,GarethGore,2,Tue Jul 14 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"Rooney was destroying teams at 17, please don't compare him to Sterling.   It's probably cliché to even say this now, but I think it's a more of a punt than even the media are making out. He's a small winger with dinosaur arms that can't finish, falls over alot and clearly rates himself.   As far as i'm concerned he could easily be the next Aaron Lennon or Sean Wright Phillips as he could be a top player for a decade. Just don't think he's that good. I hear people chucking the golden boy thing around - Messi had his ridiculous low center of gravity and dribbling, Rooney had his explosive strength and power, Pogba has this insane blend of physicality and skill - Sterling is..quite fast? He excels at nothing for me.   Tbh I think Liverpool did alright. They'll probably spend it on shit, but i'd rather have two £20m signings than Sterling."
reddevils,3dapib,frankowen18,6,Tue Jul 14 22:42:05 2015 UTC,"You haven't watched Sterling play at all, or you're delusional. It has to be one of those two because Sterling is already one of the best wingers in the league. He can dribble, he has a great eye for a pass, he is two-footed, scores goals, he's a complete player.  Describing him as a small boy who only runs fast is laughably biased."

I genuinely believe they're as good as Sterling, and have the same potential to make it as world class players in the future."
reddevils,3dapib,omegaxLoL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:03:24 2015 UTC,A bit hard to compare Depay since he was playing in a different league but for a second consider how much more we would have paid for Depay if he had nearly 100 premier league appearances at a top 6 club to his name.   Time will tell how Sterling turns out but I personally feel there is more chance of him succeeding than not. I really doubt he's going to be on the bench much. He'll play 30+ games next season for them.

Tielemans is 18 yet bizarrely feels like he's been around for a while, he excites me more. Varane, Pogba and Veratti are 22. Laporte 21.

reddevils,3dapib,GGMU1992,17,Tue Jul 14 20:49:32 2015 UTC,"Morgan Schneiderlein !! I've been tracking his progress for a while. He's a beast. He's best in class in terms of protecting the backline. Tackles and interceptions are unbelievable. Southampton had one of the best defensive records last year. I believe this man is the biggest reason. He passes ""to the correct shirt"". And plays accurate long balls too. Value for money will be even greater when he learns how to control tempo from Carrick and Basti. So far this is the best transfer of the summer. Thank you Woodward !!"

reddevils,3dapib,daniam1,3,Tue Jul 14 20:37:41 2015 UTC,"Not sure I agree there. It's not a bad purchase by any means, but if we're talking about the best value for money purchase, you can't say £14 million for a 34 year-old goal-keeper is that.  It's a good transfer, but great value rarely revolves around one of the least important positional groups in the game."

reddevils,3dapib,wh11,7,Tue Jul 14 21:49:40 2015 UTC,I think Boca Juniors getting Carlos Tevez back whilst he's been looking so dangerous recently is great for them!
reddevils,3dapib,Lost_And_NotFound,6,Tue Jul 14 21:00:19 2015 UTC,Payet to WHU. The guy wouldn't be out of place in our team. They've done some great business
reddevils,3dapib,TMillo,10,Tue Jul 14 21:51:49 2015 UTC,Value for money I'd say Milner to Liverpool.  Quality at a good price Cech and Schweinsteiger if it was for £10m
reddevils,3dapib,arron77,4,Tue Jul 14 20:47:28 2015 UTC,If we're talking value for money I won't consider Milner myself because of his wages. Apparently on more than Schweinsteiger.
reddevils,3dapib,TheJoshider10,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:51:13 2015 UTC,Cech is 34 though so that devalues the quality/price ratio by a fair bit. Still quality of course.

reddevils,3dapib,HuzaifaElahi,2,Tue Jul 14 22:08:49 2015 UTC,"Torn between Payet to West Ham, Cech to Arsenal, and Basti to us.  Payet was fantastic last season and fills a great need in West Ham's team.   Cech is a phenomenal goalkeeper, miles better than Szcznesy and Ospina, and while perhaps not being a key area to strengthen in Arsenal's team, he is one of those goalkeepers that can win you points.  Basti's going to be 31 by next season and has struggled with some injuries in the last seasons, that is true. But for £10 million, to get him playing under the manager that is literally responsible for his great impact as a CM, who knows how to use him better than pretty much every other manager, and to (hopefully) have our other midfielders (particularly Herrera and Schneiderlin) learn from such an incredible midfielder, it'll take something truly ridiculously awful for this deal to be seen as a bad piece of business during Basti's time with us."
reddevils,3dapib,omegaxLoL,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:01:31 2015 UTC,Easy. The lad Bastian Schweimsteiger from Bayern Munich to United. He plays in the midfield and will be a good signing. I'm sure the lads at Trafford will love him once they see him play a game or two
reddevils,3dapib,redUpDue93,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:49:21 2015 UTC,"Payet to west ham is a great transfer, could easily fit in at a bigger club.

reddevils,3d8doy,hdee804,158,Tue Jul 14 08:38:41 2015 UTC,"Don't want this to happen, I think Di Maria would have a good season, being able to attack easier now with a stronger midfield behind him.  That being said I 100% trust LVG and he's either got a very good replacement already agreed or in mind, or he's confident with the side he's got."
reddevils,3d8doy,SantagetoutClause,44,Tue Jul 14 08:56:46 2015 UTC,"I think this whole transfer window shows just how important it is to have a manager that demands trust.  If this was Moyes selling ADM we would be up in arms but the fact we have possibly the most experienced manager still working means he can sell world class players and we agree with him.  I'm also not too bothered as we have quite a lot of depth at ACM/AWM (attacking wide mid). I'd rather see ADM move on than loose Adnan or Pirera without giving them a fair crack of the whip, I think both those lads are as talented as anyone their age in Europe, we need to give them game time to show we want them.  There's also the fact that Mata playing wide (not his normal position, I know) linked up so well with Herrera gives me a lot of hope going into the new season."
reddevils,3d8doy,The_Second_Best,15,Tue Jul 14 09:12:51 2015 UTC,"I was thinking actually just after I posted my comment, imagine the reaction from fans of this was Moyes, we'd say he doesn't have a clue what he's doing. I agree that Adnan and Pirera need a chance, but Di Maria did show last season glimpses of what's he capable of, and he got some really important assists and goals last season. I'd like to see more of him."
reddevils,3d8doy,SantagetoutClause,6,Tue Jul 14 09:24:42 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong. I'd love to see what ADM could do with a solid defense behind him and a years experience in the Premier League but I think LVG just doesn't see him as a player that can play his style (lots of possession and patience, not taking the risky pass until it's needed).  If this transfer goes through the thing that will please me about it is how quickly it's happened. No drama, no infighting and hopefully plenty of time to reinvest the money into the squad."

reddevils,3d8doy,obadetona,18,Tue Jul 14 10:32:14 2015 UTC,"Well there's also the fact he got injured around November time, his first time in an English winter with no break, house getting broke into and the form of Ashley Young all combined to reduced play time."

reddevils,3d8doy,goodguy1994,2,Tue Jul 14 11:21:38 2015 UTC,"10 assists and 3 goals in just under 19 PL games    He didn't miss all the remaining games because of injury, or because someone with a bigger name than him took his spot. So the 'just 19 PL games' in fact tells people that he was not a good enough fit for LvG's system. It's not RM, where he had to fight for a spot against Bale. He came in to United as the person to beat to get a spot. And he lost. Simple as that.   He has his moments where he's out of the world, but the way he plays needs to fit with how LvG wants the team to play."
reddevils,3d8doy,Fres-Hunt,2,Tue Jul 14 12:59:59 2015 UTC,"IF he goes (I doubt that very much) it would be because HE wants to leave England. A change of scene. Family unsettled, whatever.

reddevils,3d8doy,TMillo,7,Tue Jul 14 08:53:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, I'm not entirely keen on Cavani either."
reddevils,3d8doy,InvertedPerv,21,Tue Jul 14 08:54:56 2015 UTC,"Assuming Di Maria leaves. Is there any top class winger on the market? Or Anyone with Di Maria level of ability? We won't get Ronaldo, Bale , Robben n all. Selling Di Maria to PSG for big money isn't the problem. The real problem is replacing him with some player with big reputation."
reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,8,Tue Jul 14 09:13:31 2015 UTC,"Muller, but he isn't going. It's mostly just highly rated youngsters like Felipe Anderson etc. I mean their is Griezmann but he's a LW, but could be converted to RW, cause LVG likes his inverted wingers. Maybe Shaqiri or Pedro? Bellarabi, Shaqiri, Reus?"
reddevils,3d8doy,InvertedPerv,7,Tue Jul 14 09:27:45 2015 UTC,"Muller - No way Griezmann - Oh, yes. That'd be lovely. Felipe Anderson - Good option but another unproven young winger as a starter? Reus - Class and Glass Shaqiri,Pedro , Bellarabi - Nah Nah"
reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,14,Tue Jul 14 09:32:48 2015 UTC,Griezmann would definitely be our best option if we sell him then.  There's nobody better than the options you mentioned and Muller tbh.
reddevils,3d8doy,wakey87433,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:41:33 2015 UTC,"Problem is we potentially have the same issue we have with ADM. What good is it swapping a player who atleast has had some time to adapt and you would hope comes back better prepared for one who very well may need 6-12months. Unless there is a chance of getting Bale or even a better Ronaldo I'm not sure I would get rid of AdM this summer in exchange for Griezmann, maybe bring in Griezmann now who can be blooded tactically as he adjusts and get rid of AdM next summer"
reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,2,Tue Jul 14 11:23:30 2015 UTC,"If Di Maria doesn't do well this season though we could be selling him next season for less than half of what we paid for him. I don't think Griezmann would be content on the bench either, or Di Maria if we had both. Griezmann is a great ST but Rooney is their, so it would be Di Maria/Mata/Griezmann and that just wouldn't be right imo."
reddevils,3d8doy,wakey87433,2,Tue Jul 14 11:28:49 2015 UTC,"Sure his value may drop but TBH if he contributed the same number of assists as he did this season then IMHO that would pay for any reduction in his value. The last thing we want though is to find us light in players who are ready to fill the role, I'm not expecting Depay to be amazing in the first 6 months (I would expect as you often see with foreign players who come in to hit the ground running in the first 3 or 4 weeks but then hit a bump for a few months), Adnan has much to learn yet as we saw last season and Peirera is raw so without AdM and Griezmann coming in it leaves us with Mata (who does a job out wide but isn't ideal), Young and Valencia who are adapted to the PL"
reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:43:01 2015 UTC,"Well Griezmann is basically a guaranteed starter for Atletico. So I don't see him joining unless Di Maria was sold tbh, he isn't going to dislodge Rooney at ST, and Mata played well on the right imo. He's got no reason to join and contend with 2 other amazing players for that position and not be a guaranteed starter."
reddevils,3d8doy,MorningFresh123,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:49:33 2015 UTC,Griezmann isn't a patch on Di Maria.

reddevils,3d8doy,wr712,4,Tue Jul 14 16:12:30 2015 UTC,Griezmann has played ST for the past 2 seasons. He is great at LW but is even more deadly at ST. Has a real eye for goals.

Who on the team is capable of getting on the same level as Fabregas with assists?  DI MARIA.  This will fuck it all up.
reddevils,3d8doy,Fres-Hunt,28,Tue Jul 14 15:10:43 2015 UTC,"I'll just paste my opinion, which I wrote on the LIVE transfer thread, here:    I feel it would be stupid of us to let Di Maria go after spending a fortune, and giving him just one season in the PL. In the beginning, van Gaal said during Di Maria's announcement that he'll come good, but the fans have to be patient. So, I don't think he's the forcing him out in my opinion. To me, it seems like Di Maria is the one who's willing to leave, but then I don't understand the point of the interview he gave a couple weeks back regarding staying at United and fighting for a starting spot. It's all rather confusing, and in any case, if he really wants to leave...it shouldn't be for any less than what the club actually paid him for (around 60m pounds)."
reddevils,3d8doy,_WhatIsReal_,7,Tue Jul 14 08:40:45 2015 UTC,"don't understand the point of the interview he gave a couple weeks back    Say he wants to stay here -> United get bigger fee for AdM -> Jorge Mendes' cut is bigger as agent fees. Mendes will want him to answer in particular ways if it benefits him/his client, if it isn't detrimental to his client's career. That's what is happening here. PSG or any club will not hold it against him if says he loves his old club before transferring.   Moreover, remember the shitstorm that ensued last year when he said publicly that RM wasn't giving him a hike and he wasn't happy? It turns the fanbase against you, which is not always good."
reddevils,3d8doy,mufctez,6,Tue Jul 14 13:07:14 2015 UTC,"This is what i think also. People are saying LVG knows best and if he doesnt fit he should go, but i think in reality if DiMa leaves it will be because he is unhappy here and wants to bottle it after just one season. If we sell him now and for any less than what we paid for him it makes the club look kind of stupid and i will be pretty fucking disappointed."

reddevils,3d8doy,Dryhtscipe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:43:22 2015 UTC,"All them liars! I understand they probably don't want to upset the fans by directly admitting about their intentions, but they could at least be diplomatic about it, couldn't they?   They could stall instead of saying they want to be here next season, and then exits the door when given the slightest of opportunity."
reddevils,3d8doy,Kambei1311,7,Tue Jul 14 08:47:53 2015 UTC,"He, out of choice, wrote a huge thing about being part of United history and coming back stronger etc.  I understand he could say 'I am looking forward to the next season with Man United' then just leave, but what's the point of the theatrics and pretend passion if he was just gonna leave?"
reddevils,3d8doy,Shinobius,3,Tue Jul 14 08:52:22 2015 UTC,"And if the plan then wasn't to leave?  I don't get why people seem to forget so easily that things change. Often, pretty fast."
reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,2,Tue Jul 14 10:35:44 2015 UTC,"I feel it would be stupid of us to let Di Maria go after spending a fortune   This isn't a sensible approach to transfers. Continuing to invest time and money on a player in the vague hope that they eventually pan out isn't intelligent decision making.  Di Maria never justified a £60 million price tag, and that would have been the same even if he had taken like a duck to water in our squad and had a good season. Instead, he rode the bench and was comfortably supplanted by Ashley Young.  I think Di Maria will go this season. We've locked out our midfield with Schweinsteiger and Schneiderlin, and we've added a further dimension to the left-wing with Memphis Depay. It's difficult to imagine where Di Maria now fits in.  The fortunate thing is that Di Maria is still on a fat contract, and he's still 'only' 27 years old. For a club like PSG, he easily justifies whatever inflated fee they're willing to stump up for him. I think the best thing we could do is recoup as much money as possible from his transfer and look to reinvest it elsewhere this summer.  I'd much rather take the money from an unmotivated misfit if it meant that we could secure an elite talent in a position of need."
reddevils,3d8doy,Shinobius,25,Tue Jul 14 12:05:02 2015 UTC,I honestly think all this speculation is coming from PSG who're still sore from the fact they couldn't get him last year.   Di María has indicated he wants to stay and fight for his place and it'll be unlikely that Van Gaal decides to discard him after a year especially after he said he wanted him last year when he specifically said we didn't have wingers of the calibre of Di María and Ronaldo.  I can see this one happening only if he wants to leave and if they pay more than the £59.7 we paid. Otherwise it makes no sense at all.
reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,7,Tue Jul 14 09:50:58 2015 UTC,"Considering they paid £50m for Luiz, I expect them to at least pay what we paid."
reddevils,3d8doy,DangoManUtd,6,Tue Jul 14 10:01:41 2015 UTC,They can spend what they like because FFP has been eased. I don't think we should sell for anything less than £65-70 million simply because they can pay up. He's a quality player and we have no obligation to sell.
reddevils,3d8doy,DaveIsMe,2,Tue Jul 14 10:08:18 2015 UTC,"That is true, but I think they won't go higher than £60m, considering the season he's just had and he's a year older. If we take a £5m loss then I'm fine with that I guess."
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,13,Tue Jul 14 10:11:52 2015 UTC,I will get Marco Reus instead ..
reddevils,3d8doy,DaveIsMe,12,Tue Jul 14 10:24:10 2015 UTC,"I feel like if we're signing him Woodward's going to want someone big coming in (since he has such a boner for the way Real Madrid do business).  I just hope it isn't Cavani, because that'll feel like a letdown. Although if we were buying Cavani from Napoli days I'd be loving it, so maybe it'll work out."
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,3,Tue Jul 14 09:06:30 2015 UTC,"Cavani is still very good, for some reason people think he's a bottler, the guy is a workhorse and a decent finisher. But him coming to us is being reported by the English media, there is no mention of him to us as a part of a deal in Le Parisien. So I wouldn't believe the Cavani rumours just yet."
reddevils,3d8doy,frankowen18,9,Tue Jul 14 09:11:50 2015 UTC,I think if he isn't having a great time at PSG because Ibra plays in the position he'd want to play in why come to a club whose captain plays that position. I think we'd be unlikely to see the best of him if he came here.
reddevils,3d8doy,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:20:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that Ibra rumour was a while back I think, again I think he's class but don't think he's going to be a part of a deal with AdM or he is going to come to United."
reddevils,3d8doy,DerpyNerdy,3,Tue Jul 14 09:23:37 2015 UTC,"Didn't he miss the most clear cut chances in Europes top 5 leagues or something. I don't want him, older, expensive and not all that good."
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,11,Tue Jul 14 11:14:40 2015 UTC,Depends how he's replaced. Wouldn't see sell him unless we can get Griezmann/Reus/Bale personally.   EDIT: Spelling
reddevils,3d8doy,gleek_master,3,Tue Jul 14 09:35:25 2015 UTC,"Not saying a replacement is not needed, but we still have the most improved player of the year Ashley Young.. Peeps here are kinda quick to forget that and I wouldn't be too worried..  What we really really need is a goal machine and rock solid CB..  If there's time for a Maria replacement, I'm all for it but I think there are more important positions to fill.."
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,17,Tue Jul 14 12:58:51 2015 UTC,This page is highly reliable.
reddevils,3d8doy,Hassi94,10,Tue Jul 14 08:46:46 2015 UTC,Yep don't understand the downvotes to this. They aren't BBC but are pretty damn reliable when it comes to French news.
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,7,Tue Jul 14 09:24:55 2015 UTC,"I guess it's news that people wouldn't want to hear, I like this page and whenever there is a French player moving, I check these guys. Payet to West Ham, Ayew to Swansea all were reported by these guys way before English media got on it. Same with Morgan, and they have been on this AdM thing for a while now."
reddevils,3d8doy,Hassi94,4,Tue Jul 14 09:38:52 2015 UTC,Are you being sarcastic or...?
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,13,Tue Jul 14 08:52:38 2015 UTC,"No, this page is really reliable for Fench players, then French league. Reported Schneidy to United long long back. And the guy who said ADM to PSG hasn't gotten a story wrong in 12 months apparently. United fans have been dismissing this story for a while, I believe there a high chance this is true and if the United board don't see him fit, I reckon he'll be gone."
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,4,Tue Jul 14 08:56:11 2015 UTC,It'll be a huge shame IMO. Are we looking to sign a marquee player to replace him? Perhaps Cavani...
reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,5,Tue Jul 14 08:59:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, Cavani to United is being talked about, but that is by the English media, so I wouldn't be too confident that is true, but we need a world class 'consistent' right sided winger. Also about ADM the guy is world class no doubt about it, but he has his ups and his lows, his lows are way below par for him to succeed at United, if he doesn't perform LVG won't play him, we saw that last season coupled with his wife being unhappy at Manchester, the break in at his house, being kept out of team, I don't think he fancies PL. Listen, I want him to stay and be world class for us, but if his mind is not on it, then it's better he leaves.  Also Le Parisien are so confident he is gone, that they think he will be on their US tour, and we face them in a couple of days, will be real interesting how this progresses."
reddevils,3d8doy,Feezbull,11,Tue Jul 14 09:04:05 2015 UTC,"Don't understand the point about him joining PSG on their tour, considering he's resting (and also injured) after Copa America."
reddevils,3d8doy,Hassi94,2,Tue Jul 14 09:08:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's just shows how confident there are, but I believe that Di Maria wants to leave and PSG are willing to pay at least 50 million pounds for him. I don't know if we are willing to sell him though, but their media thinks we are. If we are listening to offers, this deal might go through."
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,5,Tue Jul 14 09:29:37 2015 UTC,"Not sure why they think he'll be on their tour if he goes, he's out for a few more weeks at least."
reddevils,3d8doy,Jonnythebull,9,Tue Jul 14 09:08:51 2015 UTC,Which questions the credibility of the article yet again.
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,2,Tue Jul 14 09:14:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't know if Cavani is a realistic rumour but it makes sense. Also, agree we probably still need a top class winger.   The last part is suspect though, it doesn't make sense that he'll be on PSG's tour given he has a recent hamstring injury and is on holiday anyway."

reddevils,3d8doy,MAINEiac4434,3,Tue Jul 14 09:21:43 2015 UTC,"Fuck.  What happened to the United that used to give players a chance? Seems ridiculously harsh if it turns out to be true. As someone said above he got 10 assists and 3 goals in just under 19 PL games, in his first season, in a new country, on what was bad form for his standards and with injuries stopping him getting a good run of form....  In LVG we trust and all but I wasn't happy to see RVP go and definitely wouldn't be if we let Di Maria go already."
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:54:02 2015 UTC,"It's just rumours, but I wouldn't dismiss them the other fans have. We will have to wait and see, I guess."

reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,6,Tue Jul 14 15:21:34 2015 UTC,I don't even know anymore.
reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,4,Tue Jul 14 08:44:50 2015 UTC,"Just can't stand those journalists. And here's why: Not so long ago, David de Gea was their main focus. He will leave, he will sign in next 24 hours, he will this, he will that... Now, when that story died (at least for now), their focus is turning on this one fella, who was brought in for large sum of money, had very bad season, for his standards and oh, he wants to leave, he wants to go back to home (Argentina? Spain?) and he will sign for PSG (France o.O).  I honestly think that Di Maria is professional who is well aware of what is expected from him and who wants to prove that everyone can have bad season, specially when you come to league where is played very different style of football than you are used to.   I think Di Maria will be our player for many years to come."
reddevils,3d8doy,sunshinelov1n,3,Tue Jul 14 09:24:38 2015 UTC,What's the reported fee? Anything under £50m should be responded to with a burst of laugh.
reddevils,3d8doy,Nakabg,3,Tue Jul 14 09:14:37 2015 UTC,"60m Euros, so it's going to be around 47-48m pounds."
reddevils,3d8doy,ikilledasalesman,3,Tue Jul 14 09:17:29 2015 UTC,Round about £43m :\

reddevils,3d8doy,StannisJr,3,Tue Jul 14 13:46:43 2015 UTC,"Agree completely. If playing alongside and learning from someone like Bastian isn't attractive, then by all means he should leave."
reddevils,3d8doy,jamieandhisego,2,Tue Jul 14 14:16:33 2015 UTC,"Yep, I absolutely agree. I just don't understand why he would want to go to PSG, it blows my mind. His family not liking Manchester is the only valid reason I can see."
reddevils,3d8doy,GGMU2014,11,Tue Jul 14 14:46:11 2015 UTC,He never wanted to be a United player in the first place so farewell. It's a shame that he's not willing to fight though.  Hopefully LVG focuses on either Griezmann or Reus now.
reddevils,3d8doy,jesusinarillo,2,Tue Jul 14 09:26:04 2015 UTC,This. His head was at psg but the move couldnt go through. Id rather have someone who wanted to be in the club like Memphis.

On his day, Di Maria is one of the best players in the world, and we should be looking to utilise his undoubted talents.  Also, Cavani is also one of the worst 'elite' footballers I can ever remember watching, although I will throw my support fully behind him if he does sign."

reddevils,3d8doy,rdzzl,3,Tue Jul 14 10:17:56 2015 UTC,I pray this isn't true but I think it is. LVG has his philosophy and I don't think it suits ADM well at all. ADM wants to run around the pitch like a mad man but LVG wants him to stay in his position.

Rooney won't be around forever and he could easily be the face of a GIGANTIC club if he plays at his highest level week in and out .  PSG no matter how much they spend will be on United's level in terms of prestige.  If he thinks he and his family will be more happy in Paris and he doesn't screw the club let than let him go and get someone who wants to be here.  Personally if United could swap him to Bayern for Müller or Lewandowski I would take it.

reddevils,3d8doy,as520,2,Tue Jul 14 14:44:30 2015 UTC,Let me ask a more important question; Is Le Parisien worth trusting?
reddevils,3d8doy,arron77,2,Tue Jul 14 15:38:57 2015 UTC,It would be beyond asinine to sell him after just one season. Even Veron got two to prove himself. Not to mention he's shown flashes of brilliance.
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,2,Tue Jul 14 14:55:06 2015 UTC,But he said it himself that he doesn't want to leave and is looking forward to another season at United.
reddevils,3d8doy,AC5L4T3R,2,Tue Jul 14 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"As the furthermost player in a 3 man midfield he offers something different and it's his best role, it's like having an extra winger on the pitch who works hard and tries to make things happen at pace. I want him to stay and be used there. If we're gonna use him LW/RW, he's as effective as Nani with fewer goals. We would be losing someone with massive big game experience also."
reddevils,3d8doy,as520,3,Tue Jul 14 15:24:43 2015 UTC,"PSG can fuck right off, Di Maria has a lot to give. one season plagued with injuries cant be enough to get rid of him, theres a reason we paid that much for him, its just gotta pay off for us now."
reddevils,3d8doy,Kambei1311,3,Tue Jul 14 18:07:44 2015 UTC,So Depay will wear number 7
reddevils,3d8doy,mink_man,3,Tue Jul 14 11:21:29 2015 UTC,"He's a year older, he hasn't adapted well, and there have been rumours of him being unhappy in Manchester.  If PSG are willing to pay close to our valuation, then I wouldn't be devastated if it were to happen.  At no point last season did he look like a player who would live up to his price.  If we can reinvest the money in someone who can tear apart the right side, then it might be for the best, especially considering the midfield we have today.  Hand the #7 to Memphis and let history repeat itself"
reddevils,3d8doy,markob53,10,Tue Jul 14 13:15:00 2015 UTC,"If we sell him, I really hope we can unsettle Bale then, there's not much talent that can ""tear apart"" the right side right now."
reddevils,3d8doy,mink_man,4,Tue Jul 14 08:54:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I reaaaally don't want to go into the season with an ageing Young and Valencia, the promising but very raw Memphis and Adnan, and an out of position Mata as our only wing options."

reddevils,3d8doy,welbzy,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:53:32 2015 UTC,We should buy a world class or on the verge of being a world class right sided winger.   Di Maria is a world class right sided winger. Just cause he had one poor season after moving country and teams doesn't make him average now.
reddevils,3d8doy,GGMU1992,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:55:32 2015 UTC,"Who said he was average? I don't want him sold, I believe he wants to leave, PSG are interested and if Le Perisian and RMC reports are to be believed, we are willingly to look at offers for him. Also, if you've watched Di Maria before at Madrid in the space of three years, his best season and most world class season came as a left sided midfielder."
reddevils,3d8doy,daniam1,2,Tue Jul 14 11:30:48 2015 UTC,"Totally agree with this. No time for sentiment or more ""could be"" and ""should be"".  Cut our losses while Di Maria has still significant value in the transfer market, look to reinvest the money elsewhere.  Worst thing we could do is let his disappointing career in a United shirt drag on until he's well past his prime and worth essentially nothing."
reddevils,3d8doy,Iamsexyandiknowit,8,Tue Jul 14 11:38:39 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind tbh. He's not a world class winger. World class CM alright when given space and the freedom. Doesn't really suit our possession based style at all. I think there might be legs to this.
reddevils,3d8doy,Calimariae,20,Tue Jul 14 12:09:35 2015 UTC,"He is both a world class winger and world class CM, him and Depay are the two best wingers we have and it's not like ADM won't get games in CM.  Yes he was poor last season but if people are still judging players after one season then i really do despair, especially as he's lit up Europe for years before that."
reddevils,3d8doy,GolDeScholes,2,Tue Jul 14 08:45:26 2015 UTC,Depays best position is on the left. ADM has never played well on the right. He was always inconsistent as a winger. If he was on the LW for Madrid in his last season I am 100% sure we wouldn't be buying him for 59m.
reddevils,3d8doy,reginalduk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 09:53:06 2015 UTC,"True, but players adapted to the LvG system, and some are still trying hard to adapt. But, give up on him after just one season? Which was no doubt a bad one, and he still managed to get loads of assists (probably 3rd highest in the league if I remember correctly)."
reddevils,3d8doy,kangas08,3,Tue Jul 14 11:08:23 2015 UTC,"Imo he has never impressed me on the wing. The season with madrid he was insane, because he was in CM.  He came to us, started in CM and again was insane. Then he went to the left and was poor.   Some players don't suit a system. Think of it this way, would he suit Barca?  I think ADM has great feet but his close control lacks. Compare to Robben where he always looks in control. ADM is a lively, off the cuff type player. If we lost 5m I'd take it."

reddevils,3d8doy,dimberb,3,Tue Jul 14 11:45:39 2015 UTC,The only player I would want from them is Veratti and even then I don't want him THAT badly. The only player I would substitute Di Maria for in the world is Griezmann (realistically)

reddevils,3d8doy,TY1901,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:06:54 2015 UTC,I guess if he goes this means that Januzaj and Depay will get a lot of games out on the wing which will be excellent. Even though our midfield is stacked I would still take verratti and I would happily take marquinhos but I expect were gonna get stuck with Cavani :(

Too risky on the ball for CM, doesn't really work as an out-and-out winger   I'd say that there's a high possibility that he is at least tempted by moving to Paris."
reddevils,3d8doy,breuh,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:10:38 2015 UTC,On one hand I really want to see another season from him to see if he can find his stride. On the other hand hes 27 and if we can recoup what we got for him and spend it elsewhere that's not bad either.

They print a ludicrous article for the club, and in return the journalist is fed accurate info down the line, which is why some of these guys seem so hit or miss. Basically they're not as concerned about what you or I think of the writing, only of what their sources think."

reddevils,3d8tuq,_ar76,3,Tue Jul 14 12:11:16 2015 UTC,"Forward's agent admits player's next move will be to either England or Spain but that Bayern would need a ""very high"" offer before considering selling  Manchester United face a bill of at least €50 million (£35m) to prise Robert Lewandowski from Bayern Munich.  United manager Louis van Gaal has identified the Pole as his favoured option to bolster the club’s attacking options following the exits of Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie since the end of last season.  With Bastian Schweinsteiger leaving Bayern in a £15m move to Old Trafford this week, Van Gaal accepts that persuading the German champions to sell another leading player will prove hugely difficult.  Lewandowski, 26, has spent just one year at the Allianz Arena following his free transfer arrival from Borussia Dortmund last summer.  And although the player is happy at Bayern, Lewandowski’s representative, Cezary Kucharski, has admitted that the striker’s next move will be to either England or Spain.  Speaking on Polish television, Kucharski said, “I think it would have to be a very high offer, definitely higher than €50m (for Bayern to consider selling.)  “Robert is one of the most valued strikers on the market who guarantees goals, guarantees assists, excitement. He has shown that over many years during his career.  “Every year he is an even better player and plays at a higher level and that is very important for other clubs because he has credibility and guarantees at least 30 goals a season.  “With a player of Robert's class, the truth is that not a lot of work is required because really there are only two directions in which he could go in the future, England or Spain, and only with Bayern Munich's acceptance.”  Former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson enquired about Lewandowski during his time at Dortmund before instead signing Van Persie from Arsenal.  Lewandowski instead waited to seal a Bosman move to Bayern and Kucharski admits that the player is in no rush to leave Munich.  “There must be a signal from the club, from Munich,” Kucharski said. “There is no such signal so we are not thinking about it, because even thinking about a change of club would be unfair in my opinion to the current employers.  “There is no reason, apart from money to be honest, to even think about it.  “Bayern would have to think about why they would get rid of Robert Lewandowski? It seems to me that there is no reason to even think about it.”"

""Even only thinking about a transfer would be disrespectful to his employer"" ""To be honest, apart from maybe money, there is no reason to think about a transfer anyway""  Interview with Rummenigge:  ""Bastian was a special case""  ""I can reassure our fans that we will not sell another player to Manchester"""

Whereas Schneiderlin seemingly more suited to the deeper, carrick, role as opposed to the number 8 role.   Regardless who plays deeper two of Schweinsteiger, Schneiderlin and Carrick will be such improvement to our midfield next season. Can't wait to see them play together!"

He was forced to use a 3-5-2 at the world cup because of Strootman's injury (which he actually confirmed).  When he joins us he specifically says the ideal formation that fits his philosophy tends to be a 4-3-3, but we don't have the players for it. We change to it at the end of the season and have great success with it, playing the best football we've played all season.  I just honestly can't see us moving back to it."

reddevils,3dfuuc,lifeisabech,3,Thu Jul 16 01:31:06 2015 UTC,"The only team he played 343 with, had to do with the players he had and the way he can utilise them in the best way possible. Turned out to be the way of Totaal Voetbal as we call it here in Holland (Total Football)."
reddevils,3dfuuc,Appztract,2,Thu Jul 16 02:01:33 2015 UTC,"If you look at the signings he is undoubtedly going for a 433, or a 4231 if you ask me. We played 352 due to the lack of squad balance, and the fact we had RVP, Rooney and Falcao in the team so we kinda needed the 2 up front and 442 is not a great formation for possession generally.  Right now we have 1 top striker in Rooney, and a midfield selection that's perfect for a 433. Plus it's the system we had the most success with last season despite a bad run when we lost some players to injury and what not."
reddevils,3dfuuc,TangoApple,2,Wed Jul 15 23:14:30 2015 UTC,"He isn't a fan of 352, he only plays it when it is necessary. His go to formation is and always will be 433, with a nr10, this is typical in the Dutch football philosophy."

reddevils,3d8v8k,blackbeard97,5,Tue Jul 14 13:09:33 2015 UTC,"Manchester United defender Rafael wants to move to Italy this summer, his agent has confirmed.  The Brazilian’s future at Old Trafford looks bleak following the arrival of Matteo Darmian and was left out of the squad for the pre-season tour to the US.  Cassiano Pereira told Tutto Mercato: “His contract expires in June 2016 and the coach, Van Gaal, said he isn’t counting on him, so the player wants to leave and we are talking with more than one club about this.  “Roma would be a more than welcome destination  “We would be more than happy to talk to the capital club. Italy would be a great opportunity, particularly as he has a Portuguese passport.  “We are in contact with several clubs, but I can’t reveal them.  “If Fiorentina call us, we’ll be very happy to talk. The player is very interested in playing in Italy.”"
reddevils,3d8v8k,Isho,11,Tue Jul 14 12:22:31 2015 UTC,"This sucks. Really hoping he stays with us but if he's been told he has no future with us then I wish him all the best for the future. He's still only 25 and if he can overcome all these injuries he still has a very bright future ahead of him. Whichever team he goes to will get a superb player who will give it his all for the team. Going to follow Rafa wherever he goes next, he'll always be a red devil to me."
reddevils,3d8v8k,Feezbull,2,Tue Jul 14 12:29:42 2015 UTC,They will only get a superb player if he stays fit. That's been his issue. He can be the reincarnation of Cafu and Maldini but it's no use if he's not able to play enough games.   He would go for a measly fee I'm sure so it would help his cause to join a good club for now with a low risk in that sense. But he seriously needs to stay fit to resurrect his career.   No way he would stay after being told he's not in the plans and essentially a backup's backup now.   Sad this happened to such a player who clearly loves the club and also has ability to be a great player. But some players are just injured more than not unfortunately.   Good luck to him.
reddevils,3d8v8k,7evenStrings,5,Tue Jul 14 12:41:54 2015 UTC,Weird that there isn't more demand for him. I think a lot of clubs could do something with him despite his injuries. I don't think his salary demands would be too high either. Going by what we sold Buttner for last year hopefully we can get 6-8 million for him.
reddevils,3d8v8k,addictedsc2,2,Tue Jul 14 12:51:07 2015 UTC,"Good luck to him. I always rated him, shame he had so many injuries. He can still tear up Seria A if he stays fit though."

Nothing to gain by bringing him. Give others a chance.   There was a time when overseas matches came about and big players wouldn't even be brought or if they did go they wouldn't play.

reddevils,3d83f8,SpeedyOwnt,2,Tue Jul 14 06:32:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's going to be real interesting to see where we go from here if DDG stays. Real Madrid have to buy a goalkeeper now, so if they don't get DDG now, i'd guess they don't want him next year. What does DDG do then? Does he leave (presumably pissed at Utd for ruining his shot at being RM #1), or does he sign a new deal, sine it'd probably be his best option then? Not a lot of teams in Utds category will be looking for GK's next year.  Of the top of my head these teams will not:  Barca, RM, Arsenal, Chelsea, City, Bayern"

And this past year it was the Dutch national manager, but with Di Maria & Falcao (who both signed for a lot of $$$) there was no way United wouldn't start them to get their money's worth out of them. That hurt his confidence a lot more. And when Falcao wasn't up to snuff & Di Maria got hurt, he obviously wasn't the same.

reddevils,3d88oy,rdzzl,5,Tue Jul 14 16:59:00 2015 UTC,"I think what you're saying makes sense - and I'm taking 'young players' to mean 'young, first team, players'. Youth systems take longer to overhaul, but when Shaw et al are being told things by LvG and his staff, they only need to look up and see Basti to see where listening can take you (especially as his position change is so well documented and attributed to LvG).  On another note, cheers for taking the time to write your thoughts up, always nice to see posts like this :)"
reddevils,3d88oy,taylajy,4,Tue Jul 14 07:44:44 2015 UTC,"Onto the main point of this post: I believe that the signing of Bastian Schweinsteiger will create a new class of youth products rising up to the first team. While we have strayed from this in recent years (di Maria, Mata, van Persie), it is in the club's culture and no doubt has been one of the goals given to van Gaal by the board.   The problem, as I see it, is that I can not remember a pre-season in which we've brought fewer youth prospects than this one. We have signed a lot of top class players, which can make the journey to a spot on the bench/first team for our youth players even longer.   With Schweinsteiger's signing, youth players will now be able to see before their eyes a product of a young player who listened, learned, and practised intensely under van Gaal's tutelage in Bayern Munich: a vice-captain of a World Cup winning team, a widely renowned world-class player with a trophy list almost half as long as Ryan Giggs'. To see an actual end result of work being put in ahead of time will, I think, motivate them greatly. It also helps that they have had a full year to settle into new systems and tactics.   I don't doubt that these signings can have a great psychological effect on our youth  players. In Gary Neville's RED, he describes in detail how much the youth players looked up to the profiled first team players. Schweinsteiger surely falls into this category.   Perhaps some of these young players have lost a bit of confidence after seeing signing after signing come in. But if they can take Bastian Schweinsteiger as an example, imagine what they can do in the future.   While it should be motivating to see this, remember that Bayern during Van Gaal was a team without too many profiles. Lahm, Ribery, Robben, Van Bommel and perhaps Klose at the time. Lots of young players coming through with the help of LVG. Compare that to what we've got at the moment, and it is a very different case. While I think and hope LvG can produce similar results for us with regards to youth development, I think our transfer strategy has been extreme in comparison to what happened at Bayern at the time, so it is hard to see how he'll reproduce the same results for us at the moment. Hopefully we'll see at least Wilson and McNair come through, and perhaps Pereira or Adnan too. But with our transfers in, I think it'll be difficult for a few of them to get games. Hopefully we'll progress in the league and FA cup so we can match them there. That said, I am really disappointed in the list of players going on pre season. Very disappointed.  That said, I guess I'll reserve my judgement until September 1st. Perhaps we'll see some profiles let go as well. If not, I hope to see some of our most prominent youth players loaned out to ensure them game time. Adnan is not good enough to knick Mata, Di Maria or Depay's position yet, Pereira is not going to get a spot in the midfield over Schweinsteiger, Carrick, Blind, Herrera, Schneiderlin, Fellaini yet and so on. At least with the signings we're making, anything less than trophies this season will be a massive disappointment. I fully expect us to win one, and legitimately challenge for the others until the end. We sure are in for a hell of a ride."

They were lucky that Fergie was able to consistently win trophies without spending big and any potential worries were put to bed by SAF's brilliance. Since then we've spent money but it's money the club has generated itself, hardly like they've been digging into their own pockets. They really aren't arsed about the supporters either although since Woodward has come in he seems like he is trying to bridge the gap a bit with match going fans."

Paper costs are actually an asset as they are a tax shield. The savings on Goodwill (When you buy a company the value of the company is the assets value but you pay for more than that so the price gets inflated. You are able to write some of this extra paid  every year in the accounts and its called Goodwill) have saved almost £100mill in tax. There have been other Paper costs also that over the 10 years have saved significant amounts of tax.   As for the equivalents payments the PLC would have had to make, the main thing is dividends. The benefit of Interest payments over Dividends is again the tax shield it provides. Dividends are paid after tax so is money going out of the clubs accounts. Interest payments are a costs so are taken before tax so actually reduce tax liability thus saving some money. Obviously Dividends don't need to be paid but are expected if a profit is made and United had paid a dividend every year. Infact in all but 2 years they paid the standard dividend and a Special Dividend on top of that which basically doubled the dividend payment. How much the dividend payment actually would have been each year can't really be said because it relies on a few factors not least how much of the revenue growth the PLC could have made that the Glazers did. Evidence suggests while some of it would have happened it wouldn't have been close to what the Glazers achieved because they had been choosing to leave money on the table and even when Chelsea got their money they hadn't shown any sign of responding by aggressively growing revenue to allow us to compete with Chelsea money.  My estimation however is that ultimately haven't actually costs us a significant more even if we assume the PLC matched their revenues  and most likely we have had more money in to spend on players  even in the years Fergie was in charge than we would have as the PLC. It just seems more Fergie choose not to which is backed up by the fact for 3 seasons we had £140mill sitting in a bank account while interest rates were basically zero that went untouched, even incompetent businessmen don't do that. We had big bids confirmed in a number of those windows where the player choose elsewhere (Either sugar daddy wages, wages being something that is dictated not by available money but by keeping a safe Revenue/wage ratio of 50%  or Spanish weather and the lower tax rates they enjoyed until the last few years)"
reddevils,3db7da,wakey87433,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:35:33 2015 UTC,blame also lies with the FA for allowing clubs to be purchased on credit regulatory conditions are their business also being purchased outright and taken off the stock market was always a risk of floating.
reddevils,3db7da,mynjo,11,Tue Jul 14 23:28:50 2015 UTC,"they had/have a long-term plan when it came to debt restructuring and capitalisation... the uproar stemmed from: fans distrust of some Americans, lack of faith in the global economy as it would affect revenue and thus spending, and fear that the Glazer's past actions in their other sports enterprises would be transferred to the club (NFL-ization).  the fact of the matter is that just about every move they've made (or didn't make in some respects) has yielded a positive result for the club. imo, this was deffo a case of xenophobia and anxiety of losing the soul of the club."
reddevils,3db7da,cheersdom,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:23:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah. This is obviously a real unpopular opinion. But i tend to agree. They are not idiots. They know a team has to be successful in the field for the business to succeed and vice versa. Obviously the way they loaded the club with debt will forever be remembered. But our financials are now going strength to strength. no one will ever know if this was due to the families business acumen or would of happened anyway but has to be credited to them as it stands. An example i think of them not being all that bad is with the naming rights. Lets face it, old Trafford would sell out every week even if it was named go daddy arena. But the idea had never been floated, at least not publicly.  Mike Ashley was happy to do it and he supposedly is a fan of his club. This is my 2 cents worth anyway."

Even now that we're spending more money (although generating more money through more and more sponsorships - cheers Ed), there's barely any contact with the supporters, and we have lost a gigantic amount of money paying off loans for them.

But at the moment I have no overwhelming objections, the club is definitely poorer than it could have been but conversely I also think we have more revenue under them (thanks to Ed) than we would have otherwise (despite increases in TV money).   They seemed to let SAF do his thing, including appointing Moyes and now that Malcolm is gone they seem to have loosened the purse strings (maybe he didn't want to spend the inheritance, or he was just tight).   Time will still tell though..."

We've always had a huge fan-base, but the Glazers brought in the business savvy needed to take advantage it. The reason we can now go out in the transfer market and spend 300 mil in 2 years, regardless of ffp, is because the club had to put a great deal of emphasis on making money to finance the Glazer's debt. Basically, in the short-run it was bad, but in the long-run it may be the best thing that could've happened to us."

reddevils,3d86ik,shredderrrrrr,2,Tue Jul 14 09:24:25 2015 UTC,"I have been to two United practice sessions during their preseason tours and I must say, I have had absolutely different experiences. The first was fucking awesome. I was really young and barely remember, but I remember enjoying it more than the actual game!  When United played Barca in DC a few years ago, my wife, my parents, and I decided to travel from Iowa to go to the game. My parents surprised my wife and I with VIP tickets that included the practice session. To return the favor, I found someone selling tickets for the practice for $50 each and bought them for my parents (a lot for a kid in college at the time). Holy fuck was it a waste of money.   The team circled the field jogging to warm up and then did a shooting drill and keep-away (if that's what you call it) before stretching and leaving. The problem? They did all shooting on one goal and all stretching and keep-away in one corner of the field. For fans on that end, it must have been great! For the unfortunate people like me who were in the opposite corner, I could hardly see a thing. I kept waiting for them to move to the other side (or at least split into groups and disperse around the field like they did the first time I saw them train), but nope. Their warm-up lap of the field was the only glimpse of them I got.   After writing this, I suppose I don't know why I did--it doesn't answer your question. I guess it is to say don't feel bad if you can't make it to the training session (if they have one)!"
reddevils,3d86ik,AutumnWindz,2,Tue Jul 14 16:42:22 2015 UTC,"Haha, thanks for writing it out and sharing - was fun to read even though unfortunately some of your experience may not have been that fun at the time! The second session you saw sounded like what a lot of teams do for pre-game warmups that you can see if you get to the stadium a bit early, honestly.  I play a lot so I'm not only necessarily interested in chasing them as stars, the aspect of seeing how they go about their profession is also really interesting to me; everything from what they wear, to the equipment they use, to the routines they drill on, and little bits of skill they might flash on the training field... It's really fun to see them going about their job outside of actual matches!"
reddevils,3d86ik,shredderrrrrr,2,Tue Jul 14 19:28:18 2015 UTC,That makes sense! I think that is why I enjoyed the first practice session so much--there was something so mesmerizing about seeing the skill they displayed doing one-touch keepaway. I remember finding it interesting how some players were having fun with it while others would get livid when they gave the ball away and had to go in the middle.   It's a side of the game you rarely otherwise get to see at the top level! Even if you do have to watch the training session with binoculars.

reddevils,3d4c74,chook79,2,Mon Jul 13 12:46:22 2015 UTC,That's the reason I always play with the reds.  Schweinsteiger is a red...
reddevils,3d4c74,xtfftc,3,Mon Jul 13 13:16:11 2015 UTC,yep
reddevils,3d4c74,ijd17,71,Mon Jul 13 12:44:56 2015 UTC,"Manchester United is delighted to announce that Bastian Schweinsteiger has completed his transfer from Bayern Munich. Bastian joins on a three-year contract.  Bastian Schweinsteiger said: ""I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Bayern Munich, it has been an incredible journey and I didn’t take the decision to leave lightly. Manchester United is the only club that I would have left Munich for. I feel ready for this new and exciting challenge in what I regard as the most competitive league in the world and I am looking forward to working with Louis van Gaal again.  ""I will never forget my time at Bayern Munich and I would like to thank everyone at the club and the fans for the great memories.""  Louis van Gaal said: ""Bastian is, of course, no stranger to me. I worked with him during my time at Bayern Munich and I am truly delighted he is joining Manchester United. His record speaks for itself; he has won every honour at club level and was a major part of the successful Germany World Cup-winning team last summer.   ""Bastian is the ultimate professional and there is no doubting his talent and his ability to control games. He brings a wealth of experience and is an excellent addition to our squad."""
reddevils,3d4c74,jimmyjammaay,21,Mon Jul 13 12:34:10 2015 UTC,"Control games- as if it was of any doubt, but that basically confirms he's carrick's replacement/rotation for those who didn't realise.   Schneiderlin isn't the number 6 yet. Maybe in a few years but for now, he's not replacing Carrick while Schweinsteiger does a box to box role in this day and age he has. His tenacity (Morgan) and pressing ability also perfectly suit the box to box role in LVG's system as well so it's a waste for him to play as Carrick's replacement.   Will he be that guy next time? Maybe in future once he learns how to dictate the tempo and develops his vision even more but he needs time for that to happen anyway and maybe he might even not transition there if he's developed his game to own that box to box role. But I can see him move there as he gets older to preserve his legs and he loses the pressing ability or fitness."
reddevils,3d4c74,Feezbull,3,Mon Jul 13 12:44:07 2015 UTC,"For sure agree he's to rotate with or replace Carrick. When you consider our final stretch of games where we struggled while Carrick was injured, this transfer provides another strong and experienced option to fill that role."

reddevils,3d8z4j,StaleMilkNothingTher,12,Tue Jul 14 12:58:30 2015 UTC,"This is something I posted after last year's transfer window when everyone was saying we were losing our 'identity':  With the sales of Welbeck and Cleverley there has been a lot of talk of how United have lost their identity, their philosophy of nurturing youth and not spending big. But to anyone with any knowledge of the history of this club, this is complete and obvious hogwash.  When Fergie took on management of the club he inherited a first team with serious deficiencies. Players getting old, with drinking problems, injury prone and in some cases just not Championship winning quality. Furthermore (despite the presence of career saving Mark Robins), the club was producing no quality talent out of the acadamy.  How did he remedy this situation? In two ways. He tore down the acadamy and started it from scratch, taking a keen personal interest in how it worked. And he spent. A lot. BIG BIG money. Breaking transfer records and completely revamping the team with the acquisition of established/rising talent.  Just look at United's 92/93 and 93/94 title winning team:  Schmeichel Irwin Pallister Bruce Parker Giggs/Sharpe Keane Ince Kanchelskis Hughes Cantona   In winning his first two titles Fergie only had two positions covered by acadamy players (LW - Giggs and ST - Hughes [who was rebought from Barcelona]). It wasn't until 95/96, when Hughes, Kanchelskis and Ince had been moved on after a horrible 94/95, that Fergie gave youth a chance (knowing full well the huge talents coming out of the clas of '92).  LvG is finding himself in a similar situation. A first team in need of drastic overhall and an acadamy just not producing as well as it should. He's spending big big money to establish that basis of success and behind the scenes I am sure he is doing everything to improve the quality of our acadamy (based on the legacies he left at his other clubs).  tl;dr: First and foremost, United is about success. About being the best team in the country and playing attractive football in the process. Then, and only then, do we promote youth.  tl:dr part deux: the 90's; I was there man"

reddevils,3dfs2a,AMak10,18,Wed Jul 15 22:58:46 2015 UTC,Nah don't be. For example: De Vrij didn't know any Italian when he moved to Lazio but he's been their best player. Darmian knows a little + I'm sure the Spanish players can help him a little even though Spanish/Italian is not exactly the same
reddevils,3dfs2a,therosepetal,2,Wed Jul 15 22:46:48 2015 UTC,If the Spaniards speak slowly then Darmian should be able to work out the gist of what is being said.
reddevils,3dfs2a,maniacaldentist,19,Wed Jul 15 22:51:12 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Spaniards speaking slowly is a sign of the apocalypse. Every Spanish person I've ever met speaks at 10000000 miles an hour

reddevils,3dfs2a,FISH_MASTER,15,Wed Jul 15 23:08:32 2015 UTC,His English was better in the 1on1 interview. It's different when you're speaking in front of a crowd and everyone is looking at you.   Obviously he needs to improve it because there is a communication issue but it's probably nothing to worry about.

Besides, he might actually know more English than he's shown during the pressers."

I'd like to add that at torino he played alongside glik (polish) and maksimovic (serbian). It will be more difficult to be the outsider, but it won't be a new situation for him. Also I don't think he has a gf or family so he won't just get to go home and speak all the italian he wants. Hopefully all goes well, I don't see why it can't."

In my opinion every Premier League club should have either a channel (the big clubs) or an online streaming service (big and small clubs) for fans to watch games that won't be broadcasted on TV.  The 3pm rule is there due to the worry people will watch big games instead of going to lower league ones, but I highly doubt someones gonna want to pay 7 quid a month to watch club specific games.   I wish this was possible. Every fan should be able to watch their own club play whenever it's not on Sky or BT via the clubs own channel or streaming service. I'd happily pay for HD quality shit but ah well, if shit won't change then streaming it is. Hope streaming gets more and more popular and TV packages get less subscribers."

It detracts from the point you're trying to get across and I gave up reading because of it. There's nothing wrong with expressing your views in a simple manner, it opens up you're audience and often makes your point more effective. It just seems here that you've used a thesaurus on every other word to try and show how smart you are.  I'm sure you had some good points, I just have no idea what they are."

reddevils,3dg1rb,bluntdude24_psn,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:33:23 2015 UTC,"Aunque no tengo ninguna crítica de documentos sonoros de Valdés, tengo algunas observaciones y comentarios para compartir. Aunque no sin superposición y la simplificación, tengo la intención de identificar las tres posiciones principales en empresas de Valdés. Reconozco que no he contabilizado todos los puntos de vista posibles dentro de los parámetros de estas tres posiciones. Sin embargo, Valdés ansía más poder. Yo digo que deberíamos darle más potencia preferentemente, 10.000 voltios de la misma. Debemos promover el intercambio libre y abierto de ideas y puntos de vista. Si fallamos en esto, no estamos fallando otra persona; no estamos interrumpiendo algún interés separado de nosotros mismos. Más bien, somos nosotros los que sufren cuando descuidamos observar que Valdés proclama en cada oportunidad que nunca había implicado ni goad a otros a participar en actos ilegales. La organización protesta demasiado, me parece. Nuestro camino está establecido. Por esto, quiero decir que a fin de iluminar la mente del hombre y lo mejora como ser racional, moral y social, debemos tomar acción personal y purgar la oscuridad de su corazón. Considero que el requisito de un pequeño precio a pagar porque Valdés ha logrado convencer a una gran variedad de personas que debemos emitidos nuestros lotes con, meatheads atolondrados bulliciosos. Eso es sólo una prueba más de que lo más insidioso en el mundo es absurdo que suena bastante plausible escuchar. Es el tipo de tonterías que impide que la gente al ver que una línea de falla centro corre a través de cada uno de humillaciones de Valdes. En concreto, de vez en cuando verás Valdés lamento, azotar a sí mismo, llorar mea culpa por la promoción de su sustituto natural de la moral, que define como polyloquent cualquier intento de discutir acerca de sus travesuras, y juran no volver a ser tan regañona. Lamentablemente, siempre vuelve a su antiguo comportamiento inmediatamente después, me hace pensar que si se va a alterar, modificar, abreviar, y censurar el registro a señalar con el dedo de la responsabilidad a los demás, entonces al menos debe tener el respeto de sí mismo para recordar a sí mismo de un par de cosas: En primer lugar, me parece sus maquinaciones altamente insultante. Y en segundo lugar, sus lickspittles mala reputación han sido marginando las tradiciones y verdades sobre las que se asienta la grandeza de nuestra nación. Debe haber justicia y restitución para esto, y los que son responsables de tal comportamiento desagradable debe rendir cuentas. Le sugiero que comencemos creando puentes entre las personas marginadas y luego extensiones hacia afuera para grupos más amplios. Si lo hace, al menos, demostrar que si Valdés tuvo su manera, las escuelas se enseñará a los estudiantes que la vida humana es prescindible. Esto no es educación, sino el adoctrinamiento. Evita que los estudiantes de aprender acerca de cómo Valdés sigue diciendo que su pandilla es una colonia del cielo llamado a obedecer a Dios al forzar su código moral sobre el resto de nosotros. Esta es la carga más estereotipada, inmadura, poco imaginativo, por los números de tonterías de segunda mano que he oído nunca. La verdad es que nada une a la gente como un enemigo común. Es por eso que me gustaría animar a todos a tomar algunas fotos de su cuenta en Valdés por reprender por evadir la responsabilidad. Usted puede haber notado que los co-conspiradores de Valdés son incapaces de tomar una causa célebre de la exposición de las doctrinas de Valdés por lo que realmente son. Son incapaces de hacer que por la misma razón que los tigres son incapaces de convertirse en vegetarianos: Está en su sangre. Es su propia naturaleza para negar rotundamente que Valdés con frecuencia acusa a sus rivales de la formulación de políticas sociales y programas de acción basado en los tipos más irresponsables de solipsismo en existencia. Este es un ejemplo más de la creciente falta de civilidad en nuestro discurso civil que va desde la oficiosa a la hemorragia del corazón e incluso lascivo. En un debate más adecuado, se podría en cambio cortésmente señalar que algunas personas piensan que es un extremo poco de mí para eliminar a organizaciones como Valdés que han engañado, traicionado, y nosotros, un poco por encima explotados, tal vez. Bueno, lo que debo recordar a estas personas es que me gustaría dar un ejemplo de cómo puede ser brusco Valdés. Valdés ha admitido que tiene la intención de preparar el terreno para una campaña cada vez más cruel y brutal de terror. Vale, puede que haya sido un ejemplo particularmente calvo con cara y poco sutil, pero no puedo comprometer con Valdés; es sin principios. No puedo razonar con él; es sin razón. Pero puedo advertir a ella y con una advertencia que debo sin duda tomar en serio: Valdés nunca ha ciertamente dado pruebas de pensar ampliamente. O en absoluto, para el caso. Ahora, para algunos consejo de despedida: Mira los hechos. Analizar los argumentos. Piense acerca de las motivaciones de las personas que te están diciendo que Valdés se puede confiar para juzgar el resto del mundo desde una posición única de sabiduría pura. Y tener confianza en ti mismo. Recuerde, repugnante, fefnicutes tendenciosas ajustan sus opiniones acerca de lo que está bien y lo que está mal con su percepción de opiniones y el comportamiento de Valdés."

reddevils,3d86xf,jimmyjammaay,25,Tue Jul 14 07:07:36 2015 UTC,Maybe van Gaal knows his quality. That's either a good thing or a bad thing.
reddevils,3d86xf,rKO13,7,Tue Jul 14 07:14:14 2015 UTC,"Well, last season's tour we had 4 gk's. And most people rate Valdes pretty higher than Lindegaard and Johnstone, so it's kind of worrying when Valdes isn't on tour. Maybe he hasn't fully recovered from his injury or his injury has prevented him from being the GK he once was? Just seems odd."
reddevils,3d86xf,StannisJr,3,Tue Jul 14 07:16:43 2015 UTC,"Not suited for the league unfortunately, glad we aren't risking it, I'd rather sign a big physical keeper than keep Valdes even if it is against the philosophy. We'll leak more goals through dropped crosses etc than a keeper who won't play with his feet"

Its funny how I'm down voted for not writing a detailed reply whereas someone who just says ""Valdes is good enough"" would get up voted. I'm tempted to write a post and put in video evidence of Valdes from his whole career being physically weak to not be good enough in the air, even in the Spanish league."
reddevils,3d86xf,kw9403,2,Tue Jul 14 14:49:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's true, I questioned his physicality in a previous post. It's going to be interesting then who we get as a backup to De Gea/ and possibly a De Gea replacement also. Unless we stick with Lindegaard then for backup."

reddevils,3d4dli,Schneidsteiger,10,Mon Jul 13 14:38:45 2015 UTC,"You know we have a good central midfield situation when you don't even mention Blind, Fellaini, Mata, and Di Maria (though I'm assuming you weren't considering Mata and ADM as CMs).  I mean, just think about it. We have two full rotations of world class central mids. One day we could play Herrera in front of Scweinsteiger and Schneiderlin and the next day we could play Mata in front of Carrick and Blind. Then considering we can rotate Depay/Young/Januzaj on the left and ADM/Valencia on the right? Fucking incredible if you ask me.   We just need an experienced CB (and maybe a backup ST if available) and we're fucking set."
reddevils,3d4dli,shredderrrrrr,3,Mon Jul 13 15:55:27 2015 UTC,"For the backup striker, I wonder if LVG will start with his plan to play Januzaj in that position?"
reddevils,3d4dli,tothecatmobile,3,Mon Jul 13 16:53:32 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to see. I'd honestly be surprised--I really can't see Januzaj as a striker.   Now that I think about it, I think we might be alright for now at ST. Rooney will obviously always be first choice, but if he can't play, we can always throw Fellaini up there if we don't want to use Chicharito (if he stays) or Wilson."
reddevils,3d4dli,shredderrrrrr,2,Mon Jul 13 17:22:54 2015 UTC,"He could be more of a number 10 striker than a number 9.  Much like how Van Persie moved from the wing after Bergkamp left Arsenal, perhaps Januzaj will follow a similar path."
reddevils,3d4dli,tothecatmobile,3,Mon Jul 13 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"Funniest part of that is that Fergie played Gibson and O'Shea in midfield against Arsenal, of all teams, with the da Silva Twins on the wings. And won the match 2-0."

reddevils,3d4dli,El_Giganto,8,Mon Jul 13 14:25:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know why he has been so overlooked this year. I thought he has played very well. He's obviously not the best in the world and has room for improvement, but he is certainly United quality. I think his likely new role is about where he should be at United--a good second choice/squad rotation player."

reddevils,3d4dli,shredderrrrrr,2,Mon Jul 13 17:28:23 2015 UTC,"No idea why he was so overlooked. He was solid. Had a knee sprain, if memory serves, and didn't miss significant time. He was solid. Didn't do anything spectacularly but made a difference. Hard worker and scored some big goals late in games. Also versatile in that he can play LB and CDM serviceably."
reddevils,3d4dli,osorojotx,7,Mon Jul 13 16:51:23 2015 UTC,"He reminds me of Carrick in that sense. For years, he was not given much credit. Why? Because he did exactly what a holding mid is supposed to do--go unnoticed! Holding mids should merely be providing a link for the team, not scoring or directly setting up 20 goals a year. If you constantly notice a holding mid, it likely means they're doing something wrong (like giving the ball away a lot) or playing out of position."

Morgan joins on a four-year contract with the option to extend for a further year.    Morgan Schneiderlin said: ""I am delighted to be a Manchester United player. Once I learned that United were interested in signing me, it was a very easy decision to make. I have enjoyed seven very happy years with Southampton and it’s a club that will always be in my heart. But the chance to be part of this squad to help this great club be successful was too good to miss.  ""I’m excited to be starting that journey on our trip to the USA. I know what Manchester United means to fans all over the world and I’m looking forward to experiencing that.""  Louis van Gaal said: ""Morgan is a very talented player with great energy and ability. His skills will complement the players that we already have and I am very pleased that we have been able to complete this deal before the tour to the United States. That training camp will be very important in our preparations for the new season and gives Morgan and the other players a chance to show our fans what they can achieve together."""

reddevils,3d4dli,benitin,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:11:43 2015 UTC,3 signings and a Mcgregor Brown win
reddevils,3d4dli,khabibnurmy,17,Mon Jul 13 15:51:06 2015 UTC,I'm still absolutely blown away by how quickly these two signings have happened before the tour. Makes me very confident that we will do all the deals we need to do by the end of the window.
reddevils,3d4dli,RICK_DORGON,6,Mon Jul 13 12:47:32 2015 UTC,"The only thing I'm worried about now is that LVG said he wanted his new signings in before the tour... So is that it? I would have liked a central defender locked up for sure, but perhaps we're just sticking with what we have? (Rojo, Smalling, Jones) However I'd guess that we'd sign a striker nearer the end of the transfer window, ala Falcao last year."
reddevils,3d4dli,craigybacha,4,Mon Jul 13 13:19:49 2015 UTC,"We definitely have enough players to play CB (Rojo, Smalling, Jones, Evans, McNair, and Blackett), but the problem I have is that none of them are consistently top class. Could we scrape by with them? Sure. But I would have zero confidence playing a top side like Barca with any two of those six playing.   If we could bring in one veteran defender like Ramos, it would do us worlds of good. That way he could shore up and lead our young defense successfully for a few seasons while the younger CBs grow and develop."
reddevils,3d4dli,shredderrrrrr,2,Mon Jul 13 16:01:04 2015 UTC,"This is exactly what I am thinking as well. We could scrape by fine, but in the Premier League and Champions League one mistake can cost you the title/trophy... and all of our centre backs have the potential to make mistakes (despite also being pretty decent generally). So it's a case of if we're going for titles, we need that leader at the back."
reddevils,3d4dli,craigybacha,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:37:27 2015 UTC,Exactly! That's why I would love an older player like Ramos. We don't need the next Ferdinand who will be a star for the next decade. We have plenty of young players who very well may develop into phenomenal players. What we need is some immediate reliability and leadership. I'll be curious to see what LVG does!

reddevils,3d4dli,shredderrrrrr,2,Mon Jul 13 16:03:10 2015 UTC,"Shaw and Darmian don't look too bad either. Wilson kind of delivers on the ST front. and DDG in goal is as good as it gets, if he stays."

reddevils,3d4dli,thearidion,2,Mon Jul 13 13:08:27 2015 UTC,"Well this almost completely eliminates the possibility of Di Maria going back to LCM, which means Di Maria will get pushed upwards to play RW. So I see Mata getting benched."
reddevils,3d4dli,nickooj,3,Mon Jul 13 13:41:28 2015 UTC,Mata performed so much better than Di Maria last year. He could be a huge power sub though
reddevils,3d4dli,thearidion,2,Mon Jul 13 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"He did. But realistically speaking, are we going to bench Di Maria from the start of the season? I expect him to return to the starting lineup once he returns from injury/Copa America break."
reddevils,3d4dli,nickooj,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:08:20 2015 UTC,They took turns playing well it seems. DiMaria in the first half and Mata in the second half. I don't think anyone can argue that DiMaria has much more potential to do well though.
reddevils,3d4dli,grad14uc,2,Mon Jul 13 17:33:12 2015 UTC,Like I said he would be a great super sub

reddevils,3d4dli,ixora7,2,Mon Jul 13 14:00:29 2015 UTC,what about depay?
reddevils,3d4dli,IBENGM,2,Mon Jul 13 14:15:09 2015 UTC,Depay probably won't be a starter immediately since he's new and young. Would probably be on rotation with Mata and ADM.

reddevils,3d4dli,IBENGM,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:27:04 2015 UTC,"Since LVG hinted Depay could be a forward, I wouldn't be surprised to see a 4-3-3 with Mata on the right coming inside behind Rooney and Memphis (like the dynamic 2 up top he played with RVP/ Robben (+Memphis).  Or ADM on the left with Mata on the right. Or rotating mata off the bench with ADM on the right and Memphis on the left. We have many many options now."

No matter how much a player wants to play for LvG, the honest fact is that Ed has to do the deal (and apparently do about 4-5 at a time), make sure we have the funds, make sure we find buyers for players we don't want (make space in the team), etc, etc.  For the rest of the season most of us will be talking about LvG or players or even the backroom staff so, at least for now, we'll devote this summer to ol' Ed. #godward4ever"

He's a good backup and very useful when we may need to employ a strategy with a no.10 in certain situations but he's just not suited to a 433 anywhere unless it's a double pivot 4231 type 433 which Van Gaal isnt' going for imo.
reddevils,3dacf5,RedDevil237025,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:55:13 2015 UTC,"I agree he's not a ""true winger"". He's not beating a fullback for pace. Unless your name is Moreno (pass from Herrera).

reddevils,3dacf5,uncreddevil,2,Tue Jul 14 19:07:58 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  We would be diong the right thing by picking him up and solve our ""problem"" of being short a Striker.  He could also be the immediate successor to Wazza and decrease pressure on Wilson to perform immediately, but rather allow Wilson to develop and create a chain of impressive strikers.  His pace is undeniably phenomenal and would improve our team greatly."
reddevils,3dacf5,MylesVE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:57:59 2015 UTC,"I see your point, but disagree. He isn't what we need. Wilson has had games and deserves his chance behind Rooney. Let's not forget that LvG likes that pressure you were speaking of. Helps him separate the wheat from the chaff; getting the best from the best."
reddevils,3dacf5,HuzaifaElahi,2,Tue Jul 14 20:22:55 2015 UTC,"Wilson has had games and deserves his chance behind Rooney.   This is Wilson, not Icardi or Berardi, we can't challenge with somone as inexperienced as him as our 2nd striker if we want to win titles. I'm all for giving him time but lets not act like we have some proven elite talent in Wilson because, quite frankly, he's shown nothing of that sort in his limited opportunities (few do at his age but the point remains). I'd back Chicha as our 2nd striker to definitely perform more reliably than Wilson next season."
reddevils,3dacf5,MylesVE,2,Tue Jul 14 20:35:19 2015 UTC,"Given the gap of experience between them it's hard to compare, but I'd rather have Wilson over Drogba. Over Balotelli too. Over Adabayore. Over Ricky Lambert. And LVG must've rated him over Welbeck (still hurts, I liked Danny tremendously).  Point is, if Kane never got his run he wouldn't be the player he is now. Can't predict what lies ahead for Wilson, but I like him. I like him way more than paying 40 some odd mil for a player we kinda/sorta need."
reddevils,3dacf5,HuzaifaElahi,3,Tue Jul 14 20:44:46 2015 UTC,"Chelsea have a proven Premier League scorer in Remy as 2nd choice, Drogba is 3rd choice.   It's futile comparing the rest when Wilson is totally unproven at Premier League level and Welbeck was gone because he wanted to and was 4th choice behind strikers we thought we're world class at the start of the season.  I refuse to consider Griezmann as a striker for our needs because he isn't one, no one said pay 45 Million for him to play 2nd fiddle to Rooney but make no mistake, a striker is a requirement, not a ""kinda/sorta"" player we may need.  Rooney injured and we're fucked striker wise and disturbing Depay from the left wing isn't preferable.  We need a Benteke type player at least to be on the bench but is definitely capable when called upon and is proven to be able to knock goals when in a top league.  Benteke at least, if not a top talent like Icardi to not only rotate with Rooney but also be good enough to take over as Wayne declines further - I'm sorry but trusting Wilson to be that player is very premature for a top club that wants to win titles."
reddevils,3dacf5,MylesVE,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:52:16 2015 UTC,"Notice I referenced a player and not a position. A quality CF to play behind Rooney is nice. We will not go for Benteke, and he will not want to play second fiddle. At his age he will want to play every game. Drogba may of been 3rd but played as 2nd choice due to Remy's injuries. I do not personally rate Icardi. Though he is more cost efficient than either Benteke or Greizman.   Lacazette, for me, ticks all those boxes. Inexpensive comparatively, fast as hell, age is on his side, and he would be willing to play limited games and fight for starts. I envision Saha before all those injuries."
reddevils,3dacf5,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:53:32 2015 UTC,"Lacazette is the dream striker, completely agree on that front. Disappointing we haven't been linked at all."

reddevils,3dacf5,yuuske69,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:07:40 2015 UTC,Seriously Griezmann is such a great player. His versatility would be be greatly welcomed considering we need a winger and a back up striker. He could start on the wing and play striker if it is needed.

Especially we have our own French and German connection for them to be able to get comfortable into the team. Because I honestly believe we need that pace and threat to the right especially if we'll have Depay to the left."
reddevils,3dacf5,yuuske69,3,Tue Jul 14 19:24:20 2015 UTC,"Reus would be my dream. I would prefer lacazette over greizman, though."
reddevils,3dacf5,itsalexdean,3,Tue Jul 14 20:24:42 2015 UTC,Me too. Reus in a Manchester United jersey would be awesome.
reddevils,3dacf5,ReflectingGod,2,Tue Jul 14 20:27:21 2015 UTC,"They've already sold one of their star players in Arda Turan, i HIGHLY doubt they will be getting rid of another one. Not sure what his release clause is."
reddevils,3dacf5,HuzaifaElahi,6,Tue Jul 14 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"£43m is whats reported for his buyout clause which I don't think is an awful lot in the scheme of things. He bagged plenty of goals in last season and is really versatile. At 24 years old I think that seems a fair price, very similar to Aguero's fee several years back."
reddevils,3dacf5,kw9403,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:13 2015 UTC,somewhere in the 40s I think but the guy is absolute quality with age on his side.
reddevils,3dacf5,prehighcrap,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:15:34 2015 UTC,less than Di Maria I think
reddevils,3dacf5,Hassi94,4,Tue Jul 14 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"If it means to bring Morgan's smile back, summon ed!   Serious: think we'll have to overpay to get him since he is their top scorer and just signed last summer, question is will he reach adm's level?"
reddevils,3dacf5,prehighcrap,2,Tue Jul 14 19:16:13 2015 UTC,£43m release clause. It's a lot but if Di Maria was to leave for £50m+...
reddevils,3dacf5,Hassi94,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:20:25 2015 UTC,But do you see him reaching dimaria's level? I can see him being a long term target but the fee is...
reddevils,3dacf5,GarethGore,6,Tue Jul 14 19:30:28 2015 UTC,"He is 3 years younger than Di Maria and I think if we're planning on playing them at RW, he'll do a better job than Di Maria. Di Maria doesn't like cutting in, he plays better on the left hand side and best in CM. He is a goal provider, he doesn't score goals so playing on the right makes little sense.  Now Griezmann doesn't play on the right either, been playing at LW mostly until this year where Simeone has been converting him to a striker. He is a goalscorer though, so you'd think he'd be able to play RW wing (he's left footed).  I'm not going to claim £43m is a 'steal' or anything, but if Di Maria doesn't want to be here, he should leave. And if he leaves, we need a top quality winger to replace him and I think Griezmann is one of very few possibilities that would be a good signing."
reddevils,3dacf5,bloo2004,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:45:01 2015 UTC,"Well we're stacked on CM which is Di Maria's best position. We play Di Maria as a winger, a position in which he usually does not impress. Getting Griezmann and playing him on the wing would probably be an improvement. Imagine the goals from a Depay-Rooney-Griezmann front 3."
reddevils,3dacf5,SanJoseNativetil,2,Tue Jul 14 22:27:55 2015 UTC,"If DiMa does leave I think the two possible players I'd like are Griezmann or Reus. Griezmann has got good stats for the last season playing as a striker, I think its like 21 apps and 15 goals as a striker which is good."

reddevils,3dacf5,JimmyDuckShoes,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:22:45 2015 UTC,"As I said on another thread swapping a player with a year of adjustment under their belt for one who may very well have to go through that same year of adjustment just doesn't make sense to me.  I would wait and see personally how AdM does this season, even if he doesn't do much better but provides the same assists he did this season it should offset any loss in resale value it causes.  Only way I would get rid of AdM and bring in another player to take his place is if it was someone with proven PL experience such as Bale or Ronaldo because I just don't feel too many of our wingers would otherwise be in their adjustment period or their skills are more in the work rate field rather than being an amazing attacking threat"
reddevils,3dacf5,HuzaifaElahi,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:15:52 2015 UTC,You want to pay £30m+ for a player and then try to convert him to a new position?
reddevils,3dacf5,ReflectingGod,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:44:42 2015 UTC,He's a left winger converted to striker. The difference between left and right wing is not that great especially since he could cut in from the right and shoot with his left foot. Most of the best wingers in the world are inverted wingers.
reddevils,3dacf5,HuzaifaElahi,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:25:57 2015 UTC,What about Pedro? We could probably lure him here instead of Chelsea...

Unless they do it for domains but even then a DM article will be less reliable than a Ian Ladyman one.  It'd be nice to have tiers in the sidebar during off-season though

reddevils,3d6301,jimmyjammaay,73,Mon Jul 13 20:30:20 2015 UTC,"Fucking hell, everything about this deal is getting better with each day."
reddevils,3d6301,omegaxLoL,44,Mon Jul 13 20:33:43 2015 UTC,"Q: The fee for Schweinsteiger has been reported as €20 million. Was it really that high?  A: No, it wasn't. It's a nice, round sum that looks good on paper. Bayern didn't want to sell too cheaply, for fear of appearing as if they're dumping one of their talismans; and Manchester United are quite happy for it to be bandied about, for the opposite reason. The actual fee is much closer to €15 million."
reddevils,3d6301,Zandercy42,13,Mon Jul 13 20:32:07 2015 UTC,Why would we be happy that people think we spent more? Wouldn't that make it seem like we're not good at negotiating prices?
reddevils,3d6301,iAmRealCarlosDanger,13,Mon Jul 13 21:41:16 2015 UTC,It also means that we are signaling to potential and current partners that we are not afraid to spend money and we will go above and beyond other clubs to spend what we need to get the best players in the world to play for us. And that is a club that every potential partner would like to be a associated with. The amount that other clubs/sources  misquote/quote within the bounds of reason could never be harmful imho.

reddevils,3d6ngm,d0mth0ma5,78,Tue Jul 14 22:48:22 2015 UTC,"Bastian Schweinsteiger (Official):   Bastian Schweinsteiger: ""I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Bayern Munich, it has been an incredible journey and I didn’t take the decision to leave lightly. Manchester United is the only club that I would have left Munich for. I feel ready for this new and exciting challenge in what I regard as the most competitive league in the world and I am looking forward to working with Louis van Gaal again. I will never forget my time at Bayern Munich and I would like to thank everyone at the club and the fans for the great memories."" Louis van Gaal: ""Bastian is, of course, no stranger to me. I worked with him during my time at Bayern Munich and I am truly delighted he is joining Manchester United. His record speaks for itself; he has won every honour at club level and was a major part of the successful Germany World Cup-winning team last summer. Bastian is the ultimate professional and there is no doubting his talent and his ability to control games. He brings a wealth of experience and is an excellent addition to our squad."" The transfer fee was £10.7m (€15m), and not £14.4m (€20m) like previously reported. [Raphael Honigstein]     Morgan Schneiderlin (Official):   Morgan Schneiderlin: ""I am delighted to be a Manchester United player. Once I learned that United were interested in signing me, it was a very easy decision to make. I have enjoyed seven very happy years with Southampton and it’s a club that will always be in my heart. But the chance to be part of this squad to help this great club be successful was too good to miss. ""I’m excited to be starting that journey on our trip to the USA. I know what Manchester United means to fans all over the world and I’m looking forward to experiencing that."" Louis van Gaal: ""Morgan is a very talented player with great energy and ability. His skills will complement the players that we already have and I am very pleased that we have been able to complete this deal before the tour to the United States. That training camp will be very important in our preparations for the new season and gives Morgan and the other players a chance to show our fans what they can achieve together."" The transfer fee was £24m (€33.8m). [BBC, Sky Sports]     Angel Di Maria:   Di Maria and his wife are unhappy in Manchester and are keen to return to Spain. [Telegraph’s Mark Ogden] Philipp Lahm on Di Maria: ""I don't know if he is a candidate. I don't know where he will go to or if he will stay. He costs a huge amount of money. There are so many factors like salary and whatever. There are many other people in our club who know more about that topic than me."" [Goal]     David de Gea:   Manchester United have not received a bid for De Gea from Real Madrid. [Sky Sports] Florentino Pérez: “De Gea is a magnificent goalkeeper but he belongs to Manchester United.” Real Madrid are beginning to accept the possibility that De Gea will not join them this summer. Manchester United’s stubbornness is holding back the transfer. De Gea is prepared to “endure” being at United for one more year and then leave for free. [Marca] It is Van Gaal’s fault that De Gea has not renewed. He wanted to renew last summer but Van Gaal wanted Keylor Navas at United rather than De Gea. [Marca via Sport Witness]    (something tells me Marca are a little upset they might not be getting De Gea this year :D)     Sergio Ramos:   Sergio Ramos has been named Real Madrid’s new captain. He is also on their pre-season tour.  Sergio Ramos personally called Van Gaal to insure him that he wanted to join Manchester United. United are willing to pay up to £42.6m (€60m) for Ramos, but they will not go any higher. [Don Balón] Real Madrid will not let Ramos (or any other high profile player) leave the club until new additions are made to the squad. [Don Balón]     Victor Valdes:   Victor Valdes’ agent, Gines Carvajal: ""I’ve been contacted by a series of individuals from Turkey to negotiate a move for Victor. But I haven’t spoken with the president of the Turkish club in question. I don’t know him. I have no plans to talk with them again as my player has no interest in a move to Antalyaspor. His only wishes are to remain at Manchester United and he has another year left on his contract. We don’t see any reason for him to leave the club. United are among the top two or three best teams in the world. Victor is keen to fight for a place next season and wants to help the club as much as he can.” [AS] His agent offered him to Real Madrid. [Sport] Later on Monday, it was revealed that Valdes was not included in the Manchester United squad that flew to the US for their pre-season tour.      Misc:   Rafael has been offered to Roma by Manchester United. [Gazzetta dello Sport] Van Gaal isn’t desperate for a new striker. He’s happy to play Memphis there as he did during the World Cup last summer. [De Telegraaf] Edinson Cavani is Van Gaal’s No 1 option to replace RvP. [Guardian’s Jamie Jackson] Robert Lewandowski is actually Van Gaal’s No 1 option to replace RvP. [Telegraph’s Mark Ogden] No, it’s actually Christian Benteke who Van Gaal wants.

Regardless of how many competitions we would play in, these players won't be happy about sitting on the bench.   2 wide players - Depth: Memphis, Young, Mata, di Maria, Valencia, Januzaj, Lingard = 7 players, 2 spots.  1 striker - Depth: Rooney, Wilson. Add a new striker there, he'll just be sitting as back up to Rooney, who we know will always play when fit."
reddevils,3d6ngm,nnny7,20,Mon Jul 13 23:15:20 2015 UTC,"Charlie Austin as a back up striker / 2nd option would be great for us, if he's willing to accept that role. Sell Evans and bring in Otamendi and we're looking strong as ever."
reddevils,3d6ngm,GarethGore,10,Mon Jul 13 23:19:43 2015 UTC,Could also include Memphis in the list for strikers. I'd say he's pretty much guaranteed to get a few games at least as ST
reddevils,3d6ngm,GarethGore,6,Mon Jul 13 23:24:33 2015 UTC,"I still disagree, I think we need another striker, Wilson is 19 and relying on a 30 year old and a 19 year old is folly, we won't challenge for anything and we lacked goals massively last season. one solid mid 20s striker and I think for goals we have enough depth."

reddevils,3d6ngm,KERMITtheKILLA,2,Mon Jul 13 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Obviously not the best situation, but as we saw at Real Madrid with a good supporting cast behind him. Chicharito can play up top with enough effectiveness to win games... Assuming he doesn't have any suitors that come calling."

reddevils,3d6ngm,MonsieurRyan,12,Tue Jul 14 06:26:43 2015 UTC,I think we're a centreback away from challenging for the title. The players we currently have in defense are all pretty unexperienced even though they are very talented.   Don't think a striker will be a big deal as Rooney is rarely injured and he seems to be cooled down so he isn't picking up red cards that often anymore.
reddevils,3d6ngm,Muppetx,21,Mon Jul 13 23:02:30 2015 UTC,"TBH, having a real RB is going to do wonders for our defence, as well as a decent run and good luck with fitness.  A back line of  Shaw - Rojo - Smalling - Darmien    Looks damn good to me, if you ask me, especially if you stick,  Herrera - Schweinsteiger - Schneiderlin   In front of them.  As I said so many times last season, one of the main issues with our performances last year, LvG asking all the forward players to do their shift plus one extra, limiting their attacking prowess, was down to the weak spine of the team, specifically the centre of the midfield.  Having a real RB, and that mix of midfield in front of them, while I'd still like us to get a top class centre-half (no idea why there isn't even any lazy journalistic links to Thiago Silva tbh), I would actually be ok with us going into the season with that back 4.  Also, depth wise,  Shaw/Blind - Rojo/Evans - Smalling/Jones - Darmien/Valencia   and the youngsters,  McNair, Blackett et al"
reddevils,3d6ngm,aa93,13,Mon Jul 13 23:41:51 2015 UTC,"Shaw - Rojo - Smalling - Darmien   I'll be honest... And I realize I might be in the minority here, but I feel like bringing in an older, experienced CB for two or three seasons might not be ideal. Going by Rojo's form last fall before the injury, he looked absolute quality. I expect him to be better this season. Smalling with his form from Jan/Feb --> summer was immense, one of the best in the league at CB in that period. The two have qualities that complement each other really well too. As the silly idealist I am, I love it when we put our faith in our own players to see them make the leap from good to fan-fucking-tastic. Having Schneiderlin/Carrick ahead of them will do wonders as well.  My only concern is the injury history of Smalling in particular. That is the main risk involved with putting our faith in them to carry our defense next year."
reddevils,3d6ngm,MonsieurRyan,3,Tue Jul 14 06:25:44 2015 UTC,"I'm glad I'm not the only one that thinks this!  I'm not entirely convinced that we need a 100% proven CB, even if we do sell Evans. Rojo, Smalling, Jones are all good players that could develop to be top class and the young kids - McNair and Blackett - still need experience and are very decent options if injuries pop up."
reddevils,3d6ngm,rdzzl,5,Tue Jul 14 15:47:34 2015 UTC,Darmian*
reddevils,3d6ngm,ataniris,5,Tue Jul 14 02:41:36 2015 UTC,I would say that as long as DDG stays our current center backs would be enough to win the title.
reddevils,3d6ngm,GarethGore,10,Mon Jul 13 23:05:22 2015 UTC,I disagree with that. Don't think a team should ever rely on their goalkeeper as much as we did last season.
reddevils,3d6ngm,MonsieurRyan,3,Mon Jul 13 23:06:57 2015 UTC,"Shouldn't, but could. The depth we get at FB with Darmian, plus Schweini and Schneiderlin freeing up Blind and stabilizing the midfield, means a lot of our issues last year go away.  If Rojo and Jones/Smalling can build chemistry as a CB pair (big if, I know,) we could be serious contenders with the squad we have right now."
reddevils,3d6ngm,GarethGore,2,Tue Jul 14 00:46:52 2015 UTC,I agree. But our CBs are good enough. And now with the added support in midfield I think they will look a lot better this season.
reddevils,3d6ngm,p0wnager,4,Mon Jul 13 23:24:35 2015 UTC,"But our CBs are good enough.    Rojo from August -> December  Smalling from Chelsea game in 2015 to --> Summer  are definitely good enough, yeah. My only worry is the injury history of Smalling."
reddevils,3d6ngm,035036503530,2,Tue Jul 14 06:26:41 2015 UTC,De Gea is an excellent keeper but I think his concentration is still a bit on the low side for a keeper at a truly top team. He's world class when the defense in front of him is rubbish and shots are raining in but I can't help but think he can get caught being complacent when the team are dominating. That goal Benteke scored at the end of last season comes to mind.

There's no way we are good enough without a world class CB.   I'll give it about a week before those posts start and then pick up.
reddevils,3d6ngm,DatGuyRich,4,Tue Jul 14 06:30:39 2015 UTC,"Nah, there's potentially 3 signings to come. CB, striker and goalie."
reddevils,3d6ngm,GarethGore,3,Mon Jul 13 23:57:32 2015 UTC,7 signings could be a real clusterfuck in terms of the squad settling. Tottenham and Liverpool have both been burned in recent seasons.  I'd argue that last season signing 6 players was challenging enough. I think we have done well so far and could probably get away with signing one more player. It helps that Schneiderlin has played in England before and that Depay and Schweinsteiger speak English well. We should be cautious about this since we already know it takes players some time to adapt to LVG's philosophy.
reddevils,3d6ngm,thatshitlerscanoe,2,Tue Jul 14 15:53:47 2015 UTC,"Otamendi is still off on holidays after Copa America so I would say if it was to happen, it'll be in a few weeks after we get back from the States and he's gone back to Valencia."

There's a chance in this window we'd get a top 'keeper, centre-back, right-back, defensive midfielder, central midfielder, winger and striker, and that's not even being overkill.  If that does happen (with DDG leaving), they're fairly necessary transfers.  If DDG does go, it's not inconceivable that we have a similar sale list DDG, Evans, Rafael, Cleverley, Nani, RvP, Falcao, Chicharito.

I think the Ramos deal is conditional on RM getting DDG, and that will likely drag on into August. Until then I think we will sit tight on signing any other central defenders.  A loan option for a striker would be good but I think we will make do with all our attacking options instead of signing here. That includes a set of #10's playing behind Rooney like Mata, Januzaj and potentially even Fellaini or kids like Lingard and Pereira.   I think it would be wise to hold on to Hernandez. If we do sell him this window it's an indication we will sign someone but perhaps this can be a signing to boost the squad come January."

reddevils,3d5lnk,AUGsThoughts,20,Mon Jul 13 20:19:29 2015 UTC,Is Valencia still Ecuador captain?
reddevils,3d5lnk,MushroomBot,8,Mon Jul 13 19:15:52 2015 UTC,"According to Wikipedia, Ecuador's captain is Walter Ayoví."
reddevils,3d5lnk,JOOPLP,14,Mon Jul 13 19:24:07 2015 UTC,I think it was only for the Copa America since Valencia was out at the time.
reddevils,3d5lnk,X_SADBOY_X,5,Mon Jul 13 19:35:03 2015 UTC,Yup he is still their captain.
reddevils,3d5lnk,fleaonnj4,15,Mon Jul 13 22:35:41 2015 UTC,We have Transfer Window captain too.

reddevils,3d5lnk,Bigassbird,15,Mon Jul 13 20:36:44 2015 UTC,Rooney was pretty fat back then wasn't he...
reddevils,3d5lnk,Hassi94,30,Mon Jul 13 18:33:17 2015 UTC,Tbh I think its having not much hair that makes him look bigger
reddevils,3d5lnk,ijd17,-4,Mon Jul 13 18:43:01 2015 UTC,Look at his belly on the left (our left) and his hips on the right. Definitely a lot slimmer nowadays.
reddevils,3d5lnk,Hassi94,21,Mon Jul 13 20:13:37 2015 UTC,What belly? I seriously think it's just the shirt man.
reddevils,3d5lnk,PastorPanda,5,Mon Jul 13 20:16:08 2015 UTC,Agreed on the (lack of) belly but he's definitely slimmer now than he is here.   He's not fat by any stretch in that picture but he's definitely been a lot leaner since he came back from the time off at Nike after the transfer request fiasco.

reddevils,3d5lnk,Trickybuz93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:11:57 2015 UTC,"Players who regularly practice leadership is a key factor in the success of the club team. And that factor, to me, is the biggest thing for me in Schweinsteiger's signing.  During our most recent successful period, 2008-2011, we had players like VDS, Evra, Park, Fletcher, Rooney, Ronaldo, all were captains on top of Giggs, Scholes, Rio, Vidic, Neville... We were literally fielding the most mentally powerful team in the world at the time. If one of them had a bad day, ANYONE could have taken up the leadership immediately. They all know how to lead AND follow.  Robin Van Persie's ability to lead showed when he first joined us and his leaving left the biggest hole in leadership because we all knew he would get less and less time on the field.  We need more of that. Now we have Rooney and Schweinsteiger as national team captains. Carrick is important for us in that aspect and I feel Mata is close to that status now. Valdes can. We need someone like that in the back and I hoped Rafael and Evans had it in them but are out of favor. Smalling is coming along nicely though and Jones, I think he can, too. Schneiderlin has experience in french youth teams. We have a great set of players who got their head screwed on right to follow these leaders and/or maybe become one themselves in the future, like Rojo, Herrera, Darmian, Depay. Our golden days of being a regular CL finals featuring team may be very soon."
reddevils,3d5lnk,kwonster,2,Tue Jul 14 02:11:06 2015 UTC,I would add Ashley Young.  Him coming on due to Luke Shaw injury against Arsenal away was a turning point in last season imo.  Immediately started barking orders when he came on to get everyone switched on and we end up winning 2-1 when it looked like we were about to get smashed.  Not to mention his composure to score against Newcastle.  The goal and assists in the derby.  Plus his assist for the away win at Crystal Palace.  He was a huge player for us last season.
reddevils,3d5lnk,AidoPotatoe,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:50:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah we had so many captains back then with vidic, Park and Ronaldo. I was actually a little surprise that now we've only got schweinsteiger and Rooney as national captains"

reddevils,3d5lnk,buddhabrax,2,Tue Jul 14 02:41:11 2015 UTC,"Ah, everyone knows that even with Messi in the team its Mascherano who's the real captain."
reddevils,3dd6qe,hdee804,11,Wed Jul 15 10:09:49 2015 UTC,"I like the way we're handling the De Gea situation. We're really bending Real Madrid over a barrel, because of things like this. They have the most expectant fans in the world, and if they want someone (like De Gea), they will get very, very unhappy if they don't get him. This puts us in a position of strength, and if he does go this summer it'd be on our terms and not theirs."
reddevils,3dd6qe,craigybacha,5,Wed Jul 15 11:23:55 2015 UTC,There was talk of Aguero but It would probably need to be a WR bid to get him. Actually don't think they'll make a 'marquee' signing this year.
reddevils,3dd6qe,Don_Makaveli,-8,Wed Jul 15 10:27:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I don't think DDG is a marquee signing, either. Really hard to perceive a goalkeeper as being a marquee. I'm trying to remember a non-attacking 'marquee' at Madrid…"
reddevils,3dd6qe,felinenimbostratus,11,Wed Jul 15 10:43:33 2015 UTC,"I don't think DDG is a marquee signing, either.   One of the best keepers in the world at the moment? Okay."
reddevils,3dd6qe,meplusone,7,Wed Jul 15 10:51:29 2015 UTC,"De Gea would of course be a marquee signing!  Arguably the 2nd or 3rd best keeper in the world, a local to Madrid and has the potential to play for 10+ years! Not to mention they now NEED to fill his position with top quality!  Just because the price probably won't reflect the usual Galactico signing doesn't mean he's not a marquee signing. Don't be such a jabroni, bro."
reddevils,3dd6qe,mufctez,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:52:18 2015 UTC,"I think people tend to associate marquee signings and galacticos with the undisputed best. I think De Gea is a terrific goalkeeper, but I don't think he's irreplaceable. The factors which make him attractive to Madrid -- the locality, his age -- aren't the qualities which dictate marquee status.  A marquee signing -- Zidane, Ronaldo, Figo, Fat Ronaldo -- is someone who is the best in the world in their position. They're in a league of their own. They will cost an arm and a leg, but Madrid sign them because money is no object. They're significantly better than the next best person in their position.  I don't think that's true of De Gea."
reddevils,3dd6qe,felinenimbostratus,3,Wed Jul 15 11:49:41 2015 UTC,"Disagree completely. If its a world-class goalkeeper (which De Gea is) who replaces a club legend (Casillas) that's a marquee signing if there ever was one. Plus, Cannavaro in 2006 (and Beckham was a central midfielder there)"
reddevils,3dd6qe,DevilDonnie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:53:36 2015 UTC,I don't think anyone would suggest that Beckham was a defensive player. Cannavaro pretty much the only defensive marquee they've signed (or at least the only one people are referring to here).  It's probably as much for the paucity of talented goalkeepers around that it's hard to envisage a comparison. E.g. I wouldn't see it as a marquee if United signed Courtois from Chelsea.
reddevils,3dd6qe,felinenimbostratus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:46:53 2015 UTC,I would because he is top 3 in the world when it comes to his position. Do you consider Bale a marquee signing?
reddevils,3dd6qe,DevilDonnie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:29:03 2015 UTC,"Good question!  I would say DDG isn't because of a combination of factors (gone into in earlier comments and elsewhere in this thread).  Bale I'd say IS a marquee signing: cost, his ability (probably best left winger in the world… if you assume Ronaldo is just a freak who plays in 'attack' rather than from a specific position), and his profile as being able to singlehandedly destroy teams. I'd say DDG has had flashes of form throughout seasons where he has been incredible, but I don't think he's had that same impact as Schmeichel, Giggs, Ronaldo, Messi, where you feel that just because you have him, you are much more likely to win the game against any opposition."
reddevils,3dd6qe,felinenimbostratus,2,Wed Jul 15 14:42:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say Cannavaro comes closest to a galactico non attacker.  World player of the year, Ballon d'Or and had captained Italy to a world cup win. I think they are filled with big marketable names in their attacking line up at the moment. The defence and goalkeepers, not so much."
reddevils,3dd6qe,viv0102,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:29:33 2015 UTC,"Ah I forgot about him. Great signing and great player -- you're right, he was pretty much as close as it gets to a defensive marquee signing."
reddevils,3dd6qe,felinenimbostratus,3,Wed Jul 15 11:45:50 2015 UTC,"They might not buy anyone this year, with Barca banned.   In the last couple of years it looked to me that they were more or less forced to buy big names, because Barca did and the fans were unhappy. Basically they bought Bale after Barcelona bought Neymar and they got James after the others got Suarez.  It also doesn't look like there is anyone available, top clubs don't sell their best players and I don't think there is anyone good enough at lower level clubs(like Suarez or Bale a few years back)."
reddevils,3dd6qe,Jujux,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:27:22 2015 UTC,"With their own potential ban hanging over them though they need to make signings now though. That was part of the reason for many of Barcas signings over the last couple of years, they could have maybe negotiated better but they knew they had to buy to see them through the ban"
reddevils,3dd6qe,wakey87433,2,Wed Jul 15 14:48:23 2015 UTC,"Considering the pressure their fans are putting on RM, Chanting De Gea during Danilo's unveiling etc. I have a feeling they will probably pay like £25m. They've got rid of Casillas and only have Navas who has the quality to start for them. They need another Keeper and it wouldn't make sense for them to get a GK this summer and then get De Gea next summer.   Honestly I'd find it ok if they paid £25m tbh. He's on the last year of his contract, obviously isn't going to sign an extension, and we could use that money to buy Leno/Oblak/Perin etc."
reddevils,3dd6qe,StannisJr,13,Wed Jul 15 10:29:37 2015 UTC,We don't need Real's money. We want their players. This is why this is still going on. Real would in all likelihood dream of being able to sign him for just money.
reddevils,3dd6qe,lordmaximus92,2,Wed Jul 15 10:37:04 2015 UTC,"We don't, but I don't see us getting anything better out of it. Apparently we've bid 45m euro for Ramos, which is obviously then a completely separate transfer. It's either a player swap which usually never happens or a world record fee for a Goalkeeper who they could sign on a pre-contract in Jan. Logically, they would be stupid to bid for a world record fee for him. They don't even need him that much, as their whole team is pretty much based on outscoring the opponent and their defense is pretty much world class."
reddevils,3dd6qe,StannisJr,6,Wed Jul 15 10:44:14 2015 UTC,"Logically they would bid a world record fee for De Gea if he didn't have only 1 year left on his contract. Why should we let him go for less when we don't need the money and we want the player?  'They don't need him that much'? Since when has that ever influenced a Real Madrid galactico signing? I'm not sure you understand (a) the galactico policy or (b) how important it is to Real Madrid to have the spanish number 1 keeper, especially when he will probably be that for the next decade.  As for us, it's a matter of principle. We know De Gea is going to leave at some point. We either get another year of a world class goalkeeper or lose him for what he's worth, setting a precedent that if you're going to buy our best players, you're going to have to break the bank for them. Ed Woodward said when he arrived that he wanted to turn the tide and didn't want the best players to be sold to Madrid/ Barca, but rather to make Manchester United the place where these players want to go to. Ed doesn't want to be held to ransom, or have his back against the wall- and quite right too. There's really absolutely no advantage to the 25 million when we are already rolling in cash and have 600k off our weekly wage bill as it is.   Finally, imagine if we got to the Champions League final against Real next year (not saying that will happen), and they had DDG in goal rather than us. Would you not regret letting him go then?"
reddevils,3dd6qe,lordmaximus92,0,Wed Jul 15 10:49:15 2015 UTC,"Logically they would bid a world record fee for De Gea if he didn't have only 1 year left on his contract.   That's what I meant.   Well considering they are willing to wait another year for him apparently, he's obviously important. Ramos also seems fairly happy, the captaincy has been passed onto him which is an honor. He'll probably get a contract upgrade soon. At least the main thing for us is that all the pressure is on Perez, but he seems adamant that Ramos isn't leaving."
reddevils,3dd6qe,StannisJr,4,Wed Jul 15 10:59:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is unless Real make an actual bid and one that values DDG at an acceptable price I actually think DDG will sign a new contract with us. As i have said before on this sub its Mendes way in general, while some agents will screw clubs over for a quick pay day Mendes is an agent focused on building relationships by being fair. It's why United use him as their agent in deals that don't involve his players because you know what you get with him. A number of his players have signed new deals at their club with an understanding that they will be allowed to discuss leaving the next summer if certain clubs meet a set bid amount (we saw that directly with Ronaldo)"
reddevils,3dd6qe,wakey87433,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:56:06 2015 UTC,So you think if De Gea does sign a new contract it will be after the window closes?
reddevils,3dd6qe,StannisJr,2,Wed Jul 15 15:01:03 2015 UTC,Maybe before as they may want it sorted one way ornate other before the first game of the season. Certainly the CL playoff would seem like a make or break point
reddevils,3dd6qe,wakey87433,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:03:50 2015 UTC,"This actually makes a lot of sense when you consider the agent fees in such transfers. Plus, De Gea is at a position of strength - a higher transfer fee increases your hype, which gets you a better salary too (Bale being paid more than Casillas, Ramos, etc. seems to suggest this)."

In the 2010/11 season for an example, their biggest signing was Ozil for about £12m which wasn't the most exciting thing at the time. The season after they spent are ridicules sum on Coentrao , another non-galactico signing. In 2008/2009 they bought Huntelaar as their marque signing.   They buy good players every season but they don't always make galactico signings and for the price De Gea would cost and the fact he is a keeper which isn't the most glamorous position, I wouldn't even call it a galactico signing.  I heard they were linked to Vidal which could potentially be a big signing for them."

Perez came into presidency for his second term during 2009/10 season only, so Huntelaar signing was not under his reign.  As far as 2010/11 season goes, they also signed Khedira, and Di Maria (if I remember correctly).   They buy good players every season but they don't always make galactico signings and for the price De Gea would cost and the fact he is a keeper which isn't the most glamorous position, I wouldn't even call it a galactico signing.

reddevils,3d7yxl,A_hiccup,9,Tue Jul 14 05:37:34 2015 UTC,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddevils/comments/2ribji/youth_rankings_5_sean_goss/  This is what /u/monsieurryan and /u/rdzzl had to say about Goss in the Youth Ranking series they did a couple of months ago.
reddevils,3d7yxl,Yaja23,3,Tue Jul 14 06:57:00 2015 UTC,"In short, he is a young, left footed version of a Michael Carrick in the makings. Injuries are his main concern at this point, as he progresses really nice every time you watch him play. Very smart, very elegant and it is obvious he has a great understanding of the dynamics of the game from his spot in midfield."
reddevils,3d7yxl,rdzzl,2,Tue Jul 14 07:02:38 2015 UTC,"Are you surprised that Goss went through   No.   like Ben Pearson on tour   Yes. I thought he deserved his chance this summer. I am hoping (half assuming) that this means he's on his way on a loan to a good team and will spend the pre-season with them. The same goes with Rothwell. Both are, in my opinion, better players than Goss at the moment. Though all three of them are excellent youth prospects.   For people who have watched him more often for the reserves, what are your opinions of where he can develop to play?   See the link from /u/Yaja23   Do you think he will feature in United's squad this season?   No, I think it is too early. Especially with the influx of midfielders this summer and last."
reddevils,3d7yxl,rdzzl,2,Tue Jul 14 07:15:09 2015 UTC,Let's goss about Goss
reddevils,3d7yxl,Illum503,2,Tue Jul 14 08:01:51 2015 UTC,Yes. Pearson/Rothwell were probably more expected to go on tour in my book. No. Not even in Cup games. But I thought the same thing about Blackett prior to tour last season. I think I am one of the few that actually rates him fairly highly. He has had injury problems which has held him back.
reddevils,3d7yxl,MonsieurRyan,3,Tue Jul 14 11:59:01 2015 UTC,I don't think Schneiderlin was signed to play the pivot role but for the defensive CM. Don't think he can dictate play well enough tbh but he's a good passer so he fits that CM mould perfectly.  Can't offer an opinion on Goss though
reddevils,3d7yxl,kw9403,2,Tue Jul 14 05:43:44 2015 UTC,I agree with you insofar I would like to see one of Bastian/Carrick in the DM role if they're fit. Half of me thinks that signing Schweinsteiger will extend the careers of them both and that they'll be rotated.  Though I do think Schneiderlin has the potential to develop under LvG to a point where he could be the real deal as a single pivot DM.  Edit: Apologies that my answer is also unrelated to Goss. I don't watch enough youth games to comment but I've heard good things about him. I think a few are surprised that it's Goss being taken instead of Pearson. Best person to ask is /u/monsieurryan. He's the guy in the know when it comes to the youth players.

reddevils,3d44nj,Geoffpecar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:25:59 2015 UTC,Sterling's got what he wants though and it's looking like De Gea might not.  Says a lot about how transfers work.   Personally I find it really shady employment law wise that players can't just hand in their notice like any regular person in a normal job. It would be ridiculous if I was legally obliged to work my job for two years in a country I no longer wished to live in. It's bizarre that that is legally enforceable. I think one day someone will successfully challenge that like Bosman did.
reddevils,3d44nj,JuanRiquelme,2,Mon Jul 13 16:55:06 2015 UTC,I have a non-compete clause in my work contract. I can not move to a competitor or I have to basically sit out a year. And I'm not even important.

I don't think that shit is legal here  From a bit of research they do exist but only in extreme circumstances where you're protecting business secrets etc.. And they get taken down in court a lot.

They can't force someone to play, but I guess if a player refuses to play they could take legal action for breach of contract,  as they've agreed to play for the club for this set length? I don't know if that's the case? Just like the club couldn't just decide they don't need them any more and sack them whilst they're still in contract.  It would be a bit harsh if you could pay all this money for a player and sign this multi year deal with them and the they could just go and quit. Its gonna leave you with a problem and a loss of revenue."
reddevils,3d44nj,daveyp2tm,239,Mon Jul 13 23:19:15 2015 UTC,Amen. He's been nothing but a pro about it. He's gave the media nothing to run with and hasn't put the club in a difficult media situation whatsoever.  From his point of view I can imagine the frustration if he genuinely wants to go back to Madrid at the length of the saga. Fair play indeed for keeping schtum.
reddevils,3d44nj,craptionbot,11,Mon Jul 13 11:06:28 2015 UTC,Interesting that 2 months ago a lot of the comments at the top of threads on here were people going nuts about him not signing or saying anything/leaving us in the lurch/not being open.  Agreed it's good that he's not kicking up a fuss though. Some transparency would also be great as opposed to the drip feed of information from the last few months.

reddevils,3d44nj,hardgour,7,Mon Jul 13 15:12:43 2015 UTC,"If he does stay, I don't wee why he wouldn't sign a new contract.   If he does want to go to Madrid, why would he sign a new contract? That would mean United could choose not to sell him once again and he could lose his chance to go back.   Plus, leaving at the end of his contract would mean he'd have better negotiating rights to get a better wage from Madrid."

reddevils,3d44nj,Reflex2011,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:59:44 2015 UTC,"Well if you are signed to a contract you are obligated to see out your contract no matter what job you're in, especially when big money is involved.   I don't know what you do but if you worked for a company that made you sign a contract and you just decided to leave for another company you will get sued to fuck especially if you're a high ranking person for that company.  Sterling can get a new job all he had to do is quit his job and work in another job, what sterling is doing is leaving a company to join a rival company and that's a no go when you sign contracts."

reddevils,3d44nj,LucaRiolu493,-1,Mon Jul 13 19:21:07 2015 UTC,Well transfer fees only work because FIFA won't let you register without the selling clubs consent.  If sterling wanted to retire or swap to Rugby he could do it immediately and Liverpool would have zero financial recourse outside of giving him a bad reference.  I'm just not sure what FIFA is doing is really legal and don't think it would stand up in an EU court if someone challenged it

reddevils,3d44nj,BigCheeser,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:42 2015 UTC,"One difference you seem to be overlooking is that footballer contracts are for a set period (usually up to 5 years), during which they have agreed to perform a service for the club (play football). If, two years in, they decide they don't want to do it and leave, that puts the club in an unfair position as they have planned for life as if the contract would be fulfilled. I wouldn't say it's the same as employment because and employment contract can only be terminated whereas a footballer's contract can simply expire. It's not like they're bound for life. It is the responsibility of the footballer to be aware of their obligations before they sign the contract.  If I know 20k a week is not enough and I don't want to play for Spurs for 4 years, I will NOT sign a 20k p/w, 4-year contract with them. Simples. Just as the club cannot kick a player out because they don't want him anymore (unless they offer the full wages)."

reddevils,3d44nj,ReaperX24,0,Mon Jul 13 12:17:16 2015 UTC,That contract would never stand up in court imo. Not in the EU where workers have some rights anyway.

They have both made it clear they want to leave behind closed doors. The only reason why De Gea hasn't came out is because he knows he will get abuse if he has to play this season.  He has clearly been speaking with Real Madrid behind the back of United, and I'm sure they have told him not to sign a new contract and they will make their move. Then you have idiots like you who say he deserves respect? The guy no longer wants to play for us, he hasn't earned legend status to be allowed to go peacefully.

Neither he, nor the club have given the media a single ounce of leverage. In fact, Real Madrid have been pretty quiet as well.  I suspect there's some sort of pre agreement in place between the clubs, similar to the Ronaldo deal. If so, I think that benefits all parties and is a truly professional way to do things.

reddevils,3d4who,Rept4r7,12,Tue Jul 14 05:10:52 2015 UTC,I'd argue the main argument for him not going is how the fans treat their players.   Every player should expect to become surplus to requirements at some point in their career. Sure Perez could be less of a cock about it but clubs get rid of deadwood all the time.
reddevils,3d4who,cousinrayray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:17:49 2015 UTC,"True, The shitty fans are a far bigger factor than Perez but the point still stands that he is forced out of his club appallingly even though he is a legend.

reddevils,3d4who,cousinrayray,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:13:42 2015 UTC,"Whilst I don't disagree with you in terms of Casillas ability, we don't know what goes on behind closed doors.  There have been reports for years that he's been toxic in the dressing room and sometimes players are shown the door for things other than ability, regardless of length or quality of historical service. Examples: Keane, Beckham, Stam. Those are just a few from our own club with arguable only one being in the decline of ability like Casillas."

LVG is trying to point out to De Gea that it could happen to him. Perez is there because he believes it's a money tree. /fin

Last season his form fell and he was booed to shit by fans and recently left in what many people say was a very disrespectful and disgusting send off by the club. LVG is pointing out how Real Madrid fans will turn on you the moment you start underperforming and if you go there in the future you will end up like Casillas."

reddevils,3d4u4b,omegaxLoL,15,Mon Jul 13 16:03:59 2015 UTC,"Fellaini was totally out of breath in his. Schneiderlin was playing in League One five seasons ago and now he's playing for United, so I could understand his being nervous too."
reddevils,3d4u4b,macAaronE,2,Mon Jul 13 16:29:27 2015 UTC,This interview will probably be watched by more people than watched his average game at Southampton. As much as all pro footballers aren't normal there is a huge gulf between media exposure at United and at other professional clubs. Hell even other top 4 clubs aren't under the degree of scrutiny. It is likely more people watched Schneiderlin's initial interview than will watch the same for Sterling.  So yeah I can totally understand an ex-Southampton player suddenly realising how intense the spot light on him is now.

reddevils,3d470a,peduxe,15,Mon Jul 13 11:45:38 2015 UTC,Scneiderlin trumps any signing we make this window simply coz we have been missing a player for that position for too long.

reddevils,3d470a,Johnson90,7,Mon Jul 13 12:14:21 2015 UTC,I never said it wouldn't be great to have DDG for the long term but I don't see it happening in any way for more than 1 season now. Despite how much you me and everyone would want him to stay he'll probably leave next season and we will have to get another keeper if we don't want Valdez as our no.1  So if he signs a new contract helping us get more for him next season from Real that's great and all but not a better deal than finally solving our midfield woes.

As a 11 year old kid living in Iowa, I couldn't really follow the team that closely, so I only knew the ""big"" names like Giggs, Scholes, Beckham, RvN, Keane, etc. I saw they were coming to America for pre-season and I convinced my parents to drive me and take me to the closest game. All the ads for the tour had the aforementioned players featured prominently. I was so stoked. I was a pretty disappointed when the only player I knew that showed up was Keane. I didn't even recognize another player on the squad.   Now I'm obsessed enough with all things United that I'd be stoked even if it was only the likes of Lingard, Blackett, and Johnstone coming over, but I think it's great us United fans in America get to see all the top talent!

reddevils,3d4e44,rdzzl,7,Mon Jul 13 13:03:36 2015 UTC,Yeah. I heard rumors that he might be the only youngster going on tour. Probably because he is a left footed midfielder. But hopefully he will seize this opportunity.
reddevils,3d4e44,QuillRat,10,Mon Jul 13 12:55:36 2015 UTC,"I heard rumors that he might be the only youngster going on tour   I did as well. Gribbin, Harrop probably would've gone if we hadn't completed the deals this weekend. Only 4 matches to play too so no point taking a bunch of youngsters when there are so few games."
reddevils,3d4e44,rdzzl,2,Mon Jul 13 13:00:18 2015 UTC,Few young players in the u21's tonight atleast.
reddevils,3d4e44,llorTeciN,4,Mon Jul 13 17:32:13 2015 UTC,Must admit I am really disappointed at the lack of U21/U18 talents on this list. Was hoping for Tuanzebe/Rothwell/Pearson to go at least

reddevils,3d4e44,TY1901,30,Mon Jul 13 18:16:46 2015 UTC,Goodbye Rafael.
reddevils,3d4e44,shredderrrrrr,32,Mon Jul 13 12:53:15 2015 UTC,I'd rather say goodbye to Evans. Rafael could have still been our back up RB
reddevils,3d4e44,pilonpilesh,5,Mon Jul 13 13:14:48 2015 UTC,"I'd definitely rather see Evans gone than Rafael, but I'd be cool with both of them leaving. I think Valencia is a far better option for RB solely because he is never hurt--which is something you want in the the backup. It makes no sense having a backup player that is only even ready to play 20% of the time."
reddevils,3d4e44,googly__moogly,2,Mon Jul 13 15:47:31 2015 UTC,Valencia is a good make shift RB. He played his role well last season. Was RB most of the time.
reddevils,3d4e44,Schneidsteiger,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:37:28 2015 UTC,"Agreed. While I don't think he is good enough at RB to be a starter for a team at United's level, I think he is a solid backup."
reddevils,3d4e44,SonofIndia,4,Tue Jul 14 14:42:35 2015 UTC,Valencia & Smalling will be our back up right backs.  It's good business to sell Rafael while we can still get a fee for him.
reddevils,3d4e44,tommym109,6,Mon Jul 13 15:05:20 2015 UTC,I doubt we'll ever see Smalling at right back in a United shirt again. He's never played there under LVG. Jones is the more likely transplant if necessary. McNair has played there also. Valencia is a more than adequate back up though.
reddevils,3d4e44,chrisgorm,5,Mon Jul 13 16:13:48 2015 UTC,"Saw another post about De Gea's professionalism. How about Rafa's then? Not even a peep about being marginalized so, after 7 glorious years at the club. Gosh, I'll miss him when he leaves. Especially for his Anfield-special performances."

reddevils,3d4e44,chrisgorm,19,Mon Jul 13 23:33:43 2015 UTC,Wonder what happened To Reece James and why Varela isn't getting a chance
reddevils,3d4e44,googly__moogly,9,Mon Jul 13 12:53:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, James looked good last pre-season. Probably due to an overload of LBs."
reddevils,3d4e44,llorTeciN,4,Mon Jul 13 12:54:54 2015 UTC,But we only have Shaw & Blind (not actually a LB) so I thought having an actually left back would have been a blessing. He also reminds me of Jordi Alba lol
reddevils,3d4e44,chrisgorm,2,Mon Jul 13 12:55:56 2015 UTC,"How did I forget about Rojo. Wouldn't want to have to play Rojo LB, really like the look of James, hope he comes back soon if he goes on loan."
reddevils,3d4e44,Creamy_Goodne55,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:58:46 2015 UTC,"He's not good enough from what I've seen. Long way to go for him. Blind will probably be used at LB a lot more next season, now that we have a healthy midfield."
reddevils,3d4e44,Hassi94,4,Mon Jul 13 13:02:06 2015 UTC,James isn't good enough IMO but I thought Varela did really well for RM Castilla and should've been given a chance
reddevils,3d4e44,chrisgorm,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:16:40 2015 UTC,"I thought James was doing great up to his injury. Didn't get to see him when he got sent on loan a few times. Have to keep an eye this year, would love a piece on MUTV of them looking at our players we send on loan. (If they don't already do it)"
reddevils,3d4e44,Abcmsaj,2,Mon Jul 13 12:59:47 2015 UTC,Both will be playing in the U21 games no doubt. They always keep a few players back to play in those friendlies.  Saying that though I dont see James breaking into the team any time soon.

reddevils,3d4e44,macAaronE,17,Mon Jul 13 12:57:35 2015 UTC,De Gea but no Valdes... This GK situation is confusing!
reddevils,3d4e44,Neville-wears-prada,17,Mon Jul 13 12:59:47 2015 UTC,If Lingard has another good tour surely this is the year he'll be knocking on the first team door. He's done really well the last two tours - here's hoping he and the rest of the youngsters can do a job for us!
reddevils,3d4e44,macAaronE,-7,Mon Jul 13 12:55:49 2015 UTC,"He's 22, his big break trough should have already happened. He's not good enough and will never be good enough."
reddevils,3d4e44,Neville-wears-prada,13,Mon Jul 13 12:53:07 2015 UTC,That is entirely not true. Fergie called him a late bloomer and heaped praise on him. Giggs and Scholes love him. LVG loves him. He has excelled at every level. He broke in to the first team last season after an impressive preseason. Only an injury that wasn't his fault got in the way. Lingard has given no reason to believe that he's not good enough to this point.
reddevils,3d4e44,macAaronE,-11,Mon Jul 13 13:02:03 2015 UTC,Lingard has given no reason to believe that he's not good enough to this point.   Except for the fact that he is 22 now and has never shown anything consistently in the PL.
reddevils,3d4e44,Neville-wears-prada,4,Mon Jul 13 13:23:48 2015 UTC,"He has never had a shot to because of injury. He excelled at the levels he has played and he grabbed a first team shot at the start of last season. When has he not performed? He hasn't failed to impress, and you're just saying he's 22. Well, Didier Drogba, Luca Toni, and Miroslav Klose were all late-bloomers too. If LVG thinks Lingard should be playing, then he deserves another shot."
reddevils,3d4e44,shredderrrrrr,-10,Mon Jul 13 13:38:34 2015 UTC,"He has never had a shot to because of injury.   That's his fault. Not my fault that he got injured and because of that has not broke trough.   He excelled at the levels he has played    He was good in the u-21 and the championship, which is probably his level. This means nothing considering he has never played well consistently at a higher level (PL/CL).   he grabbed a first team shot at the start of last season.   Because of injuries, it's not like he was first choice or something.   When has he not performed?   When has he not performed? What kind of an question is that?   He hasn't failed to impress,   He has, when has he impressed at a higher level?   He hasn't failed to impress,   So are we going to hold on to all the youngsters in the hope that they are late-bloomers? No, because that is incredibly stupid."
reddevils,3d4e44,Neville-wears-prada,3,Mon Jul 13 13:45:41 2015 UTC,The injury was his fault? In what world was the injury his fault? It was a result of a sloppy challenge from Ashley Williams and is not a recurring one.
reddevils,3d4e44,iKells,-10,Mon Jul 13 13:52:12 2015 UTC,His problem is what I meant.
reddevils,3d4e44,Neville-wears-prada,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:00:36 2015 UTC,"This means nothing considering he has never played well consistently at a higher level (PL/CL).   So in order to deserve a chance at the PL/CL level, a player has to play consistently well at the PL/CL? How exactly do they do that?"
reddevils,3d4e44,shredderrrrrr,-5,Mon Jul 13 14:08:51 2015 UTC,When a player is 22 you expect him to at least have shown a bit at the highest level. Somethin Lindegaard has not done.
reddevils,3d4e44,Skest,8,Mon Jul 13 19:36:45 2015 UTC,"He got fucking injured in his first start,what else do you want him to do? There's a reason he started that game and it's because LvG think's he's good enough"
reddevils,3d4e44,Neville-wears-prada,-14,Mon Jul 13 20:01:30 2015 UTC,"Is it my fault that he got injured? He fucking got injured and that is why he has not broke through. Sure it is unfortunate that he got injured but that's just the way it is.  The reason he started was because of injuries, not because he was first choice or something."
reddevils,3d4e44,tamasuperstar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:50:08 2015 UTC,"Is it my fault that he got injured? He fucking got injured and that is why he has not broke through.

reddevils,3d4e44,theduckofreasoning,2,Mon Jul 13 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"Which is only one year younger than Lingard, and also why I said ""less so"".  Fact remains no one thought much of him until he really broke out.  Don't get me wrong I'm not suggesting Lingard is going to become Harry Kane. Just saying writing him off is entirely counterproductive and unnecessary."

reddevils,3d4e44,MullerReus,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:31:15 2015 UTC,Injuries have set him back he's gonna be a star. I've watched him through the reserves and his time on loan kids brilliant he will either break out here or somewhere else regrettably if he stays fit
reddevils,3d4e44,Neville-wears-prada,5,Mon Jul 13 19:59:56 2015 UTC,"Well he started in our first game last year and got injured, you can't just say he hasn't broken through?"
reddevils,3d4e44,f4xman,-7,Mon Jul 13 21:19:11 2015 UTC,you can't just say he hasn't broken through?   I can because he has not broken trough yet.
reddevils,3d4e44,Neville-wears-prada,3,Mon Jul 13 13:23:19 2015 UTC,"He started Van Gaals first game for us, he obviously thinks he is good enough if he trusted him there, he then got injured nothing to do with his quality."
reddevils,3d4e44,cousinrayray,-6,Mon Jul 13 13:34:32 2015 UTC,"He's not broken through and he is already 22, we don't even know how he will do after his injury. IIRC the only reason he was picked was because of injuries."

reddevils,3d4e44,OllieUnited18,-7,Mon Jul 13 13:40:44 2015 UTC,Fixed.
reddevils,3d4e44,Quik99,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"I get where you coming from but Van Gaal has taken him on the last tour and this one for a reason. If he didn't see anything in him he wouldn't waste his space on the plane when he could bring another of the U21's.  He's played him for a reason (up to his injury) and then sent him on loan where he was probably very aware at the first team chances that would be on offer to him elsewhere.  All in all, based on what we've seen from LVG so far, he's a logical and shrewd decision maker. There's probably no-one on that plane that is there to fill seats - they're all their because they will or may (see: Evans if not sold) have a part to play next year."
reddevils,3d4e44,nickooj,13,Mon Jul 13 13:52:58 2015 UTC,I guess that's Rafa gone. Will never forget that 12/13 season and those screamers against Liverpool and QPR
reddevils,3d4e44,McGrifty,11,Mon Jul 13 14:21:52 2015 UTC,The lack  of Valdes is a bit of a head-scratcher to me.... could mean one of  a few things: 1. He's injured 2. Dave is staying (pls) and he fancies a move away 3. He's been told another GK is coming in and fancies a move away 4. He was the slowest of the GKs to get to the airport 5. Aliens
reddevils,3d4e44,Muppetx,4,Mon Jul 13 12:57:24 2015 UTC,I will go with number 5.
reddevils,3d4e44,LucaRiolu493,3,Mon Jul 13 14:10:32 2015 UTC,Number 4 sounds fun. Last player to reach airport has to ride coach by himself due to lack of seats in the chartered plane.
reddevils,3d4e44,Muppetx,9,Mon Jul 13 14:16:52 2015 UTC,No rafael
reddevils,3d4e44,DatGuyRich,7,Mon Jul 13 16:37:46 2015 UTC,"No Valdes and no Rafael, seems like they're leaving."
reddevils,3d4e44,slaystation25,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:52:54 2015 UTC,"By this logic, is Evans staying? Or is he only included because we're light at CB without Rojo/any potential signings? still seems futile to include him if he's being moved on"
reddevils,3d4e44,weirdlytwisted,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:53:34 2015 UTC,Honestly I have no clue either. I think it might be because of your reason or because LvG wants to give him a second chance as he was the better one of Jones/Smalling/Evans before LvG came. Maybe Giggs has advised him.
reddevils,3d4e44,slaystation25,7,Wed Jul 15 14:55:06 2015 UTC,Only Goss and Andreas from the U21's is interesting
reddevils,3d4e44,weirdlytwisted,7,Wed Jul 15 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"The lack of players from the U21 team is upsetting. I was expecting to see Fletcher, Varela and Pearson at least."
reddevils,3d4e44,DelTrotter,7,Mon Jul 13 12:52:21 2015 UTC,It was to be expected. 4 new signings need time to gel in with all the other 1st teamers.
reddevils,3d4e44,saltymuffaca,2,Mon Jul 13 12:56:03 2015 UTC,"Understandable, but this was the best opportunity for Van Gaal to judge how the U21s would fit in with the senior squad.  Expecting for there to be an influx of young players from next season, once the current senior team is sorted."
reddevils,3d4e44,Hassi94,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:57:46 2015 UTC,"I think with the current squad depth, we would be struggling to give game time to Januzaj, Pereira and Lingard. Wilson too, if we bring in another striker. (Oh God it feels so good to say that.)  So I don't think he brought any extra players than those he thought could make it this season."

reddevils,3d4e44,Savage9645,3,Mon Jul 13 13:23:57 2015 UTC,Well it seemed obvious that Rafael was leaving.   Valdes case is a little strange but now I feel confident that De Gea is staying another season at least.   We now have a really good squad with solid depth in almost every position. Hope that a central defender joins our squad (Otamendi) and then we should try to offload Evans. We could round up a perfect transfer window by bringing a striker but I can't think of a player that could be available right now.

reddevils,3d4e44,lastofthesul,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:56:18 2015 UTC,I'd doubt we'll be fielding a full first team from the get-go. He's more likely to ease the team in as he's mentioned for the 2 smaller games. So youngsters will get huge chances lasting a whole half. You'd probably see more of a 1st team against Barcelona and PSG.

reddevils,3d4e44,rdzzl,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:54:19 2015 UTC,He had a great season last year. Would like to see Lindegaard start FA Cup and Johnstone have League Cup. Other than that it would have to be premier league or top level championship loan.

reddevils,3d4e44,weirdlytwisted,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:10:12 2015 UTC,He has a play style similar to Carrick but not as good defensively. He has a hell of a left foot. Not a great shot on him but can be useful occasionally. I think I am one of the few who actually rates him fairly decently. Still would not have expected him to go on tour over the likes of Pearson or Rothwell.
reddevils,3d4e44,lammot,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:47:59 2015 UTC,"I honestly am uncomfortable the shitty way LVG treats players he has no interest in or doesn't rate. Valdes is a vastly experienced GK, for Spain and Barca. You don't just give him hope by signing him then never playing him until the last game of the season, due to injury, then not selecting him.   Same thing happened playing Falcao and RVP in u-21s. It's very insulting. OK, so you sell RVP, like through the backdoor, no mention of his impact on the club or whatever. Even Fergie was never this ruthless.  Players are not cogs in a machine, they are human beings. Even if you don't rate Rafa, why not appreciate that he's been at the club for 7 years and send him off well. No need to have a testimonial but at least acknowledge his efforts.  What's even more frustrating is the fans silence on this. The fans are even more dehumanizing than LVG. Just buy and sell players like as if they are pieces of wood. Rio acknowledged the impact of Nani and RVP respectfully while also showing anticipation for new players. Sorry about the nature of this rant."

reddevils,3d4fah,nnny7,2,Mon Jul 13 14:44:43 2015 UTC,"Was going to post something similar. This is one of the biggest turn arounds I've ever seen. Going from a laughing stock, with numerous people calling for Gill to be brought back, or at least Woodward fired, to having this cult following after massive deal after massive deal being wrapped up.   Did he overpay for a few players? Sure, but not being in the CL tends to do that. Now being back, we're seeing a 13 million deal for an Italian international fullback winning player of the year and being included in team of the year (who also destroyed Clyne.) A 14 million deal for one of the best midfielders of his generation, a 24 million deal for one of the best midfielders in the league, and 25 million for one of, if not the best youth forward in the world.   I would be curious how influential LVG has been though. I'm sure LVG and Woodward both have their place, but never in a million years would I have seen Bastian sign for Moyes."

reddevils,3d5pb7,as520,11,Mon Jul 13 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"The rise of Morgan Schneiderlin has been both meteoric and impressive since he moved from his native France to join Southampton in 2008.  Schneiderlin was spotted by the Saints after moving up through the ranks at his local club, RC Strasbourg, where he had made five first-team appearances before making the switch across the Channel.  At just 18, the midfielder was already showing maturity beyond his years. Fans in England got a first glimpse of Schneiderlin during his time with France's Under-18s, after he featured in a friendly at Hartlepool's Victoria Park ground in September 2006. He had also been capped at Under-16 and Under-17 level, and would later go on to play for the Under-19s too.  Schneiderlin made his Southampton debut against Cardiff City in August 2008, but his first season at St Mary's would end in disappointment, as the club was relegated to League One. Despite speculation that a drop to the third tier would force him away from the club, Schneiderlin opted to aid the promotion effort. He scored his first goal for the club in April 2010, as the Saints beat Bristol Rovers 5-1 away, in one of his 37 appearances during the 2009/10 campaign.  Now established as a regular in the Southampton side, Schneiderlin helped the club climb out of League One at the end of 2010/11 and the Frenchman really came to the fore in the subsequent Championship campaign of 2011/12. A superb season for the midfielder resulted in a second successive promotion for the Saints, this time to the Barclays Premier League.  Schneiderlin now had the chance to test himself in the top flight, and he soon went from strength to strength. Although he had previously scored for Southampton away from home, his first goal at St Mary's came in August 2012 - against United. The Reds had the last laugh in a memorable encounter, with Robin van Persie's hat-trick securing a hard-earned 3-2 win.  Schneiderlin went on to miss just two league games as Southampton finished in 14th place, and was widely praised after topping the statistics charts for interceptions and tackles during the 2012/13 campaign. Little wonder he was named Player of the Year by Southampton's fans and by his teammates.  In the following season, 2013/14, Schneiderlin made 36 appearances as his club finished ninth and then earned his first senior cap for France when head coach Didier Deschamps selected him for a goalless draw against Jamaica in June. In the ensuing World Cup in Brazil, he made one appearance - in another 0-0 draw, this time against Ecuador, when future United teammate Antonio Valencia was sent off.  Schneiderlin continued his fine form on his return to club action in 2014/15 and made a total of 25 appearances to help Southampton qualify for the Europa League in seventh place. The Frenchman will now hope to play in the Champions League instead, with United, and add yet another layer of experience to his incredible story after becoming Louis van Gaal's fourth signing of summer 2015."

So you're right on that one.   I'm really excited to visit England and especially Manchester, let's hope I can do that in the next years, your country is so damn expensive compared to here :("

That way I get to set my stuff up once, turn it on 5 minutes before the match, and relax.  Not jump through constant hoops, bear through Spanish or Russian commentators and need to find a new source at best every month, at worst every 15 minutes.

He put in a shift for well over 100 caps but he also captained them for two largely dismal competitions and prior to that it was always a tough decision to have him or Lampard in the centre (as they just simply didn't work together) which resulted in Him and Gareth Barry being the ineffective spine of England for a while.  Maybe there's something I'm missing but he's treated like a God for largely being unsuccessful (and I am aware that that is not entirely his fault) other than an incredible 45 minutes in Istanbul."
reddevils,3d3i0u,MissingLink101,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:20:03 2015 UTC,Gerrard did fuck all for the national team.. We got knocked the fuck out of every tournament he played in at the quarter final stage or before.. He even assisted Suarez in the last world cup game that ended up knocking us out.   As for hating Liverpool? I cant help it but then again i do live in Manchester.. My opinion is thag if you want to embrace the club fully then you have to also embrace its rivalries. We hate Liverpool because we love to hate them!
reddevils,3d3i0u,_WhatIsReal_,2,Mon Jul 13 16:09:23 2015 UTC,He deserves respect as a player. I'm not such a child that I will chronically hate a player just because he played from the wrong team. Hate the club? Sure. Hate the people and the players? No.
reddevils,3d3i0u,IchDien,2,Mon Jul 13 14:40:09 2015 UTC,"I don't get what's wrong with praising Gerrard (or Lampard for that matter) when he left his club. Sure I won't ever cheer for him in a game when he donned a Liverpool shirt because I'll never cheer for Liverpool, but that doesn't make me hate him as a player/person or preclude me from admiring him as a footballer. There's been plenty of Liverpool players I've admired and envied including Gerrard. We at this sub love to make fun of him and his mistakes in the recent past (which is all good), but I think he's been among the top 3 English midfielders of his generation, so he kinda deserves some respect too, in a serious discussion anyway. (Much like we respect Pirlo, even though they're not in the same bracket).  I support United with all my heart but this ""throw hate at everyone who belongs to a certain club for no reason apart from the fact that they belong to that club"" is equally cringe-worthy if not more.  EDIT: Just to clarify, I meant praising him in general and not  pandering on Liverpool's sub. That particular act is pretty cringey, agreed."

There a registratoin period for each of the phases leading up to the groups  43.07 List A has to be submitted by the following fixed deadlines:  a. 22 June 2015 (24.00CET) for all matches in the first qualifying round;  b. 9 July 2015 (24.00CET) for all matches in the second qualifying round;  c. 23 July 2015 (24.00CET) for all matches in the third qualifying round;  d. 10 August 2015 (24.00CET) for all matches in the play-offs;  e. 1 September 2015 (24.00CET) for all further matches from the first match in  the group stage up to and including the final.  He can only be cup-tied if we sell him in January.

reddevils,3d550r,Allard1994,-1,Mon Jul 13 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"Provided we are still in the Champions League, De Gea would be cup tied.  If we were knocked out, he'd be able to play for Real or any other team.  Edit: UEFA's Champions League rule book clears this up:   43.08 As a rule, a player may not play in a UEFA club competition (i.e. UEFA ChampionsLeague  and  UEFA  Europa  League,  but  not  UEFA  Super  Cup)  for  more  than  oneclub  in  the  course  of  the  same  season.  Exceptionally,  however,  a  player  who  has been  fielded  in  the  first,  second,  third  qualifying  round  or  the  play-offs  of  the UEFA  Champions  League  or  UEFA  Europa  League  is  entitled  to  play  in  the  UEFA Champions  League  or  UEFA  Europa  League  for  another  club  as  from  the  groupstage. Moreover, as from the start of the round of 16, a player can be registered inaccordance with Paragraph 44.01 to Paragraph 44.04.   44.01 For all matches from the start of the round of 16, a club may register a maximumof  three  new  eligible  players  for  the  remaining  matches  in  the  currentcompetition. Such registration must be completed by 2 February 2016 (24.00CET)at the latest. This deadline cannot be extended.  44.02 One  player  from  the  above  quota  of  three  who  has  been  fielded  in  a  UEFA  clubcompetition  group  stage  match  for  another  club  in  the  current  season  mayexceptionally be registered, provided that the player has not been fielded: a. in the same competition for another club; or b. for another club that is currently in the same competition.   After reading through the rule book, he wouldn't be cup tied by the qualifiers. Only by the competition proper. I think. This used to be a black and white rule."

reddevils,3d6521,Unalaq,6,Mon Jul 13 20:58:09 2015 UTC,I think both are correct because it's a german name. 'shnee-der-lan' is the french pronunciation and 'shny-der-lin' is the german. Most people in england use the german pronunciation

reddevils,3d6521,ny-batteri,2,Mon Jul 13 21:45:06 2015 UTC,"SniGGHHK-der :/ I can see how that would be confusing!   It's more to draw attention to the fact that anglophones generally pronounce Dutch incorrectly, and in particular the Sch- sound from German tends to turn up quite a bit, which is ironic considering that Schveningen was used as a shibboleth by the Dutch to identify Germans during the Second World War.  In the same way, the Dutch 'van' tends to be pronounced 'vaaaan', and names like Blind pronounced 'Bliind'. Nothing is as annoying as Janmaat though - 'Yaaaanmat'. There are two syllables, and one conveniently has more vowels so you know to stress them, and still people insist on pronouncing it the opposite way round!"

reddevils,3d67a8,Apollo_D,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:42:08 2015 UTC,I'd love to see him at united. He's a team player too
reddevils,3d67a8,uncreddevil,7,Mon Jul 13 23:44:45 2015 UTC,"Saido Berahino- I think he's going to come good next year and be massive for west brom. He seems like a good, classy kid with decent pace and finishing that could develop well!"
reddevils,3d67a8,slaystation25,8,Mon Jul 13 21:15:57 2015 UTC,"Not with that agent. Don't want a shitstorm at United, and you don't want to aggravate Van Gaal with nonsense like that. He'll end up making Aidy Ward see the white light.  EDIT: Seems like Berahino has split up with Aidy Ward. Wise decision."
reddevils,3d67a8,theawesomeoney,4,Mon Jul 13 21:20:02 2015 UTC,Damn it Berahino stop splitting up from yourself.
reddevils,3d67a8,slaystation25,2,Mon Jul 13 21:27:18 2015 UTC,Oops.
reddevils,3d67a8,kelevr4,2,Mon Jul 13 21:28:54 2015 UTC,I would love to buy him before he is a £20m+ player but he probably isn't quite ready and will be too ready after this season.  He looks a tremendous talent
reddevils,3d67a8,uncreddevil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:06:39 2015 UTC,Oh he is fantastic- pacy and has a good eye for finishing.  His hold up play is lacking but that will come.  I think Wilson is the better overall talent but he is a risky yet shrewd signing prospect.
reddevils,3d67a8,YageWilkes,2,Thu Jul 16 20:33:49 2015 UTC,He is a great prospect. But we do have a few waiting from our under 21s who are right next to him in terms of ability.
reddevils,3d67a8,Allard1994,0,Mon Jul 13 21:22:46 2015 UTC,Lacazette?
reddevils,3d67a8,YageWilkes,2,Mon Jul 13 21:44:45 2015 UTC,"Aren't Liverpool into him ? Reportedly, in to talks already!!"
reddevils,3d67a8,wimmywamwamwozzal,9,Mon Jul 13 21:48:24 2015 UTC,"I dont see why Lacazette would go to Liverpool. Olympique Lyon have CL if I'm not mistaken and he's a starter. Also, he's French in France.. if that makes sense."
reddevils,3d67a8,pratnala,6,Mon Jul 13 22:14:44 2015 UTC,Rumour I read today is Aresnal are into him at the moment

reddevils,3d4j4m,-Zenith-,2,Mon Jul 13 13:52:33 2015 UTC,"He had his problems with hair, got a transplant and I'm sure he treats them as well as possible. Also Rooney doesn't appear like a type of person that cares about his looks very much."
reddevils,3d4j4m,Keiano,3,Mon Jul 13 13:55:52 2015 UTC,"Any man that gets a hair transplant cares about his looks too much. I don't blame him, he's constantly being filmed and photographed."
reddevils,3d4j4m,googly__moogly,5,Mon Jul 13 14:33:38 2015 UTC,"He looks like he has been in that suit for many many seasons, it was meant to be."
reddevils,3d4j4m,Entrepreneur_Girl,7,Mon Jul 13 13:48:14 2015 UTC,After 17 years of seeing him in the Bavarian colors it still is hard to believe he now wears United colors. This is the best transfer period in a long time for United.
