AirBrawl,3do3c1,Gravityx100,4,Fri Jul 17 21:14:40 2015 UTC,"I'm very, very worried that a ranking system would promote bad behavior and change the attitude of the player base.  In one of the first matches I played on Stronghold on its release day, there was a player who was dropping nets and mines in front of spawn points to get free kills.  They won that match by a landslide because of their cheap tactics.  I became toxic about it very quickly, to the point where I wasn't having fun playing the game during that session.  I also avoid that player like the plague after they displayed an incredibly negative attitude towards other players criticizing that technique.  The thing I love about Air Brawl is that there's not a huge competitive aspect - it's a game where you can enjoy shooting people down as well as being shot down yourself because the consequences are minimal.  If you lose a game, your rank doesn't go down.  You don't have an epeen measuring competition, which is a great way of approaching the game casually.  This is why an overarching XP system worries me - it promotes an attitude that I worry will convince people to actively tryhard.  Mechanics that promote bad behavior change the way people play the game.  We're a great community precisely because the game treats failure as a minor nuisance rather than a failure with serious implications for one's overarching rank."
AirBrawl,3do3c1,TheDudishSFW,5,Mon Jul 20 15:42:39 2015 UTC,"The only way I got marginally good was by getting killed a lot. First it comes out of nowhere, and you get frustrated and wonder how the fuck they're doing it. Then you see it happen to someone else. You notice that people slow down before the kill for additional maneuverability, or overtake their opponent from the side while firing fast. You learn to take others down in specific ways, using the weapons you started out with, figuring out which weapons suit your play style, or jumping on the bandwagon of whatever build is popular right now (for a while it was Witch Doctor/Darts/Soul Catcher, then SharpShooter/DMR/Sniper, now Fatbird/Shotgun/Stickies is big (which I like to claim credit for because I've been rockin' it since my first day), but CyberPriest is nipping at its heels on some of the more open maps).  I think what makes the game is sportsmanship. Congratulating people when they get good kills, letting them know how they could do better. I got killed by a guy who was using Fatbird/Shotgun/Stickies who got me by chasing me and hitting me with Shotgun once, getting a bunch of stickies on me, and then waiting to hit me with shotgun again. I told him he could have detonated his stickies and destroyed my remaining health. It would've been a quicker kill, he could have moved on. He said he was waiting for me to get near a wall. If I wanted to dominate all the time, I could have told him that's a great strategy, keep at that, and hoped he never realized he could be getting more kills. But I'd rather be challenged. I'd rather see more Mr. Neckties, more iLUVponies, more Kais, more AshBlasters, more people who challenge me and make my build look like it's made of TinkerToys, and we're not going to get there separating the newbies from the veterans. We just have to teach them and maintain a game culture of good sportsmanship and bringing people up to speed."
AirBrawl,3do3c1,coggro,2,Sat Jul 18 15:18:22 2015 UTC,I agree with almost everything you said.  The only thing I don't agree on is Shotgun and Stickies are a popular build. OBVIOUSLY SHOTGUN AND BARRELS ARE MORE SUPERIOR!!!  :T   <3 barrels

I do think your right, if this game keeps it's fantastic community, that will be the thing keeping me and many other players coming back.  Unfortunately, its far too easy for unsportsmanlike players to join the community and ruin someone's experience of the game. Heck, I have met players who do nothing but complain about the weapons and harass people in the chat for killing them too quickly.  I just hope that mean players don't become a big part of the community.  Edit: You might be right, ranks could split up the community, but that is why you would also have unranked servers."
AirBrawl,3do3c1,nudemanonbike,2,Sat Jul 18 18:58:08 2015 UTC,"I am personally against ranking. Skullgirls for the PS3 featured ranking, and due to its very small player base, it actually restricted the number of games that you can get into. HAWKEN currently has the same issue, you have to use the server browser or else you won't get to go into a match.   It's good in bigger communities, but I caution you from adding it if your game is too small."
AirBrawl,3do3c1,GoPlayTagPro,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I have always used server browser in almost every game.

But I don't think Airbrawl players would do something like that, we are better than that as a community.      An xp system would actually be pretty cool. But only if you could level up and unlock skins for your planes. Unlocking upgrades would unlevel the playing field too much."

AirBrawl,3dfzn9,OneRandomCatFact,6,Thu Jul 16 06:14:17 2015 UTC,"This game is not meant for a joystick because it involves tight rotations and quick movements in an arcade-y way. Keyboard and mouse are he best way to go, however, wilnyl did say he would add support soon."
AirBrawl,3dfzn9,callmebrick,4,Thu Jul 16 11:20:04 2015 UTC,"I think you'll be at a disadvantage. Like /u/OneRandomCatFact said, it's an arcade dogfighter, not a flight simulator. Gravity doesn't really affect your airplane unless you are going really slow, and stalling is basically nonexistent. I run out of mousepad a lot, but can't up the sensitivity because I'll miss my shots. You'd be slamming your stick all over the place."
AirBrawl,3dfzn9,zavalava,2,Thu Jul 16 12:22:29 2015 UTC,I've done some smooth flying on BF4 with my joystick but the Arcade style of flying could definitely pose a problem. I'll probably wait till it gets full support and give it a try. Thanks for the feedback. It looks pretty fun
AirBrawl,3dfzn9,SirEngland,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:27:39 2015 UTC,"The game does have controller support*. I've been using Logitech F310 gamepad all yesterday. If you are used to a flight stick or console controllers wait for some more improvements. You will be at equal and/or at a disadvantage using a controller. However, using a controller allows for smoother turns, but aiming is at best average (cause it's a game controller not a mouse). I was getting tired moving my mouse all over the place to do loops so I bought a gamepad. Currently looking at mapping the buttons, some of the abilities are not present with the game using a gamepad by default such as speed up.    It's limited but fully functional with smooth turns, yaws, and loops."

AirBrawl,3deqql,Highsight,6,Wed Jul 15 18:20:22 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with any XP system in Air Brawl. I think any leveling system takes away from the competitiveness of a game, if the only way to get better/more weapons is to play and gain XP, then all of the good players have what the new and bad players don't. This makes it feel like a grind.   I am much more of a fan of CSGO, where the only 'levels' are the ranks you get from being good at the game, which makes you play with other people your skill level (I'm excluding the new XP system that was introduced, as it only gives to drops).  The only real levels I could like would be in a competitive mode like CSGO, where it just places you in an appropriate skill group."
AirBrawl,3deqql,mrRobertman,2,Thu Jul 16 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"A completely legitimate viewpoint. What if the XP you spend only unlocked aesthetic things such as skins, or different weapon/projectile models?"

AirBrawl,3deqql,SirEngland,3,Thu Jul 16 20:45:49 2015 UTC,"I agree on a XP system, but I don't want a stupid World of Planes progression system. I like to grind a little, but not grind for hours.   Note XP has to count for something and unlock something for it to be worth anything. Don't add a XP system if you are not adding a rank system.  I would love to see these 4 metrics for the rank/xp system for online. Flight time (how long have I've been playing), kills, flight tricks, and team play. Flight time is yet to be tapped by any game and this will be a game changer, if I suck but played a lot I'm not left out of ranking up!"
AirBrawl,3deqql,SirEngland,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:59:05 2015 UTC,"Rankings would absolutely be welcome imo!

As for keeping people hooked? It's a great community so far, and everyone's friendly. Perhaps the only thing at the moment is amount of people playing, but that's sure to increase."

AirBrawl,3da58a,yangxiaodong,8,Tue Jul 14 18:13:28 2015 UTC,"Counterplay  There are a select few weapons that are going to be tricky to balance mainly because they have no real counterplay.  The best example of these weapons are ones that affect movement speed.  In Air Brawl, movement is life, and if you are stopped for any reason, you are most likely dead.  Despite that, certain weapons such as the Holy Swords, are designed specifically to stop you in your tracks.  The idea of weapons that effect movement isn't necessarily a bad one by any stretch, but there NEEDS TO BE COUNTERPLAY!  I think the best example of a weapon in the game that effects movement, but still has counterplay is Magnetize.  Magnetize can be completely deadly if used in the right situation, however, if a player knows they are going against an enemy using Magnetize, they are able to course correct, and potentially survive if they can fly well enough.  I'd recommend checking out this excellent video by Extra Credits on the subject. It shows some great examples on what to, and not to do to balance your game in such a way."

AirBrawl,3da58a,SirEngland,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:21:42 2015 UTC,"This! This is why I'm ready to stop playing the game, at least until it's finished the development cycle. Balance complaints are also tied to this. There's no way to save yourself from shotgun or sticky blasts or any host of other weapons that affect movement, and the penalty for hitting things is far too extreme for a dogfighter that has weapons that change how a victim flies. With the advent of Stronghold, this is all the more apparent. Weapon balance can be tweaked all we want (much of which is reactionary and situational, favoring experiences on Park and Sand until now), but at some point there needs to be some serious design time and ideas put into counterplay other than better piloting, grav bombs, and nets. When weapons are favored on a map, or even certain parts of a map, they're very heavily favored, and render everything else ineffective.  I've been saying for weeks now that the game has an identity crisis -- it's built almost like a racer and handles extremely well, but combat is...well, what is it? A dogfighter with very low kill times? Best when there are few people on a server? What's the point of huge, complex maps then? Play/counterplay is best seen with a lot of people flying in tighter maps, as they generate a sense of flow in the air that small 2v2s simply can't, especially with skilled pilots flying against each other in the latter scenario. It's fast and looks badass, sure, but good pilots can wipe each other out too quickly to pull off any maneuvers that might give one or the other the upper hand. I'm not sure I understand the direction Air Brawl is taking from a combat standpoint.  I love the game -- I'm almost 45 hours deep and would like to think I'm a decent pilot -- but there are some pretty major issues with it that are frustrating to newbies and don't make much sense as a vet. I wouldn't be surprised if there were a major outcry against shotguns (again) and stickies as a reaction to playing against them on stronghold.  That rambled a bit...point being, ultimately, is that Air Brawl needs some major revisions to combat design -- maps need to be smaller and facilitate flow from battle to battle from 4 players all the way up to 12, and weapon physics and piloting penalties should be revised and hopefully reduced."
AirBrawl,3da58a,MrNecktie,0,Wed Jul 15 01:10:08 2015 UTC,I've been complaining about the lack of counterplay for a while. This was a post I made a while back that you might find useful as well: Counterplay
AirBrawl,3da58a,ShadowRaven6,4,Mon Jul 20 06:44:34 2015 UTC,"After buying the full game 4 pack! Awesome game gonna spent at least 30 minutes on it everyday and try for some tourneys.   It's missing a mini-map to help show where my allies are and ""possible"" enemy sightings. Really frustrating flying towards someone to only realize ""hey you are on my team"".  The demo needs to be updated with the purchasable version until release, but limited to only offline mode with 1 map, and 2 planes. This allows potential players to see the current progress of this game. Comparing the demo to new version it's night and day at the moment.    That is my rant, love the game, fits into my crimson skies fix.  EDIT: I need to get better at flying.lol"
AirBrawl,3da58a,SirEngland,2,Wed Jul 15 16:06:25 2015 UTC,"In my experience, minimaps don't help at all with these sorts of games. Usually they cover too much area and have no good, comprehendible at a glance way of showing altitude. Plus the maps are small enough that i feel like it's not too necessary. That being said, i would like a slightly larger onscreen indicator or box or something around teammates. The one we have is a bit too small and doesn't scale well with distance."

AirBrawl,3d8us3,ashishvp,2,Tue Jul 14 12:17:33 2015 UTC,"I always liked VIP in other games, as it creates a really chaotic atmosphere.  I see what you're saying about a minimum player limit.  I see it really scaling well with more people.  The issue I have is that I'm not seeing anything bigger than 8 players normally, and the player count is constantly fluctuating as the game is finding a larger player base.  In terms of level design, I think it'd work out great.  I can imagine people sneaking around to try and get the jump on the VIP in levels like Neon, and I can see the VIP camping in the ships in Harbor and behind the buildings in Park, and it'd make for some interesting gameplay on Sand because of the level's lack of cover towards the team's spawn points.  From what I'm seeing from Stronghold, I wouldn't be surprised of people just charged in headfirst to the VIP there.  Honestly, I'm thinking areas with a lot of intricacy would play better, as there's a lot more sneaking up on the VIP, getting in close and letting loose, and less of a tendency for players to just spam Sniper, which I'd be concerned with in more open levels.  On a side note, what would you think about a VIP health boost?  Perhaps they get a little more to survive the other team's onslaught?  I think that'd have to go through testing.  There are two issues I see with VIP, though.  One issue I have is that in Air Brawl, I'm not seeing a lot of zone control.  People have a bit more control over their team's spawn point, but people branch out towards the rest of the map really quickly, and there's no turtling up for the VIP.  So it's not exactly a charge on the stronghold, more of a charge directly for ""the thing.""  The other issue I see is that VIP would promote running away from enemies rather than charging towards them.  Don't get me wrong, I love a chase sequence, but I'm concerned that if the defense is doing their job, the game gets boring for the VIP.  Personally, I don't expect the VIP to survive long enough against the other team's onslaught to actually get bored, but it's something to think about."

AirBrawl,3d4m6k,Snypervash,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:33:51 2015 UTC,I'm guessing this game has a CTF style game type but does it have a race/checkpoints type of game? That seems like it would work pretty well with the maneuvering and whatnot.

AirBrawl,3d89gj,Witty__Username,4,Tue Jul 14 07:40:37 2015 UTC,After adding controller support we realised that the game really needs to be played with a mouse and key board. It plays a lot more like an fps than a flight sim. You really need the precise movement of a mouse. Joystick support is a very low priority at the moment
AirBrawl,3d89gj,Wilnyl,2,Tue Jul 14 08:05:27 2015 UTC,"ahh dang, thanks for answering!"
AirBrawl,3d89gj,Coconut_Twister,2,Tue Jul 14 08:13:02 2015 UTC,I'm doing quite well with a ps4 controller! I haven't figured out the best way to keybind alt to the controller yet though.

AirBrawl,3d5fss,SirEngland,4,Mon Jul 13 17:49:51 2015 UTC,"Possibly in the future. Wilnyl plans to add workshop shop support for maps.  There aren't many servers, but if you join the TeamSpeak, we'll gladly play. There are weekly tournaments too.  Never played with controller, but a mouse is perfect. For the stunts and stuff.  We have MLAB (Major League Air Brawl, /r/MLAB), with teams for competitive matches.  Uh... I'm not sure I understand. A google search didn't really help me there.  Not sure if co-op would fit here...  It's a possibility. Because right now if we old players join a server with new players, well... It's not really balanced. So yeah, something for balance.  The crosshair? Nope.  /u/Wilnyl, everything correct?"
AirBrawl,3d5fss,Its-M4RC05,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:13:58 2015 UTC,"On the convoy/bomber support type gameplay, it would be like the following description. One team has to protect a massive ship(s) that has to get from point A to point B or last for a set amount of time in the air without being shot down in flames by the opposing team. The bomber/convoy has some guns that target the opposing team players, but nothing super damaging.   I wonder if that'll change later on about the crosshair, many pilots would most likely like a customization of their crosshair.   Thanks for the answers, I'll look at MLAB. I'm very tempted to get the four pack, playing with a friend this evening the demo."
AirBrawl,3d5fss,yangxiaodong,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:50:52 2015 UTC,"Oh, we've had suggestions for that. It will most likely be added.  Although changing the crosshair can be good, some weapons (like the Elder's Blast) have different ones, so you would need to change more than. But that's not much of a problem."

AirBrawl,3d1ydu,Oligatormusic,6,Sun Jul 12 21:35:45 2015 UTC,"I suggest you start using the Fatbird with the Air Cannon secondary. It basically does everything you described without the need for a new plane/mechanic.  Alt-fire with the AC pulls planes towards you, but if aimed at or near a wall, structure or whatever, you pull yourself towards that surface. If you can chain these pulls, you can maintain a much higher speed than normal cruise making it a great CTF runner. However, with it's use comes a big risk. One small misfire and you're splattered on the wall"

The map that Wilnyl is currently working on is basically what you suggested, all inside and very small  As for the server settings, I expect they will be implemented at some point, but right now Wilnyl is working more on expanding the core game, things like that will come later"
AirBrawl,3cugca,coggro,12,Fri Jul 10 21:40:16 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Snipe's big killer is the knockback whenever I'm up against it, not the damage. If you learn to evade well, following shots have a significantly lowered chance of hitting because it's a line of effect, not an area. DMR fires quickly because it's not auto-fire, so its ROF is determined by how quickly the player clicks/presses fire. But once again, line of affect: no area. People dislike DMR for the same reason they dislike Shotgun: the weapon itself requires multiple hits to kill (2 for shotgun unless it's up against a Viking, however many for DMR I don't play that plane much), but you can usually get the requisite shots off in a short span of time because it's only dependent on your click speed. Sharpshooter definitely doesn't need a health nerf, if I can get them in the shotgun sight long enough to kick off both shots, they're done.   It's a difficult problem to solve. The shotgun and DMR builds of these planes requires that click-based ROF to get kills, yet I get complaints about shotgun kills when I'm performing well. If I had to, though, I'd argue that they're not more powerful than the super-fast ROF on the Witch Doctor's darts (especially if you're pinned by the Soul Catcher), the debilitating damage and stop you get from Swords on the Cyber Priest, or the numerous weapons that I don't genuinely believe are OP but just loathe on the Elder because they kill me pretty often (Kai, you magnificent bastard...).  Fact of the matter is that the game's not in official releases, and I'm content with the current balance and more interested in additional maps and game modes. I wish the Fatbird had an alternate special because the net doesn't usually serve me that great, but I imagine the additional slots will fill up as development continues.  Idk. This should have been shorter, but I don't feel like editing. Vote as you will."
AirBrawl,3cugca,sayaks,4,Fri Jul 10 22:29:27 2015 UTC,"i always play DMR/snipe and i always get complaints, but the complaints also only come when i play with DMR/snipe, when others do it they don't complain. I know this because i play other planes sometimes. I assume it's just because I'm pretty good with the DMR/snipe. and that it's annoying to play against someone who is good with DMR/snipe, then again that's true with all weapon combinations. I know that Yosepi really annoys me with how good he is with his Elder. I have played some good shotgunners and that is annoying. I think this is because they can push me around so much. Snipers knockback, shotguns knockback, air cannons push/pull, entagles freezing of a plane. I take this annoyance and use it as encouragement, but i can definitely see that people become frustrated by it.  The reason, i believe, that people are more annoyed with the DMR/snipe than the other ones is that people don't understand why they got killed. Just flying close to a wall and BAM, dead. Then they see they were killed by a snipe and assume it's OP and move to that plane/combo. I don't think that DMR is inherently better than the two other options, but considering its range it fits with Snipe and is sort of a natural fit to that. I don't know where i was going with this but decided to weigh in anyway.  Also with the DMR i don't actually know how many shots to kill people, i just know that 10 kills anyone, 1 snipe + 2 DMR for sharp shooter, 2 snipes and a couple DMR for viking rest are within that."

It's always interesting to see those kinds of statistics.  I remember sitting in the library in High School (I was always the popular one ofc) looking through my Halo 3 stats on the online portal, examining them and looking for ways to improve my gameplay from that.  Did you ever play Star Wars Battlefront II?  That game had a number of statistics involved on multiple screens, and actually had ""awards"" given out at the end of the match based on your performance."

B) They are nowhere near the large threat you see they are if you learn to counter them effectively.  When facing Sharpshooters, stay in within the buildings, avoid straight lines and routes and don't be scared to get close and rush them in areas with limited spacing. People who play that class, including me, will always be surprised when someone lashes out at them as they expect you to stay at longer ranges where they can pick you off."

AirBrawl,3crqin,ViciousLooRoll,3,Fri Jul 10 06:56:25 2015 UTC,"The Death Star's trenches have come up as an idea a few times in the teamspeak, if it was to be made to look like these trenches it would have to be a community made map."
AirBrawl,3crqin,coggro,3,Fri Jul 10 06:23:19 2015 UTC,I'm sure that will happen eventually but it doesn't necessarily have to be a trench run.
AirBrawl,3cq66a,wingzing,21,Thu Jul 9 21:56:40 2015 UTC,Are you sure it's suicide? I usually commit suicide by accident trying evade any fire.   I'm not good
AirBrawl,3cq66a,morla74,18,Thu Jul 9 23:13:39 2015 UTC,"But if you're evading and commit suicide because of it, shouldn't the credit go to the people that were suppressing you?"
AirBrawl,3cq66a,Vikingboy9,17,Fri Jul 10 06:24:13 2015 UTC,"I have seen multiple pilots just commit suicide, since the tracer does no damage, It gets pretty annoying"
AirBrawl,3cq66a,Dreznych,3,Thu Jul 9 21:57:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, I've seen this too"
AirBrawl,3cq66a,Wilnyl,38,Thu Jul 9 21:58:42 2015 UTC,Good idea! Adding this

AirBrawl,3cozdl,Arduous_Armadillo,5,Thu Jul 9 19:16:23 2015 UTC,"Hey Wil, I hate to sound naggy, but have you given a look into the SegFault issue that prevents some of us Linux users from playing the game? It crashes on startup, so I haven't even been able to really do anything with this awesome looking game yet :l  There's been a few bug reports  here  and here  I and someone else tried running the program through gdb, but it didn't really reveal anything too enlightening (at least not to us)"
AirBrawl,3cozdl,firehead818,3,Thu Jul 9 22:09:06 2015 UTC,"The tutorial should adapt to your control changes.  If I set mouse yaw, it should say that in the tutorial. Same goes with all the other keys."
AirBrawl,3cozdl,RaGeQ2,3,Thu Jul 9 19:14:39 2015 UTC,Could you please nerf the Elder and more specifically the vine whip and magnetize combo. They both have way to big reach and has way to fast fire rate on the vine whip for the amount of damage it dishes out. You could literally just do circles and hold your primary and still be able to hit anyone while still being able to kill the plane with just nearly 3-4 hits and you can swing twice each second so basically taking down you enemy in just 2 seconds! It's just ridiculous...
AirBrawl,3cozdl,intoxbodmansvs,2,Thu Jul 9 22:51:46 2015 UTC,wine whip   FTFY
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Sinfusion,4,Fri Jul 10 13:42:48 2015 UTC,Magnetise needs balancing as the radius of it means it tags way too many kills either that or make the lasting effect a little shorter as it gets kills like 10-15 secs after being hit by one if you crash...
AirBrawl,3cozdl,albinobluesheep,5,Thu Jul 9 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the feedback! Just to clear it up, all types of damage only gives you the kill if the enemy dies withing 5 seconds."
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Apoxyi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:13:12 2015 UTC,Was there an update yesterday (or maybe the day before?) as well? I had to update before I could play the other day.
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Yosepi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"Hey Wilnyl this game is awesome just got it three days ago, the only things that bug is that the adaptive strike imo (and i've heard other's talk about it) is really unviable.  The other thing is the tether bug after weapon switch in gungame as /u/yosenpai also said."
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Apoxyi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:28:51 2015 UTC,"Wait you don't think adaptive strike is ever worth taking?  Also my username is /u/yosepi , Runi changed it :("
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Yosepi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"No, i feel that it's does close to no damage (i might just be shit at the game, who knows) and for a chargeable, weapon it also feels weird that i can't just free-fire it as a shotgun.  However i remember playing a gungame that was bugged so everyone had adaptive strike and sunray mines, wich lead to people just talking in chat, and there alot of the people said that the adaptive strike is bad/shit/unviable you name it, so i'm not the only one."
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Apoxyi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:14:23 2015 UTC,"You can use it as a shotgun, it does slightly less total damage than a shotgun  Also, I usually use adaptive strike and I think if anything it's still overpowered. I can normally win a game easily using it"
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Yosepi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:18:38 2015 UTC,"For me i need to charge it a bit to use it as a shotgun, i can't just click the mouse and shoot it as a shotgun."
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Apoxyi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:34:37 2015 UTC,"You definitely can fire it as a shotgun,  I just tested it"
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Yosepi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:32:56 2015 UTC,"Yea i see, just remember it not being that way, but even though that's the case would you rather pick adaptiver over vine whip? I wouldn't."
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Apoxyi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:37:24 2015 UTC,"I run adaptive/entangle so I usually hit people then root them, then get the last hits and they can't do anything  Adaptive can also kill sharpshooters and cyber priests with 1 volley, and entangling several people for a multi kill doesn't work as well with vine whip"
AirBrawl,3cozdl,that_c00l_kid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:40:09 2015 UTC,"Yea i see, will probably try it out again then."
AirBrawl,3cozdl,that_c00l_kid,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:45:22 2015 UTC,"There used to be a bug where I would use the Steam overlay, in the respawn menu, and the cursor would stay in the middle of the screen.  I found no fix, and have to reinstall the game :/"
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Yosepi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:54:25 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm gonna have to work on that bug. A work around is pressing space to spawn. Doing that should remove the bug.
AirBrawl,3cozdl,Apoxyi,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:52:17 2015 UTC,I'll try it! Thanks!
AirBrawl,3coit2,Sinfusion,9,Thu Jul 9 14:40:39 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a pretty crappy hack, the regular shotgun fires 10 shots instantly.      Joking aside, that would really a be a good adition."
AirBrawl,3coit2,Wilnyl,2,Thu Jul 9 14:52:53 2015 UTC,"Let me put this way, He fired 5x 10 shots - That better? :P  Also you're the dev! Make the addition! (If You can ofcourse we still love you either way)"
AirBrawl,3coit2,Wilnyl,6,Thu Jul 9 15:01:18 2015 UTC,Thats better :P     Being a currently single dev I really have to prioritize what I want to add to the game. I'm almost done with a new map which I should be able to release in a couple of days. But some time after that I should be able to implement a vote kick/ban.
AirBrawl,3coit2,Yosepi,5,Thu Jul 9 15:45:58 2015 UTC,"You could maybe redo the menus, so you can click on someone's name and get to their steam profile  That way you can add a kick function there, and if you add voice chat or anything in the future you could add a mute there"
AirBrawl,3coit2,Wilnyl,2,Thu Jul 9 15:50:19 2015 UTC,There's a couple bugs I've noticed recently. Should I PM you or make a post when I discover them?
AirBrawl,3coit2,Spore2012,3,Thu Jul 9 15:52:29 2015 UTC,Thanks! A pm would work well!
AirBrawl,3coit2,sharktopuskracken,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:22:13 2015 UTC,"I dunno if this is a good idea, same with conceding options in team formats.   You end up with more problems from people abusing these things to grief people or whatever for selfish reasons.  Probably best to just have a report function."
AirBrawl,3coit2,sharktopuskracken,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:32:33 2015 UTC,Then that'd require admins more than just Wil himself which in turn could also be abused
AirBrawl,3cmt2y,Whocares0164,4,Thu Jul 9 03:09:46 2015 UTC,"I'm still surprised I lived that shot. My plane was going at full burn and at full health when it cleared the corner -- if I hit the ground, it was at a shallow enough angle that it didn't draw much health.  Not having used the anchor much, I'm unsure what buff it could actually use, but a cooldown reduction feels like it might be helpful. They're hard shots to make to begin with and waiting for a long reload is the worst."
AirBrawl,3cmt2y,MrNecktie,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:25:24 2015 UTC,"I am sorry I rage quit after that shot, you are very nice and extremely skilled at Air Brawl."
AirBrawl,3cmt2y,Wilnyl,3,Thu Jul 9 20:27:30 2015 UTC,Yeah I think that might a good idea
AirBrawl,3cmt2y,JHeim286,3,Thu Jul 9 09:36:50 2015 UTC,You're awesome
AirBrawl,3cmt2y,Stumpless,2,Thu Jul 9 13:54:51 2015 UTC,"I remember the early days where the thing had little to no cooldown, that was hilariously fun."
AirBrawl,3cmt2y,Wilnyl,2,Thu Jul 9 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"It was the only thing I used in the first map, I am very happy right now."
AirBrawl,3cmt2y,ArkEneru,2,Thu Jul 9 20:22:02 2015 UTC,Yes! Thank you so much Wilnyl!
AirBrawl,3cmt2y,Wilnyl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:22:56 2015 UTC,I made the hitbox of the harpoon a bit bigger making it a bit easier to hit with. I also made it so the the target gets damaged over time while anchored

AirBrawl,3ckals,bitofabyte,2,Wed Jul 8 18:36:05 2015 UTC,Yeah I'd love to have a chance to win the game via the demo...
AirBrawl,3ckals,metalmine,2,Thu Jul 9 03:06:09 2015 UTC,I made a slight change   There will also be 1 key given out to 2 people without the game that showed up.

AirBrawl,3cfz9o,firehead818,6,Tue Jul 7 16:48:09 2015 UTC,"I've found that using A and D to steer keeps me more in control and frees up my mouse for aiming. I'm still not very good, but I don't crash as much."
AirBrawl,3cfz9o,callmebrick,5,Tue Jul 7 16:56:29 2015 UTC,"I changed to mouse yaw pretty quickly as I mostly play first person shooters, so I understand what you mean."
AirBrawl,3cfz9o,DrFegelein,3,Tue Jul 7 16:58:34 2015 UTC,I fly aircraft IRL and I did the same thing (even though it feels more natural to have pitch and roll on the same control [be it a control column or a mouse] and yaw as a separate one [pedals IRL]) because it's so much easier to aim.
AirBrawl,3cfz9o,callmebrick,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:31:58 2015 UTC,"I'll have to try that, thanks."
AirBrawl,3cfz9o,crilen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:35:30 2015 UTC,"Mouse to the left/right, then mouse down.  Super turns."
AirBrawl,3cfz9o,callmebrick,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:00:09 2015 UTC,"I did that, and do it when I need to turn really hard, but I found it was too much for most turns as I'd get into a vicious cycle of oversteering and over correcting."
AirBrawl,3cfz9o,crilen,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:34:05 2015 UTC,That just takes practice.
AirBrawl,3cfz9o,HyFix,3,Tue Jul 7 21:10:58 2015 UTC,I'm sure someone somewhere will point out that you can't play because you're a dog.

AirBrawl,3cjgz7,Esparno,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:31:34 2015 UTC,You have a joystick or controller connected that is sending input.  EDIT: And after actually reading your post it turns out I'm right!  Woohoo!
AirBrawl,3cjct9,SandwichGuardian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:51:20 2015 UTC,"The game is usually fine with large ping, but you might have some trouble. Right now user hosted servers are not an option, but they are coming soon."
AirBrawl,3cixym,Combustable-Lemons,5,Wed Jul 8 07:18:57 2015 UTC,"Just practice, that's all it requires  Try switching to mouse yaw, messing with the sensitivity  Honestly it's all about practice, find something comfortable and then just play"
AirBrawl,3cixym,Yosepi,2,Wed Jul 8 11:38:35 2015 UTC,"I know a lot of people change left/right mouse to yaw but I say stick with the stock settings. After you get the hang of it, it's incredibly easy to make sudden turns and crazy maneuvers. Consider the mouse the ""joystick"" the pilot uses and a/d your tail rudder control. A lot of times, a/d shouldn't really come into the equation. Make your lefts and rights by turning the plane sideways and pulling the nose in the direction you want to go."
AirBrawl,3cixym,JamminJim,3,Wed Jul 8 16:02:59 2015 UTC,"yeah, I agree, everyone enabling mouse Yaw isn't going to be able to make crazy avoidance maneuvers. It makes aiming easier, but it has a much lower ceiling in terms of how skillful your flying can be, IMHO."
AirBrawl,3cixym,albinobluesheep,2,Thu Jul 9 17:44:29 2015 UTC,"You can't expect to even follow and kill someone who has the normal controls mastered. Then again, some people to well with unorthodox controls. Once you get the coordination down, aiming with the normal controls is waaaaay easier."
AirBrawl,3cixym,JamminJim,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:01:27 2015 UTC,"With high X sensitivity, mouse yaw can be just as responsive. The game is mostly about killing, so it's definitely worth the tradeoff in my opinion."

It will freeze in the load out menu, and/or it will freeze in the first 5 seconds of flight. The only way I have managed to fix it is to close the game and reopen it again . interestingly enough, the game does not become unresponsive during this. I just have to alt+tab out of the game and close it from the task bar.

AirBrawl,3cc8h7,Cowgus,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:02:16 2015 UTC,"i don't know how the game works as i don't own it, but something that would probably be cool could be dedicated servers so people can host on different machines than their own (also so they're not targeted by a mad player DDoSing or something, quite unlikely to happen, but just an example)"
AirBrawl,3cc8h7,nemaides,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"Well the game has its own dedicated servers. When you click host, you aren't really hosting, you are just opening a room on a large server in your region, so in theory, you are running a server on another machine. There is no advantage or penalty to therefore be 'hosting' a server."
AirBrawl,3cc8h7,Cowgus,0,Tue Jul 7 06:47:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with the way Unity (the engine on which the game was programmed with) Networking System works but I believe it only can make servers when the game is on, making it hard to make a client only application for the server."
AirBrawl,3cc8h7,Netux055,2,Tue Jul 7 02:39:20 2015 UTC,"You can actually run dedicated servers using it, lots of games have in the past. They do this by 'running' the game but without rendering any of the graphics and just hosting it through a dialogue  box, therefore it only impacts your cpu which is rarely fully utilised anyway."
AirBrawl,3c7d7w,Wilnyl,18,Sun Jul 5 15:58:24 2015 UTC,You should work on a bots or SP mode after this map so people can have fun without needing to be online. Another cool idea would be to find a way to allow local splitscreen. Since you're using Unity I think that wouldn't be impossible to go for.
AirBrawl,3c7d7w,Dwood15,3,Sun Jul 5 15:59:10 2015 UTC,"I think local splitscreen would be pretty damned difficult, especially with the amount of controls the mouse is used for."

AirBrawl,3c7d7w,menneske2,2,Sun Jul 5 21:56:45 2015 UTC,I mostly enjoy the modelling. Texturing is usually not as fun so I usually just put on some netflix while doing it.

AirBrawl,3bhe4r,cgajkula,10,Mon Jun 29 06:11:18 2015 UTC,As long as they're trick/obstacle courses that both challenge your flying ability and give you a tour of the maps. Sounds like a good way to increase overall player skill by making training competitive and fun.
AirBrawl,3bhe4r,Lurking4Answers,3,Mon Jun 29 08:16:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah! I always have the mental image of having one ring in that small hole on the archways Harbor, and another directly below the archway so you need to loop around it. It's a hard maneuver for a beginner, but it's a great way to learn."
AirBrawl,3bhe4r,1jl,2,Mon Jun 29 08:21:48 2015 UTC,"I think ring racing would be awesome. You could also do a target practice race too where you have to shoot a stationary target and then move on to the next. Would really help the single player / training. You could also combine the two. Fly through ring, shoot target, fly through ring, shoot target, fly through ring etc. Also, I cannot wait for a multiplayer race mode!"
AirBrawl,3bhe4r,1jl,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:08:10 2015 UTC,"Maybe there could be a private lobby system where you could invite just one friend and you race on a mirrored map, and when you shoot a target it puts some obstacle in the way of your opponent?"

AirBrawl,3be80x,Hawkfiend,2,Sun Jun 28 17:49:42 2015 UTC,"Many people, myself included, would rather pay once for a game and get all of its content. I would also say that no paid DLC does make the game better. Everyone gets the full experience, without having to wait for DLC to launch and then pay for it. No DLC also often simplifies modding.  Paid day 1 DLC is pure money grabbing. ""Day 1 DLC that is free and useful"" could refer to things like optional HD textures, or optional content in general (thus making it preferable to no day 1 DLC at all)."
AirBrawl,3be80x,platoandfriends,2,Sun Jun 28 17:36:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I understand your first point, it wasn't ""no paid DLC"" it was just ""no DLC"", that would include free I think, so ""no DLC"" just means the game is never expanded by the devs after launch  For your second point, what if a game has no day 1 DLC, but just has all that stuff included in the game. If devs want to get a higher rating on PCMRating, they could cut some content and release it as  free day 1 DLC, that doesn't make the game better"
AirBrawl,3be80x,Hawkfiend,0,Sun Jun 28 17:45:43 2015 UTC,"If the list says ""DLC"" and ""free DLC"" I think it is safe to assume that the ""DLC"" without ""free"" attached to it is referring to paid DLC.   If devs want to get a higher rating on PCMRating, they could cut some content and release it as free day 1 DLC, that doesn't make the game better   As I said, this would be to refer to stuff like HD textures. Things that many people would not be able to use, so it is a separate download to save space and download time for those users. In my mind, this does make the game better, as it is more flexible. If the free day one was simply chopped off content, then it would create the same problems I listed against regular DLC. I would say these problems it introduces would disqualify it from the ""useful"" part of the ""free and useful"" category.  Obviously, the system still needs more work. However, I can totally see the logic in how it is laid out now. Perhaps it needs better descriptions and more detail."
AirBrawl,3be80x,platoandfriends,2,Mon Jun 29 00:06:50 2015 UTC,"What about DLC that's designed after the game is released, on the basis of its success? There are plenty of instances where this rule doesn't make sense."

I also don't want to not bring my friends along for an experience I payed for, if they didn't get the DLC. If a game is super successful, then maybe the studio should consider releasing a new game instead of money-grabbing with DLC.  To the argument that some DLC adds a lot of content, I will point out that ""large content patches"" in this case provides the same points as no DLC. To me, this means the other tiers in the list are referring to small DLCs.  DLC still makes modding harder, as mods may have to be developed for different DLC configurations users may have."

AirBrawl,3bciz6,SirMStachio,4,Sat Jun 27 23:43:09 2015 UTC,Why do people think ten dollars is too much? It's a pretty perfect price point imo
AirBrawl,3bciz6,SuperGusta,3,Sun Jun 28 05:13:29 2015 UTC,"Balance, visibility, and TTK are almost entirely as they should be 10 bucks is an amazing price for a game with ~50-80 hours of replay value in its current state: My current playtime, double it for the time spent beta testing"
AirBrawl,3bciz6,ArkEneru,2,Sun Jun 28 02:02:31 2015 UTC,"This is actually the first time I've heard someone say that.  Can you elaborate a bit?  For example, you wouldn't agree that the prevalence of strong knockback, CC, and one-shot mechanics has a negative impact on the gameplay? Most combat at this stage is essentially assassination; there's very little actual dogfighting going on. And you don't find it troubling that the majority of players use nothing but Sharpshooter?  To me, it seems like they intended to give most weapons knockback as a sort of tactile feedback - to emphasize the fact that you've been hit. Except they judged all of the numbers wrong, and now the basic Shotgun primary can punch enemies 40 feet into a wall.  And, when I say visibility, I'm talking about the fact that chemtrails are not visible against 90% of the textures, black text with no outline is not readable outside of 20 feet, and the green outlines for allies fade into near invisibility against the sky. You can't tell whether or not your flag has been taken unless you look at the stand, king of the flag matches often last 30 seconds because you can't see yellow flag against yellow sand, and abilities like Adaptive Strike have virtually no visible projectile - making it difficult to judge distances. Some of the silhouettes and colors aren't bold enough to determine what you're fighting until they fire at you, players will randomly appear and disappear from the scoreboard and on and on and on.  You don't find any of these things to be a problem?  And, to be clear, I own the game. I play every day and enjoy it. I don't personally find the cost unworthy, but there are many with interest who do. We rarely have more than 8 people playing at a time right now, and the primary server is capped at 12. Playing with the same few people bores even me, and I already love the game -  so I can't imagine it's looking too promising for new players. Maybe if there's a free weekend or something, and people can get some hands on experience, they'll be less hesitant to buy it later - but otherwise, I think a lot of people who would enjoy the game are going to pass on it for no other reason than that."
AirBrawl,3bciz6,ArkEneru,3,Sun Jun 28 04:15:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't feel like any of those are a problem. The knockback and ttk 'issues' aren't that practically nonexistent if you know the maps and aren't just playing a squishy plane the entire time. Sure, you'll still get 1hitkoed a fair amount of the time, but thats honestly not unfun when its clear you've been outplayed (knowing when you've been outplayed in terms of map/class/weapon knowledge just comes with time). Dogfights shouldn't be long and drawn out like something such as War Thunder. In a match between seasoned players, about thirty percent of all engagements will end in a one hit, while the others end up becoming a concise dogfight involving quick plays to determine the outcome. I don't experience issues with visibility, and people who are using the sharpshooter exclusively just haven't discovered that its literally the worst class yet (the exception here is laser guided rockets, they are perhaps one of the most powerful weapons in the game). The population problems are negated by the fact that we have the weekly tournament is consistently populated and the teamspeak has a healthy community."
AirBrawl,3bciz6,ArkEneru,2,Sun Jun 28 04:49:33 2015 UTC,"How do you counter things like Magnetism, Shotgun, Poison Darts, and Swords - and how does their effective use correlate with knowledge or skill? How could something like Soul Trap ever compare to Entangling Roots? Have you ever seen someone wreck shit with Adaptive Strike who wouldn't be doing infinitely better with another weapon?  Is it possible that you're a trouble-making hepcat who is being intentionally contrary to stick it to the man, and convince your love interest that I'm wrong for her because I don't even know why they're called Applejacks if they don't taste like apples?"
AirBrawl,3bciz6,bradsmr,3,Sun Jun 28 05:35:25 2015 UTC,"Magnetism is easy to counter, just get away from any walls, ground, as quickly as possible. Its especially easy in a game like AirBrawl because of the extremely responsive controls.  Shotguns are harder to counter but counter-able none the less. Using 'assassinations' like you said above becomes more important, or alternatively using a longer range weapon like snipe, LGR, or light bringer (VKK, DMR, Adaptive Strike, and Harvester secondarily.) Thirdly, you could utilize the tanky-ness of the viking to brute force your way through the first volley of shotgun rounds and finish the fatbird off before he fires a second. Finally, using the spirit charge to charge backwards is a great counter as well: The witchd/elder is tanky enough and if you pay attention to when the enemy fires you can dodge the second burst.  Poison Darts: The weakness of poison darts is that the projectiles have a slow travel time: if a witch doctor is close enough to take a big whiff of dat ass when he starts firing, then yes his target will be dead. Thats true of a lot of weapons. However, their effective range drops off very quickly due to users having a hard to landing shots. Like before, focus on assassinations, go longer range, or brute force your way through.  Swords suffer from the same problem as Poison Darts, albeit not in a way so pronounced. I personally don't understand whats so OP about them- the do a little damage, do a little stun, and take some time to reach their target. If you're using the mobility of your planes to the highest degree, then you might be able to get away. But if a player is strong enough to hit you with both swords, that player would have been able to kill you with any other weapon. My advice to counter swords is to fly erratically and turn around to face the cyber priest.   How does something like Soul Trap ever compare to entangling roots   Uh, what? These are two completely different weapons. 'How does something like the Ragnarok ever compare to the Net?'  They are both situational weapons, but they are used for completely different situations. The soul catcher can 1 hit on its own, while entangle could not possibly kill enemies without the help of a primary weapon. Soul Catcher also servers as a displacement weapon. If an enemy is about the cap a flag, using soul catcher can put them: severely off course. While entangle can be escaped or budged with mobility weapons or abilities, Soul Catcher is inescapable and disorienting.   wreck shit with Adaptive Strike who wouldn't be doing infinitely better with another weapon?   This sentence confuses me. I can't tell if you think Adaptive Strike is OP or UP. Either way, I found it odd you mentioned many weapons such as  Magnetism, Shotgun, Poison Darts, and Swords, but not really any weapons that are actually very powerful such as Air Cannon."

AirBrawl,3b89ys,SolidRubrical,4,Fri Jun 26 19:43:34 2015 UTC,"Remove knockback from Sniper.  Make Gravity Bomb slow and redirect movement, instead of snapping to center and trapping.  Make EMP much harder to land, and cause jerky movement (like an unresponsive mouse) instead of complete disability.  Boom, done.  Balance in this game is extraordinarily straight forward. The idea is to encourage people to dogfight and take advantage of the ridiculous maneuverability. If people die in one shot from more than half of the weapons, and face an endless stream of abilities that control or impair movement - it rather defeats the point.  Make knockbacks and CCs less drastic, take away full incapacitates, stop the drunken vision impairment, slightly increase TTK across the board, and make grazing the environment more forgiving. You want abilities that damage and counter without completely disabling - right now combat more closely resembles assassination than an actual battle.  You want ability sets that compliment each other without breaking the world. Take Hammers and Frost, for example. It's strong (obviously frost slows way too much), and can wreck shit when used effectively, but it also has an array of counters. Redirect them before the hammer lands with Gravity bomb. Use spirit charge to skip away. Use Toxic Gas. Knock yourself in an unpredictable direction with Barrel or Air Cannon. Use net in an encolsed space. Teleport away with Intervention. Use sunray mines to discourage pursuit. Or, just lose them with a clever manuever. Most primaries should be complimented by certain secondaries, with a special that either compensates for a weakness or magnifies a strength. And, in case it isn't obvious, ease of use should count for a lot - easy to use weapons shouldn't also be the strongest.  Movement, performance and general combat mechanics are already smooth as butter; this should be the easy part."

AirBrawl,3b3yv4,NinjamanAway,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:42:25 2015 UTC,"the game looks very interesting, waiting to see how it develops since anyways I have limited free time and loads of other good games I haven't even installed"
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,MarkMyWords12345,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:22:11 2015 UTC,"Played it on when it was free but i don't have a decent comp, only a laptop atm so i found it difficult to play. I will definitely buy when I get a decent pc though"

AirBrawl,3b3yv4,Entwined_Lotus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:57:57 2015 UTC,Personaly the game right now as it is ( on a lower budget ) isnt worth the 10€ for me but I do love the game and is on my wishlist
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,Relius_,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:23:10 2015 UTC,"I did buy it because I had so much fun on the alpha. But now it seems like I join a game and there's 3 ppl who are waaayyy above my level and maybe one guy who's flying around aimlessly.  Not sure how other games deal with this issue.   Also, I would love some single player non combat games (like shooting at targets or capturing moving flags, or getting threw rings in a certain time)."
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,IxDo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:25:58 2015 UTC,"I want to buy the game, but I've been short on funding for quite a while. I'll buy it eventually."
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,ziztark,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:34:33 2015 UTC,"I really liked the game before it went out on steam, but I feel like it's one of those games that I will spend maybe 50 hours in and then never play again. I will pick it up on a sale if my steam wallet can handle it though :-)"
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,hrjet,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:14:00 2015 UTC,"Well, then it's worth it if you follow the golden rule of 1 dollar = 1 hour. :)"
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,ArkEneru,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:54:59 2015 UTC,"I have the game, and I love it, but i'ma a very distracted gamer, and I can rarely stick to games that dont have a story for longer than an hour or two each week.  As much as i'd love to play it more, it's just not very fun for me to play for more than a couple hours (not that it's a bad game, not at all I love it, but again, distracted gamer).  I just think it's a combination of people that play irregularly, people that are waiting to see if/when it comes out of EA, people that just subscribed for the gifs or because of the /r/all posts, etc..."
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,hrjet,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:20:36 2015 UTC,"I am waiting to buy this game. However, I don't want to buy via Steam (I don't want to install a large platform on my system). I will purchase when either:   A standalone version is available (that doesn't require steam) I build a separate gaming rig, where I don't care about what software I install."
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,ArkEneru,1 point,Fri Jun 26 04:20:52 2015 UTC,Can I ask why you are so against Steam?
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,KonyHawkProSkater,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:12:50 2015 UTC,"Well, I am not against it, but generally avoid large closed-source platforms that get installed on / and need to be installed with sudo. It would be possible to sandbox it in a container or VM, but I don't want to go through it for a game."
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,ArkEneru,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:52:01 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I'm just not as knowledgeable about technology as you are. Could you explain your reason for avoiding Steam in more laymans terms?"
AirBrawl,3b3yv4,dannycalamity,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:56:35 2015 UTC,"Some people don't like closed-source software because the code can't be inspected to make sure it doesn't do anything shady with your computer, like gathering unnecessary private data."

AirBrawl,3b3yv4,MTB666,1 point,Fri Jun 26 08:04:02 2015 UTC,I tried it and just couldn't get the controls down on my laptop while sitting on a couch. Maybe when I get around to setting up my office I'll give it another try.

AirBrawl,3ay5bw,GGDomination,4,Wed Jun 24 16:09:42 2015 UTC,I have no idea how you're this good. I played in the alpha and could barely last a second without clipping my wing on a building. Great job
AirBrawl,3ay5bw,AutomaticNarwhal,8,Wed Jun 24 16:12:05 2015 UTC,I have no idea if I am good or not. I just do my best and try and record some cool stuff I have done and share it with the community.  Edit: I crash just like everyone else. I crash 1/3 of the time for making a mistake that I shouldn't have. Anyone can do what I am doing with practice. Nothing is out of reach of anyone.

AirBrawl,3ay5bw,Fork-H,2,Wed Jun 24 14:59:06 2015 UTC,It kind of looked like a frame drop if the gif loaded up slowly. I was in the same confusing part as the other poster before I realized it.
AirBrawl,3ay5bw,Mattigators,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:17:54 2015 UTC,Huh Weird.
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,SolidRubrical,2,Wed Jun 24 16:20:48 2015 UTC,"I think suggestions two and three are something for much, much later in the game. After all, it's only in it's early stages. For suggestion four, there already is something like that. When you go off the border, it says in red text on your screen return to the battlefield. I support suggestion five and seven, and am neutral for suggestions one and six. How do you suppose levels would be determined?"
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,RimeboundNinja,2,Thu Jun 25 01:08:44 2015 UTC,"I was thinking xp (from kills, captures etc.) based levels where there's a max level and if ranked mode is added, you might need to hit max or a sertan level to play ranked.  I am not sure about how much should be determined by level though, weapons and planes, if customization is added; parts. Should probably not be unlocked by levels, new players have it hard enough already.  I have seen the ""Return to battlefield"" indicator, but it seems like it doesn't work all the time for me, if I go to the side or straight up, it doesn't always show up. That is probably a bug that can be fixed instead of making something all new though."
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,RimeboundNinja,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:45:51 2015 UTC,"Experience could be sabotaged with multiboxing, and I've always seen the Return to Battlefield indicator; you might want to put up a bug report."
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,RimeboundNinja,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:04:45 2015 UTC,"I hadn't heard of multiboxing for xp before, and I think it would be even harder in this game unless you have a script that does everything you need.  I will go in game now and check out when exactly I don't get the indicator and if it still doesn't show up all the time. I will put one up. :)"
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,natneo81,1 point,Thu Jun 25 17:28:06 2015 UTC,"Well, if you had two other planes on opposite teams, it wouldn't be that hard to farm them for experience."
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,SirMStachio,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:51:12 2015 UTC,Seems the indicator works fine now. Might have been something wrong yesterday or I was too tired to see it. :P
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,-bask,2,Thu Jun 25 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"Customizable planes would be awesome, something like in luftrausers maybe"
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,Wilnyl,2,Thu Jun 25 02:16:07 2015 UTC,There are indicators for the map size thingy
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,-bask,0,Thu Jun 25 05:09:22 2015 UTC,"It's a shame to make my first post so negative, but:  These are the sort of features that would, if added to the game, make me hesitant to continue playing.  No levels. No customization. No stats. No ranked modes.  This is a match based dogfighter. You open the game, jump in a server, and have fun.  When the gameplay stops being a strong enough reason to continue, you stop playing.  If the game becomes popular enough for tournaments and competitions, there are a lot of external services to help organize them - it doesn't need to be a feature."
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,ziztark,7,Thu Jun 25 02:28:42 2015 UTC,"Sorry then dude, stats and levels are definitely coming. It's easy to add features that adds a lot for some and doesn't remove much for others."
AirBrawl,3ayt5a,-bask,-2,Thu Jun 25 09:04:57 2015 UTC,"Levels don't matter all that much (aside from the fact that they separate players by experience and stagnate skill), but are we talking public or private stats? Public stats might get some people playing the game, but it'll also turn the community into a cancerous shithole faster than you can blink.  People start playing to improve their numbers instead of to have fun or win, and then harass everyone in a 3 mile radius when they lose - just look at any of the MOBA communities for proof. Even if you don't care about them, knowing they exist still itches somewhere in the back of your mind; you can never just relax and play like we did in the days of yore.  Feels awful, man."

AirBrawl,3an4ug,TazerLad,3,Sun Jun 21 21:21:56 2015 UTC,"First of, the resolution/quality of the video is not good. Even at (supposedly) 1080, reading the text in the tooltips is near impossible. Furthermore, it's quite choppy. At moments where you're doing a semi-fast maneuver I can see the background jump.  As for the vid's content, you showed some understanding of the game(something other reviewers, etc. (maybe purposefully) didn't) and made decent observations about the game, admitting that you don't have the experience (yet) to give a good full review.(which is a phase all players go through)  One main thing I did not like was you trying to put a price tag on a game that is still in development and not being acquainted with the full gameplay."
AirBrawl,3an4ug,intoxbodmansvs,1 point,Sun Jun 21 23:27:29 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your feedback. I didn't realize the quality was that bad. I recorded in window mode so I guess I just assumed that would take care of quality issues I sometimes have when I record full screen. Clearly I need to do some quality control in the future.   As for the price tag on the game. The only reason why I did that was because based on the store page they said the core gameplay was there and they were just adding stuff on like planes and game modes. I was just saying that at it's current build, I didn't think it is worth $10.00. By the time is game is finished, and more stuff added in, it could very well be worth the final price point. I just think sometimes people will be upset to pay a high price for an incomplete game. All I think is that if they intend on doing incremented price points, they should have started a little lower. Does that make sense?"
AirBrawl,3an4ug,intoxbodmansvs,3,Sun Jun 21 23:49:18 2015 UTC,"I personally think this game is well worth the 10$(or EU for that matter) that I spent on it.  The controls are very good, I never had anything as responsive. Just flying through the structures itself can be very entertaining(for me, at least). Then there's getting to know all the different builds, how you can use them most effectively and in special cases like the Air Cannon, Barrels, etc. learn how to use your surroundings to your advantage or as a weapon.  Lastly, is the community(which is still very small). Wilnyl(the dev) is very active here and comes here quite often to show his latest work or to gather feedback"
AirBrawl,3an4ug,Mostfunguy,-1,Mon Jun 22 00:00:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I acknowledge your opinion. It is a valid one.   Just in my opinion, I wasn't having as much fun with the game as I thought I was going to. And yes the controls are very good and easy to use. That being said, I would expect a game that is on early access would have it's core controls down, especially when that is toted in the trailer for the game.   And while the community is a nice, I don't see that as a justification for the price. Just my opinion.   I guess it just comes down to subjectivity. Some people will see Halo 5 as not worth the price point. I just see it as more of an 8 or 9 dollar game rather than 10 at this point, if you assume the end price point is going to be between 15-20 dollars."
AirBrawl,3an4ug,Mostfunguy,2,Mon Jun 22 00:10:50 2015 UTC,You need it to be 60FPS. There's more choppiness here than in a Jacky Chan movie

AirBrawl,3an4ug,ArkEneru,2,Mon Jun 22 18:49:22 2015 UTC,"Some of your framerate issues are probably due to Park  The map is old and badly optimised, a lot of people can't run it properly, even on great computers"
AirBrawl,3an4ug,ArkEneru,2,Mon Jun 22 10:21:43 2015 UTC,I honestly can't believe you said that AirBrawl wasn't worth 10 dollars. I've played almost 50 hours so far and I envision much more in the future. I literally cringed when I heard you say that.
AirBrawl,3an4ug,ArkEneru,0,Mon Jun 22 18:25:39 2015 UTC,If you look at the above conversation with /u/intoxbodmansvs I think you will see my logic. I don't expect you to agree with it but I think it basically comes down to subjectivity.
AirBrawl,3an4ug,Its-M4RC05,0,Mon Jun 22 18:36:38 2015 UTC,"Well I'm sorry but I don't see your logic, I think its in fact ridiculous.   In general, the kind of content/price relationships people have come to expect these days are insane"
AirBrawl,3an4ug,Its-M4RC05,-4,Mon Jun 22 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"You think it is ridiculous that I feel at most a dollar or two should be knocked off the sticker price of the current build? I was trying to make a commentary on how everything these days I feel is rounded to ''ideal"" numbers. If it isn't a $5 dollar game, then they list it as $10. Not a $10 dollar game? Bump it up to $15 or twenty. An example of a game that I think is doing it right is Besiege. It is also in Early access and is current $7 with the plan to up the price as stuff is added on. There are also plenty of complete games out on Steam right now that are the same price as Air Brawl and offer much more content than this game's current build does."
AirBrawl,3an4ug,TealComet,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:38:37 2015 UTC,"Besiege is amazingly low priced for its content and should not be used as an example. I feel like both Besiege in its current state could be worth 15-20 dollars and AirBrawl is worth a solid 15.  On top of that, not all games are priced based on their content. Replayability is a major factor in determining a game's price. If a game is simple but replayable for many hours I'd say its worth way more than a complicated game that lasts for a few hours and you only ever play once.   There are also plenty of complete games out on Steam right now that are the same price as Air Brawl and offer much more content than this game's current build does.   And if I only play them for 10 hours tops they aren't worth as much. Content isn't everything.  Finally, if you had followed this community for the weeks up until release (and even weeks afterward) it would be evident that Wilnyl works at an extremely fast pace. For the 5 months that Besiege has been on Steam, there have been some new stages and a few new blocks. However, over the past 2 months of AirBrawl's development there have been quite a few new weapons, maps, gamemodes, and other content added to the game. Even if the amount of content is shaky (which its really not the case) the frequent additions show that much more is to come very soon."
AirBrawl,3aiz6t,sharktopuskracken,11,Sat Jun 20 17:29:51 2015 UTC,It would be better to do a poll by which weapons are overpowered and which are underpowered. A plane has 9 different combinations of weapons.

AirBrawl,3aiz6t,origamania,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"well if you're just hitting people with the anchor and running away you're doing it wrong   it does 40 damage. thats a considerable amount. a single uncharged hammer and an anchor will kill a snipers and cyber priest, for comparison.

Time and time again I see people post videos on youtube about Air Brawl, they don't know how to play because they skipped the tutorial thinking they don't need it or are too good for it. (and some of them proceed to rant on the game because they suck)  Do you think it's funny watching people have a revelation about finding the friggin boost button?"
AirBrawl,3aevg0,intoxbodmansvs,4,Sat Jun 20 08:02:34 2015 UTC,"Some people prefer figuring it out themselves blind first before really learning it in the tutorial. /u/SanseeZilla seems to be one of them. You can definitely hear how much he enjoys it and in the end he recommends it.  Videos like this also show the perspective of a new player, which can be pretty important for development. Of course the complexity of the game should not suffer, but making it easier for beginners might be a good idea in the future, for example by adding a ""This is the first time you opened the game. Do you want to play the Tutorial?"" screen, or adding quick tips at the bottom of the spawn menu.   Of course people that rant about the game because they don't understand it are just idiots."
AirBrawl,3aevg0,Calamity701,2,Sat Jun 20 13:03:06 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure the game throws you straight into the tutorial the first time you load it up

The tutorial admittedly could be better, but that's no excuse to ignore it entirely  I really think Wil should make the tutorial unskippable"

AirBrawl,3a66wt,Its-M4RC05,5,Wed Jun 17 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah. A timer might be a good idea for a server option. But I don't know about them being mandatory, the matches are fine lengths as they are."
AirBrawl,3a66wt,ArkEneru,2,Wed Jun 17 17:39:29 2015 UTC,"I think most of the reason you see drawn out games is because the game is newer and smaller still. There's usually only a couple servers active at a time from what I can tell, so ocassionally if you get into a smaller game, yeah, it drags out because there's 2 people in a TDM game.  I think it'll resolve itself as the game gains popularity. Spread the word! Buy the 4 pack and give some away."

AirBrawl,3a4nvx,Valkorian,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:58:21 2015 UTC,And I actually dislike this feature because it doesn't support windowed fullscreen.
AirBrawl,3a4nvx,TheChrono,2,Wed Jun 17 14:59:44 2015 UTC,"I assume you're talking about borderless windowed? You can do that with the use of launch flags. Go into properties> Set launch options> type in ""-popupwindow"" and then set airbrawl to launch in windowed on the options splash menu.  And then you can alt tab to your hearts delight without it minimizing. Although if your mouse is locked (while flying) and you open the steam overlay, it will derp out. But toggling the overlay fixes that."

AirBrawl,3a59ii,Cowgus,0,Wed Jun 17 11:50:31 2015 UTC,"In regards to the swivel, I would argue that without it, it may get disorientating. The swivel shows the transition, meaning, you don't accidentally press it, get confused and crash."
AirBrawl,3a59ii,Cowgus,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:51:57 2015 UTC,"I'd vote to at least have the option to turn it on/off if it isn't too hard to code. I've played a ton of flight sims and I would say that there's a case for keeping the swivel camera movement and a case for getting rid of it.  Competitively, I would also rather the instant camera for quick checks.  That said, if it's specifically being balanced around, leave it as is."

AirBrawl,3a1q32,Yosepi,7,Tue Jun 16 17:51:43 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input! Yeah that is probably a good idea.
AirBrawl,3a1q32,TheChrono,2,Tue Jun 16 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Something that Heroes of Newerth did that I loved was explaining why they added or made a change. It really helps us understand what was going on and connects us to the dev process.  With that said, this is an amazing way to display the patch notes. It's easily accessible and well formatted. If I were to stop playing I'd probably still read the patch notes if they looked this good and didn't redirect me to a whole new page. Then I'd probably come back for new patches."

AirBrawl,3a1q32,crilen,4,Tue Jun 16 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"This is good  Sniper is still the most accessible class in my opinion, so new players can get into the game quickly. A long-range weapon, a semi-auto and auto mid-range weapon, the tether teaches you to fly well, and the grav bomb is a special that's quite easy to understand and can be used short-range  But, now there aren't 8 snipers flying around a server making the game less fun  Of course, sniper can still be used (very effectively) in high level play, but these nerfs will hopefully encourage people to vary their loadouts more"
AirBrawl,3a1q32,intoxbodmansvs,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:08:50 2015 UTC,The grav bomb is nearly useless now is what I'm saying. The rest I was ok with.  With enough speed they fly right through the grav bomb.

I played AirBrawl a while ago, maybe a month but it seemed fun despite a weird control scheme I couldn't get used to.  It was on my shitty work computer so I apologize if things have changed, if it was my inability to really play the game or me just not getting how it's supposed to be played.  It just seems to me that when a new ship or a new weapon gets made and shown off it looks like it's a powerful, insta kill game breaking weapon.  It's difficult enough to just maneuver through the tight spaces on the map, and it seems like every gif on here of a new weapon I see is designed to take someone out instantly no matter the situation, either by slamming them into the nearest wall without mercy, blowing them up in the sky with 100% accuracy, or make it nearly impossible to fly.  If that's supposed to be how the game is played then ignore what I'm saying, maybe I'm just too used to games like Warthunder or I just sucked at this game.  What kind of balance system is in place where you can take damage without instantly dying or practically being forced into the nearest wall?"

AirBrawl,3a00qt,iTarget,2,Tue Jun 16 04:02:47 2015 UTC,"A lot of things. Most importantly, homing and turret have been removed and replaced with more interesting weapons: and electric tether and wire guided missiles. Each plane has new weapons, (those might be better left unspoiled) and there is a new plane: the elder, a tree-themed plane. There are multiple new gamemodes including free for all and flagmaster.   Some advice: the public multiplayer isn't extremely active, although it is usually possible to find a match. I'd still recommend this game, however, because the weekly casual tournament is exciting and MLAB has a lot of potential."

AirBrawl,39wcb7,Wilnyl,6,Mon Jun 15 09:37:48 2015 UTC,"One day I'm gonna wake up to:  ""Flying"" ability removed from Sniper"
AirBrawl,39wcb7,lemonhead7t7,4,Mon Jun 15 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"I feel like a lot of the secondary weapons could have longer cooldowns, honestly. Nothing crazy, just a couple extra seconds tacked on. As much as I love spamming air cannon with Fat Bird or Swords with the Priest, I think it should reward actually aiming right the first time more, as it is now, if you miss you can just spam it some more.  On a non-balancing note: It would be great if the Flagmaster gametypes required more points to win. Double it. 120 for FFA, 240 or whatever for Team. 300 maybe. Especially in FFA, the 60 seconds goes by super fast, but I love the gametype.  Also, I know I'm not alone here, but when I first started, I spent about an hour thinking the green box meant 'enemy', like you're trying to lock on to it. It doesn't need to change, but maybe mention it in the little tutorial you do in the beginning.  Maybe something about the gametypes in the tutorial too, I've run into a couple different people who never voted for Flagmaster because they simply had no idea what it was."
AirBrawl,39wcb7,Virunus,2,Mon Jun 15 19:24:25 2015 UTC,"also, a win-limit of 5 at CTF. 3 is over in a heartbeat"

AirBrawl,39pwk1,Mister_Meh,3,Sat Jun 13 17:12:53 2015 UTC,"Its so fun playing in first person, and I can easily maneuver around buildings , but my FOV is too low to be able to easily match other people flying"
AirBrawl,39pwk1,sharktopuskracken,3,Sat Jun 13 18:01:42 2015 UTC,"If you look closely, the fov doesn't change between first and third person, however you do have stuff blocking your screen which is a disadvantage (but is kinda the point of first person)"
AirBrawl,39pwk1,Thegamingrobin,2,Sun Jun 14 13:50:43 2015 UTC,"ya thats what I mean, its harder to know where the other planes are if  I cant see as much as them. I guess its just a good challenge once you get good at normal view :)"
AirBrawl,39pwk1,sharktopuskracken,5,Sun Jun 14 14:41:42 2015 UTC,Flying from Ark in first person is absolutely terrifying. Especially when you can see the hammer come down on you in the corners of the screen...
AirBrawl,39pwk1,Nesfero,2,Sat Jun 13 22:37:04 2015 UTC,That is absolutely the most pants-shittingest thing in this game.

AirBrawl,39rhle,SirMStachio,6,Sun Jun 14 01:15:54 2015 UTC,"Sharpshooter  definitely needs balancing. However, I would argue against a class limit as it is always annoying in multiplayer games when you can't play as what you want."
AirBrawl,39rhle,Cowgus,2,Sun Jun 14 14:22:54 2015 UTC,"Snipes I can usually deal with... but the G-bombs... the god damn G-BOMBS  Aim in general direction of enemy. If bomb attaches to surface, enemy is kill. If bomb is in mid air, proceed to snipe enemy.   On topic: I can see your point, but limiting the already relatively small amount of choice could turn out bad. But I'm no expert, and only got the game for a week"
AirBrawl,39rhle,intoxbodmansvs,4,Sun Jun 14 01:46:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah the damn gribs definitely need a nerf. They're rather inescapable, almost always result in a 1-hit kill, and require little skill."
AirBrawl,39rhle,ArkEneru,3,Sun Jun 14 02:09:53 2015 UTC,I don't know about a class limit: I think that balancing out each class so each is played more or less the same amount is a better idea.
AirBrawl,39rhle,ArkEneru,1 point,Sun Jun 14 02:11:47 2015 UTC,"Comp might need a class limit.  If the game is balanced, pubs shouldn't need a class limit."

AirBrawl,39n8e4,Cowgus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:17:23 2015 UTC,Try plugging that in and playing with mouse and keyboard. Also try playing around with the key bindings in the input tab on the launcher menu.
AirBrawl,39n8e4,Cowgus,1 point,Fri Jun 12 23:29:29 2015 UTC,"Please also check that all your mouse drivers are up to date, just in case."

AirBrawl,39lts2,Highsight,6,Fri Jun 12 17:13:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Wilnyl really needs to add the 'green means friend' indicator in he tutorial."
AirBrawl,39lts2,ArkEneru,3,Fri Jun 12 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"people seem to have issues figure out what [Alt Fire] means also. All the ""reviews"" I've seen just jump in and play, instead of reading the descriptions of the weapons. [Alt fire] is only mentioned once in the tutorial, and you aren't really asked to try it out, so most people seem to not remember it when they have a weapon that can use it."
AirBrawl,39lts2,albinobluesheep,4,Fri Jun 12 21:02:03 2015 UTC,"That'd be a start, but I'd love to see an entire overhaul of team indication personally.  It needs to be something that can be seen from a distance, so you can know at a glance who is an enemy and who is a friend.  One suggestion my chat recommended that I really liked was a Skyrim style compass that showed your allies on it, but not the enemies.  (Though a spotting system would be nice and plane team paint...)"
AirBrawl,39lts2,ArkEneru,2,Fri Jun 12 17:42:56 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I kinda like the harder core player detection we have right now. I think the supposed 'distance visibility problem' isn't really a problem: the lack of obvious targets from across the maps makes 'across the map' shots even more skillful."
AirBrawl,39lts2,MrNecktie,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:43:11 2015 UTC,"It's all personal preference really, but that's what server settings are for after all.  For less hardcore players, there could be server settings to turn off things like compasses and easier detection.  This way people can decide their favorite playstyle.  It would help alot with new players as well."
AirBrawl,39lts2,ArkEneru,3,Fri Jun 12 19:09:11 2015 UTC,"Hey Highsight! Great playing with you -- I remember these matches! Shotgun definitely could use a nerf, but it's really ineffective at range -- snipe (and the sniper class) needs it too. The physics in general is a double-edged sword, with the ability to throw or be thrown into geometry at random. I'm finding sticky/flak to be just as viable as shotgun/flak in a lot of situations.  I totally agree with your final points about audience. It definitely takes a huge influx of people and I feel kinda bad winning like I did/am. I'm actually really new to the game, having only bought it when it came into early access. A lot of people I've played with over the last week have shown marked improvement even since these matches. I think a lot of it has to do with previous experience -- I've got hundreds of hours into the Descent franchise and several other arcadey flight combat sims that could be seen as similar to this one.  Awesome video -- first time I've been on YouTube for anything game related!"
AirBrawl,39lts2,MrNecktie,2,Fri Jun 12 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"NECKTIE!!! Hahaha, those matches were a blast. (despite my monster internal rage) =p I did some private matches after the fact with some of my viewers, and we all started getting good quickly, which is a great sign for the game!   I'd say, balancing issues aside, this game has a bright future, so long as it gets the audience it deserves. As an old school Decent player myself, this game is my jam, and I hope I can bring more players into it!"
AirBrawl,39mzyh,ArkEneru,2,Fri Jun 12 22:07:45 2015 UTC,Is there a category for bitch'n laps through the sand underground? I can almost get through the fan things every time now.

AirBrawl,39lo63,Cowgus,3,Fri Jun 12 20:42:06 2015 UTC,"It's similar to Counterstrike, you need to HEAR where planes are near by."
AirBrawl,39lo63,crilen,6,Fri Jun 12 20:34:51 2015 UTC,"I have to say, the positional audio in the game is pretty good. I can hear what plane is closing in on me and the direction it's coming from"
AirBrawl,39lo63,intoxbodmansvs,2,Fri Jun 12 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"I mean yeah; Music is a GREAT if not necessary addition to a game. But with Air Brawl, as crilen said, it's best to have full listening capability to hear incoming planes :) But yes; Music would be nice to fill the void between gunshots :D"
AirBrawl,39lo63,Mister_Meh,2,Sat Jun 13 00:40:11 2015 UTC,A script could detect planes getting closer and lower music volume based on that. That would be cooolool

They join the game, have no idea how to play or fly, and get destroyed because they don't know simple controls, such as hitting ""v"" to look behind you.       How about this? If they skip the tutorial and go online, show a splash screen of sorts detailing how to control your plane, showing all of the keys you need to play.       That way when people jump online they can at least (maybe) read how to play the game, instead of struggling."

AirBrawl,399ho1,Mister_Meh,16,Thu Jun 11 05:28:19 2015 UTC,"Hey, I played with /u/sarcasticpineapple a bunch today too. Wonder if it's the same guys as the reddit user. Seems likely, given the name. Is your IGN ""Jimmy"", perchance? I may have been being shot by you.  In general, all the players I've run into so far have been really good about everything. The game maintains a very light, but competitive spirit. You want to win, but if you lose ... you'll just win the next one! There's definitely something to be said about not having any long-term score memory."
AirBrawl,399ho1,notyetawizard,6,Wed Jun 10 08:33:44 2015 UTC,My IGN happens to be 'Jimmy' and I remember you notyetwizard from our games as well!
AirBrawl,399ho1,LaizureBoy,3,Wed Jun 10 14:08:53 2015 UTC,Haha i played with you as well! My username is the same.        I also played with pineapple! Cool guy!
AirBrawl,399ho1,Nj0y_GoDZz,2,Wed Jun 10 15:04:01 2015 UTC,Are you sure your IGN is 'Jimmy'? Because mine is 'Jimmy' as well?
AirBrawl,399ho1,intoxbodmansvs,3,Wed Jun 10 16:45:14 2015 UTC,I demand a Jimmy vs Jimmy
AirBrawl,399ho1,notyetawizard,1 point,Wed Jun 10 20:22:53 2015 UTC,I don't think IGNs need to be unique. You just pick one.
AirBrawl,399ho1,MrNecktie,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:44:32 2015 UTC,haha it is though lol i thunk you can have whatever one u want i guess...
AirBrawl,399ho1,SarcasticPineapple,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:51:42 2015 UTC,I remember you from last night! Cool stuff man -- glad to hear you're enjoying it.

AirBrawl,399ho1,notyetawizard,3,Wed Jun 10 16:26:44 2015 UTC,I was playing with you the other day!

AirBrawl,399ho1,Mister_Meh,3,Wed Jun 10 13:38:42 2015 UTC,That's pretty cool!
AirBrawl,399ho1,SarcasticPineapple,4,Wed Jun 10 13:45:49 2015 UTC,"I find in many of my matches, I play with /u/sarcasticpineapple. great guy, even though he likes to shoot me down many times. (many = way too many) Great guy, Great game, Great community. Keep it up guys :D cheers!"
AirBrawl,399ho1,Mister_Meh,2,Wed Jun 10 22:43:23 2015 UTC,Hey thanks! And you'll get me back soon if you havent already

AirBrawl,399ho1,Mister_Meh,2,Thu Jun 11 05:29:16 2015 UTC,"Im really not that great haha, if you see necktie in a match ask him for some tips cause he's awesome. If you want my advice start a private match and explore the underground part of sand because if you can manage to not crash in there, you'll do fine everywhere else :)"
AirBrawl,399ho1,SarcasticPineapple,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:21:53 2015 UTC,"hahaha :D I've always wanted to do private matches, and i have loved to explore sand :D But my only beef with Air Brawl at the moment is the inability to do offline practice...i mean...there's the tutorial, but it's not the same as bots, and ""offline mode"" doesn't work, and haha yeah......i just REALLY want some sort of offline bots practice mode :D"
AirBrawl,399ho1,Mister_Meh,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:07:29 2015 UTC,"Start a server and password protect it, bots auto fly around and dont shoot at you"
AirBrawl,399ho1,SarcasticPineapple,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:08:23 2015 UTC,"no, what i mean is just flying around offline. What i mean by offline is actually 100% disconnected from the network. I've tried starting a server, and even doing offline mode, but it doesn't work. :|"
AirBrawl,399ho1,Mister_Meh,2,Fri Jun 12 05:21:11 2015 UTC,Well if you see me online add me on steam and I'll start a server for us to practice then. That sound good? :)
AirBrawl,39e598,notyetawizard,2,Thu Jun 11 03:28:20 2015 UTC,"Good idea, but CTF is at a disadvantage because there is only one CTF, while deathmatch and flagmaster have team and solo modes"
AirBrawl,39e598,Yosepi,1 point,Thu Jun 11 13:10:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I thought of that, but voting for CTF is still a vote for a team game, and that should count for something even if everyone else votes deathmatch."
AirBrawl,39e598,intoxbodmansvs,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:53:10 2015 UTC,"obstacle course, I'd love it.  Like the tunnels that run all the way around in Sand, but better"
AirBrawl,39axdc,blindedeyes,9,Wed Jun 10 14:47:54 2015 UTC,Also the messages disappear too quickly and theres no way to check the history.
AirBrawl,39axdc,Najda,2,Wed Jun 10 15:48:54 2015 UTC,This also. ^
AirBrawl,39axdc,Wilnyl,7,Wed Jun 10 16:01:36 2015 UTC,Adding this to the fix list
AirBrawl,39axdc,Wilnyl,3,Wed Jun 10 17:08:11 2015 UTC,"May I also add, a slider to set the size of chat? If at all possible.   Why? This will allow the chat to be set to the user's preference, meaning someone on a large screen can sizeup, someone on low screen can size down, people who dont want to see it can shrink it to nothing. Just some ideas :D  Far from core mechanics, just slight polish."
AirBrawl,39axdc,Hotwir3,3,Wed Jun 10 17:13:27 2015 UTC,Thats actually a great idea as well. Thank you
AirBrawl,39axdc,SirMStachio,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:18:02 2015 UTC,A suggestion I have is when it's team mode that the menu highlight colors on the death screen are the color of the team you're on. I believe the menu highlights are always red and this has confused me once when I was on blue.
AirBrawl,39axdc,crilen,3,Thu Jun 11 15:34:57 2015 UTC,Your name fits this perfectly.
AirBrawl,39axdc,Mister_Meh,3,Wed Jun 10 14:51:37 2015 UTC,My name fits lots of things perfectly. xD
AirBrawl,396ylq,fizzypickles,37,Tue Jun 9 18:25:31 2015 UTC,Just standing outside of someone's house watching them play Air Brawl.
AirBrawl,396ylq,SirMStachio,11,Tue Jun 9 19:36:21 2015 UTC,Why do that when you can just envy a streamer in the comfort of your own home?

AirBrawl,396ylq,Zobtzler,22,Tue Jun 9 23:06:13 2015 UTC,This guy is awesome! He didn't gift it but I just sent my stuff. He would forever go down in history as a Air Brawl Hero!  EDIT : FORK DELIVERED! He is the Air Brawl Junior of the year!
AirBrawl,396ylq,Fork-H,6,Tue Jun 9 23:31:38 2015 UTC,Do you have now the game?

AirBrawl,396ylq,iwouldliketoreply,6,Wed Jun 10 03:21:02 2015 UTC,Or draw shitty trading cards on MS Paint and become the official artist!
AirBrawl,396ylq,iwouldliketoreply,5,Tue Jun 9 19:11:17 2015 UTC,Ya but I only get like $3.50
AirBrawl,396ylq,crschwall,4,Tue Jun 9 20:04:30 2015 UTC,Beat up more.  Homeless guys are like Lay's - you can't have just one.
AirBrawl,396ylq,yokcos700,2,Tue Jun 9 23:28:20 2015 UTC,Or collect pop-cans. Cut someone's lawn. Pick up someones groceries. There's lots you can do for $10.
AirBrawl,398c8o,SirMStachio,7,Wed Jun 10 00:01:06 2015 UTC,"OK, as someone who truly loves the air cannon, I'm going to have to disagree with this. It's already the most versatile secondary in the entire game. It can be used offensively or defensively in a number of different ways, as both a weapon and a mobility tool. Hell, the mobility aspect already makes it a partial counter to immobilizing secondaries such as entangle, frost missile, and gravity bomb (sorta). It doesn't need to be a near-complete counter to one of the witch doctor's best tricks."
AirBrawl,398c8o,Papyrifer,3,Wed Jun 10 13:30:16 2015 UTC,Thanks for the input. I never really used the Air Cannon that much so its nice to hear an opinion from someone who understands its qualities. The only reason why I suggested this was because it just felt weird to be able to push air and not gas.
AirBrawl,398c8o,Cowgus,2,Wed Jun 10 14:29:35 2015 UTC,"True, could make for some interesting moments with a witch doctor blocking a point or tunnel but being countered by the air cannon of a fatbird. Although, for balancing sake, it should have some kind of negative."
AirBrawl,398c8o,Cowgus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:35:11 2015 UTC,Yeah there should defiantly be some de-buffs if the Air Cannon could do this. Mostly because people would just spam it all the time. Maybe a longer delay for each shot and half the range?
AirBrawl,398c8o,Cowgus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:38:28 2015 UTC,"Or maybe cause the smoke to increase in concentration when hit, so if you are in a tunnel, you might still be hit with a lot of damage as you haven't cleared it into open air. This way, it could focus on teamwork as although, it would still be enough to kill you, a healing cyber priest could make it through, or any plans with more health really."
AirBrawl,398c8o,Cowgus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:44:29 2015 UTC,"I like this idea, pushed to the side but more deadly. There should probably still be some sorta de-buff to the Air Cannon though."
AirBrawl,398c8o,Cowgus,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:52:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, maybe it could have a longer cool down. But that would limit the cool manuvers you can do in other situations."
AirBrawl,398c8o,Mister_Meh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:59:18 2015 UTC,Yeah :( sometimes things have to be sacrificed for the good of others.
AirBrawl,398c8o,Far_and_Clear,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:02:22 2015 UTC,"Perhaps instead of that, it should just have much larger knock back for the person firing it. That way, you might lose the witch doctor you are chasing and cool manuvers would still be frequent."
AirBrawl,398c8o,Far_and_Clear,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:06:08 2015 UTC,Yeah I could see that but the pull mechanic shouldn't have the same effect because sped and all...
AirBrawl,398c8o,crilen,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:12:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if pulling it should stay relatively equal to what it is now."
AirBrawl,398c8o,crilen,2,Wed Jun 10 01:17:13 2015 UTC,I think the push range for other planes should be halved that way people don't push players from a bajilion miles away into a wall. You have to be like UP CLOSE to push them. It would break some of the spiral battles that happen where people just spiral around to fight each other.  It would add some strategy to how you use it.
AirBrawl,397zgg,zorberema_,7,Tue Jun 9 22:27:53 2015 UTC,Glorious! Inspiration for my next unrivalled work! Bravo old chap!

AirBrawl,399dp9,Emorigg,2,Wed Jun 10 05:02:42 2015 UTC,I'd also say to post when you stream or we could have a main stream thread everyone lists stream times and such here.
AirBrawl,399dp9,blindedeyes,1 point,Wed Jun 10 19:47:28 2015 UTC,"Yea, I was going to try to set up a schedule but I don't want to commit to anything as of now. That's why I made a Twitter account so I could tweet before every broadcast and then if I get a schedule I could post it there. I just don't want to fill the sub with streaming posts so a main thread would be a great idea :b"
AirBrawl,396zpu,Mister_Meh,3,Tue Jun 9 18:32:48 2015 UTC,That's my only move. Get chased. Try to fly erratically. Get killed anyways. Spam the rest of my ammunition while going down.

AirBrawl,397znz,Obamanomicon_,1 point,Wed Jun 10 21:49:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know what that means, but with my limited Google searching just know I'm guessing it's a joystick? I'm not sure if it's working but it does have keybinds in the game for joysticks. Hope this helps!"

I bought one for MS Flight Sim/DCS/Elite: Dangerous, and want to use it on Air Brawl. If the throttle was an axis, and not a button, then it would work.

AirBrawl,391fjm,familyknewmyusername,20,Mon Jun 8 17:25:29 2015 UTC,Because by writing the review in the first place he's exacerbating the issue he's writing about.
AirBrawl,391fjm,amalgam_reynolds,8,Mon Jun 8 20:32:36 2015 UTC,"His motivation is not to get people playing, it's to give an honest review. You've not given a reason for him to not give a negative review."
AirBrawl,391fjm,faore,2,Tue Jun 9 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"It's an honest review, and I have no problem with honesty, I just question the logic of, ""I like it, I want to play it with more people. But first let me click a button the will manipulate more people to not play it.""  I have zero issue with the text of the review or the opinion, just the thumb down. Unless he actually didn't like it."
AirBrawl,391fjm,askeeve,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:47:31 2015 UTC,"If that's his opinion, and you're OK with that, then it's OK to put it in a review. Do you review things only to sell the product or decrease it's sales?"
AirBrawl,391fjm,faore,1 point,Wed Jun 10 00:57:16 2015 UTC,He can do anything he likes. I'm just saying he's perpetuating the only gripe he sees with the product (in the review at least). Again he can do whatever he wants. I'm just saying it doesn't make a lot of sense.
AirBrawl,391fjm,askeeve,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:03:25 2015 UTC,"Sure it makes sense. He's not going to play it any more, any he's recommending to others that they don't buy it because he didn't enjoy it. No part of this doesn't make perfect sense."
AirBrawl,391fjm,faore,-8,Wed Jun 10 01:23:25 2015 UTC,"because a review should be of the quality of a game. its a brand new game, for god sake"
AirBrawl,391fjm,familyknewmyusername,55,Mon Jun 8 17:34:04 2015 UTC,Yes but the popularity of a game where multiplayer is the main focus is directly affected by the number of people playing
AirBrawl,391fjm,Yosepi,22,Mon Jun 8 18:26:39 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you that it makes sense for him to say that  But at the same time, if he likes the game how is he expecting it to get more players if he says it's not worth picking up until it gets more players?"
AirBrawl,391fjm,yangxiaodong,2,Mon Jun 8 18:33:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, i love insurgency, but even that game is pushing me with how few players actually play it."
AirBrawl,391fjm,familyknewmyusername,-17,Mon Jun 8 22:11:41 2015 UTC,my point isnt that he pointed out that there arent that many players yet but that he leveraged that criticism against the quality of the game itself by giving it a negative review
AirBrawl,391fjm,Jester278,19,Mon Jun 8 19:09:15 2015 UTC,"He wasn't saying the game was bad, he was not recommending it. Of he thinks that people will have a negative experience, why should he recommend it?"
AirBrawl,391fjm,familyknewmyusername,4,Mon Jun 8 19:11:21 2015 UTC,"If he likes the game he should recommend it so that more people will buy it, he should still point out that the game has few players though.  edit: I should say that I feel this only applies to new games, if a game has been out for a long time and no one is playing it then I wouldn't recommend it."
AirBrawl,391fjm,Hawkfiend,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:17:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree, but the grey area arises when he didn't like it due to the lack of players, which seems to be the case. Either way, he could have spared a few more words and better explained the good points of the game."
AirBrawl,391fjm,th1341,0,Mon Jun 8 19:22:24 2015 UTC,leveraged that criticism against the quality of the game itself   nope. He simply didn't recommend it. He said the quality was good.
AirBrawl,391fjm,Hawkfiend,-3,Tue Jun 9 03:46:21 2015 UTC,"That's not true, although he SAID the quality was good his review registers as a negative review against the entire game, against the overall score, the score that helps people decide whether to get the game or not. How is it some of you guys aren't getting the basic logic behind this? This is an early access game that just started getting a user base. It's not out yet, it's in alpha, the entire point of charging money for it now is to help it grow into a full release. There are bugs and quirks and few players and that is to be expected, but somehow you think it's completely valid for one of these testers to give this budding indie game that has had very little attention and very little chance to grow a negative rating, impacting the rating of the game on steam, because there aren't that many people that play it yet. How the hell is that in any way valid? That's so illogical that I can't believe I'm having to explain it."
AirBrawl,391fjm,90ne1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:35:01 2015 UTC,"Basically what you are saying is you should review a game based on what it will be like in the future?  So if EA released a game with a bunch if bugs at launch, you should leave 5/5 stars because you know that EA with patch it soon?   I agree, he could have also said some good parts about the game. But I completely agree with the rating he gave. You can't play a multiplayer game if no one plays it.  I get the feeling that you really support the developer because he is a fellow redditer and if it was some other early access game you wouldn't really care.  My point is: You should review a game in its current state. And if it gets better, you go back and give it a better review."
AirBrawl,391fjm,yangxiaodong,1 point,Tue Jun 9 11:03:31 2015 UTC,"Reviews can be edited and changed as time goes on. As the game stands in its current state this user decided that the lack of playerbase was a big enough issue to not recommend it. What you are saying seems far more illogical to me honestly. We should review games based on what the devs intend? We should review games based on what could have happened or what will happen? I simply don't get how reviewing a game based on what I think will happen to it in the future is valid. Besides, the reviewer might come back and change his review in the future once more people start playing, and his review won't matter anyways once the game leaves early access. So what is the point in recommending a game based on the promises of the future?  You are saying you would rather have him deceive people and tell them to get the game even though he couldn't enjoy it? You are telling him to write a false review about his experiences so that his experiences might change? In my eyes, that is just another abuse of the system."
AirBrawl,391fjm,ViciousLooRoll,6,Tue Jun 9 11:20:26 2015 UTC,"A review should highlight the experience of the player. The danger when creating a multiplayer-only game is that the experience of the user is reliant on the activity of the community. Not recommending a multiplayer game because not enough people are playing to have a good time is valid, imo.   It's an early access review, which means it won't really matter once the game is fully released. For now, it accurately describes this player's experience."
AirBrawl,391fjm,sakkarozglikoz,2,Mon Jun 8 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"I mean, if a game is absolutely amazing, but the community is literally so toxic (beyond lol/dota/csgo level) that its unplayable, then im not going to play it or give a good review, because it's the developer's responsibility to make sure that there are more players."
AirBrawl,391fjm,professorpan,45,Mon Jun 8 22:28:36 2015 UTC,0.2 hours of gameplay......
AirBrawl,391fjm,mrepic13,6,Mon Jun 8 17:13:00 2015 UTC,That's about 12 minutes. 12...
AirBrawl,391fjm,ViciousLooRoll,3,Tue Jun 9 14:33:11 2015 UTC,"That person probably shows up to house parties at 7:00pm, and leaves after 12 minutes because ""this party sucks nobody's there""."

AirBrawl,391fjm,ViciousLooRoll,3,Tue Jun 9 05:58:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you played it for 12 minutes, refunded it, and decided to persuade others not to get it... using your 12 minutes worth of knowledge.   what a loser"
AirBrawl,391fjm,mrepic13,-2,Tue Jun 9 14:42:06 2015 UTC,and those were fun 12 minutes indeed.  Of empty servers and slow game-play because of my crap computer.
AirBrawl,391fjm,tupendous,3,Tue Jun 9 17:29:47 2015 UTC,So... bad review because bad computer? Nice...
AirBrawl,391fjm,Spore2012,-5,Tue Jun 9 18:32:34 2015 UTC,"no, bad review because empty servers.  again, stop being so butthurt about this."
AirBrawl,391fjm,Coffeeist,1 point,Tue Jun 9 18:42:57 2015 UTC,"i appreciate the review, i was going to buy this but if nobody plays it it'd just be a waste of money."
AirBrawl,391fjm,NoteBlock08,8,Sun Jun 28 05:07:21 2015 UTC,This is the overwhelming problem with early access games. They run their course before they are even released.
AirBrawl,391fjm,NoteBlock08,5,Mon Jun 8 22:05:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with most of the points ITT.  Obviously an online-only game not having many players is something very useful to know when buying the game... it tells a potential buyer that they shouldn't expect to have a plethora of full servers online and ready for them, and that rather they often may not be able to find a usable server at all. That's useful stuff to know when debating whether to risk money on it.  That said, I agree with OP on two points: 1) For an extremely new game (such as this), low player-count is pretty much par for the course I would say. One could even argue, perhaps, that few players is to be expected in such a new game. It's still worth noting, of course, but at this early time, I personally don't feel player-base should factor into a recommendation so much. 2) Personally, if I see a ""not-recommended"" icon, I assume it means that they game itself is bad. Yes, I fully realize that ""not-recommended"" does not equal or imply ""bad"" but I'm also sure I'm not the only one who is put off a bit subconsciously after seeing a big red thumbs-down.  To sum up, I guess I'm just pointing out the downside of a two-sided system like is there... especially with the semantics of calling it recommended/not-recommended in place of good/bad. It would be nice if you could more clearly rate a game as good/bad, but point out issues that are out of the developer's hands (such as playerbase) in a more distinct way... unfortunately that also runs the risk of slipping the review system into an overcomplicated mess."
AirBrawl,391fjm,th1341,14,Tue Jun 9 04:44:13 2015 UTC,Then shouldn't he be marking it as recommended so more people would play and solve his problem?
AirBrawl,391fjm,th1341,-7,Mon Jun 8 20:54:30 2015 UTC,Yes that's the point which people are somehow missing.
AirBrawl,391fjm,th1341,-9,Tue Jun 9 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"I find it really weird that the leading opinion about this review in the comment section on a post in /r/AirBrawl is ""Oh yeah no, it's totally ok to give a budding early access game a bad score because it doesn't have many players yet.""

AirBrawl,391fjm,GorgeWashington,10,Tue Jun 9 04:43:53 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with it either, but I think you're getting a bit too hung up on this man."

If it werent, then no multiplayer game could ever take off let alone have a good score because all of the first reviewers would complain about the lack of users and give it a negative score. its mind boggingly ludicrous.  Wil: Hey guys Im working on a game, please tell me what you think.  User: Its ok but nobody is playing it.  Wil: I know, its brand new. Recommend it to your friends so there are more players!  User: Sorry, cant recommend, not enough players.  This isnt just a comment about the lack of users, its a strike against the games score. If a game is brand new and in early access its a givin that there arent many people playing it yet. Steam has one metric which is used to determine the quality of a game, one score."

Only problem I foresee is Sniper. Also, just wondering, why do people want Harbour to be called Ship? I think the name suits the map. On the veteran/newbie game segregation, it could be based off of KDR. I can obviously see that this can be abused, but that only makes it worse for you since you are put into a higher skill level. Basically, <1.0 KDR = Newbie, and >1.0KDR = Veteran? On a further topic, there could be 'Stats' implemented. A player chart of their kills, deaths, KDR, highest kills with x plane, highest deaths with x plane, best game, worst game, etc. Just a suggestion if you want more competition in the community. And another thing, there could be guilds. I know there are teams in MLAB, so sort of the same thing. Maybe a guild name that's displayed beneath/above your real name. You can be alerted if someone in your guild is playing a game so you can join them, and et cetera. Guilds are joinable(?) through invite, and can be created by any player. To avoid abuse, you could limit it to creating guilds once a week, and joining them once a day. Oh. Another thing. For global rankings, you could just sector them by region, then by global, and have it based off of KDR, or kills per day/week/month/all time. If I get the time, I'll format this much better."

I got the 1000 kill achievement and only had 39 wins. 10 000, 100 000, and maybe a 500 000 kill achievement would be cool (~25 per game, 50% winrate means you would get 10 000 wins and 500 000 kills at the same time)."

What might also be nice would be different damage markers.  Right now, whenever you deal damage to an enemy, your crosshairs change to a hitmarker.  It might be better if this marker differentiated between different types of damage - so you could tell, for instance, if there was an enemy caught in your Toxic Gas, or if you had tagged that guy with a Dart."

All the characters were extremely flat. Kirito was the angstiest motherfucker around. And the whole asuna rape thing was just fucked up.

It's a fun ride that looks pretty and has some badass action scenes with amazing music. Yeah, I have some major problems with the second half of the season (really, make Asuna nothing more than a princess in a literal birdcage? Come on, she was badass, now she's just a goal) but am still able to enjoy it for what it is.  Life's more fun if you overlook faults and enjoy things for what they are."

AirBrawl,38zzud,hawkman561,3,Tue Jun 9 03:22:35 2015 UTC,"Second half of season two was still the author's early stage. The series was really just supposed to be from floor 74 up to the point that he finishes the game, but after popular demand he wrote the beginning, then Alfheim, and after that the writing got a little better. GGO was fantastic for most people, others don't like it, Calibur was a great short arc, and Mother's Rosario is where he first starts getting more mature with his writing. After that the story is fantastic, you should really watch season two if you haven't yet. It's nothing like Alfheim was."

AirBrawl,393sii,venicello,6,Tue Jun 9 01:33:11 2015 UTC,"A decent nerf might be just making the gravity bomb drop behind you, rather than firing it. This would mean you can't aim it so it fires someone into a wall, and means that you could escape pursuers to get more range - something the sharpshooter needs"
AirBrawl,393sii,Yosepi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 10:10:24 2015 UTC,"This seems perfect: I also think the thermal scope needs to have its range nerfed, or something"
AirBrawl,393sii,ArkEneru,2,Tue Jun 9 16:21:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like that would make it useless, there was a bug where it had a range and it just didn't feel right  Maybe make it so you can't shoot while in the thermal scope, you can only line it up?   I know that I still use it a lot just for tracking enemies when we're in the tournaments so I can tell my teammate what's going on"
AirBrawl,393sii,Yosepi,2,Tue Jun 9 16:50:15 2015 UTC,Or that you can only use the sniper while scoped.
AirBrawl,393sii,Najda,1 point,Wed Jun 10 04:10:57 2015 UTC,"That was also a bug briefly, which I quite liked   But I think as people have said it's the knockback more than the damage"
AirBrawl,393sii,Yosepi,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:01:40 2015 UTC,"I think instead that it should only show you enemies. No terrain, no buildings. So you can't tell if there's stuff in between you and you have to leave it to do any sort of manoeuvring."
AirBrawl,393sii,individualsovereign,2,Thu Jun 11 09:38:37 2015 UTC,"Nice writeup, I agree that map design could be improved, especially NEON where you can get sniped directly after spawn."
AirBrawl,393sii,I11111,2,Tue Jun 9 01:48:30 2015 UTC,"The sharpshoot definitely is overpowered in it's current state. It was the first plane I used and I was getting at least half of my teams total kills, and this was before I knew you could use the alternate zoom for snipe. It would be very smart to have it almost useless in close encounters, but when you talk about gravity bomb the same could be said with air cannon. If you are anywhere close to a structure they can just blast you into it."
AirBrawl,393sii,Emorigg,2,Tue Jun 9 03:15:36 2015 UTC,"I would say Air Cannon is actually better than Gravity Bomb due to the range, and needing to be nearby. Also, consider the fact the cannon will shove your plane backwards if you're too close to a wall; Using it underground or near buildings, such as Harbor's town area, will typically kill both the user and the target if one's not careful, since the rebound can shove you into a wall. It's also more flexible, as you can use it for movement options.   One of my biggest gripes with the gravity bomb is if you get sucked in, there really isn't any escaping it, even if you teleport out. I've used lightbringer to teleport away before it finished, yet I still get sucked back in from a massive distance, then slingshotted into the ground. Same with the Elder and Witch Doctor's turbo boost."
AirBrawl,393sii,42nd_hitchhiker,1 point,Tue Jun 9 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"The teleporting thing was fixed, but then Wil buffed the gravity bomb and it seems to be back  Not sure whether it's a bug but it was better when teleporting/boosting out let you escape"
AirBrawl,393sii,Yosepi,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:51:45 2015 UTC,"Well, yeah.  Air cannon is a great up-close weapon.  It's good on the Fatbird, whose thing appears to be versatility.  Giving the Sharpshooter an air cannon would be weird and a bad idea."
AirBrawl,393sii,Emorigg,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:16:08 2015 UTC,"I meant that gravity bomb and air cannon are equally overpowered when used around structures. The only thing that puts Sharpshooter over the edge is snipe because of its high damage, range, and knock-back."
AirBrawl,393sii,RimeboundNinja,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:37:33 2015 UTC,"I agree as well. I personally love the Sharp Shooter. Nerfing it would really put a damper on it's gameplay, but I find that I usually depend on one snipe, and a few shots from DMR to kill the person. I think it would be fine if knockback was nerfed, since it's pointless in an open area anyway. Although, I don't agree with nerfing it in close range. I know that it's overpowered, and I like that, haha, but I wouldn't really consider it 'overpowered' in close range. I get if you're chasing someone through tunnels that gravity bomb is almost a surefire kill, but in a close dogfight, Sharp Shooter won't usually win, against a player with equal skill. The Fatbird, for example, is just as overpowered in close range as Sharp Shooter is in long range with Air Cannon and Shotgun. The Witch Doctor's Gas 'blinds' the Sharp Shooter's Snipe, so that's not that bad either, and it's deadly going into a close combat against a Witch Doctor with gas. We already know that Hammers are pretty much a 1HKO when fully charged, so that can get out of the way, and Elder still has a lot of work to be done, but it's still excellent with a fully charged adaptive strike. Cyber Priest is fairly weak in both far/close range (better in middle), but it excels in healing, and can be very hard to kill against an experienced player."
AirBrawl,393sii,notyetawizard,1 point,Tue Jun 9 05:52:34 2015 UTC,"I think the most OP part of the Sharpshooter is actually that it gives you the ability to distinguish teams from a reasonable distance. With the sniper equipped, I never waste time shooting at my teammates.   That said, the problem is not the sniper, but the ui for everything else :P"
AirBrawl,393sii,notyetawizard,1 point,Tue Jun 9 22:05:09 2015 UTC,"You know, that gives me an idea.  What if the Sharpshooter's special was the ability to ""tag"" enemies with a marker of some sort?  Maybe with a cooldown of like 1 second, and tagged enemies glowed and could be seen through walls or something.  Tagging would last 5-10 seconds."
AirBrawl,392r4n,Najda,7,Mon Jun 8 20:54:03 2015 UTC,"Some sort of single player campain to train people in controlling their plane better. Sort of like an extended tutorial, these could be time trial maps with the objective of reaching the finish line. There could be different difficulties, and it can inculde different elements of existing maps. Including buttons you have to shoot to open a door or similar would help with introducing aiming while flying. This game mode would have a double benifit of helping new players aclimate to the game, but also be a fun addition to the game for veterans as well.   The drawback is it would take people out of the multiplayer games, but if there were simply seperate racing servers then it will stil make the game feel populated. This could be done like cs:go surfing servers, where you can't shoot eachother, and every time you cross the finish line your time is posted and you get some points according to rank."
AirBrawl,392r4n,Whizzmaster,3,Mon Jun 8 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"People should have an option to tag a game as an ""Inexperienced"" server or an ""Experienced"" server.

AirBrawl,392r4n,RimeboundNinja,2,Mon Jun 8 21:45:40 2015 UTC,"Basic skill level queue. This would be after you press quick match, you can select ""new player"" or ""veteran"" to be put in a respective game. This might help with the problem, but it has obvious draw backs of nothing being in place to prevent a good player from joining the new player game.   A variation of this would just leave quickmatch as it is, but have a veterans game labeled as such, available only through the Browse Server."

AirBrawl,38wg53,FrederikTheDane,6,Mon Jun 8 00:48:12 2015 UTC,How many times did you get accused of hacking?
AirBrawl,38wg53,Cowgus,7,Sun Jun 7 12:22:17 2015 UTC,"Not even once, the times people said that was when I entangled multiple people and adaptive strike was OP enough to kill all of them"
AirBrawl,38wg53,Healthyspartan,5,Sun Jun 7 12:23:31 2015 UTC,Entangle OP ;)
AirBrawl,38wg53,callmebrick,2,Sun Jun 7 15:41:30 2015 UTC,"You used the shotgun, right?"
AirBrawl,38wg53,Whizzmaster,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:57:56 2015 UTC,Adaptive Strike/Entangle
AirBrawl,38y74w,Hardtim3r,8,Sun Jun 7 21:16:25 2015 UTC,If snipers never came into the brawls then they would just be even more annoying  The only reason they don't make people rage quit is because no one currently just stays right on the edge of the map being a nob  Your 'nerf' would make the sniper super annoying
AirBrawl,38y74w,Yosepi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:51:53 2015 UTC,"Not really, you're not realizing the fact that you HAVE TO fly forward and you're in the middle in seconds. This only gives you one shot if you want to turn back every time. Slow flying is no option because you fall downwards if you do."
AirBrawl,38y74w,Yosepi,3,Sun Jun 7 21:53:49 2015 UTC,"You can definitely stall and fire, and I'm sure many people will just take one shot and turn back. Otherwise they'll fly into the middle and get murdered since they can't fight very well"
AirBrawl,38y74w,RimeboundNinja,2,Sun Jun 7 21:56:02 2015 UTC,Why don't people do that now then? Because it's OP at close range. As I said it wouldn't get buffed at a further range. Only nerfed at a closer.
AirBrawl,38y74w,RimeboundNinja,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:59:19 2015 UTC,"As I said it wouldn't get buffed at a further range.  The further snipe gets shot from the enemy the more knockback and damage it does.   Still confusing, haha. Also, people do do that. And everything is OP at close range. Hammers, Adaptive Strike, Shotgun, Poison Gas, Tether, etc."
AirBrawl,38y74w,DrFino,1 point,Sun Jun 7 22:12:46 2015 UTC,"See it like this, the maximum amount of dmg and knockback you can achieve if this gets implemented, is the amount of dmg it does now. Doesn't have to be very far, but just far enough that it nerfs the close range knockback. The damage isn't op, the knockback is."
AirBrawl,38y74w,RimeboundNinja,2,Sun Jun 7 22:16:26 2015 UTC,"Ah, alright. It was kind of confusing the way you worded it, but I get it now. Like I said earlier, I'm still against this, but I can see why one would want this to happen."
AirBrawl,38y74w,RimeboundNinja,9,Sun Jun 7 22:18:11 2015 UTC,"Just add a charge mechanic that increases the shot power when you zoom in. ""Hip"" fire will do minimum dmg, a 1-2 second zoom will do max. Like TF2."
AirBrawl,38y74w,iamthedisk4,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:54:05 2015 UTC,I like this idea
AirBrawl,38y74w,RimeboundNinja,6,Mon Jun 8 14:04:42 2015 UTC,"I can't possibly understand how you think this is a nerf, or how it makes it more realistic."
AirBrawl,38y74w,Cowgus,2,Sun Jun 7 21:18:44 2015 UTC,Make the furthest distance like how it is now. Snipe from close range is very overpowered. This makes it more realistic because people will be using snipe from a much further range. That makes it like a real sniper.
AirBrawl,38y74w,ArkEneru,1 point,Sun Jun 7 21:23:01 2015 UTC,"You didn't say that close range would be nerfed, just that far range would be buffed, but alright, I see what you mean. I personally don't like it, since I love noscoping people, and it would become obsolete at close range, but I understand your point of view."

AirBrawl,38wjir,ArkEneru,10,Sun Jun 7 12:55:24 2015 UTC,Agreed.
AirBrawl,38wjir,FrederikTheDane,6,Sun Jun 7 13:07:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like some form of regeneration would be good for this game, as you've said  However, putting 'powerups' around the map will just make it feel like another generic arcadey shooter, and that isn't what I think the game should aim to be  I'm not sure what would be good, I'm quite liking the current regen but there are some problems with it. I disagree with your last point, I think regen is better, but I think neither is the answer we're after. Unfortunately I'm not a game designer and have no idea what might work"
AirBrawl,38wjir,Yosepi,6,Sun Jun 7 13:08:18 2015 UTC,"Also, with the current regen I know that after I've injured someone I need to chase them if they run away, otherwise the damage I've done will be healed  This encourages chases rewarding skilful flying"
AirBrawl,38wjir,Yosepi,3,Sun Jun 7 13:10:42 2015 UTC,"Well, its the same with health packs. They will be able to find a health pickup and heal if you don't chase them. I feel like the above point is moot: both systems of resupplying your health require you to finish off your enemies."
AirBrawl,38wjir,Yosepi,2,Sun Jun 7 13:21:39 2015 UTC,"With health pickups you'd know where the person you were chasing was headed, which I guess might provide a sense of urgency, but with regen you just need to shake off whoever's chasing you, allowing you to take more creative routes  On that same note, health pickups might lead to parts of the maps being unused, as you'd want to fight near to the health pickups so that you can pick them up quickly and also so that you can prevent your enemies getting to them"
AirBrawl,38wjir,sayaks,0,Sun Jun 7 13:35:18 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand the 'shake off whoever's chasing you' bit. I just honestly don't anticipate a difference between evading someone when health packs are implemented vs. shaking someone off while regen is implemented.    On that same note, health pickups might lead to parts of the maps being unused, as you'd want to fight near to the health pickups so that you can pick them up quickly and also so that you can prevent your enemies getting to them   Except parts of the map are already unused, and those unused sections could be filled with health pickups, eliminating the problem. On top of that, health pickups could be frequent, spreading out the combat, if thats what you really want. I personally like the idea of centralized combat in this game. Its AirBrawl, not AirSkirmish"
AirBrawl,38wjir,sayaks,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:51:46 2015 UTC,"Health packs would force people to move away and find some health packs, while regen will let people move away from the fight,  but still be able to participate.      If you chase someone you can know where they are going because they have to be going towards health packs, with regen their only goal is to evade your fire and as such they will be more unpredictable.      Regen favors those who can avoid fire consistently, while packs reward those who can avoid fatal damage and those who knows the map."
AirBrawl,38wjir,sayaks,0,Sun Jun 7 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"Health packs would force people to move away and find some health packs, while regen will let people move away from the fight, but still be able to participate.   Health packs won't prevent players from participating in the fight though."
AirBrawl,38wjir,Yosepi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:21:25 2015 UTC,"I guess, but it would make people more likely to search for health packs than keep fighting once they're damaged."
AirBrawl,38wjir,Yosepi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:27:44 2015 UTC,"if they keep fighting whilst damaged, they won't regen anyways"

AirBrawl,38wjir,RimeboundNinja,0,Sun Jun 7 17:56:44 2015 UTC,"generic arcadey shooter   When did those become generic? I feel like moving in the opposite direction, like something more like war thunder, is more generic than an arcadey shooter."
AirBrawl,38wjir,TinyHadronCollider,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:09:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's not true, but I have this idea in my head of ""indie game arcade shooter""  Cool art style, pickups around the map, some fun weapons but ultimately very similar to any other ""indie game arcade shooter"""
AirBrawl,38wjir,ImaNarwhal,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:12:13 2015 UTC,"Do you have examples? That sounds like the 'generic modern military shooter' trope, with some of the requirements changed.  Even then, I feel like adding health pickups is  a. not enough to give an 'arcadey' feel anymore than AirBrawl is already an 'arcadey' shooter  b. the need for health pickups as a gameplay choice transcends any risk of becoming 'arcadey'"
AirBrawl,38wjir,SirMStachio,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:17:03 2015 UTC,"I don't have any examples, which is why I said maybe it isn't true, just the feeling I get. And it basically is the 'generic modern military shooter' trope, that doesn't mean it isn't a valid point  I don't feel like health pickups are needed over the current regen, it seems fine to me. I don't think it will create areas people defend, because the maps are too big and the teams too small"
AirBrawl,38wjir,ImaNarwhal,1 point,Sun Jun 7 13:32:22 2015 UTC,I never said they were needed. Needed is a strong word. It just encourages more fun and strategic gameplay.   Source 1  Source 2
AirBrawl,38wjir,SirMStachio,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:00:13 2015 UTC,"I agree that regen health isn't great, but I do think they're better than health pickups for this game  As I said before I think neither is the answer, but can't think of what could be implemented. All that's coming to mind is perks where you could pick regen, but that's fucking stupid"
AirBrawl,38wjir,ImaNarwhal,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"I disagree: the game would be better with health packs than no regen whatsoever, and health packs are especially better than natural regen."
AirBrawl,38wjir,SirMStachio,1 point,Sun Jun 7 14:05:40 2015 UTC,"With health packs, it is much more harder to survive than regen. This makes it especially hard for new players, as it would likely only take a few shots from any plane to kill you, considering you have low enough health to back away from a fight and go to a health pack. Regen also requires skill, as you need to be not hit/attacked whatsoever to survive, and as /u/Yosenpai said, it still allows you to stay in the fight"
AirBrawl,38wjir,Its-M4RC05,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:35:49 2015 UTC,"No, I'm not buying the 'allows you to keep fighting' bit. You can choose to regen or you can choose to fight. You can't do both. It would be impossible for anybody to not get hit even once while in a fight. What you're saying is ridiculous"
AirBrawl,38wjir,OrangeSlime,2,Sun Jun 7 19:45:12 2015 UTC,I wholeheartedly support this idea.

AirBrawl,38ufba,RimeboundNinja,4,Sat Jun 6 22:33:44 2015 UTC,I don't think Wil's goals should be getting a huge playerbase while it's still this early in the lifespan of the game. You want people to gain interest when the game is close to done. Right now it's better to have people playing that are genuinely interested in the fact that it's early access and an evolving game.
AirBrawl,38ufba,JimJimster,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:43:50 2015 UTC,"eh, IMO a huge playerbase could be the best thing to happen to this, because then bugs get caught faster, there's more publicity, more money rolling in for it, more game."

AirBrawl,38su8l,ArkEneru,1 point,Sat Jun 6 18:52:53 2015 UTC,One suggestion: the music is a little loud to be chill. In the future I recommend setting the volume at like 75% or 50% of this.
AirBrawl,38su8l,Maser-kun,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:40:55 2015 UTC,"Just lower your volume? There is only music, so there's not any balance issues or something like that."

AirBrawl,38pzby,albinobluesheep,8,Fri Jun 5 21:30:33 2015 UTC,"That's a crap ton of exposure. I was hoping one of the big guys would do a review or stream it. Wonder what the limit of dedicatef server hosting system Wilnyl is using is. If 30k people saw a good impression of it, we might finally break that 100 player peak (peaked at 69 so far)"
AirBrawl,38pzby,Najda,5,Fri Jun 5 23:08:09 2015 UTC,I think (hope!) he might give it another go on another night stream.

AirBrawl,38pzby,Hatefiend,-14,Sat Jun 6 19:37:40 2015 UTC,"LET ME REPHRASE ALL OF WHATS BELOW:  One of the most popular streamers on twitch along with his friend group, plus ~30,000 people watching, disliked your video game and got bored after a few matches. You're telling me you're going to shrug that off and claim that he didn't give it a chance and that nothing major should be changed?   ~~~~~~~~~~  Lirik hated it and I definitely agree with what he said. This game need serious work on the mechanics/game-play aspects instead of maps/skins/ascetics and new abilities. Games are not supposed to be fun only when you grind out 10-100 games to get the hang of it. A game should be fun/easy to learn and hard/painful to master. If you disagree with me, go download Twitch Rechat for Chrome and look at chat's reaction to the game. 30,000 viewers and there was not much hype whatsoever over this game.   Hope the author of the game realizes this and makes some changes.   Edit: Anyone typing names of games as examples and explaining that they have a huge difficulty curve and are vastly popular completely missed the idea behind my post."
AirBrawl,38pzby,CJNC,16,Sat Jun 6 09:44:14 2015 UTC,"there's plenty of games that take off with a learning curve,  counter-strike  dota  war thunder  chivalry  overgrowth  no more room in hell  killing floor  arma  many racing games  etc etc, anyways just because a game is hard doesn't mean it's not good"
AirBrawl,38pzby,Hatefiend,-9,Sat Jun 6 10:42:47 2015 UTC,You are completely misinterpreting my post.
AirBrawl,38pzby,CJNC,3,Sat Jun 6 10:48:39 2015 UTC,how so?
AirBrawl,38pzby,Hatefiend,-5,Sat Jun 6 12:01:06 2015 UTC,"In Chivalry, you spawn in and it's fairly easy to understand what is happening around you. Same with Counter Strike and many of the examples you listed. The difference is that, if you watch the vod of Liric, he was getting shot from people he couldn't even see. He was getting stunned, disoriented, levitated by abilities he had no idea existed. Honestly I sympathized with him during the gameplay because he was right; to a new player, you're only reaction is 'wtf is happening, how did I die?, who shot me?, wtf he can do that?'.   There are games that obvious are insanely popular and fail at this as well, but what Liric showed is a new players' perspective and he was clearly unhappy, and so was most of chat."
AirBrawl,38pzby,CJNC,9,Sat Jun 6 12:11:22 2015 UTC,"counter strike, you spawn in and you don't know where the enemies can show up, you don't know that you have to counter recoil, you don't know how to move efficiently. chivalry, you have to time blocks and attacks to be able to kill your opponent without losing 70% of your health. in chivalry, you can get shot by a javelin and not know what happened or how you died. in counter strike you can get shot through smoke grenades randomly, shot in the side, back, and front. there are tutorials for each game, with air brawl it's still in alpha i think so there's no actual tutorial. reviewing a beta game as if it was full release isn't fair. it's liriks fault he played a game just released by an indie dev and criticizes it as if it wasn't early access."
AirBrawl,38pzby,Maelorian,-8,Sat Jun 6 12:45:18 2015 UTC,You need to take a step back and analyze these games from a whole new perspective to understand what I'm talking about. I'm not going to sit here and argue with you what certain intrinsic qualities certain games have that may or may not be confusing to new players. If you do not understand that AirBrawl has a massive problem in its' gameplay that needs serious attention then you are ignorant to your surroundings.

AirBrawl,38pzby,Maelorian,8,Sat Jun 6 12:56:24 2015 UTC,"At this point, your mad that some games require more skill to play than others.  Mechanics don't make games easier to play.  Skill does.   Lirik is not going to pick up this game and be a god.   He's human. He has to learn."
AirBrawl,38pzby,Maelorian,-5,Sat Jun 6 14:45:06 2015 UTC,"Sorry, that's wrong. I play StarCraft 2 and achieved master rank. That's top 2% of players. Hell, I want this game to be infinitely complex and take insane strategy.   But here's the bottom line.   Lirik didn't have fun. His friends didn't have fun. They played it for around 30 minutes. A game by today's standards should be fun by that amount of time (it's called building a good first impression). You want to WOW the player right from the start. I am saying Air Brawl doesn't do this currently (AND NOT just because it's in alpha, this is not something that will be solved with new abilities, planes, or maps)."
AirBrawl,38pzby,Hatefiend,4,Sat Jun 6 14:59:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah and I play league of Legends and I'm challenger.  Anywho, he got shit stomped by other players and that's not our problem. It's his.   Hey I was the same, I joined the game and I fucking sucked. But I loved it, so I kept playing.  Lirik played one game and gave up. His experience was abruptly ended by more experienced players. If he really wanted to enjoy the game, start up a small 2v2 server and slowly build up. Instead of flying into the fuckfest he entered.  The way you are making it sound is that he should pick up Airbrawl, and kick the ass of every player in that server.  And you want Airbrawl to be COMPLEX? The whole BEAUTY in this game is its simplicity, in a world where the best games are largely sophisticated, this is a breath of fresh air. A game that requires no strategy, no mechanics, just pure player skill."
AirBrawl,38pzby,Maelorian,3,Sat Jun 6 15:05:39 2015 UTC,"This is expected. He's new. He may be up against people (such as me) who've played this game for months now, and know each crevice, every speed, and damage model of his weapons.   This is not an issue for the game, nor it is Lirik's, it's just that he played against players BETTER than him.   I watched the VOD. He does nothing but fly in a straight line. Of course he's going to get shot."
AirBrawl,38pzby,intoxbodmansvs,-5,Sat Jun 6 14:41:13 2015 UTC,This is not an issue for the game   I frankly disagree. My responses all in this post should explain a bit more why but it's taxing to type it all over again.
AirBrawl,38pzby,iwannastudy,3,Sat Jun 6 15:10:29 2015 UTC,Problem with the game? I don't see it like that. Simply a discrepancy in player skill level. I mean you'd expect it from a person that plays H1Z1 and ARMA 3 all day.
AirBrawl,38pzby,ksaid1,2,Sat Jun 6 15:13:30 2015 UTC,"The first step of any new player should be to review what he has available to him in his arsenal, which is the same for everyone.  You can't jump in and expect to be good from the start"
AirBrawl,38pzby,Maelorian,6,Sat Jun 6 17:54:41 2015 UTC,Have you heard of DOTA 2 and League of legends? Most people dont even know the mechanics completely even after 100-200 games.. These games are also the most played games in the world( LoL being the most played ever). DOTA 2  even has a 11 million dollar prize for winning in one of its tournament..
AirBrawl,38pzby,Mein_Kappa,5,Sat Jun 6 11:33:10 2015 UTC,This game need serious work on the mechanics/game-play aspects    Sounds like it needs    a tutorial maybe it should show a re-play of how you died   Making serious changes to the game mechanics just so that new players will understand things easier doesn't really seem like a viable option.   Unless you have like specific examples of what you're talking about
AirBrawl,38pzby,Hatefiend,4,Sat Jun 6 15:27:04 2015 UTC,"mechanics  gameplay aspects   Fuck do you want us to do?  Learn how to Kite in Airbrawl?

I dont know much about linux but previously someone managed it fix it pretty easily. But if you cant be bothered steam just updated their refund policy so it should be easy to get your money back if its broken

AirBrawl,38o4d8,Not83,7,Fri Jun 5 14:38:18 2015 UTC,I could have sworn there was an old post on the sub with someone with the same error and someone else in the comments telling him a command he could run to get the proper fonts.

AirBrawl,38o4d8,zipy124,18,Fri Jun 5 14:50:08 2015 UTC,"Okay, I figured it out. The package is called gnu-free-fonts in manjaro repositories.

AirBrawl,38r4vs,Flippy28,10,Sat Jun 6 02:42:01 2015 UTC,One thing I found to be quite helpful was to practice with every weapon and plane. I'm the sort of fellow who would just pick one type of weapon/plane and play it until my fingers fall off. But regularly using all of the weapons and planes helped me understand the their limits. You can try changing weapons and planes every time you die to help you practice.

I wish the hammers did a bit more damage (I feel like getting a 3-5 second charged smash off should OHKO). My strategy revolves around tight flying to ambush people. Most kills come by knocking them into a wall or the ground, or the obvious frost missile > charged hammer combo. Having previous experience in games like TF2 helps tremendously with the frost missile aiming.  I wish I could record some of the more exciting kills I've gotten so far. Anchor whiplash into charged hammer is so fun.  If I get caught from behind my main strategy is to either weave between buildings or go for the immediate U turn and hope I can hit a hammer."

Between the overall damage (enough to one-shot the Cyber Priest and Sharpshooter) and the kinetic force applied, the hammers are in a good spot (imo). If nothing else, forcing a player into terrain will kill them regardless of what plane they're in."
AirBrawl,38r4vs,ShadowRaven6,1 point,Sat Jun 6 15:10:42 2015 UTC,"I wonder how much damage a charged hit does. Maybe I should have been using double hit instead when I have a guaranteed hit. The damage is good where it is at, don't get me wrong - I just get salty when I do a drive by charged hammer (in the sky away from walls) and they just tumble a bit then fly away. Follow ups are very difficult in that situation. Even trying out Swarm instead of Frost Missiles didn't provide useful enough to give up the CC."
AirBrawl,38r4vs,dkwz,2,Sat Jun 6 15:37:44 2015 UTC,"Each hammer deals 50 damage, regardless of whether it's charged (last I checked anyways). The advantage of charging the hammers is that you can swing both at once for a burst of up to 100 damage and the lunge forward."
AirBrawl,38r4vs,ShadowRaven6,3,Sat Jun 6 17:34:41 2015 UTC,"Combos hurt a ton.  I've been flying the Cyber Priest and if you can hit a sword(or both to hit triggering the sword from above) it makes using the primary weapon, Light Bringer or Orbital Smite much easier.  Also, I played the game a bit before the Steam launch, so I would recommend starting a one person server and explore the maps, get a general feel for them, and work on flying in tight spaces."
AirBrawl,38r4vs,Ekmod,1 point,Sat Jun 6 04:19:20 2015 UTC,everyone in a server was cyber priest and those swords got irritating real fast.  basically once you get hit with one you're open to a barrage of the others :(
AirBrawl,38r4vs,AccordingIy,1 point,Sat Jun 6 09:01:38 2015 UTC,"With the swords you need to fire them as often as possible. I didn't realise for a while how short the cooldown was, I think you can keep someone permanently immobilised with them"
AirBrawl,38r4vs,Yosepi,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:58:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The fire rate of both Swords and Orbital Smite's little balls needs to be reduce. As it is now, they fire as fast as you can click."
AirBrawl,38r4vs,Ekmod,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:24:58 2015 UTC,"Frankly, I don't think the Cyber Priest is the most op plane right now... cough cough, Sharp Shooter, cough cough, freakin Viking.  :)"

AirBrawl,38r4vs,ArkEneru,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:37:48 2015 UTC,But air cannon hopping tho
AirBrawl,38r4vs,Hyoioyh,1 point,Sat Jun 6 20:01:28 2015 UTC,The orbital smite is only really has a dangerously high fire rate if you're flying slowly or in a straight line consistently.

AirBrawl,38r4vs,ArkEneru,1 point,Sat Jun 6 16:38:35 2015 UTC,"However they don't do THAT much damage unless you land the full combo, and even if you do that doesn't 1 shot a lot of the classes. Meanwhile basically every other load out will one shot everything."
AirBrawl,38r4vs,Gemini_19,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"Holy shit why haven't I thought of this......  I've been spamming orbital smite first. With the new speed of the planes and the sword projectile, it made it a little harder to actually land the triple sword of death so I've been abandoning my favorite combo. But I guess I'll try this out again."
AirBrawl,38r4vs,Gemini_19,3,Sat Jun 6 23:24:16 2015 UTC,"One thing I've found that's super important: If you're being harassed with long range weapons like the sniper or light bringer, try to lay low. I've seen a ton of players fly around near the top of the map and get sniped out of the sky, but staying near buildings and weaving into tunnels for flanking purposes both keeps you alive and puts you in a prime position for counterattack. Even in flat maps like sand, flying in the dunes provides good cover against enemy sightlines."
AirBrawl,38r4vs,Hyoioyh,2,Sat Jun 6 20:10:44 2015 UTC,This is a surefire dick move. Spawn camp with Sharp Shooter using DMR and Sniper.
AirBrawl,38r4vs,RimeboundNinja,2,Sat Jun 6 04:37:58 2015 UTC,"Or spawn with a witch doctor and gas immediately in death match or flagmaster, ive avoided doing that because its pretty unsportsmanlike"
AirBrawl,38r4vs,sharktopuskracken,2,Sat Jun 6 17:40:15 2015 UTC,Haha. I'm pretty sure you can win flagmaster by just staying underground and gassing at regular intervals.
AirBrawl,38r4vs,RimeboundNinja,2,Sat Jun 6 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Toxic Gas is god.  It's less effective in Harbor than it is in the other maps, because Harbor doesn't really have tunnels.  However, even in Harbor, Toxic Gas is god.  It's got some cool uses.  First, most obviously, it's a trap.  Fly down a tunnel (the center of Sand, for instance) trailing purple death behind you.  Enemies that survive will be easy pickings for you in the bottom.  Second, it plays the dogfight game very well.  The principle goal of any one-on-one battle is to get behind the other guy and throw shit at him until he dies.  Toxic Gas reverses the dynamic, and lets you run your opponent ragged whether he is in front of or behind you.  Third, it's eyes in the back of your head.  You know how your crosshairs change to a hitmarker whenever you deal an enemy damage?  Yeah, that happens when an enemy wanders into your gas.  Watch the center of your screen just after spraying.  If the marker pops up, get ready for a fight.  Remember, Toxic Gas is in essence an area denial weapon.  By spraying, you create areas that your opponent cannot see through or fly through.  Think about where you can spray most effectively to throw them off their game.  (I run Toxic Gas and Harvester.  It's the most resilient Witch Doctor loadout - lets you leech health back fast when you drop low, and spray and pray helps with the getaway.)"
