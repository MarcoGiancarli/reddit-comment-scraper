gifs,3c8yti,toekneeg,"Season 7 Ep 3\n\nIt turns out Barney mastered all the techniques of the trade by going to a night school for it in NJ. He also intentionally conditioned Marshal over years of practice, to associate that restaurant with Barney sneezing. Every time Marshal said ""lets go to shinjitsu"" Barney would sneeze. Then when Marshal finally had something Barney wanted, in this case to touch Lilly's pregnant boobs, he sneezed and Marshal recommended Shinjitsu. After they made the bet all of a sudden he started explaining his plans and how he is a master of the art. Lilly called a deal to let him just see both in the back alley and call the rest off. Barney agrees to that deal. Last minute Marshal stops Lilly and says he is bluffing. Then it cuts to Barney tossing around knives and doing tricks because he wasn't bluffing. Barney does every trick but as he is performing the shrimp in the pocket, Lilly flashes him to distract him and he misses it. He then had to wear that ducky tie for months until he made a new deal with Marshal to trade it in for 3 extra slaps, 2 of which Marshal used immediately."

I’ve tried it and can only get it 1 out of 4 tries, and I’ve seen Benihana chefs flub the manoeuver when they have an entire grill as target. Mads has to crack his eggs into a 8-inch diameter skillet. The props Master calls his guy. The Production Manager calls in his guy. I call my guy. On the morning of the shoot we have 8 dozen eggs and 3 Japanese chefs with their hands made up to be hand doubles.\n\nI guess I don’t have to tell you that when Mads arrives on set, he just tosses an egg up in the air and the egg breaks on the spatula. No problem. Unbelievable. I insist it was a lucky fluke but he does it again. I accuse him of practicing when I wasn’t looking but he laughs (as if he has time to practise egg-cracking between scenes) and tells me he was a juggler in his youth.”\n\n\nfrom Janice Poon's (the show food stylist) blog.\n\n\nEDIT: added link source, MAJOR SPOILER ALERT."

gifs,3c92bd,RCFProd,"That's true but because fps is an average, you can see the spikes and dips with a video around 30.\n\nWith 60 it's totally protected from that. the truth is that you probably couldn't tell 60 from 50, but maybe from 40"
gifs,3c92bd,Chemie93,"Also, are two kinds of spikes and dips. The average frame rate bounces up and down, as you said, which is a variation across multiple frames, but also the timing in between frames is not consistent.  At 30 fps there is 0.033 seconds between each frame. At 60 fps it is 0.017 seconds. Occasionally the rendering will fall behind so it will drop an occasional frame while other frames may get cut short, which means the gap time between frames will bounce around above and below 0.033 seconds. These perturbations are twice as large at 30 fps than 60 fps, so the 60 fps version feels much smoother because the frames are displayed closer to their scheduled display time."

gifs,3c92bd,Reddy_McRedcap,The Japanese team was ranked #4 in the world and had only allowed 3 goals the entire world cup. USA just dominated them the first 20 minutes and Japan wasn't able to come back.
gifs,3c92bd,twittertotter,"http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/olympics/japans-womens-soccer-team-sits-in-economy-while-men-get-first-class\n\nSince women's soccer is an amateur sport, and only started up in the 90's there really isn't the same parity and competitiveness that the men's game has. While Japan is technically ranked #4, that's more of a reflection of just little competition there is in women's soccer than anything else. There is still a huge gulf between the US and everyone else in terms of how seriously women's soccer is taken. Its way more popular in America than the rest of the world, and our girls get way more sponsorship and full time training.\n\nWhile the men's game generates $20+ billion in revenue a year and pays out billions in wages (Ronaldo made $79.50 million last year), the women's game is ameteur or semi-pro at best in most countries. Therefore you don't have the same competitiveness that creates thin margins between success and failure."

America has more registered female soccer players than the rest of the planet combined.\n\nWhile the Japanese team is one of the better teams, women's soccer is such a new thing and so niche that there are still vast discrepancies and lots of lob sided games. Its nothing like the men's game."
gifs,3c92bd,Kraggon,"The USA's best woman athletes play softball, soccer, and basketball mostly.  The USA's best male athletes play basketball, football, and baseball. That is why in soccer that the US womens team will always be very competitive and the US mens team will always be an underdog."
gifs,3c92bd,kcha295,"What always confuses me is for each of those sports you said they mostly seem to need talent that doesn't look like what I'd expect a soccer player to look like. By that I mean basketball needs tall people mostly, football needs big guys mostly, baseball I guess doesn't have a stereotypical body shape to me. But not to disparage the USMNT but considering we do have a full league to attract talent in the US, I feel like we should have more talent playing than we do."
gifs,3c92bd,CrypticTriptych,"You're telling me that a 6'2"" 220 pound running back that can clear the 40 in 4.6 seconds couldn't be a hell of a target man in front of goal? Or a 6'7"" strong forward from Ohio couldn't put in a header like no one's business?"
gifs,3c92bd,kcha295,"Not that they couldn't, they just don't seem to have the frame for it. Also a lot of other sports train for short bursts of power, not long periods of endurance.

gifs,3c8139,little_Nasty,Exactly. I changed my R because the way I'd been taught to write it (like 'r') slowed down the speed at which I could write. A cursive R is a lot more fluid when you're doing joined-up writing (which is standard for where I live). \n\nPretty cool how quickly we adapt.

gifs,3c8139,MrMoth,So just curious.  I love the show white collar.  In the show he says you can copy and signature by turning it upside down because that turns it from words to basically a drawing that you can copy.  \n\nIs there any truth to this if you were a skilled artist?  Or just movie bogus?
gifs,3c8139,HaydenSI,Turning a picture upside down is a really common technique to help beginning artists learn to see what they're drawing without preconceptions. I can see how it would work well for signatures because you would see the shapes better because you would be less focused on the letters.

Go slowly at first and then over time you'll start going a bit faster. But generally just writing slower is the advice. The drawing letters is just to get you in the mind space of pacing yourself."

gifs,3c8139,Angsty_Potatos,"A down stroke (moving the pen toward your body) is usually more likely to curve naturally since thats the way your wrist functions.  So if you want a smooth, less gittery curve pull the pen tip toward you, starting from the top of your curve moving toward your self to the bottom.  To get a less gittery straight line you push the pen away from you as you can see the pen tip better and it helps you make a straighter line."

gifs,3c964o,Appanna,Yes you can.  If 2 players are so far ahead of any defensive player if you pass it backwards to the other player he is still offsides.
gifs,3c964o,Final21,No he (or she) isn't.
gifs,3c964o,procrastaboy,"no, because the two player rule is moot if the ball is behind them.  the rule is the receiving player must be behind two opposing players or behind the ball, whichever is further up the pitch"
gifs,3c964o,littlebrwnrobot,"No, only if you pass it forwards. 2 players can be behind all defenders and pass it backwards but not forwards."
gifs,3c964o,Roymachine,Offside. Not offsides
gifs,3c964o,Smegment,"It wouldn't have mattered, you're right. But drawing a defender makes you part of the play."
gifs,3c964o,torquesteer,"Good on you for doing some research on your own. I will mention something you may not know, in that regardless of the positioning, a player needs not one but two players to hold them from being in an offside position. Usually that second player is the keeper, but not always."
gifs,3c964o,_Hey-Listen_,"Yeah the player in the net doesn't count, but otherwise, nobody is offside anyway? She passes backwards."
gifs,3c964o,Dumbledozer,"Two things:\n\n1.) Offside is determined by being closer to the goal line than the SECOND to last defender.  This is often forgotten because the goal keeper is usually the last defender. So one player in the net with her wouldn't  have kept her from being offside, there would have needed to be two.\n\n2.) By staying in the net, she removed herself from being involved in the play.  It's worth noting though, that while involvement is usually pertaining to coming into contact with the ball or running towards the ball, it doesn't have to.  Say Alex Morgan and the keeper both were in the back of the net.  If Morgan was in front of the keeper and even obstructing her view or her ability to get back involved with the play, she could be ruled as offside.\n\nOffside is a very simple rule that can get tricky.\n\nReference: 13 years of referee experience"
gifs,3c964o,kgcubera,"Wouldn't obstructing her ability to get back into play be considered obstruction rather than offside?\n\nJust wondering cuz as a goalie, I used to always be irked by the forwards who would try to box me in on a corner."

gifs,3c964o,Raneados,"More like fire that defense. Only 1 goal was conceded because of a mistake made by the goalie. Set-pieces are defendable 99% of the time and we don't even need to talk about goal number 3 I think.\n\nEdit: Well okay, rewatched goal number 5. She should have catched the ball in the first place so yeah, 60% goalie and 40% defense on that goal I think."
gifs,3c964o,Luk0sch,"I cringed at goal number 3. For real, what was she thinking!!"
gifs,3c964o,MrWhite2020,What was who thinking?  The defender who headed it?\n\nShe obviously didn't mean to head it up like that... she just mistimed it...
gifs,3c964o,cv0972,The keeper should have gone for the ball instead of stutter stepping and freezing in place. She would have at least been in the way of the attacker and not let her make such an easy shut.
gifs,3c964o,Chefzor,Hmmmm maybe.... I don't think she would have made it or would have possibly given a penalty away if she had gone for it
gifs,3c964o,cv0972,"Not necessarily, there were two defenders right next to the forward. They could have done something to stop the defender. \n\nUsually the goalie only comes off the line as a last resort. \n\nIn this case, I could see it going either way. It's a lot easier to criticize the decision after having seen it and its outcome but it's a lot harder to make the decision in that split second."
gifs,3c964o,Sack_Of_Motors,Still just major flaws in the defense.  3 crosses across the field that have just blatant lack of defending.  The replays show the whole story: most of the players take a couple steps and plant their feet like the play is dead.  You shouldn't let your goalie be your whole line of defense.\n\nThe ramming header was a bad judgment call.  No clue what she was even thinking.\n\nThe half field kick should have never had a chance.

gifs,3c964o,noodlenova,"There was no guarantee that she was going to beat the last defender, and the JP keeper was so far off her line that a shot from that far out is really tempting. It doesn't always pay off, of course, but if you can catch a keeper off their line, in no man's land (if you'll excuse the term), then you'd be stupid not to at least try when you are yourself so far out from the goal line.\n\nEDIT: Just for emphasis, that keeper was WAY out of position. Shots like these are not commonly taken, let alone scored, because keepers generally know better than to stray that far out when your team isn't attacking with the ball."

gifs,3c964o,dshake10,Nah the keeper was way too far off of her line. Source: she got chipped.
gifs,3c964o,astoswine,That's a super rare shot and usually either isn't made or isn't attempted. She gave herself the best chance to defend the goal and she got scored on. Simple as that.
gifs,3c964o,eaglesquadgaming,No that's not true. She was way out of position considering it was basically a 1v1 away form the US being completely through on goal. If she had gone past the last defender she would be in a very bad position. Looks like she didn't react to a change of possession fast enough and she got punished for it.
gifs,3c964o,dukck,"Right at the beginning of the video the defending is terrible. It was a miracle for the attacking side to pass that defense. Thus, I think the goal keeper's position for the time is fine."

gifs,3c964o,739671619,The reason it's a super rare shot is that the keeper is almost never out of position like that.  Her other goals were better quality than this.
gifs,3c964o,739671619,No that is a very standard position for the keeper to take. One of the best keepers in the world (men) had a similar goal scored against him  this season from about 5-10 yards further away. It allows them to rush forward for a possible interception rather than allowing players to be put straight through
gifs,3c964o,AgroSpragg,I'm assuming you are talking about one of Messi's chips.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Z_pSrCVIHQ\n\nVery rarely are long goalie chips given kudos.  It's not not a hard shot to make.  When it happens it's usually chalked up to the keeper being out of position.  Very short chips are quit different because usually the keeper is the last defend.  In this case she had 3-4 people in front of her.  No reason to be that far out.  Her other goals were better and her header against France was the goal of the tournament IMO.
gifs,3c964o,739671619,Firstly that is the complete opposite of what I'm talking about. This is what I'm talking about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJIvSyrH4Ng\n\nIt is normally said that it is such a good strike as almost all keepers take up that position put it is such a hard shot
gifs,3c964o,Lordelvis97,"""Well off his line""  \n\nHe's referring to the keeper being out of position.  Like I said, it says more about the goalie not knowing his limitations than the brilliance of the strike."
gifs,3c964o,dshake10,"Uh. This got goal of the season, btw. It's absolutely about the brilliance of the strike. As previously stated, keepers will position themselves so as to prevent quick long balls behind the back line when counter attacks happen (aka - when the back line is ""up""). So, ""well off his line"" doesn't mean ""out of position"".\n\nEdit: should've got goal of the season, but Arsenal fans had to ruin everything.

ANY professional football player should be able to make that shot on target from that distance with ease, the reason it's not happening all the time in every game is because of the goalkeeper who will be there and ready for it.

People blaming the keeper are providing the reasoning for their opinion, how about a counter argument that goes beyond ""you know bollocks about football""?\n\nI don't pretend to be a devout fan of the game, but I grew up in a place where you are steeped in the culture of football whether you like it or not and any idiot can tell you that was not a good goal, it was bad goalkeeping."
gifs,3c964o,Iseenoghosts,"From my first comment: ""A goalie is supposed to stand that far from his/her goal in order to get far passes from the other team and to be an active passing point in the game. I suggest you look up Neuer,  by many regarded as the best goalie in the world at the moment. His trademark basically is standing very far in front of his goal and engaging much more than most other goalies.\n\nEdit: Here's a video, skip to 1:40 to see what I'm talking about.""\n\nAside from that, I've been playing football for most of my life and I can tell you that those shots are not easy to make, especially when you're being closely followed by someone from the other team. If she would be a bit taller (like most male goalkeepers) she would definitely have had that shot, also most women can't shoot that far so why should she incorporate the fact that 1 in a 1000 (random number) times someone tries this into her judgement?"

gifs,3c8ald,hamsammicher,"It's guarded.  That red part you see on the outside is just sitting loose over the other shaft.  You could walk up and grab that with your bare hands and you'd be fine.  What's dangerous is the open chain drive, and spokes on the flywheel.  That, and of course, the open area where a ram drives wood into a sharp wedge.  If it'll split that wood so easily, just imagine what it would do to a body."
gifs,3c8ald,PigSlam,"When I run on a treadmill, it's got a motor. I'm not powering anything, Im just along for the ride.  Am I stupid for not understanding this?"
gifs,3c8ald,PursuitOfAutonomy,"A treadmill is a device generally for walking or running while staying in the same place. Treadmills were introduced before the development of powered machines, to harness the power of animals or humans to do work, often a type of mill that was operated by a person or animal treading steps of a treadwheel to grind grain. In later times, treadmills were used as punishment devices for people sentenced to hard labor in prisons. The terms treadmill and treadwheel were used interchangeably for the power and punishment mechanisms."
gifs,3c8ald,jfende,not sure what you don't understand but the main difference here is if the horse stops walking nothing happens. He stands still. Your treadmill on the other hand forces you to maintain a certain speed by moving the treadmill surface.
gifs,3c8ald,jspenguin,"wouldnt the horse need something to pull against, though?  without something to pull/push against and without  a motor, you just walk off the treadmill right?"

gifs,3c7d62,Cynical_Flame,So this explains why that asshole Genghis Khan on CIV V owns the entire map within about 5 turns.
gifs,3c7d62,dreadnough7,"A bit misleading, IMO. It wasn't a single empire with a singlular central government -- more a collection of territories ruled by squabbling cousins. Blood feuds and open warfare amongst themselves weren't exactly rare. \n\nIn the beginning, it was the house of Jochi pitting against Changatai (Genghis' 2 eldest sons). And then it was House of Jochi and Tului (Genghis' youngest of his principal wife) against Guiyuk (son of Genghis' 3rd). When Kublai sent his brother Hulegu to conquer the Mesopotamia, that ultimately caused a rift between house of Jochi and Tului. \n\nWhile it was true that whoever elected Khan was the nominal supreme leader of all Temujinian Hordes. But those elections were rigged and ultimately lost its significance -- the western Khagan didn't even show up for those elections anymore and at best paid lip service to the Supreme Khan if they even recognized his legitimacy."
gifs,3c7d62,the_wakeful,"I could be wrong but I believe this map is of Genghis's empire, before his death. Perhaps including his immediate heir who kept the empire together. It was his grandkids that split everything and fought each other."
gifs,3c7d62,dreadnough7,"Nope. Genghis died in 1227 -- when they've neither sacked Baghdad nor had Northern China under control. And I would argue that Genghis' empire during his lifetime was more like a raiding horde -- they just burned and destroyed whatever they came across. Not until they split up (and again and again and again), the fragments actually established some sort of governmental form over the territory they conquered, vassal states asides."

gifs,3c9dzc,WhatABirch,What causes this?
gifs,3c9dzc,zylli42,There isn't an airtight seal between the revolving chamber and the barrel.  The following image demonstrates it better than I can describe.\n\nhttp://89.145.88.102/~buttere/hbsanorth.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/gas-escape-revolver.png
gifs,3c9dzc,platoprime,The violent explosion of gunpowder propelling a round down the barrel.
gifs,3c9dzc,WhatABirch,Ok so why does it affect something outside of the barrel? Not like someone standing next to a cannon is going to get killed
gifs,3c9dzc,CipherKey,"There is a gap between the cylinder and the barrel.  See link.   Most revolvers will have this gap and your fingers are in the way, they will probably get removed.  There were a couple revolvers where the cylinder would move forward and create a seal mitigating this.  \n\nhttp://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JmVDnWybSTU/UqeJzL7xK8I/AAAAAAAAB08/gYEYbQVcw98/s1600/CylinderGap.jpg\n\nAlso, standing next to a large enough cannon will get you killed from the over pressure.  Red is the death zone from over pressure. \n\nhttp://www.inetres.com/gp/military/cv/weapon/M256/M256_danger.png"
gifs,3c9dzc,FreudJesusGod,"Re: the overpressure, I'm having problems believing ""red"" = death, since the area is 140 metres by 1200 metres. If it was, you could kill an entire army with one shot.\n\nI expect it's actually permanent hearing damage or something."
gifs,3c9dzc,TheMadBlimper,"There's actually a variable to this; if you're standing next to the cannon as it goes off and you're exhaling, you'll probably be fine (minus hearing damage), whereas if you're inhaling that pressure wave can easily rip your lungs apart. This applies to any blast that produces a strong enough pressure wave."
gifs,3c9dzc,platoprime,Well there's a reason no one marches tightly packed groups of soldiers around anymore.
gifs,3c9dzc,R0tareneg,"I think the red zone is more the ""stand here to get decapitated by a sabot petal"" zone:\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/26/Sabot_separating.gif\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0giK-zqrAKI"
gifs,3c9dzc,platoprime,I imagine because the seal between the cylinder and the barrel is imperfect.\n\nAlso standing next to a firing cannon hurts your ears quite a bit.

gifs,3caxon,Just1morefix,The Keys are great. The water is so clear there you will be able to see the looks of terror on your loved ones faces as you are ripped out to sea.
gifs,3caxon,elementsofevan,Well now I'm just excited there will be some lovely visibility for my final dive.
gifs,3caxon,Just1morefix,Dive the Vandenberg if you haven't.  If you're into wrecks it's pretty cool.  One of my favorite dives.
gifs,3caxon,Voondab4,"Im a lake diver so i dont get to see many interesting things like this, need to dive into some seawater sometime"
gifs,3caxon,kungfukicker,I need to know what happened exactly
gifs,3caxon,Atrumentis,It looks to me like a good sized wave. Since a lot of reefs stand out in the water waves move miles through deep ocean and then suddenly hit a reef and are essentially pushed up suddenly and crash when the water is shallow. My guess is that the wave was simply large enough to have a good amount of drag.\n\nEdit: added wording
