Try listening to funk rock to get ideas for the kick and snare, my inspiration is Red Hot Chili Peppers. The fx are usually added in as fillers, kinda like a drummer does a fill every couple bars. But like I said earlier, the song will really drag unless you have the background movement. Listen to some Flux Pavilion and notice how he uses arpeggios to create forward movement."

Hi hats, percussion hits, really quick melodies and drop in and out, these are your key to making a track seem faster and foaming at the mouth with nonstop energy. A kick and snare at 160 bpm with simple 4/4 melody won't seem fast at all! Start utilizing those percussions and drum samples; learn how to make trap snare rolls and start placing offbeat hits etc etc etc ec etc etc :)"
edmproduction,3e3fi8,Cat_Lauer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:33:45 2015 UTC,I think some of the posts here are a little misguided. It's not all in the hats. The drums aren't inherently what fast like people have said but to help I would say focus on the energy and only listen to the drums to start. If you make a drum pattern that makes you energetic and hyped up with just the drums alone then you have a very solid start. This means have them hit hard when you want to and etc. The second is the writing of the melody. I think this is something you really need to be yourself with and will come with practice. You'll make bad melodies but after the bad ones they'll be good ones.

edmproduction,3e3cwt,tadhgerty,4,Tue Jul 21 19:06:03 2015 UTC,"Someone I think who has good intros is Dillon Francis. Check out his tunes for an example/some inspiration.  Think of the intro from a listener's perspective rather than a DJ's. There are lots of pop songs that start with the chorus - these can be successful because there's no waiting to get right to the hook but then it also kinda gives away the surprise right at the start.  I understand if you don't want to make 2 min. intros just for DJs, these are super boring for someone at home. But a short 4, 8, 16 or 32 bar intro is cool for teasing the listener without going 0-100 real quick. Start at 20 and gradually build it up to 100 with vocal chops and bass stabs, teasing at this awesome melody or beat you came up with that's so good it's too much to digest all at once (or try to make it seem that way). Get your listener excited for what's going to come next.  The intro and outro are all about just removing things from the main drop or section and building up/down to keep the energy and flow of the track. Try starting a track from the intro and trying to make one that's really cool and would grab your attention if you found it browsing around Soundcloud. Then take your intro idea and expand to an entire track and see if that helps."

edmproduction,3e27xh,whatiswrongwithmycat,10,Tue Jul 21 11:47:05 2015 UTC,"While making music in most genres entails the actual chordal and melodic content the musician creates, EDM is in a strange space where the very elements of their creation can be made by the musician.   I agree, that it is all about making music, and good music at that, but the fact that you list releasing more tracks and getting more fans before practice contradicts your position.   I don't think good sound design defines what is good music, but I do think it is harder to be good when things don't sound right. In my mind, sound design is everything from making the different sounds you have mesh well to creating the gnarliest bass you can.   I used to strive for that ""most intense"" patch I could conceive, and eventually reached it, and while it benefitted my music it didn't solve every problems.   Now I do a lot of deliberate sound design. The most important thing I achieved by designing that massive, ridiculous patch was I learned how to take what I hear and create it, and while it is often less complicated, just that slight focus on sound design, taking care and putting effort in every sound you use or make, I've made far better music, because everything fits.  I don't think good music is defined by sound design. Plenty of great songs, EDM or otherwise, are mixed shittily, have that slight hum you can't seem to shake, use some nexus preset you've heard in 1,000 other songs, but when I can tell that care was put into each sound, I appreciate it more. It's not objectively better, the lens through which I view it changes, and it becomes a more profound piece of art than something slapped together to draw in more fans."
edmproduction,3e27xh,Acaer,4,Tue Jul 21 13:23:35 2015 UTC,"I think that good engineering highlights a good musical idea. As somebody who does ambient & future garage, a song can really shine when giving a lot of extra care to the reverbs and delays, which play an essential part in the genre. Overall i think it's important but often times very overemphasized, however some genres do require a lot of engineering, such as bass heavy focused music with an emphasis on rhythm and bass design instead of melody."
edmproduction,3e27xh,yubiyoy,3,Tue Jul 21 11:51:50 2015 UTC,"Knowing what your synths and effects are doing is really essential to getting a good clean mix that sounds the way you want it. I like to know what every knob does on every plugin that I use. Not always possible, but it's something that I strive for. You don't want to get in a situation where you can hear something off about your reverb preset but not know how to fix it.   I'm saying people shouldn't hide in the technicalities, pretending the exact specifics of their synthesis is more important than just having a good melody.   In some genres, I think it is way more important to have good engineering (especially the more minimal genres, ambient, techno, electro house, deep house, etc), but in other genres I would say it's much less important (DJ tracks with corny vocal samples and pew pew sounds). On average I would give it equal weight with composition."
edmproduction,3e27xh,mridlen,3,Tue Jul 21 12:08:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly, I think it's important to highlight that the importance of Sound Design varies from genre to genre. For example, in Neuro its super important. Indie Dance, maybe not so much."
edmproduction,3e27xh,SynthHacker,3,Tue Jul 21 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"I think that learning Sound Design as an electronic music producer is what learning an Instrument is to rock/pop musicians.  You don't need to be a great guitarist to write a great rock track, but it sure can set you apart from the rest. The same applies to electronic music producers and sound design."
edmproduction,3e27xh,SynthHacker,4,Tue Jul 21 16:21:10 2015 UTC,"Without sound design we don't have electronic music. If you don't give much attention to your production quality then no one will give much attention to your song.  I'll have to argue that 90% of electronic is in the sound design, arrangement, and mixing. These are all parts of music and especially critical to EDM, so to think of writing as being more important or as a separate entity is the wrong way to go about it. Of course, without song writing there is no music, but most compositions in electronic are not very complex. What is complex is the synth programming (whether or not you made the patch or someone else did), the effects, and the attention to detail to the mix and understanding how to tailor the mix to emphasize the vibe of the song.   If you continue using only presets, your songs will reflect that. If you continue thinking that sound design is a just technicality, then your songs will reflect that. If you want music that people will enjoy listening to, then you're going to need to put a lot more effort into programming and mixing than writing.   Have there been hit songs that had presets in them? Absolutely. Are there electronic artists who have someone else mixing their records? Absolutely. Can you go from an amateur bedroom beat-hero to a professional producer without sound design and professional mixing skills? Absolutely not, unless you're Dutch.   If you are a beginner, then yes, writing is the most important thing to learn and practice. Eventually you'll get to a level where song writing is second nature because you know how to translate what's in your head, or what to add next after you've scribbled some notes down. Now you can focus on making the song unique and professional. Learning how to do that takes exponentially more time than EDM composition. Don't think of it as ""technicalities"", you need to put love into your sound design so that it will sound like you care. Tchami doesn't make beautifully orchestrated dance songs- he makes beautifully designed bass timbres. Most of Portishead's records are very simple, it's Geoff Barrow and Utley's sound design that makes them legendary, etc etc etc. People can focus on what they want to focus on. If you want to put more effort into writing then that is awesome, but I would suggest you find someone who can translate your musical ideas into creative sound design. Example: Chet Faker wrote the songs, Flume designed them."

And the people I've shown have also commented on noticing the difference.  Problem is now I'm stuck, I need to produce more music to master the skills I find really enjoyable and more natural but I struggle with that former portion. So I can understand the wisdom in NOT doing what I have done."

What is complex is the synth programming (whether or not you made the patch or someone else did), the effects, and the attention to detail to the mix and understanding how to tailor the mix to emphasize the vibe of the song.   Sound selection, arrangement, and the ineffable ability to write a ""hook"" and a groove are king if you are going for a hit. Which is to say you're largely right about what's important but that doesn't really make a case against Nexus if it works for the kind of music someone is making. If you can make the music you want to make from presets alone? Go ahead. Same could go for mixing if you were rich enough to hire professionals from the beginning - though at some point you are just hiring a ghostwriter. Which, nobody in EDM would ever do, of course...  Anyway there are artists who make their whole careers on original sound design so it absolutely should not be treated as secondary in electronic music. There are also artists who likely do very little though - all depends on what you're going for."
edmproduction,3e27xh,tugs_cub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:38:24 2015 UTC,"I don't use presets because I don't want to or because I judge the people who do, but because I rarely find ones that I like for a current project and I'm bad at reverse-engineering.  That said, I heavily rely on Nexus for organic sounds."

edmproduction,3e27xh,GabeMiller1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:29:09 2015 UTC,I couldnt do what I wanna do without sound design and sound engineering so this doesnt apply to me. I'm looking to focus on being a neurofunk producer primarly btw. However if you wanna do some stuff with generic sounds then sure go ahead. Still mixdown and mastering is important and presets arent gonna save you there.
edmproduction,3e27xh,Noisetalgia_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"really agree with the last couple sentences from /u/acaer   It's not objectively better, the lens through which I view it changes, and it becomes a more profound piece of art than something slapped together to draw in more fans.   (this isn't directed at anyone specifically, just to be clear)  It's the attention and care put into each track that sells me on an artist, because I as an artist put that much into every single sound in my tracks. ""sound design"" also doesn't have to mean ""complicated"". It requires as much attention to make something powerful and simple as it does to make something complex. Maybe the next guy will make more tracks or whatever but I'll still be here happy because my goal in the first place isn't to make more tracks and get more money it's just to make the BEST music I can, every time. If it takes a month to write a track so be it, I guarantee the experience of the track live will be 1000x better than someone who just used nexus presets to make something musically sound because when you invest the time required to do good sound design for each individual sound, the mood of the track as whole is vastly improved and your work sounds like a much more comprehensive and cohesive expression of yourself/a thought/ an idea.  True artistry in electronic music comes when you can do both things. I think the over-emphasis on writing music and the over-emphasis on getting better at sound design are both absolutely ridiculous. Don't write off one or the other because you aren't very good at it and doing something hard disinterests you because you want instant gratification. A true master can do both things equally well, and isn't that what you should be shooting for? Maybe stop debating over which is better and just write music..."
edmproduction,3e27xh,Killitwithlotsoffire,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:42:06 2015 UTC,"i agree 100%. I see people on the feedback threads always saying stuff like ""good mix bro but i think your snares have too much low end reverb maybe you should turn it down about 4% and add a tiny amount of sidechain compression but not too much just a little, oh and dont forget to boost the mid high range eq's and band pass the low end of the kick but also add delay to your synths but don't forget to turn down the resonance...""  Like wtf? Sure these suggestions will help the mix be a little bit cleaner, but in most cases, especially in the feedback thread, is that the songs lack character and heart.  THAT BEING SAID sound design is also EXTREMELY important, but my point is that electronic music shouldn't and can't rely on just sound design."
edmproduction,3e27xh,TheOneStarfish,0,Tue Jul 21 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the point about sound design being focused on too much over the music itself. I know there was a point in time I was like that and not only did I spend much more time than I needed to on tracks, but the music itself could've been improved on quite a bit.   Just because you have a cool sound for a lead or bass or something in your track doesn't mean it's good musically. If you have a good melody/progression/structure to begin with, you could then apply it a number of different sounds (say you wanted to make a melodic trance-y sounding track but then you wanted to make an alternate piano version or something like that). That could apply to any style of music I feel.  Sound design I feel though is important for the one making the music (especially electronic artists), so that they can get their idea across the way they intend it to be, and not just simply using presets as is. Even just a little tweak on a sound could make a huge difference to what the artist wants to convey to the listener. Combine good music structure/elements and good sound design together and I feel you have a great song in the end."
edmproduction,3e27xh,fmj_music,0,Tue Jul 21 21:40:53 2015 UTC,"Depends of the music you make.... some genres like drone, techno or dub are really technical... With less focus on melody or arrangement.  On the other hand you can make hip-hop or easy-listening on a keyboard workstation and some generic drum samples... But you need a solid melodic foundation."
edmproduction,3e27xh,Jaalmakadamia,0,Tue Jul 21 12:16:24 2015 UTC,"If you're good at it, you gain more control and another layer of creativity. Personally, I use a lot of presets because it doesn't interrupt my workflow. The fix would be to make time specifically for sound design but I don't like sound design as much as I like writing and arranging, etc. I always fine tune my presets though. Anyway, I look at it like this: composers of classical music have set instruments they use and it hardly limits their creativity. Not many composers invented a new violin to get that specific sound they had in their head. Also, I recall hearing a lot of semi-popular samples in Shpongle after I had assumed they recorded everything themselves."

Could be a clap every two bars, I hi hat roll every 4 and a crash every 8. Or it could just be slightly different sounding hat or snare at those intervals. This adds interest and breaks the monotony of the best but doesn't mess with the kick and timing  The way your kick interacts with the bass is pretty important for the groove as well. Mixing up on beat with off beat bass notes is fun. And the same 2/4/8 rule works there too."

edmproduction,3e32zn,Fallencrazy,3,Tue Jul 21 22:08:15 2015 UTC,"My first go-to for smooth transitions is to do a reverse reverb fade in. This involves reversing the vocal, adding a long-tail reverb onto that, rendering it out so that there is a reverb tail coming off the end of that which is actually the beginning of the vocal, then you grab that tail and reverse it, and then slap that reversed tail in front of the vocal. I hope that explanation makes sense. If not, a quick google search of ""reverse reverb"" should do the trick. If the reverb trick doesn't sound right, I will try out the same technique but with different effects like ping pong delay, filter delay.... Hope this helps!"

There are some Windows only freeware VSTs but nearly all commercial plugins will have an OS X version.  Best among MacBooks is obviously highest specs, highest resolution, and maximum portability. There isn't a macbook that currently has all of that, so you need to make a compromise. They're all good (except for the Macbook and baseline Macbook Airs, I would say those are too under-powered for large projects).  Do you want ultimate portability, i.e. a customized 11"" Macbook Air with and i7 an 8GB RAM or ultimate power, i.e. 15"" Macbook Pro with a quad core i7 and 16GB of RAM? Or something in the middle, like the MBPr or a customized 13"" MBA? You have to decide what your priorities are."
edmproduction,3e3qm5,tadhgerty,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:08:10 2015 UTC,"Good answer but I just want to note on the topic of portability - I can't think of a lot of (logical) places that you could fit a Macbook Air and not a Macbook Pro. Don't get me wrong the Air is super light, super thin, 2 inches smaller and objectively IS the more portable of the two, but I think it would be silly to sacrifice power for that. I have a 13"" rMBP and for all intents and purposes it's really light and thin. I have never found myself thinking it's too big and wishing I had a MBAir, even when I'm trying to squeeze it into a tight backpack.  One word of advice though, save up and splurge for max specs. I went for the lowest end model rMPB and I wish I had more storage and RAM. Extra storage will give you more room to partition your hard drive if you want to install Windows (for FL Studio). And RAM you really can't have enough of, it'll help your computer run smoothly when you have a lot of apps/windows/tabs open.  Bottom line, go to an Apple store and play around with all of them. And if you're a student you can get $100 off. In my experience they barely check to verify it, I showed my years old student ID and said I was a current student (didn't have a date on it) and they gave me the discount. Might depend on the store/employee though."
edmproduction,3e3qm5,BigTimpin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:33:32 2015 UTC,"For sure. I myself have the 11"" air which I love and is awesome but bouncing and freezing is unavoidable (at least Logic makes it fairly painless compared to some other DAWs). In terms of portability, if you commute or DJ a lot, there's a lot of places where it could be a lot more convenient than say a 15"" MBP - on a bus, a plane, crowded DJ booth, etc. It feels like it's not even there in a backpack. But going up 2"" is far from a big compromise and would probably be luxuriously light and portable compared to whatever PC laptop OP was using before.  With CPU + RAM upgrades, the 11"" actually very similar in power to the base 13"" MBPr (or at least when I bought last year, the CPUs had benchmarks of 4146 and 4294 with Passmark, and anything less than a 10% difference is unnoticeable to a user).   But if I could have afforded a 15"" with a quad core i7 at the time I without a doubt would have went with that instead. Without a budget there's no way to definitively steer OP.  Edit: yes definitely go to the store and see it in person! I was convinced I wanted to buy the 11"", saw how small it was and was on the fence for a few days then decided it was right for me.

edmproduction,3e3qm5,illojii,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:06:18 2015 UTC,"Do not listen to the guy who said any Macbook Pro will do you just fine. They will not.   I recently upgraded from a mid 2009 Macbook Pro (upgraded to 8 GB) of ram to a late 2013 21.5 inch iMac. It's not portable, but trust me dude it is SO worth it.   I got mine upgraded quite a bit, 16 GB of RAM and a 1 TB Fusion Drive, 2.9 Intel Core i5 processor and the 1 step up graphics card.  The difference between this new computer and my old computer are INSANE. I can work SO MUCH FASTER on this new machine because I don't have to wait. Even with a really expensive Apple computer (short of Mac Pro territory), you're still gonna have to do freezing and bouncing to audio if your sessions get big. The big difference is there's a lot less latency and freezes/bounces happen a lot faster. Synths and ROMplers and sample libraries load SO fast (thanks to the Fusion Drive, would be even faster with the SSD I bet).  All told my new iMac cost me $2,100 and after seeing the difference in speed and efficiency and the big beautiful screen and everything it was more than worth every penny. I fucking love this machine, PC shitlords can fuck off with their master race bullshit. New iMacs, when beefed up, are fucking awesome.   If you can afford it I'd first recommend a Mac Pro, but those are crazy expensive so try for an iMac with upgraded RAM and an SSD or a Fusion Drive if you can afford it.   The new MacBook's are just not powerful enough for how much they cost. I wanted to get a new Macbook when I was looking to upgrade and decided against it because I felt you just don't get enough power for how much money you're paying. And yeah, you get portability but I'd much rather have more power and have to deal with the hassle than have to wait that much longer for another fucking ""Freezing..."" progress bar.   But that's just me. I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about it, good luck, and DON'T buy something just because its shiny and new! Check the specs!   Ideally you want a computer with 8 to 16 GB of RAM and a good processor, quad-core is ideal for affordable modern computers."

It's all about what makes you smile at the end of day.   i hate when someone just says ""its all in the mixing"", but the ultimate truth is, its all in the mixing"

There's no need to rush material that sound worse than what you would consider your standard, especially if it's just for the sake of getting them out to the public. Again, I may be assuming a bit here, but I've been in a similar situation before and was unhappy with the finished product.

If you have some good, flat heaphones (or if you have basshead headphones and know them very well I guess it's fine) you can make it sound good.  What I do is that I actually don't really do a master. I put a G-Clip at 99% to control my peaks and maybe an EQ but that's it. I make the mix as loud as I can. I make it sound good. I do my best to make it as I imagine it, as loud as I can. And really I think personally it's better like that. I mean, you can't change the taste or the quality of your cake once it's ready to put in the oven lol. You do that when you are mixing your stuff (upvote for best analogy of 2015 awards)  When it clips, you actually have the control on your mix. So remove some frequencies on one instruments, sidechain something. You have total control. You always have total control when mixing. I think that for some EDM sub genres, the mastering is useless. When one of the important aspect of the music is to make it loud, why wait for the mastering?  Seamless did many videos about this idea too."

Both have these features: 4 decks looping and cue buttons (S4 has 8, NV has 10) plus a million others that are standard with most controllers but those are two important ones  The NV runs Serato and the S4 uses Traktor. each person has a preference but I like Traktor because it was designed specifically for the S2, S4 and now the S8. if you play on moving to vinyl Serato is by far the better option.  You do get the screens on the NV so you aren't staring at your computer and it does feel more like a CDJ which would be handy if you plan on transitioning to that.  I have the S2 and S4 and I wouldn't switch to anything else. I find its a solid device and solid software (for the most part).

edmproduction,3e0xs7,quistgard,4,Tue Jul 21 02:49:10 2015 UTC,"The mixed track should sound as close as possible to the final master, just quieter. Most pro tracks you hear would likely sound almost identical post-mix vs post-master.  I understand you want to know what's possible to achieve in a mix as well. My tip would be that if a sound isn't sounding good, don't expect to be able to fix it in the mixing stage. Most of us have spent far too many hours trying to make shit sounds fit in the mix nicely. It's best to aim for the best sounds you can right from the start. You will then EQ them, compress, add effects/whatever to have it sit properly in the mix, but the sound itself should sound nice before you even start down that road."

There are loads of resources that will teach you how to master, there aren't that many that teach practical mixing technique.

Like, go crazy with it, pan things hard left/right. Everything except your kick, snare/claps, sub, and bass should be panned as far as they can go without sounding ""off"". It'll immediately make your mixes wider and clear up space in your mix."
edmproduction,3e0xs7,Robototron_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:16 2015 UTC,"The human ear doesn't hear lower sounds as ""panned"" as well as it does higher sounds, so panning the kick and bass sounds doesn't make sense or work in practice.  I've seen some people pan their percussion (hihat, snares, cymbals) a little bit, not by much, to replicate a drumset feel, but I don't know that I'd call it effective.  If you have a plugin that'll affect stereo width as well as placement, that'll make a big difference, too. Try applying chorus to a center-panned lead with different settings in the left and right channels, and you could get some neat effects, though it may sound lopsided."

edmproduction,3dzcmg,triphosphate77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:37:24 2015 UTC,"yeah, found this table also, but im thinking, is there a point in setting the release according to this table/to the tempo, if the beat is not ""four-to-the-floor"", but something more complex?"
edmproduction,3dzcmg,N4N4KI,2,Mon Jul 20 20:42:02 2015 UTC,I'm just wondering how complex you'd need to get before a period of 8th or a 16th would sound out of place.   I mean if you are working in triplets work out the timing for those and use them instead.
edmproduction,3dzcmg,triphosphate77,2,Mon Jul 20 21:31:09 2015 UTC,"Well, you mention that when you apply a compressor with too long a release that it's obvious to you, but that when the release is short (<150ms) that you can barely tell the difference... have you tried maybe making your ratio more extreme? so that even when your release is short you can hear it?   The way I usually set up a compressor is I max out my ratio, and set the threshold to the sweet spot, then dial in my release and then go back and turn your ratio to something more reasonable."
edmproduction,3dzcmg,triphosphate77,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:09:28 2015 UTC,"Just a thought, since I've never actually tried this myself.  But if your issue is that a release time of <150 ms is too fast for your ears to perceive, have you tried maybe setting a short release and bouncing out a couple measures of your song, and then time stretching that sample so that you can more clearly hear the release time in context with your beat?"
edmproduction,3dzcmg,oofam,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:26:43 2015 UTC,"Well I wouldn't just set the release straight to the value in the table, but rather use it to get in the ballpark and then adjust it to what sounds best to you. Even with complex drum beats and such, your compressor is really going to be triggered by the most prominent transients e.g. Kick drum and snare (most likely) and the overall time signature of your beat is still going to fit in 4/4 or whatever. Use the value for 1/8th or 1/16th to glue everything around the pulse of your song and accentuate the groove"
edmproduction,3dzcmg,BilgeXA,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:59:21 2015 UTC,Use your ears.
edmproduction,3dzcmg,fmj_music,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:13 2015 UTC,"Setting the release time for compression, whether on a master/bus or just a single channel, is mainly something done by ear. You basically just got to play around with the time until you feel you achieved a preferred level of rounding out the balance (unless you're leaning towards wanting some added crispness or a bit of a pumping effect, but that doesn't seem to be the case here). Try starting at 100ms or something close and pull it back/push it forward til you like what it is doing.  Not sure if this would be helpful but you could also try mixing between the compressed signal and the uncompressed signal with the wet/dry knob, that can help you achieve a leveled out signal while keeping some of the original sound and transients intact."
edmproduction,3dzcmg,stereo16,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:01:02 2015 UTC,Well I don't know about the other part but if you set your release time to really low levels you get waveshaping distortion.
edmproduction,3dzcmg,sezdaniel,2,Mon Jul 20 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"Use your ears. Turn up the compression if you have to until its very dramatic. Calculating a number for the release time isn't going to make it right, because it has nothing to do with the sound falling below the compression threshold... You're just setting a release time without considering when that release is beginning."
edmproduction,3dzcmg,mosaic_,3,Mon Jul 20 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"Waaait... aren't most compressor release curves exponentially shaped? I mean, usually it's not like a straight line that just sweeps back up immediately, right? Usually release times express how long it takes for an envelope to fall to some percent of its maximum. Also, the length of time that the signal is above the threshold would also influence the length of the gain reduction, right?  I mean, unless you're using an LFO solution for compressing, I would think that this sort of thing would have to be done by ear. I see what you mean about fitting it into the groove - that's what I try to do - but I'm not sure if it's just so simple as choosing a certain release time. Correct me if I'm wrong; I'd like to know too."

The thing is if you only used a few notes there is a chance that you could be writing in a variety of different keys, which is why if you take your most stable note you can get an idea and look up the full scale online.   From a musical perspective you can basically follow the notes with the same in the bass. IF you played chords you are safe to play any of the notes in that chord also in the bass to accompany.

edmproduction,3e0zel,henriquebraun,4,Tue Jul 21 03:02:35 2015 UTC,"For most of the last 11 years I've worked in various video game development studios as a game design lead. In that environment I've had to work really closely with all the different disciplines in the studio. I learned a really important tip from observing all the visual artists I worked with, which I've been able to apply successfully to music production.  WORK FROM REFERENCE MATERIAL ALWAYS.  I'm not a visual artist at all, and before working in games I always thought what separated artists from non-artists was that the former had this magical ability to create beautiful art out of nothing but their imagination. Imagine my surprise when, upon observing artists in the workplace, I saw that all of them worked from visual reference, on every task, every day, all of the time. Sometimes they worked from photographs, or screenshots from other games, or other artists' images (often from non-game artists), but I never in my eleven years in that industry saw an artist doing production work without some visual reference on their screen at all times.  I often struggle to write music that fits a particular style; I tend to fall back to my musical comfort zone (melodic trance) way too easily, which is obnoxious when I'm actually trying to write breaks, or film score, or whatever. So lately I've taken a cue from those visual artists and started working from musical reference as an active part of my workflow.  A simple example: earlier today I was working on a breaks track and it just wasn't gelling, and I couldn't put my finger on why. But I'd picked out a specific reference track to work from, so I played it back and compared it to my WIP. The reference track had a pretty prominent pad gluing everything together; I had no pad. So I went a found a patch with a similar timbre to the one in the reference, and almost immediately the creative logjam started to break. I ended up editing it away from the reference and into something quite different by the end, but without working directly from a reference I probably would've banged my head against that problem for hours and then quit in frustration."
edmproduction,3e0zel,invicticide,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:31:03 2015 UTC,"Nice insight! Many times I find myself trying to be the Da Vinci of dance music and create completely new material... As someone once said ""good artists copy, great artists steal"" or Isaac Newton's ""If i have seen further than others, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.""  Perhaps it could be a nice idea to hear more tracks of different genres and bring that specifics into my music...  It's true that in some way everything we do musically is based on references and copies, anyway everything is just musical frequencies combined in different ways. So the creative force is in fact the capacity of organizing some material is some new way. So even though we can mirror our work with others, I wonder how to to know if I should write A B C instead of B C A. Or how to know if I the combination of flowers and sun will sound better than the combination of flowers and moon, if you know what I mean.  The instrumental for Calvin Harris's tracks for example are composed in a very original way. Even though he normally uses the same arrangement the type of instruments and the combination of things he makes is his own.   So I'm trying to, well, take reference in all the guys that I appreciate, and yet make my own stuff. I've been referencing a lot, but what I'm struggling is exactly this part of making something slightly original, and that sounds adult and professional.  Cheers, bro!"
edmproduction,3e0zel,djastrofunk,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:15:40 2015 UTC,"This is a very depthful topic, but I would say I take a very throwing paint at a wall approach. I generally start just messing around with synthesizers until I get a sound I am super into, and from there I just begin building around it. Just trying out random things and seeing what happens. I do hear music in my head a lot, but I do not generally write from what I am hearing in my head. Like I said I throw paint at well (Figuratively speaking).   As far as having the song progress and getting out a loop. That is one of my biggest struggles. But some tips I picked up along the way (and I found it helps) is taking the loop and just copy it across the arrangement and then just begin subtracting things out and creating an actual arragment. This will not be your final arrangement but It will give you a better feel on how you want the track to progress.  I hope this helps a little I kind of went all over the place with my thoughts, but again my process is kind of all over. It almost just looks like chaos to an outside perspective but its actually very methodical in a weird way to me.

edmproduction,3dzse4,gregmarkov,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:36:44 2015 UTC,"Okay, so compression is only going to compress your peaks. Hard knees will compress your peaks, and soft knees are going to compress your RMS values before peaks depending on how soft (generally speaking). Upward compression is a thing, but personally I don't know how it works, so fuck that.  What I would do is have multiple compressors working in series. What I do is just take the stock compressor, set a 5ms attack, 50-100ms release, 3:1 ratio, 2-4 dB reduction, soft knee. And right after that, I add another one with a fast attack, fast release, 3:1 ratio, and another 2-4 dB compression. If you want more of the lower dynamics, just adjust the threshold to get more gain reduction on both compressors.  *The end result will sound a lot better if you time your attack and release times to the song"

You can replicate similar effect on any synth that let's you put a gain larger than 1 on the oscillators, before the filter.  Or you also have a drive parameter in some filters that does the same thing.  You don't need a special automation to do it, the amount of distorsion will vary by itself according to the volume of the oscillator.... so just use the standard VCA controls.

The oscillators are modulated by a VCA and then are sent through a filter. If the VCA amplifies the signal of the oscillators too much, the amplitude of the signal will be too high when it enters the filter and this will cause distorsion.... Or clipping, depending of how your synth is designed."

For me, twitch.tv's music channel has been a huge game-changer. Producers of ALL levels will just sit and stream for hours. There's something valuable to glean from any one of them. Often, you will find someone around your experience level and when you're feeling completely un-inspired and awful about producing, watching someone working live is almost always instantly inspiring. Even if just ""hey, look at this guy, he's making it happen"" or ""he's just been sound-designing in Sytrus for 30 minutes and it's awesome"".   For starters, go to Twitch and look up a guy named James Egbert. He has his old broadcasts (3-7 hours in length each) archived on his channel and it is great to just watch and absorb. Of course, many, many other excellent producers are on there and do the same :) My 2 cents FWIW"

One thing you could try is playing with vocals  , download a bunch of random acapellas from the web , try chopping them and come up with a melody , and a supporting chord and drum and stuff , When dons , Loose the vocals or dont if you like them ,   This really helped me .

Trying to sit down and write music everyday can be very stressful if you are being increasingly disappointed by the music you are writing. It’s good to not worry about producing music for a couple of days or weeks, and instead of producing on the days that you usually would, you can spend that time watching tutorials, reading manuals, making synth patches, practice your mixing and mastering on some of your older tracks, and so on… The list is endless.  It’s also good to find out what does inspire you and will get you back on track.

edmproduction,3dv9x8,FlippinPigeon,4,Sun Jul 19 20:30:34 2015 UTC,Hey there! What could be the 'problem' is that your attack is too slow to catch the transient of your audio signal. What I mean with this is that I can see that your compressor is set at an attack 2ms which is pretty fast. However sometimes sharp transients can go through the compressor uncompressed. What happens when the compressor applies makeup gain it is essentially boosting the transient and compressing the rest of the signal.

So at a -4db signal, it's really up to the internals of the compressor implementation to decide what ratio is going to get applied based on the knee. Best to turn off the knee if your going to do this kind of detailed measurement, unless you are trying to also measure the knee..."

edmproduction,3dwpj9,Pirlomaster,5,Mon Jul 20 04:06:13 2015 UTC,Seems like you're getting some phase cancellation when you don't cut out the lows and that's why you're getting lower sound levels.
edmproduction,3dwpj9,iamonapig,3,Mon Jul 20 04:15:29 2015 UTC,"PEQ2 is a Minimum Phase equalizer, as are most other equalizers. This means that when a filter is applied, the phase of the audio source is also shifted. This phase shift can result in a loss or gain of headroom.  If you want your headroom to be maintained you need to use a Linear Phase EQ. In FL there's one in Convolver (look in the presets), but I'd recommend you look at something like Fabfilter's Pro-Q 2, just for ease-of-use.  The thing is though, for the most part there's no need for LP EQs, as they add unnecessary latency and pre-ringing of transients which you may not want to deal with. The general consensus is that you stick with MP EQs, unless you absolutely need to maintain headroom/phase (eg. in mastering).  :)"
edmproduction,3dwpj9,coranns,2,Mon Jul 20 04:23:40 2015 UTC,"Actually just spoke with my friend about this. If you think about it simply: imagine your sound as being placed in a box (covering all frequencies). when you cut part of those frequencies, you make more room in the box for the other freqs. That opens up some room for those higher frequencies in the box, thus their volume goes up. Make sense?"

A lot of producers don't have the skills that mastering takes – or they don't have the interest/time/resources to learn it, which is fine, and in that case it's better to leave it for a professional.   Some (e.g., DJ Teebee) does it all himself, doing a great job. I do it myself, too.   But it takes time and effort to learn it, and it's definitely WAY more than just pushing it the premaster to a mastering limiter. Sometimes it's just a little more than that, but often times it's way more than that (at least with the mixes I receive from my clients).  I hear ""you can do it all yourself"" thrown around today with Ozone etc being so popular, but it might be a good idea to master your song as well as you can and then have it mastered by a pro and compare it, because only then you may hear what your master is lacking."

Then there is a lot of artists saying they do it all, like Laidback Luke, Martin Garrix, Skrillex, Madeon, deadmau5 and so forth. A lot of them say they tried another engineer a few times because the label convinced them to and they didn't like it as much as the product they were getting. Several professionals have said in interviews that it's overrated and more or less a loudness boost. In addition, maybe they will for one track and won't for another they need some help with.   In a lot of Internet forums the consensus seems to be all the pros send it to their label's in house engineer to run it through the same master chain every time, but most of the interviews and in the studio videos I've watched from artists indicate that a lot of them do it themselves, or claim to, which is worth more to me than unsubstantiated forum speculation."

Too much of its benefits get attributed to voodoo and expensive vintage gear though. I especially dislike the ""if you have to ask why then just get a mastering engineer and stop asking questions"" attitude that perpetuates around the internet/audio circles. Duh expensive gear is going to sound great and someone who's done it for 10 years knows more and is better than you at doing it. If you can get your track to sound like the Beatport top 10 and bang in a club with some plugins on your master out while you're produce the entire track though, then who cares? You gotta practice and study a lot, but it's not rocket surgery.

edmproduction,3dtyyx,Fallencrazy,2,Sun Jul 19 19:24:14 2015 UTC,"Usually the 300hz area gets a little congested which doesn't sound all that pleasant. Would I rather EQ 80 tracks or do all of them at once? Now this is minimal processing, like 0.5-1 dB on a linear phase EQ. More than that and I'd rather do it on instruments individually.  Also, when I'm mixing (and for a lot of people) you tend to focus on the midrange, stuff like a piano, guitar or vocals that provides the melodic content of the song. So when you're done getting everything balanced, it can sound pleasing to just bump up the bass and the high end a little bit with EQ and/or multi-band compression.  Some very subtle saturation can sound cool, and super light compression on the peaks can fatten the whole mix up a bit. Professional producers like Oliver Heldens and Deorro say they don't do any mastering and would probably just do stuff all this in the mix, but I find it convenient for tightening it all up in one fell swoop on top of that.  Also, I could mono each instrument individually below 150Hz to tighten the low end up, but I just do it on the master and it works for me. Same goes for boosting the sides a bit.  Edit: should be mentioned that I mix as I go and recently turn on the master chain quite early, sort of when I get most of the arrangement sorted out. So it's sort of an extension of mixing for me anyway just to get it more clean, loud and punchy., and I can bounce out preview versions to listen to and critique without them sounding drastically quiet or wimpy in a DJ set."

A great mix doesn't need much, as the engineer has already put everything where it needs to be. No matter how good the mastering engineer, if the mix is fucked, the master will be fucked too.  Mastering is really just paring away extraneous data so that it sounds great on all speakers, and then boosting it so that the RMS brings the track focus to the front of the mix, even when gained very low on consumer speakers."
edmproduction,3dtyyx,BassBeerNBabes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:33:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with the first half of your statement, the second half not so much.  Mastering isn't for mix translation. It's called ""Mix"" translation for a reason. That is done in the mixing stage. If you have everything mixed well it will translate on all speakers perfectly. If your mid range sounds good but sound muddy on an home speaker, you eq some synths or clear up some mud. You wouldn't cut the midrange on the master. But, mastering can help this a little tiny bit.  Also, boosting RMS doesn't really change which elements are in the front. That's also in the mixing stage I believe?  Mastering is literally Glue, Harshness fixes (usually using automation), and limiting. You shouldn't pay unless you gain something from the expensive hardware that professional engineers have. It's like renting out 20,000 studio equipment, but paying someone else to use it as well.   You don't pay for the mastering engineer to really master as much as you're paying him to use his studer tape mastering recorder, 5,000$ reference system, shadow hills compressor, and manley passive  EDIT: maybe you're right on the translation.. But not in the mastering phase. I actually know a lot of engineers who tell the client any problems with the mix translation wise and allow them to send it back in. So I guess you're testing it on various speakers, just not fixing it with the engineer's mastering."
edmproduction,3dtyyx,EzShmeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:15:55 2015 UTC,"Everything I've learned in my studies indicates that the entire purpose of mastering is making it cleaner on consumer equipment, hence the subtractive cleanup and limiting. The reasoning being that the speakers have a set frequency response curve and dynamic response. This pushes the important information to the front in a way that any set of speakers can reproduce.  edit: It helps for the mix to be good, as I said, if it's fucked, it won't master well in the first place. Getting it back in the mix stage helps pare out the trouble harmonics and boost the weak ones. But the mastering is the golden ticket to an album that translates well."
edmproduction,3dtyyx,BassBeerNBabes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:46:12 2015 UTC,Well you want a good pair of monitors to mix on. The speakers you're referring to are often called grot box speakers. I would never master on them solo.   Maybe im misunderstanding you. When you master there are some small eq and stereo image processing you can use. But if you turn on a grot box to check translation in the mastering phase and your mid range is cluttered and your main synth doesn't cut through. You're kind of fucked. You can't clean it or bring it to the focus. I mean you can but I would really really advise just goin back to the mix.
edmproduction,3dtyyx,EzShmeezy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:21:11 2015 UTC,"Yes, grot boxes are part of what I'm talking about. The best mastering studios have combinations of farfield monitors, nearfield monitors, grot boxes, consumer HiFi, and earbuds/phones for translation, at least from my understanding. Mastering should only take a couple hours per song. The entire point being, certain speakers have particular frequency ranges that speak better.  The mix should be nearly perfect. A mix should hypothetically be standalone without mastering. The mastering comes in and takes the tracks to that next level by checking the monitor on other speaker types. It shouldn't need much work if the mix engineer did his job right.  The masters are EQ'd, phase aligned, and limited to focus the dynamics. The last stage in mastering is adding the track info and then ordering the tracks to be either burned to hard master, or ISO'd or zip'd to be sent to a distributor. In vinyl pressing, the mastering also guarantees the ridges don't kick the needle off the record by limiting bass and dynamic response."
edmproduction,3dtyyx,BassBeerNBabes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:14:04 2015 UTC,"It depends on your definition of ""pro"" in this context. A lot of ""pros"" master their own work -- and it sucks ass.  A lot of other ""pros"" master their work and it comes out clean.  The industry opinion is to let others master your mixes. As a result, the masters are done by a 3rd party, and often sound better. This isn't 100% necessary, but in general the work of a another set of ears just usually comes out better. It also comes down to personal preference."

edmproduction,3duaym,JulianOsorio,2,Sun Jul 19 15:26:39 2015 UTC,This may be odd advice but step up your understanding  of rhythm. Practice your chord prog on a midi keyboard just doing these chords for a bar long then turn on the drums and start grooving whith the rhythm. You need to be comfy with the rhythmic motif as well as the playing the chords before you can start jamming.

After that they just cut up parts to create more interesting rhythms.   If its creating more interesting chords you're having problems with, music theory is your friend. Get piano lessons, or teach yourself to play and this will help you to create more interesting chords.

edmproduction,3duaym,statmarker,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:36:59 2015 UTC,"I definitely have more issues with rhythm than constructing them when it comes to chords. Usually I just leave it as I described in my original post, or make it into eighth notes.   But often times when I watch tutorials, I watch the person write their chord progression (It's recorded so I can't see the MIDI so idk what chords) and the notes are too spaced out to be triads. I'm thinking it might be power chords?"
edmproduction,3duaym,Mikep98,4,Sun Jul 19 15:45:31 2015 UTC,"the notes are too spaced out to be triads.    Inversions, polychords, 7ths, 9ths, 13ths, layering octaves underneath the chord... Nobody really does straight triads. I would say as a general rule of thumb it's best to avoid straight 3-note triads as it will sound both extremely boring and amateur at best. Start messing around with different inversions, then start adding octaves underneath the triads. Pay attention to how much the lowest, middle, and highest notes move between chords, how they move in relation to the bass notes etc etc."

edmproduction,3duaym,joeydendron,4,Sun Jul 19 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"A good way to spread out chords is to move the third up an octave, and sometimes add another root an octave down. So for a C minor chord, you might have:  C3 E3 G3  but to make it sound much bigger, try something like:  C2 C3 G3 E4."

Also learn about making chords go together by family. ie Am-Dm7-FMaj7-C. Certain notes of each chord can run together and fit like a puzzle, with some ""edges"" (notes) poking from one chord into the other. Create melodies before chords, then fit chords to that. Use beat 4 as the leading tone/leading chord's space to shine. Think Dm-F-Am-C-G7 (beat 4)."
edmproduction,3duaym,Lizard771,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:18:30 2015 UTC,"Rhythm is always going to be more important than your actual progression. Look at how many pop songs use the exact same chord progressions, but sound totally different.  Personally, I learned a lot about writing fun rhythms from early 90s rave music, such as from this website (which helpfully also gives you MIDI files):  https://oldskoolpianos.wordpress.com/  Even if you don't like the music, download the MIDI files, load them into your DAW, and take a look at what's going on rhythmically. In fact I'd say just download MIDI files from pop songs as well, so you can start to visualize what other artists are doing (if you don't like playing music yourself this is really the only way you're going to get better,  by seeing how music is played on the piano roll). Go on Youtube and look up Synthesia piano tutorials for artists you like, most big name artists will have a tutorial posted by someone on piano roll, it's super helpful."

edmproduction,3duaym,Fallencrazy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:13:55 2015 UTC,"I like to variate the chords, so there is as little difference between each note. For example, if I'm going from a C major chord to an E minor chord, play an Em/B instead, so you are only moving one note. You can play around with which variations sound the best, but I do this a lot because on many synths, if there is two much distance between the notes of the chords it sounds a little out of place. It really depends on the style of the song, but sometimes you can add a minor 7th, major 7th, 9th, 12th, etc. to some of the chords to make it sound more interesting. I saw an iOS app that helps construct chord progressions. I don't have an Apple device, so I haven't been able to try it, but based on reviews it looks pretty useful ( https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/suggester-chord-progression/id504740787 ). You can also add a rhythm to how the chords are played. So instead of just holding them out for a measure, you could play it on 2 or 3 different beats in the measure.  And lastly, change the progression throughout the song just a little bit. Like, for a couple sections of the song, switch out a chord or two  for another so the song moves a little more and is more interesting/less repetitive."

Brostep fuses electro house, complextro, dubstep and reggae riddims into an ADHD aggressive cheesy genre that bears actually little resemblance to dubstep sans some rhythmic patterns. The sound world is much closer to electro house and the changing sounds comes from complextro where you need at least 4 or more different synths changing between those to build your main parts.   Whereas in dubstep you will hear way less distortion. It might have similar wobbling sounds, but how they're used will be very different. Here is a great example of what dubstep can sound like. You'll see that the main parts of the song revolve around a low wobbly sub bass with maybe some organs and smaller percussive sounds, but everything revolves mainly around one or two sounds for the majority of the whole song."

As long as you're not rendering/bouncing anything that clips, there's no problem from a technical point of view.  By the way, when you're bringing things down to avoid clipping, keep in mind that some plugins can cause clipping from high levels, so remember to watch out for that too. For example, sometimes you may need to turn down a synth's output instead of changing your DAW's fader level, if the synth's being fed into a plugin that clips like that."

I wouldn't say there's really a wrong way to go about this sort of thing, as long as you get a decent end result, but what you could do also is turn your volume up on your speakers and keep the levels in the DAW pretty low.

Keep an eye on clippings inside your fx chain, it will affect your sound before the track volume control even if you keep it low there.

You can crank up the gain at the end on the master fader.  What's bad about redlining is not just each channel clipping but rather the fact it is going into each insert above 0db. From what I understand this is handled differently (and sometimes grossly) by different plugins and to maintain a clean, consistent sound you want to keep your levels low until the master fader.

I don't know why you spend money on a physical one instead of a plugin though.   If you're only doing EDM, Ableton Live is all you need in terms of a DAW. I have a 2015 MacBook Pro w/Ableton Suite 9 and it has served me well. I have a high-end Windows workstation as well but the audio drivers have always given me issues and Windows is just not as stable, secure or good at handling audio as OS X is.   Something like this will be good for producing on. One thing you'll notice is lower latency when using a dedicated audio interface. You'll also be able to record MIDI from your synthesizer if it uses a 5-Pin MIDI output although from what I've seen they are now starting to use MIDI over USB. Feel free to PM me if I've lost you."

edmproduction,3dsiqx,KlLLADELPHIA,-1,Sun Jul 19 02:30:30 2015 UTC,You need an AI no matter what. The back of Focusrite and Presonus and most AI's have MIDI input and output like this which means you can plug your synthesizer straight into the interface meaning you can record notes played on your synth into your DAW and vice versa.  Here is the side of a Moog Subphatty. You would plug a 5-pin midi cable from your synth into your AI to record the notes. If you don't have an external midi device then you won't use these inputs ever.   I'm recommending you buy an audio interface with maybe 2-4 inputs and then some VST synthesizers. I use an AKAI MPK61 which is great for playing drums/synths because of the key-weighting and velocity curve.  It's also nice because it has knobs which come in handy when you want to automate something in Ableton.   Let me know if that makes sense c:

You can DJ with a controller with audio coming from Ableton but I'm not very experienced in that department.  If your budget limits spending 600-700 dollars on monitors buy some monitoring headphones.  Like these.  Monitor speakers are to be used for production ONLY.  They are near-field speakers which means they do not work very well at long-range distance. If you go to a venue or club you'll see that they have line-array speakers which are far-field (long-throw) speakers. i.e. effective at long range.     Monitor speakers are not powerful enough or effective at long range to be used for performing. I wouldn't recommend moving your monitors from your studio unless you absolutely have to. They're not designed to be dropped/hit/kicked like line-arrays are.

If you want to get serious an Audio Interface will definitely be needed. Not only for a synth but more importantly for studio monitors which are an absolute need as far as production goes. Personally I use the NI Komplete Audio 6. I have a couple synths and Rokkit studio monitors and they work just fine. As far as synths go I'm not sure you really really need a physical one right now. There are plenty of virtual alternatives that work just as well and you could spend that money on a good MIDI keyboard or your studio monitors and audio interface. Finally a word of advice: When you first start off neither your studio speakers, synths or software will get you into making amazing songs.

edmproduction,3drlqr,kakemot,6,Sat Jul 18 19:57:39 2015 UTC,"In my experience things like guitars and pianos often work better as layers than as stars of the track (depends on what you're going for though). If you treat them like another midrange-y synth in the stack and turn it way down, it will probably make mixing easier, or do some fancy sidechaining. I usually like having something like bells or flutes or pianos to fill out my sounds. Physical Modeling synths and sampler patches can be very useful for this.  Having said that, a good example of the guitar being the main layer that you can maybe lift some inspiration from is ""Love Will Never Let You Down"" by Eddie Thoneick. Here he is describing how he recorded the part with a DI.  It sounds like you know how to record guitar well but in case you don't for sure for sure make sure you use a click track and try comping together sections in several takes then perfect it with flex time for that perfectly quantized pop/EDM feel.  A technique you may not have thought of, is record a strum of one note or a few at different octaves and throw that in a sampler, then write the part in MIDI. You can still add slides and velocity but keep it super in time also. Good luck!"
edmproduction,3drlqr,tadhgerty,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"I usually turn my guitars down but there are slight plucking sounds that make it confusing and that way it rarely works in the background, it's like it's too much going on with the guitars and when you turn it down the listener tries to hear what's going on in the background with the finger picking and it's not a good thing. But I guess that's the way I play and I could work on that or get someone to record it, or maybe just do some simple strumming.  I like the midi sampler tip, I really gonna try that one out!"
edmproduction,3drlqr,tadhgerty,6,Sat Jul 18 21:44:04 2015 UTC,"Try compressing, transient shaping or multiband compression/de-essing if you haven't already to dull the transients + high end and reduce the dynamic range, and it should fit at least a bit better and be less ""plucky""/sharp (I think I know what you mean). Heavy processing may seem weird for an acoustic guitar but in a band situation the instruments are selected so as to already give a pleasant separation of frequencies between each instrument; with EDM you have carte blanche almost. As with synth layering though, it should just sound good when you add it, then just a bit better with processing, so make sure there is space for it, the tone is right and you compress it.   Play with the tone of your guitar with different pickups (if you're using an electric) or mic placement and trying EQing and compressing a bit before you actually record it to audio. Filtering and saturation might help too to make it sound more natural and less over-bearing.  Are you layering and playing the exact same melody as the synths it's going with? It could also be an arrangement problem where there's too much anyway that's being compounded by a subpar recording. Maybe have a few sessions where you just record over a kick or something dead simple for a few hours to make sure your playing is super tight as well and you're getting the tone you want. Hope you get it sorted it out!"
edmproduction,3drlqr,duggreen,4,Sat Jul 18 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that if you get a really good player with big chops, there's less to do during mixing. Also, the choice of guitar to record with is huge. For me, it should be a Fender type with low impedence (less than 5k ohms) single coil pups with alnico 5 polepieces. Pickups like that have very wide frequency (and dynamic) response, so the recorded sound responds well to processing and EQ."

It could be just a matter of nudging the entire guitar or whatever live instrument track backward by a few samples. Your DAW ""should"" be doing this automatically, but it may not work out perfectly for various reasons.  If possible, record while live monitoring your instruments, not the post through the DAW. Have a long lead in with a measure of clicks that you play to percussive, after recording zoom in & nudge by hand or tiny increments so those plucks are landing exactly on the steps they should. See if that makes a difference."

edmproduction,3drlqr,PIECOvU,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:51:09 2015 UTC,Here's a couple things that have helped me: Playing guitar over a completely quantized locked in groove will almost always sound weird. Adding natural swing to the rhythm will help.  When I record guitar for electronic music I'll almost always keep it super minimal and either have the guitar center channel or hard left and right without a center if there's more important things going on there.  And the most important thing by far is leaving enough frequencies for the guitar so it doesn't sound too muddy or busy. Mixing while writing is how I keep that in check.  Hope those help any.
edmproduction,3drlqr,DownvoteThisUsername,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:09:33 2015 UTC,"Thank you! I usually cut all the low end and some of the mid range in the guitar, it helps with the muddy sound.

edmproduction,3drlqr,TurtlesOfJustice,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:47:47 2015 UTC,"Hmm, so I struggle when mic'ing my acoustic too for a lot of reasons. Mainly because it picks up everything - hitting the deck, fingers sliding the strings, strumming (hard to be super tight ln each strum), etc. Generally my advice would be that if you mic up your guitar make it the center piece of the tune. And...rest assured...it will take you a few tries to be tight. :)  Also I wouldn't record directly in a project if it reaches a certain size. Bounce it, create a new project, have two tracks and record it there - when done copy the guitar track back into the original project. This is to eliminate any latency that might occur.   Certainly worth the effort imo!!! Good luck :)"

Maybe sidechain the guitar to the vocals or make them duck out another way with stereo width adjustments. John Christian has a good video series on landscaping, essentially making each sound work together as a whole.  Also, if you play with a metronome how come it's hard to stay in time?  Organic sounds are better imo because if everything is perfect it sounds fake. I think a lot of people change the velocities and whatnot and the ending times of notes to make them sound like more realistic instruments.  Anyway it's sweet you're recording to add to EDM tracks!  edit: Christian*"
edmproduction,3drlqr,EzShmeezy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:24:04 2015 UTC,Record a riff and don't timestetch--cut the guitar at the transients and align them to the grid.

edmproduction,3dp99p,joeydendron,3,Sat Jul 18 10:16:10 2015 UTC,Many stereo imaging processors have a separate control for low width because of this.

edmproduction,3dp99p,SynthHacker,3,Sat Jul 18 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, which causes more significant phase cancellation when ""stereoizing"" (detuning, phase shifting, etc) bass timbres. When you slightly detune the second oscillator in a saw lead, you get a pleasurable widening because any amount of phase cancellation is overshadowed by the sheer amount of troughs and peaks not cancelling each other. Same principle when stereo mic'ing. When you do the same on a bass timbre, you hear nastiness immediately.  If you widen below ~200Hz you're probably going to get nasty phasing and our brains have a hard time making sense of it, which is why you might get the sensation that it's actually decreasing width while actually just making it more confusing. With a monitoring setup that accurately represents bass (which is really only rooms designed by acousticians) you can properly tweak the low width. For the rest of us, you want to decrease the width by your best judgement under 300Hz or so. Under 120-150Hz should be completely mono in my opinion."

If you listen to your sound clip in mono, the sound of the instrument has changed quite a bit. It's not necessarily bad, but when making music you definitely don't want your instruments to change sound when summed to mono. It would be fine for say supersaws, but they are already detuned/phased to hell and separating the left/right can ruin the wide feeling. I'm sure in some cases it would work though. Generally I prefer to find other ways to manipulate stereo width.  Edit: Although if you only pan the voices 50% then I guess it would be fine since it'll sound about the same in stereo and mono."

The man basically invented the concept of minimal techno 20 years ago,and to the day, the more you sound like him the better you probably are.   I mean, good lord, he's gotta be 50 at this point and Floorplan - Never Grow Old (Re-Plant) (for people who dont know, Floorplan is one of his aliases and the Re-Plant is his own remix of it) was THE track of 2014.

Also for Techno I think you can go a bit older with stuff by Kevin Saunderson or Derrick May. Something like Just Want Another Chance by Reese (1988) or Strings of Life by Derrick May (1987).  My vote for Italo Disco goes to Take A Chance by Mr. Flagio (1983).  For Deep House it's an absolute no-brainer: Burning by MK (1991) defined the genre and still does today.  So interesting that you chose Hobson's Choice for Garage. I remember chatting with one of the dudes who made that on ICQ and message boards way back in the day. He had to have been about 15 when the song came out. Had no idea of the impact of the song until years later.    Though for Garage, even though it's not UK, I think Todd Edwards deserves the credit for starting it with tracks like his Alabama Blues Remix in 1995. The sound was embraced and thrived in the UK after that.  I'd put Hobson's Choice more as a foundational track in the 2-Step realm rather than the Garage realm."

MK defined the sound that dominates the charts today called ""Deep House"", but he didn't define deep house, Ron Trent, Chez Damier and Prescription Records did.

Detroit techno comes with a strong jazz influence while french house is closer to disco or funk. The way the more traditional influences are utilized in the genre is very different too.  French house is much more about sampling and sample manipulation, combining different acousting elements electronically into funky, groovy vibes.  Detroit on the other side can be made with purely electronic sounds. It doesn't necessarily use sampling at all or if it does, it's usually percussions only. The other instruments are actually played and can easily be combined with real instruments. Take Galaxy 2 Galaxy - Hi Tech Jazz for example. The closes thing resembling real instruments is the whinny digital saxophone. Everything else is acoustic, even the drums are synthesized."

This music did come AFTER the techno in Detroit (right after), but nevertheless, the smooth sample based deep house started in Detroit, and its still the Detroit sound. KDJ, Sound Signature, Harmonie Park, Deep transportation, etc are all labels that started Detroit Deep House and are still going strong. I would differentiate them by calling deep house more....deep, I guess, introspective, hipnotic, etc, while french house is more upbeat.

edmproduction,3dn8vh,ishi_dnb_,9,Sat Jul 18 16:57:11 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you how to ""think"" when it comes to discovering new music (we called this ""crate digging"" when record stores were still a thing):  Think about the scene in addition to the songs. ""What are the classic tunes"" will get you started, but ""what/who were the best labels/parties/crews/DJs and what were they doing"" will get you farther. Check out the tracklists of recordings and look through discographies. Try to figure out who knew who judging by who appears on the same lists. Remember often times there's a divide between one little scene and the next so sometimes you'll just have to go back to Wikipedia or the Ishkur guide and pick a new place to start.  You can roughly measure the impact of something by the number of hits it has on youtube or the number of re-releases/appearances it has on Rolldabeats or Discogs. For example...  Fresh ""Signal"" isn't played much today and only has 16k plays on the Ram Records official channel. But if we sort the Ram Records discography by individual tracks we see it was on 8 releases (incl. an Andy C ""Nightlife"" tape and two Ministry Of Sound packs) so we can conclude it was a major classic at the time.  If we look at the Nightlife release deeper, we see a lot of big names (Fresh, Shy FX, Dieselboy, High Contrast, etc) but also two tracks by a guy named Twisted Individual. We've never heard of him and his individual page says he's released over 200 tracks so we'll look deeper. Turns out he's been remixed by G Dub/Original Sin and Drumsound & Bassline Smith, so he must be important, so we should check out his big tunes, like ""Rusty Sheriff's Badge"" (which is like an all-time jump-up classic btw).  If we check out the labels Twisted was signed to, we see most of his releases were on a label group called Formation, which has releases dating back to 1991 and started the careers of some major artists like DJ Hazard, John B, and Nero. And thus the journey continues...  To get started, check out Essential Mixes, Drum & Bass Arena or Fabriclive tapes, mixes by Andy C or Dieselboy or Friction, and the following labels: Ram Records, True Playaz/Playaz, Renegade Hardware, Hospital Records, Metalheadz, Valve Recordings, Full Cycle/V Recordings, Aphrodite/Urban Shakedown, Good Looking Records, Prototype, Moving Shadow, Formation Records, Virus Recordings  Good luck!  edited for brevity"

Frankie Bones started using breakbeats in a housey context in the late 80s. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0HozV9y3Vs  That took off in the UK, where Acid House was a thing (bleeps and TB-303s) and... out of that came the hardcore rave sound. The Prodigy came out of that sound, and less directly, so did Aphex Twin (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5UBYOv1G9A). Here's Liquid's Sweet Harmony from 1992... which has a house piano loop and soul vocals over a breakbeat: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW4YfSxBeAw  And I went to a club night where they played about 8 tracks that were imitations of Egyptian Empire's Horn Track: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lm9bdVeZiCQ - this is much less housey, and has massive sub bass.   By 1993 Jungle was purifying and getting a bit more sophisticated:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5meT63flnM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLnauf0aWzY (lots of dub influence here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THCj2AJuNVE  Interestingly, around this time there was a popular trick of looping slow dub tunes in with the breakbeats, then killing the breakbeats, playing the dub loop at half the speed of the breaks. That's most of the DNA for dubstep, which was invented in South London 10 years later.  In 1995, Goldie released Timeless.... and he's performing the album around about now with a symphony orchestra. That was the point Jungle/D&B started to go mainstream.  I lost touch with D&B around that time - when I next heard it a few years later, the emphasis had shifted from chopped-up breakbeats to programmed drum hits: boom... splat .... boom-splat style.  So yeh, if you're looking for the roots of drum & bass, it's hip hop breakbeats crashed into house, exported to the UK where it's exposed to dub influences..."

edmproduction,3do28x,Evo808,8,Fri Jul 17 21:06:01 2015 UTC,"Mid-side processing is a good starting point for advanced techniques. It gives you great control over the stereo field of your mix.   Parallel processing is essential, but i'm not sure I'd consider that advanced. Although it did take me way too long to impliment it in my own tracks.  Advanced processing techniques such as send effects sidechained by the input of the dry synth. Creates room for your synth, then washes out with reverb after the midi note ends.   Multiband compression is super useful, and can get pretty advanced. In the same vein, multiband sidechaining is helpful and kinda advanced I suppose.  Learning how to resample properly dives in to some advanced techniques. An example would be taking a kick-drum, processing it until it sounds nothing at all like a kick, then sampling that, re-implimenting it within the mix, and processing it again (can be done with anything).  Not really advanced, but a cool trick I've found is to use a CV out from a sidechain compressor, and using that CV to modulate some aspect of another sound. Doing this will give you real time modulation dependent on the sidechain signal.   That's all I can think of right now, but the above tricks have endless applications and can really beef up the mix when they're all implemented well."

edmproduction,3do28x,ronnocs,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:42:49 2015 UTC,"It can really help to think of all your sounds as a band onstage. You don't want every single instrument and singer sitting dead-centre, so you separate them; move the guitarists and amps around, etc.  Panning and level faders are very powerful tools to use before any EQ, compression, etc, takes place, and in a lot of cases, will help to fix stereo, space, and depth issues without needing to resort to tools like Stereo Enhancers and spreaders and that. It took me forever to realize just how much of a massive difference panning can make overall, so I hope it helps others out.  As mentioned, mid-side gives you huge control over your stereo field. Also consider depth and perception: brighter, drier sounds will appear more frontal in a mix, whereas blurred, or dulled sounds (like ones with lots of reverb) will seem more pushed back."

edmproduction,3doxry,ayrtonseri,3,Sat Jul 18 01:38:01 2015 UTC,"Room treatment is crucial (as well as layout of the room, position relative to monitors etc). You can buy the nicest monitors on the market but if you are in a tiny square untreated room, you will hear the room, not the speakers. To an extent you want to hear the room (and you want it to be a good sounding room, with just the right amount of diffused reverb)  The main aspects of good treatment for a spare room type studio are mid absorbers, bass traps, and diffusers.    When sound comes out of your monitors, your not only hear the part that hits your ears, but the reflections off all the walls, furniture, etc around you. Absorbers and bass traps are similar, with bass traps being made of denser material to absorb lower frequences. Foam is a popular option, but rockwool or fiberglass is much more effective (especially for bass traps) and can be DIYed pretty easily.   Diffusers are surfaces with different parts protruding at different lengths, which means the reflections arrive at different times and angles which serves to diffuse high frequencies.   check out this article (and everything else at SOS on room treatment, fantastic resource!)  https://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb06/articles/studiosos.htm"

edmproduction,3doxry,duggreen,2,Sat Jul 18 15:23:26 2015 UTC,"Simple test you can do. Play a song wave rising from low (like 20hz) up to around 250hz or so. Do you notice any notes to be particularly loud or soft? Once you get into the response range of your monitors, any large differences in volume are likely due to your room causing phase cancellation. If you have any unevenness in this test, then you would probably benefit from having some bass trapping in your room.  I have most of the corners in my room bass trapped from the floor to ceiling and I can definitely notice a difference when doing this test. For example 100hz (G) which was almost inaudible before can now be heard fairly well. I also have some wall panels and diffusors but in all honesty I have not noticed as much of a difference due to those as the bass traps. I think they are the most cost effective way to treat your room. Less than $100 and you could probably cover all your room's corners if you get lucky on Craigslist or if you have some DIY skills."
edmproduction,3doxry,SynthHacker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"One point that often gets overlooked is the listening level in the room. The lower the level of the speakers, the less the room is engaged. This is one of the reasons near field monitors are used. When we have small, full range monitors pointed directly at our ears from only a few feet away, we can listen at a level low enough to avoid engaging the room. A good setup of NF monitors is like a big pair of headphones."
edmproduction,3doxry,statmarker,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:50:01 2015 UTC,"Some people may disagree with me, but until you have the time/space/money to build a decent quality acoustically treated studio space, I'd recommend just relying most on a pair of high-end headphones, which take the room out of the equation completely.  Definitely still use your monitors for reference though."
edmproduction,3doxry,2caves,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:53:02 2015 UTC,thank you :) I was thinking that too but people always seem to dis headphones in general for mixing but it sounds like a good alternative for me.
edmproduction,3dnh3f,dream001,6,Fri Jul 17 18:26:09 2015 UTC,"Your songs will sound a lot less ""nice"" if you have a nice stereo image and mono them. What you're looking for though is phase cancellation issues and interfering frequencies. Phase cancellation is pretty self explanatory and should be evident if there's any problems when switching to mono. We switch to mono to help catch interfering frequencies because often times a stereo or panned sound may be out of the way of another sound in the same frequency range (ie one panned hard left and the other hard right), but when collapsed to mono the two sounds now come in equal amount from both speakers and get in the way of each other. It may take a while to differentiate between ""the sound of a stereo song made mono"" and ""the sound of a stereo song made mono with a bunch of phase cancellation and frequency masking"""

It may take a while to differentiate between ""the sound of a stereo song made mono"" and ""the sound of a stereo song made mono with a bunch of phase cancellation and frequency masking""   So what types of things can you do so those frequencies are not clashing when summed. I can really only think of trying to delay one side by a few ms. Is that true, or is there alternative things to do? Thanks!"
edmproduction,3dnh3f,meldaproduction,3,Sat Jul 18 01:53:22 2015 UTC,"One thing you can try is using more mono-compatible methods to create stereo separation.  For instance, one our favorite methods is spectral separation as implemented in MStereoSpread. The basic idea is that it applies opposing spectral changes to the channels - adding 3 dB at 1 kHz to the left, and subtracting it from the right - when you add them together back to mono, you get practically the original signal, but you still have separation in stereo.  And yes, don't save your mono check for last. Check throughout the mixing process."

edmproduction,3dnh3f,Cafe48,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:11:03 2015 UTC,"I have. I usually demo some sounds from a synth, and find something I like, but when doing that in mono the synths sounds have a lot of phase cancellation and sound weird. So do I mono from the DAW, turn off the synth effects and try to make the synth sound dry, then creatively add stereo separation effects later? I guess, but in the end you don't end up with the sound you started with."
edmproduction,3dnh3f,YoBroItsMo,3,Sat Jul 18 01:50:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of those synth presets are purposely made unnaturally wide to grab your attention. They purposely use phase cancellation to get a bigger sound. You don't need to use effects to make your mix wide. all you need is balanced panning throughout your mix. For instance, a supersaw lead is often made wide by simply layering different leads and panning them accordingly. I recommend looking more into synthesis so you can better sculpt your sound. It's a slow but very rewarding learning experience."
edmproduction,3dnh3f,Cafe48,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:34:20 2015 UTC,"Man, that's kinda blowing my mind. haha. I never would have thought to give mono compatibility this much importance. But now it is all making sense to me. I'm glad you mentioned the supersaw leads, because I almost immediately started thinking about how I could work with them. But layering and panning makes sense. But it is just so easy to just throw on a ping pong delay and reverb and call it good. I guess I'll have to be more mindful of when to use delay and reverb and focus more on layering and panning mono."

edmproduction,3dnh3f,C3G0,2,Sat Jul 18 10:30:48 2015 UTC,"I meant that they purposely shift the phase to create a wider sound. Lets say you have two exact sin waves (starting on the same phase - if you're doing this in Massive for instance, check the ""restart via gate"" option under OSC) and you pan them at opposites sides all the way, you will still hear them in mono. This is assuming you're sitting perfectly where you need to be in respect to your speakers of course. As soon as you move one of the waves slightly out off phase, your ears will discern that and hear two different things coming from the two speakers."
edmproduction,3dnh3f,siltho,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:41:13 2015 UTC,"Okay gotcha. I don't think this is really phase cancellation as much as it is phase shifting or simply creating differences between the left and right signals, but yeah you're right."

Get your balance right first 100%. I use avantone mixcubes for that because they'll tell you instantly how your mix is. Second, create two aux's, one that has stereo haasing on it, then the other is a mono aux. Feed whatever you need into each auxes and you might even decide you want a little more creative control, so you could make a pair of auxs for your drums, and then everything else. The key to a powerful edm mix is to pretty much have a really good mono mix (all the elements need to be present in mono), but also need to be wide for stereo.   In short, you basically need your whole song in mono so it plays on systems; EDC mainstage's sound was all mono. Nothing funnier then just hearing barely any synths and kick/bass. People still dance though... and a copy of your synths and some perc/mid range bass wide in stereo. Listen to your favorite tracks with just the sides solo'd with izotope ozone or something that lets you solo mid/side. You'll learn alot about the track. Also please don't over think it. Your best decisions are gut ones."

edmproduction,3dlurg,Need_a_Ladder,9,Fri Jul 17 09:09:53 2015 UTC,"Of course they can be. If you're starting with kicks, basically the formula is a sine wave that is modulated very quickly from a high pitch to a low one using an envelope. The amount of modulation, speed of the sweep and the envelope's curve shape all make a lot of difference to the sound, so play with them to get the sound you like. It's also common to add a 'click' of filtered noise at the start of the sound.  Toms can be done with a similar technique, but snares are a little bit harder in my experience. Lookup how the 808 did snares for a starting point."

I use the two in conjunction to keep the track fader close to zero, but that's just preference, I hate mixing with track faders ranging from +10 to -20, so I tune the fx chain to give a close to zero output, and the track faders fine tuning keeps it there...ish."

The way it does modulation is pretty unique in the way you can route one modulator(LFO, envelope, knob, all sorts of other interesting options) to lots of different controls in different amounts and directions. So you could have one knob that changes every single parameter in the synth precisely the amount you want.   Also, it has a great GUI because it only shows the parts of the synth you're using, which allows it to have tons of options without being cluttered and it's also very modular so you can route it however you need.   There's tons of stuff in it too, it has FM, subtractive, additive, some waveshaping, ring modulation, a very involved arpeggiator, tons of filter options, and lots of great built in effects.   I swear I don't work for them lol. It would probably fit your needs and is also a nice all around synth for just about any need."

Like... to recreate the sample almost exactly, you'd have to simulate a disco orchestra and band recorded with old techniques and equipment in specific acoustic spaces: that's about 7 different art forms to master.  For a soundtrack job I had to do something similar - and it was hard work, and I wasn't 100% satisfied with the result; I cut down the complexity by sticking to instruments I knew I had - drums, electric bass, electric piano, cheesy synth patches, sampled hand claps.... then, restricted processing to what I thought might happen in the 70s - like, gating the drums, not much reverb, valve compressor VSTs, no sub bass, not much bass at all really...  There are companies that specialise in sample packs of fake old-sounding loops, I dunno if there are any tutorials online that might help? Hard work though."

It's going to be tough recreating that exact sound in the box.  The good news is you can pick up a 3630 on eBay for next to nothing. You could also try running the sample through an mpc or another sampler to give it some more warmth and punch."

The whole thing emulates an audio rack, down to the way you want to wire things, so more advanced users can pull off some pretty ridiculous wiring to create new effects. But I digress.

Some of the effects and synths feel outdated in sound quality, but if you know what you're doing and can think outside of the box with the routing, you can achieve very professional results. Not to mention you can buy ""plugins"" now to update the rack a bit. I actually prefer Reason for mixing. I'll write the main midi parts and program the main synths in Studio One and then fill in the blanks with Reason as well as the mixdown.

When I was twelve or so I revisited Garageband but moved away from Apple's loops in favor of writing my own stuff in MIDI. I was trying to do hip hop stuff mainly because I had no real concept of electronic music outside of the ""Hamster Dance"" and Basshunter's ""Dota."" My freshman year of highschool, I stopped playing piano as much as I had been, got into dubstep (2009-2010 era Datsik ftw) and got FL Studio. From then until about the end of my junior year, I devoted a lot of my free time to making dubstep, switching from FL to Reason somewhere along the way.

But recently I broke my collarbone and I've been stuck inside with nothing to do so I decided to finally bite the bullet and just get into it. I've been using FL Studio and it's not as bad as I thought it was. It's fun messing around with Massive and learning all this new stuff is at least keeping me occupied."
edmproduction,3dismm,Secretplot45,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:56:19 2015 UTC,For as long as I can remember I've been interested in music but never had the patience or motor skills to learn how to play any instruments. Found Garageband on my mom's laptop in 2007 or 2008 and that was when I realised you could make music using nothing but a computer.  Took a couple of years to properly get into producing and a couple of years of struggling before I made something I was moderately proud of compared to an actual mastered release.
edmproduction,3dismm,IHateNilsBland,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:56:34 2015 UTC,"I listened to Aphex Twin's ""Richard D. James"" album.  The moment 4 started playing, I realized just what could be done with computers.  This album was a decade old by that point.  I had listened to Basshunter at the time, but Aphex Twin really made me want to take it seriously.  Before producing, I had no previous exposure to electronic music (the time from when I started listening to making it was about six months).  A couple years ago I discovered deadmau5, and started drifting more towards more mainstream stuff (Skrillex, Noisia, The M Machine, Com Truise), but I didn't come into this really digging EDM or anything.  So, while I've been making electronic music for eight years, I've only really been listening to a lot of it for 3.  I will say, though, that after listening to more music in styles I want to make, I have a better understanding of how to develop."

I really wanted to play guitar or piano, but eventually discovered I didn't have the motor skills to quickly and precisely move both of my hands separately and in asymmetric ways. I could play chords solo and melodies solo on piano, but never simultaneously. So I started dabbling in electronic music, which doesn't require you to actually play an instrument with both hands at the same time (although it helps). Now I can create the songs in my head without messing them up beyond recognition on classical instruments.  Of course this is not to downplay the skill required for electronic music production compared to playing instruments. They are both completely separate skills in my opinion and I know many classical musicians that get headaches even looking at all the buttons and knobs used in sequencers, synths and so forth."

You see, in my early, early childhood, my parents were Alternative Rock nuts. While my dad always had his James Brown and Motown, I'll always remember sitting in the kitchen, listening to The Pixies, Sonic Youth, and a whole cast of other bands when I was as young as three. The most important album I heard at that time was Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots by The Flaming Lips. That album made heavy use of drum machines and synths, which completely mesmerized me. From then on, Synthesizers would hold a special place in my heart.   As I grew up, I began to notice something odd. I experienced a near constant stream of music playing in my mind, none of which I could recognize. Walking down the hall in grade school or sitting in the back seat of the car was always accompanied by the involuntary creation of music in my mind. This, combined with my love of synthesizers, led me to pursue EDM production as a means to put this music out into the physical world, starting first with Audiotool, then a pirated copy of FL Studio and finally a legally obtained copy of Logic Pro 9."

edmproduction,3dlbkx,phacid,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:44:11 2015 UTC,"BTW, some quick tips for equalizing:   When you don't need bass in a synth (like in the melody/lead that goes over your kick), kill the low end (bass) completely. Otherwise the bass from the lead and the kick will clash and this will result in a cracking noise. Also clean the lowest end of the kick a bit, very low bass will almost always sound bad.  If you hear a cracking noise on the high end (or you just think the synth sounds uncomfortably high). Reduce a bit of the high end, this will make it sound smoother.  If you notice a very high peak on a frequency (you can notice this easily on a plugin like fabfilter) set the ""Q"" to something small to make a small peak downwards and remove a bit of exactly that frequency, this will usually make the sound much smoother to hear."

edmproduction,3dlbkx,Cafe48,3,Fri Jul 17 15:15:27 2015 UTC,"Switching to pro default/transient etc will not fix the issue; the samples will still stretch when being played at different notes.

edmproduction,3dlbkx,phacid,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:59:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah it does the trick if you pitch it with the knobs, normally when you pitch it (resample) the samples get shorter and longer.

edmproduction,3dgmqh,Bean_two,49,Thu Jul 16 02:57:24 2015 UTC,"It's crazy to think that five seconds of someone's life has been recalled, cut up, rerecorded, edited, utilized as many times and included in as many different songs and compositions as the Amen Break has been. Whenever you hear the Amen Break, you're hearing a specific moment in time nearly 50 years ago where one man performed one solo that people reveer even today. That's crazy to think about. There's nothing synthetic about it — it's completely organic, it's crazy, it's historical, it's living and it's unbelievable how fitting it is in so many different applications nearly no matter where you put it.  Gregory Coleman, the drummer for The Winstons, died as a homeless man in 2006, purportedly never earning a cent from any samples of his break."
edmproduction,3dgmqh,Chiafriend12,7,Thu Jul 16 06:06:35 2015 UTC,For those not familiar with the history of the Amen Break. Great informational video.
edmproduction,3dgmqh,cosine83,2,Thu Jul 16 07:29:13 2015 UTC,I've probably watched/listened to this four times or more.
edmproduction,3dgmqh,Chiafriend12,3,Thu Jul 16 07:38:27 2015 UTC,Same. I'm randomly reminded of the Amen Break at least once a year and it prompts me to listen to this. Initially heard it on a podcast years ago.
edmproduction,3dgmqh,cosine83,7,Thu Jul 16 07:40:05 2015 UTC,That's the incomprehensible dream I've thought about many times. Was just thinking about that tonight with Kevin Saunderson's Reese bass. I can't imagine the feeling of being ubiquitous with a very specific sound that has been revered for so many years. At least Saunderson has fared a bit better :-/
edmproduction,3dgmqh,TranscodedMusic,4,Thu Jul 16 13:14:23 2015 UTC,Once you hear and understand what a Reese bass/synth is you soon realise how pervasive it has become. Seriously you can hear it in everything! Long live the roller.
edmproduction,3dgmqh,retroshark,2,Thu Jul 16 14:45:58 2015 UTC,"At least Saunderson has fared a bit better   Much, much better for recognition, and probably pretty decently for money as well.

I love drum breakbeats and it never ceases to amaze me how to this day people are still finding new and unique ways of using those same classic breakbeats. Its one genre I just get so wrapped up in, and I admit its a lot of nostalgia (which I know some people disdain when it comes to electronic music) but the nostalgia is all part of it for me. I like to write songs that I think sound like they could have come out in 1996/7 but are in fact totally unique and modernised- just based off of an old and proven formula."

edmproduction,3dgmqh,bmz,2,Thu Jul 16 17:09:04 2015 UTC,"The history of the Japanese electronic music scene is pretty interesting.  In the 1990s there was a lot of collaboration and influence between Japanese producers and those in the German trance scene. This led to things like Denki Groove - Niji (Talla Xlc Rainbow Mix) which is one of my all time favourite tracks from this era (check it out from about 3:54). There's also:   Denki Groove - Niji (Paul van Dyk's Pot Of Gold Remix) Tokyo Ghetto Pussy - Everybody Get On The Floor [Pump It] Tokyo Ghetto Pussy - I Kiss Your Lips Mijk Van Dijk - Gamer's Night   There is also a healthy but underground psychedelic trance scene that has been around for a long time starting with labels like Trip Trap Records from the early 1990s and Rockdenashi Productionz more recently.  Then there's the legendary Tokyo club Womb: Richie Hawtin presents ENTER.Womb Adventure, Tokyo (December 14th, 2013). I really love this club.  Then there's Japanese techno producer and DJ Ken Ishi - Videoset Ken Ishii @ Fabrik - CODE 103 - (Madrid/ES) - 21-02-2015. You also can't go past Japan's answer to DJ Shadow, DJ Krush if you are into hip hop - DJ Krush - Kemuri .  There's also:   Ryo Murakami - Coke Steven Porter - Deed Stereociti - Klass   So as far as EDM goes there is a lot of Japanese producers and DJs out there, genre wise it doesn't really go beyond techno, house, deep house and various flavours of trance. I'm not aware of any Japanese producers in other genres such as electro or dubstep, but the music that is out there is pretty amazing (and has been going on for a very long time)."

That being said, you can take a listen for yourself and decide if they are good enough for you.  https://soundcloud.com/kusaji/retribution  I have noticed that they are lacking a tiny bit in the low end, but knowing that, you can properly spot check.

edmproduction,3dj38t,toiletennisracket,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:50:40 2015 UTC,"If you wanna get a little more crazy with it, you can take a synth with decent routing capabilities and at least two oscillators and two envelope generators (ASDR). One oscillator can be the pitched sub routed to EG 1, set with 20ms attack or so and a healthy release, say at least 100ms depending on the tempo and your needs. The second oscillator is your transient, so to keep the pitch on it the same, you will need to turn the keyboard tracking on it all the way down. Route it to the second EG and set an immediate attack time and a release of 30 to 50ms or so (it should be related to the attack of the first osc; if Osc 1 has attack of 30 ms, then Osc 2 should have a release of 35ms or something along those lines so that they blend, but don't clash or have silence between the two). That will give you a solid kick for you to tweak to your liking.  Note: The synth has to have keyboard tracking for each oscillator somewhere in the chain before they merge at the output or a filter or whatever. Osc 1 should have maxed out KBT. Also make sure it's in ""Mono retrig"" and not legato.  2nd Note: Make sure you have a fast pitch-down on the attack of the sub to help give it some initial thump."
edmproduction,3dj38t,Ragnatronik,6,Thu Jul 16 23:11:40 2015 UTC,"2 works great - separate tracks and sidechain. Cut the lows out of the ""kick"" so its sounds more ""clicky"" if that makes sense.

edmproduction,3dj38t,iamcapsun,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:18:24 2015 UTC,You could also split-band process and only pitch down the lower band. I don't really make genre's that use 808's (trap/bigroom/whatever) but the kick part and sub part sound like they have pretty defined bands they apply to.
edmproduction,3dj38t,nickboy98,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:15:54 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with the sub sample triggering at the same time as the kick although don't remove too much of the bottom end of the kick if you're trying to keep that 'knock' of heavier trap & carmack type drums. Rather than making the frequency space for the sub by EQ, sidechain the sub bass to the kick with a very fast release so that the sub kicks straight back in as soon as the kick ends. I'd say sample selection is most important though regardless, if you start with a sub & kick that don't work together and fill the right frequency ranges, it will be very hard to mold them together convincingly."
edmproduction,3dj38t,superphat808booty,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:12:11 2015 UTC,"Sub808Bass preset in Ableton playing in c0, c1 and c2. If you want to add more punch use transient presets from a VST like Nicky Romero Kick or I think serum bundles some samples that are labelled ""Kick Trans 1-9""  Use dynamic tube or saturator to fatten it up.  Considering that most trap producers (at least the ones signed to OWSLA or Mad Decent) are using Ableton, this it's probably how it's done.  The synth SubBoomBass by Rob Papen also has presets that are frequently used in trap/hip hop songs."
edmproduction,3dj38t,sinjinnn,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:29:11 2015 UTC,"Here's a method I discovered and has helped me intenesly with kicks and 808 bass notes: Have a top layer, kick with everything EQ'd out from under 80-100hz depending on the key of your track, and make the 808 bass/sub synth have a very fast pitch envelope in the beginning, like +12. That will help add that extra UMPH when the bass hits with the click, and bam. Super clean relationship between kick and bass :) if you want to add top layer distortion, just highpass over 120 hz, maybe a little sidechain, and go nuts!"

It was sampled a lot. Most of Jelly Belly's bassline (by S.P.Y.) is just 'Gro Bag' by Ed Rush & Optical. Sonic and Silver's 'Rocket Launcher' samples Daft Punk's Revolution 909. KillSonik blatantly samples Pendulum's 'Terminal' in their 'Pacifica' remix. Double 99's RIP Groove samples an older No U Turn track multiple times. Psycho's OST was sampled quite often too. I hope you understand what I'm saying: the list goes on and on and on. Sampling is happening everywhere, even though it's not always that legal. And no, I don't think anybody of them asked hundreds of artists to sample them. The whole EDM scene tends to jump back to older songs to sample them. http://www.whosampled.com/ is always a good source to look up, too."

edmproduction,3djidm,The_Real_DeFalco,2,Fri Jul 17 01:25:27 2015 UTC,"The general consensus is that if you haven't manipulated the sample enough to where it can't be easily recognized, you probably shouldn't do it at all unless you have the rights to do so. I'm not quite sure if taking one little sound could really count as illegal, but you should be good to go so long as it's not a signature sound that anybody could pick out of your song."

Yes, what you're thinking of is definitely illegal. The long answer? Fair use specifically has an exception for ""transformative"" works, such as collages, where you take the sampled content and use it for a purpose dissimilar to it's original use. What, exactly, ""transformative"" means is for the courts to decide, but if your usage of the sample is different enough from the copyright material, then you can use that sample for commercial purposes."

If you aren't famous or you aren't releasing it commercially it won't really matter.  Basically it's about the royalties, you can't sample modern songs but I think that after an amount of time they are royalty free (don't quote me on this).  But if you like X kick, you can sample it and get (for example) the low frequencies, not because it's legal, but because no one will recognise it."

edmproduction,3dc8sq,Chatlistic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:53:14 2015 UTC,"Depends on if it's bass or mid/upper.  Bass transients are distorted by too fast an attack, on top of every other reason people have already listed here."
edmproduction,3dc8sq,boom3r84,5,Wed Jul 15 06:20:49 2015 UTC,"Yup... you can also use a compressor to INCREASE the contrast between the attack of a percussive sound and its decay/sustain portion:  Say you've got a snare sample and it's sounding a bit flat, and you want it to be a bit perkier - maybe to cut through the mix more, maybe so you hear its snap but its tail doesn't hog the mix.  You can put a compressor on the sample's channel. Set the attack around 20 - 30ms (you can tune that later). Set the release fast - 20 - 30ms again (you can tune that too).  Now, when the snare sample plays, its fast attack will go through the compressor mostly unaffected... then, the compressor will pull its volume down over 20ms... adding a kind of envelope decay style of volume curve to the sample. If the snare's got a loud body, that'll keep the compressor active... when the sample tails off, the compressor will open up again.  To be honest, just make a channel with a snare drum playing on the 2 & 4, stick a compressor on it and see what you can do: if it's a superfast digital compressor, you can tune the attack and release to either flatten the sample completely (ultrafast attack, fast release) or make it snap (med-slow attack, fast-med release)  Then, play with basses, leads and vocals.  I read recently that in pop production, some mix engineers will use 2 or 3 different compressors on a single vocal, to affect the transients, or the overall level, or the harmonics... you can carry on learning about compression for years."

It wasn't specifically about this but it touched the idea of getting bored on a song. The main idea was to work on something specific for 20 minutes at a time and stop after twenty minutes, let it be melody writing, learning to compress, or learning how to use the vocoder. Just do it for twenty and then stop. If you don't stop you will find yourself getting excited about what you're doing and spend time on it only to find out hours later that you're bored and wasted your time. Not saying this happens every time but it does happen often."
edmproduction,3deln5,Ragnatronik,2,Wed Jul 15 23:52:03 2015 UTC,"What you should do is if you keep having new song ideas, keep making new files with those ideas. There will come a time where your creativity and imagination will run out and you can come back to these as already-started ideas that you can work on. You find them boring now but just wait awhile, they'll usually spark more ideas later.  Don't force yourself to finish a song if it makes you unhappy or bored, leave it alone awhile and come back later. After all the creation process is fun and enjoyable (or it's supposed to be) Eventually you'll find a hook or drum pattern that you really really like and you can then focus on that. If you force yourself to finish a song it's going to sound like you forced yourself to finish the song.  Now what works for me may not work for everyone, I'd suggest reading all the opinions on here and use their ideas to make YOUR  decision, since no one can produce for you"

It's taken me a long time to learn this and get comfortable with it, but whenever I get bored and start droning on a song for more than 20 minutes then I stop. I either start from fresh if I'm still feeling creative, or I take a break and practice mixing on some older stuff, or read a synth manual, listen to music- do things that I benefit from and that might even spark an idea to jump-start yourself out of the creative hole. You also need to eat, and enjoy the outside world :D  Finishing songs shouldn't be your goal. Your goal right now should be focusing on songwriting, synth programming if you use synths (or any gear that you use, get really comfy with it so you can focus on the music more than the sound design right now), and arranging whatever parts of your song you are able to finish. Song structure is very easy to learn in most popular styles once you get the basics of arranging and composition down. I've been doing this for 12 years and there's been times I didn't touch my DAW for months because I just wasn't feeling it. But I stayed active and did other things like learning how to play the drums, keyboard, and synth programming and later on when I had lulls it switched learning compression and other mixing techniques and whatnot.   Keep it up, man! In the end it can be a great professional career or an amazingly rewarding hobby."
edmproduction,3deln5,jaypohlman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:06:17 2015 UTC,"If you have the inspiration to continue writing, but your inspiration isn't for the project you are working on. Start a new project. The main point with finishing tracks is that you don't work hours and hours on a project, then let it sit and do nothing after a certain point. That is an EXTREMELY BAD and HARD habit to break, trust me....  If you can juggle two different ideas in a day that's great, three cool. But don't over extend your creativity. I personally can bounce between three different songs in a days sessions. Get solid ground and keep it moving.   Like /u/WorstEDMAdvisor said, you DO need to finishes these songs. So don't take on what you can't handle when making projects."

edmproduction,3deln5,Ragnatronik,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:13:13 2015 UTC,"I have a couple suggestions that I think will really help reduce boredom. You need to start learning how to work faster, which is tough for a beginner. But try to separate your sound design days (making cool synths and sounds) from your writing days. This way you will have a cool synth to inspire you to write right when you sit down and you won't be lazy and make a bunk ass synth after you just spent 3 hours on your drum rack. Also try creating a template in your daw with some of your favorite kicks and snares and sweeps and cymbals and all that. This way alot the boring shit gets cut out of your work flow."

I suggest u download the demo and try to see if the program is for u. With that being said, if ur dead set on getting fl studio, do urself a favour and buy the producer edition. Its gonna be worth it"
edmproduction,3dg21p,convicfelon,3,Thu Jul 16 02:00:30 2015 UTC,"If you're just looking at trying it and don't especially want to spend even $100, Tracktion 4 is free for Linux, Mac, and Windows (and version 5 and above includes Melodyne Essentials for monophonic pitch-shifting and time manipulation).  Also, consider spending $5 on an issue of Computer Music.  If you can find it and you're using Windows or Mac, Computer Music 200 has the full version of Cakewalk's Reaper synth.  Getting that and a current issue should get you plenty of quality instruments, plug-ins, and effects to get started.    If you don't have a MIDI controller or DAW, you might want to consider getting one of Auturia's Producer Packs."
edmproduction,3dg21p,rw-blackbird,2,Thu Jul 16 13:14:12 2015 UTC,"No audio recording would mean that you would not have the ability to record the audio from a microphone (vocals) or a guitar, bass or other instrument. You say that you play an instrument, this version of FL Studio would restrict you from recording that instrument into FL Studio to use in your song. This version of FL Studio would only allow you to use Midi and VST's which are virtual instruments such.  I would suggest getting the FL Studio Demo version since it is the full version, the only limitation is you can't save a project and reopen it. So this allows you to test the software."

edmproduction,3dg21p,poisonstings,2,Thu Jul 16 02:39:08 2015 UTC,Don't drop 100$ for audio recording. Record in another program and import the recording to fl afterwards (freeware like audacity etc.).

Flat speakers were ideal a few decades ago, but nowadays something with a subtle low/high boost would translate better to different systems.

If I feel some elements need some work, I work on these elements specifically, not on the master bus.  On my master I only have a clipper (GClip VST) at like 99% just to control my peaks and maybe an EQ if really I feel like the whole track has, for example, just a little bit too much mid-low or something. But it is going to be very few EQing and it is going to be at max a db in difference.  At least lately that's what I do. Have not released anything yet with that strategy but I'm working on that! (EP)  What I like with this method is that I don't f**k up with the dynamics of the whole track. Each kick, each snare, each bass hit, etc, I know they will be the very same everytime, just the way I want and I will mix the track to fit that."

Here are a couple of main points:   You don't want any parallel walls that create room modes Rockwool is generally considered the best kind of insulation for studios Look into the term 'decoupling'. To build an effective 'control room' acoustic environment (and even more so for soundproofing purposes) you'll need to know how to properly decouple the floor and walls. You should use plasterboard..but again, thickness and layering depends on what you're going for. Personally, my walls from outside to inside are 1 thinner layer of p'board...1 layer of green glue...1 thicker layer of p'board. On top of the inner layer is a faux suede fabric which has the right absorption coefficient for my room..and it also looks really nice.   The design plays a big part in how your good room will ultimately sound and smart preparation is the key to success. Do some sketches, work out the angles and throw them up in Gearslutz. Some of those guys have built many a professional studio and will give you great advice and suggestions."

edmproduction,3daoj2,webhead311,5,Wed Jul 15 02:21:17 2015 UTC,"It helps you make your mix fuller, because you can see if you are lacking a significant range of frequencies, and then you can boost them. You can also use it to see if any of your instruments are fighting, and then you can EQ them accordingly. There are more things that it can help you with, but I just listed the two that I find most important."

edmproduction,3daoj2,evileyemusic,8,Wed Jul 15 03:29:12 2015 UTC,The importance of ADSR envelopes. Before I even touch an EQ I'll tweak that and see how close I can get.   Also learning to see the track I'm working on as a sort of puzzle and crafting sounds to fit in the mix instead of sounding good on their own. It's all about how the sounds interact with each other. That also means composition and leaving out notes that are unneeded because they are already filled in the spectrum.
edmproduction,3daoj2,jordankw,2,Tue Jul 14 23:38:32 2015 UTC,How are you using ADSR to begin eq'ing?
edmproduction,3daoj2,H-conscious,4,Wed Jul 15 01:28:40 2015 UTC,"if you have a filter envelope, instead of adding high end through EQ you could instead make the decay longer or the sustain higher to make the sound brighter"
edmproduction,3daoj2,Polloco,3,Wed Jul 15 03:21:16 2015 UTC,"It's like shaping the sound so it fits within the track. Let's say you've got a pad playing with a slow rising attack and full sustain, but your mix sounds cluttered because it's fighting with a lead. You can try shortening the attack and lowering the sustain. This way the volume gradually lowers over the course of the held note and gives your lead more room."

edmproduction,3daoj2,voidtype,4,Wed Jul 15 04:25:55 2015 UTC,"My biggest realization is that manuals are great. The reference manuals have been so helpful for figuring out what knobs/buttons do what and why they do that. Often times a tutorial is too much/too indirect, but the reference manual is perf.  Also, I figured out a new (to me) way to work with drums in ableton. I've noticed how some producers seem to prefer to lay out their kicks, snares, hihats, etc. as clips in an audio track, instead of using a drum rack. As much as I tried this method it didn't really work for me; I missed how fluidly I could work with drum rack midi clips to create and edit beats. The thing about using a drum rack, however, is that it can be a pain in the butt to add on audio effects. Basically, what I now like to do is to keep all of my drum sounds in a drum rack for ease of editing and creation, but then have the drum rack be set to ""send only,"" and have other audio tracks receive the sound of different parts of the drum rack (so a kick track, a snare track, a hihat track, a toms track). I'll do all the processing and grouping/bus-ing/whatever on the audio track instead of inside the drum rack. This works for me.  tl;dr: read the software's manuals when you have questions. I like drum racks that are send only, and process the drums how I please in separate audio tracks."
edmproduction,3daoj2,statmarker,2,Wed Jul 15 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"I will have to try that with the drum racks and separate sends. Drum racks are great for writing beats, but being able to process each sound separately is important too."

The main thing that is the hardest part to figure out is like the others have said, Flume's synth has a bass component to it. The bass portion is what really makes you feel the synth as it ""whips"" in and out. If anyone figures out this part I'd love to know how to do it.   It also might help to know that Flume almost exclusively uses sylenth for his synths. At least that's what I've read."
edmproduction,3dc9gt,ViolentSkies,6,Wed Jul 15 03:37:52 2015 UTC,Use a spectrum analyzer and look at the frequencies. This should help you a lot by telling you how they mixed and mastered their track.
edmproduction,3dc9gt,poisonstings,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:17:19 2015 UTC,Indeed. It's very useful to see where particular elements are hitting/the curve of the spectrum etc. Also I've found it very useful to throw a LUFS analyzer on the track to compare the loudness to my own track.
edmproduction,3dc9gt,TranscodedMusic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 05:23:18 2015 UTC,"What is a LUFS analyzer? I searched it up on google, and I still don't really understand what it is."
edmproduction,3dc9gt,poisonstings,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:57:41 2015 UTC,It's a standard to measure loudness (as opposed to RMS measurements which do now always reflect loudness). VisLM is an example of such an analyzer.
edmproduction,3dc9gt,TranscodedMusic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:23:26 2015 UTC,So it's pretty much an amplitude over time graph?

As I said, I mostly use it to complain a track I'm working on with a reference track to see if I'm in the right ballpark."
edmproduction,3dc9gt,TranscodedMusic,2,Wed Jul 15 17:42:11 2015 UTC,Ah ok.
edmproduction,3dc9gt,poisonstings,5,Wed Jul 15 18:07:45 2015 UTC,"What you're basically doing when referencing your tracks is gathering information on things like loudness, stereo image, signal etc. Combining that information with the information your ears are giving you (how it sounds) will help you make decisions on where to go with your mix compared to someone else's mix. I've actually written a piece about this on my website yesterday.   So I'll just do a copy/paste of that one, hope it helps you with your referencing.   What’s happening in my lows? What’s happening in the lows of that commercially released and great sounding track? And what’s the difference between the two? How loud are the vocals in that track compared to the vocals in mine? Why does my track sound so shallow and narrow while the other track sounds so loud and wide? All (and more) questions that might pop up when you’re comparing your tracks to the tracks of others. Referencing your tracks, comparing them to other tracks and zooming in to details can really help you see what’s going on in your mixes.  It’s (not) as simple as A/B (/C) When references your mix-downs it’s always a good idea to turn down the reference tracks to roughly the same volume as your mix-down. Ideally this will be somewhere between -3 and -6 db, so there is some headroom left for mastering. However, when you’re referencing your track with the master chain on, you shouldn’t turn down your reference but use it as it is. Now while it is very simple to just switch between the one track and the other, I personally prefer to be able to zoom into the details of what’s going on. I have a specific reference chain for this purpose which works really well for me, which I’ll explain below.  Multi-band processor (compressor/imager/eq etc) I always start of with a multi-band processor. It doesn’t really matter what sort of processor it is, compressor, imager etc. As long as you can solo the different frequency bands. It’s important though that the plugin shouldn’t though any processing. So in case of a compressor, make sure the threshold is above the signal so it isn’t actually compressing. Now set the bands to cover the subs, the lows to mids, the mids and the highs. As you’ll understand, checking these specific bands is as easy as using the ‘solo’ button on the bands. Be sure to keep the crossover frequency in mind though!  Mid / Side Processor I always use a1StereoControl for this, which has become a tool I can’t live without over the past year. Using this tool you can solo the mids and sides, meaning you can solo the mono and the stereo information. Now combining this with the multiband processor above, you can already see where we’re going.For example, if you solo the highs in the multi-band processor and the sides in the M/S processor, you will hear exactly what’s going on there. Now combining this with visualizers and meters, and of course by using your ears, you’ll get very valuable information!  Spectrum Analyzer My personal favorite is Voxengo Span, which can be used to view your spectrum. It has several modes and settings which makes it a perfect tool for pretty much any situation. For example; the lo-freq preset can help you zoom in on the low-end information. While the ‘stereo mastering’ preset is perfect for the overall visual feedback on your track. It also has a correlation meter, but also some other extensive metering.  Metering This depends totally on your personal taste. Although I would suggest a meter that supports peak, RMS, correlation, LUFS. Basically just an extensive meter. TT Dynamic range meter  is a good free one, that supports most of these things.Hofa also has a great free metering plugin, which supports most of these protocols as well.  Stereo Analyzer / Visualizer For example a gonio-meter or vector scope. This is a way to visualize the stereo image and any phasing that might be going on in your mixes. Hofa plugins offer a great free tool for this called the ‘Hofa Goniometer & Korrelator‘. A great way to visualize and see the difference between tracks that sound wide, and those that don’t.  Waveform Visualizer I personally use s(m)exoscope for this one. It visualizes the outgoing signal as a waveform, showing you exactly what’s happening there. This way you can visually see any peaks, but for example, also the way compression affects the signal.  Multi Tool VPS Scope from Vengeance is a plugin that is distributed freely (both by itself as well as together with the Computer Music Magazine). This plugin offers metering, a signal scope (with extensive options), spectrum analyzer, and severel stereo meters. Definitely worth looking into this one as well! \  Tools of the trade Now that you have all the tools that you need, you can really start comparing your tracks in a much more elaborate way than just a/b’ing them as they are. To give you a few examples;  a) If you want to see what’s happening in the sides of your bass, solo the sides in your M/S processor and solo the lows (not subs) in your multi-band processor. Now check your visualizers, meters and stereo analyzers and use your ears. Check how your bass sounds in the sides and check how the other tracks sounds. Are they sounding similar? Or is there a big difference?  b) Want to hear what’s happening with your stereo info as a whole? Simply solo the sides and check it on the meters, visualizers and imager. With some M/S eq’ing on your master, you might be able to bring your track to the next level  c) Want to check the body of the vocals? Most part of any vocal usually sit in the mids of your frequencies and are also mostly in the mids of your stereo information. Of course male vocals are usually a bit lower than female vocals, so the bands could be adjusted to that. You could also turn it around and solo the sides. This way you can hear the tricks that are used to make a vocal sound bigger. Doubling, stereo delay, reverb. etc.  d) Want to compare loudness? Simply use the meters. Check RMS, lufs, peaks etc. See how any changes in your mix-down affect the signal.  As you can see there are a lot of options here which can provide you with tons of information on your mix-downs. This information can help you make thought-out decisions in your mix-down and mastering process, however it’s important to always keep using your ears as well!

edmproduction,3dc9gt,Detroit808,2,Wed Jul 15 05:05:33 2015 UTC,"I found various posts that say ""duh, well turn the reference track down then"" and you can do it by ear - literally make the ref track quieter until you perceive it at the same volume as your own mix.   Here's a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3MvshipsN4)  Also... be careful about routing: if you've got mastering plugins on your master output, and you're playing the ref track through them... you're double-mastering the ref track.  I don't do much A-B stuff in the DAW - I tend to just listen to other tracks in Spotify and get depressed about how good they sound. But when I do use A-B in Cubase, I make a ""mastering"" group channel and route all my mix to that; the ""mastering"" group has any mastering plugins I'm using on my mix, and it routes its output to ""Stereo Out"" - Cubase's main out. Then, if I route my ref track directly to ""Stereo Out""... BYPASSING my mastering group... then I'm comparing my mix (with home-made mastering), with a ref track that's already been mastered. That's about the fairest I think you can achieve.  PS Don't take this as advice to start using mastering plugins on your own project. I just struggle to write music without hyping the master mix a bit."

edmproduction,3ddzt3,Ajizi,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:45:00 2015 UTC,"because the native sidechain function has a problem with it. if you sidechain a kick directly to another channel, it picks up the effects on that channel, so for example: if you sidechain a kick to a channel with reverb on it, all the reverb will also transfer to the kick."
edmproduction,3ddzt3,instupendo,2,Thu Jul 16 12:15:54 2015 UTC,"Could be completely wrong here but I'm pretty sure that can be solved by turning these off. That way the limiter still picks up the information being sent to it for sidechaining, but the effects on the channel aren't applied."

edmproduction,3ddzt3,coranns,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:15:39 2015 UTC,"Sidechaining, to me, is best done with the Fruity Limiter. You just route a mixer track you want to sidechain with to the mixer track you need to compress. Then you place a Fruity Limiter on the ""compressed"" track, go to the ""COMP"" tab, change the channel to the one you need (Right clicking shows names of mixer channels). Then you can dial in compression easily and with a good visual indication of how much compression is happening.  There are other ways, but this is (in my opinion) the best way."

edmproduction,3ddzt3,CROIXsound,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:11:31 2015 UTC,"This is what I commented here:   I tried different methods of sidechain compression in FL Studio and use different methods depending on the effect I'm going after.  The best and most accurate method I make use of is the following: When using the Peak Controller I assign a separate (secondary) Kick with a short decay to a separate channel, using the same pattern as my primary kick, and remove the link to the master channel (or optionally keep the mute option enabled). A Peak Controller is added to the Kick channel. I then add a Fruity Compressor to the channel that I want a sidechaining effect. After adding the Fruity Compressor I right-click on the threshold knob and select 'link to controller', then select the 'Peak' option in the 'Internal controller' drop-down menu and finish by selecting the '1-Input' (Inverse) option in the 'Mapping formula' drop-down menu, clicking accept and play around with the Ratio knob in the Fruity compressor as well as the option in the Peak Controller.  The above method basically makes use of a 'ghost kick' to do the sidechaining and I've found it uses much less cpu than the 'Fruity Limiter sidechain' method. You will then have no problems with automated volume knobs. You can use a short snare with a short decay too. By using a short sound and playing around with the release knob on the compressor and the peak controller will help you sculpt the sidechain effect better.  Other methods that will also work well are the 'Nicky Romero Kickstart' and 'Xfer LFO Tool' plugins, but I use different methods with different genres.   This how I do it and I hope this will help in some way."

edmproduction,3dae72,ltruong,6,Tue Jul 14 21:00:53 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone thinks you have to have your faders super low. In FL Studio, you can having every channel peaking way above 0dB... FL Studio supports 32-bit floating point so the internal ceiling is about +1500dB - insanely high.   The only thing that's going to cause clipping is if the MASTER channel is peaking above 0dB when you render. If the master is peaking above 0dB while you work, that's fine. As long as you lower it/limit it before you render. You can have 50 mixer channels peaking at +5dB, but if your master channel is peaking at -0.2dB, there will be no clipping/distortion."
edmproduction,3dae72,Cafe48,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:29:20 2015 UTC,What's the benefit to doing this versus just mixing with a peak of -6 db? Is it more of a work flow situation?  I see a lot of guys on fl doing this so I'm just curious.
edmproduction,3dae72,ltruong,4,Tue Jul 14 23:40:15 2015 UTC,"The only thing that matters is that when you export your project, the master channel is below 0dB. That's it. If you're sending your mix to be mastered by a mastering engineer, you'll want the master channel to be peaking at about -6dB, because the ME will want some room to work with. But it's really not necessary to spend the entire project worrying about peaking at -6dB or 0dB or wherever - you can simply lower the volume of the master when you're done."
edmproduction,3dae72,Cafe48,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:46:53 2015 UTC,Hmmm. Maybe I'm not fully understanding the point though. Excuse my ignorance but what is the main benefit of having such loud faders?

[e.g. (EQ->comp->distort->lim.)]   Linear Phase EQ, Saturator, mono the bass frequencies under 80Hz, multiband compression, limiter, and analyzers at the end of the chain.  Not every track needs all this.   Do you generally use reference material, or are you ears just used to what something should sound like?   Always have some sort of reference material. Ask the producer for a few songs that they like the mixing/mastering of.   When using multiband compression, how much gain reduction do you usually see? How much gain reduction is too much?   This is completely subjective to the song, maybe solo specific frequency bands in the reference and see how it compares to the song you're mixing.   With harmonic excitement, do you ever distort the bass (below 120hz)? What areas in the spectrum do you distort the most and the least? What type or types of distortion are your favorites for  mastering?   Wouldn't really go below 60-80 as it tends to muddy the mix often, though this is also case-by-case   When using a maximizer, how much gain reduction do you usually see? How much gain reduction is too much? Is it common to see almost as much gain reduction on the main synths as the drums?   If you have to keep asking these questions, you really practice the basics of compression and have a better understanding of what it is doing. There's no specific amount of gain reduction you should be doing. This is something that varies EVERY song. Treat every song differently, don't think you need a fuckton of plug-ins on the master if it sounded good to begin with.    Do you use dithering on every track? If so, how is it usually shaped?   Do some research on dithering.   What are some common mistakes you usually hear with mixdowns that even experienced producers do?   Depends on how experienced the producer is. Gain staging is probably the most common though.   Any other subreddits that I'd get better answers on?   /r/audioengineering   And last..

edmproduction,3d5p94,BrotherBringTheSun,1 point,Tue Jul 14 03:29:18 2015 UTC,"You misunderstand my meaning, I think. The reverb would be shifted to one side, as would the vocal slightly (or dramatically depending on how you dial in the effect). This is not something you're trying to avoid, it's exactly what panning does (shift the sound to one side) and people use that constantly.  If you don't use panning in your production I highly propose you look into that, it's a great way to ""make room"" in your productions. If you do, then I'm not sure what point you're trying to get at exactly."
edmproduction,3d5p94,djaeke,3,Tue Jul 14 04:29:43 2015 UTC,"What he means is that a longer/louder reverb on one side would shift the whole vocal to sound tilted to that side. Lead vocals are rarely panned towards a specific side since that would feel like the mix is leaning toward that. In headphones especially it might not sound so great. In the video that the post is referring to the dude eventually shortens the decay of the ""longer"" side so that the overall effect sounds more balanced."

edmproduction,3d5p94,BrotherBringTheSun,0,Tue Jul 14 14:36:48 2015 UTC,"Lol wut? Mixing is literally all about balance. If you're panning an element left you should theoretically be complimenting it with something panned right, obviously people break that rule, but having an unbalanced mix is about the worst thing someone can say about it. This is why we say things like ""try to use one reverb or similar spaces on all elements"" and ""group similar elements together and glue compress them"", the goal of a mixing engineer is to make everything sound as cohesive and smooth as possible."

edmproduction,3d5p94,prolific13,2,Tue Jul 14 11:12:36 2015 UTC,I think you would get even better results if you mute the predelay or IR on the side channels and then put one reverb on the main channel with only predelay/ir so stuff dosnt get messy. Also setting up the two side channels as sends instead of copies would allow you to edit (destructively or not) and add fx to the main vocal without having to copy all the changes over.

A lot of times these loops will have some really cool random/unique hits.  I like to throw the drum loop on top of my already programmed drum loop, then I'll cut out the kicks, snares, and hats, usually only keeping the random filler hits. You can end up with some really unique sounds and patterns this way that you wouldn't have normally thought of.   Also for little effects fills it can often times be really handy to snip just a really tiny portion of an FX sample and throw some crazy processing on it.  And finally I'd recommend messing with video game samples if you're at all interested in anything glitchy. Sega Genesis games were all set to FM synthesized music. Samples from most games are readily available online. Just grab em, cut em up, and you'll have some really unique glitchy sounds."

BUT if you're not about that synthesizer life when you're working with samples, my personal favorite sampler in FL Studio is Slicex. It's a little wonky to figure out at first, but it can be really good for doing some nuts chops. Combined with slide notes in the piano roll, you can get some really complex sounds really fast. It's just kind of a bitch to keep track of stuff in it if you don't want to go through and label millions of slices.    As for specific things to try out, I really like to take any sample, chop out a stupid tiny bit (like turn off snapping and go waay small), select it and hold ctrl+b to get a shit ton of them in a row, then automating the volume of the sample so it fades in or fades out.

So the monitors were about 8 feet apart and forward facing and even then the worker sat in the chair and played different songs.. Also the hs8 sounded amazing to me which threw me off.. I thought those were supposed to be the best and flattest but they sounded bright and crisp and beautiful I want them for personal listening. Nothing like I thought monitors should sound like.. And nothing like the rest of the monitors there. I'm going to go to the one in my home town in the next week or two and give it a second shot. Thanks for the advice man!
edmproduction,3da6jn,manudiao,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"The events are great definitely, slightly bigger than 6"" though (at like 7 inches) and more pricey than what you're looking for. The only problem is the low end isn't always perfect on them, but besides that I've noticed no serious distortion in any other range. They're really hard to beat for the price though! I had to get isolation pads for them (a bunch of monitors benefit from this as well)"

You can just drag Logic's auto-detected transients (or add your own) to match the lines in the ruler at the top of the arrange window, and voila, perfect timing, as long as you don't stretch them too far.  If you want a quicker way of stretching something, just hold alt while trying to expand a region and it will time stretch however far you drag it. You don't have to turn on flex mode for this."

edmproduction,3d4pg2,xijaro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 06:28:40 2015 UTC,Quick question: how much sound does your Subpac make when you're using it at that high intensity?  My S2 usually just get's too noisy beyond 60% for use with monitors or open-back headphones. I love the vibrations but the rattling sound just starts leaking into the music. I asked Subpac customer support about it but they were not helpful.
edmproduction,3d4pg2,npcompl33t,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:25:46 2015 UTC,I normally don't turn it past 50% - but there can be some resonances with my chair. It normally doesn't get too bad though. (I have an s1 - not sure if that makes a difference).
edmproduction,3d4pg2,Jaalmakadamia,3,Tue Jul 14 21:06:55 2015 UTC,"Listening to music with a Subpac felt to me like when you are doing sound tests on a bigass system a few hours before the party starts.   If you intend to have your music played on a loud  system, having properly balanced low-frequencies can make a big difference in the end result and the Subpac can help if you don't have a subwoofer."

edmproduction,3d4pg2,kietkat,2,Mon Jul 13 16:33:47 2015 UTC,It doesn't only affect your mixing decisions but way more importantly your composition. You are less likely to leave a cross spectrum mess and actually get more in touch with the groove/vibe/feel of the track while you write it. Edit: I don't own a subpac. I sort of build one myself using a tactile transducer in a pillow. Is it good for mixing? Hell no. Does it help with in the writing process? Yes.
edmproduction,3d4pg2,trptd,2,Mon Jul 13 14:53:26 2015 UTC,"Hmm interesting. Could one argue that it only helps the writing process artifically? Much like how headphones with boosted bass can trick new producers into thinking their mix is heavy in the low end when it actually is not. Could it cause me to become biased when writing music because I will make it appealing for a listener with a subpac, but not one without?  Or am I thinking about it all wrong? I suppose it does't really matter that much because the frequencies I'd be working with wouldn't normally matter much on a ""normal"" system anyway."
edmproduction,3d4pg2,Someoneoldbutnew,2,Mon Jul 13 15:38:32 2015 UTC,"Yes you are thinking about it all wrong. I own one. I made a post about it here a few months ago. It is supposed to take the place of a traditional subwoofer. It isn't a gimmicky bassbooster device, its an accurate sub bass monitoring device that will give you a lot more sub detail than your monitors or headphones. You do not make your music for a normal system, you make EDM for the clubs and festival stages."
edmproduction,3d4pg2,Oliie,2,Mon Jul 13 17:05:11 2015 UTC,You'll know how awesome these things are when you remix the sub in your pre-subpac tracks and compare the old to the new with the pac disabled.

edmproduction,3d7xay,PanzerDuff,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:19:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry, more crap from me... I got proper annoyed at that ""don't touch compression"" stuff, which I guess got modded in the end because it was so toxic, I'm trying to make up that psychic debt.  There's another excellent series of videos with Steve Duda (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BjvrHOARC00) explaining how he makes space in mixes... basically it sounds like he's carving space into the mix at lots of different levels: using tools to change the envelopes of sounds to make them snappier, introducing sounds loud, then fading them down a little so listeners get impact, then there's space again... EQing to make space, especially high-passing (don't religiously stick to ""40Hz for kick, 50Hz for bass, 100Hz for everything else"" either, every mix will be different but high pass filtering and subtractive EQ in general will always be a powerful tool to help make space).  So yeh, weeding the garden, chipping away at sounds to make space, chipping away at the arrangement maybe, cutting frequencies with EQ to make space.  If you're layering, you can plan what frequency bands your layers will occupy, don't just throw 3 broad-spectrum supersaw leads on top of each other. A combination of clean or only gently overdriven sub bass, gritty upper-mid-range and very thin, very high-pass-filtered top-end fizz from a synth or some crackly sound... that can work well, because all frequencies are there but not conflicting. And maybe you can have 2 bright supersaws from different synth patches... if they're only top end, and maybe they're panned hard left and hard right? That might work.  From the tracks I've heard in the past few days, it feels like 808 sub bass or synth sub bass is the deepest sound, EQ wise - down to 40Hz-ish before it rolls off. Non-808 kicks... play with high-passing them anywhere from 50Hz up to 120Hz, see what works, every mix is different. Sometimes a high-pass that cuts off slightly higher than you think, with a gentle boost just at the cutoff frequency, works well. I've started doing that on kicks, and I quite like it at the moment.  Claps and high hats... you can high-pass those quite hard. The percussion at the start of this one (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rNayfs9k74)... I swear the claps and highs have got nothing below 1000Hz. They just tinkle away, and all the energy's in the clean subs below the synths. The lead synths are skinny too, have a listen to the distorted acid lead and the growls around 1:30 - 2:10... skinny lead synth over surprisingly subtle, cleanish sub bass?"
edmproduction,3d7xay,joeydendron,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:30:11 2015 UTC,"Oh yeh, compression:  You can use a slowish attack (20 - 30ms or so) and a fastish release (20 - 30ms again) to emphasise the snap at the start of a percussion sound. Because it takes the compressor 20ms to close down, it won't reduce the volume of the start of the sound; but then it WILL reduce the body/decay/sustain of the sound. So compression can kind of INCREASE dynamic range, in a way, kind of like an envelope, by chipping into a sound.  Sidechain compression obviously... Google for tutorials, it's really good fun. It's not only for sidechaining the bass with the kick, either: you can sidechain a pad with a lead synth... you can sidechain a reverb send from a whole percussion sub-mix if you want, so the reverb ducks out of the percussion's way, but wells up when the beat stops. Plus, even when I don't write bass notes on top of kicks, I still sidechain the bass with the kick, because the compressor still shapes bass notes that fall slightly after the kick, so it still makes the bassline pump.  One really helpful piece of advice is, use EQ subtractively (most of the time)... again, partly because it helps sculpt space into the mix.   Well, those 2 examples above are using compression subtractively: to make space, not just to make something loud.  Sculpting. Back to that NGHTMR video... he shows how he goes from an 8 bar loop to a whole 3-minute song: he duplicates the loop out to 3 min, then he goes through deleting blocks from the timeline. Sculpting the arrangement. Then I guess he goes in and does the same on a more detailed level.  Steve Duda sculpts tracks with arrangement, with mixer faders; he sculpts sounds with envelopes, with his LFOTool plugin, with transient shapers, with compressors. Subtractive EQ carves space into the frequency spectrum of the track.  Um, and once you're happy sculpting, you can start mixing groups of tracks together through shared EQs or compressors or saturators (keep a light touch though), because when you process sounds together that way it makes them feel like they belong together."

edmproduction,3d7xay,Joea2821,0,Thu Jul 16 05:25:05 2015 UTC,"I've heard a good starting dB level for your master is -6dB. As for things overlapping you can use EQ to ""carve"" out certain frequencies that may be overlapping. Search subtractive EQ so you can get a better understanding of it. Sidechain compression also helps overlapping of kick and bass.  I'm still learning as well but I've been producing for a while and I know some of the technical stuff. I'm by no means an expert but this is just what I've learned from watching videos and producing. Hope it helps!"

edmproduction,3d7xay,Cafe48,2,Tue Jul 14 15:42:55 2015 UTC,"Lol that happens a lot. But in this case, it's probably because -6dB is a good FINAL level for your master, and that's only if you're planning to have it mastered by someone else. It almost doesn't matter where your master is peaking at first. Most DAWs support 32-bit floating point and can't technically clip internally."
edmproduction,3d7xay,anthonybouzi,0,Tue Jul 14 22:41:29 2015 UTC,"When I do my mixdowns, I drop all the faders (excluding master) to -inf, then I bring my kick up to -10dB. After that I mix the bass, drums, synths and FX to fit around the kick. This way you'll have heaps of headroom for your master and with enough compression and EQing, you should have a tight mix.  Also, if you don't want different elements of your track to interfere and clash, make sure you EQ and pan the sounds to give them their own space in the mix."
edmproduction,3d7xay,joeydendron,0,Tue Jul 14 10:22:58 2015 UTC,"Compression is definitely something to do with it. Definitely, definitely.  The advice about starting with the kick, setting the fader so the master peaks at about -10dB, is pretty good. Then, you might find if you mix your other elements around the kick, you'll end up with the master around about -6dB anyway.  Arrangement's important too. There's a good Q & A/tutorial video with NGHTMRE (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jl-LnAYjoM) and he plays an early track where lots of different elements in his arrangement are fighting each other; then he plays a later track written after he learnt to simplify, and always arrange so that there's one element that the audience should obviously listen too. Maybe it's a full-stack huge sound made of 5 layers... but it comes across as one sound, one element for you to listen to.  Personally I hesitate about placing bass notes on top of kicks. I know I could use complicated shit like multi-band sidechained compression, but sometimes it's easier to just arrange the track so there's no problem there in the first place.  There's an extension of that idea... I think it's got a name but I forget what it is... where you write your percussion so only one drum is playing on any given 16th. Works better for some styles than others, but it's more like you're writing a tune using drums, than making lots of griddy layers. Tends to result in something catchy, easier to remember (maybe cos it's closer to you being able to beatbox it/sing it?), and much cleaner in the mix."

Sometimes people overcompress things, but compression is a very important part of mixing, especially if you have vocals or any recorded instruments.  There are no set frequencies to high pass. Use your ears, and only high pass when needed. Especially when you are synthesizing your bass, there is no need to high pass. The fundamental frequency of your bass is the lowest frequency and is where the power of the bass comes from. If it's too low then you need to rewrite your bass line, don't high pass it."

It's useful for adding other melodic elements besides your main synth. I was recently inspired to use a heavily distorted guitar as the main bass sound for a dubstep track, and it worked amazingly well.  Just like any type of synth or instrument, you have to be really careful with EQing since electrics produce a crapton of overtones that can mess with the rest of your sound design. Also, didgeridoo samples are rad."

edmproduction,3d534p,CABmusic,3,Mon Jul 13 16:48:05 2015 UTC,"Good question. I record my own guitar into the DAW using a direct input (DI) box. You can add effects like distortion, compression (really important for mellowing out the transients from picking), reverb, etc. in the DAW, but I prefer to run my guitar signal through effects on my pedal board before it goes into Ableton because digital amp and effect modelers like Guitar Rig have never really done it for me.  Even the type of pickups on the guitar heavily affect how well it mixes. I've found that single-coil pickups tend to be less disruptive in the mix because they don't produce quite as much harmonic content as humbuckers.  You can probably get away with using samples or something if you don't have a guitar, that's just the way I do it."

The long stretches would be a result of getting a sound or idea I like and just getting so into it that I end up hitting that amount of time. An average day, if I have something already started, would be like 8 hours ~ 11am to 7 or 8pm.   If I didn't genuinely love doing it so much I'd probably have lost my sanity by now.

edmproduction,3d624d,MidniteDD,3,Mon Jul 13 20:24:11 2015 UTC,"Every device you use will ""color"" the sounds that you play through it (for example, beats by dre headphones and car stereos have enhanced bass, while phones can't reproduce low end very well, so often the mid-range will be emphasized)  Basically Noah's talking about making sure that the song you're making translates to every system, without inconsistencies in the mix. When I was a beginner, often times I'd play my tune in a car and think ""damn, that snare is way too loud... but it sounded good on everything else i referenced it on?"" It's important that everyone has the same listening experience, because the initial impression is usually what determines whether or not you have another fan/follower.  tl;dr reference your shit on as much as possible so it sounds consistent on every system."
edmproduction,3d624d,lataille,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"All too familiar with your car example. You mention that happened when you were a beginner, what do you do to prevent that now?"
edmproduction,3d624d,OG-Mudbone,2,Tue Jul 14 18:40:18 2015 UTC,It is called mastering.
edmproduction,3d624d,yeusk,2,Mon Jul 13 20:29:44 2015 UTC,"Mixing too but yeah. Use more than one set of speakers or near fields. Check it in your car, boom box, iPhone, headphones etc. professionally mixed songs should sound good on most to all systems"
edmproduction,3d624d,jaypohlman,2,Tue Jul 14 01:20:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah mastering is not nearly as important as mixing. If you lack in mixing,mastering won't help.If you lack in mastering,a good mix will still sound fine."
edmproduction,3d624d,DrDuty,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:46:21 2015 UTC,Precisely!
edmproduction,3d624d,jaypohlman,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:33:19 2015 UTC,Usually you'll want to get a stellar mixdown on a couple of different references then send it to a mastering engineer who's job is to make sure it'll sound good on all mediums.
edmproduction,3d624d,mrballsack,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:25:52 2015 UTC,Oh right. So basically don't worry about the sound until you finished the planning kinda thing right?
edmproduction,3d624d,Ragnatronik,3,Mon Jul 13 20:27:24 2015 UTC,"Well, in electronic productions where you're working solely or mostly in the box, it's always helpful (and something most producers naturally do and don't really think about) to mix as you go while writing and arranging the song. Don't use a lot of time to mix because you'll do that later and you don't want to disrupt your workflow, but just quick little balances to keep the track inspiring to you and not a complete sonic mess. By the time you hit the mixing stage you'll have a easier time if it already sounds decent. Similar to what recording engineers do when they track live performances.   TL;DR Always care at least a little bit about the sound. The mastering engineer needs the best mix possible from you so he doesn't spend time making corrections and every correction he makes effects the entire song. There's a lot of things they can't or won't be willing to fix that were supposed to be done during mixdown. Bad mixes waste their time, your money, and great mixes allow the engineer to be more creative than surgical.   I hope this is relevant to what you were asking /u/MidniteDD. And good luck!"
edmproduction,3d624d,ScorpioServo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:04:32 2015 UTC,This is something I have been trying to figure out for a bit as well. It's a tricky subject.
edmproduction,3d624d,meldaproduction,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:48:27 2015 UTC,"As others said, the process is called mastering, and typically takes place after mixing.  My first tip is to have a good mix to start with. As the saying goes, you can't polish a turd ;)  The second tip is to compare against reference tracks that translate well and have a sound you are aiming for - after all, the human ear and brain are notorious for hearing fatigue and short acoustic memory!"
edmproduction,3d624d,markovskiii,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:59:34 2015 UTC,"that's mastering. but as a producer you start by checking any mono compatibility issues, the right amount of low end, proper levels. most people don't listen to their non-mastered tracks in several devices. but maybe we should."

Even when I buy albums of artists I love, there's typically a few songs that I don't thoroughly enjoy. If it sounds good, it is good. What may sound good to one person, may not to another."
edmproduction,3d7law,robert_stone,3,Tue Jul 14 17:28:59 2015 UTC,"People are generally on very high horses on this sub. Experimenting is of course a very good thing to do, but like any other craft copying and copy catting is going to teach you faster. Judging by your post you are just starting out so:  There are different ways to approach this, the most common one is adding a low pass on your bass during the buildup and also some volume automation to bring it in steady and then remove it somewhere along the buildup and bring it back in at desired volume and without the filtering.  Another approach is if you have split your bass in to multiple sounds on multiple channels (e.g. low / mid / high); here you can play around with either bringing in only the low or the mid, or both low and mid. I would try and keep out the high during everything but the drop in this case though. Bringing in some more tone to the bass is very effective during drops.   Also, I would like to add that bass is easily the hardest part about EDM, so if it sounds like shit just keep practicing and you will eventually nail it. Try and listen to your favourite artist and see how they've mixed the bass."
edmproduction,3d7law,arnonmusic,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:25:52 2015 UTC,You gotta make a mix between the expected and the unexpected thing in the track you know? Thats how it works with the bass

edmproduction,3d4qsc,jorsias,5,Mon Jul 13 14:46:17 2015 UTC,"You are overthinking it. Just do your track as you think it sounds good; any DJ that's not a whining 12 years old should be able to mix it no matter what. There are no excuses, with the quality of DJ tools these days  you can make almost any track mixable.  If you really feel like you must follow some arrangement rules, just copy the arrangement of a track you like in that subgenre (sit down with the track, a pen and paper and count bars to reverse engineer the arrangement)."

Then they suck. They should know the track has a different arrangement. Hell if a track has a unique arrangement ill make a point to use that unique part of it, not shy away from it. When I listen to a track I specifically think about how ill mix it, while ill listen.   But, I doubt anybody will make it a point to make a weird arrangement the norm. It will not harm you in any way to have some tracks with unique arrangements, it will just make you seem like a better musician."

If I choose to play tracks like those (2-3-4 minute long mixing parts), I know that I can maximize the effect of such an arrangement by mixing at the appropriate pace.   A simple example, this track, the hats and sound design make it great for unique transitions (as do many house tracks) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyYwDKMFVzI  Vocals and speech snippets are great too. I have a version of this track that is almost 15 minutes long that goes into an amazing existentialist speech at the end. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2pcNZE4ZT4  In general I consider most Romanian Minimal to have really unique arrangements that you have to look at on a case by case basis. (Petre Inspirescu, Ricardo Villalobos, Arpiar label, etc) This track has a pretty god dam weird arrangement (musically), pulling the emotional rug under your feet, toeing the line between rough and tender https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRHa-wutgh8"

Building up every 8 bars does indeed have a certain effect of growth that is very pleasant and works well with other tracks. Now what do you add every 8 bars? To answer that you have to understand the effect and why you are changing stuff. What type of effect are you trying to achieve by the change you want to do? What are people expecting? Can you play around with that expectation? You can chose to immediately change something, or to instead forgo a big change, at an important section, and both will have drastically different effects (one will imitiadly change the energy, the second will add anticipation.) Understanding the effects and using them is making music. If you are just following a format without thinking about the ACTUAL effect your music is having on people you are not really making music."

If you have the money i'd say go for it you also get some plugins.  If you are looking at it, you are probably looking at the Advance, and I think  KK>Advance all the way, you can of course get something of a good quality for a 3rd of the price. I think Komplete Kontrol is the best keyboard in the market, the only thing Advance has that Kk doesn't is 3rd party integration but that will be added soon (you can link parameters anyways). If you have KOMPLETE and you are looking at the high end (in quality), definitely go for it, if not, get it anyways and try to get KOMPLETE too. Maschine+Komplete+Kontrol is crazy. The keys are pretty nice. And to the great build quality we have to add that it looks much better than any other. It doesn't have pads, but personally, I don't decide a $600 keyboard depending on the pads, cause Advance's aren't great either."

I think getting the piano and when it arrives K10 is the best option, or try to contact NI and buy both at the same time but that they directly give you the discounted price, however NI's support is a bit shitty."

Without K10, the S49 becomes a pretty standard MIDI controller. At that point, you could probably look into other controllers for a slightly cheaper price. The integration with K10 is where the S49 shines."
