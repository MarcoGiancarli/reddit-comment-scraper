philosophy,3e2dqc,MaceWumpus,5,Tue Jul 21 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"if the ""watery stuff"" was composed of a different compound--then ""water is H2O"", spoken in the language of that world, would be necessarily false.   Forgive my utter ignorance of the scholarship here, but I do not see why anyone should waste his time puzzling over why ""The liquid that covers most of this world is H2O"" should have different truth values in the two worlds, because the two utterances mean different things.  The one refers to the liquid surface of one world, the other to that of the other."
philosophy,3e2dqc,Ernst_Mach,3,Tue Jul 21 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"There's a sense in which the two utterances absolutely do mean different things (as you say, they directly refer to different things according to worlds where the 'liquid that covers most of the world' is, e.g., XYZ instead of H20).  But there's also a sense in which we want to say that the utterance ""The liquid that covers most of this world is H20"" means the SAME thing, regardless of the world of evaluation.  This is precisely the ""2nd dimension"" of meaning the 2-D semanticist takes herself to be explaining.  The referring term ""The liquid that covers most of this world"", according to Frege's intuition, is associated with a certain sense, which in turn is associated with ""cognitive significance"", which a 2-dimensionalist like Chalmers would say composes an aspect of meaning.  Cognitively significant identity statements like 'a=b', e.g. 'Hesperus is Phosphorus', are cognitively significant because 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have different associated senses('the star seen in the evening' and 'the star seen in the morning', respectively), even though here at the actual world, they are co-referring terms, and so pick out the same object/substance in the actual world.  So the 2-D semanticist would agree with you that the utterances have different truth values according to different worlds, but would further add that there's a second dimension of meaning we miss if we limit ourselves to the traditional possible world semantics: namely, that our terms have a priori cognitive significance, and that further, this cognitive significance comprises our ""reference-fixing criteria"" across all possible worlds."

philosophy,3e2dqc,ModeOfPresentation,3,Tue Jul 21 16:22:17 2015 UTC,"It absolutely does!  If Chalmers' 2-D project is right, then we have apparently reforged the link between modality and reason thought to have been broken by Kripke's arguments for the necessary a posteriori/contingent a priori.  In effect, an epistemic 2-dimensionalist like Chalmers wants to say that truth conditions for a given statement is available to us a priori, and so conceivability is a direct guide to the full space of possibility.  This, as you mention, is crucial in his zombie argument, where conceivability is to imply metaphysical possibility.  -Comment edited to remove inappropriate use of ""modal profile""; thanks to MaceWumpus for pointing out my mistake."

In effect, an epistemic 2-dimensionalist like Chalmers wants to say that the full ""modal profile"" of a given object is available to us a priori, and so conceivability is a direct guide to the full space of possibility.   You may know more about this than I do at the moment (I'm much more comfortable with Stalnaker's way of presenting the issues), but it seems like Chalmers actually doesn't want to say that. The full modal profile of most objects (like water molecules, say) are going to depend on facts about the actual world; that is, it's going to involve secondary intensions. It's seems like Chalmers wants two claims:  (1) That primary conceivabilty implies primary possibility, so long as we have a canonical description of the object in question.  (2) That there are some objects (consciousness, for example) for which the primary intension is essential (?) to the object and so there's nothing that we could learn about the actual object that would constrain the possibilities involved. (But here I know much less about the subject because I really don't care about philosophy of mind that much.)"
philosophy,3e2dqc,omgpop,2,Tue Jul 21 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"No, you have it just right.  Rather than making reference to the ""modal profile"" of an object (which as you note would include secondary intensions), I should have made reference to the a priori access to truth conditions a 2-D semanticist like Chalmers would endorse.  It is this a priori access to truth conditions, not the modal profile, that entails that conceivability is a fool-proof guide to metaphysical possibility."

philosophy,3e2dqc,ModeOfPresentation,2,Tue Jul 21 17:22:13 2015 UTC,"Okay, I apologise in advance for the complete illiteracy I will no doubt exhibit on this topic, but let me try. This and the mind-body problem are pretty much my sole contacts with philosophy.   It seems to me that Chalmers just takes it as a basic fact that we have the concepts we have, prima facie concepts like 'watery stuff' and the like, irrespective of how we acquire them. I'm probably missing your point, but take when Chalmers says ""Water is XYZ"" is a priori possible when evaluated according to primary intensions - I think that's just what he means by the a priori, and it's quite innocent given the epistemic gloss. Like if you look at Constructing The World, the cosmoscope doesn't do anything useful unless you already have the concepts built in. Chalmers seems to be against the view that you can derive high level concepts straight out of logic or anything like that, and hey it's probably the case that our conception of logic is contingent on our evolutionary and cultural history - so you know, ergo the a priori doesn't exist, lol. Chalmers has a reply to Quine out and about and in CTW he seems to make some arguments that have strong bearing on foundational issues of apriority. But that is all way over my head - my rather naive thought is that if you're going to buy into the a priori at all, isn't Chalmers' way of doing it quite sensible? I take the epistemic gloss to mean something like ""Certain worlds are possible as far as we know."" Why not?  I have no doubt at all that I'm oversimplifying, but it's kinda cool for me that you brought this up because I've really been wanting to get into some of these foundational issues about metaphysics and rationalism/empiricism etc, so I wanted to throw my two cents in. Teach me some stuff plz :D"
philosophy,3e2dqc,burn_N_learn,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:17 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that Chalmers just takes it as a basic fact that we have the concepts we have, prima facie concepts like 'watery stuff' and the like, irrespective of how we acquire them.   It's true that he doesn't seem to particular concerned with how we acquire them. That's the metasemantic (or foundational semantics) question, and to my knowledge, Chalmers largely doesn't deal with it.   I'm probably missing your point, but take when Chalmers says ""Water is XYZ"" is a priori possible when evaluated according to primary intensions - I think that's just what he means by the a priori, and it's quite innocent given the epistemic gloss.   It can't be, given that he defines primary intensions in terms of a priority. What isn't innocent (as everyone agrees) is the language that we need in order to get these a priori claims off the ground: it needs to be composed entirely of ""canonical"" descriptions, which are not dependent (conceptually dependent maybe?) on the actual world. Now, a lot of this stuff is likely going to be addressed in the next book (the one that CTW is supposed to be a prelude to), but one way of understanding Stalnaker's claim is that we just can't have a language of this sort, because we cannot develop concepts that lack empirical foundation in the actual world in the way that Chalmers wants.    I take the epistemic gloss to mean something like ""Certain worlds are possible as far as we know.""   That's not really what he's aiming for: the epistemic gloss is mostly meant as a way of rebutting the Kripkean argument. Chalmers is quite clear that, for him, what we think is possible is what is possible. Or, conceivability entails possibility.   But that is all way over my head - my rather naive thought is that if you're going to buy into the a priori at all, isn't Chalmers' way of doing it quite sensible?   There's clearly something right about Chalmers' picture. There seems to be some connection between what we think is possible tout court and the a priori disciplines of mathematics and logic. If we put aside Quine's (partially justified and partially unjustified) reticence about modal logic, the Quinean might respond by saying something like: ""yes, but any application of those formalisms is going to rely on empirical assumptions/facts and pragmatic considerations of theory. You can develop the a priori tools all you want, any use of them will not be a priori."" Whether that's right is another question."
philosophy,3e2dqc,ModeOfPresentation,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:42:34 2015 UTC,"I'm interested in asking methodological questions about metaphysics: is it appropriate to infer from semantic truths to modal ones? As in, it seems like the crucial argument in both Kripke's and Stalnaker's approach to what is necessarily or possibly the case depends entirely upon a certain conception of meaning or reference.  In Kripke's case, his view on modality is entailed by his causal theory of reference. In Stalnaker's case,  his view on modality follows from something like semantic externalism -- that our meaning and reference supervenes on the (actual) external world.  Is there anything to doubt about this method of metaphysics simpliciter? Does the fact that their views depend upon theories of reference or meaning cast doubt on what is metaphysically the case, given the fact that there are other meta-semantic theories that seem just as attractive as Kripke's, Stalnaker's, or even others such as R.

philosophy,3dztqh,Ravenclaw1603,3,Mon Jul 20 21:31:04 2015 UTC,"I have a real problem with his position.  His argument presupposes that we can always refer to reality and verify against it.  This is also the problem I have with his new book about perception. In it he distinguishes between looking at a thing and having a visual experience of it on the one hand, and having exactly the same visual experience of the thing without being able to look at it.  The former he calls seeing, the latter he says is not seeing.  But in the former case he's assuming the reality.  But the interesting question, the one philosophy has struggled with, is if you start with a perception, how do you know what you are perceiving is real? You could build a machine and it could give you data, but again you are perceiving data.  The important question is that starting from a perception or from a claim and nothing else, is it even possible to verify that it is true or accurate?"
philosophy,3dztqh,zbufferz,2,Tue Jul 21 13:23:17 2015 UTC,"if you start with a perception, how do you know what you are perceiving is real?   I'm a novice when it comes to ontological realism, but I thought the basic line of reasoning is that realism is simply the most parsimonious explanation for intersubjective agreement. In other words, the simplest explanation for why the perceptions of different observers are consistent with one another is that there is an independent reality with which they are all interacting. Other explanations are possible, of course, but they are invariably more convoluted and therefore less convincing.   You could build a machine and it could give you data, but again you are perceiving data.   It might be worth pointing out that we are already machines, and our sensory equipment - eyes, ears, nose, etc - gives us data. Inorganic sensory equipment like microscopes and telescopes and cameras are quite literally just extensions of our senses.   The important question is that starting from a perception or from a claim and nothing else, is it even possible to verify that it is true or accurate?   It might just be me, but I'm not sure this really is an important question. Again, realism seems - to me at least - to simply be an obvious logical inference from the overwhelming strength of intersubjective consistency."
philosophy,3dztqh,bombula,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you, but it seems to me that the point of philosophical investigations of realism is precisely to critique ""the most parsimonious explanation for intersubjective agreement"".  Yes, there may be an independent reality with which we all interact.  But that reality does not necessarily have to match our perception of it.  We could all be separate brains in the same vat, as it were.  The reason I think that the question of verification is important is that there are many instances where we actually don't agree on the reality reflected in our common perceptions, and there are many other instances where motivated disagreement seems difficult to thwart.  For example, consider the climate change ""debate."" Because we cannot directly experience the climate (as opposed to the weather) we resort to instruments and models.  But all that is necessary to create disagreement about the truth of the climate is to hold up different models.  As you can imagine, a myriad of models can be built with the same data (assuming we agree on the error rate of the date, which they don't).  So the counterattacks quickly devolve to ""those other models are unnecessarily complex"" or ""those scientists are in the employ of oil companies"" neither of which is a satisfactory refutation.  But the assumption that gives rise to this problem is that the truth is reachable, and we just disagree about how to reach it.  IF we toss out this assumption and instead assume that the truth may not only be unreachable but also ""unapproachable"" (i.e. you don't actually get closer to it either), then the question very clearly and explicitly becomes one of risk management and cost benefit analysis, which as a political question, it should be.  Instead, we got trapped in an unwinnable debate over a scientific question.  Maybe the reason its unwinnable is not because this particular question is hard, but because the underlying assumption of reaching the truth is flawed.  Accepting the latter allows us to move forward on different terms."

""Being is the same for all beings.""  I don't know what this means.  If you mean ""existing"", then a table that exists and a frog that exists are both beings.  So I don't think you mean this.  If you mean living, consider that a human living and a mold living are not the same kind of living, and consider that we can slide down to diatoms and viruses that are arguably both living and not-living.

philosophy,3dztqh,pattch,0,Tue Jul 21 06:10:03 2015 UTC,"This is fairly easy.  You can choose between either a ""3 entity"" view of ""all things entire"" or a ""2 entity"" view of ""all things entire.""  In the 3 entity view, you have the domain of objects, the domain of truths, and the domain of stated truths.  In the 2 entity view, you have the domain of objects and the domain of stated truths.  In the above I have used truths unanchored, and stated truths (implying that someone has done the stating.)  You can say objective and subjective, respectively, if you want.  The second scenario, where you have the domain of objects and the domain of stated truths is very easy to understand.  The universe of objects exists as it does whether anyone makes a statement about it or not.  Stated truths are made in reference to this universe and generally speaking we derive these truths from, and check them against, this universe of objects.  The first scenario isn't necessarily senseless, but it adds something unnecessary.  What it adds is problematic, on top of being completely unneeded.  You have again the universe of objects, but somewhere... whether inside or outside of this universe of objects... you also have an exhaustive collection of every possible truth that could be applied to every object within the universe of objects.  This means that for every object you have infinitely many truths that exist to... either define or describe it, depending on who you ask.  Why?  There isn't a reason.  Because objectivity is important, apparently.  All stated truths are then simply a reference to one of these templates of truth that exist for any given object, or any set of objects, or set of set of objects.  In short, there are infinitely many truths applied on so many levels of abstraction that the number of truths that apply to the universe of objects is inconceivable large compared to the universe of objects itself, no matter how you restrict the domain of objects.  If none of this made any sense to you, it's because this idea is inherently convoluted and pointless.  It serves absolutely no purpose to posit an intermediary between the universe of objects and stated truths.  Nothing is gained by insisting these intermediaries exist, but our ideas of truth and knowledge are endlessly muddied by endeavoring to do so.  TL;DR:  Either our truths reference objects, or our truths reference absolute truths (that we can't know, or at least know that we know) that reference objects.  Why the intermediary step?  There is absolutely no reason.  There simply isn't one."

""The domain of 'unanchored' truths"" is the one that is placeless and unknowable.  We can look at all of the claims that are made, and conceive of them in a conceptual space that is only incidentally abstract (because we can't observe every claim in whatever form it is made, but we can observe an example of a claim and make inferences about all of the other claims that exist.)  We can't even conceive of the domain of unanchored, ""absolute"" truths, as they would dwarf the world of objects, and we can't even look at a single example of an unanchored truth.  It is silly beyond all words to think of things in this way. (The idea that there are ""truths"" running around in some abstraction, infinitely by infinitely.)

philosophy,3dy59m,Pelkhurst,2,Tue Jul 21 06:36:44 2015 UTC,"The author of the article states that even though Rust speaks of the sin of ripping a sould from nonexistence, he's using the he word 'soul' metaphorically.  This implies to me that a disbelief in any afterlife (or beforelife) is a necessary or common prerequisite to antinatalism. I don't remember great suffering before I was born. I don't remember anything.  Our understanding of the world may be incomplete, but plenty of people have made plenty of arguments about the nature of the world with the little we have. So, yeah, beforelife could be pain I can't remember, or it could be pleasure I can't remember. But it seems like making any moral judgement based on what it could or couldn't be is impossible to confirm as good or bad.  Anitnatalists are just people who believe life is an intrinsically worse experience than nothingness."
philosophy,3dy59m,j4x0l4n73rn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:43:09 2015 UTC,"That's my problem with the anti-natalist argument. It reifies morality outside of the source - humanity. Only by myopia can one see utilitarianism as some God over humanity -- values come from humans, not before them.  Valuations of good and bad depend on our interpretations and crumble under a thought experiment that would end humanity. How can Benatar bemoan the anti-natalist's association with nihilism when the view inherently leads to a nihilism? A nothing where there was humanity, where there were created values, where there was life.  That's not even to mention that simplistic view that suffering=bad and joy=good. Do you regret all your suffering? There are more sophisticated utilitarian viewpoints than this, but I've not seen them used in anti-natalist arguments. That's because they stand on shaky, reductionist ground -- even, in the case of Rust Cohle, solipsistic ground:  Tellingly, Benatar refers to ""the basic curse of consciousness."" Wait -- I thought it was only suffering within consciousness that was bad? But Rust's anti-natalism is born in a mistake: he thinks, like the solipsist, that his own extreme suffering is the suffering of all beings, ""the basic curse."" He already has made a decision about consciousness, and it's born wholly in his own experience. Discussions of broader human suffering are rationalizations made after the fact.  Consider Rust's redemption. When Marty comments on the overwhelming black of the night sky, Rust realizes that ""once, there was only dark."" Our consciousness is a something in that dark; we are stars in the void.  Benatar would have the stars extinguished because they burn."

philosophy,3dy59m,zbufferz,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:21:15 2015 UTC,"The anti-natalist argument proceeds as follows:  (1) The presence of pain is bad. (2) The presence of pleasure is good. (3) The absence of pain is good, even if that good is not enjoyed by anyone. (4) The absence of pleasure is not bad unless there is somebody for whom this absence is a deprivation.   Because of the asymmetry of 3 and 4, not bringing people into life has the benefit of 3 which is not ""cancelled out"" by 4.  So you can see the problem with the argument right away. What does it mean for both 3 and 4, which can be experienced simultaneously to be both good and not bad?    It suggests that there is some neutral value between good and bad, and where we assign that neutral determines the outcome of the argument.  If instead I agree with 1 and 2, but suggest that both 3 and 4 are neutral (i.e. ""not bad""), the anti-natalist argument fails."

I said I would not have the child, but that's only because in your hypothetical example, the child is definitely going to have only pain and no pleasure.  So regardless of how we allocate the ""absence of pain"" condition (either as ""good"" as Benatar does or as ""not bad"" as I suggest) it's still better than a lifetime of only pain.  But now consider a normal situation where the child will experience a lifetime of pain and pleasure and the absence of both.  Experiencing pain is bad ( -1 ), but experiencing pleasure is good (+1), so if we assume an equal amount of pleasure and pain, they cancel each other out.  But consider the vast majority of our lives when we are experiencing neither pleasure nor pain.  If you accept Benatar's assumption, then the absence of pleasure is simply 0, but the absence of pain is +1.  You maximize the absence of pain by never creating this child, so the antinatalist conclusion holds.  But if I flip this one relatively unfounded assumption, the conclusion falls apart.   If I simply call the absence of pain to be equal to the absence of pleasure (i.e. ""no pleasure"" = ""no pain"" = 0), then creating vs. not creating is morally neutral."

I said I would not have the child, but that's only because in your hypothetical example, the child is definitely going to have only pain and no pleasure.    So if we jerk the child off or do something pleasurable before we light it on fire, that somehow changes your mind? What kind and how much pleasure does one need to experience before the torture of being lit on fire is acceptable? I think Schopenhauer put it best when he said, ""Pleasure is never as pleasant as we expected it to be and pain is always more painful. The pain in the world always outweighs the pleasure. If you don't believe it, compare the respective feelings of two animals, one of which is eating the other.""   But if I flip this one relatively unfounded assumption, the conclusion falls apart. If I simply call the absence of pain to be equal to the absence of pleasure (i.e. ""no pleasure"" = ""no pain"" = 0), then creating vs. not creating is morally neutral.   The problem is simply calling something equal doesn't make it equal. Which is why I asked you the question I did, if you are willing to spare the child that is going to suffer, what is the logical reasoning behind that? If saving potential burning children holds more value than doing nothing (absence of pleasure is not bad w/o someone to be deprived of the pleasure), they are not equal, and you've already agreed with this by saying you wouldn't have the child that would suffer, no?"
philosophy,3dy59m,zbufferz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:10 2015 UTC,"There is no logical reasoning behind my decision to spare the child is not logical, its compassion, for lack of a better word.  But it isn't logic.  But your hypothetical was not that they might potentially burn, it was that they absolutely would burn if they were alive.  You've created a scenario in which the life to be would certainly experience pain and nothing else.  I'm not weighing it against anything because you took all of that off the table in the way you set it up.  If the hypothetical were different, then I would do nothing and let it live its life.  I realize that calling something equal doesn't make it equal.  That's my point.  If you accept the antinatalist paradigm, then you've already accepted that.  I don't accept it.  at all. I'm just illustrating where in their argument there is an arbitrary move (absence of pleasure is worse than absence of pain) that ends up presupposing the conclusion.  If you cahnge this one thing, then the conclusion collapses.  What's the point of citing Schopenauer?  On the one hand you want to be analytical, then you make an appeal to an authority.  He didn't put it best.  Which is the real fundamental problem with the entire enterprise at work here.  Pain and pleasure are subjective, and it is impossible for you to know objectively how much pain someone else is in.  What's the point of declaring pain or pleasure bad or good if you aren't going to qualify, because as you point out, it amounts to rendering equal things that are inherently unequal."

Why would you have compassion? You state, apparently, that you logically know that the absence of the horrific pain is the same as if the child simply continued to not exist. Why does the possibility of suffering (that you say is neutral) all of a sudden illicit a compassionate response when it is the same as the status quo of not existing at all? The compassion comes from your understanding of suffering, and also your understanding that it's not 0.   I don't accept it. at all.   I cannot accept a great many things, but one, if you didn't accept it your compassion is unjustified and illogical, secondly not accepting something does zero for your argument, and the argument at hand. I could say I don't accept many things in logic and say if I changed a premise it would be wrong, but I would have to illustrate it beyond saying, well, uh, I don't agree. Changing one of the premises in most if not all logical arguments can collapse it, so it's not saying much.   What's the point of citing Schopenauer? On the one hand you want to be analytical, then you make an appeal to an authority.   Wasn't an appeal, I think it's an apt and true statement.   Pain and pleasure are subjective, and it is impossible for you to know objectively how much pain someone else is in.   Subjective in what sense? What the causes are from person to person? Sure, but that doesn't make them any less an experience we all go through. Not to mention some suffering is not subjective at all, there is not a living thing with pain receptors that would enjoy being burned alive.   it is impossible for you to know objectively how much pain someone else is in   That's not the problem, we're talking about the needless selfish desire/act of bringing life into existence that will without a doubt suffer, simply because we can, when not doing so is best in all cases. It only becomes an issue the other way around if you've already given the life, then try to take it away. I figured you'd have understood this for going on an on about the asymmetry.   What's the point of declaring pain or pleasure bad or good if you aren't going to qualify, because as you point out, it amounts to rendering equal things that are inherently unequal.   I mean by definition pain is bad and pleasure is good, it's built into the words/feelings/sensations themselves. There is no reason to bring a suffering life into existence. There is no harm done by not bringing a life into existence, there is only harm once you've done so, so the smart thing to do is to abstain from playing. Quantifying it isn't even necessary."

It is true that life is filled with suffering, and some or even most live life with more suffering then pleasure, but that should not detract us from procreating. On the contrary that should encourage us to take action. We are here, we can either live our life's without purpose, kill ourselves, or at least have a goal even a dream in mind that we wish to achieve in our lifetime.   We have suffering because our mind is telling us that something is wrong, just like we have pain when we hurt ourselves, suffering is there to show us that we are thinking or living in a manner that is hurtful to us. The suffering from our world is caused by our inaction, ignorance and apathy. We have both the manpower and resources to create a just and fair world, yet we feel powerless as we see ourselves going against the whole world.   Yet what we failed to see, is that if the majority, like this theory is pointing out, is suffering than we are not alone, rather we all share the same sentiment making us connected in an emotional level. If this isn't what makes us human than I don't know what does, but I do know one thing, we should use our suffering as an indication that this world is connected beyond our understanding, and it's us as a race that needs to work together to rid of all the unnecessary suffering, or wallow in isolation while trying to understand why we must constantly suffer by coming with idiotic ideas that maybe we should not exist because this is a bad world."

(Or, if you prefer, ""poorly worded,"" intentionally or otherwise.)  The wording is, ""What is the probability that the coin came up heads?""  1/3ers think this is asking, ""What is the probability that you are being woken up and questioned as a result of the coin turning up heads?""  1/2ers think this is asking, ""What is the probability that, when the coin was tossed, it would come up heads?""  Both are incorrect1 interpretations of the original question because the original question is nonsensical. The thought experiment set up is designed to make people think you're trying to answer the 1/3 question, whereas the wording is so close (came vs come, basically) to the 1/2 question that many will try to answer that question.  TL;DR  1 I felt this was a bit unclear. I don't mean that anyone is wrong for reading the question one way or the other, but rather that a definitive 1/2 or 1/3 answer is not an answer to the original question, because the original question is poorly worded and arguably has no answer.  Edit: Many people have messaged me saying that the 1/3ers question is the one that was intended to be asked (and some other descriptions of the problem have worded it more like the 1/3ers question) and that, while the answer seems to be 1/3, the experiment may instead have been intended to spark discussion on the nature and value of probability. I'm no expert on this (I mainly do philosophy on the human mind, which is tangentially related to our understanding of probability) and there are tons of great ideas on it in the comments below me, so I encourage anyone with that position to check out some of the replies to this comment!"
philosophy,3dw7ua,likesleague,35,Mon Jul 20 03:27:13 2015 UTC,TL;DR The answer is 1/2 but you would only be correct 1/3 of the time.

philosophy,3dw7ua,NecroticFury,4,Mon Jul 20 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"would only be correct 1/3 of the time.   Only because you are being asked repeatedly for one event but not the other. The coin flip was 50/50. It's 50/50 for being in one chain or another.   As sleeping beauty, it's not my fault that one of the two possible outcomes forced you to ask me a 2 or a million times. That doesn't change the odds of being in that scenario in the first place."
philosophy,3dw7ua,OutOfStamina,7,Mon Jul 20 13:35:17 2015 UTC,"Another way to look at this is to instead break the test up across multiple subjects.  100 people sit in 100 isolated rooms.  I stand in the hall and flip a coin.  If it comes up ""tails"", I go in and tell a randomly-selected two of them the result.  If it comes up ""heads"", I go in and tell a randomly-selected one of them the result.  All subjects are aware of the test methodology.  After I walk into the room, but before I reveal the result of my coin toss, I ask each subject what the odds are that I flipped ""heads"".  The coin toss itself operated at 1/2, but the fact that I am asking them the question introduces bias, because I ask it twice as many times when the coin came up ""tails"".  The odds of the coin I just flipped being heads, based on the subject's knowledge, is actually 1/3.  Does that summarize it pretty cleanly?  I sort-of felt that adding amnesiacs and multiple days in the original question just muddied the water.  edit: typo and clarification"

My answer (or at least the answer that seems intuitive to me) to this question is 1/2.  Re-wording the same question slightly more clearly:  When you are woken up during the experiment, to what degree ought you believe that the outcome of the coin toss was heads?  Halfers say 1/2; thirders say 1/3.  While some halfers are halfers merely because they mistakenly interpret the question as ""What is the probability that, when the coin was tossed, it would come up heads?"" others (the genuine halfers) are answering the same question that the thirders are answering, but answering it as 1/2."
philosophy,3dw7ua,likesleague,7,Mon Jul 20 04:21:59 2015 UTC,"When you are woken up during the experiment, to what degree ought you believe that the outcome of the coin toss was heads?   I think that's 1/3 to most people.  Consider repeating the experiment over and over after itself, so that on the final wake up day of a trial (either Monday or Tuesday depending on whether it's heads or tails respectively) you put Beauty back to sleep and flip another coin. Obviously, long-term she will be woken up due to tails 2/3 of the time (because 1/2 of the time the coin will be tails, resulting in two wake ups, and 1/2 of the time the coin will be heads, resulting in one wake up). It happens to be the same for short term, since the only information that we know is that we are being woken up and that there are three scenarios (heads Monday, tails Monday, tails Tuesday).  Consider if it were a 3-sided coin that was heads/tails/tails, and if it was heads I would wake Beauty up on Monday, if it was tails1 I would wake her up on Monday, and if it was tails2 I would wake her up on Tuesday. In that case, it seems clear that there's a 1/3 chance of being woken up because of heads, since the coin has 3 sides. The difference between this and a heads/tails coin is that the two tails wake ups aren't independent of each other in the context of the whole experiment, since you have to be woken up twice. The probability is exactly the same, however, because of the information that Beauty knows; nothing about the day. For her waking up, tails Monday and tails Tuesday have no discernible difference and behave exactly as if there was a tails1 Monday and tails2 Tuesday, resulting in a 1/3 chance that she is being woken up thanks to a heads toss.  Edit: /u/Supperhero commented but deleted it. I won't post his comment but I typed up a response so here it is.  Two of the scenarios happen in sequence. It's incorrect to add probabilities (25% 25% etc.. I actually did that math for someone else as an analogy in a different comment) because of this. If you want, however, you can think of it like this; when one of the tails scenarios occurs (tails Monday, for instance) the other one is 100% guaranteed to also occur (tails Monday -> tails Tuesday, and if tails Tuesday occurs tails Monday must have also already occurred). Since each tails awakening is guaranteed to happen whenever the coin flips tails (50% chance) each tails awakening actually has a kind of 50% chance. That doesn't make sense, of course (150% chance total) but it gets the idea across I hope (100% out of 150% is 2/3 for tails).   The problem you're having is that we're not awakening Beauty based on coin flips. If we were, you'd be right that it would be 50/50, since with every coin flip we'd make a check on heads or tails, and of course that's 50/50. But instead we're deducing things about the coin flip(s) from awakenings. You're thinking about the problem like this:   Flip a coin and see what you get.  Wake Beauty once for heads, twice for tails.  The probability should be 1/2, since when I wake her up I'm either waking her up because of heads or waking her up because of tails.    That's not how it works. This is (slightly modified to get point across).    Flip some coins and make a list of all the awakenings, paired with what coin flip triggered that awakening.  Since a heads triggers one awakening, you expect that half the flips will yield one awakening (H).  Since a tails triggers two awakenings, you expect that half the flips will yield two awakenings (T) (T).  Over time your list will look something like this: (H) | (T) (T) | (H) | (T) (T) | (H) | (T) (T) ... Obviously it probably won't alternate perfectly, but that's for math's sake.    So now you have a list of the proportion of awakenings (which approaches the true probability as the list approaches infinite length) due to each coin flip result. Note that about 2/3 of the awakenings are due to tails and 1/3 due to heads, simply because each 50-50 coin toss that ends up tails triggers twice as many awakenings.    Beauty has no idea where she is in this awakening list. As it happens, in the original experiment, she's in one little block; either an isolated (H) or one of the (T)s in a (T) (T) block. When Beauty awakens, she is not ""picking a block"" to awaken in (since she doesn't know whether or not she's already been awakened or even if she'll be awakened again later, which is why the amnesia is important). She's picking a single awakening. There are twice as many (T) awakenings as (H) awakenings and thus there's a 1/3 chance that her awakening was caused by a heads and 2/3 that it was caused by a tails.    Summary: Tails triggers two awakenings that are 100% likely to occur on each 50% tails flip. In a sense they each have 50% chance of occurring and the heads awakening does too so tails total 100%/150% and heads 50%/150%. 1/2ers (on this wording of the question) are thinking about the problem as trials of coin flips (50-50) when it's actually trials of awakenings (1/3 heads, 2/3 tails)."
philosophy,3dw7ua,spfccmt42,3,Mon Jul 20 05:26:57 2015 UTC,"""ok beauty, what do you think is the probability that the coin came up heads""  from the video, it is always 1/2, believe it.  Either it is monday and you don't have to go back to sleep, or it isn't.  It isn't a mistaken interpretation, it is poor wording if it means something else aside from heads vs tails."
philosophy,3dw7ua,Jonathan_Livengood,20,Mon Jul 20 07:07:53 2015 UTC,"But it isn't a nonsensical question. At least, it isn't obviously nonsensical.  Suppose I flip a fair coin and hide it under a cup. I ask you, ""What is the probability that the coin came up heads?"" You might be tempted -- perhaps by some frequentist considerations about single-case probabilities -- to say that there is no probability to assign here. But if you are a personalist, you will ask what your (coherent) degrees of belief are that the coin came up heads.  If you don't rate your clairvoyant powers too highly, I expect you will assign a degree of belief equal to 1/2 that the coin came up heads. You might also assign a degree of belief equal to 1/2 that the coin is now heads and the same value to the proposition that the coin will be observed to be heads after removing the cup. Though you need not do so, if for example, you think I have a trick cup that manipulates the coin after the initial flip.  So, how would a personalist think about the question posed in the Sleeping Beauty problem? She would say, ""When the experimenter asks, 'What is the probability that the coin came up heads?' he is asking for my coherent degree of belief that the coin came up heads.""  I don't say that this makes solving the problem any easier. There are personalist arguments for the halfer and the thirder positions. What I do say is that the problem cannot be dismissed as easily as you suggest here. The question is perfectly sensible from a personalist perspective AND continues to generate puzzlement."
philosophy,3dw7ua,grass_cutter,62,Mon Jul 20 05:43:43 2015 UTC,"There are really two different questions being asked. The probability of the coin being heads is 50%. The likelihood the coin was heads given the fact that you were woken up is 33%. End of story.  It would be akin to the experimenter only visiting you at all, half the time, when the coin comes heads. His very visit, or the setup, is providing new information."
philosophy,3dw7ua,dasheea,6,Mon Jul 20 07:07:51 2015 UTC,"How is the experimenter visiting providing new information?  Genuinely curious.  Before the experiment, you know nothing new, so the coin being heads is 50%.  Once you're woken up and the experiment is standing next to your bed, you still have no new information - whether the coin was heads or tails, you would have woken up the same way.  You don't know what the coin flip was and you don't know if it's Monday or Tuesday.  You're just sitting up in your bed like a derp.  But even before the experiment happened (on Sunday, for example), you KNEW this was going to happen once you woke up, that you'd just be sitting there like a derp.  There's no new information gained since Sunday.  I feel like the 1/3 ""frequentist"" explanation fails here.  It feels like when you wake up, there are 3 possible states and you could be in any one of them with equal probability.  Kind of...  but not exactly because the 2 tail states (Monday and Tuesday) are completely linked together.    Imagine a huge tank, like an aquarium.  I divide it in half from a bird's eye view.  Then, I divide one of the halves into half again, so that one section is 1/2 the size of the whole tank, and then there are 2 sections that are each 1/4 the size of the whole tank.  I blindfold you and then throw you into the tank (the tank walls are colored and not transparent.  Now I tell you to take off your blindfold.  You look around and just see 4 walls around you (let's say you don't know the size of the original whole tank).  I ask you what's the probability that you're in the 1/2 section (heads) instead of one of the two 1/4 sections (tails).  You have no way to tell because you haven't gained any new information since before being thrown into the tank.  Before you were thrown in the tank, you would have said 50%.  But before you were thrown in, you knew that once you were thrown in and you took the blindfolds off, you would be looking at 4 walls surrounding you.  Now that you're in the tank with 4 walls around you, no new information has been gained.  The frequentist explanation can succeed here because we clearly see the tank being divided into half (and one section into quarters, and no section into thirds).  There's a 1/2 chance you're in one side of the tank and there's a 1/2 chance you're in the other side of the tank."
philosophy,3dw7ua,CILISI_SMITH,4,Mon Jul 20 20:07:56 2015 UTC,Nicely explained.  I hear the question in the latter context because it's being directed at Beauty for her to answer.
philosophy,3dw7ua,The_Yar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:53:38 2015 UTC,"The problem is that questions of probability, particularly these sorts, rely on assumptions about the knowledge and point of view of an observer. Then the Sleeping Beauty problem scrambles those assumptions, which essentially destroys the applicability of classic probability, or at least makes it less intuitive.  There is also the natural philosophical discrepancy between determinism and probability. If I flip a coin, it lands heads, and then I ask, ""what is the probability of it having landed heads?"" then one might struggle to answer. Is it 100%, knowing what we know, or does it still make sense to describe a 50% chance of it not being what it obviously is?"
philosophy,3dw7ua,grass_cutter,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:16:59 2015 UTC,"You anyway answered your question. Probability describes one's current knowledge of affairs, not necessarily reality.  When you shuffle a deck of cards it's quite likely you will assemble an order of cards never before existing in the universe. Hence you sign a 1/52 chance of any particular card being on top of the deck. But really, you physically moved each exact card into place. There was no randomness about it.  Flipping a coin, if you measured enough variables upon its initial launch you could probably assign a guaranteed result. Probability is our knowledge, nothing more."
philosophy,3dw7ua,likesleague,1 point,Mon Jul 20 06:51:29 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about personalism and I've only talked very briefly about degrees of belief, so I may be off in left field here.  I believe your interpretation of the original question would inherently effect your degree of belief that the coin came up heads.   If you interpret the question in the context of a general coin flip (i.e. what is your degree of belief that when I flipped the coin it would come up heads?) you'll say 1/2. If you interpret the question in the context of awakenings (i.e. what is your degree of belief that this question is being asked after the coin having turned up heads?) you'll answer 1/3. The former is obvious, and I can mathematically/computationally demonstrate the latter.  I don't believe this is a problem about how people interpret this specific question, and I don't think it's a problem about how one constructs belief. Of course you can argue those things, but they would probably be better discussed in a context directly constructed for thinking about them, rather than a question like this where there are mathematical gymnastics that can be done to basically avoid doing any philosophy."

Rather, the relevant question seems to be the reverse of that:   What is your degree of belief that the coin turned up heads after being asked this question?   And there does seem to be genuine disagreement between the halfer and thirder positions over this question, rather than the halfers interpreting this as ""What is the probability that, when the coin was tossed, it would come up heads?"""

No, I am thinking this is asking, ""What is the probability that the coin came up heads given that I was woken up?"" And the answer is still 1/2 because of math.  Let W be the event that she is woken up, and let H be the event that the coin is heads. Is the question asking P(H|W)? If so, you can apply Bayes' theorem, to get  P(H|W)=P(W|H)P(H)/P(W)  But P(W|H)=1 and P(W)=1."
philosophy,3dw7ua,junerd,5,Mon Jul 20 21:34:04 2015 UTC,"I agree completely. The question is a play on words.  1/2ers are talking about coin tosses regardless of an observer, and the 1/3ers are talking about observation caused belief.  To come up with a clarifying example imagine if instead of waking up more than once the tails outcome killed the sleeping beauty.  Pre-death the probability is 1/2. After having observed (i.e. still alive) the chance of heads is 100%.  The above trickery wouldn't work if the outcomes were so black and white. As OP said, the unclear wording and also imo adding the strangeness of waking up multiple times throws people off."
philosophy,3dw7ua,bullettbrain,2,Mon Jul 20 09:06:58 2015 UTC,"To me the problem sums up the gamblers fallacy very well. The coin will only ever have 50/50 chance of heads out tails. The actual outcome of the experiment as sleeping Beauty experiences it may be a 1/3 chance of waking up, but ultimately, every time the coin is flipped, there's a 1/2 chance it's heads, and flipping a tails first doesn't change that."
philosophy,3dw7ua,drukath,2,Mon Jul 20 13:23:29 2015 UTC,"The opposite is in fact true. You are right that every time a coin is flipped there is a 1/2 chance of it coming up heads, but this is only for future results. Once a coin has been tossed the result is no longer 1/2, but 100% whatever came up. To assume that a past result is still undetermined, or part of the 1/2 of all future tosses is exactly what the Gambler's fallacy is teaching us.  Anyone thinking the result could be 1/2 has not realised that past results are determined and no longer probabalistic."

I'd say both of your kind of sub comments are just extensions of the same question because you can interpret the question to mean both, not that the question itself is wrong.  edit: I preferred the discussion over at /r/math about a month ago"

Therefore your description of the 1/3ers interpretation is the correct interpretation, because asking what you say the 1/2er interpretation  would be silly. Everyone knows that a fair coin has a 1/2 probability of coming up heads, and there must be a point to the elaborate set up. And finally because it's an interesting question if assumed that it's    ""What is the probability that you are being woken up and questioned as a result of the coin turning up heads?"""
philosophy,3dw7ua,jabarr,2,Mon Jul 20 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"I think a good question to ask would be, if over the course of 10 trials, how often would saying ""tails"" be the correct answer? How often would saying heads be the correct answer?   Over 10 trials, a perfect outcome would be 5 for heads, and 10 for tails. If someone answered ""tails"" every single time, they would find themselves correct twice as often as they would by saying ""heads"". This is because for every event that ""tails"" is correct, there is a 100% chance that ""tails"" will be correct for the next event. Meanwhile, if ""heads"" is answered after every correct ""tails"" answer, then there is a 100% that they will be wrong. If two experiments are formed, each one having 10 trials, and in each one the person either answering ""heads"" for every answer, or ""tails"" for every answer, and the trial only progressing for as long as right answers are called (meaning that if they answer ""heads"" when ""tails"" is correct, then they will not be put asleep again to awake on tuesday, instead a new trial will begin with the ""initial"" coin toss), the person answering tails for every trial will find themselves in an experiment lasting twice as long as for the person who is answering heads for every experiment."

The question is not faulty. You're trying to create a word problem where there is none. The answer is 1/3 because every time the coin flips to tails, they ask her twice. It's pretty simple. The probability of the coin flipping to heads (this is not the question asked) is always 1/2 but the probability that the coin actually came up heads this time (this is the question) is 1/3 since they count every tails twice.

I don't see what ""that you are being woken up and questioned as a result of"" adds to precision. Nor what ""turning"" adds to ""came up"".   I see ""What is the probability that the coin came up heads?"" as a very precise question to ask sleeping beauty. It only makes sense to ask regarding one ""wake-up"", and adds no precision to add ""questioned"" to a question. It has a question mark in the end, it clearly is a question, and ""came"" clearly relates to one specific event in the past relating to a specific wake-up. The answer is 1/3 since tails gives two wake-ups.   In other words you may be correct in analyzing why 1/2ers misinterpret the question.

""What is the probability that [you were woken up because] the coin came up heads?"" is also a very clear question, and clearly 1/3. The reason ""you were woken up because"" is important is that the event that's happening is Beauty waking up. Asking about the probability that ""the coin came up heads"" in a context that isn't, by literal wording of the question, related to her awakening, is either nonsense (as I believe it technically is) or unrelated to the event (which yields the 1/2er interpretation)."

Eg. let's take a simpler scenario.  Every year, the king of a small kingdom performs the following ritual: he secretly tosses a fair coin.  If it is heads, he writes a summons for a randomly chosen duke, and, if that duke turns up, rewards him with 150 gold coins.  On the other hand, if the coin is tails, he randomly summons two dukes (with the same formal letter), and any that turn up are fined 100 gold coins.  The dukes are free to ignore the summons with no penalty if they want.  The dukes also don't have time to communicate etc before replying.  You are a duke of the king who has just received such a letter.  What is your credence that the king's coin landed heads?  Should you answer the summons?  I think it's much clearer that in this situation, the answer is not 50%.  If it were, attending would be a good idea, since you get a net return of 25 gold on average.  But in fact, it's a losing proposition - the king is the one who wins this game.  This is an example of us conditioning on who we are out of a class of possibilities.  The very fact of being a duke who is receiving a letter makes us more likely to be in the class of ""dukes who receive the letter in tails years"" than those of heads years.  So we conclude it's twice as likely the coin was heads.  Sleeping beauty differs in that the conditioned states are the same person, spread in time, but with their memory manipulated so that informationally, the situation is equivalent to the dukes case.  Should this make a difference?  What exactly about it changes things?   The probability of the original event i.e. the toss, is still one half   Is it though, given the information we have available to us?  That's not the case in the Duke's example, because we've received new information that lets us update our probability.  The sleeping beauty argument is that the same is true there - that the information is that of finding ourselves in such a situation alters the credence we should assgn, just as findng ourselves in the position of receiving a letter does for the duke."
philosophy,3dw7ua,CMAuGaming,38,Mon Jul 20 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"I am generally quite bad at grasping mathematical concepts here, so can someone please ELI5? Why isn't the probability of the coin being heads 1/2? Why does the number of awakenings in the tails outcome matter?   The question is, what is the probability of the fair coin coming up heads.  If the question was, what is the probability of Sleeping Beauty being woken up on a day where the coin came up heads, THEN I could understand why it is 1/3."
philosophy,3dw7ua,Brian,12,Mon Jul 20 07:10:24 2015 UTC,"what is the probability of the fair coin coming up heads.   No - it's ""What is the probability of the fair coin having come up heads, given that you've been woken up and asked this"".  Clearly, we can give different answers than 50% if we receive extra information after the fact. Eg.  suppose you toss a fair coin, and if it's heads, you roll a fair dice, and if it's tails, roll a trick dice that always comes up 6.  You show me what the die rolled.  It shows ""6"" - should  I still conclude it's 50:50 that the coin was tails?  The Sleeping Beauty paradox boils down to whether the fact that we find ourselves in this scenario provides us with such information.  The thirder argument is that it does, because it's a situation we find ourselves (indistinguishably) in twice as often when the coin came up heads, and so, on experiencing it, should consider it twice as likely such a scenario occurred."
philosophy,3dw7ua,Vicker3000,23,Mon Jul 20 02:12:54 2015 UTC,"what is the probability of the fair coin coming up heads   This question right here is the core of all the misconception and bickering.  This is not the question she is asked (or at least should be asked, if you're phrasing the ""problem"" correctly).  The question being asked instead should be:  What is the probability that the (already performed) coin toss came up heads?  Let's say I flip a coin, and then show you the outcome.  The outcome was heads.  I now ask you, ""what is the probability that that particular coin toss was heads?""  Your answer would be that you are 100% certain that that particular coin toss came up heads.  You're there looking at it.  You can see that it's heads.  You're doing something similar with Sleeping Beauty, but you're not showing her the coin afterwards.  Instead you're giving her information that gives her some information about the result of the coin toss, but not complete information.  We're asking about probabilities of an event that has already happened.  We're giving Sleeping Beauty limited information about that event that has already happened.  It is the information we're giving her that determines the probability.  Thus the probability of 1/3."

I'm not quite following you, because to me it seems like the only information SB has about the result of the toss is what she is able to glean from the rules of the game, which were explained to her prior to the toss. There is no information contained in the ""waking up and being asked"" phase of the game, unlike in your example where the result is shown.   This puts me in the 1/2 camp. Many thirders are saying ""put yourself in her shoes,"" but if I were her, my reasoning would go: ""Even though there are 3 possible realities I could be inhabiting right now, both of the 'tails' outcomes must necessarily be crammed into the 1/2 likelihood that the coin came up tails in the first place, so they each carry a 1/4 probability of having happened."""

There is no Tuesday.  Now when you wake her up on Monday, you ask her how she thinks the coin toss went.

I can get into the 1/2 result from the ""no additional information"" argument, though I would argue that the fact that you are waking up is that additional information. What I really do not understand, is by what logic you can distribute that 1/2 of coming up Tails over the events Tails-Monday and Tails-Tuesday. You do account for the double trial in the Tails case, but then you don't use this information in determining the probabilities of the coin flip given you are waking up! Really, I can understand why you would say 1/2 on the coin flip, but not the 1/4, 1/4. That does not make any sense. Can you explain?"

philosophy,3dw7ua,drukath,3,Mon Jul 20 05:41:29 2015 UTC,"The probability of a future coin toss occurring is still 1/2. Nobody is denying what that is.  The question, however, is ""what is the probability that the coin came up heads"". Now we are talking about a past event. As that event has occurred the probability that it occurred is 1. It happened, and there was no chance that it could unhappen.  So now we are not asking about a future probability but a past one. The event that occurred has a 100% chance of having occurred (and the experimenter, for example, will know the result). However Sleeping Beauty does not know the result, so she has to work it out.  Now say you were with the experimenter when the coin was tossed. The experimenter has seen the result but you have not seen it yet. This is going to sound a bit weird but given the situation you have no additional information so you know there is a 50% chance it will be 100% heads, and a 50% chance it will be a 100% tails. That gives you a 50/50. It is important to phrase it like that because the event has already happened so in reality it is not 50/50 it is definitely 100% something.  Sleeping Beauty, however, has more information. She knows that there are 2 times that she will be woken up with no prior memory that it is a tails, and 1 time it is a head. So at the moment she wakes up she knows it is 1/3 chance of 100% heads and 2/3 chance of 100% tails (remember the coin toss has happened so it is 100% something).  Therefore the correct answer to her is 1/3 * 1, or more simply 1/3."

But, putting myself in her shoes, I can see myself thinking ""well, there are three different universes here. The probability of being in one of them (IE the heads one) is one out of three. That's one third"".  At least that's my interpretation."

When she wakes up, there are two possible scenarios for the awakening that stem from the tails flip, and one that stems from the heads.   So the probability of it being heads is only 1/3."

The sum of all states must be 1    That seems to argue for the thirder position if all 3 are equally likely (and they will certainly occur with equal frequency in repeated experiments), since the only possible sum of 3 states that have equal probability and sum to 1 is 1/3 for each."

But the question of probabilty of the coin landing heads is still simply 1/2.  If the question to the sleeper was ""What do you think the coin landed on?"" then they would guess tails if they wanted a higher chance of being correct. But it still doesn't change the probability of the flipping of the coin. It all depends on the question being asked.

Every time the coin comes up heads, I text you a picture of the coin. Every time the coin comes up tails, I make a check-mark on a piece of paper, and whenever I've made ten check marks, I text you a picture of the coin. So in effect for every 10 text messages with a picture of the coin having come up heads, you also get 1 text message with a picture of the coin having come up tails. Of course, the messages aren't evenly spaced: sometimes you get 9 heads messages then a tails message, sometimes you get 6 heads then a tails, etc.  Now imagine someone else comes into the room and pulls a gun on you. They say ""I want you to predict whether the next message is going to have a picture of the coin showing heads or the coin showing tails. If you get it wrong I shoot you.""  One thing you could say is that ""well every time Tycho flips the coin, it's 50/50, so whatever message I get, that coin is a 50/50 heads/tails coin, so I'll just make a random guess.""  But that would be stupid. Surely you ought to guess heads. It's more likely that you'll get a message about a heads coin than a tails coin.  This illustrates the point at issue here: if you only know that a coin is being flipped, then you would just make a 50/50 guess. But if the results of a coin flip determine the information you get about the flip, then sometimes this can change what you will guess.  Obviously in the sleeping beauty case the rules are more convoluted than ""tell you about all the heads but only 1 in 10 of the tails."" But we could recreate the sleeping beauty rules with text messages. If we did so, I think you would see why it would make sense to guess (under penalty of death) something other than 50/50."

Approx five eighths of the coin flipping beauties would perish  Approx half the always said tails gals would not make it through this particularly cruel thought experiment.  So it depends if you''ve decided to be flippant before or after you've been woken up. Flippant before and you're right flippant waking up and you're wrong.  So.. if we imagine we have been abducted and didn't have this thought experiment explained to us before we are woken up to only then have it explained then the probabilities are different.   If we presume (which we can't really but oh well) that if we have been woken up once before we would've said heads or tails on a coin toss then there is a 3/4 chance that we are being woken up for the first time and a 1/4 chance we are being woken up for a second time. That means that if we say heads now there is a 3/8 chance we are right if we say heads and a 5/8 chance of being right if we say tails.   Now if we're sensible and think we would've figured this out if we had been woken up before then we can say the probability that on any previous decision we would've said tails is now very very close to 1 instead of 1/2 then the probability that this is the second waking up 1/3 instead of a quarter making the chance of heads being right 1/3.

But if for each tails I get 2 opportunities to guess, that gives more opportunity to be correct when guessing tails. I don't know if I'm doing this right, but using my 200 coin flip, that's 97 times that I got tails, but multiplying that by 2 because I get 2 guesses each tails, that's 194 opportunities to guess (plus the 103) is 297 opportunities to guess, out of which, I would be correct guessing tails ~ 2/3 of the time.

My math isn't rock solid, so please correct me if I did it wrong, but, unless the philosophical issue is ""how do you pose the question"" I'm still a little confused about where the relevance to philosophy comes in (now, after more clearly understanding how the answer to the question varies depending on semantics)."

If it is heads, SB is woken up on Monday, asked what she thinks the coin was, then put to sleep forever. If it is tails, SB is woken up on Monday, asked what she thinks the coin was, then put to sleep. We then give her some memory pill so that she is reset to the state she was in at the beginning of Monday. On Tuesday, we wake her up again, asked her what she thinks the coin was, then put her to sleep forever.   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty_problem for more.

philosophy,3dw7ua,Brian,3,Mon Jul 20 03:26:04 2015 UTC,"How is probability subjective   The issue is that it's contingent on mind-dependant facts: the information we have available.  The application of probability is objective, but it remains the case that, say, Alice could assign a 50% likeihood to something and Bob could assign a 10% likeihood to the same scenario, and we can't say either has made an incorrect statement, so long as they've done the maths right.  You may say we could say the one with more information is correct, or that they're both wrong, and the answer is 35%, because you know everything Alice and Bob know, and also know some other stuff.  However, this is problematic, because you'd also have to conclude that you are wrong too, because someone who knew all the information would assign a probability of either 0% or 100%, because they'd also know the truth of the matter.  But saying all probabilities except 0% and 100% are always wrong seems to diminish the usefulness of probability somewhat!  We could take a more frequentist tack, and talk exclusively about frequencies of populations instead, and forbid ourselves from ever saying something like ""The likelihood this fair die will roll a 6 is 1/6"", instead only saying ""If you roll a large number of fair dice, 1/6 will show 6""  But this seems rather limiting, and doesn't allow for a lot of what we use probability for.  Rather, we can talk meaningfully about probabilities if we instead view them as a relationship between what we know/believe and how likely we should consider something to be true, given those beliefs.  Alice has indeed assigned the correct probabilitiy from her perspective.  So have I, and so has Bob, despite these all being different, because those assignments are ultimately statements about our subjective perspectives.  ""Subective"" is maybe a bit misleading, since this certainly doesn't mean ""anything goes"".  Ie you can still be wrong, even given your beliefs (eg. you miscalculate the odds) - I've seen it referred to as ""subjectively objective"" before for this reason.  But the point is really, that when we're speaking of the probability of a single event, we're ultimately talking about the probability given certain beliefs / information."
philosophy,3dw7ua,itisike,8,Mon Jul 20 05:31:18 2015 UTC,"2:14:   A further intuition pump to make 1/3 feel even more like the right answer was proposed by philosopher Nick Bostrom. Basically, it asks you to imagine that in the tails world Sleeping Beauty is not woken up twice, she is woken up a million times in a row. In this scenario, if you imagine being woken up and being asked 'what is the chance that the coin came up heads?' it feels much more absurd to say 1/2 given that you know that out of all the awakenings only one out of a million and one are in the heads world.   For me this modified problem acted as an intuition pump for the halfer answer rather than the thirder answer. The thirder view would be that the probability that the coin came up heads is only 1/1,000,001. Yet I can't imagine myself being that surprised if it actually came out heads.  A further modification to make an even stronger intuition pump for the halfer position is as follows:  /u/WilliamKiely's Variant of the Sleeping Beauty Problem  Instead of a fair coin, imagine that a fair million-sided die is tossed. If it lands on 1-999,999 then Sleeping Beauty is only woken up on Monday (as in the heads scenario in the original problem). If it lands on 1,000,000 then Beauty is woken up a trillion (that is, a million million) times.  For this version of the problem:  The halfer position is that Beauty should believe that the probability that the million-sided die came up 1-999,999 is 999,999/1,000,000.  The thirder position is that Beauty should believe that the probability that the million-sided die came up 1-999,999 is only ~1/1,000,000 (Note: the exact probability would be 999,999/1,000,000,999,999).  Imagining myself in Beauty's position in this modified problem results in an even stronger intuition that the halfer answer is correct. I would expect it to come up 1-999,999 and would be quite surprised if I looked at the die and it said 1,000,000. (If it did say 1,000,000 I would be quite surprised one trillion awakenings in a row, but I don't think the fact that I'd be surprised a trillion times means that my credence that the die was not on 1,000,000 was too strong. Rather, I think that is just what happens when you keep erasing my memory.)  The thirders on the other hand must maintain that they would be quite surprised to look at the die and see any number below 1,000,000. I don't understand this intuition. All that would have had to happen was for the dice to be tossed the first night of the experiment and not land on 1,000,000.  EDIT: Typos."
philosophy,3dw7ua,itisike,4,Mon Jul 20 21:09:08 2015 UTC,"Intuition breaks down with such large numbers (see: Pascal's Mugging). Your brain can't represent 1000000 and rounds it down (see: scope insensitivity).  So while I share that particular intuition (and the related one in the Presumptuous Philosopher problem), I think it's a feature of those large numbers messing up our intuitions. (There's also the issue of uncertainty; if you're not completely sure of all aspects of the scenario, that can easily change the answer with these sized numbers, and while the problem is stated with surety, the brain ""knows"" that things are uncertain. To be explicit, your intuition refuses to assign a super-low probability to something that started out with a probability of 1/2, possibly in part because of uncertainty over whether any mistakes were made. If the probability of a mistake being made (or of SIA being wrong) is even 1/1000, that still makes for a far higher probability than your 1 in a trillion. So it's possible that you're doing a similar calculation subconsciously, and therefore rejecting something because of intuition despite the intuition not really applying.)"
philosophy,3dw7ua,drukath,2,Mon Jul 20 07:49:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, great post. I am now a thirder despite still intuitively feeling that the coin is highly likely to have landed on heads when imagining myself waking up in Beauty's position in my version of the problem. The numbers are so large that I would probably be incredibly old upon waking up making it more difficult to imagine and make my intuitions less accurate. If I magically found myself in the position I think I could now persuade myself to expect it to come up tails, despite the fact that my initial intuitive react was that it was highly likely to have come up heads, due to the fact that I now feel I have a very good understanding of the logic behind the thirder answer and believe it is correct."

philosophy,3dw7ua,Mixlop2,6,Mon Jul 20 21:51:31 2015 UTC,"If Sleeping Beauty is asked ""What is the possibility of the coin coming up heads?"", the correct answer is 50/50.  If instead, Sleeping Beauty is told ""Let's wager a dollar on whether the coin is heads or tails, which do you want?"", the correct answer is ""tails"".  Not because tails comes up more often than heads, but because when it does, she wins two dollars, once for each day she is woken up."
philosophy,3dw7ua,TheCountMC,3,Mon Jul 20 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"The answer is 1/3rd for Sleeping Beauty, and this is because future probability and past probability is not the same. The question in the video is ""What do you think is the probability that the coin came up heads?"". This is a past tense question for a specific event that has occurred.  Let's try something similar. Let's say that I told you I was going to toss a fair coin, and if it came up heads I'd punch you in the face, and if it came up tails I'd give you $100. I toss the coin in secret and then give you $100. What is the probability that the coin came up heads? Well forgoing that I am a dirty liar you'd say that the coin came up tails, so it was 0% heads.  Note that I am not asking you what the next coin toss will be, but what a past coin toss was. New information is introduced because the result of the coin toss determines the next action that can reveal it.  Another more obvious one is also possible. Let's say I tossed a coin in front of you and it came up heads. Now I ask ""What is the result of that coin toss?"" You'd not say it was 50/50 because the event has occurred and you can see it.  In the Sleeping Beauty Problem the chance that the coin will come up heads before it is thrown is indeed 1/2. But the question to Sleeping Beauty is not that, it is what was the probability that it came up heads. Given that there is only 1 situation for heads that she would have woken up with no intervening memory, and 2 situations for tails then the answer is 1/3rd. Because we're not really asking what the probability of the coin toss is, but the probability of which of the 3 situations you have been woken up in."

philosophy,3dw7ua,HeyKidsFreeCandy,3,Mon Jul 20 06:21:28 2015 UTC,"It always amazes when this ""problem"" is brought up, how much discussion and disagreement results.  Probability is mathematically defined and well understood, but no one ever bothers trying to define a probability space with outcomes, events and corresponding probability measure.   This has been discussed on reddit before:   https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/3915xh/the_sleeping_beauty_problem/  https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/39bl2g/about_the_sleeping_beauty_problem/  Even in the r/math, few people bring up the mathematical definition of probability.  Everyone wants to rely on their intuition about probability in a situation their intuition is not familiar with.  Shameless self-post-promotion  tl;dr - There are two ways to define a probability space consistent with the experiments.  One of them (the one with three outcomes) has the caveat that single experiments are sometimes not possible which makes the two outcome 50/50 space better, IMHO."
philosophy,3dw7ua,microli,3,Mon Jul 20 07:57:57 2015 UTC,"Okay.  I'm a mathematician who studies probability and statistics so here are my two cents.  We never make it explicit when sleeping beauty will be questioned.  However, assuming that she is questioned every time she is woken up, we have a classic sampling bias.  The correct answer would be 1/3.  This can be shown in both a frequentist or bayesian approach, but in this case a frequentist approach will serve since the approach is repeatable.  If the coin comes up tails, once, we know the next time she is questioned it will also be tails.  Thus if we were to repeat this experiment indefinitely and construct a series of observations by sleeping beauty, all of the tails would be ""repeated"" because they are dependent on the previous value. So it might look something like this:  HTTHHTTHTTTTHTTHHHTT   That's because the coin isn't being flipped again if sleeping beauty wakes up to tails and then goes back to sleep.   If we were to repeat this process indefinitely, it would also be a good example of a hidden markov chain.  Imagine that there are 3 states:   H1 to signify heads on the first waking T1 to signify tails on the first waking T2 to signify tails on the second waking   This begets the simple transition and emission matrices:     H1  T1  T2     H T  H1 0.5 0.5 0   H1 1 0 T1 0   0   1   T1 0 1 T2 0.5 0.5 0   T2 0 1   From there a traditional analysis will yield the 1/3 answer.  The fallacy with the 1/2 answer is that although the coin is indeed unbiased, sampling tails is twice as likely.  Thus , even though the flip is unbiased, the observation is.  So while it's true that you're not waking up with any more information, the experimental setup should be all you need to begin with.  I didn't know this was a ""bitter"" debate among anyone, but anyone who is getting bitter about it should go back and study probability some more.  It's a non-problem."

philosophy,3dw7ua,spfccmt42,3,Mon Jul 20 18:07:20 2015 UTC,"In his book Anthropic Bias, Nick Bostrom writes:   Synthesis of the 1/2- and the 1/3-views  The account presented here shows how we can accommodate both of the rivaling intuitions about what Beauty’s credence should be when she wakes up.  On the one hand, the intuition that her credence of Heads should be 1/3 because that would match the long-run frequency of heads among her awakenings is vindicated if we assume that there is an actual series of experiments resulting in an actual long-run frequency. For there are then many observer-moments that are outside the particular run of the experiment that ß2 is in whilst nonetheless being in ß2’s reference class. This leads, as we saw, to Pß2, 4, 6(Heads|e2) ˜ 1/3.  On the other hand, the intuition that Beauty’s credence of Heads should be [1/2] is justified in cases where there is only one run of the experiment and there are no other observer-moments in the awakened Beauty’s reference class [other] than her other possible awakenings in that experiment. For in that case, the awakened Beauty does not get any relevant information from finding that she has been awakened, and she therefore retains the prior credence of 1/2.   This appears wrong to me. What if there is an ""actual series of experiments"" that is only one experiment long? Would Bostrom then say that the probability is 1/3 (as the second quoted paragraph would suggest) or 1/2 (as the third quoted paragraph would suggest)?  I don't understand why Bostrom thinks the answer is 1/2 or 1/3 depending on whether the experiment is performed once or many times in series. That just seems wrong to me. Am I misunderstanding Bostrom's position?"
philosophy,3dw7ua,drukath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:48:13 2015 UTC,"What matters is the rules for how many times the experimenter will ask the question. Suppose that sleeping beauty decides to always answer tails. If the experimenter asks the question everytime he wakes her up, then she gets the question right 2/3 of the time because there are 2 trials everytime there is a tails and only one trial everytime there's a heads. But if the experimenter only asks the question once per coin flip, then the extra trial for tails goes away and we're back to 1/2 probability.   What's even more interesting is that the probability can also be between these numbers if it's not set beforehand whether one or the other method is used for the experiment. If sleeping beauty is not told how the experiment is run, she would have to assume equal probability for both methods, in which case the probability for tails being right is the average of the two above probabilities (1/2 + 2/3)/2 = 7/12."

philosophy,3dw7ua,chcampb,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:10:29 2015 UTC,"The probability that the coin came up heads is 100% what actually happened. You cannot apply future probabilities to past events. Past events happened with 100% probability, because they actually happened.  The question is trying to ask you to deduce what this 100% was based on the information that you have. Once the coin is tossed it is fixed. What is 1/2 before the coin toss is 1/3 after the coin toss to SB given the information she had. For example to the experimenter the result is neither 1/2 or 1/3, but 100% what actually happened."

philosophy,3dw7ua,chcampb,2,Mon Jul 20 02:56:13 2015 UTC,"So, thinking about it, it's only a problem because they are conflating the events.  The probability of the coin being heads per sequence is 1/2. The probability of the coin being heads per wakeup is 1/3. In this case, the event being measured is the coin flip, which exists only at the beginning of the sequence.   To say that there is a disagreement as to what the ""probability of the coin being heads is"" is really to say that there is a disagreement as to whether to frame the problem as being per sequence or per sub-event within the sequence.   Obviously, I could give any ratio of sub-events and change the probability to my liking if you allowed someone to choose the ""per sub-event"" method. So, I am not convinced that this is the correct way to approach the problem.

When she's woken up, she knows it's tails.  It has to be.

The question is asking the person being woken up, ""what is the probability that tails was flipped?""  Tails has a 50/50 chance of showing up. What happens after that is not the probability of the coin flip, but the state distribution which allows you to infer the result of the 50/50 coin flip. That is all."

But in the context of her observation, she should bet her money on Heads only if they offer 3:1 odds payout.  Otherwise it's a loss trend.  Factually speaking, after playing this game 1000x over, she'd lose everything over time if she bet on Heads with even odds.  She should always bet on Tails.  It's because Tails will be observed twice, as a rule.  Observer bias.  The original flip is 50/50, yes.

But if you ask them ""What is the probability that you are in a state having resulted from a tails roll?"" (question B) then you can respond 1/3 and be correct.   You might say that it's a paradox but it's not, really. People are just asking the wrong questions.

If she consistently places $1 bets on Tails 150 times,  she will have won 100 times and lost 50 times, for a net win of $50.  One could also say ""I am going to flip a coin, if it is Heads I won't do anything.  If it is Tails, I will ask you what chance you think the flip is Tails.""  When asked, you should answer ""It's Tails.  100% chance.  Final answer, it's Tails.  Every time you ask me.""  You do not need to see him flip and fail to contact you.  If those are the rules, it's 100% chance to be Tails when contacted because the result has been cherry-picked by the rule.  So the next question: would a bookie give her 50/50 odds?  How is it the bookie lose $50?  He wouldn't- well, he shouldn't.  Although she does not KNOW for certain that the coin is Tails, she's going to bet twice only if it's Tails.  From the bookie's perspective, the first night is ""fair"", 50/50.  Allowing her to wake up a second night and bet again only if it's Tails is bullshit for the bookie.    One might as well ask a casino ""if the roulette wheel gives me Black, I would like to automatically place a second bet of the same color and dollar value, which, full disclosure, I'm gonna bet on Black from the start every time!""  The casino would say ""no, you've broken the rules at that point.  You get to have 2 winning bets if it is Black, and only one loss if it's Red?

The reasoning behind the 1/3 answers has been already explained, they are 3 scenarios in which i'm awake and then interrogated, in which only one the result was Heads, therefore the probability is 1/3.  In an observational scenario  this even seems logical. If we take 100 sleeping beauties. and do the experiment. Therically 50 will have Heads and be awakened on Monday, for the remaining 50 that has Tails they will be awakened on Monday and on Tuesday, having 100 awakenings. In total we have 100 sleeping beauties but 150 awekenings. Among these 150 awakenings, 50 come from a Heads results. Therefore the probabilty for an Awakening( and not a Sleeping beauty) to come from a Heads result is : 50/150 = 1/3.  From the actual perspective of a sleeping beauty, which we could consider more relevant. We have to work on a Bayesian scenario and calculate conditional probability of  : ""the result of the throw being Heads, knowing that we are awake.""       Probabilty of tails  :  p(t)= 0.5 Probability of Head : p(h)= 0.5 Probabilty of being awake when interrogated: p(Aw)  Probability of being dreaming when interrogated: p(Dm) = 0 (lets admit it is null) p(Aw)+p(Dm) = 1 so p(Aw) = 1 Probability of being awakened on Monday : p(AwM) Probability of being awakened on Tuesday : p(AwT) p(AwM)+P(AwT) = p(Aw)    What we need to find is the conditional probability of  : ""the result of the throw being Heads, knowing that we are awake."" To be noted as p(h/Aw)    The probability of being awakened on monday p(AwM) corresponds to the sum of the probabilities of (being awakened on Monday and having tails ) and (being awakened on Monday and having heads), as p(t) and p(h) are complementary.      p(awM)= p (awM n t) + p (awM  n h) p(awM) = p(h) x p(awM/h) + p (t) x p(awM/t)    However p(awM/h) = 1 as it is obligatory to be awakened on monday if knowing the result was heads  p(awM/t) = p (awT/t) = 0.5 , as when you have tails you are either awoke on monday or tuesday , and as far as we know it is equally probable to be on either scenario, and there is no way of differenciate them     Numerically p(awM) = 0.5 x 1 + 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.75     For AwT P(awT) = p(awT n h) + p (awT n t) P(awT) = p(h) x p(awT/h) + p (t) x p(awT/t)    However p(awT/h) = 0 as it is impossible to be awakened on tuesday if knowing the result was heads p(awM/t) = p (awT/t) = 0.5 , as when you have tails you are either awokne on monday or tuesday , and as far as we know it is equally probable to be on either scenario, and there is no way to differenciate them.     Numerically p(awT) = 0 x 1 + 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25     Finally p(h n aw) = p(aw) x p(h/aw) as p(aw) = 1 p(h/aw) = p(h n aw)     = p( h n awM ) + p (h n awT)     = p(h/awM) x p (awM) + p (h/awT) x p(awT)     ( if you are awakened on monday the prob of the result being heads is 0.5)     ( if you are awakened on tuesday the prob of the result being heads is 0 )         = 0.5 X  0.75 + 0 x 0.25         = 0.375 + 0 = 0.375 = 3/8 So there you go,  the probability of the result being heads knowing that you are awake is 3/8"
philosophy,3dw7ua,PM_ME_KIND_THOUGHTS,10,Mon Jul 20 14:21:01 2015 UTC,It's 1/2.  The odds of a coin flip are always 1/2.  Because Math.
philosophy,3dw7ua,likesleague,8,Mon Jul 20 22:04:52 2015 UTC,"It's true that the unconditional probability of heads on the coin flip is 1/2, since the coin is fair. But the problem before us is to say something about the conditional probability. And the conditional probability might or might not be 1/2.  Suppose we have two coins and both of them are fair. If I tell you that one of the coins came up heads, then the probability that the other came up heads is 1/2. So far so good.  But now, suppose that we have a system such that if both coins come up heads, a bell rings. Suppose we observe one of the coins to be heads, but the bell does not ring. What probability should we assign to the other coin being heads? Seems that the conditional probability of heads is 0, not 1/2.  The question in the Sleeping Beauty problem is whether or not Beauty has information -- coming from knowing the set-up of the experiment and knowing that she has been awakened -- that makes the conditional probability that the coin is heads in her specific circumstances different from the unconditional probability.  EDIT: If you are tempted, like sexahol, to think that there is no reason aside from ""semantic masturbation"" (which is eponysterical), then I would very much like to gamble with you. ;)"

That's what you are saying here.   Sleeping beauty has circumstantial evidence that leads her to believe that she should NOT weigh the odds as a simple 50/50."
philosophy,3dw7ua,likesleague,29,Tue Jul 21 15:18:35 2015 UTC,"Nope. Sleeping Beauty has incredible universal evidence (i.e. fair coin) that the odds are exactly 50/50.   When the coin is heads (50% chance) Beauty wakes up once. When the coin is tails (50% chance) Beauty wakes up twice. The result of the coin ""causes"" the number of wake ups. It is not true in reverse. The wake up does not ""cause"" the result of the coin. If Beauty were to use such logic (i.e.: I've woken up, what does this tell me?) she would have to remember that though a tails causes two wake ups, it causes a single chain of wake ups. The wake ups are not independent of each other, and you do not add their probabilities. If you tried to think of it as adding probabilities (which is technically incorrect, but if you slightly altered the problem to include Beauty guessing what day she woke up on, and whether it was heads or tails, then you could consider each wake up effectively independent) then you'd say that p(heads and monday) = 50% (because there's a 50% chance of heads and a 100% chance of waking up on monday if heads is tossed) and p(tails and monday) = 25% (because there's a 50% chance of tails and a 50% chance that when she wakes up on a tails flip it's on monday) and p(tails and tuesday) = 25% (same reason as p(tails and monday)). Point is; if you're going to add probabilities based off of waking up, you need to remember that each wake up considered individually is weighted. The heads wake up is 50% and the others are 25%."
philosophy,3dw7ua,kiradotee,7,Mon Jul 20 01:38:23 2015 UTC,"you are looking at it wrong though, I think.  If you are sleeping beauty and you wake up, 2/3 of the time you will be on a tails wake up. Sleeping beauty has no way of knowing if she is in a chain of wake-ups caused by a tails flip or not, so she can't just include that in her ""in the moment"" calculations. every single wake up is its own thing.  If she is straight up asked to guess if the coin was heads or tails, in a practical sense she should assign a probability of 2/3 to a tails outcome in order to make a better educated guess.  probability is only useful because it helps us predict things. As I said in another comment, if your ""correct"" answer does not help sleeping beauty and mine can, then how can you call yours correct?"
philosophy,3dw7ua,EreTheWorldCrumbles,16,Mon Jul 20 02:25:22 2015 UTC,"She is asked the question, ""What do you think is the probability that the coin came up heads?""  If we're going to really understand the disagreement between 1/2ers and 1/3ers, we have to understand that the question is nonsense.   probability is only useful because it helps us predict things   Perhaps not to ""help us"" but yes, probability predicts things. You don't use probability to determine past events, you use probabilistic reasoning. If I drink a can of soda on 50% of days and I ask you what's the probability that I drank a can of soda today, you'd say 50%. That's the right answer to the slightly-rephrased Beauty question ""when/before the coin was tossed, what was the probability that it would come up heads?""   However, if I have a soda can in my head, you can use the relevant information to guess that I 100% had a soda today. However this does not mean that the probability that I would have had a soda today is anything different than 50%. Saying, ""seeing as you're drinking a soda, the probability that you had a soda today is 100%"" is backwards logic. I can use the fact that I drink soda 50% of days to create a probability (50% in this case) that I'll observe myself drinking soda on any given day, but I cannot use the information that I am drinking a soda to determine the probability that I drink soda on any given day. Such logic is basically the math equivalent of a post-hoc fallacy in an argument.  To summarize:  If Beauty was asked the question ""[given that you know you have woken up] how likely is it that this wake up is a result of the coin coming up heads?"" then 1/3 would be the obvious answer.  If Beauty was asked the question, ""what is the probability, upon being tossed, that the coin would have come up heads?"" then 1/2 would be the obvious answer.  The question, ""What is the probability that the coin came up heads"" is, in the context of the wake ups, misleading, nonsense, and very vague."

But I'm not so sure of that.)  Sleeping Beauty may find herself thinking, ""It could be any of the three possible situations that I am waking up to.""

Heads, she gets woken once on monday. Tails, she is woken a thousand times, being amnesic to all the other awakenings.

To say that there are three possibilities and therefore 33% chance of each is the same as saying that this lotto ticket will either win or lose, so it's 50/50.  Waking on Monday after heads and waking Tuesday after tails are not equally likely. There is only a 50% chance that it is possible for her to wake on Tuesday.  What would change it for me is if the experiment were to be performed many times, and she knew ahead of time that she would be asked every time she woke up whether it had been heads or tails. She would have a reasonable expectation that over time the total number of times waking up after tails would be double the total number of times waking up after heads, therefore she would maximize her correctness by always guessing that it had been tails. But that is not the problem as presented. As I describe the problem, tails has an advantage because she frequently gets two points for a single flip if she always guesses tails. As the video describes the problem, there is no bonus for the multiple opportunities to wake up after tails."

If tails, I pick a random number from 1-100 with a rng, and for all numbers except 100, I kill her in her sleep. If I picked 100, I wake her up. You are SB, you wake up. Does your ""math"" say that the probability of heads was equal to tails? This is pretty much the negative version of the problem.

philosophy,3dw7ua,The_Yar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:56:42 2015 UTC,"Imagine that you are in a room and I am in another room, flipping a coin over and over. Every time the coin comes up heads, I text you a picture of the coin. Every time the coin comes up tails, I make a check-mark on a piece of paper, and whenever I've made ten check marks, I text you a picture of the coin. So in effect for every 10 text messages with a picture of the coin having come up heads, you also get 1 text message with a picture of the coin having come up tails. Of course, the messages aren't evenly spaced: sometimes you get 9 heads messages then a tails message, sometimes you get 6 heads then a tails, etc.  Now imagine someone else comes into the room and pulls a gun on you. They say ""I want you to predict whether the next message is going to have a picture of the coin showing heads or the coin showing tails. If you get it wrong I shoot you.""  One thing you could say is that ""well every time Tycho flips the coin, it's 50/50, so whatever message I get, that coin is a 50/50 heads/tails coin, so I'll just make a random guess. Because Math.""  But that would be stupid. Surely you ought to guess heads. It's more likely that you'll get a message about a heads coin than a tails coin.  This illustrates the point at issue here: if you only know that a coin is being flipped, then you would just make a 50/50 guess. But if the results of a coin flip determine the information you get about the flip, then sometimes this can change what you will guess.  Obviously in the sleeping beauty case the rules are more convoluted than ""tell you about all the heads but only 1 in 10 of the tails."" But we could recreate the sleeping beauty rules with text messages. If we did so, I think you would see why it would make sense to guess (under penalty of death) something other than 50/50."

The problem is that the scenario under consideration does not satisfy the axioms of probability. There are three events taking place: waking up from heads (W1) , waking up from tails the first time (W2), waking up from tails the second time (W3). However, the sample space is only one element big: heads. There are only two possible subsets of the sample space: heads or its exclusion, not-heads (corresponding to tails). There is a many-to-one relationship between the events measured and the sample space (If you want to get deep into mathematical jargon, technically, we should say it is a many-to-one relationship between the events and the power set, sometimes called the omega set, i.e. the set of all subsets of a space). In other words, the events being observed cannot be measured with given sample space, because there is no way to uniquely specify events with a degenerate sample space.  From my undergraduate level probability textbooks: ""Let S be the sample space of a random phenomenon. Suppose to each event A of S (A being a subset of S), a number denoted by P(A) is associated with A. If P satisfies the following axioms...yadda yadda yadda...""  The problem here is the events A {W1, W2, W3} are not a subset (or a function of the subsets) of the sample space S {H}. Therefore, probability cannot say anything about this problem. In order for a calculus like probability theory to be satisfied, the problem must first meet the conditions of probability-theory.  Consider the abstract system, 1. there exist exactly three distinct Fe's in this system. 2. Any two distinct Fe's belong to exactly one Fo. 3. Not all Fe's belong to the same Fo. 4. Any two distinct Fo's contain at least one Fe that belongs to the both.   This system of assumptions prescribes a theorem-structure. For instance, it can easily be shown: ""Two distinct Fo's contain exactly one Fe."" or ""There are exactly three Fe's.""  Any problem that meets these assumptions will, by necessity of its form, have these theorems as a result. For instance, if we interpret Fe's as people and Fo's as committees, it makes perfect sense and thus the theorems are valid. If, however, Fe's are taken to be as, say, books and Fo's are taken to be shelves, the assumptions are not met and theorems of the system do not apply.  Analogously, people are trying to apply the theorems of probability to this problem, when this problem cannot be analyzed with probability without more information. There is no 'probability' associated with the event of waking up, since there are three states of waking up which cannot be measured in binary terms.  ... ... ...

philosophy,3dw7ua,WoodyTwigs,2,Mon Jul 20 12:50:55 2015 UTC,"You say it is not a mathematical problem then invoke the term 'credence' as if it is meant to imply anything other than 'probability'. You even go so far to say this credence is 1/3. How is one to intrepret a 'credence' of 1/3? What you mean is probability. And there is no probability that can be assigned to her state, for the aforementioned reasons. What would that '1/3' even mean? You would be saying there is a 1 in 3 chance she is in some state, but this says nothing at all about the coin being heads or tails.   In effect, her state fails the 'vertical line test', if you recall that from algebra or pre-cal. Her state has no functional dependence upon the coin. You are tricked into thinking it does because there is a causal connection. If you wanted to treat this problem with probability, you would have to assume there is no difference in the two states produced by tails. This goes against our intuition since there is a causal, temporal connection between the two events. However, probability theory cannot deal with violation of its assumptions. This reduncancy with respect to tails and her state prevents us even interpretting the problem in terms of probability."
philosophy,3dw7ua,ReallyNicole,2,Mon Jul 20 12:53:28 2015 UTC,"You're right that I was wrong when I said that it's not a math problem. It definitely involves math/probability. What I meant is that it's not only a math/probability problem, but also is a philosophical problem (specifically an epistemological problem). The observation selection effects (Bostrom's term) at play bring it into the realm of philosophy. Yes, it still involves math/probability.   You would be saying there is a 1 in 3 chance she is in some state, but this says nothing at all about the coin being heads or tails.   Yes it does, because the coin came up heads if and only if she is in the ""Monday-Heads"" state. If she ought to believe there is a 1/3 chance she's in that state (which I believe is correct), then she also ought to believe that there is a 1/3 chance that the coin came up heads.  EDIT: I think this reasoning for 1/3 is sound: https://www.princeton.edu/~adame/papers/sleeping/sleeping.pdf  EDIT 2: Also note that this paper replying to the above paper and arguing for the 1/2 view is mistaken.

This is not a case of ""1/2 chance of tails and two tails days thus 1/4 and 1/4"" because the two events are not exclusive. The chance for either tails day being 1/4 would be true if you could only wake up on EITHER a tails Monday OR a tails Tuesday, but never one and then the other (without knowing, which is what adds nuance to the question)  All three days have an equal probability of occurring. Think about it:  heads Monday occurs 5/10 times. Tails Monday occurs 5/10 times. If tails Monday occurs, so will tails Tuesday.

philosophy,3dw7ua,elbruce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:31:55 2015 UTC,"My intuition tells me this is really two separate problems.  First, there is the probability that the coin will come up heads vs tails. This is always a 50/50 scenario. There is always a 1/2 probability the coin will come up heads (or tails).  The more subtle issue is that of Sleeping Beauty's (SB) correctness. We assume that SB wants to be correct in her answer, so which answer, then, gives her the highest probability of correctness?  This is where I find it difficult to explain. Assuming SB is perfectly rational, she knows that she should answer tails every time to achieve the highest accuracy. If she answers tails, her accuracy looks like this:  [T,T,T] = [F,T,T].  which is 2/3 accurate.  But if she answers heads, it looks like this:  [H,H,H] = [T,F,F]  which is only 1/3 accurate.  If she decides to guess, it would look like one of the following:  [H,T,T] = [T,T,T] [H,T,H] = [T,T,F] [H,H,T] = [T,F,T] [T,H,T] = [T,F,T] [T,T,H] = [F,F,T] [T,H,H] = [F,F,F]    So it is interesting to note that these average out to 50/50- for any given guess, she has a 50% chance of being accurate.  Clearly, then it is in her best interest to always guess tails, because although it will not alter the probability of the coin toss, it will impact the number of times she will guess correctly.  Does that make sense?"

It's just that we have enough correlated data to make the assumption, when phi is high enough, that there is enough evidence to be confident in saying that there is 'something like you'.   What it tries to address however in more detail is, in essence similar questions that arise out of neuro correlates of consciousness, i.e. ""What exactly is it about this region of the brain that makes it correlate with consciousness?"" In this sense it is building on the findings in NCC and addresses unasked questions within that theory. Those and the gaps in our knowledge, by postulating the five axioms.  The fact that there are new questions arising out of answers given to previous problems is pretty normal. Especially when you start asking 'why' questions. The problem you are talking about is the same problem as in panpsychism.... having the idea that consciousness is a fundamental property of matter is great. But how does it add up, or how does it sum it's parts to lead to extremely complex forms of consciousness? Clearly it's not just quantitative, that if you just have enough mass it'll start to become conscious on its own. There is more needed. IIT starts to begin to answer questions in this direction. Saying that elements need to be integrated, of a certain composition and have cause and effect.   IIT tried to find answers by looking at our own experiences. Well, that's bound to be limited and bound to be incomplete. However, this is probably one of the more useful theories of consciousness in a practical set-up, this is what doctors want to know.

If we are a simulation that can create simulations and that proves we could be in a simulation, then the folks who put us into a simulation would also have a chance to be in a simulation. The probability is high as they said in the video. However the issue is then who or what made the first entities that created simulations? It can be simulations all the way around. At some point  you must have a beginning. A start to the events. However due to our understanding of rules you cannot mathmatically figure out that there is a beginning as there would have to be a beginning to that beginning.

Here's a relevant snippet from that article:   if we are indeed living in a hologram, ""the basic effect is that reality has a limited amount of information, like a Netflix movie when Comcast is not giving you enough bandwidth. So things are a little blurry and jittery. Nothing ever just stands still, but is always moving a tiny bit.""   Reality’s bandwidth fuzz, if you will, is exactly what Hogan’s lab is now trying to measure, using an instrument called the Holometer, which is basically a really big and powerful laser pointer.  “We are specifically trying to determine if there is a limit to the precision with which we can measure the relative positions of large objects,” postdoctoral researcher Robert Lanza told me in an email. “This would represent a fundamental limit in the actual information that the universe stores.”   The actual experiment that will decipher this involves measuring the relative positions of large mirrors separated by 40 meters, using two Michelson laser interferometers with a precision 1 billion times smaller than an atom. If, as according to the holographic noise hypothesis, information about the positions of the two mirrors is finite, then the researchers should ultimately hit a limit in their ability to resolve their respective positions.  “What happens then?” Lanza said. “We expect to simply measure noise, as if the positions of the optics were dancing around, not able to be pinned down with more precision. So in the end, the experimental signature we are looking for is an irreducible noise floor due to the universe not actually storing more information about the positions of the mirrors.”  The team is currently collecting and analyzing data, and expects to have their first results by the end of the year. Lanza told me they are encouraged by the fact that their instruments have achieved by far the best sensitivity ever to gravitational waves at high frequencies."

If this is true, due to relativistic effects, all of the information in our universe may be encoded on the event horizon of a black hole. Why's this cool? because then our universe may store data on a 2D plane, not 3D space as you would expect.

It might seem that the sum of third series should be larger that that of the second one, because we got series two by excluding numbers, and we got series 3 by multiplying them by 2.  If we look closer however, we must find out that both series are identical.  We seem to have a paradox. This happens because the number counts are infinite. You just can't compare infinities like you do with finite numbers.  Analogously, in an infinite root universe, an infinite number of simulations can be run. Each simulation can be infinitely complex. Comparing the complexity of the simulated university to that of the root one makes then no sense.  Obviously I'm assuming an infinite root universe.

My question is around the viability of that fudging. If it were lossless then you'd need a pretty impressive supercomputer to simulate an entire universe (i.e. one the size of our universe). If it were fudged then you could get away with a smaller supercomputer, but then could such a simulation be as detailed as it needed to be?

philosophy,3dte2y,joe_rivera,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:03:17 2015 UTC,The size is irrelevant. All parts of simulation are variables stored in the memory. To run bigger simulation you just need more memory and more computational power. The modern computers are increasing memory and power in geometric progression. So in some limited time they will reach needed memory and computational power.
philosophy,3dte2y,drukath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:14:55 2015 UTC,"Right so you need more memory and more power if you want to hold and process more information. And how is that information stored?  Let's use RAM as an example and build on it. RAM works by holding a bit of information (a 1 or 0) in a capacitor. Even if you could build a capacitor from a single atom it still means that your supercomputer needs 1 atom of RAM for each bit of information.  Let's say you wanted to store the x,y,z co-ordinate of an electron. You'd need at least 3 bits of information (one for each dimension), so 3 atoms of RAM. But that is only good if you wanted to have a universe that was 2x2x2 in size. If you wanted a universe that was 256x256x256 in size (still very small) then each dimension would require 8 atoms (as 28 gives 256). So that is 24 atoms of RAM to hold the x,y,z position of your tiny tiny universe.  For simplicity let's assume that the universe is discreet and cannot overlap such that the number of positions an electron can be in is defined by the array. Let's also assume the size of this discreet universe is equal to the size of one electron per cell. Let's now define the total maximum size of our mini-universe to be equal to the furthest man made object as a cube.  An electron is 2.8x10-15 in radius, so 5.6x10-15m in diameter.  Voyager 1 is the furthest man made object in space, at a distance of (quick wikipedia check) 17,922,521,702km, or about 1.8x1013m. This makes each dimension of our solar system sized universe equal in cells to 1.8x1013 / 5.6x10-15 = 3.21027 cells. This could be contained within 292, so that is 92 atoms for each dimension to hold the position, or 923 = 276 atoms.  So our computer now needs 276 atoms in it to hold the x,y,z position for each electron in your baby universe. If we were to apply this to all particles in your simulated universe (using some sort of grid system so that all information could be encoded at a solar-system size), even on a like for like basis (so electrons can be memory saved in electrons, photons in photons etc.) you would need a computer 276 times bigger than our current universe just to save it to memory.  Still think we will reach that in some limited time?"

If we have the equivalent of buffered texture loading as the observed space increases, then there is a non trivial, and potentially insolvable computability problem with the consistency of the boundary and beyond.  Let us say we have radiation moving away from a point in the universe And toward the physics engines boundary. If we discard the information at the boundary and then the user observes that region shortly thereafter, then the engine must attempt to extrapolate from previously rendered states and the previous elements of the configuration space of the simulation.  Either there will be observable inconsistencies within the simulation, or they are storing the entire history of the time evolution of the universe through its configuration space and the architecture is entirely synchronous such that our consciousness pauses waiting for the render.  This explodes combinatorially, and even if tenable would not be tractable in terms of utility unless they have a way of accelerating the simulation in some relative space-time distorted region from which they may extract the results...  It all just seems far too unlikely.  As for size limitations you are still constrained by information storage capacity, reducing runtime complexity does not imply reduction of memory complexity  Edit: unlikely that there would not be observable inconsistencies, not necessarily unlikely that our universe is a simulation"
philosophy,3dte2y,jalexan4,2,Sun Jul 19 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"I think we are still waiting to see if we can find some of these inconsistencies or evidence. I haven't heard anything new lately but here's a quote (link provided) from an article I read on how we could make a determination.    Last year, Beane and colleagues suggested a more concrete test of the simulation hypothesis. Most physicists assume that space is smooth and extends out infinitely. But physicists modeling the early universe cannot easily re-create a perfectly smooth background to house their atoms, stars and galaxies. Instead, they build up their simulated space from a lattice, or grid, just as television images are made up from multiple pixels. The team calculated that the motion of particles within their simulation, and thus their energy, is related to the distance between the points of the lattice: the smaller the grid size, the higher the energy particles can have. That means that if our universe is a simulation, we’ll observe a maximum energy amount for the fastest particles. And as it happens, astronomers have noticed that cosmic rays, high-speed particles that originate in far-flung galaxies, always arrive at Earth with a specific maximum energy of about 1020 electron volts.  The simulation’s lattice has another observable effect that astronomers could pick up. If space is continuous, then there is no underlying grid that guides the direction of cosmic rays — they should come in from every direction equally. If we live in a simulation based on a lattice, however, the team has calculated that we wouldn’t see this even distribution. If physicists do see an uneven distribution, it would be a tough result to explain if the cosmos were real.   So I don't know, but we haven't reached the apex of computing power yet, we haven't even gotten close to reaching it on a quantum computer, so we really don't know whether it's possible. I kind of feel like, at this stage, we are cavemen trying to determine whether a Delta airliner is possible.  http://discovermagazine.com/2013/dec/09-do-we-live-in-the-matrix"

For particulate radiation is there something special about that energy band? Do you have any context in that area?

philosophy,3dte2y,jalexan4,4,Sun Jul 19 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"Well, ""something as big"" is a very vague term. I mean, if we inserted an AI into our ""game world"" then we could have a universe that seemed infinitely ""big"" to them, and yet it was all contained on our hard drive. You could make something infinitely big by just programming the world to materialize upon observation. Therefore, anytime our AI grabbed a telescope and observed, they would observe something despite the ""distance"" they were able to observe.   To illustrate, there is a game called Mass Effect. In this game you can go to a large number of galaxies and land on and explore various worlds. To those of us that have played, we can explore everything in about 100 hours. However, if we insert AI we could make it harder to explore everything by simply altering their perspective of time and changing up the laws of physics.   An example of a different way is a new game that is in development in which the universe is basically infinite because it randomly generates new planets, galaxies, etc as you explore ""deeper"" into space. As long as you progress forward, the program will generate these new places, because you are observing these new places, it does not have to render the places you've already been, it can just save that data in memory until you observe it again. So the only real computation power needed is what it needs to generate and render things in your observational area. With random generation, you basically can explore infinite space."
philosophy,3dte2y,Ernst_Mach,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:36:48 2015 UTC,"I think we get into very freaky speculation if we suppose that this universe might have only a few minds in it, or that its apparent scale and complexity is being faked. It's like saying that trees in the forest disappear when no one is observing them, or that stars are lights mounted on the inside of a black sphere. Claims of this kind are usually taken as a sign of insanity.  You also have to admit some rather strong limitations on utility of any such simulation.."
philosophy,3dte2y,jalexan4,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:28:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not claiming things are or aren't a certain way. However, could you tell the difference, as you are, if you were the only self-aware mind? I could be programmed to simply type this response but may not have the self-awareness you do. This is getting into a whole other philosophical debate, which I don't believe in so I'm not going to support it. However, it isn't something that isn't very possible.  As far as the scale and complexity being faked, if we are in a simulation then everything is fake anyway, it doesn't matter if you render it all at once, or render only things being observed as they are observed. In the simulations that humans do, right now, this is precisely how it works. The only things that are rendered in a simulation or video game are the things that the player is observing at that moment. Not only is it not a stretch, since we are talking about reality being a simulation, to say that things would be rendered upon observation, but it is probable that this would be the case. There is no reason to put any undo strain on the system that runs us by keeping everything rendered despite no observers. You would save a tremendous amount of processing power by rendering as needed. In fact, if or maybe I should say when, we create AI ourselves there would be no reason to wait another 200 years until we build a computer strong enough to process a whole universe for that AI when we could use a computer today to render as needed. The AI wouldn't know the difference, only we would, and why would we care to render a whole universe if we didn't have to?   I'm not claiming anything like stars being mounted on the inside of a black sphere. I never claimed we were on a stage, this isn't the same thing as rendering a star when observed. In fact, electrons actually really do this. They only appear in a specific place when we observe them as a particle but, if left unobserved, they act as a wave.

It would further imply that any second-order simulation would have to be rigged by the original simulators.

If it's a simulation, then nothing really matters outside of the self-awareness of a group of beings inside that simulation. Everything else would be created, so it has no significance to the being that created it. The only reason you think our universe is more significant than you is because of it's perceived size as compare to you. If, instead of size, you used complexity as the criteria, well, what exists in the universe more complex than a self-aware mind? Especially to something that actually programmed the universe? Do you think that big rocks are really more interesting? Would you rather interact or observe a rock instead of an Intelligent being?  It doesn't violate Occams Razor at all. You are letting your subjective experiences and perceptions control you rationale. If, for instance, we found out tomorrow we existed in a simulation, that's extremely easy to understand and it isn't very complex. We can create simulations today, 10 year olds can program them. As compared to our current theory of things just popping up, not only can we not make things appear in a vacuum ourselves but you, instead, think it's less complex to expect it to randomly happen on it's own?

I understand your point about exact parallel, but I don't think the argument is particularly predicated thereupon. I think the crux is more, if we are capable of simulation of anything that detailed, then a larger universe must, then, be capable of simulating this one, and ergo it is a possibility no matter how remote.  I agree that the argument that there exists this possibility depends on the assumption that as we develop we will be capable of simulating a universe of the complexity of our own, but the scale is totally up for grabs.

Those clocks would be decoupled, and thus it would seem that time was progressing at a completely normal rate to those inside the simulation. They would be unaware of the fact that their time might not even be progressing as a linear function of the encapsulating simulations clock.   The issue would be, as you say, the pragmatics. If such a race were to undergo such an endeavor, perhaps to research the likely scenarios for the beginnings of life or the universe under different initial conditions, or perhaps to research possible ends thereto, they would likely wish to employ some reasonable heuristics.  Physics simulations have drift, because they are not numerically stable in many cases. And so to compensate, they may choose a fixed sampling grid or something of the like that is a reasonable approximation to the continuum to ensure that they needn't worry about that drift.   Thus, at least to me, it would seem that the artifacts that would be the most obvious under such a simulation would be quantization of energy / time-space. If you can define a ceiling to the resolution of reality and you find artifacts around that ceiling, that leads one to the conclusion that the universe is digital.  At that point, it is not quite as much a strain on credulity to question whether a digital universe is a simulation.   However, it could be that the real universe is fundamentally digital, or that the simulation is itself analogue--there are analog machines capable of computation--more on that another time though.

philosophy,3dte2y,timshoaf,4,Sun Jul 19 13:41:05 2015 UTC,"I would claim it is a bit stronger than that, it is effectively an entropy argument. It generally takes more energy to support a complicated system and the universe tends towards entropy. This for most systems the most common states for stable observations are the steady state solutions to even chaotic systems, ergo, for many, many chaotic systems, regardless of initial state, the system tends towards a set of steady states that have a cardinality far far less than those of the configuration space as a whole. Therefore, if what you are observing is indeed stable over time, it is likely (but not deterministic ally so) that what you are observing is one of these states.  These states tend to have many of the initial variables completely zeroed out and can thus be described with an input space of the steady state only. This is the most likely answer provided a set of observations.   Occam's razor is therefore more of a probabilistic argument than it is a strong claim for causality. But it does make sense for many systems in a steady state.  Picking an arbitrary snapshot of the configuration space without respect to duration, however, and attempting to use oceans razor on its entirety is thus inherently illogical."
philosophy,3dte2y,drukath,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:30:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, and that lack of entropy in this argument is disturbing.  Let's say that our universe is a simulation. To be a perfect simulation then the simulator would need to have as much entropy as our universe. Let's say that the standard model is correct and is also the most granular level of information, for the sake of the explanation (but it should work at any level).  At present in a current day computer if we wanted to just tag what each standard model particle in our universe was we'd need a bit of information. Just to store that bit of information requires more than one of these sub-atomic particles. But let's say that we did manage to use just one sub-atomic particle to tag the type of particle for each particle in our universe. That would require as many of those particles in the simulator universe as our own.  The alternative is that this is not a perfect simulation. Let's say our parent universe has discovered an order to depth beyond the standard model that we have not yet discovered, and are also able to manipulate this layer to store information. This means that our universe simulation is a fuzzier version than that.  But this seems to destroy the simulator argument that it can be simulators all the way down (or at least introduces a new assumption that we are among the first species to have reached this level of advancement). Otherwise each layer of simulation would have to get fuzzier (or smaller)"
philosophy,3dte2y,timshoaf,4,Sun Jul 19 20:09:52 2015 UTC,"That is how I see it as well, though I am not sure the 'potentially' turtles all the way down bit necessarily makes it impossible.   Assuming a finite real universe, one could continue recursing on smaller and smaller (or more and more restricted--fuzzier) universes until one ran into a universe in which the material allotted could not handle turing completeness at which point the chain must end. However there is nothing stopping that model from permitting us as either the first layer to accomplish this, or for us to be somewhere along the finite chain.  In an infinite universe, the chain could be infinite. In either case though, it isn't a destruction of the argument. Just a set of restrictions.   And so those restrictions are what I am proposing could point to truly testable hypothesis.  If we find evidence of predictable anomalies then there is a reasonable probability that this is a simulation. If not, it is not necessarily impossible to still be a simulation if it is just a faithful reproduction or perhaps partitioning of a greater universe, but that latter claim is basically a religious hypothesis at that point. It would also seem unlikely as it would not really profit the creators significantly. Anyway, it seems worth the experiment. If nothing else, we may stand to extend the standard model some.    As a side note, I have often mused that this is indeed a simulation but for an interesting reason:  You are a species of unparalleled technological advancement, and yet the collapse of the universe is upon you. You calculate that the amount of time to calculate a solution is longer than you have available. However, points towards the epicenter of collapse experience time at a faster rate than you, so you build a simulation of the relevant subset of your universe such that the inhabitants thereof will eventually face the same fate as you, you do this several million times hoping that some of them will be able to come up with a solution to the problem. you observe them. you wait until the terminus is about each of them, and they all blink out, except a few. you study them for their solution, and you implement it--or you go extinct in the hail mary that is this final play.   Anyway, I always thought it was a cute story, and no more or less believable than any other of the religions out there."

Time could be something that exists only in this universe, or perhaps in various distortions across multiple universe, who knows. Regardless, this argument only applies to anything created within our own space and time.   The explanation that the universe was programmed is alot less complex (because a 10 year old can program a world) than an explanation of nothing then something. I'm not saying that I refuse to believe it, if we can figure it out then fine. Right now, however, it's not that hard to fathom us being created, we create beings all the time in simulations ourselves. The difference being we are sentient and they aren't, so that only a single hurdle to jump. It is, however, extremely hard to fathom no matter, no time, no nothing, then poof, matter, time, and something.

This is only true under the assumption that the simulated universe must always simulate ALL of its universe.  It could be argued that you need only simulate the portions of the simulated universe which are under observation by the simulated beings and even then only to the resolution those particular observations require.  So while you may have to simulate an earths-worth of activities, you don't need to simulate the interaction of every single atom. Similarly, the rest of the simulated universe on a grand scale would not need to be computed until someone looked out a telescope; even then, only the region being examined would need to be simulated at any given time. Couple this with an ability to edit the simulated beings' memories, and it could easily appear perfectly simulated for a fraction of what it takes to actually simulate an entire universe from atoms to galaxies and beyond.  There may certainly be an upper limit to the number of nested universes for the reason you state, but that doesn't change the simulation argument's point.

If we assume we are in a simulation, what's to say these possibilities aren't applicable to our simulation?

Still, the United States seems like a bad candidate, for a pretty simple reason: It's hard to think of an activity the United States takes that couldn't be easily attributed to the conscious choice of one or a group of its members--usually, members who sit in government in some capacity. It's hard, therefore, to think of what something like an analogue for the 'hard problem' of consciousness vis a vis the US would look like: can you think of an activity of the US that can't be explained with reference to some other consciousness? (EDIT: The author seems to be trying to anticipate something like this with the Chalmers objection, but what he's missing about the Chalmers objection is precisely that it relies on a thesis about a distinction between consciousness and thought that he's simply passing over)  Now, again, this isn't to say one can't make a similar case about any distributed entity. Here's an example that seems fundamentally more plausible, for instance: a market. As practicing economists will tell you, describing the activity of a market often works better if one doesn't attempt to explain it from the perspective of any of the actors within a market. Markets appear to make choices, to regulate themselves, to work towards their survival and reproduction (the opening of new markets) in ways that are often hard to explain from the perspective of the deliberate choices of those within the markets, even though (like the human) they are only composed of those actors and the materials they manipulate.   This is why, in turn, I think there's a sort of disingenuity to the way the author tries to sidestep the problem of 'defining' or at least characterizing consciousness within the paper. It's not at all clear the the US is analogous to rabbits and humans, even if other distributed entities might be. Further, it's not at all clear that everyone is willing to accept that rabbits are conscious, even if it's pretty universally accepted that rabbits think. Sidestepping that issue cuts out most of where the meat of this sort of argument takes place."

It also leads people, like Schwitzgebel, down ridiculous trails of thought and toward ridiculous conclusions.  It seems to me that ""awareness"" is a much more appropriate word for the situation.

This was my first thought when reading this-- I don't accept that rabbits (or any given hypothetical aliens) are indisputably conscious. And even if they are conscious, it might not be the same consciousness as we ascribe to other humans. It doesn't seem inconsistent to me to view distributed entities as having their own emergent properties that might be similar to ours in some ways, and different in others. I think this lines up with Dennett's objection in the paper, which I think the author does a bad job of countering. How a distributed entity acts, feels, or speaks is different in important ways from how a non-distributed entity accomplishes these tasks, and I don't think we should cover over those differences because it's ""the best we can do with existing language"".  I also might've missed it, but I didn't see where the author might've laid down more restrictive definitions of what a distributed entity can and can't be. For instance, is a human, a rock, and the Eiffel Tower a distributed entity? This entity can clearly act and speak (although the human sure seems to be pulling most of the weight). If it's ""prejudiced"" to insist on particular structural relationships between entities in the distributed collective, where can we draw a line?

Circuitry that creates the ability to desire outcomes that may be contrary to how things will inevitably occur.  This ability does not necessarily need to be exercised.  When I say ""desire,"" I am referring exclusively to the ability to consider one or more potential interactions, and wish for a specific outcome.  This excludes reflex reactions such as those caused by the central and peripheral nervous systems (ex. when a person touches a hot object and pulls their hand away before the information reaches the brain, or a plant turning to face the sun.)  A working memory for relevant information to be stored and later accessed. This needs to interact in some way with the circuitry above to provide meaningful feedback for events as they occur.

philosophy,3dqid7,EverythingMakesSense,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:48:32 2015 UTC,"We can define neither life nor consciousness precisely. However a precise definition is unnecessary and often impossible. In order to discuss and study something there only has to be an agreement that we're talking about the same thing. For example defining 'speed' precisely is very complicated because it builds on 'time' and 'motion' of 'objects'. You don't need to define these things exhaustively to learn about how fast an apple falls or how fast the earth moves around the sun. It's enough if everyone knows what you mean by ""how fast the earth moves around the sun"". Language has to be clear in this sense, but does not have to be - and often cannot not be - precise. This is why Biology has been very succesfull in explaining life without having a good abstract definition of what life is.

philosophy,3dqid7,santaustinov,4,Sun Jul 19 11:32:29 2015 UTC,"I agree overall, and I think most people in this thread are way off, but the US does kinda possess consciousness in aggregate. We can collect the sum total thoughts and experiences of the 300 million Americans and say - look, there is America's consciousness.   Remember that whole ""how many sand grains makes a heap"" thing? When I look at this sub, I see a group of people gradually realizing that words break down when you push them far enough. There is no heap. There is just someone pointing at some sand grains and saying, ""Look there is a heap."" The universe does not have these boundaries.  We can say consciousness is everything that happens in an organism's nervous system. You could have some tiny organism with a single neuron that is either on or off. That is consciousness the same way a single atom is still matter.  I could argue that we could, with our big red marker, draw an outline around anything and inside there is consciousness. How does the universe know what to do? Just as one neuron does not know the whole human mind, one water molecule does not know the whole course of the Mississippi. It is the aggregate consciousness of many particles bumping into each other that decides where the ""Mississippi"" flows or what ""America"" buys or what ""/u/dumbest_name"" thinks about.  Furthermore, why is a collision between two molecules any different from an electrical signal between two neurons? What defines one system as conscious and another as not conscious?  We label the big patterns - the river - with words, and ignore the many tiny things that in aggregate make the pattern. ""Hey Steve, how is neuron #10,001 today?"" ""Oh, it is currently firing."" ""Wow how interesting!"" Now at night the philosopher jolts awake in a cold sweat wondering if Steve possesses consciousness."
philosophy,3dqid7,dumbest_name,2,Sun Jul 19 07:19:16 2015 UTC,"Neurons aren't on off switches, consciousness is defined by nested orders of integration, not collisions of matter.    If I have 300 million bacteria in a beaker would you say the beaker is conscious?  No.   Consciousness always implies integration of a whole.   There is a nested hierarchy of structure in evolution which intimately relates to what is conscious and what is not conscious.   An organism isn't just a collection of cells, it is a dance of millions of processes which all contribute to the overall function of the whole.   The overall compounded self-resonance and self-reflexivity of the system, present at every whole-part, is the underside of what we call consciousness.   Not simply a grouping of parts."

Ok, so we have this beaker with 300 million bacteria in it, and you've said the beaker has not enough integration to be called conscious. This I disagree with.  Here is the thing. The distinction you drew - dividing the beaker from what is ""conscious"" - I think the distinction breaks down when considered more closely.  The beaker is extremely complicated and structured. Every part inside the beaker interacts with every other part to make the beaker behave exactly as it does. All the parts integrate deeply into the structure of the whole, the ""whole"" is just in this case an arbitrary beaker of bacteria.   When I take my big red marker, draw a circle around the beaker, and name it Barney the Bacteria Beaker, now we have here a distinct entity. Barney the Bacteria Beaker even possesses intent! He wants to continue to obey the laws of physics. He wants to continue to behave like a beaker containing 300 million bacteria. His many parts work together to accomplish this, and their interaction forms his consciousness.  The point is not that ""Barney the Bacteria Beaker"" is conscious in our familiar sense, but rather that he is sort of conscious. I am stretching and deconstructing the concept of ""consciousness"" because I think these abstract terms lead philosophers into all sorts of bullshit arguments and quandaries.  Maybe it's annoying to say this, but wouldn't we see the world more clearly if we did not think in these abstract terms but just said, ""things are what they are"" and started there?

philosophy,3dqid7,dumbest_name,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:47:20 2015 UTC,"Well as a panpsychism-supporter I appreciate the way you want to rethink consciousness as a more general feature of the cosmos instead of a secluded rarity, but I take issue with this -   The distinction you drew - dividing the beaker from what is ""conscious"" - I think the distinction breaks down when considered more closely.   I don't think it breaks down at all. There are very straightforward structural and behavioral and phenomenological reasons to see the emergence of consciousness as intimately dependent on the increasing complexity and integration of each organisms structure.   The reason we are so self-aware, i.e.  ""more conscious""  generally speaking than a worm or a bacteria or a dog is because of our inherent structure.   All the parts integrate deeply into the structure of the whole, the ""whole"" is just in this case an arbitrary beaker of bacteria.   Well that's just not true.  The bacteria do not move as one, they move as 300 million independent agents, each with its own drive, not contributing to any higher order agency.   Of course the bacteria are all intermingling and affecting each others movements, so what we see is an emergent dance between them, like a flock of birds or a school of fish.  But as soon as those bacteria evolve into multi-cellular life forms like a seaweed bush for instance, the individual cells dont just dance as a result of 300 million separate agents, but in terms of the one whole higher order agency we call th seaweed plant.  Literally everything in the cosmos touches eachother and interacts.  That doesn't mean there isnt a categorical difference between a collection of tree cells, and a living, breathing integrated whole organism called a tree.  These distinctions are not arbitrary, they are very straightforward categorical differences in structure and behavior.    Compared to an organism, the beaker just doesn't display the kind of integration that would classify a new whole in evolution.   The increase of consciousness in the world - the ability to cognize what is present - is always marked by increasing structural complexity and integration of the organism which displays it.    I think consciousness is a fundamental feature of space time like mass, charge, spin, and the weak and strong forces.   It is not logically supervenient on any physical laws.  But as best we can tell, the emergence of consciousness from spacetime is inseparably related to the integration and general complexity of the structure of its substrate."

philosophy,3dqid7,hogalot,5,Sat Jul 18 17:54:56 2015 UTC,"This objection is brought up in the paper itself:   Dretske’s objection. Fred Dretske, in correspondence, has suggested that the United States could not be conscious because its representational states depend on the conscious states of others.  Such dependence, he says, renders its representations conventional rather than natural – and a conscious entity must have natural representations.[23]  In earlier work, Dretske (1995) highlights the implausibility of supposing that an object that has no intrinsic representational functions can become conscious simply because outside users impose representational functions upon it.  We don’t make a mercury column conscious by calling it a thermometer, nor do we make a machine conscious by calling it a robot and interpreting its outputs as speech acts.  The machine either is or is not conscious, it seems, independently of our intentions and labels.  A wide range of materialists, I suspect, will and should accept that an entity cannot be conscious if all its representations depend in this way on external agents.  Focusing on such cases, Dretske’s independency criterion seems appealing.  But the citizens and residents of the United States are parts of the U.S. rather than external agents, and it’s not clear that the dependency of consciousness on the intentions and purposes of internal agents is problematic in the same way, if the internal agents’ behavior is properly integrated with the whole.  The internal and external cases, at least, are sufficiently dissimilar that before accepting Dretske’s principle in general form we should at least consider some potential internal-agent cases.  The Antarean antheads seem to be just such a case, and I’ve suggested that the most natural materialist position is to allow that they are conscious.  Furthermore, although Dretske’s criterion is not exactly an anti-nesting principle in the sense of Section 2, it is subject to the same concerns.  In its broad form it seems unmotivated, except by a desire to exclude the very cases in dispute, and it brings new counterintuitive consequences in its train, such as loss of consciousness upon inhaling Planck-scale people whose actions are smoothly incorporated into one’s brain functions.  On Dretske’s proposed principle, as on the anti-nesting principles of Section 2, entities that behave identically on a large scale and have superficially similar evolutionary and developmental histories might either have or lack consciousness depending on micro-level differences that are seemingly unreportable (to them), unintrospectible (to them), unrelated to what they say about Proust, and thus, it seems natural to suppose, irrelevant.  Dretske conceives his criterion as dividing “natural” representations from “conventional” or artificial ones.  Maybe it is reasonable to insist that a conscious being have natural representations.  But from a telescopic perspective national groups and their representational activities are eminently natural – as natural as the structures and activities of groups of cells clustered into spatially contiguous individual organisms.  What should matter on a broadly Dretskean approach, I’m inclined to think, is that the representational functions emerge naturally from within rather than being imposed artificially from outside, and that they are properly ascribed to the whole entity rather than only to a subpart.  Both Antarean opinions about Shakespeare and the official U.S. position on Iran’s nuclear program appears to meet these criteria."

philosophy,3dqid7,EverythingMakesSense,4,Sat Jul 18 19:46:26 2015 UTC,"Fun read, interesting topic, but I don't think the US can be said to be a conscious entity yet.   Is a hydrogen atom unnecessary once one admits the proton and electron into one’s ontology?  What makes it necessary, or not, to admit the existence of consciousness in the first place?  It’s obscure why the necessity of admitting consciousness to Antarean antheads should depend on whether it’s also necessary to admit consciousness among the individual ants.   Evolutionarily speaking, it doesn't matter what level you look at - if a unified whole like a molecule is nested with other molecules in a higher whole like a cell, you have a new whole.   The parts become unified in a higher order system.    The order in humans roughly goes quarks, atoms, molecules, cells, organism, reptillian brain stem, limbic system, neo cortex, triune brain, each enveloped, integrated, and unified into a new whole system at each step.     Both the Antheads and the Supersquids have their own unifed central loci of consciousness.   The ten million ants that reside in the anthead create a new whole, a higher emergent stream that the head experiences as unified consciousness.   Same with the squid.   That is a lot different than the United States.   Its citizens are not currently contributing to a higher nested locus of experience in the evolutionary unfolding of consciousness. There's no subjective experience of being the United States.   What is it about brains, as hunks of matter, that makes them special enough to give rise to consciousness?  Looking in broad strokes at the types of things materialists tend to say in answer – things like sophisticated information processing and flexible, goal-directed environmental responsiveness, things like representation, self-representation, multiply-ordered layers of self-monitoring and information-seeking self-regulation, rich functional roles, and a content-giving historical embeddedness – it seems like the United States has all those same features.  In fact, it seems to have them in a greater degree than do some beings, like rabbits, that we ordinarily regard as conscious.   Just because a collection of different bacteria, for example, develops an incredible mutual symbiosis with eachother, becomes an integrated system which can be said to be self-regulating, environmentally responsive, etc, doesn't mean it is a conscious system.   It is simply an emergent dance between beings that are.   It looks conscious because while caused by the interaction of (very subtly) conscious entities, none of the bacteria contribute to a new unified whole.     So it is not accurate to say the interdependent system of bacteria is conscious.    n. consciousness - 1. the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings, 2.  the awareness or perception of something by a person, 3.  the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world.  Consciousness always implies an experience.    To say a thing is conscious is to say it is experiencing.   If the thing that acts like a brain (the US) isn't actually having its own subjective experience, then I don't think it is accurate to call it conscious.   It is an emergent system made of conscious beings.   One day it might become conscious through computer-brain linkages of all of its conscious parts.

Can you imagine the kind of emergent processes going on in a human mind, much less one cell?   The integrated processes of the human brain probably range in the billions, with many of them inter-dependent on each other's activity.    Our brain is a vibrating, radiating bee hive of integrated process.  I don't see any example of technology advanced enough to actually link humans in the way a human brain is self-integrated.

I suppose he could still differ from the majority of panpsychists by arguing that there is a significant degree of complexity and activity required for consciousness to emerge in a system, whereas the panpsychist would say all matter and energy, no matter how static and disparate, is fundamentally subjective in nature.  Personally, this is tricky for me and has actually been a problem for quite some time. I find myself no longer persuaded by mainstream materialism, and intrigued by panpsychism, or some form of idealism (gasp!), but then I'm left with the question, what separates individual minds?  Some theorists like Donald Hoffman propose that literally everything that can be called an object, including every cell and atom in my body, is its own individual conscious subject, with its own unique point of view. Even David Chalmers entertains the notion that rocks might be conscious.  I have to admit that although I like panpsychism, I really dislike that view on aesthetic/parsimony grounds, although it's difficult to argue against it. The best I can do is just to demand that it makes human existence too lucky, but that's a bad argument. Or I could point to a correlation between consciousness and high complexity, but then we're just back at the hard problem and some degree of brute emergence (materialism).  There's an amateur philosopher with a YouTube channel and a couple of books who calls himself an idealist. His name is Bernardo Kastrup, and his solution to the problem is to say that, while technically everything is conscious, more complex forms of consciousness tend to ""outshine"" or ""drown out"" the lower forms. But this seems to be a messy ""solution,"" and it seems to lead to weird consequences. Like, wouldn't the largest conscious systems (like our solar system) just automatically drown out every lower lifeform like human beings? If all humans suddenly disappeared, would dogs and cats gain a little bit of consciousness?  We need to be able to precisely, physically define this ""drowning out"" process to take it seriously. My own guess is that it would have something to do with the degree of ""compactness"" and ""business"" of a system, as well as the degree of separation between them, so there wouldn't really be any drowning out after all, only individuation, but then what of the space inbetween conscious systems? I feel like Roger Penrose's and Stuart Hameroff's ""Orchestrated objective reduction"" theory fits well into this picture and could be a solution to this problem, where systems like human brains ""reduce"" an otherwise non-local, proto-conscious reality to a subjective state.

He could make the point somewhat quicker by pointing out that we are spatially-distributed entities; our cognitive processes rely on neurotransmitters voyaging the gaps between synapses.  The super-squids and antheads are somewhat more dramatic examples, but as Schwitzgebel says, not different in principle from humans.  The title example, however, does strain credulity.  Why?  Any physicalist worth their salt will claim that there are a bevy of natural laws that govern the promotion of mere collections of natural objects to conscious entities.  While Schwitzgebel argues persuasively that spatial contiguity is not one of these conditions, there may well be others that rule out the US as a candidate.  Some of these conditions might be:   A network with a minimum degree of homogeneity and connectivity between the nodes.  That is, each node needs to be connected to a minimum number (which might itself be variable) of other nodes, and each node needs to have relevant similarity of function. A minimum degree of activity on the network each second.  Enough signals might need to be passed back and forth continuously to keep the entity conscious.    A minimum degree of signal strength.  The signals may need to be of sufficient quality and fidelity to enable the correct functions of each node.  Depending on the signal medium, this constraint could put further physical limitations on the size of the entity and how distributed it could be.  For instance, the super-squid example, as written, is implausible, as light diffuses very quickly in water, making it an unattractive medium for keeping a network functioning underwater.   All of these conditions are speculation, but they do offer the physicalist some good reasons to be cautious about assigning consciousness to large, composite and distributed entities."

I would change it to something like:  ""For a system that contains some conscious sub-entities, the overall system can only be considered a collective consciousness if the rate of signals passed between conscious sub-entities is reasonably close (for some unspecified definition of 'reasonably close') to the rate of signals passed through an average location within a sub-entity.

Given a community of such organisms, one would have an evolutionary advantage in being able to predict the behavior of others of its kind. The internal model required to do this might eventually cross a threshold where it incorporated the fact that the behaviors of others of its kind toward it were based in part on their internal models of it. Then evolutionary pressure drives the organism to develop an increasingly sophisticated internal model of itself, to keep up with its peers ability to model it.  More broadly, it appears that sufficient conditions for the evolution of consciousness, or as I prefer to call it, self-awareness, include a system which is capable of integrating sensory data to form predictive models of the world, where these models are sufficiently sophisticated to account for the fact that others of its kind possess such models. There will be levels of self-awareness, according to the computational prowess of an entity, and the amount of evolutionary advantage conveyed by its ability to predict the actions of others of its kind. This path to self-awareness would not seem to lead to singular self-aware organisms. They would always exist in a community.  If we consider the United States as a country among countries, some kind of community does exist. Certainly there are organizations within the US which attempt to predict the behavior of other countries, and some of them probably take into account the organizations in other countries which are trying to predict the US. What seems to be missing are the factors that would enable evolution. The number of countries is relatively small, and the ""gene"" pool even smaller. Countries are also substantially mismatched in economic and military power, more so than individual people. Differences in geography, climate, and distribution of natural resources mean that countries tend to find their own niche, rather coexist within a single niche.  I am a materialist when I'm wearing my science hat, and I don't conclude that the US is conscious, nor expect it to be in the foreseeable future.

philosophy,3dppd9,ReallyNicole,11,Sat Jul 18 06:23:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I see the strength of first objection to the reduction of hypothetical normativity. Hypothetical imperatives do give reasons for anyone satisfying the hypothetical of the statement, but the motivational content is embedded in the desire. And so when Sally desires cookies, this is stating her motivation to achieve a future state where she possesses cookies. Baking cookies being one possible way to achieve this desired state, Sally has a reason to bake cookies. And so the queerness of the 'counts in favor of' is avoided by the nature of a desire.  It is not surprising that a simple statement of a desire for cookies cannot distinguish between present aim and whole life accounts of hypothetical imperatives, as there is simply not enough information given in the hypothetical to make such a determination. But it seems pretty straightforward to adjudicate between competing desires if we enumerate all of them and give them relative weights. Then the course of action that maximizes her expected satisfaction is the one she ought to do. How competing desires are ranked, and how to rank present vs future satisfaction would be values that Sally would have to attest to. While surely a complicated calculation, I see nothing that a reductionist account of hypothetical normativity couldn't handle."

If I'm getting you right you want to suggest a reduction like the following:   To say that S has a reason to Φ just is to say that (if S desires that Φ and P satisfies a means-end relation about S and Φ), then S will thereby be motivated to Φ.   I dunno if this is quite right. Suppose, for example, that I desire cookies. I have a belief that I can buy cookies at store A, but not at store B. In reality, though, it's exactly swapped; going to store B would satisfy my desire and going to store A would not. I have a common sense reason to go to store B and on Olson's view I have a reducible reason to go to store B, but I'm not at all motivated to go  to store B.  This sort of reduction might also face objections that have been deployed against synthetic moral naturalism, but I'd have to go check up on that.   But it seems pretty straightforward to adjudicate between competing desires if we enumerate all of them and give them relative weights.   Sure, and in the case that hypothetical imperatives give us reason we can give that weight to the favouring relations in those reasons, but wherein does the weight lie if there are no favouring relations to hypothetical imperatives? Maybe you think that we can construct counterfactuals of the form ""if S had desires D1, D2, and D3, whichever one has more weight will just be the one that ends up motivating S given that she has all three at the same time."" But this counterfactual is either opaque or begs the question in favour of one desire of the others. I say it's opaque because there's nothing about the claim ""S has desire D1, D2, and D3,"" that, by itself, sheds any light on what would motivate S. Thus I say that it might beg the question in favour of on desire over the others because any information we inject about which desire is stronger in order to break the opaqueness just is the answer we're looking for."

I think drawing a distinction between her first and second order motivations can clarify the problem. We can say that S is (first-order) motivated to P if S believes that P satisfies a means-end relation about S and a desire Φ. This seems to be the example you offered about Sally's incorrect belief.  Additionally, we can say that S is (second-order) motivated to believe the truth about P inasmuch as it furthers her desires Φ. This latter claim seems like a straightforward corollary to being motivated to realize one's desire. We can then say that Sally ought to be motivated to P' (that which actually realized Φ), which can be further reduced to Sally ought to believe that P' on the strength of Sally's recognition of the process that demonstrates P'.  Categorical normativity is lost here, i.e. we cannot say ""Sally ought to believe that P'"" on the strength of a process unacknowledged by Sally as being a justified belief-forming process. But I don't see that as a big loss. Taking the creationist example, a creationist might dismiss the conclusion of the process that demonstrates the world is over 6000 years old. But then we (perhaps) can show that he relies on that same process when he flies in an airplane, or uses a computer, or any product of knowledge derived from the scientific method.

Off the top of my head the obvious problem with this is analogous to the problem with construing valuing as desiring. To put it in terms of reasons: the heroin addict has an intense desire to satisfy her craving and knows that shooting up is the means to satisfying her craving. It does not follow, though, that she thereby has a reason to shoot up.  As I said earlier, there might be reason to think that conventional objections to synthetic moral naturalism (objections which the error theorist obviously endorses) apply just as well here as they do to moral naturalism, but I still haven't checked up on that.  Edit: Also, I suspect that there's a broader worry here for the error theorist. Namely, if we accept some kind of synthetic normative naturalism about hypothetical or epistemic imperatives, then why can't that same analysis be applied just as well to moral imperatives? There's obviously a lot more that needs to be said to develop this, but I think it's at least a fair question for the error theorist."

It addresses an example benefit of the experience of philosophical pursuit. I won't hesitate to say that benefit exists... But in the current zeitgeist we don't see a lot of value placed on independent thought free of ideology, now do we? It's romanticized, but not actually valued. You don't see many philosophers with Patreon accounts.  In the richest countries of the world, where education is theoretically at its best, we don't see much nurturing in this regard. Why? Because it undermines the ideologies already in place. The most prominent being an expectation of an end product, whether it be a service or something tangible. Medicine affects change on people, psychology does as well although it is more hotly argued, etc. So those areas of study are seen as 'productive' despite their highly internalized process of logic, etc... and therefore free of active aggression by the dominant ideologues. But philosophy? It very much has the reputation of naval gazing still. It's more productive from society's standpoint to be the one throwing shadows on the wall to entertain the masses, and as such, celebrity runs rampant.  So to answer how philosophy can make itself relevant... The entire field would need to either make an impact so great against those standing ideologies that a popular movement formed endorsing philosophy, or individual philosophers need to start contributing an end product. Right now, there is a tendency for philosophers to write off others who 'armchair philosophize' to the masses. After all, supposedly pop philosophy is worthless. Right? But it isn't. It engages the cultural audience by appealing to their existing interests. Those philosophers are at least leaving an accessible product in their wake. Not another textbook for teaching philosophy classes.  Philosophers, traditionally, were rarely just philosophers. They were engineers, seminarians, ideological malcontent writers, poets, chemists, and so on. Their philosophy made it into the public mind through their works. Like politicians who used to do politics in addition to another pursuit, but politicians have the power to define their own gains for their intangible (and possibly corrupt) works... Philosophers don't hold that kind of authority.  To be truly relevant, we would need to see philosophers taking on clients and helping them figure their reality out. Or we would need to see philosophers assigned to schools like guidance counselors. Or just at least have them out in the open screaming their concerns at the world. Instead, most are indoors breathing marker dust or buried in old books. That's not accessible, and inaccessible means you might as well not exist.

I do believe there is a place for ""practicing philosophers"" in the culture.

philosophy,3dkwpn,godx119,2,Fri Jul 17 11:28:55 2015 UTC,"I've looked into that line of thought pretty heavily. Practicing interpersonal philosophy in a therapeutic manner requires licensing because of the groundwork in place from psychology and pastoral counseling. At least in the US where I'm talking from. This is due to the fact that anyone performing any kind of therapy, no matter the source, isn't subject to any governmental protections unless they're licensed.  Meaning if someone were dealing with a problem caused by an illegal act, you become complicit in covering up that illegal act by knowing about it but not reporting it. Mandatory reporting is the trade-off for the few legal protections a therapist gets.  So there would need to be a body of practicing philosophers and they would need to seek licensing for perceived credibility if nothing else."
philosophy,3dkwpn,Deightine,2,Fri Jul 17 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"Well said. But philosophy, at it's core, is about the analysis of argument. You might have read in the article how analytical philosophy is somewhat disparaged, because Ideas in Capital Letters are Bad and we should be humble and all that. It's not even so much that philosophy doesn't produce a product. It's the idea that philosophy, even done proper, has no ""right answer"". It's just the collection of random theories! Pick one, whatever ""works for you"". We don't judge, it's all subjective.   You know where the objective minded philosophers are, just listen to AM radio or Fox News, they have grand theories about the world they aren't afraid to share authoritatively (and of course they aren't the only ones). Thing is, philosophy is very popular it just isn't called such and it doesn't resemble what happens in the classroom.  Just like before, the people out there really doing philosophy aren't even called philosophers. They write books and songs and movies and blog posts, while the ""real"" philosophers are in the library or at home. When you think about it, every politician is a philosopher, especially if they consider their work to be ""finding the good"" since this would mean they have to determine what the good is and then how to best spread it, etc.   I'm not convinced having a philosophy degree doesn't just mean you know of lots of philosophies, and you're good at studying them and not necessarily making them. Nonetheless, philosophy as formal argument analysis I believe is the best hope for perceived and actual relevance to be done by academic philosophers. (Too bad the employed will rarely risk their jobs to take a public stand)   There are exceptions though. I like to think fact checkers come very close to applying philosophy in a real and useful way. That's a product I'd like to see sold by philosophers: arguments and theories debunked. Make it a TV show, I'd watch it. More debates. Philosophy should be more like math than poetry, but more people seem to want to be poets."
philosophy,3dkwpn,dare3000,3,Fri Jul 17 08:25:35 2015 UTC,"But philosophy, at it's core, is about the analysis of argument.   If you assume a philosopher's job is to lay around and fact-check people, perhaps. But even philosophy has its own internal ideologies. For example, I'm firmly of the belief that the majority of philosophy's genuine work is internal. The love of wisdom is a personal pursuit. The first question a philosopher asked would have been ""Why?"" not ""Is this false? Is this wrong?"" because logical, rhetorical, and moral argument are the children of raw questioning.   It's the idea that philosophy, even done proper, has no ""right answer"". It's just the collection of random theories! Pick one, whatever ""works for you"". We don't judge, it's all subjective.   I understand where you're approaching it from, but I think that depends on the particular cultural group you're talking to. Some view philosophy as crippled by inactivity, others view it as a source of ever more questions and never any answers. There are a number of reasons I've heard cited for why it isn't trusted. I recently had someone pull out philosophy in a conversation with me (not knowing I've been pursuing it much of my life) as an example of a wasted college degree; I didn't hold that against him for long... He didn't realize it had any purpose at all. Similarly, I once had a Psychology PhD student ask me why I would ever want to waste my time in a philosophy class. All I could respond with was ""What is PhD an acronym for? Do you know? I would hope so.""   When you think about it, every politician is a philosopher, especially if they consider their work to be ""finding the good"" since this would mean they have to determine what the good is and then how to best spread it, etc.   You're describing someone chasing after good, but not necessarily wisdom. There is a difference between spreading an ideology and understanding an ideology. Most politicians in this day and age are professional ideologues, manipulating an ideology toward an agenda. But it is very much a case-by-case issue; some politicians might be doing their work in good faith (Sartre's/Camus' faith, as opposed to religious faith), while others are manipulating it to use people as a Means to an End. I'm of the thinking that the latter is an abuse of authority when that End is not the people themselves. Perhaps I've read too much Kant.   Philosophy should be more like math than poetry, but more people seem to want to be poets.   Life is a balance of math and poetry; philosophy is the pursuit of wisdom in relation to the experience of living. To choose one over the other, either way, is to gain a skewed perspective of the human experience. It narrows one's field of understanding and limits the versatility of their skill set. That's why a philosophy degree isn't just a series of logic courses, although the analytical branches would likely prefer it that way. We aren't all Wittgenstein.  I suspect you would count me among those people who ""want to be poets."" I favor Eastern philosophy over Western, koans over syllogisms, and poetry over mathematics. I value both but I acknowledge a natural leaning toward the philosophies that encourage growth within the thinker and the expansion of awareness over the ever-refining subdivision of a limited worldview. In the west I chase Hegel and Camus, while in the east I chase Nagarjuna and Basho. They all have value; subjective and objective, but only to an individual until it is applied. Then it has a value that spreads out to be appreciated by others. But usually, it is camouflaged by the actions of the one who has found that value.  When I say philosophy needs an end product, it can be anything tangible that is accessible to a wider audience. Even if it were more poetry... Two centuries ago, the world was flush with poetry and despite fewer people able to read, more readers were influenced by philosophers directly and indirectly. Now the world is largely better educated, many can read, but they don't. Philosophy, the crunchy and fluffy sides, are neither appealing to anyone outside of philosophy. The most damning thing we can do for ourselves is spend our time philosophizing for other philosophers. We need public engagement to be relevant. It's inherent in the very language of the preceding sentence; to be relevant is to be ""closely connected or appropriate to the matter at hand."" To be relevant to our world, we have to be connected to our world."

But I have a difference of opinion with certain western logical debates regarding paradoxes.  I've seen logic in poetry, clarity in paradox, and so on.

Of course, it is implied that it is through teaching epistemic humility but the link was never neatly tied together and it was left to the reader to make it.   The article thus seemed somehow lazily written.   (2) I take issue with this quotation:   The worst enemy of the best philosophy is ideology in all its forms. Philosophy at its best evinces deep skepticism about the stories powerful people and institutions tell about How Things Are. It models the virtues of not knowing what one thought one knew. The natural home of philosophy is in the agora, not the ivory tower. The question is whether the academy can bear to confront that truth.   While philosophy has been used to ruffle feathers and can be said to have this unspoken democratic inclination to it... this is not always the case. Plato's writings come off as elitist in their anti-mercantile spirit, and if anything wishes to compel people towards more elitism, more structure, not less of it.   While philosophy takes issues with competing ideologies it seems to be the very place where ideologies thrive, for it is the world of the theory.   (3) I would say if someone doesn't see the usefulness of philosophy right off they are just like someone who doesn't see the usefulness of history... There is almost no point in discussing with them, really.   I do not mean to sound derogatory, but if you are a Philistine who only sees purpose in the practical application of an object, your opinion on most issues will always be irrelevant to me.   The greatest questions of all, and the trickiest, are the ones that attempt to handle ethical issues, the nature of reality, etc.. If you do not see the worth in people being well versed in these topics, what can I say? Is saying these are worthwhile topics really a hard-to-defend position?  Oddly enough it is the democratization / egalitarianism of thought these days that has convinced people that philosophy is irrelevant in part because they feel that their own opinions are perfectly adequate on complex, difficult questions. They think science is some mysterious method of attaining objective truth, and philosophy is something that we can all do with little to no effort.

If you have any sympathies for a counterfactual analysis of causation, you'll find the following very strange: if I took away any finite subset of gods, this wouldn't change the existence of the barrier one bit. But then you might think that none of the gods in this subset could have been causally responsible for the barrier, since they could have been removed and the barrier would still be there. And since the subset could have included any gods you'd like, by repeating enough times we'll see that none of the gods is causally responsible for this barrier.

This does not follow from what you stated before. There is no validity in going from ""I remove a finite subset of gods, therefore since there are still infinite gods remaining and the barrier remains"" to ""I've removed an infinite number of finite subsets of gods, therefore the barrier must still remain.""  In order to remove all the gods in the manner you state, you must still participate in an infinite process, which you may as well just state ""I've removed every single god"" in which case your claim that the barrier must still remain is false (edit: in case you haven't read this or others stumble across it, you can still remove an infinite amount of finite subsets and be left with infinite gods, but I stated it liked I did previously on the assumption that ""we'll see that none of the gods is causally responsible for this barrier"" as meaning all the gods have been removed).

The twin paradox, for example, which is the closest thing we have to a true paradox outside of sheer fiction comes to mind. Most paradoxes, this one included aren't paradoxical at all, they have a fundamental flaw in either the logic, the premises, or a manipulation of either terms or the system itself.   This is not a paradox as it hinges on two things that break it: the aforementioned inconstancy by assuming something and then denying the consequent in such a manner as to make the premise false (the main reason this seems paradoxical) and then there's the inconsistency. The magic barriers argument is the same as the arrow paradox/ turtle paradox/ Achilles paradox: I have something that cannot be crossed, and an infinite number of them, and as such they can be crossed-- wicked awesome paradox there /s."

Most paradoxes, this one included aren't paradoxical at all, they have a fundamental flaw in either the logic, the premises, or a manipulation of either terms or the system itself.   That's not entirely true. There are well known paradoxes (or if we're trying to categorize our paradoxes, these ones are known as antinomies ) that have no obvious flaw in their reasoning but still reach a contradiction. A famous example would be Russell's paradox.   assuming something and then denying the consequent in such a manner as to make the premise false   That's how the reasoning in a number of famous paradoxes works. Perhaps you could elaborate on why that seems wrong to you?   The magic barriers argument is the same as the arrow paradox/ turtle paradox/ Achilles paradox: I have something that cannot be crossed, and an infinite number of them, and as such they can be crossed   This isn't strictly correct. In the Achilles paradox, I have an infinite number of things that I CAN cross. But I don't have infinite time to cross them... and thus they can't all be crossed."
philosophy,3di5el,penpalthro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"For me there is a common underlying theme to all of the paradoxes that I've seen thus far. The first is simply the cleaver shifting of either the nature of the system or the false analogy built somewhere into them. Zeno's, for example, only works in a mathematical abstract. The moment it is tested to verify if it is in fact a paradox one of the fundamental arguments breaks.  For me the split between math and physics is existence. Existence is not a predicate, and as such any paradox that involves the physicality of something will inevitably break due to simple physical law or phenomena. The math of all of these paradoxes constructed in the zeno-esque fashion and up being infinity plus infinity ad nauseum equals 1 at the end of the day anyway. That's just my objection, however."
philosophy,3di5el,Agnostros,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:57:12 2015 UTC,"This isn't my specialty, however this is really fascinating.  It seems to me that the reason Alice would stop at A is because there are infinite Gods between A and 1/2 meter past A where G1 is.  We have the distances for G1, G2, and G3, but since there is an infinite number of Gm then the Gods between A and G3 must be so closely bunched together... and perhaps the point is that there is a calculable distance between A and G1 that does make the number of Gods finite.  That still doesn't really give me much insight into what stops Alice at A, other than that the vast number of Gm will work it's way up to the first calculable point succeeding A."
philosophy,3di5el,neuropathica,2,Fri Jul 17 02:14:44 2015 UTC,"So something like this, assuming Alice exists in a continuous system, implies a dense system of gods. For any point, p_i, that exists after A that you can give me, I can find a god in between A and p_i. So there is no first calculable point succeeding A. Even if we assume Alice exists in a system similar to the rationals, it still follows that for any rational point after A you give me, there exists another rational point in between.  What stops Alice at A is a barrier at A. The paradoxical nature derives from our difficulty in understanding what happens ""after"" an infinite process. For any given location that Alice exists in, a series of decisions must happen by the gods to determine whether or not to construct a barrier. When Alice arrives at point A, after the process of infinite gods deciding to construct a barrier, a barrier at A manifests."

philosophy,3ddi48,ArchitectofAges,9,Wed Jul 15 12:33:17 2015 UTC,"Dear Mr. of Ages,  I think you (is it you?) have given a good account of what we might call the common view of these philosophical movements, but I think when we get into their details we find that they're more significantly more nuanced than this common view admits--and, notably, more nuanced in a way that mitigates against the self-refutation objection.  Starting with Hume, the complication is that his notion of ""impressions"" is much broader a notion than we usually think of when we think of sensations or something like this.  Humean ""impressions"" includes some very important cases of information that is coming from internal states of the thinker, and this brings it much closer to rationalist epistemology than is supposed by the common view.  In fact, Hume chastises Locke essentially for being an empiricist, in the way the common view understands this term, and--notably--with essentially the same criticism Leibniz offers.  Here's Hume:   The first proposition he [(Hume speaking here of himself)] advances is, that all our ideas, or weak perceptions, are derived from our impressions, or strong perceptions, and that we can never think of any thing which we have not see without us, or felt in our own minds.  This proposition seems to be equivalent to that which Mr. Locke has taken such pains to establish, viz. that no ideas are innate.  Only it may be observed, as an inaccuracy of that famous philosopher, that he comprehends all our perceptions under the term of idea, in which sense it is false, that we have no innate ideas.  For it is evident our stronger perceptions or impressions are innate, and that natural affection, love of virtue, resentment, and all the other passions, arise immediately from nature.  I am perswaded, whoever would take the question in this light, would be easily able to reconcile all parties.  Father Malebranche would find himself at a loss to point out any thought of the mind, which did not represent something antecedently felt by it, whether internally, or by means of the external senses, and must allow, that however we may compound, and mix, and augment, and diminish our ideas, they are all derived from these sources.  Mr. Locke, on the other hand, would readily acknowledge, that all our passions are a kind of natural instincts, derived from nothing but the original constitution of the human mind. (Treatise SBN 647-648)   Note, like Leibniz would in his New Essays, and essentially for the same reason, Hume argues against a categorical distinction between empiricist and rationalist epistemology, and blames the appearance of such a distinction on an error of Locke's!  These kinds of impressions, derived ""internally"" or from ""the original constitution of the human mind"", play a really important role in Hume's epistemology, especially in the naturalist interpretation which has gained popularity through the twentieth century, in which they are the lever which gets the Humean out of skepticism and into realism about, notably, (i) causal inferences, (ii) the existence of the external world and its similarity to our perceptions, and (iii) moral distinctions.  And I think likewise this is going to mitigate against any attempts to reject Hume as the kind of simple empiricist which is really the idea of empiricism Hume rejects as being an artifact of an error of Locke's.  Though, in any case, I don't think the objection of self-refutation is particularly plausible here at face: for Hume, it would seem, the ""fork"" is a ""matter of fact"".  Incidentally, his attitude toward metaphysics is also more nuanced than the common view depicts.  He doesn't seem to think that metaphysics must be a matter consigned to the flames, but rather--apparently--a matter approached carefully via the experimental method and tempered with a limited kind of skepticism.  Here's Hume:   By metaphysical reasonings, they... [understand] every kind of argument, which is any way abstruse, and requires some attention to be comprehended.  We have so often lost our labour in such researches, that we commonly reject them without hesitation, and resolve, if we must for ever be a prey to errors and delusions, that they shall at least be natural and entertaining.  And indeed nothing but the most determined scepticism, along with a great degree of indolence, can justify this aversion to metaphysics.  For if truth be at all within the reach of human capacity, 'tis certain it must lie very deep and abstruse; and to hope we shall arrive at it without pains, while the greatest geniuses have failed with the utmost pains, must certainly be esteemed sufficiently vain and presumptuous.  I pretend no such advantage in the philosophy I am going to unfold, and would esteem it a strong presumption against it, were it so very easy and obvious. (Treatise SBN xiv-xv)   Note, he here associates his philosophy in the Treatise with metaphysics, rather than against it.  A lengthier explanation this relation he takes his work to have to metaphysics can be found in the first chapter of the first Enquiry.  Regarding logical positivism, this business about ""meaningfulness"" has a narrower, and more technical significance than we're inclined to take it if we interpret this word colloquially.  An expression that is meaningless, in the logical positivist sense of being outside the scope of the verification criterion, is not therefore an expression that we should not assert, nor even an expression which has no significant role to play in our theorizing.  Rather, ""meaningfulness"" here has the technical sense provided by the verification criterion, that a statement is meaningful when it admits of some procedure of verification.  But other kinds of statements, those which do not admit of such a procedure, are still sometimes really important statements--even statements really important to our scientific theorizing.  Carnap, who's probably the most important source for logical positivist epistemology, gives two senses in which propositions which are meaningless in this sense nonetheless play important roles for us.  The first is an expressivist role.  Some of the things we say, according to Carnap, are meaningless in this sense, but still play an important role in expressing our ""life-feeling"".  This is essentially a kind of artistic function, but one which Carnap recognizes plays an important role in our lives.  On this point, see the last section of his Elimination of Metaphysics.  But he also sees some propositions, meaningless in this sense, as playing an important role not only in our lives, but also in our scientific theorizing.  These are expressions which establish the framework for our empirical and/or logical investigations.  A very important part of Carnap's epistemology is this idea that the framework that makes such investigations possible is not simple a given, in experience or logically, but rather must be construed a certain way in order for investigation to proceed--and indeed, that this is the traditional task of metaphysics.  Carnap calls propositions that fill this role, propositions about ""external questions"" (in the language of Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology, the classic source for this idea).  Such propositions are meaningless, in the technical sense that they are unverifiable, but they are nonetheless indispensable for scientific theorizing, since they establish the grounds for such theorizing to occur.  Carnap thinks of these propositions as being warranted on ""practical"" rather than ""theoretical"" grounds--thus there might be better or worse or more or less expedient answers to ""external questions"", but there aren't truth or false answers, since these propositions are unverifiable.  So, in this way Carnap, and logical positivism generally, has a more nuanced approach to metaphysics, which is not simply consigned to the Humean flames, but rather gets reinterpreted, indeed in a powerful way, in the particular context of logical positivist epistemology.  A good source for scholarship trying to reintroduce these details of the logical positivist position, and correct the common wisdom, is Friedman's Logical Positivism Reconsidered.  And this nuance mitigates against the charge of self-refutation.  For the verification criterion indeed does seem to be meaningless, in the logical positivist sense, but this does not make dispensable, or the kind of thing we should not assent to--that conclusion requires us to misunderstand the logical positivist notion of meaningfulness on merely colloquial grounds.  The verification criterion becomes perhaps one of Carnap's ""practical"" or ""external"" matters--an expedient warranted on the basis of its establishing the conditions for scientific inquiry.  Neurath in particular gives an extended defense of logical positivism on these kinds of grounds."

Ayer's book is infamously somewhat vulgarizing of the thought of the Vienna Circle; one would get a clearer picture of the thought of the Vienna Circle by reading Carnap, Schlick, Neurath, or recent scholarship on them from people like Michael Freidman or Richard Creath.   Also I think that claiming that any statement is meaningless but useful is an abuse of English.   The distinction that Carnap makes in Elimination of Metaphysics (which was written of course in German) between expressive and theoretical functions, or in Semantics, Empiricism, and Ontology between internal/theoretical and external/practical questions is a distinction well-founded in the philosophical tradition he's working, following from the foundational work of Kant, and having been recently elaborated, when Carnap wrote, especially in the traditions of neo-Kantianism and Lebensphilosophie, which where Carnap's influences on this point.  If you have a merely semantic objection to how these claims sound relative to a colloquial understanding of English (even setting aside for the moment that thinking of these distinctions entirely through the category of meaninglessness is an artifact of reading Carnap through Ayer's vulgarization, while Carnap himself often expressed the point in different terms), I don't really see how that will get us to a substantial objection to the philosophical doctrines themselves.

If you mean to suggest that Carnap's notion of the expressive function in Elimination of Metaphysics and his notion of external questions in Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology are ""far outside the pale of LP-ism"", then surely you're mistaken, for these are canonical texts of logical positivism--if there's a conflict between our understanding of logical positivism and the content of Carnap's canonical works, it's the former that has to give way, not the latter.

I was not reporting an idiosyncratic opinion of my own, but rather the typical view in the scholarship.  For instance, here's Friedman:  ""Extracted from the German intellectual tradition constituting their original philosophical context, the positivists now became identified with a rather simpleminded version of radical empiricism. Indeed, this process had already begun in earnest with the publication of A.J. Ayer's (1936) extraordinarily influential popularization of the logical positivist movement, Language, Truth, and Logic."" (Reconsidering Logical Positivism, xiv)  The passage continues by making the same point I have, associating the interpretation of verificationism, and the centrality of charges of meaninglessness to this interpretation, like that expressed in the OP's video and implied by your own remarks with this popularization and loss of context.  Friedman: ""At the very center of positivist thought, according to this picture, is the notorious principle of verifiability, the principle that only propositions having direct implications for sensory experience are 'cognitively meaningful'. All other propositions, not only those of traditional metaphysics, but also those of ethics and religion, for example, are now declared devoid of meaning...  It is no wonder, then, that logical positivism, so characterized and identified, provoked an extreme, one might even say violent, reaction, not only within professional philosophy but also within the humanities more generally...  Nevertheless, as scholarly investigations of the past fifteen or twenty years into the origins of logical empiricism have increasingly revealed, such a simpleminded radically empiricist picture of this movement is seriously distorted. Our understanding of logical positivism and its intellectual significance must be fundamentally revised when we reinsert the positivists into their original intellectual context..."" (xiv-xv)"

Perhaps this is a bad claim. Perhaps ethicists should only claim to produce Howard Cosells (commentators who never played the sport) rather than improved players of the game.   Your view of teaching ethics-as-content may not be the right approach. Ethics courses might benefit from a component which shows students how to actually develop phronesis (e.g., lessons on how to develop moral habits, methods for engaging in moral reasoning under time constraints and emotional distress).   As for your claim about the alleged umbrella of Aristotle, Aristotle can account for the discrepancy only for those ethicists and ethical systems which are compatible with him. For those who believe that ethics amounts to nothing more than finding the morally correct action in a situation (combined with the belief that this knowledge is, more or less, all one needs to be a moral actor), the Aristotelian caveat offers no excuse or cover.

Should we be surprised that when that when these students transition into becoming teachers they are as flabby as practitioners as their students?   Approaching ethics as a body of knowledge rather than a lived practice certainly does not seem to position us well as coaches. A guy like Bob Costas, to stick with the sporting example, can do a great job describing a sporting event, but he's not a coach. He knows nothing about coaching, although he may know quite a bit about the sports for which he provide commentary. One would be ill-advised to seek coaching from Bob.   You are correct that a great coach need not be a great athlete, but a great coach has to do more than draw Xs and Os and simply describe a sport as an objective body of knowledge. But this is what ethics classes do. They draw up the Xs and Os of philosophical positions, noting arguments, objections, strengths, and weaknesses.   Finally, we should mark a distinction. If we take a great coach and put him/her against a great athlete, odds are she/he will fail miserably. There is no shame in an ethicist coming up short compared to a moral saint, a world class ethical practitioner. On the other hand, we would expect that someone with a deep knowledge of a sport to perform better, all things being equal, than a non-athlete. I would expect that a thirty-year-old hockey coach in good health would be better, on average, than a thirty-year-old non-hockey player in good health, because the coach would have a deep understanding of the principles of the game and the techniques appropriate to applying these principles. Likewise, one would hope (especially since this is all we teach), that a person exposed to the theories of ethics would be a better, on average, than your non-ethicist. It is in this sense that we expect knowledge to have causal properties and to confer advantages to learners. If ethicists do not really outperform the common person, then yes this is an embarrassment."

Less jokingly, this might be a good place to voice a suspicion I have. I'm not very familiar with ethics, certainly not analytic ethics, so I can't say this with any confidence. It's no more than a slight suspicion. That said, I'm somewhat weirded out by the, seemingly common, talk of moral facts, and moral truths. It seems to me ethics is fundamentally a meddling discipline, as it were, an area of thinking that is supposed, not so much to just find out true things, but to point fingers. It is prescriptive, in the sense that it judges you or how you behave, and tells you how to behave. But this talk of moral facts seem almost to transform it into a descriptive discipline that tries to discover truths in a more or less disinterested way; it just so happens that the truths it discovers are prescriptive truths. But there is still there a distance between ethics as an academic discipline, and ethics as a prescription of how to behave. And I'm not sure whether such a distance is desirable.  And as another thought, if I'm not too wrong here, I wonder if perhaps this is the origin of discussions about the motivational force of ethics. I suppose that as a philosophical discussion it is not merely concerned with whether people actually, in a psychological sense, desire to be moral, but rather with whether the truth of some moral fact is itself a reason, for a rational person, to behave in a certain way. It seems to me such a discussion could only arise if moral facts are precisely such 'distant' truths, instead of direct, perhaps personal, judgements."

The section with the mention of the behaviors they asked ethicists/non-ethicists about is well above the fold.  You didn't even skim the damn article.  This occurred shortly after carriage return number 16:   Obviously some of these measures are more significant than others. They range from comparative trivialities (littering) to substantial life decisions (joining the Nazis), and from contributions to strangers (blood donation) to personal interactions (calling Mom). Some of our measures rely on self-report (we didn’t ask ethicists’ mothers how long it had really been).   The relevant section is less than 1/3 of the article down:   Nonetheless, ethicists do embrace more stringent moral norms on some issues, especially vegetarianism and charitable donation. Our results on vegetarianism were particularly striking. In a survey of professors from five US states, we found that 60 per cent of ethicist respondents rated ‘regularly eating the meat of mammals, such as beef or pork’ somewhere on the ‘morally bad’ side of a nine-point scale ranging from ‘very morally bad’ to ‘very morally good’. By contrast, only 19 per cent of non-philosophy professors rated it as bad. That’s a pretty big difference of opinion! Non-ethicist philosophers were intermediate, at 45 per cent. But when asked later in the survey whether they had eaten the meat of a mammal at their last evening meal, we found no statistically significant difference in the groups’ responses – about 38 per cent of professors from all groups reported having done so (including 37 per cent of ethicists).

Of course, it is true that it's a rather targeted question... But the question of meat and the global industries which distribute it is one of the largest ethical questions of the 21st century.

It's an interesting behavior to look at, though, partly because there's such a disparity in percentage of the population who take it to be unethical between ethicists and non-ethicists (and yet not much of a disparity in the percentage who actually do it).  The common feature of the behaviors they studied is not that they are all obviously (un)ethical. It's that they are behaviors that would commonly (though to varying degrees) be taken to involve ethical decisions; people will disagree (again, to varying degrees, depending on the behavior) on whether the behavior is ethical or not, but will at least largely agree that there is a question of ethics involved in deciding whether to engage in it. The point of the empirical research is then not just to take these as obviously unethical behaviors and rate people as more or less ethical based on how often they engage in them. Rather, one wants to look at differences between ethicists and non-ethicists both in how they feel about the ethics of the questions and in how often they engage in them. That is, the question is not ""are ethicists more or less likely to engage in this set of behaviors that I've labeled as unethical"", but rather ""are ethicists more or less likely to engage in behaviors that they themselves believe are unethical"". If, as the article claims, ethicists are much more likely than other philosophers or laypeople to agree that eating meat is unethical, but no less likely to actually eat meat, one needn't take a stance on the ethical question itself to conclude that ethicists are not significantly more likely than non-ethicists to behave ethically (by their own standards)."

How, for example, could not voting possibly be construed as unethical? While this is an interesting study problem they've set out to investigate, I think this particular manner of questions don't really do much to actually answer the question they set out to address.  It's kind of like asking how politically engaged are political science professors? Then asking them about how big of a tip they give at restaurants, it doesn't really have anything to do with the study question."

philosophy,3d9ie9,LibertyLizard,2,Tue Jul 14 18:41:27 2015 UTC,"Yup, you're right, I read the article quickly and didn't read the rest of that paragraph.  At least 60% of ethicists vs. 19% of professors realized that eating meat was a moral bad though. On issues like that where there are intense societal pressures to conform, then I don't know how much we should chastise individuals for not following through on their beliefs.  It's pretty easy to act morally when your moral theories are in line with societal beliefs, but when acting morally takes a rather large commitment I think we can view this less of a problem of personal ethics and more of a society wide problem.  As someone committed to animal rights theory and who has been a vegetarian for a long time, I feel more sympathy to the meat eater who recognizes the immorality of eating animals but isn't up to the task of making huge life changes than I am to the vegetarian who refrains from meat for non-ethical reasons. Animal rights activism that focuses too heavily on vegetarianism is in my mind a mistake, because it turns what is a huge societal problem into a matter of individual choice. Real change will come not from goofballs like me who are willing to rearrange their diets to be ethically consistent with their views, but from people who eat meat and find vegetarianism too much of a radical change, but understand that animals are due rights and thus begin to gradually rework society to be more animal friendly.  Sorry this has little to do with your comment but I used your correction of my previous statement as an excuse to ramble."
philosophy,3d9ie9,kochevnikov,1 point,Tue Jul 14 22:44:25 2015 UTC,"Interesting points. I agree with a lot of what you said. I personally have made huge efforts in my life to live in a more environmentally friendly way, but I feel like in a lot of ways people judge me for it, because it goes against societal norms. And it makes people feel guilty because they don't live that way. It's really a lot more difficult than most people think to go against that. To be honest I've fallen back on a lot of my previous commitments because it's just hard to be judged all the time for trying to do the right thing. Especially when it's actually highly inconvenient to me to do so. So I think you're right.  That said, you would still expect ethicists to do at least a little better than their peers, no? I mean in order to overcome those pressures, you have to spend time considering and working past them. Something Ethicists would, I think, be more able to do since their moral weight of actions is something they contemplate frequently. So it is interesting to me that this is not the case.

I think there is an implicit argumentum ad hominem behind the motivation of this study in the fashion of ""Who are you to talk about ethics if you're not ethical yourself?"". This is an instance of an argumentum ad hominem, as I said, which is a known logical fallacy.

The content of any ethical discussion is what one ought to do, so surely what the professors are doing is at least a little relevant? You say it's more of a sociological finding, but that's reifying academic boundaries that, in this case, aren't useful--it's a social finding, which is exactly why it's relevant to the discussion of ethics: because ethics is about people acting a certain way, and people acting is an inescapably social thing."

Relevant to what? To their evaluation as persons? Of course. One might legitimately call them unethical or hypocritical based on their words and deeds. But science (and I daresay that philosophy is a science) is not about persons, it's about theories. If Kant turned out to be a cruel person, that wouldn't invalidate his theory of the categorical impartive. The purpose of ethics as a branch of philosophy is not to makes people act better, but to understand what morality is and provide a theoretical basis of how to debate ethical questions rationally. One might excel in that while he doesn't in acting ethically, just like one might excel in aesthetics without being an excellent artist. And while the fact how people act and how they ought to act are related, they are not related in such a way that you can draw conclusions from the latter to the former."

To recap Haigdht -  liberals have a narrow set of moral considerations that they regard as properly moral - namely harm to others and fairness - while conservatives include considerations of purity, fidelity and other things.  Liberals dont think that masturbation is a moral issue because it doesn't harm/help others nor does it reflect any inequity between persons.   If the researchers are surveying a liberal population like ethicists, they should expect that these people will only regard a narrow set of issues as properly moral - so including things like voting behavior is not likely to reflect their moral selves.  Perhaps ethicists do perform better than non-ethicists when making decisions that they consider morally relevant but care perform ""worse"" on issues they do not consider to be properly moral.  This would be an efficient way to conserve energy and patience for the things that really matter.

Considering most serious evil is institutional and not this kind of petty one-off stuff, all these measures they sampled are superficial, imo.  What makes humanity intolerable, for example, is an institution of ownership.  It's a big one.  Which leads to greed.  Opposing it by making personal donations is insanity.  It's like opposing slavery by setting your own slaves free.  It makes no sense, especially if you first have to buy slaves (creating demand) prior to setting them free.  Someone who beats people up but is against slavery as an institution is superior to someone polite, who holds the door, and never beats their slaves.  A rude person can be ethically very good, and a very polite and smooth and tactful person can be a monster.  I hear Hitler was very cultured in all the petty ways they ""sampled"", but at an institutional level he apparently was a monster.  I bet he wrote to his mother and donated and all that.  What people have trouble understanding is that a corporate CEO can do more evil with a stroke of a pen than a serial rapist doing the one-by-one rapings.  The greatest evil is impersonal and highly efficient and organized.  It's not the kind of stuff people have to get into your face about.  A petty thief who gets in your face can only steal 100 bucks or whatnot.  A bankster can steal millions or billions with just a pen or a keyboard.  It's not even close.

The requirements of justice concern the rights that must be respected in every case, whereas goods may be contingent upon particular conceptions of what is meaningful/desirable for a given culture, community, or individual. What is right is right for everyone, whereas what is good might only be good for you based on your other desires/commitments. As long as what is good does not conflict with the baseline of the right, then justice has nothing more to say about it (the good is 'within' the right in this sense).  The distinction is important for establishing a deontic metaethical and normative framework. Habermas mentions it throughout his works. For Rawls, this quote might suffice.   On the veil of ignorance: ""...no one knows his place in society, his class position or social status, nor does anyone know his fortune in the distribution of natural assets and abilities, his intelligence, strength, and the like.

The list of the ethically you-are-good-if-you-do-these is a fairly debatable list, but what's really concerning is the whole concept of shoulding.  That problem with what we should or ought to do seems eerily similar to our reaction to advice or commands from others.  If we're told as kids to clean our rooms (or likewise feel that we should clean them), our reactions become either submissive or rebellious (assuming we give the advice credence in the first place).  Neither of these responses take into account what we'd like to do, and so because they don't, they're inherently unstable and will fail over time.  The measure of good in the case of ""shoulding"" is external rather than internal.  Until it's determined for ourselves what is truly good, keeping the course steady will be a challenge."
philosophy,3dh4eu,rjosephhoffmann,13,Thu Jul 16 05:52:19 2015 UTC,"For a piece so strongly titled, you spend an awful lot of time giving credit to your nominal targets.  The basic premise of the 'atheo-scientific' argument is 'hard to quarrel with', and their physicalist sympathies are founded on 'the best of intentions'.  Further, the central folly of these folks is that 'anyone who possesses special knowledge of this world is in a privileged position compared to those who do not possess such knowledge.'  Gee, where do I sign up?    I'm going to be inherently suspicious of anyone as accredited as you telling me that having special knowledge should not give me some kind of privilege over those who lack it.    I apologize for the snark, but mixing up 'solipsism' and 'syllogism' does not give me confidence that you're any more of an expert than I am."

What struck me as well was the ""god of the gaps"" type of argument that was presented later in that science did not (yet) explain conscience, the why of there is an existence as opposed to nothing, etc.  However, this is the exact challenge that science in itself takes on. He places too much emphasis on the new atheists not pointing out that math is in the realm of pure thought while not himself understanding that it is just a tool to arrive at the fact and not the fact itself.  5/10 for effort."

For their part, the atheist cohort believe they are doing just fine, thank you very much, without knowing any of these things, because (after all) they are getting the right answers without having had to wade through philosophical mud and theological twaddle. History? It’s just stuff that gets written down.   Yeah, ok, whatever.  Athiests don't care about history and that makes all their arguments flawed?  That's the pivot of your argument?  I had a very hard time with his assumption that poets and philosophers were equivalent to theologians and antithetical to scientists.  Where is the justification for this assumption?  I imagine philosophers to be equally divided between those who appreciate theology and myth and those who appreciate scientific relativism.  Poets aren't even in the same category and comprise everyone from Paul (of the bible) to Dawkins himself, who writes beautiful and elegant prose that I would call poetry at times.  Having slogged through a dozen paragraphs without encountering an argument that wasn't based in ad hominem typecasting of the gargoyles that fill the ranks of popular scientists, I stopped reading and decided my time would be better spent writing a brief post here.

The error of this argument is that it fails to recognize the naturalist claim that every human mental faculty originates in brain tissue. No one doubts that our species is uniquely (on this planet) equipped with certain faculties, or that many human pursuits besides hard science are worthy.

philosophy,3dh4eu,jo-ha-kyu,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:56:41 2015 UTC,"I have separate issues with each. Krauss I find to be particularly obnoxious in his denegration of almost everything that is not hard science, his tendency to raise his voice and talk on at great length whenever his ideas are challenged in a debating situation, and the general shallowness of his philosophical ideas. Example of the latter: he seems to think his book, A Universe from Nothing, solves the riddle of existence, but he takes as given the regularities of quantum physics, which certainly is not nothing.  I won't rattle on with my complaints against the others I mentioned."
philosophy,3dh4eu,Ernst_Mach,2,Fri Jul 17 02:25:13 2015 UTC,"To be fair, to arrive at a nothing it must be contrasted with something. In essence since its definition is based on something else, you can argue that nothing is a nonsensical concept when it comes to matter, space, and time. To Krauss, nothing means space void of energy, and its this definition he goes by."
philosophy,3dh4eu,hazah-order,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:34:01 2015 UTC,"Nothing, which is not encountered in reality, is a difficult concept. To argue that it is nonsense, however, takes up a heavy burden of proof. The great riddles of existence are why anything at all exists and why what exists is the way it is and not some other way (neither of which, I maintain, can ever be answered). Krauss does not address these questions, but deflects attention to a much less interesting question to which he has an answer.  He does not answer why an empty space that happens to satisfy the currently understood quantum regularities would ever exist."
philosophy,3dh4eu,Ernst_Mach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:43:43 2015 UTC,"you can argue that nothing is a nonsensical concept when it comes to matter, space, and time.   I never meant that one can argue against it without the context I provided. Specifically referring to material cosmology.   why what exists is the way it is and not some other way (neither of which, I maintain, can ever be answered).   Never say never, they say. String Theory provides a compelling explanation for the cosmic landscape that allows our specific configuration. OT though :(.   Krauss does not address these questions, but deflects attention to a much less interesting question to which he has an answer.   They aren't applicable to him and the only reason he is ever asked these is because either he or the asker is stepping outside of their elements.  In physics, the concept of nothing is the absence of properties in a region of space (energy). The observation is that the more energy you drain from a region of space, the more sporadically that space behaves (retaining the uncertainty principle). So the conclusion is that we cannot get a physical system consisting of nothing -- hence I said nonsensical. Therefore we must be open to the notion that nothing as such belongs to the realm of the abstract, and it potentially does not have a parallel in the physical world. It's reasonable to suggest that this line of reasoning about matter/space/energy is actually to bark up the wrong tree. But that does not mean that nothing itself, conceptually, is nonsensical. I wouldn't be making that argument, ever."
philosophy,3dh4eu,hazah-order,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:55:14 2015 UTC,"I did not utter the first statement that you quote, so I have no obligation to defend it.  That the regularities of this world are most easily accounted for by string theory is a possible result of physics. Why the world is that way and not some other way is not a possible result of physics; nor is why anything exists at all.  You're misusing nonsense.   we cannot get a physical system consisting of nothing.   If nothing were nonsense, this statement would be nonsense. The statement most particularly does not deny that alternative physics might have prevailed, characterized by universal nothingness."
philosophy,3dh4eu,Ernst_Mach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:38:27 2015 UTC,"I quoted myself to point out that I did not make a bare statement. My proposal was that the ""Why"" in terms of physics is what is nonsensical, ie it's possible that the physical world is itself is either uncaused or is co-dependently caused (two or more causes in a feedback loop that allows for recreation), which would mean that asking the question will not yield results in any philosophical system of thought.  The whole thing becomes even more problematic to reason about because we've yet to define what, if anything can be said to actually exist in the first place. We don't have a solid definition for what something is (other than energy, which is... what exactly? Potential to do work is an abstract thought, not substance, not an object). And so, what are we contrasting against, specifically to get at nothing?    The statement most particularly does not deny that alternative physics might have prevailed, characterized by universal nothingness.   While my statement doesn't, Quantum Mechanics certainly does preclude this type of universe. Empty space will never have 0 energy, as this violates the uncertainty principle."

That is just not the essence. Religion can be helpful, can guide people to better existence, it's just that believers cannot force their views on people who are unable to accept the dogma upon which their whole system of values is ultimately built on. Alas, people don't ofter argue to find the truth, but to prove others wrong, which infliates the ego - and that, the very possibility that religion can be used as a lever to force your values upon others for the pleasure of feeling right is what is truly terrifying in belief."
philosophy,3dh4eu,Adurell,4,Sat Jul 18 07:55:11 2015 UTC,So this is a claim that atheo-scientism is hurting philosophy or is producing a philosophy without acknowledging it? And so what to either one? The primary lesson to take away from people such as Krauss and Harris is that they want people to learn how to question their beliefs. Once you understand your own decision making process and the result of that behavior you can then modify or refine your beliefs via scientific or testifiable reasoning.

philosophy,3dh4eu,eaturbrainz,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:33:40 2015 UTC,"Science is cool and explains the physical world better than anything else.   A lot of science seems to have no explanatory content at all. For example, Archimedes' laws of levers or Newton's laws, are just maths. In effect, they tell us how to do things, but that makes them something like recipes. I guess recipes could be characterised as explanations of how cookery works, but cookery is a human activity and so are the things that science functions a recipes for, so no such science explains the physical world, as far as I can see.   Of course there are cases in which science functions within an explanatory framework, for example, atomic theory involves stories about atoms and the rules by which they can combine with each other, and this allows us to write more recipes. However, amongst others, Chang has argued against taking these stories over-seriously. He points out that there are situations where phlogiston theory of combustion is more useful than atomic theory. So, if we judge science as doing something better than other ways of doing that thing by the usefulness of the recipes we get from scientists, the truth or otherwise of any attached explanatory story doesn't seem to be very important. Fictionalism works fine.   On the other hand, what does it mean to say that ""science is cool""? Presumably nothing like this, I read often enough that some discovery or observation is ""cool"", but I never have any idea what the author could mean by it."
philosophy,3dh4eu,ughaibu,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:03:49 2015 UTC,"I think that is an unfair generalization. Certainly there are limits to knowledge and certainty, and philosophical discussion on the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of those limits is important. However, when it comes to nature, objectivity is EXTREMELY important. Observations, if they are to be of any use, makes no contribution to a consistent understanding of the universe if they could not be agreed upon. Objectivity is often very difficult to ascertain, as it is only by consensus that we agree that ""yes, this happens"". It is with an amount of inductive certainty that we accept particular facts as objectively true."
philosophy,3dh4eu,AboveDisturbing,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:15:42 2015 UTC,"Yes but look at psychology - extremely useful and important, but the criteria isn't measureable. The results are measurable, but the actual content of what is happening in your mind is 100% subjective.  There is no test for how you bring up a difficult memory, for how exactly you recognize and reintegrate a projection, or conceptualize your shadow elements.   Yet, it works very very well, and has relieved so much confusion and suffering throughout the world.   Your average scientist (and atheo-science-fan) these days feels compelled to say psychology really isn't science.  That's because they want to reduce everything to the 3rd person objective injunction.  Math, logic, and psychology will always require the subjective injunction - you can use pencil and paper all you want - the verification comes from multiple people performing the subjective injunction in their heads, coming together and verifying their results."
philosophy,3dh4eu,EverythingMakesSense,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"I think your response is on par. Psychology is an empirical science. Hypotheses can be made and tested. Quantitative analysis of data is extremely important in forming conclusions. I think psychology gets flak because of its history. Freud's methods were certainly not grounded in rigorous scientific scrutiny.  You will have reductionists who will argue that psychology comes down to neurobiology, but that seems to be false. Often, psychology has borrowed from a functionalist perspective. It is quite common for psychology to be interdisciplinary with an medical understanding of the brain's functions.  Your last part is the most interesting. It really is an epistemological problem. We obviously do not have ""access"" (or whatever you might call it) directly to objective reality. We must use subjective means to come about understanding an objective truth. Even then that understanding might not be absolute or perfect, we are still bound to induction.  I'm also an atheist with a deep interest in science. I feel that many others like me have a perspective similar to what is presented in this article. It lacks depth."

Science is Pragmatic, in that it keeps working even when you don't ""believe in it"".  The properly scientific spirit is not, ""Lecture on theoretical framework now, then pass to underlying metaphysical and philosophical framework"", but instead ""Set up experiment now, do experiments, figure out what sorts of theories we can rule in or out, and be very careful about making philosophical statements before knowing what present or future science can rule in or out."""

Scientism is an imperialistic attitude of science regarding fields like philosophy. Atheism is more of a philosophical position than one that should be attributed to science. I think that's one glaring reason why ""scientism"" is bad; because when a scientist and pop-science author like Krauss or Dawkins makes public statements or writes about philosophy as being somehow obsolete, they are ignoring that they are in some sense doing philosophy. The God Delusion, for example, could be described as ""pop-philosophy"". Having read it, I would say it was like Dawkins sat down to write an undergrad essay on philosophy of religion by ignoring almost everything that would be included in a philosophy of religion class. Yet he criticizes philosophy as if he has ignored nothing, and portrays philosophy as only defending religion for criticizing his arguments against religion. Part of the reason why this is so arrogant and irrational is how they represent atheism. Especially bad is that they both produce bad philosophy and criticize philosophy.   To group atheism with scientism, suggesting that their atheism is a problem, I think misses the point that what is wrong with scientism is that it undermines the conditions for debating about issues like the existence of God in philosophy of religion. Atheism is the philosophical part of what Dawkins, Krauss, Harris, and the like, have said or argued.

philosophy,3dg8m6,Sword_of_Apollo,3,Thu Jul 16 01:35:04 2015 UTC,"I've listened to this, and I think it's a really excellent interview. I left a comment on the blog page just this evening that hasn't been moderator-approved yet.  Here's a copy of it:   Great interview!  Matt and Dunnan (I think that's his name, it was difficult to make out.) did a great job in asking pertinent questions, and Greg Salmieri gave excellent answers. This episode is absolutely packed with great, clarifying points on Ayn Rand's philosophy.  I have spent years studying (and blogging about) Ayn Rand's philosophy, which is much deeper and richer than many people give her credit for. While her advocacy of ethical/rational egoism is well known, the actual arguments behind her ethics (meta-ethics) is much less known, and not studied by most.  In fact, most mentions of her ethical views don't even acknowledge many of her normative ethical points. Namely, that she advocated certain definite virtues as constituting rationality in the pursuit of genuine self-interest (survival par excellence, which is flourishing or happiness.) She advocated the virtues of: honesty, integrity, productiveness, justice, independence, and pride.  This interview does a good job at fulfilling the title of the podcast: it elucidates Ayn Rand's ethics, to the extent possible in such a short time.  Another thing worth mentioning is that Ayn Rand's ethics depends in key ways on her epistemological views, especially her theory of concepts, which she presents in Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology. For Rand, ethical knowledge and concepts are subsets of knowledge and concepts, more generally. They don't have any kind of unique status that fundamentally separates them from other areas of knowledge. So, as Dr. Salmieri indicates, a critical part of her case for her ethics is an analysis of the proper meaning of concepts like ""life"" and ""value.""  Thanks again for the great podcast,  Eric M.

philosophy,3dg8m6,cunningjames,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:57:23 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed this podcast.  I have read a limited amount of Rand's writing, and had enjoyed it, but I suffered from many of the misconceptions mentioned in the podcast.  I find her definition of selfishness and the goal of creating value to be quite coherent and rational.  It feels like she took a touch of Nietzsche and expounded it.  I also agree with her idea of contempt and putting ""philosophers, politicians, etc."" in the position of being responsible.  That is something that the average Joe can understand and yet feel endlessly frustrated by.  In theory, it works to try to mold the system and call it to account or place blame, but throughout history and up to this day, it hasn't proved tremendously efficient.  I would say that a better theory on governance and the words/deeds/precedents of the authorities, whether they be academic or political, is a good question for philosophy.  What other options do we have when facing this frustration?  Perhaps Rand answers this in the context of creating value.  Perhaps we need to up the ante."

philosophy,3d7so9,AddemF,3,Wed Jul 15 02:25:52 2015 UTC,Does anyone have any suggestions on his books that address arguments against fine tuning? I have heard what seem like home run arguments against it but he really only address multiverse and claims ultimate victory on that point. Curious as to his writing about it.
philosophy,3d7so9,throwawayforsex555,2,Wed Jul 15 11:41:46 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any books, but yeah, to my mind Fine Tuning seems weak since we have no way of knowing that other physical constants wouldn't also have given rise to other sorts of life.  While these particular physical constants might be unlikely (although, actually, I'm not even convinced that thinking about probability or possibility here even makes sense--what's the probability distribution of the physical constants and how do we know?) to say that life itself is unlikely assumes that life only occurs with these constants."
philosophy,3d7so9,AddemF,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:34:16 2015 UTC,"Indeed. Seems to me in order for fine tuning to succeed we have to assume first that the constants even could be different at all, which we don't know. Then we have to assume that it's somehow less likely that life like outs would come about. Which we can't know, perhaps our constants are towards the least conducive for life side of the possible spectrum (if there is one at all). Then it seems to me, we also have to assume that other forms of significant life could not arise. All of these seem incredibly untenable in conjunction with the fact that only a small part of this one particular planet sustains life so far yet the entire universe is supposedly find tuned for us. Not to mention the larger problem of evil when he claims this whole place as ""good"". Good maybe if you're a white Christian philosophy professor of religion but maybe not so much when you were born as an African child and your entire year of existence consisted of a slow starvation and then death. /rant."
philosophy,3d7so9,throwawayforsex555,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:05:20 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of that, although I think the problem of evil is a separate issue.  About the problem of evil, Trent Dougherty (the interviewer) has elsewhere argued that the evil we experience may be a part of the best possible world.  For instance, it is easy to imagine another world in which nothing exists and therefore it has less evil (namely, no evil) but yet this world is less good than our own because some of the evil in our world is over-compensated for by the good that's here.  So the suggestion goes, it may be that any world with less evil than our own will--by force of the network of all other things in our world that would logically and physically be different in the counterfactual--actually be less good.  It seems to me that's a coherent argument, but I have little trust in the idea that all of the evil we experience was unavoidable in order to make logical or physical space for a greater over-compensating good.  As a mere conjecture I don't think much could possibly rule it out or rule it in."
philosophy,3d7so9,emptyheady,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:42:30 2015 UTC,"I agree, I generally use the problem of evil merely as a counter balance to assertions of a ""good world"". In this instance he asserted it as a given and thus I would just assert the problem of evil with the same level of reinforcement he used. I think there's a good bit still to discuss in the problem of evil but it's highly dependant on what sect we are taking and the claims they make.  Edit: a word."

I think Swinburne is talking about the development of the formal study of religion under the umbrella of philosophy, rather than a separate entity. It's not that philosophy developed into something different, just the way many people categorized and viewed religion and philosophy.  Religion, as he is presenting it, was a separate study from Philosophy for much of the world. I used to see philosophy and religion as separate.

One issue I do see is that our way of automating plant reproduction would rely on our industrial economy staying strong, whereas bees' method is done on an individual basis. In other words if human society has a regression of sorts (e.g. via some near-armageddon event or a general decline in civilization akin to how Roman civilization transitioned into the Dark Ages), we would suddenly lose our ability/need to automate plant reproduction, potentially wiping out plants and thus all of life.

For starters, the evolutionary incentive for sexual selection is just too strong to assume it doesn't happen. Even though we humans find it easy to think of the bees as ""deciding"" which plants pollinate which, but that's not really what's going on. Bees just go get pollen; consciously, that's probably all they care about. By 'designing' how their flowers grow (etc), plants can 'choose' which bees pick up their pollen and therefore which plants they pollinate (or which plants pollinate them). That the choice is not made by a conscious brain is irrelevant, especially since the philosophical nature of consciousness is all so dubious.

A few examples: Ravens, coyotes, foxes that depredate bird nests like the sage grouse. Barred owls that use the same old growth as spotted owls. The way an ecosystem works, though, is that when you cull a predator, often the next generation will have a better chance of survival due to reduced inter and intraspecific competition. It's basically impossible to cull all individuals that may be predators. Many ecosystems are so radically different from what would be naturally occurring that it is impossible to conserve species (and individuals) as would have been found naturally. The community has shifted so much but a layperson doesn't understand that in a lot of cases you can't simply reintroduce an extirpated population or cull predators to fix it. It's incredibly difficult to go back to a previous iteration of an ecosystem.   Individuals of a species are paying the price for conservation, in most cases because they're adept at persisting in the anthropogenically altered ecosystem."

The best example in the US is the northern spotted owl. It was originally thought that the species was declining due to a loss in old growth forest. While the loss of old growth forest due to logging. It is now widely accepted that the major reason for spotted owl decline is competition with the invasive yet genetically very similar barred owl. The second most accepted reason for spotted owl decline is habitat loss due to large, intense fires. Logging probably does play some role but it is mostly accepted as a distant third place, if that.  Another interesting aspect of species protection is misatribution of harm. It's very common for environmentalists to seek strict protection of species in one venue while totally ignoring the much larger source of harm. A great example of this is salmon protection in the western US. Environmentalists regularly argue for major protections for salmon from the logging industry. Logging can cause harm to salmon, but dams cause harm to these salmon populations many orders of magnitude beyond what forestry could ever do. The problem here is that the removal of dams is extremely unpopular politically, so they just focus on what is achievable so that they can demonstrate value to donors"

There is a lot of data showing that there is communication and information transfer between individuals of a species.

I understand the argument that our influence may be part of the natural order - but in reality we have a consciousness and thought system that allows us the ability to consider the consequences of our actions.    We have a tendency as a species to squander our natural resources which ensure both our survival, and the survival of other species.  If another creature dies out for reasons unrelated to human stupidity, I agree with the article.  But I tend to think across the board that we need to do things differently, and protecting the species we are harming is just the tip of the ice-burg to reversing everything we have damaged.  I tend to think of our planet as an organism, and if so many of it's species are dying off it is a sign of problem.  Maybe a species is not an organism in and of itself - but in many ways it can function like one.  The personal experience may belong to the individual, but is that really the point?"

But if we could gauge the effect of intervention, then under the individualist framework we would intervene if preserving the ecosystem would maximize utility for individual animals. So hypothetically let's say there are a dozen Giant Beast Xs that are invasive to a valley and disrupting the ecosystem. We know that if we allow them to thrive in the valley they will certainly strip it bare, destroying the ecosystem and thereby killing and displacing thousands of native animals. If that is true, then removing the Giant Beast Xs would be justified not to protect the ecosystem for the sake of protecting the ecosystem, but rather to protect the thousands of individuals who have reasonably predicted are going to suffer if we stand idly by. In other words, sometimes (maybe oftentimes or almost always) it will make sense to preserve the ecosystem in order to protect the individual sentient animals that depend on it. But sometimes, e.g. where the new species is functionally identical to another (as was the case with the hybrid ducks int he article), it is not justified to kill sentient beings to preserve the ecosystem when there is no overriding benefit to other sentient beings."

philosophy,3d4ijo,kochevnikov,2,Mon Jul 13 16:32:59 2015 UTC,"From an animal rights perspective, I'd argue that your question is backwards. We need to ask about how changes to an ecosystem might affect the rights holders (humans and animals) who live there. Ecosystems have no moral status and thus when we as humans say clear cut a forest, the damage isn't done to this abstract concept of ecosystem, but we need to look at how this might harm the animals who live there.  Prioritizing ecosystems means we must be willing to sacrifice individuals in the name of some abstract concept with no moral status on its own, which I think is pretty problematic as this sort of thinking is intimately linked with totalitarian thinking, whether it be abstract concepts of historical progress or racial purity or what have you.  We can also apply this thinking on issues like climate change. Why is this a problem? Because we're disrupting the natural whatever of mother earth? Of course not, the global climate has no ethical status. It's a problem because it could cause serious harm to people and animals.  So in many ways, this is where we see a huge conflict between a lot of environmentalist thinking and animal rights theory, even though they're often lumped together as if they're the same.  In short we should only care about ecosystems in an instrumental fashion as homes to rights-holders. An ecosystem with no rights-holders in it? Screw it, nuke it for all we care!"

The difference in individual sacrifice of animals and racial purity in my eyes are that humans>animals. With that being said things like climate change, extinction (or huge decreases of population) of species, and other human caused events can and probably will lead to the destruction of humans.  If you don't like my thinking I understand because it has little to no morals when it comes to the respect of animal life.

The line of reasoning you're proposing has the danger of being massively more totalitarian than any reasoning that simply assumes humans don't have the moral right to take control of every natural system, simply because we assert the right to adapt everything to some state we find preferable.

I certainly wouldn't, I don't care how many humans there are and how few aliens there are, numbers in a species doesn't give a right to destroy the rights of individuals.  Putting wild animals in a cage would violate the individual rights of the animal.  Making plants go extinct falls under my original comment. It's not immoral in itself, and is only a consideration in terms of how animals are interacting with those plants. If we find a new planet that is full of plant life but doesn't have a single species of animal on it, would it be unethical for us to say burn everything on that planet to the ground?  I say it wouldn't because plants don't have rights, nor does a planet as a concept.

Let's say we're building a road through a forest to connect two human cities, which will vastly improve things for us humans. Now we could just take an anthropocentric view and say if it's good for humans, whatever, build the road. That's a problem.

The author does a good job defending this claim by explaining the issues surrounding Oxyura leucocephala and the grey squirrels of the United Kingdom. While these defenses are strong, it does only pertain to species that are shown to have a neutral effect on their local ecosystems. It's not OK to kill individual grey squirrels to preserve the red ones because the red squirrels disappearing will not affect that ecosystem.   Let's move that argument to the southeastern coast of the United States where individual lionfish from the Indo-Pacific. Pterois volitans was introduced to that ecosystem much like the grey squirrel to the UK. The former however has been quantitatively shown to produce a slew of negative effects - including hurting coral, which produce positive impacts for its ecosystem.   But if we apply the ""individuals, not species argument"" here, we're not going to worry about the lionfish because it's ""morally wrong"" to do so, hurting the species (coral and others).  That also brings up the issue of determining importance to an ecosystem. Facially, we may see that the red squirrels aren't any better for a local ecosystem than the grey squirrels. It would be hard to assess that quantitatively though. Who knows? Once the red squirrels are removed, we may find they were more beneficial to the ecosystem than originally thought.   The author also brought up a lot of abstractions that may or may not be philosophically true. How are we defining sentient? How are we examining a species and an individual? I won't touch too much on that though.   In conclusion, I would say that this argument works limitedly. I understand it in circumstances where a species can be quantitatively proven to be a neutral party in the ecosystem verses an individual.

It appears just ""taken for granted"" or something.  On the other hand, there are pragmatic reasons for wanting to preserve certain species. The bumble-bee, for instance, plays a crucial role in polinating plants and is therefore an invaluable agricultural asset. The same could be said of other pest-controlling insects and animals.

There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time. The impact of biodiversity on any single ecosystem process is nonlinear and saturating, such that change accelerates as biodiversity loss increases. Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity, and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture. Loss of diversity across trophic levels has the potential to influence ecosystem functions even more strongly than diversity loss within trophic levels. Functional traits of organisms have large impacts on the magnitude of ecosystem functions, which give rise to a wide range of plausible impacts of extinction on ecosystem function."

philosophy,3d4ijo,splitnose,5,Mon Jul 13 16:53:18 2015 UTC,"First off, I'm working on my Ph.D. in fisheries-related stuff. So, I'm not just bullshitting here. Biological diversity is tremendously important for very real, and very practical, reasons. Here's a very brief and totally not-thorough summary of two particularly important reasons for conserving biodiversity:   Diversity within a species - i.e., genetic diversity - is what confers the ability for that species to adapt to changing conditions. When a species loses genetic diversity - by losing local populations, for example - it's basically losing options going forward. In marine biology, they call it the portfolio effect - when one species is made up of many localized populations, and it faces new environmental challenges, some of the local populations will do better and some will do worse - ultimately stabilizing the species, as a whole, against the environmental changes. Start losing populations, and you start losing that stabilizing ability.   Diversity between species is likewise important for buffering ecosystems against environmental change. Say you have two ecosystems - the first one has three primary producers, two herbivores, and one predator. The second has 15 of each. If one species is lost in the first one, the whole thing will go tits up, but if one species is lost in the second one, the other similar species will likely replace its ecological function.   That's a simplified example, but it gets the general idea across. The bottom line is that if you went to the academic literature for ""proof"" of the importance of biological diversity, you'd find it, in spades.   TL;DR: we need to conserve biological diversity not because of ""diversity is good"" beliefs, but because of its very important role in stabilizing species and ecosystems against change.   Edit: from the paper I linked, just because it is such a forceful statement regarding diversity (emphasis mine):  ""Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures."""

People who claim that Jews or Blacks or [other human group] are inhuman are not using any sort of scientific reasoning to get there, so racial discrimination is not an issue that needs to be addressed for actual scientists.  Still eugenics is a legitimate scientific concept: we really could breed exceptional people simply by requiring that those with good genes be allowed to breed more than those who do not.  We are now at a point where gene mapping and such can make this practical and scientific, rather than the pseudo-science nonsense of the nazis.    Still, the question there is: was bad science the only thing wrong with being a nazi?  Is it OK to round up and control the lives of human beings, if you happen to have scientific proof that you can make the next generation genetically superior?  Perhaps the answer to this can be derived from the fact that no-one even really talks about the bad science of the Nazis, but instead about the many lives they destroyed."

philosophy,3d4ijo,tchomptchomp,2,Tue Jul 14 01:39:32 2015 UTC,"This is sort of dumb because it is based on the wrong premises.  An analogy.  Let's say we have a city. Through that city cuts one big river. To cross that river, the city has built, over many years, lots of small bridges. Some of these bridges are poorly designed, or too small, or made of inferior building materials. They're costly to maintain. They were designed and built for another time.  Now, a civil engineer says ""hey, what if we just stop maintaining all those crappy bridges, and just build one big awesome bridge from the newest, best materials, and it'll be designed to carry all the necessary traffic across the river.""  This seems like a good enough idea, and soon enough there's just one massive bridge.    But now things are different. Neighborhoods that were once linked by foot traffic are now totally separated. More people rely on cars, because the only way across is a highway. Fewer people walk. Smaller business districts and mixed residential/commercial districts start closing up and being replaced by parking lots. Neighborhoods where people can't afford cars are now economically and physically isolated, and become centres of poverty, and then crime.  Whenever the main bridge has t close for repairs, the traffic is terrible and people may be stuck away from their workplaces, or their homes, for weeks at a time. Soon, many businesses relocate elsewhere where they don't have to worry about being cut off from their employees. The city sinks into urban decay.  My point here is that we need to have a really complete sense of how a system works before we can attempt to re-engineer it. In terms of ecosystem performance, we understand it very little, and the specific roles of specific organisms are even more poorly understood. Losing a keystone species (such as sea otters, wolves, bison, elephants, etc) can dramatically change ecosystem function, which can even have impacts as severe as overall landscape geography.   Because we don't really know how interchangeable these taxa are, we don't actually know whether plugging in one taxon instead of another will change ecosystem performance. We don't know if it'll cause the system to collapse, or to have adverse effects that we could not have predicted and that we are not willing to accept.   We also don't know how important population heterogeneity is to the long-term stability of these systems, both at the scale of our own lives and at geological time scales. We do know that extinctions matter, and that mass extinctions, when they've occurred, have changed the face of the world permanently. We know that population homogeneity can lead to susceptibility to communicable diseases in various lineages (e.g. CTVT in dogs, DFTD in Tasmanian devils) and can assist the spread of diseases like Bd that can wreck whole swaths of the ecosystem. And if something goes through that starts killing those species we've subbed in for everything else (e.g. colony collapse disorder, which is wrecking the honeybees that we replaced native pollinators with), then we're screwed.  And remember, once a species goes extinct, it's probably gone forever. Even if we can clone it, we've probably lost something for good.  There are other arguments too, such as that certain organisms are important for local culture, history, or environment, and that we've got a responsibility to preserve that, or that we have a responsibility to preserve wild spaces because it is good for us as humans to have places that are beyond our control. I could present all sorts of social justifications for environmentalism and preserving species.  But the big one is that it's dumb to start engineering an ecosystem that we barely understand by adding or subtracting organisms whose roles in that system we simply do not understand at all."

philosophy,3d4ijo,tchomptchomp,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:37:27 2015 UTC,"But would building that bridge be unethical? Would the engineer who proposed it be a bad person because of it? No.   I guess that depends on your system of ethics. If you're a deontologist, then there's no ethical breach. If you're a utilitarian, then the whole debacle is probably an ethics breach because it's caused a whole lot of suffering. In a practical sense, you've taken a working system and you've destroyed it, and that's definitely an ethical breach if practical applications of your actions are the goal. This is not a simple moral calculus to do and your prior assumptions about what ethics fundamentally are have major implications.   You're confusing ethics and politics. Of course our political decisions should take all sort of things into consideration, especially animals and how different people interact with each other, but politics can't be reduced to ethical reasoning. If it could, then we wouldn't need politics, as the answer to every public issue would be easy and obvious once we got people thinking about it.   I think that's fundamentally naive both about the multiplicity of types of ethical systems out there, the types of fundamental values that motivate people, and the level of knowledge that is present in any decision-making process vs the level of knowledge necessary to make the best decision.   Furthermore this isn't really about politics, just as this is not directly about science. It is absolutely about ethics. There are decisions that we make in the absence of knowledge. We do this all the time. Sometimes we make decisions that are self-contained enough that they're not going to dramatically disrupt the world we live in. However, fundamentally, there are choices we make, consciously, to change everything permanently. If we make a choice that has the potential to change everything permanently, and there is the potential for this change to cause mass suffering, then we have a responsibility to make sure our knowledge is as complete as possible before we take those steps.   Also remember that once an individual is killed, that individual is gone forever. I suffer real harm if you kill me, but if humans go extinct and no more are produced, no individuals are being harmed.   I'm not sure that (1) I necessarily agree with your moral logic here, nor am I sure that (2) this is directly relevant to collapses of systems diminishing the human experience and causing human suffering, but not resulting in human extinction.   To go back to the bridge, the rearrangement of the city infrastructure does not directly kill anyone, but it certainly produces a lot of suffering and destroys vitality and resources that were previously part of the world we live in. ""Community"" and ""interconnectedness"" were aspects of life in that society prior to the city reorganization, and now they are not, with no real replacement. Similarly, when we try to engineer the ecosystem at the expense of wild spaces and natural ecosystems, we lose things like ""nature"" and ""adventure"" and ""natural beauty"" and ""the sublime"" that can serve as catalysts for unique and deeply meaningful forms of human happiness, and what we replace them with may not fill those gaps in the human experience.   I also find it interesting that you've switched from deontology to utilitarianism when it suits your purposes. Which is interesting.   We may have other non-ethical reasons for preserving species, but ethically there's no ground to stand on with that regard, as I've pointed to in my other comments.   Once again, I strongly disagree with your fundamental assertion, which is that intention is the only source of ethical authority (apparently until you decide to switch to utilitarianism). This is ultimately a practical ethical issue. The underlying issue as far as I see it is that we do not have enough information to make a decision about the best principles.  There are consequences of our decisions beyond those of immediate intention. Those consequences themselves may have moral or immoral status and are large enough in scale that they are worth keeping in serious consideration. Whether or not you think that individual organisms are ends in and of themselves, when we're tampering with events at the level of the ecosystem, we have to think about all organisms that rely on that ecosystem, not just the ones we're tampering with. The indirect effects of ecosystem engineering (intentional or unintentional) are quite substantial and pleading ignorance is not really sufficient anymore."

While I would agree the animals mentioned are sentient, is it really fair to say the killing of any individual, regardless of it's species, is equally morally wrong? A similarity to human beings need not necessarily be thought of in a superficial/emotional way (in which people value them merely due to their similarities to humans). Human beings are capably of higher order thinking and feeling complex emotions that, as I'm sure most would agree, other animals are not (or at least, not to the same extent). A similarity to humans seems to indicate more sophisticated cognitive capabilities and awareness, and as such, it seems less morally permissible to damage an individual in a species of this sort."

Every time a species goes extinct, it eliminates the possibility of obtaining the joy that would come from experiencing that species.

I'm upset if an old building is knocked down which I find beautiful, but the act of knocking it down is not immoral as the building's status as beautiful in someone's eyes doesn't grant it any sort of moral status that can make its destruction harmful.

I do think that the author of the article ignored that there could be other reasons motivating preservation of species besides morality, and that those reasons are IMO the primary drivers behind the average person's dislike of extinctions.  Also that separation of morality from politics is a very interesting concept that I think (again) would depend on your moral system. If people value something (such as something beautiful), do you have a moral obligation to not destroy it? Does that, in a sense, grant it ethical status?

philosophy,3d6i9r,ReallyNicole,11,Mon Jul 13 22:20:17 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit confused.  Wouldn't a moral anti-realist just deny (4)?  Presumably, if someone is a moral anti-realist they have some positive reason why they don't think that moral facts exist.  Maybe they endorse something like Mackie's argument from queerness, or maybe they endorse some sort of Darwinian error theory.  It seems that, in these cases, the anti-realist wouldn't say that they have some reason to think that moral realism correct, apart from the mere fact that it's epistemically possible that they could be wrong about their reason for rejecting it.  But it doesn't seem right to say that something's merely being epistemically possible actually provides a positive (however small) reason to think that it's true.    To emphasize the issue even more, I'd bet that a decent chunk of anti-realists thinks that moral realism is metaphysically impossible, and I don't see how someone could rationally acknowledge that they have some reason to believe something that they take to be metaphysically impossible.  For example, I think the idea of a disembodied consciousness is metaphysically impossible (for Heideggerian reasons that I won't go into here).  I guess it's epistemically possible that I could be wrong in this belief, but it seems really strange to say that I have a reason to believe in disembodied consciousnesses, since I don't see how such a notion could even fit into my conceptual framework at all, and I don't even know what it would mean for me to hold such a belief.  Of course, the case of the moral anti-realist probably isn't as drastic, but I could see them reasoning along similar lines here."

Of course they'll think that the reasons for believing realism are ultimately overridden by those in favor of anti-realism, but it's not as though the outlook for realism is completely bleak.   To emphasize the issue even more, I'd bet that a decent chunk of anti-realists thinks that moral realism is metaphysically impossible   This seems like a very strong claim from the anti-realist and I just don't see support for it in any of the anti-realist arguments available right now.   for Heideggerian reasons that I won't go into here   You're goddamn right you won't."
philosophy,3d6i9r,simism66,2,Tue Jul 14 01:31:04 2015 UTC,"I would probably be fine if (4) was phrased like the bit in the parentheses as, ""There is some non-zero probability (understood in an epistemic sense) that torturing babies is objectively wrong.""  I think the argument would function fine if that change was made.  The only thing I was uncomfortable with was the jump from thinking that something is epistemically possible, to the thought that there is some positive reason to think that thing is true, but, on second thought, I don't think that jump is essential for the argument at all, even though your reply suggests that you do think it is in fact the case.    Now, thinking about it this way, I'm actually not sure if there's anything wrong with the argument.  It seems more in the vein of Pascal than Anselm though.  The epistemic possibility of a binding reason entails that (barring any deterring factors) one ought to consider oneself bound by that reason.  Of course, in the actual argument of Pascal, there are deterring factors, but, at least in the cases where there aren't any deterring factors, such a thought seems pretty right.    Here's a case where this thought is pretty intuitive with regard to an institutional reason: I'm going to a formal party with my friend.  I ask my friend if I need to wear a tie and she replies that she's not sure.  Assuming that there's no reason not to wear a tie (it's no hassle for me to put a tie on, and I know that wearing a tie won't be frowned upon at the party), the mere epistemic possibility that I might have to wear one gives me a reason to wear one, even though it might turn out that I didn't have to.  The baby case seems like it might fit the same mold even though the type of reason in question is a different one.  Assuming there's no reason to torture babies in the first place, the epistemic possibility that it might be a categorically awful thing to do, gives me a reason not to do so.  Here the reason is categorical rather than institutional, but insofar as one acknowledges the epistemic possibility of being bound by such a categorical reason, it seems that the same thought would apply.  As /u/narcissus_goldmund points out, most cases aren't so easy, but this at least seems to provide a neat little argument for the easy ones.  (As another side-note I actually wouldn't paraphrase Anselm's argument as ""the possibility of God entails the existence of God.""  Plantinga's ontological argument might be phrased like that, Anselm's doesn't really include such a modal notion if I recall correctly.)  I still responded to your reply, but, now I don't think it's actually very relevant to the argument (which I now suppose I agree with to some extent), so feel no need to respond to what's below the line unless you think it actually is relevant.     Surely even the most staunch anti-realist thinks that realists make some good points   That's probably true.  However, I can just as well imagine an anti-realist framing this issue in one of the following ways:   ""Lots of philosophers think X constitutes a reason for moral realism.  I understand why they would think this.  However, they don't realize that there's an equally attractive anti-realist alternative that allows us to explain X without the metaphysical baggage.""  ""Some philosophers find arguments X, Y, and Z as compelling reasons for moral realism.  Of course, these philosophers are just as smart as me, and have read the same literature that I have.  I'm not saying that I'm certain they're wrong, but I just don't see how these things which they cite as reasons are good reasons at all.""  More straightfowardly, I'm not sure if I'm on board with this way of thinking about philosophical claims where I have varying weights of reasons for practically every position and then, wherever the scale tips is the position I end up holding.  Perhaps that's a good model for some scientific claims where we're dealing with varying strengths of empirical evidence, but I'm not sure if philosophical reasoning works like that.  Take a philosophical argument like the consequence argument, for example.  I think the consequence argument is tempting line of thought.  However, if I actually thought the consequence argument constituted a reason for incompatibilism, I tend to think I'd be committed to incomaptiblism, since the argument aims to sufficiently establish that conclusion.    I still think that any philosopher would acknowledge the epistemic possibility of the contrary position, but they don't think they have a reason to hold it.  I guess I'd say that having a reason to think a view is possibly true (where ""possible"" is being used in an epistemic sense) on the basis of peer disagreement or something like that, isn't the same thing as having a reason to think a view is actually true.  Perhaps that's overly picky.   This seems like a very strong claim from the anti-realist.   It needn't be.  Mathematicians, for example, might disagree about whether a particular mathematical statement is true.  They might also both think that mathematical truths are metaphysically necessary, and so both hold that the other one believes in something that is metaphysically impossible without any hubris--that's just the nature of the domain in question.  Some philosophical issues might just be like that."

Suppose I like to plant landmines around my neighborhood. You tell me that I shouldn't do it because someone might walk on them and get blown up. I say, 'That's okay; I don't believe anyone ever will.' That's a bad response.    I might also have said: 'That's okay; I don't believe that moral realism is true.' That's a bad response. It might be true, and if it is true, then I'm doing something really seriously wrong by planting landmines around my neighborhood. It's not enough for the anti-realist to say that they don't believe that realism is true. Unless they're certain that realism is false, the possibility that it's true gives them a good reason not to plant landmines around their neighborhood.    Or: 'But I don't believe in God' is a bad response to Pascal's Wager.    In any case, if I had to criticize it, here's PRP again, plus the conclusion of ATA, interpolating in 'moral' to grant (9):     (PRP) If the following conditions hold: (a) If S knew that P, this would provide a reason for S to Φ, (b) if S knew that ~P, this would provide no reason for S not to Φ, (c) S has some reason to believe that P Then S thereby has a reason to Φ. (Huemer 265) [...] (5) Therefore, we have a [moral] reason to avoid torturing babies.     I wonder whether anti-realists have to deny that we have any objective reason at all, of any weight, to act in some moral way. Wouldn't they still count as anti-realists if they held, e.g., that everyone always has a tiny moral reason to act a certain way, but there are always outweighing or defeating other-reasons not to? After all, I have some instrumental reason to buy a lottery ticket, but it's ultima facie instrumentally irrational for me to do so.    If someone came along and said that they believe that moral reasons exist, but that it's always permissible to go with one's instrumental preferences instead of obeying those moral reasons, then I'm not sure what they'd be. Indeed, suppose our person said that no one ever has an all-things-considered reason to act morally. Would they be a moral realist or not?      Maybe someone could try to describe a kind of 'conditional' reason and analyze it in a way that's not supposed to be open to traditional arguments against moral realism. Off the top of my head, though, I guess those reasons would still be (e.g.) intrinsically motivating, and maybe suspect in all the normal ways in which moral reasons are supposed to be suspect."
philosophy,3d6i9r,kabrutos,2,Tue Jul 14 01:21:43 2015 UTC,"It seems to me as though anti-realist responses to Cuneo are also available here. That is, subjectivists can say of premise 4 ""well all epistemic justification is subjective, so premise 4 is subjectively true making 6 false."" And the error theorist (like Olson) can say ""none of our beliefs are justified, so we have no reason to think that moral realism might be true.""  I don't mean to suggest that these responses are successful, but I wonder if you think that, if true, they would undermine Huemer's argument."

This makes me wonder whether going through the argument and inserting 'categorical' before 'reason' at various points, versus inserting 'hypothetical' before 'reason,' would be illuminating. For Olson et al. to avoid just ending up with no reasons existing of any kind, even prudential ones, I think they'd have to be able to accept a PRP for instrumental or hypothetical reasons, but not for categorical ones. But that's at least consonant with their overall project.      As for the subjectivist, yes, but if we're already looking at moral judgments and they seem subjectively true to us, then we're not going to be persuaded much by realism anyway. So I see that as leading us to an overall Moorean evaluation: Does (6) seem true or false?    In any case, just to be clear, is our anti-realist saying that it's subjectively true that we have some reason to believe in the objective moral truth? I.e., they're a subjectivist about epistemic reasons as well? They'd have to for this to really be a response to the argument. But that's going to be kind of strange, since at least (right?), they'd have to grant that when moral realists assert the conclusion of the argument, they're saying something true: they're reporting their attitude according to which moral realism is justified. I guess they might be willing to do that."

I have never been able to wrap my head around claims like this. I should probably have read more about it before dismissing it, but I've never been able to see how subjectivism could even make sense, I guess not even semantically. ""Subjectively true"" seems like it contains a contradiction in that truth implies mind independence. I covered it in classes, one being a 300 level epistemology one, but I don't recall it ever clicking even in a way I could feel comfortable writing about it except if the subjectivist considers truth just a convention, or maybe something a reliabilist would accept.

Suppose there's a scary house down the block. I have reason to be afraid of ghosts, but only really if they exist. I'm an anti-realist about ghosts, but I acknowledge that if they existed, I'd have reason to be afraid of them. I don't think I've committed myself to the existence of any kind of queer entity yet. Someone tells me I have reason to avoid going into that house because there might be ghosts there. I say, 'Sure, there might be, but there probably aren't, so my ghost-avoidance-reason is disabled.'

philosophy,3d6i9r,faintbluetree,2,Tue Jul 14 06:20:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your replies.    Yeah, I don't know whether anyone who's persuaded by anti-realist arguments would be okay with granting what I'm suggesting. You would get some of the benefits (?) of anti-realism--that you can basically ignore moral reasons--but lose some of the others, as /u/TheGrammarBolshevik also suggests in their reply to me here.    Maybe the following is a way of developing the reply a bit more. Our anti-realist imports Dancy's language of 'enabled' and 'disabled' reasons. They say that as an anti-realist, they don't believe in any non-disabled moral reasons. And moral reasons are disabled when (inter alia) we're epistemically justified in rejecting the existence of moral truths.    In general, I think, this would be easiest to sustain if someone were to hold the view of reasons according to which there's just an overall-right thing to do; sometimes moral reasons win and sometimes prudential reasons win. If I remember correctly from Ethical Intuitionism, Mike does hold that view. And so there isn't always in the background the morally right thing to do, sitting there among the prudentially right thing to do and (say) the aesthetically right thing to do. Instead, you take into account all the types of reasons that might be justifying various behaviors, and go through and set to 'zero' all the disabled ones.     I don't know whether disabled moral reasons are queer. But they're not intrinsically motivating; they're not motivating at all. Maybe they're a bit like the fact that ghosts, if they existed, would be queer, and moral anti-realists can cheerfully admit that."
philosophy,3d6i9r,t3nk3n,2,Tue Jul 14 13:09:40 2015 UTC,"Sorry, one more thing:    Maybe our anti-realist can say that the reason Mike has discovered, and that PRP reports, is ""internalistic"" rather than ""externalistic"" in the reasons-for-action sense.    That is, the truth of PRP generates all sorts of reasons to respond to the potential existence of various kinds of facts. But it only really gives us externalistic reasons when (in this case) P is actually true.    And surely anti-realists could be okay with saying that there are only internalistic moral reasons, something like moral reasons that are generated by your own preferences or potentially-mistaken beliefs. Going back to the betting-example, if you don't care about money, then you have no reason to bet on a particular team. Or going back to ghosts, if I mistakenly believe that ghosts exist, then surely I have a reason to avoid spending the night in the scary house down the block. Hardcore naturalists can say this without compromise.    So what Mike would need, maybe, is a version of PRP that explicitly reveals externalistic reasons as well. This will be tricky to do in a non-question-begging way, because moral reasons are the paradigm externalistic reasons in this sense: the ones that restrict your behavior even if you don't believe in them nor care about them."
philosophy,3d6i9r,faintbluetree,12,Tue Jul 14 13:31:34 2015 UTC,"/u/ReallyNicole is correct here, there is a trick. However, it is a very subtle trick and involves some sleight of hand. What Huemer is does is present a premise that moral anti-realists are going to immediately jump on, but is so weak as to be almost true by definition (premise 4). Then, you spend all of your time debating this premise (see, for example, this thread) and you ignore the premise that is actually false, which is in the PRP itself.   Huemer is arguing that if you know x, you have a reason to bet on x, but this is false. Knowing x is a reason to bet on x, given that you have a reason to place winning bets that is true with respect to all of the things that the realist cares about. However, moving to the realm of moral reasoning, this becomes something like, if you knew something was morally wrong, you would have a reason to not do it given that you have a reason to not do morally wrong things that is true with respect to all of the things that the realist cares about. It is this premise that moral anti-realists are going to dispute, that there are real moral reasons to not do things.  P.S. I don't want to insinuate that Huemer is being dishonest, or engaged in trickery, or anything like that. The normative words are just easier than the non-normative ones."
philosophy,3d6i9r,TheGrammarBolshevik,4,Tue Jul 14 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"Isn't the argument captured better as: Knowing X is a reason to act as if X is true? The language of placing bets is just a convenient description of probabilistic beliefs guiding action in proportion to the strength of belief.  Of course, I'd agree that such a framework necessitates we act on beliefs subject to all our beliefs, weighted in terms of likelihoods and expected outcomes. So for the anti-realist Huemer's argument basically amounts to a prudential consideration of the possibility of moral realism. That is, clearly, despite (3), I may have other strong reasons to Φ and a very small chance of P will not be of much interest.  The argument basically goes as: Assume you have some reason to to think P(P) > 0 (nzP). It follows that you have some reason to suppose P because a reason to believe nzP is a reason to believe P. Sure. Not moral realism in any sense I care about, but I agree.  As an aside, I'm not sure (3) gets any work done in this argument. I think (5) follows from (2) and (4), alone."

If there is a mind-independent reason to not do morally wrong things, Huemer's argument works.   So for the anti-realist Huemer's argument basically amounts to a prudential consideration of the possibility of moral realism.   This strikes me as very much false. That's the point of Huemer granting that arguendo the possibility of moral realism being true is infinitesimally small.  If X is a reason to not do something but ~X is not a reason to do it, it doesn't matter how likely X is. To make this argument about prudential considerations, you need to argue how it being not morally wrong to torture babies is itself a reason to torture babies. You can't appeal to other reasons. Do that and then you can appeal to comparative odds."

This may reflect a basic misunderstanding on my part but I take the argument to skirt the existence of antecedent facts that provide us with reasons. Rather, I take the PRP to say we have reasons to act in accordance with such facts if we have reasons to believe such facts obtain.  As far as I can tell, reasons to act in accordance with moral facts, stemming from reasons to believe such facts obtain, meet (A) and (B). These reasons are not the initial fact, they are independent of its existence.  Of course, I might have reasons to suspect such a moral fact exists along with contrary reasons. Hence the probabilistic framing.   If X is a reason to not do something but ~X is not a reason to do it, it doesn't matter how likely X is.   We're saying X is a reason not to do some Φ. Perhaps I have prudential reasons for doing Φ. Now we say I have a reason to believe the probability of X being true P(X) > 0 (call it nzP for non-zero Probability). The reason to believe nzP meets (A) and (B) and is itself a reason not to Φ. But it could well be a very weak reason not to Φ. And I want to Φ for prudential reasons.  If I judge X to be sufficiently unlikely, say P(X) ≈ P(I am a Boltzmann brain), then it seems to me prudential reasons easily overcome nzP.   [Y]ou need to argue how it being not morally wrong to torture babies is itself a reason to torture babies.   Hm. I don't follow this requirement for some reason. Why does this hold?"

So, it seems clear that in order to make the PRP work in terms of morality, you would have to lay out what background conditions must obtain in order for 2-4 to be true. Otherwise, the argument is not true for the exact same reason saying you have a reason to bet on team A because they have a better chance of winning is not true.   The anti-realist dispute with Huemer will take place over the nature of these background conditions.

Let's take aborting developmentally disabled babies for example. There are reasons to believe that such an abortion might be objectively wrong and also reasons to believe that such an abortion might be objectively right. If we push through the parallel arguments, then we get that we have objective reasons to both perform and not perform such abortions. If we take Huemer's argument at face value, then, we are immediately left with a system with genuine moral dilemmas, which is already pretty controversial in itself. In fact, most, if not all, moral issues become genuine moral dilemmas (even baby-torturing, because god knows somebody has thought of a reason that baby-torturing might be objectively good). That leaves us with a 'realism' which is all but trivial and provides no guide to how we should act, and, contrary to what you say in the first section, in fact seems incapable of supporting most of the moral frameworks that we usually mean when talking about moral realism.

philosophy,3d6i9r,jorio,6,Tue Jul 14 00:13:47 2015 UTC,"Regarding genuine moral dilemmas: Huemer makes a distinction early in the paper which I've left out here because redditors don't like words. He acknowledge a difference between so-called third-person and first-person reasons. The former are reasons one has independent of one's knowledge and the latter are reasons one has given what one knows. So in the sense of third-person reasons we don't necessarily seem committed to there being any moral dilemmas, but I take it that this is the sort of dilemma that you would find objectionable.  Although I'm not sure why you think that all moral issues would become dilemmas. Keep in mind that the PRP only gives us some reason to Φ. Huemer does not think that these reasons are overriding, though. So if I dream up some reason, however outlandish, to think that torturing babies is right, then I'm only committed to thinking that there's some very small reason for me to torture babies. But this reason may ultimately pale in comparison to various reasons that I have not to torture babies."
philosophy,3d6i9r,voice_of_unreason,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:25:50 2015 UTC,"So, if one were an externalist about moral motivations, then (2) would straightforwardly be false, and one could defeat the argument that way.  Let me give you my thoughts on the PRP, though, and see if they lead anywhere. It seems to me that Huemer equivocates between different kinds of reasons. To see why that might be, let me write out the arguments with the kinds of reasons that I think are being referred to in each case.  First, for practical reasons, like sports betting, or meteors:  (a) If S knew that P, this would provide a practical reason for S to Φ, (b) if S knew that ~P, this would provide no practical reason for S not to Φ, (c) S has some epistemic reason to believe that P  Then, S has practical reason to Φ. This version goes through fine, but when we consider moral reasons, like baby torturing:  (a) If S knew that P, this would provide a moral reason for S to Φ, (b) if S knew that ~P, this would provide no moral reason for S not to Φ, (c) S has some epistemic reason to believe that P  Then, does S have moral reason to Φ? I think that it is much less clear that this version of the PRP obtains. There appear to be key differences between practical and moral reasons that block, or at least diminish, the plausibility of the PRP for moral reasons. What might these be? I'm not entirely sure quite yet, but here is at least one possibility.  Intuitively, I think that practical reasons can be ultimately cashed out to some quantifiable value. That is, one has a practical reason to Φ just in the case that its expected value to me is positive. If we accept this, then it is easy to see through simple probability why the PRP holds for practical reasons.  Moral reasons, on the other hand, can't be cashed out similarly in the general case. An action does not have an expected moral value ranging over all of the possibly true moral theories. Thus, the PRP fails, or at least would seem to require more justification, in the case of moral reasons."

Recall that the sort of reason Huemer has in mind here is with the ""objective"" qualifier is a categorical one. Externalism, then, is one of the targets of the argument. And just to be clear, by ""externalism"" you mean something like ""S has a reason to Φ iff S desires that Φ,"" right? Because if you mean simply ""S having a reason to Φ doesn't always entail that S is motivated to Φ,"" then that doesn't really say much about Huemer's (2).   Then, does S have moral reason to Φ? I think that it is much less clear that this version of the PRP obtains.   Huemer gives an example of the PRP applied to moral reasons. Tell me if this eases your worries. Suppose that you're testing out your new machine gun by shooting it blindly into the forest. We can produce something like the following:  (a) If you knew that somebody was in your line of fire, that would provide a moral reason not to shoot.  (b) If you knew that nobody was in your line of fire, that would provide no moral reason not to shoot.  (c) You have some epistemic reason to think that somebody is in your line fire.

philosophy,3d6i9r,jorio,3,Thu Jul 16 05:36:41 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the consistent antirealist should say that something isn't quite right about PRP. One route for this is to say that it doesn't hold independently of our attitudes (and so she'll deny premise 6). That is, this relation only holds between our reasons for believing and our reasons for action given certain facts about our evaluative attitudes. So the reasons for action we have given the reasons we have to believe that moral realism is true are not attitude-independent.  Alternatively, she might refine PRP in the following way. The reason we would have to Φ given the truth of P would have to stand in some relation other than counterfactual dependence. Instead, PRP might need a condition more like ""If S knew that P, S would have an attitude-dependent reason to Φ"" or something. So that sounds like question begging, but I think the antirealist could argue that the mere ""counterfactually would have a reason to Φ given that knowledge"" formulation is too broad.   So, for one thing, the antirealist might say that the most nearby possible world in which we know that P (for certain P) is so distant (or something) that our having a reason to Φ there wouldn't transfer to our having a reason to Φ based on mere reasons to believe here. Some facts might be such that my knowing them would make me so different that my evaluative set under conditions of knowing P wouldn't be appropriately similar to my actual evaluative set.   Along the same lines, although I don't think this strategy is too great, the antirealist might say that PRP doesn't hold for counterpossibles: I can't have a reason based on the possibility of knowing something if it's impossible for me to know that thing.  Finally, and I think better, the antirealist might appeal to absurd counterfactuals that show what's wrong with the moral case. It could easily be the case that I have some reason to believe absurd things about my reasons (say, that I have reason to do things that will frustrate all my desires, or that everyone has attitude-independent reason to devote their lives to watching grass grow, or whatever). The antirealist might try to motivate the claim that these examples are absurd enough that we should deny PRP.  Okay, so those are a couple of routes of response. Also, I'm curious about the following thing: I don't know why the reason cited in premises 2-4 needs to be objective. You might think you need that reason to be objective for premise 6 to go through. But that isn't quite right. So take a parallel case, where I substitute 2 (and everything else) with: If I knew that torturing babies would make me feel bad, this would give me a reason not to torture babies. This is true, it seems to me, regardless of attitudes, in the way that ""I don't desire to kill babies"" is true regardless of attitudes (that is, its truth supervenes on facts about attitudes, but not in any inappropriate way). Maybe you deny this.  Anyway, that sort of example makes me wonder: do you think the reason that's going to come out when you apply PRP to moral beliefs will have different ontological standing from the reason that comes out when you apply PRP to descriptive beliefs (which give me prudential reasons)? I feel like we have good reason to think that these reasons won't be of different ontological standing, and that the more plausible kind of ontological standing for them to have is the kind that's palatable to the antirealist. If you disagree, how do you think the ""objectivity"" of the moral reason infects, as it were, the PRP-derived reason?"
philosophy,3d6i9r,voice_of_unreason,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:28:49 2015 UTC,"One route for this is to say that it doesn't hold independently of our attitudes (and so she'll deny premise 6).    Huemer devotes a section to this in the paper, but it's longer than I want to type out at the moment so I'll just point you to the end of page 271.   So that sounds like question begging, but I think the antirealist could argue that the mere ""counterfactually would have a reason to Φ given that knowledge"" formulation is too broad.   I'm not sure how it can be too broad. The broad formulation of the PRP is meant to be theory neutral, so it's friendly to realists and anti-realists alike.   Finally, and I think better, the antirealist might appeal to absurd counterfactuals that show what's wrong with the moral case.   Maybe, but I think that the best thing for the realist to do here is just lean on our confidence in the problematic cases compared to the intuitive ones (e.g. the betting example). So our reasons for believing that, as you say, it's objectively right to watch grass grow are either non-existent or so insignificant as to barely count.   If I knew that torturing babies would make me feel bad, this would give me a reason not to torture babies.   The analog for (4) would be true in virtue of some attitudes. Namely, that we have some reason to believe that we have the attitude ""I don't like torturing babies,"" or whatever."

Well, I think if you go this route, you'll have to introduce some level for how much reason we need to have to believe something in order for PRP-type reasons to kick in. Then the antirealist will argue either 1) moral realism doesn't reach this level of justification or 2) that the fact that PRP requires certain levels of justification shows that it gives attitude-dependent reasons. On the latter: they'll argue that the best explanation for why certain kinds of reasons for belief don't make the cut is just that these reasons are based on our attitudes, and we don't take entirely minor reasons for belief to give us reason to act in accordance with the content of those beliefs. I think the latter strategy is good, although maybe I haven't explained it clearly.   The analog for (4) would be true in virtue of some attitudes. Namely, that we have some reason to believe that we have the attitude ""I don't like torturing babies,"" or whatever.   I don't think this quite right. The baby-torturing version of premise 4 is also true in version of some attitudes, namely the attitudes that underpin my reasons for belief (I stand in such-and-such a relation to evidence).   Still, whatever. I'm sure you could give a version that gets past that problem. But I don't see why it is that running the possibility of objective reasons through PRP must generate objective reasons. We can shove in whatever kind of strange reasons we like into PRP: moral reasons that aren't intrinsically motivating, say, or reasons that don't supervene on reality, etc. It's certainly logically possible that someone could be justified in believing in such reasons. So do reasons of those types exist once you run them through PRP?  It seems like the best answer is no. PRP can't just generate counterintuitive varieties of reasons. The reasons generated by PRP are of a constrained sort. That is, their nature is already given by whatever it is that makes PRP true, not by the kind of reason we run through PRP.   This all amounts to a motivation for the claim that PRP isn't true regardless of attitudes etc.: the antirealist would say that the best way to understand the reasons PRP generates is as attitude-dependent. The realist should either 1) argue that PRP can generate objective reasons but not other wacky sorts of reasons or 2) just be okay with highly counterintuitive types of reasons existing. I think 2) is a bad strategy, and 1) is fine but I'm not sure how it would work. I don't see any principled reason to think that the nature of an objective reason will be preserved when run through PRP, but the nature of absurd types of reasons won't be."

I think a lot more needs to be said about this response in order to make it compelling. At the very least I feel like Huemer is just going to say that intuition provides justification in a way that isn't problematic for realism, as per his broader project in epistemology.   But I don't see why it is that running the possibility of objective reasons through PRP must generate objective reasons.   So you don't think premise 8 is true?

Therefore I have a reason to watch grass grow.

I think a lot more needs to be said about this response in order to make it compelling. At the very least I feel like Huemer is just going to say that intuition provides justification in a way that isn't problematic for realism, as per his broader project in epistemology.   Yeah, I would need to say a lot more. But basically, I think the ""levels of justification"" approach introduces a feature of PRP (viz. that some reasons only exist if our reasons to believe are past a certain threshold) that's best explained by PRP generating attitude-dependent reasons, not attitude-independent ones. Of course, that might just be my antirealist intuitions manifesting themselves or whatever.    So you don't think premise 8 is true? What about the defense of it that Huemer gives?   I think premise 8 is fine. I want to deny that PRP is true regardless of attitudes etc. Or rather, I think that however you cash out your ""independent of attitudes etc in the way necessary for moral realism,"" either premise 6 or premise 8 will be false, and I think the most plausible way of cashing this out will make premise 6 false.   The concern here that Huemer's argument might entail all sorts of silly reasons strikes me as coming only after we accept that the argument proves realism. And once realism is proven we can deploy a theory of moral epistemology that avoids this overabundance of silly duties.   I think I didn't clearly express the kinds of silly reasons I wanted to introduce. I didn't mean to say that PRP will generate reasons with wacky content, although of course it'll do that too. Rather, I meant to say that it will generate reasons of a wacky nature if say that the input-reasons are of the same nature as the output-reasons. Note that this is all in service of an argument that all output-reasons ought to be attitude-dependent.  Right, so I think there are some kinds of reasons the moral realist won't want to countenance: she'll want to say, of some reasons, that no reasons of that nature exist. If she's an internalist, she'll say that there are no non-intrinsically-motivating moral reasons. She'll presumably have other commitments about our prudential and epistemic reasons. Perhaps she'll think that we have no epistemic reasons to believe P on the grounds that P is utterly unlikely, or that we have no prudential reasons to phi if phi-ing will frustrate all our ends. But I think that PRP, if it preserves ""objectivity,"" will also preserve these weird features of reasons. So it'll generate reasons of a nature that the realist won't want to countenance.  So the realist either needs to be okay countenancing just any weird kind of reason or needs to give an argument that PRP generates objective reasons, but not these other weird kind of reason. Again, I think the best way to argue that PRP doesn't generate these weird kind of reasons is to argue that it only generates attitude-dependent reasons of such-and-such a kind. But this would amount to denying premise 6, since PRP would no longer be attitude-independently true."
philosophy,3d6i9r,jorio,3,Tue Jul 14 16:55:04 2015 UTC,"Tribal societies often have rites of passage that could easily be regarded as torture. The individuals who go through these are typically adolescent males( sometimes boys) with the goal of entering adulthood or joining a particular social class( usually warriors).  The purpose is almost always to toughen up the boy, cull weaklings, and also usually has a religious significance attached. It's a fact that some children will die from this.  Does that make the practice wrong? Well it depends on preconceived value system. The tribesmen are not simply ignorant of the possibility of child death or what causes it and clearly don't believe they are doing something wrong. Huemer's line of reasoning would only hold if the people using it all share the same general value system and can be relied on to interpret facts in basically the same way. That would suggest that preconceived notions matter. Huemer would have to prove those notions to be objective to prove moral realism, and a moral anti-realist could easily dismiss the above reasoning without that.  Little rewrite:  “[...] if some fact would (if everyone knew it) provide a reason for everyone to behave in a certain way, then everyone having some reason to believe that this fact obtains also provides everyone with a reason to behave in the same way.”   This seems more obviously problematic."

Even then, it is clear they had false beliefs about what was required for survival, and perhaps more arguably, what was the most efficient/desirable way of structuring society in relation to the ends that societies tend to promote insofar as they are societies.   Sparta is perhaps the perfect example, for their harsh practices were aberrant when compared to other Greek city states and most societies clearly did not need such practices to survive. Moreover, the full mobilization of a society towards war was also likely the reason they were ultimately defeated by Thebes (meaning they had false beliefs even about how to fight and win wars in the long term). Practices such as this prevented there being high-class, high-power non-warriors required to perform tasks that warriors were not specialized in and were unable to under take when at war (even in the Peloponnesian War they only won at a great loss for this reason). Moreover, they would drive our foreigners every year, another factor that would limit its growth when compared to a city state like Athens (and even its efficiency at fighting wars). Plato provides an interesting critique of the Spartan obsession with war, as if this was the proper or best direction for a society, and it is no wonder that Sparta was conquered and its practices died out."

(again largely because they didn't understand many things about how the world works)   Run through Huemers sieve each of these perspectives would yield different outcomes, disproving it as a proof of moral realism.   Huermer's argument does not depend on the perspectives of particular groups or whether such prospectives would yield different outcomes. If you run through the scientific perspectives of different tribes you will get different outcomes, say that the gods cause the sun to rise or misfortune is the result of witchcraft in the world, but that doesn't in any way show that scientific realism is false. You never even addressed the fact that the Spartans had aberrant practices and false beliefs (even compared to their contemporaries).  Edit:  We could also say that the Spartans didn't consider this to be 'torture' but more so a 'test,' so even they wouldn't think torturing babies as such is morally good (surely they practiced real torture in war and would make a distinction between what they do in those cases to enemies and what they do to their own potential Spartans).

(B) defines that reasons for moral actions be categorical, that it is independent from subjective experience. The argument presumes a particular subjective knowledge. It includes a non-rigorous explanation of what categorical can mean, but categorical is widely held to mean it applies independent of subjective concerns. The reasons for believing in the Anti-Torture Argument depend on limited subjective knowledge.   Yes? What's your point?   Even if we were to presume that the knowledge in support of the ATA is categorical, we have no reason to prefer that knowledge over knowledge implying an opposing action. Because of this, the argument applied with anti-ATA knowledge creates a non-zero probability that there is a real morality with precisely opposite demands with no reason to choose one interpretation over another aside from subjective preferences. The argument is self-negating without including subjectivity thus violating the requirement that moral reasoning be categorical."

In other words, categorical reasons are not hypothetical reasons.   The reasons for believing in the Anti-Torture Argument depend on limited subjective knowledge.   I'm not sure what you're getting at here. Knowledge is factive, so it's hard to see what's subjective about it.   Even if we were to presume that the knowledge in support of the ATA is categorical, we have no reason to prefer that knowledge over knowledge implying an opposing action.    Even if this were the case it would still only support moral realism. And as I've said what seems like countless times in this thread the argument seeks only to establish moral realism.

This may be true, but that is not relevant to those that disagree.   the premises of the Anti-Torture Argument are all objectively true   Except that the people this is arguing against do not believe that, so the whole argument is begging the question isn't it?

philosophy,3d6i9r,Philsofer1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:06:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what it could be like to have a reason for action independent of interests, desires, aims, and so on.  Suppose it is the case that a certain window is fragile. Suppose that if I were to throw a chair at it, the window would break.  If I am locked in a room with that window and a chair, and if I need desperately to get out, then knowing that the window is fragile gives me a reason to throw a chair at the window.  If I own the window and want it to remain intact, then knowing that the window is fragile gives me a reason to avoid throwing a chair at it.  The mere fact that the window is fragile gives me no reasons one way or the other. It doesn't even give me a reason to believe that the window is fragile, since I might want to believe (for perverse reasons, I grant) all and only falsehoods.  Suppose now that torturing babies is objectively wrong. If I want to do only not-morally-wrong things, then knowing so, I have a reason not to torture a baby. But if I want to do only morally wrong things, then knowing so, I have a reason to torture a baby.  It seems that what I have reasons for doing depends crucially on my interests, desires, aims, and so on.  Hence, I want to say that premisses (2) and (3) are under-specified in that they do not give the background set of interests that make them seem plausible to most readers. We could be more careful and add background interests. I want to do morally right things and avoid doing morally wrong things. I have serious aversions to torturing anything, let along a baby. But then, the argument is supposed to work independently of my interests. If the argument is only plausible to me in virtue of my background interests, desires, etc., then we don't get (6) in the more general argument. So, specifying more of the background to make (2) and (3) plausible can't be the move that Huemer wants.  But then ... what is the move here?  Huemer can't just assert (6) now, since that's what's being disputed specifically in relation to (2) and (3). He has to give reasons for thinking that (2) and (3) are true independent of interests and so forth. What are those reasons? The OP asserts that (2) is true by definition. But I don't see how. Or maybe I am disputing the definition. (I'm not sure what definition is being appealed to or how the appeal is supposed to work, so I'm not sure which thing is going wrong by my lights.) Either way, it seems that we need more here. And the OP's defense of (3) rests on the defense of (2), since it assumes that to know that something is not morally wrong is simply to lack one sort of reasons to avoid doing something, not to have positive reasons to do it, and that that is all there is to say on the matter.  Perhaps the above train of reasoning will be clearer if we stick strictly to the way the PRP is stated throughout the first argument.  (1) The PRP.  (2) If S knew that torturing babies was objectively wrong, this would provide a reason for S to avoid torturing babies.  (3) If S knew that torturing babies was not objectively wrong, this would not provide a reason for S to not-avoid torturing babies.  (4) S has some reason to believe that torturing babies is objectively wrong.  Therefore, (5) S has some reason to avoid torturing babies.  Re-stated in terms of an arbitrary person S, I think we can plausibly dispute (2) and (3) as under-specified. Whether they are true or false depends on lots of facts about S that are not given in the argument.  I think that the under-specification problem is clearest for (3), so I'll wrap up with a challenge to (6) directed through (3). Suppose S is a very adventurous person but not one to do anything morally wrong. So, S says to herself, ""I would like to do everything that is not morally prohibited."" Given S's desires to do things that are not morally prohibited, if S knew that torturing babies was not objectively wrong, S would have a reason to not-avoid torturing babies. Hence, (3) does depend on the background interests of S -- something that we were not well-situated to notice because of our own background interests -- and so (6) is false."

If we knew that torturing babies was not objectively right, we would not have a reason to not torture babies. Let's say we have some reason to believe that torturing babies is objectively right. Of course that seems very strange, but all we have to do is believe some marginally probable reason--maybe baby torture turns out to have an obscure health benefit. Therefore we have a reason to torture babies.   Does ~Φ break the argument in some way I'm not seeing? Maybe what the anti-realist really argues isn't that moral facts don't exist, but rather that we have no compelling way to discriminate between them. This seems to threaten moral realism because it implies that the existence of moral facts is inconsequential. It seems to me that the moral realist would have to provide an argument that some moral facts are better than others.

This egoism is, however, as Smith argues, non-predatory and can accommodate helping others, genuine friendship, and even in certain circumstances risking one's life for another. Ultimately Rand appears as a somewhat paradoxical figure. A veneer of Nietzschean immoralism conceals the fact that, according to Smith, serving one's own interest in Randian fashion entails treating others in ways that are not as out of line with standard moral thinking as we may first assume.   As much as I dislike the use of the phrase ""standard moral thinking"" (because what does that mean anyway?), this one bit does an excellent job of hinting at the value that can be found in the Objectivist ethical system--if the reader is able to get past pre-conceived notions that are already strongly entrenched."

Apart from avoiding obvious physical sources of pain, we're morally lost.  Ayn Rand's ethics provides a strong set of principles (values and virtues) for attaining a flourishing life, and thus, happiness. Happiness is a state in which the highest and purest pleasures (unpolluted by pain, fear, or guilt) are open to an individual, and in which (under normal circumstances) they are regularly achieved."

Paraphrasing , of course, and I do not discount your argument, in many instances you, in my opinion, may be right.  However, I've come to believe, through twenty years of experience teaching in American public high schools that a great deal of what we used to call critical thinking has been slowly stripped away from the curriculum.    Civics got thoroughly pulled out of the Social Sciences, other branches of curricular focus like Literature lost the time and ability to purposefully weave it into their lessons the way it used to be say twenty, thirty years ago.  I believe our kids are hungry and at times desperate for meaning, purpose in both large and small meanings of those words.  Adding it back, in a more tempered, focused manner with instructors trained to do it well, such as the way described in the article has great merit, great value, and an vast audience waiting to know ""why?""    I believe the attempt to weave this all back into our lessons, our class structure, our basic approach of our public educational system at large, would pay off in a myriad of possibilities across the entire curriculum.  Just helping children, adolescents, and teens come to grips with the power of logic and reasoning, pulling the curtain back to occasionally introduce some of those brilliant philosophers who originally ""walked the walk"" can lead to a greater, more well rounded education.   To ask those eternally interesting and baffling questions of ""What is Morality"" while reading Othello, or ""What constitutes life?"" in biology needs to happen.  Philosophy, the original branch of all education can and should help us better understand our existence.  What could be wrong with a Math teacher detailing a few logical proofs in a lesson?  a social studies teacher asking ""What is justice?"" while teaching the Trail of Tears?  I believe we are all philosophers, every single one of us, walking this world ill-equipped and un-prepared by our society to come to grips with our beliefs and notions of greater philosophic baggage we know not how to unpack or organize.  If Socrates is to be believed, helping children in elementary middle and high schools better learn to utilize those tools philosophic is most what they and we need for a good life well lived."

Your statements about Marxism seem to reflect an overall lack of understanding of the field, so I would heavily recommend checking out such subreddits as /r/communism101, /r/Anarchy101, etc."
philosophy,3d2vyk,anarchoqueer,-1,Tue Jul 14 19:49:50 2015 UTC,"The link was in jest, obviously, but the list is telling.  If application of a philosophy leads to undesirable results, philosophers tend to blame the application and not the philosophy.    In science, a theory that continuously fails to be accurate is deemed to be incorrect, and science moves on.   In philosophy, philosophers make excuses by ignoring the metaphysical reality and adopting some hyperreality in which Marxism/Socialism/Communism are not related so they can pretend it is still a valid idea."
philosophy,3d2vyk,WallyReflector,6,Mon Jul 13 21:16:04 2015 UTC,"Hyperreality means something very different in philosophy than how you're using it.

philosophy,3d17eg,Snow_Mandalorian,8,Sun Jul 12 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"I don't find the first critique of marriage very convincing.  The author is right in pointing out that legally marriage is not clearly a 'loss' for women.  However, he takes umbrage with the symbolic nature of marriage, which often hearkens back to a time when full legal rights were not enjoyed by women.    I see two problems with this,  1)  Isn't this symbolism empty?  The meaning of these traditions and gestures have died, but we are left reciting the words.  It would stand to reason that soon even the words will die out too.    2)  Related to this, such symbolism is not a necessary component of marriage.  So instead of this being a damning critique of marriage, it would only be a critique of the arcane traditions that used to surround it.          Thus, for example, there would be one set of regulations for the child-rearing function, another for the property-sharing function, another for the sexual-intimacy function and so on. There would be no particular ex ante restrictions on who could share these functions. The regulations for each function would have to be developed and argued for independently.    I am left wondering why these relationships need to be regulated at all (I also have no idea what regulations he thinks need to be made for the ""sexual-intimacy function."").  The need for state recognition is just outright assumed by the author, which is somewhat disappointing.  Why power structures are necessary at all to perpetuate or validate human relationships is something we should reflect on.  There are some practical concerns, wills and bed-side visits- but I have little doubt that organically society is capable of finding a way to address these needs.  Lastly, there is a serious philosophic objection to piece-meal recognition.  The author isn't only concerned about practical implications but also the symbolism and privilege that comes from state-recognized statuses.  Won't these new, individuated statuses still privilege those with children against those without, etc.?  In my opinion he doesn't go far enough down this road."
philosophy,3d17eg,Ihatecheese86,2,Sun Jul 12 23:31:49 2015 UTC,"Good observation of the tension between a la carte marriage vs. extending marriage rights. The latter view takes marriage seriously, even reverently, as Kennedy did when SCOTUS legalized gay marriage:   No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were.   On the other hand, Chambers wants legal recognition for pragmatic quasi-marriages. Now I don't see anything necessarily wrong with experiments in piecemeal marriage - they may turn out to be superior to traditional marriage in some cases - but I'm not convinced they deserve legal recognition. Bundling the parenting aspects of marriage in with the emotional and financial ones helps to promote secure and stable environments for children, and the state has a legitimate interest in doing this."
philosophy,3d17eg,yoshi_win,2,Sun Jul 12 23:54:25 2015 UTC,"A lot of the critique of marriage is currently irrelevant, IMO, and was largely historically irrelevant. For instance, the article states:    Historically, there were many practical harms to women who entered into marriage. The most obvious of these were legal. Married women lost legal status and effectively became the chattel of their husbands.    This makes it sound like they had meaningful legal rights and recourses before marriage. It also seems to imply that the average male had legal rights and recourses.  Your average 16th century West European farmers & fishermen had some basic rights as serfs -- their lords were obliged to give them generally the period between Christmas Eve & New Years day off from work, and they were to receive every Sunday free from work. Nobles were not allowed to arbitrarily murder/rape them. They could not be sold or forcibly relocated. There were established rules on the length of time they could be forced to labor specifically for their direct lords or the King.   In marriage, none of these basic rights for the women were somehow sacrificed. Nor were the rights of men in any way embellished.   Feminists richly imagine a scenario where men rule over them cruelly and arbitarily, as opposed to labor along with them  to make the best of their lives. Of course, I am sure there are many instances of abusive husbands, but just as such, why should we assume this to be the norm? And why should we figure such a thing to be even legally protected?   Apparently there has been recovered laws from hundreds of years ago that strictly regulated physical abuse that could occur to a wife: http://www.historyofwomen.org/wifebeatingthumb.html  I guess I would use the old Korean grandparents as a measure of what amount of wife beatings perhaps took place 500 years ago, because many were raised with legal precedents and infrastructure that ignores recent conceptions of it... And in my experience, it isn't that common to beat or hit your wife.   Perhaps I am wrong, but this silly portrait of marriage as invariably exploitive is off to me.   (2) I believe it was Aristotle that said the greatest inequality is to make equal things that are unequal.   Homosexuality & alternative forms of marriage do not possess the same social benefit to the greater social order.   Marriage is sanctioned because it is within the traditional family structure that tends to rear and inculcate children with the values that we desire collectively for our soceity, hence the favoring of the conservatives of traditional marriage institutions.   The Left assumes too much that the purpose of government is the endless embellishment of personal liberty, and that if things meet some 'no harm' policy towards other existing rights, it must certainly be allowed. Everything is constructed around a very narrow view of liberty without much of a concept of the classical view of what a State is."

But it can't. Because one of our values is sexual chastity, and we believe in the natural order of man & woman coming together in a union to raise children, because all children benefit from having both a mother and a father in their home because they learn and familiarize themselves with men and women in this way.   For a very similar reason divorce is frowned upon because it breaks up the family and deprives a child of their paternal or maternal presence. Divorce should really only occur in cases of domestic abuse, neglect, etc.    Does the traditional marriage institution ask the question ""Do you plan on having children?"" to the people who enter into it? Does the traditional marriage institution prohibit those incapable of child bearing from entering into it? I'm sure you've heard these objections before, but I'm curious to see how you answer them - after all, if this were the primary function, don't you think we'd enshrine it into law?   No, the traditional marriage never asked if they planned on having children because it was a foregone conclusion.  It doesn't have to be enshrined into law, either, because some people are infertile or financially unready to have children, and still others might have personal issues that prevent them. Marriage also fulfills the role of providing personal and sexual fulfillment to the couple, but certainly this is secondary to forming the building blocks of society in the creation of families.   In modern times it is accustomed for peopel to wait and tarry on the issue, and some to even, as selfish and sick people, abstain from creating children. But if you familiarize yourself with any organic, traditional society that hasn't been warped & perverted with opulence, nearly every man and woman seek to marry and reproduce rather early, including all of the men and women who are college educated.   Because when you have a son or daughter it is a great pride to you, and a great creation for the whole family to enjoy and love. You boast of it to your friends and coworkers. That's how it should be.    Also, do you disagree with the piecemeal approach highlighted in the article? Because it sounds like there's only one function - the child-rearing function, as the article describes it - that you're interested in. Would it irk you if we broke that part away from the other parts the article describes, like property sharing, or is there some need for them to be kept together?   I think that property sharing is the legalistic aspect. In a traditional society men and women divorced very seldomly. Division of property in the event of divorce seems like a very odd point of obsession.   Likewise, I do not see why even two roommates cannot have their own shared & individual property arrangements.   In general I am not interested in laws when I figure that rational people can solve these issues themselves. I see how it is relevant, though, btu I won't be much of a contributor on a discussion about it because it is also disinteresting to me.    John Stuart Mill articulated the harm principle, and I'm not sure that he would be a part of what most Americans would call the Left. Libertarians (which are, rightly or wrongly, lumped in as the odd cousin of the Republican party in our current discourse) would agree with this idea as well.

I'm no political philosopher, so I may not be able to answer you cogently, but you should at least put it out there.   Right; I reject the no harm policy. I also reject the assumption that this was the intention of our founding fathers.  The founding fathers envisioned themselves setting up a Republic in the same vein as Rome or Greece. This is why slavery and the 3/5s law was so easy to be approved, and this is also why voting tended to be limited everywhere to land owning white Christian males. In fact, the separation of Church & state clause was created in part to allow Catholics & Quakers to vote, because many states had developed laws which only allowed Protestants to vote or hold office.   The general assumption was a very Roman one: land owning men of sound religious character have the right to free speech, bear arms, vote, not be searched, etc. because it could be trusted that they would be the loyal citizens guiding the country, and that no one else would even really be a citizen.  Perhaps even the 'no harm' principle would work in this very qualified context, and appeal to the Libertarianesque foundign fathers. It could be trusted that well-off white men who affirmed public morals & religious principles would be free to act as they pleased -- a very qualified interpretation, and a limited sense of 'no harm.'   The concept of egalitarian rights-for-all, and the idea that a pregnant unmarried 18 year old girl can vote, and that a street prostitute & her pimp must have their rights seriously contemplated is absolutely ludicrous in the context of the original American Republic.   As far as I personally go... I tend to favor Plato.   People come together to form governments because it improves their quality of life exponentially; and the most important thing is wisdom and the quality of the human soul, and the second most important thing is the quality and comfort of the human body, and the very least but still important thing is wealth, but to ever prioritize wealth above the soul or the body is unwise and disastrous.   I think the State should legislate morality -- this does not mean we literally need secret police sneaking into your bedroom or neighbors snitching and spying on you. It just means that people are taught categorically what morality is, and that public vice is disapproved of and eradicated.   I think the direction of the US went inevitably rotten and the founding principles are a joke today."

I'd even say that the homemaker or the mother is the ultimate role. All other occupations exist to support this one.  I'd love to go back to a society where a man can make enough money to support his family by even doing relatively unskilled labor. I'd love for him to be able to work just nine to five, Monday through Friday, and be able to enjoy plenty of rest.   I do not feel negativity towards stay at home fathers or women in the military. Although it defies historical precedent there isn't any inherently wrong.    Woah, hold up.

Right -- a good example of people who do not get married and benefit society are the monks, nuns, Priests, Bishops, etc. that comprise various religious orders. People who take vows of celibacy and work in these capacities are fabulous.   However, anyone who doesn't take a vow of celibacy should get married, and the natural fruit of marriage is children. Having sex outside of committed relationships isn't beneficial for people or the social structure of the society. I'll be honest -- as surely as the sun will rise and set, we shall have sexual sin, but the point of the statement here is to uphold the ideal.   Just as a Marxist would say that we should strive for absolute equality and holding all in common together with the knowledge that this is perhaps not immediately and not perfectly fulfillable, so a social conservative understands that we assert an ideal that we might not entirely meet.    This sounds like covert gender-roles talk - that is to say, any society ""that hasn't been warped and perverted with feminism or women's liberation."" Perhaps I'm being overly cynical.   I said opulence because I believe in the classic Platonic view that sometimes, in fact often times, victory can bring with it defeat. Many Greeks & Romans felt that if a society wins too many wars, gains too many lands, etc. its happy middle is disrupted and the society's values begin to play second fiddle to the wealth and power of the nation.   So, I think that excessive wealth is the cause of most of our social ills.    What about having their own shared sexual arrangements? If the majority is abandoning chastity as an ideal, then this seems to be the next logical step.   Right, and if the majority of people in the United States & Western Europe live that way, then fine. It is against my ideals and the way that I live my life, and the ideals of my family. Now it just sounds like you are gloating that I am an ever-increasing minority.   I don't mind, though, because the current state of affairs in the US alligns perfectly with my beliefs. I believe what I do now because of what I have seen and learned.    You seem to be tied up on religious ideals. ""limited everywhere to land owning white Christian males."" ""land owning men of sound religious character."" ""who affirmed public morals and religious principles."" I don't know if this simply your retelling of history, or a specific hangup of yours, but it bothers me all the same.

Thankfully, Christian dominion groups aren't yet taking to violence the same way that ISIS and their cohort has.   That was the way it was, though. They barred Catholics & Quakers from holding office in some places. If I am historically wrong, then point it out. I am well aware some of the foundign fathers were deists. But this deism was very important to them also in the sense that it is how many justified human rights -- if man is nothing but a soulless animal, then the questions of right and wrong become more arbitrary.   And sure, there are millions of people who want to live in a secular society.  But remember, there are two kinds of secular societies -- there is that of thinkers like Chadwick that imply an almost sort of hostility and antagonism between religion and state, and imply that religion has outlived any usefulness in the society. Then there are those of Edmunde Burke who largely feel that secularism merely means that in the role of government we should not let religion actively play a role because it is no tbeneficial to religion or government, but that religion would still play a large role defining the motives and inclinations of peoples.   The latter definition is largely how even non-Western societies like Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, etc. see secularization. It is very white & Eurocentric to believe in the former.   I also do not hold anything against the Muslim peoples who, in Muslim lands, enforce their Muslim traditions. In Iran, for instance, there are many Christians who live peacefully. There is a major park in Tehran named after Mother Mary. Christians freely eat pork and can legally drink alcohol, and the captain of the Iranian football team is a Christian.   If Iran wants to have Islamic laws and promote Islam as the moral and right path with their schools & media, that's fine.   If the BJP in India wants to promote Hinduism as their national expression and work to revitalizing traditional elements of their society, that's just fabulous.   When the Sri Lankans promote Buddhism, I am satisfied.   These things benefit me because, as a conservative, I agree with them, and want to promote my version of the values that we all share that are very similar. I consider myself a mutual traditionalist who respects elements of everyone's rich custom and culture, because I feel that they naturally evolved in a way to promote values that are timeless and positive.    The big problem is that we can't even really agree on what the contents of morality are. Surely you would disagree with Peter Singer leading the government's Council on Moral Affairs and putting the harm principle into law. In the same way, I would disagree with the Pope being appointed as an advisor to the CMA and banning contraception and abortion. Either the decrees of the CMA are so bland as to be uncontroversial, or you end up ""disapproving"" and ""eradicating"" the behaviours of some minority and developing something tyrannical.    Right.  But as it stands, a morality is always being promoted. The 'objective' doesn't exist in any meaningful way beyond absolute physical truths and statements about them, as Wittgenstein pointed out.   You can say, ""John is 179.23 cm tall,""   But you cannot say, ""John is immoral for being a murderer and a thief,"" and say that this is an absolutely objective truth.   When the White House was lit up with the colors of the rainbow flag, it was a moral statement that tries to establish a new norm and remove an old one.   When the Confederate flag was taken down, this was likewise a government led activist moment where a specific viewpoint was advanced over another.  This is the default nature of government, and that is why I see nothing wrong with it when I suggest my social conservative viewpoints be officially advocated by the government. Because, in practice, it is not seen as wrong to impose the viewpoints of one group on another, and try to indoctrinate the people."

Perhaps this was true for a time when the most likely thing to result from sex was a child, but contraceptive techniques are quite effective these days.

Depending upon how you choose to react to this situation, you may well end up  in the throes of the Euthyphro dilemma. I see no reason why we should follow the dictates of a God and call them our ""morality"" - although codifying moral reason is a long and hard task, divine command theory only appears to  make it easier by turning morality on its head and making it into something else.   The latter definition is largely how even non-Western societies like Thailand, Sri Lanka, India, etc. see secularization. It is very white & Eurocentric to believe in the former.   I don't know if I ever endorsed a ""hostility and antagonism between religion  and state,"" so let me clear up what I mean here. Under a democratic society, it is important that people be able understand the reasons for its laws and make a case against them, at least in principle - there may be large amounts of legal precedent that make this difficult, but somebody dedicated enough should be able to understand the arguments for a law. The alternative is that you end up with an oligarchy, where the reasoning behind laws is understood only by a select class.  Injecting religious reasoning into the legal process makes for a dangerous precedent - for example, if somebody were to make a case against a policy by saying that it is against God's will, it suddenly becomes impossible for all citizens to understand the argument, as their vision of God's will (if there is such as thing) may be radically different, and the only way to make a cogent argument against it is to debunk one religion's doctrine.   If Iran wants to have Islamic laws and promote Islam as the moral and right path with their schools & media, that's fine.    What about a few Hindus in Iran, who want to hold onto their family traditions? If Islam is officially promoted by the state, then what are the chances that they could establish a Hindu temple without becoming ostracized, or perhaps even punished?   I consider myself a mutual traditionalist who respects elements of everyone's rich custom and culture, because I feel that they naturally evolved in a way to promote values that are timeless and positive.    And the best way to respect everyone's rich custom and culture is to create places where people's rights are potentially in danger because they go against  the doctrine of their local leaders?   Also, saying that, because they ""naturally evolved,"" the values they promote are ""timeless and positive,"" is to invoke the naturalistic fallacy. Wars have occurred all throughout history, from squabbles between tribes to world wars. I wouldn't say that their natural origin implies that violence between nations is a timeless and positive practice.   When the White House was lit up with the colors of the rainbow flag, it was a moral statement that tries to establish a new norm and remove an old one.  When the Confederate flag was taken down, this was likewise a government led activist moment where a specific viewpoint was advanced over another.   Ah, but no competing viewpoints were ""eradicated,"" were they? The KKK is protesting at the South Carolina state capitol soon, with no eradication in sight. Government officials may take positions, but that doesn't mean that they can use their power to muzzle their opposition. The First Amendment, whatever bruises it may have taken in recent times, still means something.   This is the default nature of government, and that is why I see nothing wrong with it when I suggest my social conservative viewpoints be officially advocated by the government. Because, in practice, it is not seen as wrong to impose the viewpoints of one group on another, and try to indoctrinate the people.    Then the question arises - why is your particular imposition a legitimate? If you are in the minority, as you yourself have stated, how can you hope to get anything done in a democracy? And can you manage to successfully impose your views on others while respecting their rights?"

You'll have to forgive my amazement - this sounds shockingly Darwinist.   It is actually from a quotation by C. S. Lewis. It is a very traditionalist perspective. I think you are used to dealing with a lot of typical American libertarian types.    Religious orders are the only organizations which can outrank the social benefits of child bearing? What exactly is it that they do which is so vital?   Form the best social welfare system, and are the glue that brings communities together better than anything else by promoting the cultural and traditional heritage.    A few posts above, you were willing to accept marriages between people which were infertile or financially unready to have children. Now you say that their marriages are unnatural. Would you mind clearing up this point?   No, I am saying that the most natural product and result of marriage is having children; people who are infertile / don't want to have children are an exception to the general results, but they are not somehow morally wrong in this circumstances.    Perhaps this was true for a time when the most likely thing to result from sex was a child, but contraceptive techniques are quite effective these days. My best guess is that this somehow results in ""sexual sin,"" but I don't share your theological underpinnings - the word ""sin"" doesn't mean anything to me, since I don't have a context to place it in. I fear that a significant chunk of our conversation is going to end this way - pinning our responses to divergent base beliefs and worldviews - but we'll see about that when we get there.   Oh, it doesn't even have to have anything to do with sin in the abstract, metaphysical & theological sense of wht a sin is. Even if there is no god, it is still ultimately negative for society. Studies show that women who have had fewer sex partners have more fulfilling marriages and are more likely happy to be happy in it than women who have not (though numbers tend not to change for men, probably because they naturally are inclined to predatory sexual behavior).   I also just think if you see the nature of human interaction, it is very much, at its animal root, not unlike that of any primates. Stripped bare of our rationality and more advanced human construct, it would be a situation where basically half the men have sex with the majority of women, and the other half are reduced to having no healthy role. And men, having no inclination to really be fathers to anyone they do not know is their own biological offsprign for certain, nor even having as strong of parental drives as women in general, just will never have the incentives to rear children well...   Fostering good marriages and practicing sexual chastity will always be objectively good for the soceity.   There is no reason to believe that because we now have contraceptions that we can just mate without much thought and the results are going to not have huge ramifications and impacts to the social structure of our soceity.   Especially look at today where men and women have even fewer incentives to get married, lol."

Do you resent the fact that you live in a democracy? I can see how you would.   Here is a fun thing: you know Noam Chomsky? He believes that the American democratic system largely thrives off of manufactured consent. It is precisely here that we are in agreement -- I do not believe that there is even really a democracy, but rather that it is a competitive oligarchy that depends on the mass manipulation of people that it has largely been doing via mass media since the 1930s.  (While there were some forms of 'mass media' before the 1930s, what makes this decade special was cheap, consumer radio and all of the accompanying radio operas that started out inoccuously but quickly became tools of greater influence that penetrated further than narratives put out in newspapers.)

For the record, I do not think that atheism is inherently a social evil. I think it is utterly inevitable that some people will just not believe in it. There have always been atheists. However, the important concept is that it is not popularized or promoted to the general populace.   It's not a beneficial philosophy to the public. Pretty much any religious system is preferable to it. But I do not hold people who are atheists in contempt -- I merely feel that most people like blunt ideas.  By this I mean that the average person thinks that someone like Jon Leibowitz (Jon Stewart) is witty and intelligent when the whole of his work is flippant denunciations of things. Same with Rush Limbaugh. None fo this is intelligence, it is just shallow rhetoric.   Most people are incapable of a meaningful grasp of most theologies, so the promotion of atheism can be a pretty potent undermining fo the establishment, so ti shouldn't be promoted.   The rich irony that atheists do not understand: they have gained ground because people are ignorant of theology, not because people have had their eyes opened.   Given that you think people need to be influenced and controlled, do you have an alternative? If people's religious sentiments keep declining, do you have a backup plan for putting them back onto the ""religious, moral end""?   It is a question of time.   Religiosity naturally waxes and wanes with social trends and other factors.   I think that sometime in the 2030s and 2040s there will be a far greater and more dynamic reactionary movement comprising a very palpable amount of the population -- and movements like  Golden Dawn in Greece will be literally winning the very popular elections. But this is all hinging on whether things will go unchanged from now.   Thanks for the fun exchange. :)"

Soldiering to men is like child bearing to women: it is the most basic and fundamental expression of a man to train for warfare or to practice something like hunting.   Obviously, fighting a war for selfish reasons and motivations is not correct, but we cannot deny that extremely complex geopolitical situations naturally develop, whether over scarce resources or just the natural drift towards dispute.   While perhaps we should avoid wafare because it does have obvious negative results, and we should do so only gravely, the new method fo pretending that war is always the most horrific thing imaginable is a bit off.

They were a potent political force in the 1920s, and that even lasted longer. However, to say that they are even relevant is like saying that Westboro Baptist Church is relevant.   They are, more often than not, a media invocation meant to rally their liberal voting base.   It's also noteworthy that people with openly anti-GLBTQ views, and of course anyone with openly racist or sexist views since the early 90s, cannot hold a job or be expected to say anything they believe in public without dramatic, knee jerk reactions.

philosophy,3d17eg,kulturkampf,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:27:59 2015 UTC,"The symbolic meaning might now be considered empty and widely accepted that it is unnecessary, considering the ramifications of marriage on the couple only. The effect of the symbolism is effective in outer relationships as well, to the interpretations of those surrounding the couple. The easiest comparison I can make would be to the legalisation of same-sex marriage - marriage as it exists in Western society is derived from Christianity, and considers it to be a human goal (sex before marriage is evil, etc). Therefore the legalisation of same sex marriage is a way to demonstrate that homosexuality as 'evilness' is not permissable. I think it's easy to critique the traditions of marriage, but in terms of the rest of society we can't foresee a change in attitudes to the institution of marriage in the near future.  It would be good to see, if marriage is state regulated, that it would change into a renewable contract structure - rather than a catch all permanent agreement. The terms of the contract custom to each individual, and able to expire over time. Marriage after all is just a form of contract. A libertarian form of marriage, I agree with the author, still would hold it's own issues in regards to the more vulnerable partner, and the struggle of having to 'opt in' - or even just more options making it more difficult to process for those who don't want to look at legal terms. That's a problem for all society's issues though - how far do we go to protect the vulnerable before government becomes controlling, when as long as there are vulnerable people, there will also be people looking to take advantage of them."

A couple who are dating decide that their relationship is serious enough to take division of assets into consideration, so they see some kind of mediator and have a contract drafted stipulating the terms of their new, financially binding contractual relationship. The state's role is limited to defining limits; i.e., no marrying kids, no marrying animals etc.   I see at least two benefits coming from this:   It gets rid of much of the awkwardness over 'pre-nuptial agreements' as it forces a 'asset and custody agreement' into the marriage itself. It discourages the ceremonial aspects of marriage which may lead to much less money wasted on weddings.   Beyond that though it just cuts down dramatically on the bureaucracy, whose excesses are (I assume) part of the reason we're having this conversation in the first place."

Or: ""It's logical, but logic has nothing to do with reality."" You got it from Kant. Or: ""It's evil, because it's selfish."" You got it from Kant.    Those are complete caricatures of his view, but I'll let that slide for a moment because what she says about other philosophers in this passage are also caricatures, and supposedly tongue-in-cheek.   For some two hundred years, under the influence of Immanuel Kant, the dominant trend of philosophy has been directed to a single goal: the destruction of man's mind, of his confidence in the power of reason. Today, we are seeing the climax of that trend.   Yeah, Kant was so confident in the power of reason that he wrote the Critique of Pure Reason.   One of the most dangerous things a man can do is to surrender his moral autonomy to others: like the astronaut in my story, he does not know whether they are human, even though they walk on two feet.   It's ironic that Rand values autonomy so much, given that autonomy is a central concept of Kantian ethics.   In physical warfare, you would not send your men into a booby trap: you would make every effort to discover its location. Well, Kant's system is the biggest and most intricate booby trap in the history of philosophy — but it's so full of holes that once you grasp its gimmick, you can defuse it without any trouble and walk forward over it in perfect safety. And, once it is defused, the lesser Kantians — the lower ranks of his army, the philosophical sergeants, buck privates, and mercenaries of today — will fall of their own weightlessness, by chain reaction.   And of course she doesn't mention that gimmick here.    There is a special reason why you, the future leaders of the United States Army, need to be philosophically armed today. You are the target of a special attack by the Kantian-Hegelian-collectivist establishment that dominates our cultural institutions at present. You are the army of the last semi-free country left on earth, yet you are accused of being a tool of imperialism — and ""imperialism"" is the name given to the foreign policy of this country, which has never engaged in military conquest and has never profited from the two world wars, which she did not initiate, but entered and won. (It was, incidentally, a foolishly overgenerous policy, which made this country waste her wealth on helping both her allies and her former enemies.)    I have no idea how Rand defines ""collectivist"", but given that Kant thinks of freedom as the basis of the state and emphasizes property rights, I'm pretty sure that the label ""collectivist"" doesn't fit him.   Something called ""the military-industrial complex"" — which is a myth or worse — is being blamed for all of this country's troubles. Bloody college hoodlums scream demands that R.O.T.C. units be banned from college campuses. Our defense budget is being attacked, denounced and undercut by people who claim that financial priority should be given to ecological rose gardens and to classes in esthetic self-expression for the residents of the slums.   Given that she doesn't mention who wants to change financial priority, I have no reason to believe that they are anything but strawmen.   Some of you may be bewildered by this campaign and may be wondering, in good faith, what errors you committed to bring it about. If so, it is urgently important for you to understand the nature of the enemy. You are attacked, not for any errors or flaws, but for your virtues. You are denounced, not for any weaknesses, but for your strength and your competence. You are penalized for being the protectors of the United States. On a lower level of the same issue, a similar kind of campaign is conducted against the police force. Those who seek to destroy this country, seek to disarm it — intellectually and physically. But it is not a mere political issue; politics is not the cause, but the last consequence of philosophical ideas. It is not a communist conspiracy, though some communists may be involved — as maggots cashing in on a disaster they had no power to originate. The motive of the destroyers is not love for communism, but hatred for America. Why hatred? Because America is the living refutation of a Kantian universe.   Of course, Rand doesn't mention how it refutes Kant.   Today's mawkish concern with and compassion for the feeble, the flawed, the suffering, the guilty, is a cover for the profoundly Kantian hatred of the innocent, the strong, the able, the successful, the virtuous, the confident, the happy. A philosophy out to destroy man's mind is necessarily a philosophy of hatred for man, for man's life, and for every human value. Hatred of the good for being the good, is the hallmark of the twentieth century. This is the enemy you are facing.    Rand has no idea what she is talking about.

Understanding doesn't come quick and easy like that, and Objectivists of all people should be sensitive to this fact given the raging ignorance out there about Rand steeped in minimal intellectual effort, heuristics almost.  It doesn't work that way with philosophy.  If such minimal-effort heuristics got them to Aristotle/Aristotelianism, then we could talk about the effectiveness of such approaches.  When pigs fly.  As for sources on Kant: Paul Guyer, Allen Wood, Christine Korsgaard, Karl Ameriks, Thomas Hill, and Marcia Baron have all authored highly-reputed works on Kant's philosophy (a number of these on his ethics).

philosophy,3cxe82,imdrinkingteaatwork,10,Sun Jul 12 04:58:06 2015 UTC,"How does one laugh at something and ignore the very thing he is laughing at? Laughter is a specific response to the acknowledgement of something. By genuinely laughing at absurdity, one deliberately affirms its existence and chooses neither to fear it, nor to succumb to its many anxieties. In this sense, laughter is the assertion of the ego; this is the crux of existentialism. To be a true, free individual is to provide meaning, which is rooted in the self; this is the purpose of religion for many. Laughing at absurdity is the placement of the ego, the self, over the absurd. This is the root of all dark, or 'gallows' humor."

I commented under the assumption that you were saying laughing and accepting was not philosophical suicide, when you were in fact.... wait now I am confused again.  I guess what I should say, even though I am confused and not really aware if I am arguing with or against you, is that attempting to accept the absurdity of reality is a fruitless endeavor.  It is still philosophical suicide as it is attempting to give meaning to the absurd.  I'm aware that this may just be arguing semantics but I feel as though the more correct sentiment would be to exist while acknowledging the absurdity of reality without being [philosophically/existentially] burdened by the implications.   I was using ""ignore"" incorrectly before, and another user brought that to my attention.  We decided ""acknowledge"" is more apropos."

philosophy,3cxe82,pryoRichard,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:37:00 2015 UTC,Isn't the acceptance of Camus's philosophy in and of itself philosophical suicide? It seems as if some of his opinions of our existence are almost self refuting.

The example about a prisoner deciding to enjoy his sentence is the same thing.   Aren't both still reacting to an external thing imposed on them? Is Camus saying choosing to be happy in the face of external misery is ok and this is what's absurd?   I'm hung up in that doesn't ""being happy"" require ""contentment"" and that'd mean you'd have to decide to be content with having a search for meaning? Doesn't Camus say that the search itself isn't a thing to embrace?  Is he really saying that ""being happy"" is actually not connected to ""having a meaning"" whereas a non-introspective person will accept some easy external meaning like religion or consumerism and be led to false happiness? Then what is absurd is being a human mismatched to living in a meaningless universe, embracing that while still looking and then still deciding to be happy without having a reason to be?"
philosophy,3cxe82,kidfay,11,Sun Jul 12 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"Camus isn't using happiness in it's usual definition.

philosophy,3cxe82,rsynv5,3,Sun Jul 12 04:38:03 2015 UTC,"It was a couple of years ago I read Sisyphus. It sounds like you're saying come at in sort of a ""live in the moment"" direction. I can't recall Camus discussing that. If you mean sort of a 'embrace being occupied' I can see that in Camus. That's what Sisyphus does but it's sort of a temporary or artificial task compared to existing--whatever god imposed that sentence on him whereas he had years of different life before. I remember my take away opinion was that what he was writing meant that despite knowing we won't find any meaning in the universe, we should find ""happiness"" in embracing the struggle of seeking one. (But this video seemed to say simply accepting the struggle as a struggle would be philosophic suicide.)  What I got from Camus is that the absurd arises from mismatch and humans who operate in a world of meanings while the universe in which we find ourselves is devoid of any creates maximum mismatch--life as human is then fundamentally absurd.  The prisoner analogy is interesting and it's been a while since I've read Camus and I liked it when I did so I'm interested in learning more. Also especially since I last read philosophy a few years ago I got a job in which I have found a lot of meaning and contentment so I have that new perspective to also consider and work into philosophic ruminations. If I enjoy my work and find it satisfying am I committing philosophic suicide? The job hasn't taken over my life but I greatly enjoy doing it.

I imagine you could enjoy the work you do and still be an absurd man. Philosophical suicide is just giving up what agency you have by choosing to accept that you/humanity in general have some knowable greater purpose.

philosophy,3cxe82,rsynv5,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:44:41 2015 UTC,"I honestly, think Camus work is slightly flawed. Coming from a very pessimistic viewpoint.   I think his works really try address explain the cognitions and conditions at which at which a human, ruminates and reasons down (like the video says) that all tasks performed (the shoes and gym part of posted video) have no meaning as all these actions seem so trival in the face of death. Which means being alive is meaningless, and why should a human bother doing anything at all. For some humans the cognitive dissodance (and the following emotional discomfort (ambivilance) caused by two opposing attitudes (the need for meaning, and the realization there is none) what Satre would call the 'anguish' causes a certain amount of psychological repression almost a denial to occur. And the questioning of life is put on the back boiler (The Philosophical Suicide), and said people return to a state of 'being in the world' as Heidegger wrote (being totally immersed in life)   By not looking beneath the surface of events or thier own actions and what or why they occur. Those that manage this normally function pretty well in the world. Im sure pretty much most adults experience these cognitions from time to time, but manage to repress it fairly well.  This is what i believe Terror Management Theory, and the work of Ernest Becker really relates to.  Those people don't need Camus in my opinion, they have a mechanism in thier mind that protects them from the Absurd.  However, Camus works are often read, i'd say as a last ditch, by those who have not been able to repress the Absurd and have become existensial nihilists as a sort of short term therapy, the problem i believe with Camus here. Is....these people don't become nihlistic because life is abusurd. But become nihilistic, because life (thier lives especially) are so rife with suffering. So, why ought we/they bother carrying on with such a ridiculous ordeal. They have become bored of the everyday sufferings. To put it into perspective i'll repeat what acadmemyofideas put in his video on which he echos ideas of Neitzche and Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer said ""the need for meaning in life is caused by the awareness of death with the addtion of the awareness of suffering"". Then Neitzche came along and streamlined it to, 'the meaning of life is really the meaning of meaning of suffering', he then goes on to say 'man will endure, even seek out suffering, if there is a justification for it, if the suffering is worth something at the end' we see this everyday with people working out or slaving away at work and such.  The discomfort/suffering of these actions is okay because it can be justified with the promise to gain muscle/self esteem and money. They don't worry about life (they have philosophically quit/suicide) because they get what they want out of it.   In the existesial nihlists/abusrdists view though the suffering is not enought to justify the ends, because they just aren't appealing or rewarding enough to them. These individuals then have become bored of life as they cannot get what they need/want out of it, and are therefore condemed to see the aburdity of life over and over because cannot justify thier existence to themselves (and cannot philosophically quit). They are then left with the only other choice, which is to die.  And Camus analogy of sysiphus whislt accurate, offers little recompense. As it seems you cannot be happy with life, if you cannot bear the suffering it contains.  TL/DR   Camus explains why we see the absurd, but his solace is not stong enough."

philosophy,3cxe82,asingh21,11,Sat Jul 11 21:44:21 2015 UTC,"It is the other side of the same coin.  Accepting the absurdness is just as fruitless as denying the absurdness altogether.

Accepting the absurdity is just another way of pursuing meaning.  Non-acceptance here works as a philosophical grey area.

We still have to relentlessly pursue whatever provides value and meaning to our life and fight the absurd.   Value and meaning may or may not exist and the pursuit of such IS the absurd.  Pursuing that is the epitome of the absurd, fighting against it only cements it as such.   Isn't that what Camus says in the Myth Of Sisyphus.    Haha no, fighting against it would just be another way of attempting to find what can not be known: whether or not meaninglessness exists.  In the Myth of Sisyphus and The Stranger for that matter Camus uses both Sisyphus and Meursault to represent philosophical suicide.     ""One must imagine Sisyphus happy.""    By being happy, Sisyphus is altogether exempt from the absurdity, at least consciously.  Which is why he is not ruined by his meaningless task.   ""For everything to be consummated, for me to feel less alone, I had only to wish that there be a large crowd of spectators the day of my execution and that they greet me with cries of hate.""    Meursault is the other side of the coin; he is accepting meaninglessness, which is still an absurd pursuit.  Meursault feels vindicated and that vindication is him searching for meaning.  Only in the face of death does he rejoice at this possibility.  But alas, even the vindication of his own outlook is absurd.  The acceptance at that point is philosophical suicide.  Instead of still searching and questioning the existential realm, he relishes in the hate from the others.  That is his escape."

Meh.  Not really.  Those primal instincts evolved right along with us.  They are just as changing as the rest of the universe.  We are not compelled to make meaning out of anything; that is just a byproduct of our situation.  That right there is trying to force meaning on what is cosmically arbitrary.

How do you expect a Writer (such as proust) to create magnificent literature if not with the pursuit to guide others   Same implication.

Do we have to ignore our primal instincts of love and ambition.    I'm not quite following how you are using primal here.  Love and ambition are manufacture; they are not necessary for existence.  SO yes, ignore them, something them, those emotions are philosophical suicide.   Camus, like Don Juan, continuously pursued several Women in his life, He was known to express deep emotions. From a big enough perspective it appears that Camus did not just went along for the ride instead he passionately revolted against the absurd.   So?  I don't think he ever implied he was not too affected by philosophical suicide.  Never is it implied that philosophical suicide is negative, or to be fought against, just that it is part of the absurd endeavor of existence.

philosophy,3cxe82,imdrinkingteaatwork,3,Sun Jul 12 02:29:31 2015 UTC,"Hmmmm...  Well... giving credence to emotions like that is not really in the philosophical grey area at all. That is asserting that those feelings and emotions matter –that they have meaning– which we have deduced as unknowable at the very least. Those feelings arising are the predicament. They are part of the absurd. The grey area would be existing outside of them, which in Camus terms would be that state of constant philosophical questioning.   I think the confusion here is about the emotions arising. They are not caused by non-acceptance. They are caused by placing acceptance. The flip side of the coin thing. By getting emotional about non-acceptance one is in reality accepting that there is something to be emotional about."

No one way is better than the other.    Acknowledging the absurdity of something and continuing to DO that something is just as fruitless as suicide, philosophical or otherwise.    It's all fruitless, the pursuit of all meaning is absurd. That is the crux of the philosophy. In the face of that absurd reality all you can do is acknowledge it. Accepting or denying it is trying to understand it and find meaning through it. Which goes back to that being an absurd endeavor."

I feel the sentiments he expresses when I stare at the stars, and realize our insignificance in relation the universe. Then at other times when an issue should bother me, I can prevent it from bothering me because it's meaning doesn't have to exist or I don't have to accept it, because I can't be certain of it.

Christianity/religion in general is considered philosophical suicide because it relieves the basic tension between man's search for meaning and his inability to find any. In theory, I imagine Camus would accept that a religion which does not offer an explanation for human existence, or at least does not offer one which requires faith, would not be considered philosophical suicide."

And/or is it saying that religion is a method in committing philosophical suicide?   I mean, in regard to the evidence used to show that religion is philosophical suicide is false in terms of Christianity. Christianity does not as the video claims (well it makes this claim about religion in general, not Christianity specifically) cause mental suicide. Christians still question life, and have questions about the nature of life, but the difference is we have a guide. A source of knowledge and absolute truth that does not change. Just because we have this guide does not mean we stop questioning life. Though typically, there are many Christians who just stop trying to answers life questions, the Bible specifically states multiple times throughout books like the book of proverbs and Ecclesiastes, that knowledge should be sought after in a strong and persistent way. I don't think every religion causes any form of mental nor philosophical suicide."

The fact that you started questioning someone else's intelligence means to me that you began questioning your own, consciously or not, despite your irreverent attitude.

So if you're afraid of being a child, stop directing your questions outward.  That's what children do.  They direct all their questions not to themselves, but to their own parents.

philosophy,3ct0ax,qnot,58,Fri Jul 10 15:10:50 2015 UTC,"Here is a hint at a resolution: ""This sentence is false"" is perfectly true when referring to a (different) false statement, like ""2+2=5"".   The issue is the scope of the ""this"" in ""this sentence is false"": it acts as a free variable for which we can substitute any proposition. If we write ""this sentence is false"" as f(x), where x is the proposition we are referring to with ""this"", then when we try to make the sentence refer to itself we get f(f(x)). This thing is neither true nor false, because we never determined what x was. Wittgenstein gives a similar resolution you can find in Zettel.  ""This sentence is not true"" we might write as NT(x). Given that we think this thing is ""not true"", we can apply it to itself and say NT(NT(x)) is true. But this doesn't make the original NT(x) itself true.   EDIT FOR COMPLETENESS (PUN INTENDED IFF NOT INTENDED): Those who know something about the truth-functional calculus will see that I am identifying ""this sentence is false"" with the negation function, usually written as a ""~"".   Here is the idea of Wittgenstein I mentioned:  '691. ""The Cretan Liar"". He might have written ""This proposition is false"" instead of saying ""I am lying"". The answer would be: ""Very well, but which proposition do you mean?""---""Well, this proposition"".---""I understand, but which is the proposition mentioned in it?""---""This one""---""Good, and which proposition does it refer to?"" and so on. Thus he would be unable to explain what he means until he passes to a complete proposition.----We may also say: The fundamental error lies in one's thinking that a phrase e.g. ""This proposition"" can as it were allude to its object (point to it from far off) without having to go proxy for it.'  I am aware there are much nastier ways of stating the paradox. They are all good fun and at least make us pay attention to the way we use words. My own feeling is that there are a priori reasons for believing that none of these paradoxical statements can have a truth value: they tend to form a closed system, so that their truth or falsity could not possibly depend on anything else in logic or in the universe. Even if someone proved conclusively that one of these things had a truth value, what of it? They don't say anything about anything else; there is nowhere to go with your conclusion. It's hard to shake the feeling that, though these sentences cause us trouble, it is only trouble we have brought upon ourselves, since we never have to deal with them in practice (in everyday life I mean)."
philosophy,3ct0ax,grothendieckchic,19,Fri Jul 10 15:49:49 2015 UTC,"Interesting perspective. A related resolution that i sadly didnt cover was Tarski's concept of metalanguages in which sentences referring to other sentences are ""higher up"" and so the ""this"" doesnt refer to the sentence itself but rather a lower level statement, which resolves the issue of self reference  At least, that's my understanding of it. I didn't want to mess it up, so I omitted it from the video  Edit: If anybody is more familiar with Tarski's work, please do comment! I made this video to start a discussion about a topic I found interesting"
philosophy,3ct0ax,Chronophilia,3,Fri Jul 10 16:02:25 2015 UTC,"That's correct, and it sees a lot of use in mathematics - see the Axiom of Foundation for example.  The problem is that this is actually quite a severe restriction! It forbids you from building sentences from scratch, because then you can construct self-referential sentences with quining. The classic example is "" ""yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation"" yields falsehood when preceded by its quotation"". It doesn't use the word ""this"" or any other demonstratives.  Still, we can probably live without the ability to talk about arbitrary other sentences. That seems like a natural consequence of forbidding reference to specific other sentences."
philosophy,3ct0ax,Odds-Bodkins,3,Fri Jul 10 20:08:19 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest problem is that Tarski deems natural language ""inconsistent"" - and in fact any language which can refer to its own sentences, contains a truth-predicate and has a reasonable logical apparatus (""semantic closure"").  We need to cash out what Tarski means by a language being inconsistent - presumably, contains a sentence of form ""P and Not-P"" which isn't false. It's not true, either, so we're not forced into saying every English sentence is true (principle of explosion). But it gives a pretty good reason for exploring many-valued logics (e.g. true, false, and truth ""gluts"" and ""gaps"" - i.e. ""both"" and ""neither"").  There's been some suggestion that we implicitly index a ""level"" of truth-predicate, such that paradoxes can't be created because truth-predicating sentences at a given level n are in turn truth-predicated at n+1 - effectively, natural language contains an infinite hierarchy of metalanguages wherein each contains its own truth-predicate.   But that's a bit of a deus ex machina, and you can construct situations where we don't even know what level we'd require.  Kripke uses a trivalent logic and an iterative process of ""grounding"" of truth-values in his Outline of a Theory of Truth, wherein some sentences have ungrounded truth-values. It's an interesting take on Tarskian metalanguages, but it struggles with strengthened liars (""not true"" =/= false in the trivalent logic), universal truth-predication ""all true sentences are true"" and the machinery fails to capture some of our intuitions about conditionals (viz., material identity P => P)."
philosophy,3ct0ax,Kevin_Scharp,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:13:18 2015 UTC,"That's not Tarski's view. On a Tarskian approach, 'this' can refer to whatever you want, no sentence can be in the extension of the truth predicate for the language of that sentence.  So 'this sentence is false' ends up being false for the Tarskian."
philosophy,3ct0ax,Brian,6,Sat Jul 11 15:41:50 2015 UTC,"There are ways of expressing this paradox that don't use ""this sentence"" or refrenencing.  Eg. take Quines's version:   ""Yields falsehood when preceeded by its quotation"" yields falsehood when preceeded by its quotation.   Here we've got a version that works in terms of describing a sentence construction.  What ""it"" is referring to is explicit, rather than being free or ambiguous: it's always the sentence fragment ""Yields falsehood when preceeded by its quotation"".  It describes taking this sentence fragment and using it to construct a full sentence (ie. preceed it by the quotation of the fragment), and makes a truth claim about this constructed sentence when we evaluate its meaning (ie. it yields false).  No free variables, no self reference, but the sentence that this happens to construct if we follow the directions happens to be the same sentence making that assertion of falsehood, and so we reach the paradox when trying to assign a truth value to this sentence.  It's actually a fairly similar approach to Godel's incompleteness theorem, where the Godel number of a theorem does a similar job to quotation."
philosophy,3ct0ax,baddox,6,Fri Jul 10 21:49:08 2015 UTC,"The paradox happens because ""this"" in the sentence is not a free variable for which we can substitute any proposition. It refers specifically to the statement of which it is part. I wouldn't call your explanation a resolution."
philosophy,3ct0ax,skazzaks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:25:06 2015 UTC,"I think the explanation is not that great, especially the free variable part, but I think the Wittgenstein quote explains what they are trying to say. When you go to evaluation the proposition, you must first evaluate ""this proposition"", which in turn brings you to the full proposition again, where you must once again evaluate ""this proposition"", and so on. You are correct that it is not a free variable as originally described - it refers to the proposition. But in that very fact we can see that it refers to it infinitely, which is why the truth value is undecidable and why it is in fact a resolution."
philosophy,3ct0ax,baddox,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:47:51 2015 UTC,"Then it sounds like the resolution is simply the claim that you can't have self-reference, which is obviously extremely limiting. You can't even do basic arithmetic without doing self-reference, per Gödel's incompleteness theorems."
philosophy,3ct0ax,skazzaks,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:19:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think the conclusion is that all self-reference is ruled out. ""This sentence is a sentence"" is true after one level because the truth value doesn't need to be inspected further. The problem doesn't come just from the self-reference, but from the fact that the self-reference has exactly to do with the truth value of the statement, which makes it infinitely recursive.  Also, can you give me an example of basic arithmetic that requires self-reference? I don't know much about the incompleteness theorems."
philosophy,3ct0ax,baddox,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:06:23 2015 UTC,"""Basic arithmetic"" is probably bad phrasing. What Godel showed is that any system capable of proving some set of general propositions about the natural numbers [0] cannot be both consistent and complete. If it is consistent, then you can essentially define a way to encode logical statements into natural numbers and use that encoding to construct a self-referential ""Godel sentence"" which is true, but not provable by the system.   [0] Admittedly I don't actually know what the specific set of propositions about the natural numbers is that condemns a system to Godel's incompleteness, other than that it corresponds to what we think of as normal relations about the natural numbers. I believe Godel was specifically working with Peano arithmetic."

Namely, if I say ""alright, I'll consider 'this statement is false' to be false for future calculations, because it's self descriptive."" then the statement becomes true, thus making it false, thus making it true, etc. etc. The paradox is that the statement's truth value is not set, but rather oscillating.  If that doesn't satisfy you, I'll demonstrate why self-description cannot be used to set a truth value for a proposition within the statement.   ""This statement is 1,337 characters long.""

But in Fuzzy logics , X varies continuously from 0 to 1 (or sometimes -1 to 1, it doesn't matter, so we'll use [0..1]).  The logical operators are a little different in fuzzy logics. NOT(X) = 1-X. AND(X,Y) = MIN(X,Y). OR(X,Y) = MAX(X,Y).  This now allows the equation to be solved! If X = NOT(X), then X = 1-X, or 2X = 1, or X = 0.5.  A truth value of 0.5 means that the statement is neither true nor false, which makes a lot of logical sense, if you think about it."

Things are either true or they or false, and since the original question cannot be either one, due to the specific nature and small scope of the question itself, re-applying the sentence to itself doesn't undo the paradox.

We can use them to approximate a description of an object or an idea, but their adherence to logic, thought, or reality at large is not assured.  As such, it is possible to string together words in a way that is nonsense.  ""This sentence is false"" is one such example.  Even though it uses simple English words and seems to express a straightforward thought, it doesn't actually correspond to anything someone could actually think, much less any a configuration of matter or energy in the physical world.  To pick another example, I can utter the words, ""I am holding a square circle,"" but that doesn't mean my utterance actually means anything, at least not in a literal sense.

""X is a square circle"" is syntactically valid and semantically meaningful, I think, and equivalent to ""X is a square and X is a circle"", and by the rules it's false for all X. It is practically meaningless, though, but pragmatics is only for natural language, not basic logic.  ""This sentence is false"" is tricky. It's fine to rule it out in practice, but that doesn't help the logical analysis. On the face of it, it looks both syntactically valid and semantically meaningful, but it can't be assigned a truth value, which is big trouble.  Self-reference seems to cause the problems, and the usual approach has been to ban using X directly as part of its own definition. Self-reference is allowed, but through mechanisms that restrict it.

In other words, the second statement only means that the original statement is false, whereas the original statement means both that the original statement is true and false.  So the infinite loop of deciding that the statement is false if it is true and true if it is false doesn't make a full cycle (specifically, we can't conclude it's truth from its falsity).  It is false.  It also prevents the Liar Paradox's somewhat stronger Berry's Paradox version: ""If this statement is true, then it is false"", or A:A=>-A, which can't be resolved by some other resolutions to the Liar's Paradox.

Of course, you don't always want to use the word truth in this way (e.g. we sometimes say there is ""some truth"" to an idea), but I think this more strict concept is the one that actually needs to be focused on in logic.  However, it seems that things like opinions and sarcasms don't necessarily have readily understood statements in the relevant sense.  I don't even know what the real statement behind something like ""The Mona Lisa is beautiful"" would be.  Certainly we're not analyzing that utterance in a logical and analytical way when we'd normally hear it.  I'd say that a statement is more of a mental conception, needing to mentally define a clear set of truth values to the things it describes.

philosophy,3ct0ax,colttree6969,3,Sat Jul 11 00:51:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not a Nagarjuna expert by any means, just ordered Jan Westerhoff's introductory book actually haha. However, I can say that the ""middle way"" of the Buddha is basically the way between extremes, most specifically between eternalism/soul-theory and annihilationism/nihilism, and also between asceticism/self-torture and low-hedonism/pleasure-seeking. Although Buddha's way was generally pragmatic - i.e. how to put an end to dukkha:  as an aside, dukkha is often translated as suffering, but that is an incomplete understanding, it is actually the whole mass of that which is difficult to bear (flawedness, stress, dissatisfaction, ennui, suffering, pain, uneasiness, etc.)  He did teach an ontology (maybe phenomenology is more accurate) known as paṭiccasamuppāda (dependent-origination/dependent-coarising/causal-conditioning). This phenomenology is a way to understand more deeply how dukkha can arise, and understanding the causes for it's arising, we can understand the way out. Kamma, which is basically the law of cause and effect, is a related concept. In terms of causes, Buddhism is concerned primarily with agent-caused action (morality, meditation, and wisdom). All conditioned things depend on multiple causes and conditions (back to paṭiccasamuppāda). So dependent co-arising and kamma are some of the concepts underpinning the idea that we can do actions that put an end to dukkha, instead of perpetuate it (back to the pragmatic emphasis over metaphysical speculation)  Then, at a more ultimate level, are the Buddha's 3 Characteristics of Existence:   1) All conditioned things/phenomena are impermanent.  2) All conditioned things/phenomena are dukkha.  3) All conditioned (and unconditioned) phenomena are non-self/insubstantial.  Nibbana is simply the uprooting of the causes of dukkha from the mind, it is also known as the unconditioned. The non-self characteristic of existence (that applies not only to all conditioned things, but also to the unconditioned) could be understood to be the highest truth in Buddhism. This selflessness is the focus of Nagarjuna's philosophy from my understanding, it is often translated as emptiness and sometimes zero. It is an anti-essentialist position, nothing exists independently of anything else, no Platonic forms, no permanent souls. Again, it is important to note that it is a middle way, and not the extreme of nihilism as it could be misunderstood at face value when we say no-self. Instead it is that the self we conventionally refer to in everyday speech doesn't really exist so independently as we habitually think.  Anyway, Nagarjuna is considered by many (Mahayana Buddhists) to be second in importance to the Buddha.  He uses dependent co-arising, the middle way, and non-self in his exploration of emptiness. He uses a specific logical tool dubbed the tetralemma to dispel what he considers false views, it could be formulated as follows:   All things/phenomena (dharmas):   exist ... (affirmation of being, negation of non-being)  do not exist ... (affirmation of non-being, negation of being)  both exist and do not exist ... (both affirmation and negation)  neither exist nor do not exis ... (neither affirmation nor negation)  [from the wiki page on nagarjuna https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna] edit: formatting"

Which is to say that if you're not willing to create the resource yourself, or at least offer the creator more clear and constructive criticism (beyond ""come up with something a little more unique""), then you ought to be grateful that the resource exists.  It would be a different story if CGP Grey (or some other popular YouTuber) had already produced a video on the liar paradox and presented essentially the same information in the same style.

We can look over at the dog in question and make the logical validation that the point of the statement is true, or false.

While saying so about the paradoxical liar's statement would be true, applying it to itself causes problems.  If it isn't true that the sentence is a string of nonsense, then the content of the sentence becomes untrue, but if the content is therefore cogent, it must be nonsense, making the statement paradoxical. Except not really. Language is nonsense at its core. It's the likening of unlike things.

philosophy,3ct0ax,lapse_of_taste,3,Fri Jul 10 18:14:09 2015 UTC,"I don't think ""I'm only stringing nonsense together within this sentence."" is really all that paradoxical.  The sentence doesn't actually reference itself, it references the action you are taking.    Both your actions and the statement can be true.  They aren't mutually exclusive.  You can sputter out a bunch of nonsense that results in a sentence that makes perfect sense.  Actually, now that I think of it, we need to bring in one more piece of information.  Does the speaker actually understand the words they are speaking?  If the speaker doesn't understand what they are saying, then what I've previously said still remains true.  Both the speakers actions and the sentence are true.  If the speaker DOES understand what they are saying, then both the speakers actions and the sentence are false.  So, whichever you assume to be true, whether the speaker knows what they are saying or not, both the sentence and the speaker's actions will match up.  Either both will be true, or both will be false.  There is no paradox.  It's kind of similar to the whole 'if you had an infinite number of monkeys typing on an infinite amount of typewriters for an infinite amount of time, eventually one of the monkeys would correctly reproduce the complete works of Shakespeare' thing.

After each one, the author says ""The reason why this person/group was denounced is that they did something to help with a problem, but didn't do as much as they could."" I don't see why we should accept that characterization.  Take the Homebase case. By the article's own characterization, the program was already denying people due to a shortage of funding. It was already doing less good than could be done. That wasn't a controversy. What changed? Well, they turned it into an experiment, and people found that objectionable. Probably an unsound objection, but the controversy was about the experiment, not the mere fact that not everyone was being served.  The WiFi hotspot thing seems primarily to have been condemned as dehumanizing. I didn't see any critic say ""The problem is that they weren't paying as much as they could have.""  Article: ""Uber has been repeatedly lambasted for doing something instead of leaving the even-worse status quo the way it was."" Has anyone actually seen this leveled as a criticism of Uber? Here's a criticism that I actually have seen. Notice how far the analysis there is from what the ""Copenhagen Interpretation"" article says is going on in these criticisms.  Click through the link to the article about Evan Thornley. His presentation contained a slide that said ""Women: Like men, only cheaper"" and apparently treated discrimination more as a market inefficiency than as an issue of justice. Who said anything about ""only making it a little bit better""?  Apart from the problems with the positive examples, the abundance of negative examples makes me really skeptical about the thesis. People help in sub-optimal ways all the time. This is rarely controversial. The natural conclusion is that, when things like happen, it's something besides this everyday sub-optimality that has people upset."

My layman conjecture is that we see more virtue-centric thinking in the public sphere than in more private circles, and more when we have an emotional reaction to policies but aren't directly involved in crafting them.  It seems like virtues might function in our current social space as heuristics that guide our ethical thinking when we don't have some more specific framework to apply to a particular situation.

I am not sure that I agree with Hume the causation equates to constant correlation; from the fact must come the idea. Also I am not sure that constant correlation is necessary to develop a notion of causation; anomalous events may be discounted.  Nevertheless, Hume is right that causation is a notion that arises from experience, and the particular kind of experience from which it arises is an apparently regular dependence of observations of some class upon observations of some other class.  Therefore causation presupposes at least two different classes of experience, each of which is observed with some nontrivial degree of frequency. Therefore further, no notion of causation can be developed with respect to the set of all observations, separate from which, no other class of observation exists.  Therefore finally, it is mere ridding to ask what causes the totality of all observation."

The only example you provide is that something like bigotry might be innate, but bigotry clearly has 'demonstrably bad outcomes' so we have good reason to legally discriminate against bigots, even if it were found to be innate and immutable.  Your argument seems to say that gay marriage should be impermissible as long as the community deems it so, which is something people have been fighting against for a long time.   Moreover, you're confusing arguments for moral permissibility and moral responsibility. Compatibilist arguments determine when an agent is morally responsible for some action, and say nothing about whether it is permissible, so really, that whole section is kind of misguided."

So I see what you're saying, I guess I should have clarified that my critique of S3 is not a proper attack against its soundness, but rather an argument against its applicability to (S) as a whole.  You're obviously right in the sense that the Kennedy decision could only happen after Lawrence v. Texas invalidated what was effectively an argument from moral reaction (sodomy is icky, therefore it should be illegal). But if arguments from moral reaction are invalid, on what grounds could SCOUTS rule for gay marriage but against polygamy? It seems to me that the popularity of marriage equality really might explain the difference between the legal status of polygamy and that of gay marriage. How would you distinguish them?  Yes, I'm aware that arguments about free will are concerned with moral responsibility. However, this is what is attractive about the Strawsonian approach: it reminds us that ideas of moral responsibility are informed by morally reactive attitudes, that is, attitudes that are inextricably linked to notions of moral permissibility. In context, I think it makes sense to discuss them together: what I'm saying is that the marriage equality arguments stemming from responsibility miss the point, the debate must actually settle at the level of moral permissibility."

I'm not going to touch on Nietzsche's views on compassion (which are very nuanced and probably can't be treated fully in a comment) but I'd quarrel somewhat with the author's assessment of Nietzsche as opposing ""truth seeking.""  Nietzsche's view on truth can be summarized by the quote, ""I want once and for all not to know too many things, wisdom requires moderation in knowledge as well as other things.""  It's not that Nietzsche is opposed to the idea of truth... It's that he thinks we don't necessarily need unlimited amounts of it.   The simplest illustration of this principle could be expressed in a question:  ""If I don't follow baseball, does it make sense for me to pursue encyclopedic knowledge about MLB batting averages in the 20th century?""  Possessing such knowledge surely increases the number of ""truths"" in our brain, but is it helpful? Relevant?   If you pay close attention, you'll see that Nietzsche's alleged opposition to ""truth seeking"" is itself in service of ""truth"" or ""knowledge"" of a type--specifically, the truths that are helpful to us. There is not really much point in storing up warehouses of encyclopedic knowledge if you don't get some real meaning out of it, and I think that's precisely the attitude Nietzsche took against allegedly ""impartial"" truth-seeking.  The other dimension to Nietzsche's allegedly ""anti-truth"" stance is his perspectivism, as best outlined in the essay ""On Truth And Lie In Non-Moral Sense"". Here Nietzsche develops two arguments that might lead a naive reader to think he is ""anti-truth"":   That words (in the context of statements) refer to other words and not (directly) to an external reality.  That words (considered individually) are at best a second hand derivation from outside reality; the ""outside"" object is converted into a sensory image in the brain, the sensory image is signposted with a word.   From these two premises Nietzsche derives the conclusion that statements--outside of tautologies--are never really true or false in the way we think of it. But here he is referring merely to truth in one sense of the term: statement-world correspondence. His theory still leaves open the possibility for ""value"" theories of truth, and Nietzsche himself suggested once that ""objectivity"" is attained by considering and weighing multiple perspectives."
philosophy,3ctnek,MisterButtunz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"Hi, I'm the author of the linked post.   You probably have more knowledge of Nietzsche than I am, so please bear with me. :) I actually agree with all the points you make in your comment. I'm just not sure if your interpretation of Nietzsche really matched his actual views, but if so, all power to him! :)  My comments on Nietzsche basically were caused by re-reading ""The Gay Science"" and it really does seem like as if he is not too keen on truth, at least in this book.   Here for example a longer quote:   ""This unconditional will to truth—what is it? Is it the will not to allow oneself to be deceived? Or is it the will not to deceive? For the will to truth could be interpreted in the second way, too—if only the special case ""I do not want to deceive myself"" is subsumed under the generalization ""I do not want to deceive."" But why not deceive? But why not allow oneself to be deceived?  Note that the reasons for the former principle belong to an altogether different realm from those for the second. One does not want to allow oneself to be deceived because one assumes it is harmful, dangerous, calamitous to be deceived. In this sense, science would be a long-range prudence, a caution, a utility; but one could object in al fairness: How is that? Is wanting not to allow oneself to be deceived really less harmful, less dangerous, less calamitous? What do you know in advance of the character of existence to be able to decide whether the greater advantage is on the side of the unconditional mistrust or of the unconditionally trusting? But if both should be required, much trust as well as much mistrust, from where would science then be permitted to take its unconditional faith or conviction on which it rests, that truth is more important than any other thing, including every other conviction? Precisely this conviction could never have come into being if both truth and untruth constantly proved to be useful which is the case. Thus—the faith in science, which after all exists undeniably, cannot owe its origin to such a calculus of utility; it must have originated in spite of the fact that the disutility and dangerousness of ""the will to truth,"" of ""truth at any price"" is proved to it constantly. ""At any price ': how well we understand these words once we have offered and slaughtered one faith after another on this altar!  Consequently, ""will to truth"" does not mean ""I will not allow [282] myself to be deceived"" but—there is no alternative—""I will not deceive, not even myself""; and with that we stand on moral ground. For you only have to ask yourself carefully, ""Why do you not want to deceive?"" especially if it should seem—and it does seem!—as if life aimed at semblance, meaning error, deception, simulation, delusion, self-delusion, and when the great sweep of life has actually always shown itself to be on the side of the most unscrupulous polytropoi[refers to Homer's characterization of Odysseus: much travelled, versatile, wily, and manifold]. Charitably interpreted, such a resolve might perhaps be a quixotism,[referring to Don Quixote] a minor slightly mad enthusiasm; but it might also be something more serious, namely, a principle that is hostile to life and destructive.—""Will to truth""—that might be a concealed will to death."""
philosophy,3ct3nb,wiphiadmin,2,Fri Jul 10 15:36:53 2015 UTC,"While The Tragedy of the Commons is often cited as an issue of ownership, this is not the case. 'Ownership' is such a complicated issue that definitions are required whenever it comes up. No meaningful system of ownership is going to be without inherent conflict and complicated systems for managing this conflict.  This video goes even further to implicate 'common ownership', which is a concept that is even more nuanced and in need of definition.  The example from which the name comes from is British common grazing lands. In the 19th century, the commons were privately allocated, inciting protest from the users of the commons. The Tragedy of the Commons was a story used to justify this privatization, claiming that the commons were under threat of destruction due to 'natural' economic forces. The only problem is that the vast majority of the commons in the UK were quite productive and had been for centuries. Users of the commons were deterred from misuse by a system of both formal and informal norms. In at least its originating case, 'common ownership' was reasonably successful.  The issue with the Tragedy of the Commons has little to do with 'ownership' and everything to do with externalities. When an entity does not realize the full cost of its activities, there is economic incentive to profit at the expense of others. This happens regardless of ownership and can even occur as a result of ownership; as an example, privatization of land often results in uncoordinated clearing of forest which reduces wildlife habitat and damages watersheds."

When we see the distant masses suffering, however, something prevents us from drawing them into the center of our concern.   I feel as though the author is stepping cautiously around a sort of pure selfishness in people here, wherein to see only one person suffer, we take it as if a threat against our own selves, and we weep for ourselves, but if we are to see many, that then becomes something soothing, as if we would climb up from hell on the backs of others, as if in the many we find something to wish the ills of the world upon in order to spare ourselves.   In addition to the globalization of indifference, there is also the globalization of hopelessness. Even in cases where we do have appropriate concern for the plight of others across the globe, we feel that we’re powerless to help them.   I don't know. Something interesting, though, for the existentialist thinker.   Of course not that that pure selfishness need necessarily be something vile of the person, either.

philosophy,3co48b,Ihatecheese86,2,Thu Jul 9 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"I haven't read Heidegger at all, so please correct me here, but I found this part to be confusing.  Truth illuminates and conceals, but unless what has been illuminated is changing, everything is a matter of memory.  The illuminated aspects of truth could be 'remembered' in some sophisticated way that renders the need for light superfluous.  I might be taking this all a bit too literally, but it is interesting."
philosophy,3co48b,TranscendentalObject,17,Thu Jul 9 20:41:43 2015 UTC,"If you haven't read Heidegger's Question Concerning Technology you should, as it deals explicitly with the idea of aletheia and the whole unconcealed/concealing stuff. In the essay Heidegger talks about how the world can be culturally disclosed (or enframed) based on the temporal epoch one finds themselves in. He says that we are currently living in a technological epoch that has basically turned nature and everything else into a means to an end (the woods are no longer the resting place of trees but a potential lumber mill, a river is no longer just a river but a future site to extract hydroelectricity, etc). None of this is revolutionary thinking at all, but what is somewhat revolutionary is the notion that this is just one instance of world disclosure out of a multitude of different ones. So, to use the OP's light example, our current technological world is what is currently being illuminated by man, to the detriment of other potential types of world. When we shine the light and reveal our current world (unconcealment) the only way we can do so is by shrouding other potential worlds (concealment). This is due to how the world works for us as a culturally disclosive force. He thinks the greeks lived in a completely different world than the one that we currently live in, that they had an entirely different relationship to nature than we currently do, and he believes this is the result of our being exposed to a different world altogether, one that is enframed differently.  Our technological world, then, is not something permanent or everlasting. Rather, it is something malleable. This is when it gets very hard to deny Heidegger's existentialist leanings because if the world is malleable based on how it is enframed, it is malleable because of us. If we can alter the world so drastically, then suddenly man holds an incredible power in his hands - the power to shine the light on an entirely different way of life for not just himself, but culture as a whole."
philosophy,3co48b,pearedge,2,Thu Jul 9 21:44:38 2015 UTC,Thank you for the additional help! Do you know any works by Heidegger that details the process of the malleability?
philosophy,3co48b,TranscendentalObject,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:35:13 2015 UTC,"First give 'Origin of the work of Art' a read. It's all about how world works in relation to artworks which is fairly illuminating with respect to how world first crops up to begin with. After that give his essay ""Building, Dwelling, Thinking"" a shot. It's late-Heidegger so it's very 'out there' but his writing on the four fold is pretty fascinating for seeing world's place in his mature thought. You can always tackle Being and Time for insight, though I think what you're after will be found mostly in his essays post-B&T."
philosophy,3co48b,davidjoho,2,Fri Jul 10 01:47:44 2015 UTC,"I was with you right until the end. Great comment, though. Thank you.  You point to Heidegger's ""existentialist leanings,"" but in my reading, this is exactly where he differs from existentialism. Heidegger believes (or so I read him) that we cannot escape our historical situation. I understand the world around me as I do because I was born in the middle of the 20th century in America. When you get down to the level of how things are, this means I have ideas about what it means to be real, how much I can control my future, what ""natural"" means and how it relates to what we care about, what it means to share a world with others, etc. These beliefs are not just beliefs: they are how the world is disclosed to me. They are how the world goes together in the first place. They are my sense of what matters. They are not what I see so much as what enables me to see at all.  And they are (in my reading) not all that malleable. We can't simply choose to disclose the world differently, especially at this foundational level. Disclosure isn't a flashlight so much as light itself.   You are certainly right (= I agree with you :) that the nature of disclosure changes over the course of time, according to Heidegger. But that doesn't mean it's something we can change. That's why H spends so much of his life writing about the ""history of Being,"" which for the West began with its most truthful disclosure in ancient Greece, as you know from the references to ""physis"" in The Question Concerning Technology. For H, these changes in disclosure are actually changes in Being. They occur at the pace of history. They are what enable disclosure at all, and are not something individuals can simply choose change. (Existentialists, on the other hand, are all about radically free choice, yadda yadda.)  In short, I really like your comments, but I think you have given short shrift to Heidegger's  lifelong commitment to exploring Being.   Thank you again for such a thoughtful and clear explanation.  (On a completely different point, I find H's Technology essay to be insightful about the Information Age, but not terribly helpful about the Networked Age. Anyway.)"
philosophy,3co48b,TranscendentalObject,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:33:19 2015 UTC,"You are quite correct! However, I wonder why Heidegger would warn of 'the danger' of modern technology if we were deterministically bound to living in it according to its own dictate. Does the nature of a warning not imply that we should steer ourselves freely in light of such a finding, to obtain the safest route? I wonder what the point is of outlining the danger of modern technology if we are powerless to stop it? Sure, world-disclosure does happen at the level of history, but history is comprised of individual action. I don't think we can strip our autonomy, nor our capacity to create big change in ourselves and the world around us simply because we are historical creatures, but you are importantly correct in saying that our history will determine us in various crucial ways (including the very context of what and how we will be able to respond to our current situation!) However, I think there has to be some wiggle-room in our historical indebtedness as I don't think Heidegger is the type of philosopher to subscribe to a hard-determinism, especially in light of his observations on anxiety, freedom and authenticity (i'm aware that these are sort of 'younger' thoughts in Heidegger's corpus, but they are still concepts that are very alive throughout Heidegger's work, beginning to end). I liked your response alot, you seem to have a compassionate eye for this stuff, which is very cool to see."
philosophy,3co48b,davidjoho,2,Fri Jul 10 15:06:00 2015 UTC,"Wow, is that on point!   I'll tell you what I think Heidegger's response would be, but I should also say that I think it's wrong and dangerously wrong.  I think H would say that not all disclosures of Being are equally true. Of course, H has difficulty using the word ""true"" because it has taken on a metaphysical meaning he rejects. So, H talks in terms of our forgetting our origins. The original disclosure to the Greeks was the clear-est, which is why H repeatedly goes back to Greek ideas, as per ""physis"" (or ""phusis"") in the technology essay. H sees his task as one of remembering the origin, but doing so in a way that does not simply repeat it. I think this is what he sometimes means by das Ereignis (""the happening of Being,"" the event of Being""...it seems to be impossible to translate, possibly because it doesn't actually mean anything -- H pisses me off frequently, if that's not obvious).   In any case, H seems to have a concept of a true-er way of understanding the world at the level of Being. So, H can say that the technologized way of being in the world (the Enframing) forgets the truth of physis just as he can argue that Descartes' metaphysics forgets the essential unity of self and world. We now experience ourselves as separate from the ""external"" world, thanks to Descartes. BUT, I read Being and Time as saying that if we look at how we actually experience the world (or are in the world) free of our metaphysical, rationalistic assumptions, we can see that original unity; we only experience the world as apart from us when a tool breaks, or when we sit in a corner and get all philosophical. So, in a sense we live in the truth, but we think in error.  But that's B&T. By the time we get to the Technology essay, it seems as if we live in error and think in error. That is, we experience the world as a mere resource for our uses. The way out of that error, for H, seems not to be a phenomenological examination of our experience so much as a reliance on the ability of great poets and great Thinkers (like Heidegger, pat pat)  to disclose the truth to us.   I'm not sure I'm getting this last part right. I totally agree with you that in the Technology article he's not just describing the modern view. He is denouncing it. But I don't accept the origins myth about the Greek beginning, so I'm left flapping in the wind. Worse, H himself was a superb example of how dangerous is the belief that Being imposes a destiny upon us. Heil Sein, if you know what I mean.   BTW, from his last interview: ""Only a god can save us now."""
philosophy,3co48b,TranscendentalObject,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:31:52 2015 UTC,"I don't really have anything to add to your illuminating response, but I just want to say thanks for helping me clarify some things. Heidegger post-B&T is such a confusing/fascinating/aggravating/horrifying animal, and it's always great to talk about it with people! Any guesses as to what's going on in Heidegger's theology? I just read the Spiegal interview and his claim that we need to ""make ready for the readiness of holding ourselves open for the arrival or absence of god"" is confusing me to high hell. No worries if you're unsure."
philosophy,3co48b,davidjoho,2,Fri Jul 10 23:14:16 2015 UTC,"Oy!   That's for the question. But thanks for the comment.   The easy part is that Heidegger is as clear as he ever is that Western philosophy has forgotten Being and for a looong stretch replaced it with God (onto-theology). Traditional God has no place in H's ontology.  But then, after Being and Time, he starts talking about the gods -- part of his ""remembering"" of the Greek tradition. But these gods are not much like the Christian God. Instead, as  part of the Fourfold, they seem to be something like (and here I am officially over my head) the presence of absence (i.e., we're aware of them as being not here) and the graciousness of Being (i.e., that there is anything at all is an inexplicable gift).   The truth is that once H gets to the Fourfold, I'm thinking: He's just making stuff up now. As far as I can tell, it could have just as well been the threefold or the ninefold. It's not bad poetry, though.   I like that the Fourfold refers to actual, existing things: earth, sky, mortals, and gods. Three out of four ain't bad! What makes a thing into the thing that it is? What makes a pitcher into a pitcher and a cigar into a cigar? Look at how it ""gathers"" -- makes manifest -- the foursome. A pitcher is made of earth and contains juice made from plants growing on the earth. Those plants grow under the sky. It's made by and for mortals who need the sustenance in the pitcher. We mortals pour out a libation to remember the gods who are present in their absence. (Well, we pour out a libation if we're ancient Greeks.)   Compare that to, say, your iPad. The foursome are not nearly as obvious in it.  But, as I say, it seems like a pretty arbitrary selection of elements to elevate."

As far as I can tell, it could have just as well been the threefold or the ninefold. It's not bad poetry, though.   Ah, that is so refreshing to hear. I've read building, dwelling, thinking a few times now and it really does feel like some of the craziest and arbitrary stuff he ever wrote (the true crown goes to his contributions though i'm afraid). I like your point about the ipad... you have to do some fancy footwork to cram certain items within the fourfold... Not so much with more 'natural' items in nature, but if the fourfold is meant to be gathered at all it has to be gathered by everything. I once heard of later Heidegger being compared to making sense of a rorschach image. That's not too terribly uncharitable don't think.    The easy part is that Heidegger is as clear as he ever is that Western philosophy has forgotten Being and for a looong stretch replaced it with God (onto-theology). Traditional God has no place in H's ontology.   If it's not asking too much, could you maybe expand a bit on this? I don't know anything about heidegger's onto-theology and i'm eager to learn. Maybe you could point me towards an article, or maybe one of his essays or something? No worries if you want to take a pass, this has already been quite a worthwhile discussion! Thanks."
philosophy,3co48b,davidjoho,2,Sun Jul 12 14:55:03 2015 UTC,"I haven't kept up with the Heidegger literature since I left academic philosophy in 1986, although for the past 5 yrs or so I've been lurking on the Heidegger Circle mailing list, which is fascinating for multiple reasons, not least because watching serious Heidegger scholars is a really interesting anthropological pursuit. Needless to say, that's a side interest; the mailing list often talks about quite substantial issues.  Anyway, H talks about ontotheology in Being and Time and also in Identity and Difference. Elsewhere too, but it's been too long. The way I understand his beef, at least in BT, is that the Western tradition has treated God as the ground of Being: God is the Creator, God is the First Mover, God is the guarantor of the reliability of our thought, all truth must lead back to God. But that grounds Being in something outside of Being. In fact, the very structure of that idea stipulates a metaphysics that H rejects: there is the perceived world and then the unperceived ground that makes it possible. Suppose instead we start not with a supposition about how things ""must"" be, but with our experience of the world. In that case, we find a unity of experience and world, which Aristotle calls a ""precedent community."" This is the always-already that H talks about so much in B&T. And it is for me H's fundamental and transformative insight.  But I'm an unreliable guide . The two external examiners of my doctoral dissertation on Heidegger's ontology of Das Ding both said the dissertation was fine but that I seem never to talk about Being in it. I feel about Being the way H seems to feel about God: You could just not talk about it and make great headway. But clearly this puts me way outside the Heideggerian mainstream."

philosophy,3co48b,Blindweb,7,Thu Jul 9 20:36:01 2015 UTC,"This is straight up Taoism and Zen.  A couple months ago on this subeditor I mentioned Taoism and people said they couldn't get into it.   If you understand Heidegger you're most of the way there.  Dasein: The Tao  Living authentically: Wu Wei Wu (To do without doing)   Language obscures reality:    Colors blind the eye. Sounds deafen the ear. Flavors numb the taste. Thoughts weaken the mind. Desires wither the heart.  The Master observes the world but trusts his inner vision. He allows things to come and go. His heart is open as the sky.   Care - Basic starting point of Taosim.  Accepting reality and your reactions to it as it is   Obeying the they - touched on many places in the Tao Te Ching on proper governance and power structures.   Interestingly I've heard Alan Watts (Zen writer who came after Heidegger) use almost the exact same flashlight analogy, talk about the planet being destroyed because people have lost touch with actual reality, and the ideas of foreground vs background.  When it gets to 11 minutes about 'doing it now' it's clear Alan Watts borrowed from Heidegger"
philosophy,3co48b,Pinkhouses,2,Thu Jul 9 23:57:06 2015 UTC,"For me, the difference between Heidegger and Zen is the difference between technology and dependent origination. Where Heidegger's technology is what gives unity to any particular iteration of causality, dependent origination in Dogen is of a somewhat higher order because of the notion of the eternal.   For instance, the question posed in the Fukazazengi is this: if the way is perfectly penetrating, why must you assume cultivation and verification? If what we are talking about is so pervasive as to encompass the eternal unfolding of causality, why do I even need to study it? And yet, even despite it's penetration, a single misstep leaves farther away from it than the stars from the earth.   The only way to explain this counterintuitive difference, which is constituted precisely in it's nearness, is to accept both principles simultaneously, to say that difference  is nearness and nearness is difference. This is very different from Heidegger, where ""technology"" is that iterative unity from which nearness becomes difference--Dogen's causality is eternal, Heidegger's bound to time."

Sure, I was more ""successful"" in the sense that I advanced more quickly through the game. But I also found that by playing that way, I had a diminished sense of adventure, wonder, and freedom.

Although I agreed with you at first, /u/Zeydon did make me wonder if this was correct (not saying he's correct; just that it got me out of my instant zombie ""I agree"" mode and made me pause to consider), and I don't feel like it is. Playing through a game with a walkthrough is less fun, and you diminish how much wonder and adventure you gain from it (I had the some experience when I started looking up recipies for Minecraft), but this doesn't seem to be a good analogy, if only because the game still leads you through levels and has a goal to it. By contrast, life is different; it's as though you were in Dark Souls but then could choose to try playing any level in the game, or even more, if all the barriers and walls in the game were knocked down. I can go down one path in life as a carpenter, or a completely different direction as a botanist, and still different if I become a mathematician. The point is, any of these would be ""correct"", and none of them ""wrong,"" whereas in a video game, if you try running in a direction where a wall exists, then it is clearly wrong; there are objectively ""correct"" directions to go. Actually, rereading this, I think Minecraft might be a better analogy, if only because you can go in literally any direction you want, and no one can tell you ""that's wrong."" In this case, living authentically might be travelling into the middle of nowhere (as an aside, in Minecraft, everywhere is the middle of nowhere) even if everyone else on the server starts criticizing you for going somewhere that is pointless, simply because it's what you want for yourself.  ...Does that sound correct?

You can't change these things, but they change and shape you into a you that is socially biased (not necessarily politically, but views are a huge part of it). We are born into one society over another, and that directly influences us.

The authentic self, which is likely an impossible goal due to social constructs, would be able to live for the future based solely on a state of knowing their own mortality; our mortality would liberate us, rather than confine us, as death is the only thing that can truly be yours and your own (marriage, birth, graduation, all experiences that are shared with others. Death is truly our own)"
philosophy,3co48b,kescusay,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:58:50 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with how you describe facticity in your second paragraph. Nicely put. But I think Heidegger does not think you can escape facticity. In fact, that's the point of facticity. You're thrown into it and you can't ever not have been thrown into it. Authenticity means embracing that fact, not escaping it, at least in my understanding of Being and Time.  For example, an inauthentic person denies death. Of course we all understand we're going to die. But an inauthentic person tries to avoid facing this truth and making it her/his own. For such a person, death is always something that happens to someone else. We distract ourselves from our mortality by watching superhero movies, or filling our minds with trivialities at BuzzFeed or even sometimes Reddit. Etc. etc. (I'm speaking for Heidegger here, not me!)   An authentic person, on the other hand, embraces her/his mortality, being at risk at every instant, our insignificance in the universe, the fact that we are always tempted to escape from the truths of our lives, the inescapable facticity of the situation into which we have found ourselves thrown.   That's how I take the ol' Nazi bastard, anyway."
philosophy,3co48b,tigerbait92,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:57:09 2015 UTC,"This is something I just don't get. How can death be said to be truly our own? We don't even experience all facets of our deaths. We don't experience cell death, as the different parts of our bodies shut down. We don't experience the impacts our deaths have on other people. Arguably, we don't even experience all elements of brain death, because once part of a brain dies it can no longer experience anything.  For those reasons among others, Heidegger's ""authentic self"" is very objectionable. It doesn't stand up to even moderate scrutiny. Perhaps it is still a good idea to pursue a life that is as free of artificial constraints as possible, but I can do without Heidegger's baggage."
philosophy,3co48b,kescusay,3,Thu Jul 9 16:32:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I understand his point of view, but I don't really agree with it completely. Simply because it's fundamentally impossible to achieve the 'authentic self', unless born in a test tube (and even then, that's a stretch).   Don't get me wrong, I'm all for finding my authentic self, but I don't think it's something that can be fully realized, especially when there's a semiotic system of global capitalism in the world. Simply put, our need to survive (via economical means) will at some point outweigh our ability to be authentic; transcendence is an impossible feat for an organism invested in social structures.  Ad for the death thing, it's not so much as the experience of death as it is death conceptually. When you die, you're the only one dying your death. Others might feel grief, but they aren't following you into the afterlife/grave, unlike birth where you've been existing for 9 months, then will be subjected to dasMan. In death, you are free from dasMan, thus, it is the sole 'authentic' experience that we can have. The best we can do is live trying to have Dasein, but even then, we are 'averaged' out by those around us. Only in death (conceptually), is there true Dasein."
philosophy,3co48b,Zeydon,2,Thu Jul 9 17:18:55 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's a worthy pursuit - at least from my perspective. But at the same time, I don't think it's even necessarily a worthy pursuit for all people, all the time. For some, the most authentic expression of self is only possible in social situations. They're most realized and most actualized when interacting with others.  Another thought occurs regarding death... We are colonies, not individuals. My body is about 50% other life forms by mass. My brain is a collection of systems that often disagree with each other and argue their way to a consensus. When I say ""I die,"" the I encompasses a lot of different things that each, independently, may die without killing me. So is it even true to say that when I die as a whole, it's only me who is having my death?"

philosophy,3co48b,irlgayfag,2,Thu Jul 9 18:04:10 2015 UTC,"I'd see it the opposite way.  They might be by themselves, but they often deal with both the order (police) and chaos (themselves) of society.  They might not seem like it, but they are forced to be very aware of the world (weather, people, etc) to survive.  So they know the common ""system"" in and out if they want to not be in prison.  Plus, there are often communities of them, and they have to often take a survival of the fittest attitude to make it through a rough patch; they learn how to be at the top of their established system.  Also, they might have constructed their own system (with different ethics, beliefs, etc) to survive, that doesn't mesh with our system, but is still a system nonetheless.  I'd say the middle class have the best chance at being authentic.  Though with more family lifestyle, and always being subject to the higher class (via ads, magazines, etc), they have enough education options to learn (knowledge being a key ingredient of enlightenment), as well as the least subjected class (poor are at the mercy of rich and govt, rich are racing each other to the top, and as such compete within themselves and seem to base their decisions on the opposite of the poor).  I don't know, I'm kinda thinking this up on the spot, you raised a pretty good question that I am not clicking with, I'm feeling the opposite."
philosophy,3co48b,kescusay,2,Thu Jul 9 18:16:57 2015 UTC,"For those reasons among others, Heidegger's ""authentic self"" is very objectionable. It doesn't stand up to even moderate scrutiny.   That is an unsustainable claim to make and I think you should tone it down. Heidegger's thought would not have continued for so long had it not been able to stand up to moderate scrutiny. Heidegger, in fact, specifically addresses your objections.   Therefore, an understanding of Dasein's relation to death would make an essential contribution to our understanding of Dasein as a whole. But now a problem immediately presents itself: since one cannot experience one's own death, it seems that the kind of phenomenological analysis that has hitherto driven the argument of Being and Time breaks down, right at the crucial moment. One possible response to this worry, canvassed explicitly by Heidegger, is to suggest that Dasein understands death through experiencing the death of others. However, the sense in which we experience the death of others falls short of what is needed. We mourn departed others and miss their presence in the world. But that is to experience Being-with them as dead, which is a mode of our continued existence.... So another response is called for. Heidegger's move is to suggest that although Dasein cannot experience its own death as actual, it can relate towards its own death as a possibility that is always before it—always before it in the sense that Dasein's own death is inevitable. Peculiarly among Dasein's possibilities, the possibility of Dasein's own death must remain only a possibility, since once it becomes actual, Dasein is no longer. Death is thus the “possibility of the impossibility of any existence at all” (Being and Time 53: 307). And it is this awareness of death as an omnipresent possibility that cannot become actual that stops the phenomenological analysis from breaking down. The detail here is crucial.

Heidegger's thought would not have continued for so long had it not been able to stand up to moderate scrutiny.   Hold on, I'm not attacking all of ""Heidegger's thought."" I'm only pointing out flaws in the concept of an ""authentic self,"" and I'm certainly neither the first nor the last to do so. Heidegger's influence in philosophy is absolutely unquestionable, but to argue that his work is meritorious - or at least ought not be subjected to harsh criticism - on the basis of its longevity is a poor argument. Heidegger stands or falls on his merits, not on how long others have been kind to him.  Regarding my specific objection, I really don't see that he addresses it. My objection is not to the idea that others can't experience our deaths, it is to the characterization of our deaths as singular, belonging only to us, when we know that what we call a person's death is actually many things dying, not even all at the same time. Physically speaking, as I wrote elsewhere, we are colonies, the components of which can - and do - die their own deaths without killing the whole colony. How can I logically claim my death is my ""ownmost"" when it is actually made up of so many deaths I cannot directly experience at all?  I don't want to be all down on Heidegger, but honestly, I can see why the analytics have such a low view of him. He clearly gave this a lot of thought, but I question the rigor of that thought. He famously eschewed clarity, saying ""making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy."" I think it is only career suicide for those philosophers whose careers rely on difficult verbosity."

philosophy,3co48b,kescusay,2,Thu Jul 9 22:14:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what Heidegger means by your death being your own. One aspect of being alive is that there is a vast range of possibilities available to you, ranging from how to perceive an ""object"" to what kind of life you want to live. One inevitability is that ultimately you will no longer experience being of any kind though. This is the importance of death - it's not the act of dying, which you don't really experience, or the aftermath, which you are not alive to experience. It's the possibility of no longer experiencing possibilities. To contemplate your own death is really to contemplate your own non-being, this is tricky to imagine without resorting to some kind of false, third person ""objective"" perspective.   The possibility of your own non-bring is something that only you can experience and understand, it doesn't mean anything to me, it's not some abstract concept. To understand your own inevitable death is NOT the same as understanding someone else dying. It is yours, and yours alone, and this own-ness is one of the reasons Heidegger relates it to authenticity (eigentlich, which gets translated as authenticity, is a play on words in German, it literally means own-ness).  I think you misunderstand what he means by authentic self too, but that's another post."

philosophy,3co48b,ralphiello,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:18:06 2015 UTC,"It's not a concept he pursues outside of his first big book, ""Being and Time."" Possibly because it doesn't hold up to scrutiny.  He is very explicit that he's not using authenticity and inauthenticity in moral terms— he's just describing two ways of being. My understanding is that to be authentic means to recognize, accept, and embrace the limitations inherent in being human: We are mortal, we can't escape the basic situation into which we've been historically thrown (e.g., 21st century American, speaking English, etc....or whatever), and the rest of what Being and Time describes as what it means to be human.  For Heidegger, by the end of Being and Time, being authentic gets wrapped up in resolutely embracing one's historical destiny, a destiny not shared with those who are ""rootless"" (which scholars have argued was actually a dogwhistle intended to mean ""those fucking Jews what with all their wandering"") and starts to sound like an ontological argument in favor of National Socialism. Authentic Nazis. Just what we need. Sigh.  (Feel free to ignore the previous paragraph if it irks you. It's more speculative, and pissed off, than the ones before it.)"

In summary it concerns which simulated individuals we can count when calculating the fraction of simulated/real people. We cannot count individuals from simulations that we ourselves run, because these simulated individuals don’t contribute to the possibility that we are in a simulated universe. In fact the only ones we can count are those in other universes; only individuals that aren’t from our universe or from universes that we might eventually simulate can be counted.  This is important because it changes the expectation of simulated individuals that Bostrom is trying to calculate. The expected number of simulated people must be multiplied by the prior probability that we place on the existence of a universe other than our own. If this probability is taken to be very small, then the conclusion of the simulation argument doesn’t follow, and we cannot conclude that it is probable that we are living in a computer simulation.

I mean just take ""what we could simulate today"" vs ""what we actually bother to simulate"".  We have lots of photos, maps, letters and stuff and if we actually cared we could put all of those together to make interactive Google Earth MMORPG thingy that collects all the info of the past. But nobody cares. Most of the images are rotting away in some library archive or worse and even something trivial as a high quality 3D scan of some famous piece of art or architecture can be hard to find. Nobody has the time or money needed to put a large scale simulation of the past together.  Or for something even more trivial, take the Internet. History is lost constantly over here. You might get lucky and somebody might have screenshoted something or archive.org might have caught it in time, but there is a whole lot of stuff that just gets lost when a server shuts down for good. People just don't really care that much about the past and are much more interesting in the presence and future.  Another issue that you can't replicate the human behavior of the past, as there is simply not enough data for that. So even if you could simulate 7 billion people, you would just end up simulating random people, not people that behaved the same way people in actual history would behave. So you would just end up playing a giant game of The Sims instead of learning much about what actually happened in the past."

philosophy,3cpc1c,aamir3,4,Thu Jul 9 18:13:06 2015 UTC,"I feel like this article went off the rails at the end a bit.  It used science to lay a foundation and support for determinism then at the end just disregarded any of the scientific reasons for stuff and went to ""God"" and ""Quantum Physics"" without explaining any of the stuff behind that.  The realities are that:   In science we (humans) always assume causality. Everything happens because something made it happen. Quantum Physics throws a wrench into this a bit since quantum particles are weird.   But the author never really explains any of the quantum physics theories that try to account for this sort of behavior, nor does he talk about the fact that the physics rules that govern the very small (quantum) are not the same as the rules that govern the very large (relativistic). (This is where the search for a theory of everything comes from)  So to use the causality argument as a support for determinism then to dismiss determinism because of the quantum is mixing two things that currently don't mix.  I'd also note that some of the modern physics theories that can account for the perceived free will of living creatures are rather fanciful and have no way to be proved at the moment (Multiverse, etc.) but are at least a scientific way to describe the problem and are less fanciful then bringing God into it, as they will at some point be testable."
philosophy,3cpc1c,arcaneadam,3,Thu Jul 9 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"I don't think that quantum mechanics has much to offer. I agree with you that the author seemed to introduce quantum mechanics as if it represents some major paradigm shift in thinking, and in a way it does, but not in the way the author wants. I believe that I can make clear some of the problems with calling upon quantum mechanics.  Firstly, non-determinism and determinism don't look very different in science. Sorting out whether a system is 'truly' random or just chaotic has been a long standing problem in physics. For instance, brownian motion can be characterized by both deterministic and non-deterministic systems. The quantum realm is no different. Pilot-wave theory is a deterministic version of quantum mechanics that makes the same observable predictions. Quantum mechanics is used in practice because of tradition and Ockham's razor. However, Ockham's razor is guided by how well a description compresses information rather than if it is a correct description of the underlying system.  Regardless of which is the ""correct"" interpretation, what matters is that they are interchangeable. Non-deterministic processes gives rise to apparently deterministic behavior. And deterministic processes give rise to apparently non-deterministic behavior. This suggests to me that determinism and non-determinism is largely a human constructed dichotomy.  So aside from the more obvious scaling issue of quantum mechanics into the macro-realm, any argument that could be made on the basis of non-deterministic quantum interactions has a deterministic counterpart.  *Side note: Chaotic systems will exhibit serialization where-as stochastic systems will not. This doesn't impact the equivalence of both in our universe due to the uncertainty principle. We would require infinite resolution and infinite time to resolve the difference between a chaotic and truly stochastic system, since neither of those conditions can be fullfilled for all practical purposes a non-deterministic description will always have a deterministic counterpart, and vice versa."

Having said that Quantum Mechanics was and remains a major paradigm shift in our understanding of nature. It is such a massive paradigm shift that we still have not reconciled to its findings 100 years after its birth. Also while it is true that the Pilot-wave theory tried to propose a determinism compatible interpretation of QM but there are many flaws in the theory. The theory is based on hidden variables theory, which was famously ruled out by experimental confirmation of John Bell’s inequalities theorem. Hidden Variables/Pilot Wave theory also does not explain entanglement well and it also does not scale well to describe a system containing more than a limited number of particles (much less the entire universe). David Bohm who originally came up with the theory always maintained that his theory was not final and that QM needed entirely new concepts and background philosophies to make it work. Bohm’s later focus was on the ‘wholeness’ of the universe (systems, or top down approach) and he also maintained that there two kinds of order, explicate order (what we readily see, deterministic aspects of the universe) and implicate order (what is not directly accessible to us, quantum and below).  ""This suggests to me that determinism and non-determinism is largely a human constructed dichotomy.""  I like this assessment, moreover these may not be the only human constructed dichotomies!"

Bohmian Mechanics was explicitly nonlocal from the outset, so Bell Inequality violations are not a problem. In fact, Bell himself was an admirer of Bohm's approach to QM. It inspired a lot of his thinking.  This is not to suggest that pilot wave approaches are without issues. But they are not the only deterministic options. For example, both MWI and time-symmetric interpretations are fully deterministic."

In his 1980 book “Wholeness and the implicate Order” David Bohm wrote:  “If we supposed that theories gave true knowledge, corresponding to 'reality as it is', then we would have to conclude that Newtonian Mechanics was true until around 1900, after which it suddenly became false, while relativity and quantum theory suddenly became the truth. Such an absurd conclusion does not arise, however, if we say that all theories are insights, which are neither true nor false. ... Man is continually developing new forms of insight, which are clear up to a point and then tend to become unclear. In this activity, there is evidently no reason to suppose that there is or will be a final form of insight (corresponding to absolute truth) or even a steady series of approximations to this. Rather, one may expect the unending development of new forms of insight (which will, however assimilate certain key features of the older forms as simplifications, in the way that relativity theory does with Newtonian theory). Our theories are to be regarded primarily as ways of looking at the world as a whole ('world-views') rather than as 'absolute true knowledge of how things are'.  This is the central premise of my view, which is influenced by Bohm among many others. And also the reason I want to conclude my series (hopefully) with a look at epistemology."

Since most things are learned from experience, I don't think that my asserting that any given species of causation must be one of those things compels me to present a model of learning -- a ridiculous demand, actually. Children are not born with the notion that too much sunlight causes sunburn. We can only acquire this notion from our our own experience and trusted reports of that of others. For another example, at one time, no one knew that exposure to radium causes grave damage to human tissue.  This makes my point that the notion of any given species causation does not arise by assumption (your claim), but from experience.  This, incidentally, shows why is mere riddling to speak of the cause of all things, since we can have no experience whereby the ensemble of all things is regularly correlated with anything else."

philosophy,3cpc1c,Flexography,3,Fri Jul 10 09:47:55 2015 UTC,"I disagree with setting up the issue of free will as one about the existence or non-existence of an immaterial mind.  Even for an immaterial mind, every event could be determined.  Leibniz thought, for example, that the universe could only be one way, because God created the best universe possible.  But Leibniz argued that people had free will even though everything that ever happens happens necessarily given God's existence.  It looks like Descartes, with respect to clear & distinct perceptions, also thought that fully deterministic things can also be free.    The issue isn't whether or not there is an external force acting on the physical world.  The issue is what conditions are required for free will, and do those conditions ever obtain?  I feel like you really mischaracterized the Compatibilism vs Incompatibilism debate.  First, when we say that ""many"" philosophers are Compatibilists, we really mean the majority of contemporary philosophers.  Second, it seems like Compatibilism is probably not motivated by ""our incontrovertible experience of ourselves, our decisions and choices, as uncaused causes"", but rather by philosophical argumentation (as positions in philosophy tend to be).  You suggest that the Compatibilist definition is very ""lenient"" and ""almost legalistic"".  But, again, what is at issue is first what conditions are required for free will.  We don't get to just assume that the Compatibilist is picking the wrong conditions that are required--especially not given Compatibilism's long history--and then treat them like they have performed a bait and switch on us.    In Underlying Problems With Materialistic Determinism, you wrote   Determinism requires that our lives and all events that occur in the universe are like a prerecorded movie, the frames of which are being played out by us and everything around us. Down to every falling of a leaf, every beating of a heart and every order for a grande nonfat vanilla latte, this movie has but one and only one, invariable and unrelenting plot line. A plot line in which we, the deterministic biological machines, are slavishly playing out our part, by following the biddings of our neurons. Helplessly watching the movie of our lives unfold and yet, thanks to the grand illusion of free will, oblivious to our own helplessness.   But if we aren't assuming Incompatibilism, this doesn't really seem like such a problematic picture.  Nothing has really been predetermined at all.  Events are necessitated by past states of the universe; but I am a part of that universe.  When we say that I am following the bidding of my neurons, we just mean that I am thinking and acting--since my thinking and acting, assuming materialism, is really just a matter of neural activity.    You suggest that if human actions are determined in this way, then they are devoid of truth, and that all discoveries are also devoid of truth.  But actions probably aren't truth-functional to begin with.  We wouldn't say that there is some truth value to by placed on the action of my running.  Truth is a property of propositions.  If we look at the proposition ""F=MA"" or ""Earth orbits the Sun"", these are true or false independent of human beings.  If there were no human beings around to judge ""F=MA"", it would still be the case that ""F=MA"" was true.  Boyd's quote is just misunderstanding what it means for something to be true or false.  We were always talking about the content of the utterance.  You go on to suggest that this makes Materialistic Determinism self-refuting in an important way, and suggest that this is something that scientists and philosophers have been ignoring, due to a dogmatic persistence with Materialistic Determinism.  The problem with this is that the majority of contemporary philosophers are compatibilists, and you have set up this issue in such a way that assumes compatibilism is false.  By the end of the article, you seem to have completely conflated Materialistic Determinism (which you defined as physical & mechanistic & causal determinism, which I take to just mean past events necessitate future events) and Incompatibilism about free will, without having given any argument for Incompatibilism (and, in fact, after giving a completely unfair treatment to Compatibilism, which is the majority position in contemporary philosophy, and likely throughout significant portions of historical philosophy).    You bring up concerns like ""Why would a determinist tell someone not to kill? Does the killer have a choice?"".  Presumably the answer to these questions is something like because those facts about the universe which determine whether or not Bob kills someone include whether or not I told them not to kill someone, whether or not they were educated in the right ways, and so on.  Even on the materialistic deterministic picture, our actions still play the relevant causal roles insofar as we are actually things in the universe.  And your subsequent discussion of ethics is again depending on this conflation between the Materialistic Determinism that you presented, and a much stronger thesis which you just helped yourself to.  At the end, you just propose quantum mechanics as a solution.  But it seems like you already, earlier in your article, gave good reason for thinking that quantum mechanics would not be a solution.  You wrote   Quantum mechanics gave rise to a new probabilistic and indeterministic foundation to physics, which for many opened the door for libertarian free will. But there were no libertarian celebrations yet, as concerns were raised about what free will was like if it arose from quantum probability and indeterminism. i.e. if probabilistic and indeterministic processes at the subatomic level amplified to the point where we experienced them as our conscious decisions, does that really qualify as being free? If you chose the apple, because of some random sub-atomic events, is that really enough to meet our definition of conscious free will?   The only way I can think of, right now, to square these things is by looking at your very last sentence, in which you mention ""immaterial aspects of our lives"".  But it seems unclear to me from where we are getting this immaterial stuff to begin with.  Presumably physics doesn't tell us about immaterial stuff."

Some replies:   “The issue isn't whether or not there is an external force acting on the physical world. The issue is what conditions are required for free will, and do those conditions ever obtain?”   This question assumes we know enough about how free will works to define the conditions required for it. My position is that we don’t. And that is the problem, the rash and immature conclusion by some folks (Sam Harris et al) who presume to already have enough empirical data to make these bold claims. Let me put this another way. The claims would be much more palatable if there was similar openness from the same groups, to allow for other major human experiential constructs, namely matter, space and time, to be illusions as well!   “Compatibilism is probably not motivated by ""our incontrovertible experience of ourselves, our decisions and choices, as uncaused causes”,”   I agree with you, this is a simplification for the sake of brevity, and it is misrepresenting motivations of the compatabilists viewpoint. My article is definitely not a source for history and causes of these different viewpoints. What I mean is that even though determinism was very successful in Physics, etc, that did not automatically make it an accepted paradigm for human action, partly due to our experience of ourself as free agents.  Compatibilism accepts the lowest grade level (based on Alfred Mele gas station analogy) of free will which requires just sanity and no coercion (Mid-grade required real options at the time of the decision, whereas premium requires a non-physical mind and soul). Personally I feel this position is a bit of copout.   “But if we aren't assuming Incompatibilism, this doesn't really seem like such a problematic picture.”   I am assuming incompatabilism (both for mid-grade and premium versions of free will). Based on our current understanding of nature, the idea an immaterial abstract entity can cause material neurobiological events is in the same neck of the woods as, me thinking of a million dollars and stacks of 100 dollar bills suddenly appearing! Even for the mid-grade, there is no mechanism consistent with determinism, which would explain how options could really be open.   “Nothing has really been predetermined at all. Events are necessitated by past states of the universe; but I am a part of that universe.”   I am not sure what you mean here. Determinism means that everything that happens is necessitated by prior conditions, and hence is predetermined.    “Truth is a property of propositions. If we look at the proposition ""F=MA"" or ""Earth orbits the Sun"", these are true or false independent of human beings. If there were no human beings around to judge ""F=MA"", it would still be the case that ""F=MA"" was true.”   So lets say there are propositions f=ma, f=mv1,  f=mv2, …..,  f=mvn. Assuming determinism is true, what principle would allow for a choice of a “correct” version from all the options? Unless human beings are determined to always gravitate towards the truth (which is demonstrably false and besides even if it were true, the question would quickly become important why it should be so), determinism entails one and only one of those would be chosen and that can have nothing to do with its “correctness”. What would correctness even mean from a deterministic perspective. Determinism only cares about what WILL happen given certain conditions, it does not have any mechanism to judge correctness. Let me use Strawson to illustrate the point. If determinism is true:  We propose what we propose because of the way we are, To be truly responsible for what we propose, we need to be truly responsible for the way we are, But we cannot responsible for the way we are, Hence what we propose is utter gloobdi-glock for which some ancient and correctness blind physical processes are responsible.  While I did not go into this in the article but another major problem with determinism is that it does not sit well with the law of conservation of information. Based on laws of conservation of information the current configuration of the matter in the universe, would have to contain all information about all the future states and events in the universe. If you play this back all the way to the big bang, the configuration of matter at the moment of the big bang would have to contain information about all events that have ever happened and that will ever happen in the universe. Where would this information be in the primordial atom and why would it be there?   “By the end of the article, you seem to have completely conflated Materialistic Determinism (which you defined as physical & mechanistic & causal determinism, which I take to just mean past events necessitate future events) and Incompatibilism about free will, without having given any argument for Incompatibilism (and, in fact, after giving a completely unfair treatment to Compatibilism, which is the majority position in contemporary philosophy, and likely throughout significant portions of historical philosophy).”   Yes I was taking an incompatibilist position without actually stating it, again for the sake of brevity and simplicity.   “Presumably the answer to these questions is something like because those facts about the universe which determine whether or not Bob kills someone include whether or not I told them not to kill someone, whether or not they were educated in the right ways, and so on.

And your subsequent discussion of ethics is again depending on this conflation between the Materialistic Determinism that you presented, and a much stronger thesis which you just helped yourself to.”   I understand that the moral principle behind the directive “do not kill” is now encoded into our social structure and hence is executed within the bounds of determinism. But that is not an irreversible process. This principle and all such moral principles were encoded in the first place, based upon the assumption of free will. If this basic assumption is undermined what would the basis of these moral principles be? Studies already conducted indicate that it WILL wither away in due time, unless we rethink the big picture. Morality requires making value judgements, which requires a judge, if free will is an illusion, there is no judge!   At the end, you just propose quantum mechanics as a solution. But it seems like you already, earlier in your article, gave good reason for thinking that quantum mechanics would not be a solution.    QM has not really been fully incorporated even into Physics yet, as too much energy is being spent on efforts to disprove it and hence save “objective reality”. I believe that once we are fully reconciled to giving up on an objective reality, is when progress can be made."

The claims would be much more palatable if there was similar openness from the same groups, to allow for other major human experiential constructs, namely matter, space and time, to be illusions as well!   People who think that free will is an illusion are an extreme minority among professional philosophers, and the non-philosophers who make these claims generally beg the question against the compatibilist because they have not engaged in any capacity with the rich philosophical literature on the subject.  There is absolutely openness in philosophy for things like matter, space, and time to be illusions.  Philosophers have famously argued for positions of these sorts.  They probably aren't popular positions; however, that would presumably be because philosophy has provided us with theories that are better alternatives.    When you say ""we know enough about how free will works"", you are already begging a question here.  Free will might not be something that ""works"" in this sense; it might not be something extra on top of business-as-usual cognitive processes, and whatnot.  Again, this is just the question of what conditions are required for free will?.     Compatibilism accepts the lowest grade level (based on Alfred Mele gas station analogy) of free will which requires just sanity and no coercion (Mid-grade required real options at the time of the decision, whereas premium requires a non-physical mind and soul). Personally I feel this position is a bit of copout.   But the question what conditions are required for free will? is just this question.  It's not a matter of how we define free will; rather, it's a matter of which of these criteria is actually what free will consists in?  It seems extremely odd for us to just assume an answer to this question which is the minority position among experts, without any argument.   I am assuming incompatabilism (both for mid-grade and premium versions of free will). Based on our current understanding of nature, the idea an immaterial abstract entity can cause material neurobiological events is in the same neck of the woods as, me thinking of a million dollars and stacks of 100 dollar bills suddenly appearing! Even for the mid-grade, there is no mechanism consistent with determinism, which would explain how options could really be open.   But if the compatibilist picture does offer an explanation for this, perhaps that suggests that we shouldn't have just assumed incompatibilism.   Determinism means that everything that happens is necessitated by prior conditions, and hence is predetermined.    To me, predetermination suggests that something has been planned in advance.  This is not the case.  Events are determined by their cases.  There is nothing that predetermines them, prior to that causal series.    So lets say there are propositions f=ma, f=mv1, f=mv2, ….., f=mvn. Assuming determinism is true, what principle would allow for a choice of a “correct” version from all the options?    Presumably humans choose between theses options based on whatever cognitive processing it is on the basis of which humans decide between options in general.     Unless human beings are determined to always gravitate towards the truth (which is demonstrably false and besides even if it were true, the question would quickly become important why it should be so), determinism entails one and only one of those would be chosen and that can have nothing to do with its “correctness”.    Presumably, on any picture, I choose between theories on the basis of evidence, informed by certain explicit and implicit biases I may have, and according to how I am paying attention to things, and so on.  It's not the pure correctness of some proposition that ever causes me to assent to that proposition.  Why should we think that on determinism I lack the capacity to evaluate propositions based on evidence? Determinism just says that past events necessitate future events. Presumably the past events doing the necessitating here are certain facts about the world (e.g., how physical properties relate to each other), facts about me (e.g., what my brain is doing at the time), and facts about my evidence (e.g., what information there is available for my brain to process).     What would correctness even mean from a deterministic perspective. Determinism only cares about what WILL happen given certain conditions, it does not have any mechanism to judge correctness.    Correctness would mean the exact same thing that on either perspective.  Presumably this would be something like some proposition P is correct if and only if that proposition corresponds to the way that the world is.  Determinism isn't a theory about epistemology.   Let me use Strawson to illustrate the point. If determinism is true:  We propose what we propose because of the way we are, To be truly responsible for what we propose, we need to be truly responsible for the way we are, But we cannot responsible for the way we are, Hence what we propose is utter gloobdi-glock for which some ancient and correctness blind physical processes are responsible.   Strawson is talking about responsibility. He isn't saying anything about an inability for us to assent to some proposition on the basis of evidence, or anything like that.  On Strawson's view, we just wouldn't be morally responsible for that action (since we aren't morally responsible for anything on Strawson's view).   While I did not go into this in the article but another major problem with determinism is that it does not sit well with the law of conservation of information. Based on laws of conservation of information the current configuration of the matter in the universe, would have to contain all information about all the future states and events in the universe. If you play this back all the way to the big bang, the configuration of matter at the moment of the big bang would have to contain information about all events that have ever happened and that will ever happen in the universe. Where would this information be in the primordial atom and why would it be there?   I don't know anything about this, so I'm not going to speak to it.   I understand that the moral principle behind the directive “do not kill” is now encoded into our social structure and hence is executed within the bounds of determinism. But that is not an irreversible process. This principle and all such moral principles were encoded in the first place, based upon the assumption of free will. If this basic assumption is undermined what would the basis of these moral principles be? Studies already conducted indicate that it WILL wither away in due time, unless we rethink the big picture. Morality requires making value judgements, which requires a judge, if free will is an illusion, there is no judge!   Of course there is still a judge if there is no free will.  It would just be the case that the judge is a fully-deterministic biological machine, devoid of free will, who cannot be held responsible for their judgments.  It doesn't somehow mean that there is no judge or no judgements.     QM has not really been fully incorporated even into Physics yet, as too much energy is being spent on efforts to disprove it and hence save “objective reality”. I believe that once we are fully reconciled to giving up on an objective reality, is when progress can be made.   But it still seems like you already gave us a good reason for thinking that QM would not be a solution to the problem, and it still seems like physics is not the sort of thing that tells us about immaterial things."

Some responses…   if the compatibilist picture does offer an explanation for this   I am of the opinion that the compatibilist position does not offer satisfactory explanation.   To me, predetermination suggests that something has been planned in advance.   We may be splitting hairs here, but if you look at the problem from an informational perspective. If within the first nano second of the big bang, a particle and its anti-particle came into existence. It had to be predetermined and encoded in the antecedent conditions that only these particle and not anything else can form. If the particle and the prevailing conditions gave rise to 3 other particles, then even this would have to be encoded in the original conditions, so on for everything that ever happened or will happen. This is predetermination. Nevertheless whether you use the word or not the problem is insurmountable for determinism.   Presumably humans choose between theses options based on whatever cognitive processing it is on the basis of which humans decide between options in general.  Presumably, on any picture, I choose between theories on the basis of evidence, informed by certain explicit and implicit biases I may have, and according to how I am paying attention to things, and so on. It's not the pure correctness of some proposition that ever causes me to assent to that proposition. Why should we think that on determinism I lack the capacity to evaluate propositions based on evidence? Determinism just says that past events necessitate future events. Presumably the past events doing the necessitating here are certain facts about the world (e.g., how physical properties relate to each other), facts about me (e.g., what my brain is doing at the time), and facts about my evidence (e.g., what information there is available for my brain to process).   Firstly it should be very clear that if all our thoughts, ideas and intellectual endeavors are a result of physical and chemical processes (according to determinism), then there can be nothing true or false. Because when we look at other such processes in nature, it would be an absurdity to say something like, “today two chemicals reacted in false manner, whereas as the other day they were true!” Chemical reactions are not true or false they react and produce something, there can be no truth or falsehood to such processes. If this is not clear then there is no point moving forward.  So based on that postulation, if determinism is true all our output is just like the chemical reactions, it is neither false nor true, it just is. It is what happens when antecedent conditions are met, which were produced further such conditions and so on.   Of course there is still a judge if there is no free will. It would just be the case that the judge is a fully-deterministic biological machine, devoid of free will, who cannot be held responsible for their judgments. It doesn't somehow mean that there is no judge or no judgements.   But this judge is not free, the options of good and bad in front of this judge do not exist. The options would have died with the death of free agency, upon which these moral principles were based. Such a society would on one hand have people who will gradually absolve themselves of responsibility for their misbehavior. And on the other could hold people accountable for a crime they are predicted to commit in the future (ala Minority Report). These conclusions are not being contested by anyone really.   But it still seems like you already gave us a good reason for thinking that QM would not be a solution to the problem, and it still seems like physics is not the sort of thing that tells us about immaterial things.   Physics may or may not tell us about immaterial things, but Physics could arise out of them! IMO physics starts to happen when a question is posed by a conscious being and not before."

If this is a wholly material and biological or chemical phenomenon, then it happens to be the case that wholly material and biological or chemical phenomenon can sometimes have propositional content.  The truth or falsity of some proposition depends on something like whether or not that proposition corresponds to the way that the world actually is.  Presumably the majority of phenomena do not have propositional content.  As I said, "" If we look at the proposition 'F=MA' or 'Earth orbits the Sun', these are true or false independent of human beings. If there were no human beings around to judge 'F=MA', it would still be the case that 'F=MA' was true.""    (As a side note, it's not really clear that it is determinism which says that all of our thoughts, ideas, and intellectual endeavors are results of physical and chemical processes.  We can assume that determinism is false, yet still accept that all of our thoughts, ideas, and intellectual endeavors are the result of physical and chemical processes.

Yeah, so moral responsibility would probably be impossible on that picture.  Presumably if people are absolving themselves of responsibility, this is something which would be happening necessarily given the causal history of the universe.  Similarly, if people are not absolved of responsibility, this would also happen necessarily given the causal history of the universe.  The basis of whatever moral principles we adopt would just be whatever it is on the basis of which we chose those moral principles over others.  It's not like we cease to make those judgements--in fact, we were always making them, despite lacking free will.   Physics may or may not tell us about immaterial things, but Physics could arise out of them! IMO physics starts to happen when a question is posed by a conscious being and not before.

I don't think that the compatibilist has to accept determinism, strictly speaking.  I think that most compatibilists would be perfectly content if the universe turned out to be nondeterministic in some way (per some sort of randomness at some microscopic level).  They would just say that this low-level randomness doesn't have any bearing on the sorts of criteria which are important when it comes to free will--which have to do with a capacity for reflection, or deliberation, and stuff of that sort.     Based on what I understand a proposition to be, I cannot agree with that. A physical or chemical process cannot make proposition.   There are people who have argued for similar things (e.g., Plantinga).  The thing is that we do have things with propositional content.  If we think (presumably based on some sort of argument) that this isn't possible given only physical or chemical stuff (i.e., on a physicalist ontology), then maybe there's more to the world than physical and chemical stuff.  But that is tangential to the determinism/indeterminism debate.  Even if we expand our ontology to accommodate the stipulation that physical and chemical stuff isn't sufficient for propositional content, we could still accept determinism about causation.    But at this point, we would be helping ourselves to multiple controversial theses, without argument for any of them.   QM has been telling us that would not be the case. If humans were not around there would be no force, no mass, no acceleration, instead they would be blur of possibilities, whose blurry monotony would only be broken by a conscious being posing a question.

QM is not telling us this.  It is extremely unclear if interpretations of QM require consciousness for observation, and it seems highly unlikely that measurement would presuppose consciousness.  In any case, it is not the laws governing physical interactions which are indeterministic on indeterministic interpretations of QM.     I agree, but it is also possible that reality is not solely deterministic, that it is humans intentions that introduces indeterminism into an otherwise deterministic system. Also that the source of the human conscious intentions and all the elements of the deterministic system we call reality is the same as yet unknown property or process.

If determinism is true, and we reject free will, the basis for these actions is just whatever causal sequence led to those events taking place.  It's just whatever facts about their brain, their environment, their society, and so on, are relevant to those events.

I think that there is a but of a difference between being more likely to cheat on a test after being told that you don't have free will and a Mad Max world or worse.  Psychology seems to tell us that all sorts of organisms tend toward pro-social behaviour.  Insofar as this is driven by biology, it seems unlikely that the suggestion ""you don't have free will"" could be the undoing of these overarching tendencies.     That is the thing though Physics has been telling us that you need the immaterial (conscious observer) to produce the material world. We just have not done a good job listening.   Physics does not tell us this.  I am sure that there are some physicists who believe this, but it is not something that is believed on the basis of physics.    And even if we did have good reason for thinking that observation presupposed consciousness, we would need further reason for thinking that consciousness is an immaterial phenomenon (which is another minority position among professional philosophers--an extreme minority if we are talking about substantive immaterialism)."

People who are born with insufficient parents, parents that unfortunately condition them to be ignorant and fail, will be given an incredible disadvantage in life.  And so what? Human life is suffering, right? Some win, some lose. But it doesn't have to be that way. We can structure society so that people do not have inherent advantages, or make it so all humans can live their lives with near equivalent levels of happiness (ie, Brave New World).  Look at religion. If free will is proven not to exist, then God cannot exist. That WILL definitely make a difference.  From day to day life, I agree that it really makes no difference.

NO quantum mechanics is not proven to be indeterministic at all. If you actually read the history of quantum interpretations you would see that it was mainly politics that lead to the Copenhagen Interpretation taking frontseat position post-1927 Solvay conference.  Neither Albert Einstein, Erwin Schrödinger, Paul Dirac, Louis de-Broglie or Max Born accepted this explanation. If you read some of their old papers you would know this. In fact Louis de-Broglie came up with an idea (pilot waves) that was later rediscovered by David Bohm. This is 100% deterministic. Not to mention Hugh Everett's Many Worlds Interpretation. Also 100% deterministic. Or what about Gerard 't Hoofts superdeterminist cellular automata? Or the retrocausal interpretations in the vein of Huw Price, Ken Wharton and so on? Deterministic.   Absolutely nothing in quantum physics even hint towards indeterminism unless you randomly postulate that there is no deeper fundamental reality. Which you could equally say in Newtons time.   And even if we take the crazy pills and assume for no reason at all that quantum mechanics somehow lead to fundamental indeterminism, this still does not yield you any free will.

As I mentioned to some other folks, towards the end I do setup what I hope to be follow-up article on subjects of QM, Relativity, etc. Briefly though on QM, on Pilot Wave/Hidden Variables see my response to see996able.   Many-worlds is non starter and IMO a non-starter theory because it introduces infinities. In MWI, the universe splits into separate universes on every interaction/decision. If you ask the person over to your right, “Give me a number, any number”, you just split the universe into infinite number of branches where the person replied with all possible infinite numbers and all possible non-numbers (because she can). You did not just create the huge number of universes you might have thought of but all (infinite) universes each one will spawn individually. This proposal IMO becomes very weak since no natural process can sustain infinities. In general the moment a theory generates infinities is when you should worry because infinities are abstract mental concepts which do not exist in nature.  Retrocausality was an obvious out come after delayed choice thought experiment were confirmed by  successful delayed choice quantum eraser experiments, but these do anything but confirm determinism! This theory is very interesting to me when you combine it with the backwards time referral effects being investigated in neuroscience.  Hooft super determinism is not even full blown interpretation of QM, it is another proposal based on hidden variables theory, which claims the an unknown force is causing dissipation of these hidden variables at the quantum level producing discrete quantization. It also proposes that a particle from a distant quasar display quantum behavior because the choice of measurement made by a scientist on Earth is influenced by a primordial connection between the said quasar particle and the particles in the experimenter’s brain! He may use the word superdeterminism but Hooft’s model would have us radically undermine most of existing physics, which it is not likely to do successfully. If you are going to go with this, you are much better off with QBism by Fuchs and Schack.  I have no problem with these or any of the theories including determinism. If you looks at them deeply, they all are trying say this in one way or another:  “It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how nature is. Physics concerns what we can say about nature.” - Neils Bohr  Once you appreciate what QM and Relativity imply from an epistemological perspective, you become much more open to allowing for different descriptions of nature, even using different ones as horses for courses, but with the understanding that none of them describe reality as it truly is."

However, in support of that, Olson literally says:    [T]he issue here is at a bedrock metaphysical level. It is difficult for error theorists to convince those who find nothing queer about irreducible normativity. And vice versa, of course. So the stubborn response from the non-naturalist seems to leave her and the error theorist in a stalemate, staring incredulously at each other.   And I think he is entirely right as far as scholarly work on Mackie goes. Mackie neither provided a definition for queerness, nor did he even give an argument for why queerness would lead us to reject something. In that respect, the argument from queerness is in need of some serious updating.  (Note: apologies for anyone that has already read this part when I posted it last month, but it does seem relevant). I recently finished my MA thesis on this topic, where I offered the following reformulation of the argument from queerness:   MORAL FACTS are queer. (i.e. additional fundamental ontological commitments) MORAL FACTS are dispensable. (i.e. we can explain all relevant phenomenon without them) IF any ontological posit is queer and dispensable, THEN we should to reject its existence. We should reject the existence of MORAL FACTS.   MORAL FACT: the truth-maker of moral claims, whatever that truth-maker may be (e.g. objective values, irreducibly normative relations, etc.)  Additional: a posit in addition to other posits we commonly accept.   Fundamental: a posit that requires an entirely new ontological domain with unique feature(s). For example, the posit of the Higgs boson is a physical posit because it has only features (i.e. mass, causality, etc.) of the physical domain; however, MORAL FACTS would require a new domain with the unique feature of normative force.  With queerness defined as it is here, claim 1 should be accepted wholeheartedly by non-naturalist moral realists. The only claim of contention to them should be claim 2. Now we can bring in other arguments (such as evolutionary debunking arguments, the argument from disagreement, moral projectivism, etc.) to physically explain our moral beliefs. So long as we can in principle completely physically explain our moral beliefs, claim 2 is true.  The crucial point is that the non-naturalist is faced with the following dilemma:  D1: Either the non-naturalist shows how our moral beliefs and practice cannot be entirely explained without positing MORAL FACTS, or they should reject the existence of MORAL FACTS.

philosophy,3cko9g,adrianscholl,6,Thu Jul 9 02:25:38 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth Mackie at least seems to have in mind something like your argument. As Olson tells it the queerness argument involves two steps: showing that moral facts are objectionably queer and then showing how we can do without them.  However, I'm not sure that your reformulation really captures these two steps in the way that Olson and Mackie might want to. In order to see this let's consider why we don't merely say as an argument against moral realism that we can explain all the relevant phenomena by referring only to various psychological, sociological, and evolutionary facts. That is, why don't we just skip to the second step of the argument? Well obviously the realist is just going to rebut ""ah, but none of these things explain the irreducibly normativity of morality."" Thus we need to include the first step in Olson's retelling of the argument: show that irreducible normativity is objectionably queer, so it's not a facet of morality that needs to be explained.  Now what you seem to have in mind is that queerness involves simply additional ontological commitments. But merely requiring additional ontological commitments doesn't seem like a reason to shoot down irreducible normativity by itself. So it seems to me like the natural response for the realist to your reformulation is the very response that Olson means to block: ""these naturalistic facts of yours don't explain the irreducible normativity of morality.""  So it seems like you'll have to say something to get us to dismiss the notion of irreducible normativity and Olson's queerness argument just so happens to fill this very role."
philosophy,3cko9g,dunkeater,2,Thu Jul 9 06:27:20 2015 UTC,"But merely requiring additional ontological commitments doesn't seem like a reason to shoot down irreducible normativity by itself   I wholeheartedly agree. But my argument does not refute irreducible normativity (IN) simply on the grounds that P1) it requires additional ontological commitments. The argument has more premises than that. It seems quite uncharitable to isolate one of those premises and ask whether we can get the conclusion with that premise alone.   Let's look at the argument as a whole. We can see it is quite clearly  valid. That means that, if the premises are true, then the conclusion follows. So, to avoid the conclusion, you are going to have to reject one of the premises.   Here is another way to think about the argument that might make it clearer:   1) IN requires additional ontological commitments 2) IN is dispensable 3) entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily ∴) we should reject IN.   Perhaps one thing that is throwing you off is that you are thinking of the argument as occurring in stages, like Olson's argument. Olson first argues against IN simply because it is queer at a metaphysical bedrock level. Then he separately argues that non-queer ontologies are simpler (and thus preferable) to queer ontologies. By the time he has gotten to the second stage, he has already rejected IN.  My argument is different in that I am not trying to get to the rejection of IN strictly from the first premise, and then appeal to ontological parsimony. Rather, ontological parsimony (P3) is part of my argument for rejecting IN. Hopefully that clears up the confusion."
philosophy,3cko9g,dunkeater,2,Thu Jul 9 16:32:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not really sure how your argument is a queerness argument, then. Indeed there are arguments in this same style out there in the metaethical literature (Harman's, for instance), but these arguments don't purport to be queerness arguments.

Premise #3 just makes explicit the implicit premise of the queerness argument - if some entity is queer (and dispensable), then we should reject it."
philosophy,3cko9g,adrianscholl,2,Thu Jul 9 18:33:41 2015 UTC,"It starts with the same objection - moral (or irreducibly normative) facts are queer.    /u/adrianscholl uses the term queer, but they seem to mean by it only that moral facts involve additional ontological commitments, as opposed to the classical way of construing the term such that moral facts are somehow strange or weird in objectionable ways.   Additionally it seems to me as though we could remove the word ""queer"" (or its synonyms) from the argument and just end up with Harman's argument, which is not a queerness argument. Namely: moral facts are explanatorily dispensible, we shouldn't have ontological commitments to things that are explanatorily dispensible (parsimony), so we shouldn't have ontological commitments to moral facts."

philosophy,3cko9g,hayshed,5,Fri Jul 10 08:28:04 2015 UTC,"It does occupy a sort of middle ground between Mackie, Harman, and ontological parsimony arguments. I'll briefly lay out some very rough versions of those three arguments, the central objections to them, and why I think my argument is a superior mix of them.  Mackie's argument from queerness:   MORAL FACTS are queer (i.e. their difference from everything else is metaphysically objectionable). We should reject the existence of any entity that is queer. We should reject MORAL FACTS.   Objection: I simply see nothing queer about MORAL FACTS. Your argument is essentially table-pounding without an argument to actually convince me that they are queer.  My argument is superior to Mackie's because it explains what is queer about MORAL FACTS: they would require a new domain with the unique feature of normative force. This is also a great premise in the argument because it is the core commitment of non-naturalism.  Harman's argument from explanatory irrelevance:   MORAL FACTS are explanatorily irrelevant (i.e. moral observations are evidence for moral sentiments not MORAL FACTS). We should reject the existence of any entity that is explanatorily irrelevant. We should reject MORAL FACTS.   Objection: You are begging the question by assuming MORAL FACTS cannot explain anything. The fact that Hitler was morally depraved explains his behavior, because, according to moral realism, moral depravity supervenes on his behavior. If he was not morally depraved, then he would not have acted as he did. (see Sturgeon 1985)  My argument is superior to Harman's argument because it concedes that MORAL FACTS have explanatory power, while maintaining his central point that we can explain all relevant phenomenon without positing them.  Simple ontological parsimony argument   MORAL FACTS are not necessary to our best theory (i.e. naturalism). We should reject the existence of entities that are not necessary to our best theory. We should reject MORAL FACTS.   Objection: You are assuming that metaphysical naturalism is our best theory. I grant you that MORAL FACTS are not necessary to naturalism (in fact it rules them out), but I think more than natural things exist, namely MORAL FACTS exist. Your argument does nothing to convince me that MORAL FACTS do not exist.  My argument is superior to this ontological parsimony argument, because it does not assume the truth of metaphysical naturalism. The more I read Mackie, the more I think that he is implicitly relying on an assumption that metaphysical naturalism is simply true. That would obviously beg the question against the non-naturalist. So, while my argument has an appeal to ontological parsimony, it is neutral as to which ontology is ultimately correct.  Now recall the argument from queerness revised that I offered:   MORAL FACTS are queer. (i.e. additional fundamental ontological commitments) MORAL FACTS are dispensable. (i.e. we can explain all relevant phenomenon without them) IF any ontological posit is queer and dispensable, THEN we should to reject its existence. We should reject the existence of MORAL FACTS.   You might think my argument is not really a queerness argument. But it crucially contains the fundamental elements of a queerness argument (MORAL FACTS are metaphysically different in some sense that ultimately makes them objectionable) and it makes explicit an ontological parsimony assumption that I think is implicit in Mackie's argument. Personally I think that it is quite clearly filling in the missing details to Mackie's argument, and so is best understood as the argument from queerness revised. However, whatever we ultimately call it aside, it certainly warrants a response."

philosophy,3cko9g,hackinthebochs,2,Thu Jul 9 03:24:45 2015 UTC,"Is there something in particular that we are supposed to be considering?  At any rate, queerness arguments strike me as being misplaced.  Arguments from queerness rest on the already antecedent fact that we find the particular ontology suggested to lack certain positive virtues, e.g. coherence, simplicity, empirical access, or whatever.  There is no way to reconcile competing virtue belief structures if say I were to value foundational systems, complexity, and intuitiveness.  The ontological structures that I am going to accept will satisfy my, perhaps idiosyncratic, value structure and this in turn will indicate roughly the number and type of new categories I will accept.  Thus, it seems, arguments from queerness rest on a large number of dialectical assumptions about some as yet unspecified notion of rationality.  This should be worrisome since agreement in any argument that rests on queerness is not going to be rational agreement but merely an accidental convergence in methods of assessing a theories fitness.  In other words, arguments from queerness only work between those who are already in agreement on an issue in which case the argument need not be given in the first place."
philosophy,3cko9g,gangstacompgod,2,Thu Jul 9 04:28:23 2015 UTC,"Can we avoid this problem by throwing away issues of motivation and the normative and instead simply recognize primitive morally relevant values? For example:  Sentient individuals are capable of experiencing, and those experiences may be neutral, positive or negative. That capacity to experience would provide the morally relevant values. I'm just going to use ""pleasure"" and ""suffering"" for convenience, but I don't really think the label is important, so we could say positive experience/pleasure/good experience/pleasant experience (or conversely negative experience/suffering/bad experience/unpleasant experience/aversive experience, whatever).  We might not be able to deploy a ""should"" but we could talk about how actions affect those values in the same way we can talk about other facts. Plunging the dagger into someone's chest is likely to reduce the positive value and increase negative values, for example. We could compare this effect with other potential actions.  Of course, this doesn't help prove that experiences/qualia/whatever exist and if someone is inclined to believe that we're all just zombies and qualia are an illusion then certain this argument won't be very compelling (and it won't matter if they happen to be correct, since all states of affairs will be equivalent when objective moral values don't exist.)  Also, this is essentially a very primitive form of utilitarianism. There's no necessary connection between the motivation to maximize the positive value/minimize the negative value and the positiveness or negativeness of those values. There isn't even a readily apparent way to compare suffering with pleasure. Someone looking for a fully fledged moral objective moral system probably won't find that state of affairs very satisfactory."

""Ought"" feels very real and objective to people, and they have a large emotional attachment to it, putting it as part of outside reality instead of part of themselves.    Okay, but we're still left with a couple problems here. For one, it seems to me that moral facts, beliefs, and actions are at frequent odds with what one desires to do. I want to do few to none of the morally right actions I perform, I do them because I believe myself to be obligated. Furthermore, as I've just illustrated, it makes sense for someone volunteering, for instance, to talk about how they would rather be at home sleeping instead, yet continuing to volunteer. The only way this seems reasonable (which it does to me, and should to you as well) is if there are reasons which do not reduce to desires. On the other hand, someone eating a pie while talking about how they hate pie and would rather be eating anything else strikes us as considerably more bizarre, because here, there is no non-desire-based motivation at play. So is the behavior of the agent volunteering really as suspect as the behavior of the agent eating pie? That's what your theory would commit us to. Taking this reasoning a step further, or perhaps just to make the thrust of this argument more clear, it seems to me that someone in your position would have to say of someone who ruins their expensive new shoes saving a drowning child in a lake was not rationally responding to reasons. This strikes me as very false.   Furthermore, even if I cede that this functions as a competent explanation of our conceptions of moral reasons, what motivates this account? If I already have a plausible explanation, viz. moral facts, why should I reject that explanation and embrace yours instead? It's not clear to me that you can motivate such a switch unless one is already committed to the damnable queerness of moral facts and the concordant new theoretical desideratum of avoiding them at all costs.   ""Ought"" statements are only true if moral realism is true. I did not say that ought statements made no sense. I said that they make sense in context of non-objective and personal oughts.   Well, some of them make sense (or are true in) those contexts, like, ""If you want to drink, drink,"" or ""If you are going to be prudent, you ought to study for this test."" But what about ""You ought not believe things without evidence?"" Is this not true, regardless of agential beliefs and desires? Are you an epistemic anti-realist too? Epistemic facts seem to have all the objectionable features of moral facts.    If you are in an argument about the truth of moral realism, just assuming that moral realism is true is not very productive. You need to go from what we both agree on to moral realism. You have just been saying that moral anti-realism is convincing because moral realism is true. It's not a good line of argument.   I'm not assuming moral realism is true. In fact, you're the one who's taking their argument to be true for granted. I'm saying that certain aspects of the antirealist picture seem to me to be deeply, almost unacceptably unintuitive, and I think I'm entitled to  substantive explanation of why I'm mistaken or should accept the antirealist account regardless. You've given me nothing to this effect."
philosophy,3cko9g,eaturbrainz,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:53:47 2015 UTC,"Well, the ethical naturalist would say that a specific class of natural facts explain why.  The non-naturalist realist faces the problem that she's positing two explanations for the entirely physical jumping behavior: one natural, and one normative.  If the normative is agreed to describe the natural, rather than participate in natural causality, then you face two problems as a robust realist:   How does moral cognition reliably connect to moral facts?  That is, since the normative is not just causally distinct from the non-normative (like how apples are distinct from oranges, but are both fundamentally kinds of natural objects) but metaphysically distinct, existing only as an abstract property, then how does the causally-participating, physically-embodied human being get access to it in the first place? What with parsimony arguments, why should we posit an ontologically distinct, fully abstract property of normativity, and treat it as ""real"" in the same sense of the word ""real"" used for ordinary properties like redness or set cardinality?   I will offer no responses to these questions, since I'm more convinced by arguments for naturalism than I am for ""robust"" realism, which seems to me an exercise in trying to posit some component of reality that cares about us, other than us ourselves, against all available evidence, even if we have to claim this posited component of reality has no power to effect ordinary events or objects at all."

He shed alot of light on this for me, although I'm admittedly nowhere near your level of understanding.   I really feel a need to question how raw intuitionism about anything sheds light on anything, given the known fact that intuitions are subject to the personality of the individual, the culture the individual grew up in, and the education received by the individual.  If intuitions are just functions of who you are and how your life has gone, and they are, how on Earth are they supposed to act as reliable guides to some external, metaphysical truth?"

And while they are certainly revisable in the face of reason or conflicting intuitions, they compose the heart of all moral reasoning. They are not just some small idea that can be cast aside.   That is to say, I don't even think it's possible to deduce a moral value entirely from a non-moral fact.

Basically, I'm a fan of the Churchlands, who have tended to advocate a flagrantly Pragmatist epistemology and a philosophy of mind to match.  The upshot?  All thinking is theory-laden and subject to training by experience.  Thus, there's no such thing as an ""intellectual seeming"" or, and this is important, a ""propositional attitude"".  Propositional attitudes split your thinking into overly-rigid Boolean logic: things are true or false with nothing in-between.  As far as we can tell, reality, at the scale in which we operate on a daily basis, mostly works that way.  Time certainly seems to make it work that way, in that past events are fully determined, and so propositions about the past are either true or false.  But knowledge doesn't work that way at all.  You never know anything so absolutely as to say, ""Proposition P is True!"", only to be able to say, ""I act as if P because it seems far more plausible than otherwise"".  Plausibility comes from internal coherence, matching with past experience, etc.  This means I can't take on a Principle of Phenomenal Conservatism (""in the absence of defeating arguments, things that just seem true, should be taken as true""), because I'm using a Principle of Phenomenal Plausibility (""in the absence of further evidence for or against, things that seem plausible can be considered genuinely plausible, at least insofar as they cohere with other things I'm surer of, remembering that my psychological sense of intuitive plausibility has been shaped by my past experiences, which may not match present facts"").  The difference surely sounds very subtle, but a Principle of Phenomenal Plausibility actually renders intuitionist positions on metaphysically queer kinds of knowledge almost totally implausible, simply because my experiences have been shaped by non-queer realms, and my intuitions are unlikely to match reality where my experiences are lacking."

By that, I mean that the best argument against anti-realism is one of practicality - anti-realism necessarily reduces ethical/moral debate to a metaethical debate, so if you want to discuss an issue of morality, there is no way in.  To put it another way, the existence of moral facts and categorical imperatives are axioms of moral discourse, just as 1+1=2 is an axiom of mathematical discourse.

On the other hand, you seem to agree with Enoch that,     ...we must proceed forward by considering the available arguments and weighing the plausibility of the competing metaethical theories in light of all of these arguments.   It's not clear to me how there could be a way forward for both those who uphold some kind of irreducible normativity and those who dismiss it out of hand.  It seems to me that the whole point of the argument from queerness is to pre-empt further discussion about realism--either that or it is a very clever ruse to get us to embrace queerness."

The way forward for the realist is, I think, to produce either some indispensability arguments (as Enoch has done) or to deny that irreducible normativity is objectionably queer by showing that it proves too much (edit: that the claim to objectionable queerness proves too much, I mean). Recall that the first two queerness arguments were found to be less than satisfactory because, if successful, they would also disprove some additional views which we have some good reasons to think are true. Some such as Cuneo, Bedke, and Rowland have suggested that if irreducible normativity is objectionably queer, then epistemic normativity is at stake. That is, if we accept the queerness argument then we're committed to some strange claims like ""moral error theory is correct, but I have no reason to believe that it is,"" ""realists believe something that is demonstrably false, but they are not guilty of any rational mistake,"" or ""nobody can know anything.""  So this is the way forward for the realist. Olson has some replies to these sorts of objections, but that's really a topic worthy of a whole 'nother post.  As for ways forward for the anti-realist, Olson seems to think that by showing how our moral practices can be explained by referring only to various naturalistic facts (via things like evolutionary debunking arguments), we can cast further doubt on the realist's convictions. This is why I suggest that metaethics involves weighing the totality of arguments. Presumably Olson thinks that enough arguments can be put forth for the error theorist's position that the realist only thread will be stubborn denial of the queerness intuition. And once it's the case that this is the only thread available even the most diehard realist will find their position much less compelling.  Edit edit: of course these ways forward just apply to robust realists and error theorists. There might be different ways forward for views not covered here. E.g. constructivism, naturalism, and so on."

If I read him correctly, this is similar to a point that Nagel makes in Mind and Cosmos with respect to teleology, which he argues is a foundational necessity in order to make sense of our ability to make sense.  Of course Nagel is arguing against naturalism, and not so much for moral realism, but it seems to me that if we follow Nagel on this, we might use Cuneo, Bedke, and Rowland style arguments to reverse the charge of queerness back to the moral error theorist to the extent that she rejects irreducible normativity.

I can only think of a response, which is that there's nothing about moral facts that would link them with me as an agent, but I think logical facts, which aren't exactly natural facts, are just as detached from me as moral facts and yet I have no problem using logical facts as part of a favouring relation (although I guess one could argue that these logical facts aren't as ""intrinsic"" to the favouring as the moral facts)."

Is this argument analogous to:  ""man stealing bread is wrong"" and   ""man feeding his family is right"" and   ""man stealing bread feeds his family"" therefore  ""man stealing bread is wrong"" and  ""man stealing bread is right"" which means  ""man stealing bread is wrong"" is morally queer?"

As the apple’s cells change, so does the apple’s ripeness. Importantly, there can be no change in the apple’s ripeness without a change in the its physical makeup.   Ah, so supervenience is the philosophical way of saying ""intertheoretic reduction"", where a high-level concept precisely circumscribes the state-space of a more reductionistic physical model (or of the reality being modeled).

Villages that plant only grass are less likely to survive than villages that plant corn, wheat, and soy.  The thing that seems to make moral facts queer, is that there are many implications left out of moral statements that are actually contained within the statement.  Take a statement like: Murdering all babies is wrong. What the statement really means is something more like: A society will cease to function if all members of the society die out.  The reason that people fail to understand all the unstated assumptions in a moral statement is because just by calling it a moral statement we insert the idea that the statement applies to the harm or benefit of society. This must be true because we all know and agree that morality does not exist outside of human society. Morality does not apply to animals and we don't expect animals to behave morally, but we do expect animals to behave in a manner that is most likely to result in the continuation of their species. The difference is that we are able to discuss and contemplate the consequences of our actions, while we have no knowledge regarding the ability of other animals to do so.  Moral facts seem queer because of the unstated premises contained in them that reflect the application of those statements to human society, but once those unstated premises are stated, the moral facts lose the properties of queerness.  Take your fact: The fact that my donating blood will save lives counts in favour of my donating blood.  This should really be re-written as: The fact that for my society to continue to exist, people in my society are required to donate blood counts in favor of my donating blood.  The further ambiguity comes in when you account for the fact that individuals can get away with violating the moral code as long as most people are following it, which applies to your chess example as well.  If you take your chess example: The fact that rules of chess restrict bishops to diagonal motions counts in favour of my only moving my bishops diagonally.  You might conclude that moving your bishops in other ways would actually make you more likely to win as long as you are not caught doing it, because your opponent would not be able to account for such moves."

Moral realism is the belief that there are true objective facts about morality while beauty is definitionally subjective.  The point that I was making is that the reason that anyone would disagree about the definition of morality is because of the unstated assumptions.  The commonly known definition: principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. Leaves out the necessary unstated assumptions that once overtly stated make the definition easier to understand.  The definition must include the relationship between the individual and society, otherwise it makes no sense. The moral rules that we all think about have to do with our impact on other people. By denying that part of the definition you render the term meaningless. We are historically sloppy in defining our words because the unstated premises are part of our general understanding and taking the time to write them out would be wasted effort, until we have a disagreement about how the word should be used.  Would you argue that the definition of morality does not include the unstated premise that it applies to human beings? It should read: principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior of human beings. It also includes the place where the behavior is to be performed, which is within society.

I agree, or perhaps some do fully understand and just don't care enough to have them stop them.

To get the premise all the way to it's natural foundation, you need to turn it the other way around: The purpose of morality is to enforce the continuation of society.  Morality is a consequence of the existence of society, not a separate construct. We don't have moral rules first and then we apply them to a society, the rules only come into being as a result of the existence of society. You wouldn't say that the force that mass exerts is a result of the rules of gravity, you would say that gravity is a force that is exerted as a result of the existence of matter. Morality exists because people must behave in certain ways in order for a society to function. If people did not behave in those ways the society would cease to exist."

If matter started to disobey the laws of gravity, then it would fall apart and stop being matter. If people ignored morality, then society would fall apart and stop being society.  Animals that live in societies also have certain behaviors that allow the society to continue to function. The difference with morality, is that humans can comprehend the why and actually think about the existence of the rules, rather than just instinctively obeying our natural urges. The rules governing those behaviors that arise in animals would not be considered queer, yet the purpose of those behaviors is to enforce the continuation of society.

Cartesian dualism about the mind might be said to be metaphysically queer. That is, the mind which is supposedly non-physical is said to exert causal influence upon the brain, which is physical. Such a relationship is metaphysically mysterious and therefore objectionably queer.   Take a statement like: Murdering all babies is wrong. What the statement really means is something more like: A society will cease to function if all members of the society die out.   As I say in the OP the target of queerness arguments is not moral naturalism.

philosophy,3cizy8,EuclideanPsychosis,26,Wed Jul 8 07:48:02 2015 UTC,"The problem for me is that all value and meaning can only exist in contexts. Without context no value and meaning is possible. In absolute isolation, nothing means anything and has no definable value. When I hear ""intrinsic value"", I hear the concept of isolation from context being imposed on the concept of value. In my thinking this only serves to negate the term value. I see the primary context to construct a definition of individual value as the framework of benefit to society. Just as the value of a cell is commonly seen in its role in the health of the body, the same is true of individual humans to their society. I can say that, intrinsic to the concept of a society made of individual human members, each member has value. I can also say that imposing too much social conformity on each individual with regard to predefined valuations restricts the diversity with which a society is capable of meeting the challenges of thriving. Allowing individual variation, as much as possible, from commonly defined values helps increase the genius of a society. Sometimes the greatest value of individuality is when it defies everything a society believes in a way that creates new information and new ideas useful to the evolution of humanity (cognitively speaking)."

philosophy,3cizy8,waltwear,7,Wed Jul 8 10:37:19 2015 UTC,"The idea of ""greater value"" would have to be defined. How is the more and less of this measured? At one level, the idea that one person has a duty to make sacrifices for the greater or common good is present in almost all societies in history. The individual cell will perish before the larger body. The heath of the body does have a longer lifespan and is involved with a much greater scope of energy than an individual. If this is sufficient, then the answer is yes. The sheer mass of and longevity of a society has greater weight. It is not just the value but also the deficits that count in the measure. ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one. (pardon the Star Trek reference)""  On the other hand, if value is not just a measure of mass and longevity, it must consider more specific functionality. Here, the value of the individual cannot be assessed relative to a society without considering its function. Our species seems more naturally inclined to form social groups than many species filled with loner individuals who wander about mostly independently from other members. To the extent that an individual human can be defined in terms of their social nature, can an individual value of a person be defined independently of society? If the accurate definition of a human individual is necessarily composed with a social element, then individual value cannot even be completely defined without a social connection. How is more and less defined when identity definitions have become blended?  A  problem I have is the question of how the more or less is constructed. If the value is more, then what is the nature and structure of that more? If value is defined in simple terms of mass, it is easy to assume that a larger body will have ""more"" value than an individual cell. But if value is defined in other contexts this becomes irrelevant. Another element in defining value is the consideration of complexity. We are instinctively inclined to associate increasing valuation with increasing complexity. If that is the dominant consideration than one well developed individual can be more valuable than a destructively simple society. Generally, societies are capable of much greater diversity and complexity than an individual. I believe this is why there is more than one of us. Of what value is the cell if the body dies? Of what use is a body when all the individual cells are unhealthy? The intertwining of identity and function blurs separating distinctions of the measure of value.  An important question I ask myself is, ""Is there anything that is necessary for all possible definitions of human value, social or individual?"" This leads to questioning the meaning of life and the nature of the universe. I am not capable of defining the construction of the idea of ""value"" in the context of associations (the universe) needed to do it with the formal rigor with which I would be happy. I am less able to define the operations needed to define more an less for an undefinable framework of measure (the valuable human). I am even less able to apply these undefinable general concepts to make questionable distinctions between societies and individuals. What I do know is that human living does best when we optimize our diversity and complexity. Failing to allow as much individual freedom to do this as is useful is a notorious weakness of societies. This negatively impacts the capacity to define and realize ""the valuable"" in both individual and societal existence.  If we take the concept of ""health"" as a baseline of measure. What is truly healthy in an individual or a society? What does it mean for an individual to live well by the notion of health? Can the health of an individual be defined separately from the health of their social context? If not, where does the question of measuring value find its basis for making distinctions of greater and lesser between individuals and societies? The simple notion of measuring mass seems to want to intrude into my thinking at this point, but that may be a defect of my thinking."
philosophy,3cizy8,filosophikal,2,Wed Jul 8 11:32:10 2015 UTC,"I personally view value as a construct of entropy and enthalpy. But I also view entropy and enthalpy as more than just a basic force that affects only primitive matter, I see it as something that enters into all level of abstraction (if a company makes a loss this quarter, its due to increased entropy on the company 'system', that is to say the parts that make the whole were not functioning optimally). I see entropy as a force that propagates like a wave through systems from low to high (if you think of a long stick held vertically, a small wobble at its base propagates and amplifies into a larger wobble at its tip, you need strong and stable foundations to maintain higher abstractions of systems, like the financial markets or society as a whole). If you take the Boltzmann version of entropy it is merely the probability of micro states converging into a macro state, where entropy is the majority of macro states (the undesirable) and enthalpy the minority of macro states (the desirable).  This brings value in the sense that you want to optimise for maintaining the highest states of enthalpy for the longest period of time. You want your company to continually be profitable for as long as you can maintain it, you want to feel healthy for as long as you can, and you want to minimise civil unrest for as long as you can. Value then is synonymous with enthalpy, the more ordered something is the greater its value."

We are also a component part in the structure of larger bodies (society, the biological system we live in). The possibility of idea of individual value seems to be related to the specificity of function. On the non-value end, an individual part in an engine has no value except that which is defined by its function in the combustion engine. Here the whole is the final arbiter of value. This is because in a combustion engine each part has a unique function. In a human society, humans have a very similar baseline of function. At a basic level, what one person can do, another person can do. I believe that this is what makes the concept of independent individual value possible because if each human had an absolutely unique function in society then value can only be defined in terms of the whole they serve. It is all that humans share in common that gives us the mental room to consider the idea of ""individual value"".  Ironically, what we share in common seems to me to be the basis of constructing the idea of individual value. Here, I am not imposing the idea of the individual on the concept of value.

I think these are important questions. I am personally an existential nihilist and I see no issue with assigning value. I think many want it to be intrinsic because they feel that, if it is subjective, it is worthless. I disagree. I think a reasonable consensus can be formed and we can excel within that structure, as moral individuals.   The fact that you deny me helping you does not erase the fact that i did help you.    I mean, the ""fact?"" You're misusing that term. You can try to help people and they may agree it is helpful. If they don't, how are you right over them simply because they cannot ""deny"" it? How does that make it factual?  Let's say, for example, in order to save a watchmaker's life, I had to cut his arms off. Complete hypothetical here, obviously.  Now, watchmaking is his entire life and he'd be empty without it. Now, the watchmaker would rather die than have his arms cut off because he could not do what he loved.

People are born, live, and die without significantly impacting the world around them. It's very sad. They might as well have never existed.  So I guess my criterion for exceptionality is contribution to one's species, and by that criterion, it is very much possible to value oneself without fostering a general love for other people.

Until death.  As a collective, we may accrue value to some lives, but that's purely a human construct, as in, ""what can you do for me that I consider valuable?""  As a result, it's feasible that we as a collective may consider someone as not valuable (i.e. the person creates more risks/harm for the society than benefits/rewards) one day, and then 27 years later, consider the same person to be valuable.

philosophy,3cizy8,Logically_Insane,9,Thu Jul 9 23:27:06 2015 UTC,"I'll argue it's only within the practical application, and there are no specifically defined points.  Value can be described as the sum of social productivity minus social deviancy.  Relativism applies here, so no hard values can be ascribed, but what a society is willing to tolerate, aka ascribe value, from any given individual is simply a combination of those aspects in contrast to the ability of that society absorb deviant behaviour and to enforce social limits.    That said, things get more complex as some deviancies are relative to societal size and have a buffering effect... Say we have 2 people:  one abled and one disabled.  They are both leeches.  A small society would not be able to tolerate either, but a large one can.  However, in large societies the disabled person is often awarded welfare whereas the abled person may not be.  So overall many relative systems are in play to determine personal value.  Furthermore, common systems in developed societies with large social buffers break with relative systems for normalizing purposes, creating rules or laws that apply basic value to everyone.  In any system however you can both erode your value over time through acts that hurt society, or in some narrow cases you can lose all value instantly, especially in the case of large societies that have codified value.  I find the concept of minimum value attenuation due to societal size the more interesting concept here actually.  As a society gets larger they have the luxury of tolerating a lot of individual devaluation... We actually see this quite a lot... But why?

So we overvalue human life and security and fair(ish) treatment in the sense that we pay a cost in supporting aforementioned types of people (above, OP) having less relative societal value.  Whether this overvaluation leads humanity toward a 'better' system of ethics in some sense is debatable.  Or ambiguous, rather.

The definition of happiness I prefer is: a state of goal-directed effort that is expected to succeed.

Some competing definitions imply that one's level of happiness cannot be changed, in which case it isn't meaningful to discuss its value.  Love can be measured too, by mentally creating a list of who you would pull first from a burning building.

So in the house you have: sack of money, your mother, your father, your dog, your son, your daughter, your best friend, your spouse, a coworker, and a stranger. They are all unconscious, and you can only carry one at a time. Who gets picked up first? Who has to wait until after the money gets rescued?  The sack of money is more realistic than it sounds.

I believe that all human beings were all all born as innocent children, when they become evil they are only doing so as a retaliation towards an unfair world that treated them harshly, people are only evil because they have had a troubled past and they believe that the rest of the world is also evil and if they don't fight back they will be consumed. When I see a murderer I see a hurt child, when I see a thief I see a starving child, instead giving them the psychological help they need to become normal people we subject them to pain and torture because it makes everyone feel better in a sadistic way.

In fact, it's often portrayed as noble to sacrifice yourself if you're an elder that can do so to save someone younger, and even can be ignoble to not do so. Even if you're the president of the United States, and it's your life or an infant's, a bystander may think it cowardly for you to choose yourself.  So as a result, we have this idea of potential: the younger you are, the more wide-open your life is, the more likely you are to succeed or positively impact the world. If you're older, you've already contributed a certain amount, and have less remaining potential. If you're inherently a bad person, people WANT you to be less valuable than an infant. But on the flip side, if you're an inherently awesome person, even if you're the reason 5 million people have clean drinking water and a laptop, people EXPECT you to treat yourself as less valuable. This ties into the idea of humility: looking past current value and seeing potential value. But, basically, this means that no matter how you go about it, age is almost directly proportional to value. The fluctuations that occur because of morality are minor in the grand scheme of things, if we take life and death to be the most significant matters.

You can't sacrifice the general (king) to save a few soldiers (pawns) if you want to win the game.   Imagine looking at it from the outside perspective. If you had to choose, do you save a cancer researcher or a random person? The researcher already has proven value, but in the case of the random, you have to guess what might be likely. It's much riskier. The baby is like the random person--you don't know how much potential is there. So you shouldn't technically treat the baby differently. Do you take a huge risk, or stick with what option already has high utility and minimal risk?  That said, the ethics of self-sacrifice is puzzling, if you evaluate it from a utilitarian standpoint."

But there isn't, value can be created out of thin air and need never be in short supply, all you need is ... well, love as Lennon would say.

Is it though fair to expect a morally sound person to give up their time for someone who has wronged so severely? I guess that depends on whether said person sees reason for their behavior and a willingness to listen and be open to change.

Basically, from pondering how you put this, I've come with a few examples and conclusions.  Governments put a value on a human life, for example, the Value of an American killed in a foreign conflict is considered to be of higher value than a Foreign citizen being accidentally killed by a Drone strike.  Maybe I shouldn't say the word Government, but should instead say Leader, because the Leaders of some African tribes also put a value on their followers when they sold them into slavery.  Same thing goes for Heads of family, when they put a value on their Daughters life to be sold into marriage.  The big difference here is that everything is given a value by their respective leader, and none of these values are the same because obviously, they are all different situations and all have different outcomes.  We are given the gift of life (IMO) to learn and experience, and some choose to experience things that Leaders have deemed wrong, and thus give up their chance at more free experiences.  I cannot say its right or wrong to go against these laws or rules these Leaders have come up with, but in societies, either ones governed by Elected Officials, Blood Lines, or Usurped, basically deem you have value if you follow their norm (or laws, or village rules).  Those who do not follow their norm, are deemed less valuable, and can either be given the boot, arrested for violating laws, penalized or reformed, or ultimately, destroyed.    Is it wrong?  It just depends on how you look at it, in order for societies to function, there has to be some order, and if people feel like they can do whatever they want, its only a matter of time before others feel the same way, and then what are the purpose of the order if nobody follows it.  I think it ultimately comes down to what you think you are worth, and also if you think the person who made the rules deserves your worth."

The question isn't ""does a murderer still have value,"" but ""are we all better off as a society if we treat murderers as if they still have value?""  The first question is, to me, uninteresting.  It is something that different people would disagree on (hippies vs. the family of the victim, for example).  It's the sort of question that I believe has no concrete answer, and that could be argued indefinitely.  I believe there's a better chance for the second question of coming up with an answer or having a productive discussion with a satisfactory conclusion.  I was highly persuaded by Pinker's suggestion in Better Angels of Our Nature that one of the main forces for civilizing humans and putting us on the ever-downward trajectory for death by violence was when people started seeing other people as people and not objects (one example of this being the advent of mass printing allowing us to read other people's thoughts).  I believe that a society that says, ""yes, this person has taken a life, but we as a society declare that they still have value as a person and that we need only protect ourselves from them"" is a better society than one that says, ""this person took a life and is of absolutely no value to society.""

philosophy,3cizy8,ristoril,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:52:04 2015 UTC,"In my view the value of a person can be altered not intrinsically but relatively. Due to the ingrained perspectives of societal “norms” and what “we” perceive makes a functional society, we play by “rules” and when these “rules” are broken the individual is seen as diminishing the value of a given society thus independently decreasing his/her own value. It is solely due to the collective perspective as to what this individual’s value is or isn’t and this perspective is ultimately malleable, biased and inherently flawed. If someone murders for the benefit of society A he is considered a hero but at the cost of society B is considered a felon. Someone like a tyrant could be seen as costing a given society and his value ultimately diminished but could possibly be benefitting the country in some warped way that isn’t instantly recognisable at a given moment in time. Whether this is right or wrong is hard to categorise but it is what it is. looking at it from a way broader perspective each individual is part of a collective which, in turn is part of something bigger e.g the universe. The measure of an individual's judgment as such is based on such a minute spectrum of time, in the broader perspective ad infinitum all individuals equal the whole and each individual's value is the same, all the same. It’s only perspectives that change. Apologies if this is utter rubbish my brain just tried to vomit the thimble of a thought it was holding onto."

When it comes to criminlas i would argue that this has strongly to do with the values a society has written down in thier laws.  Lets for a moment assume all laws are actually perfectly written to be the same for everyone.   These laws are in a way a contract that said society has put down to make possible a civil and peacefull life within it's confines. If you break one of these laws you have broken the contract and are punished. Societys then punish according to what they feel aprobiate for the now as criminal designated person that broke the contract.  Now the reality is that these contracts are all over the place, people with more power can add their evaluation of the worth of a person or of a group of people and the circumstances that make a person betray the contracts are vastly manifold and diverse. There is no worth of a human beeing set in stone, neither if you put it down in writing or try to determine it via discussiomns as this.   This worth is totally fluctuating and different from person to person and even depends on the situation, it's circumstances, mood, upbringing and the question if the person making the evaluation in hier mind has had a good breakfast today.  For me personnally there is worth in every person, but the question, especially in consideration of a crime, is how long can i keep acting on my (current) value of a person when doing so would bring harm, emotional and/or physical in nature to another person.  There could also be the question how can we restore or better such a value given to a person based on it's actions?

From 'pleasure' is derived joy, safety, comfort, and leisure time.  For example, agriculture produces food that keeps many people alive, and mechanized agriculture produces a sufficient abundance that many people enjoy the safety of a secure food supply, and the leisure time to do something other than work on the farm.  We use money to compare the various contributions to this goal of ""remain alive and feeling good"". If we were immortal and could not be harmed, we would have no use for money or food, and the concept of value would be meaningless.  EDIT: And no, those basic questions are not ""part of the measurement procedure"". Those questions are a fundmental property of the concept of 'value'.

philosophy,3cizy8,eleitl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:32:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to put forth a view from metaphysics of some of the spiritual traditions. Value is a metaphysical concept. Physical things an and of themselves do not have value. Value is a judgement of the intellect. The intellect being a metaphysical concept as well, value is a quality of the intellect. David Bently Hart in his book, ""Atheist Delusions"", talked about the history of Rome. During the pre-Christian era, specifically in the cultural sphere defined by the pagan cults and mystery religions, value was something very physically defined. A slave, for instance, had no value. They were considered as faceless people before the law. Abusing them was seen as no different than abusing a rat. There was no connection between morality/piety and, say, charity, especially towards the most needy. And this attitude boils down to the concept of value. What made Christianity so attractive was the total reconfiguration of the conscious potential of the mind and attitudes and the way the world was seen and felt. Value was something now seen as inherent in people based on spiritual principles, which is universal.   When we're talking about legal pragmatism and the maintenance of rights, when a person does something that requires punishment, we can say it does not diminish their inherent value. However, they have oppressed themselves and acted against their innate valuable nature. And also, when taking into account what is required of a healthy society, certain sorts of measures must be taken."

The marijuana dealer now works for peanuts 4 days a week building machine parts.  The alcohol distributor (who started with a loan from his weathly grandpa) gets high in his giant house 3 days a week.  On Monday and Friday he goes in to board meetings.  He occassionally gives boring speeches at the local country club.  The marijuana dealer is a fairly good poet, but unpublished and completely unrecognized.  All jobs that ordinary humans currently do will eventually be automated as machine intelligence becomes increasingly more general.  What are the primary functions that you do in your job?  I am a computer programmer who has been studying leading edge advances in AI.  I bet that I could personally automate 60-70% of the tasks you perform in your job.  Then what would your 'value' be?  People are actually more like you than you know.  Everyone deserves to live and has value.  And if you understand technology then you will realize that we can in fact provide for everyone as long as people don't all decide to have several kids.

But like anything, whether it is the welfare slob or the career car jacker, one has to want to do more, needs to be able to identify their own flaws they need to work on to change themselves from their core.  A murderer with a violently aggressive personality deserves therapy, the humane application of psychiatric medication (not throwing pills at them until they cannot think), and opportunities to learn skills and position themselves to have a life they are proud of regardless of whether they ever get out of prison.    People living with dignity is crucial for a balanced society.  If the person refuses or rebels against help to help them calm down and learn to look at the world in a different light, then it just isn't their time for them to reestablish their value.

Are you using the word interchangeably with 'a human' or 'a guy/gal' (ie, fuzzily), or do you intend something more precise, to do with legal personhood? I'd recommend you stick to the latter, for clarity and to head off the ""but that's just a human construct"" type answers - anything to do with the value of persons is going to be a human construct, intersubjective, etc. So, let's use person with a capital 'P' to be sure.   Then 'value', another ontological bear trap - again, so long as you're not thinking of value like 'calories' or 'ergs' or 'ounces of gold', but have a properly intersubjective phenomenon in mind, we'll be fine.   Finally 'inherently' - like u/filosophikal I note this word feels like it's used in your question to pose, not a relationship between the two but an identity between them, more like a 'property', as in the wetness of water, something that's integral because physics. Value can't be like that, so I'd suggest the inherence you're looking for is more of the kind 'is personhood logically separable from value, or does our definition of personhood fundamentally involve value'?  Hopefully, by clarifying these terms, you then see that the following answers flow:  Why do we believe this?  To live as we do in our civilisation, it's necessary that our concept of personhood entails value.   To what extent will we ignore this belief, and under what circumstances?  In general, we ignore it when we are weak (eg, when we are not masters of our own behaviour but at the mercy of our emotions) or when consensus believes our civilisation to be under threat (justifying, eg, the massacres around Srebrenica in the eyes of many Serbs).   To the extent that US prison service fails to treat people as Persons, I think you're right to be concerned - the 'sanctity' of human life is reduced for all of you, not only the convicts. This is dehumanising to you all and laying the basis for a backward slide in your level of civilisation. If that's a direction of travel that bothers you, you should fight hard to re-establish decent treatment of convicts in the US justice system.

I do approach this as a social question, not one that attempts to transcend  human understanding, as I read that as how it was posed. 1.  The complex system that we can call humanity (society only being a small part), and the larger complex system that would be something like the workings of the universe, well their inner workings are just unknown to us.  But we can infer from what we do know of other systems we study that variation within system is needed.  So, roughly stated, almost any part of the system can be said to have similar value.  The violent criminal will be your best friend when we need to fight for our survival.  The sickle cell carrier will survive the malaria outbreak.  And yes, even those characteristics that we can't see what their value could possibly be can be assumed to have some value.  And I am still talking about real quantifiable type value.  With this in mind, we have to often say that, we understand the concept of complex systems and the need for variants, but we don't have the ability to model or predict the system well enough to claim any deep understanding.  So while we can't quantify the value, we can assume one does exist, even when we don't see it. 2.  Again, looking at the complexity of things, do we know that a person with apparently ""low value"" today won't have more value tomorrow?  Or if they have little value in one way, what value do they have in other ways?  This angle has been touched on by others.  So when we attempt to determine a person's value, are we talking about their immediate value?  The best answer would probably be no.  While the example was a murderer, I think the intent was broader, but in my reading it appeals to our wanting to ask about this person's value and how we should treat them.  So it should consider the long view. 3. This starts to sound a little spiritual, but I think of it in philosophical terms, but life is a unique thing. (primarily talking of conscious life, and more specifically the human version of it)  We all live it and therefore ado a mean-centering in our minds and arrive at a very low average value (zero actually, with positives and negatives) when it might be more accurate to NOT mean center it.  Then we have all life having value.  The value being the uniqueness of it, the accumulation of events and thoughts.  People have argued this back and forth for centuries, so I can't claim to have a hands down winning argument for the 'value of life', but it is definitely one that should be considered.  So when considering something like the death penalty, or when trying to place 'value' on a person, this component shouldn't be overlooked.  There are many comments on empathy, social contracts, legal/penal issues, and the difficulty in any type of valuation (be it relative or intrinsic), some of the very well thought out and informative.  But after reading much of it I conclude the following:  If you use the word value, you instantly open up the door for people to take it to a valueless discussion (meaning removing the meaning of value, not opinions with no value... although...).  But it is nonsense to pretend that we don't understand the question and its relevance.  Its easy to get drawn into sophism.  And I also conclude that there are many ways of seeing value.  Which kind of gets to the point that to take it away based on one way of thinking is not wise.  Maybe someone with more background can help me with this.  Is there a name for the argument where the exact positive conclusion is impossible to define, but the negative conclusion is nonsense?"
philosophy,3cizy8,danielmatlock,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:50:25 2015 UTC,"Nothing has inherent value absolutely. People are no exception. Now in an act utilitarian system, which societies like the US lean towards if accidentally so, the value of a thing or an act can be determined.  Moral relativism has less bearing here, in my opinion, than ethics do as morality is an internal system, something for an individual and their justifications for their actions. Ethics deal with others, the external, and as such we can look at it thusly:  It is ethical to assume all people have value by virtue that denying a person as having value is unethical.  The type of value and degree vary greatly from person to person and based on context, but it is fair (IMHO) to say that treating a person as if they have no value is unethical.  It is ethical to assume that the benefits to society of an action are more important than the benefits to an individual. This of course is on a sliding scale, but it is better for the whole class to have one cookie each than for only one of the students to have one cookie.   It is ethical to base the value of a person, in certain contexts, on their cost and benefit to society at large.  If a doctor invents a new treatment for Lupus he is a miracle worker. If another perfects prophase/anaphase  lock treatments and cures all cancers she is kind of a bigger deal.  Therefore it is ethical for a person who is a detriment to society, of great enough degree depending on context, to be treated as having no value- or more correctly negative value.  TL;DR it is an ethical act to segregate or even outright destroy something that is of sufficient detriment to a system, and thus 'every life is sacred' can be a true starting position and also be negated in certain circumstances.  Edit: word choice and autocorrect errors."

Most people will not read a book about philosophy; they prefer a simplistic world view over a more nuanced world view.  Until, for most people, the simplistic view begins to cost them personally; but they most likely will adopt a slightly different simplistic world view that pragmatically reduces their cost to an acceptable level.  Most will not seek out a deeper, more nuanced understanding of either themselves or their fellow human beings.  So I think this part of your posting is logically flawed.  ""Is there something wrong with the idea that a person can suddenly lose their consideration as a valuable human being""  As for this, well, the assumption is obvious in the last three words; Value is innate.  Value can be replaced with status, and you have a more pragmatic model for understanding the increase and decrease in value over someone's lifetime.  For societies, it is an individual's place in the social order that imparts status, and therefore value.    This appears to be true in other animal societies on our planet as well.  It also appears that animal societies have some kind of anteroom where strangers are greeted and evaluated.  Humans call this anteroom by several names; manners is one of them.  ""Do they deserve this?""  One last assumption to examine.  Let's flip the context on this.  Did Bill Gates 'deserve' all he's accomplished, or was it just luck and timing and the right place at the right time?  Consider the stories in the book ""Outliers:  The story of success"" by Malcolm Gladwell and the revisit your question.  You might find your question is altogether invalid."

""  Nope, physical and mental impairments can easily drop someone from a net benefit to a net burden. The disabled have it easy, in terms of societies wrath, because everyone wants to live in a society where they don't get mistreated if they're loose their legs or their mind, and its not the result of their (intentional) choices. Someone who can't function within the law is a liability because of their own choices. No one wants to hire someone today who might smack his wife around tonight and be in jail tomorrow, they're suddenly designated as replaceable because their record shows they'll probably need to be replaced on short notice, value plummets. Replaceable things are inherently less valuable. That's where over population comes in. Almost all of us are replaceable and the replacements are plentiful. Every additional human above some ideal amount isn't just less valuable because they're replaceable, they're undesirable because they're competition. Its a class size that's slightly bigger, a slightly longer checkout line, a slightly worse traffic jam, another resume on the stack above yours, a slightly longer wait at the emergency room. That's what you are to other people.  Obviously we see redeeming qualities in other humans too, but as soon as society pegs you as a net negative they're more then ready to blame you for everything. They don't really care if you get rehabilitated, they really just want you gone because society doesn't need you anyway. Don't have kids unless you're certain that you're in the top 10% bracket for potentially raising worthwhile humans.

Whats worse is that the ones who run this facilities are even more bad than the people they imprison, yet they profit off of the ignorant to fuck up and get locked up.   (philosophy thinking) ""Is a lazy person relying solely on undeserved welfare really and truly engaging in such a breach of decency that they ought to be considered as worthless by the whole of people who make honest livings?""    ~ I think its too difficult to draw the line in the sand for these people. But people on welfare are def. looked down upon because of the many who abuse that service. Basically, the many who abused welfare fucked it up for the few who actually truely need it. Nobody/noone will ever truely be able to tell whether or not a person on welfare deserves it or not. Besides, they make it too easy to get it. Have one kid, and dont get a job. Bam, you are going to get taken care of. Why? Because if the government helps you, you will help them. Through your voting, your opinions, and your support to fight in wars that are not actual wars, but illegal acts into other countries to steal that countries natural resources. Its all a manipulative game, and your are a simple observer(i.e. you have no power or control, just the illusion of it). So in conclusion, the lazy/fat/useless people who are on welfare are chameleons. You will not be able to distinguish them from the people who actually warrant welfare.  ""I have an extremely empathetic heart, and may be biased in my viewpoint on this, but I have an inkling that the general body of humanity harbors too little of qualities we'd like to consider as integral parts of ethics: forgiveness, mercy, compassion, empathy, and honor.

A person is a person, no matter his sin. Sin being used in context of other people, not in answer to God. A person who has made the greatest contribution to society is still only a person. Any person who does not have regard for human life  is also still a person, not some animal, and must be treated accordingly. To suggest that a person's actions can remove them from being seen as human is dangerous.  Any categorical difference between people will be used to compare and contrast, to tell what is better and what is not. We already struggle with removing negativity with gender, color, ethnicity, religion, and so on. Those differences are arbitrary. A person can live in the US or in Mexico and can be a good person. A person can strive toward Nirvana or Heaven and be a paragon.  Valuable is a tough word to ascribe to a human. By whose right, by whose standard will that value be judged. You say society, but society varies and offers no objective standard. Law is in place specifically because of the variation. It helps large groups of people, in the simplest of terms, deal with each other and ensure clear boundaries of their rights. Even then, laws vary from place to place and are based on society.  So to answer your question, to give people the right to judge another as worthwhile in society is a dangerous idea. We already saw where lynch mob mentalies lead people on social media. It can cause strong harm in ways that are hard to fix if it's unjustified. Law, the idea of it if not necessarily its current execution of it, unbiased, blind to origin and social status, and fair, should be the standard that people are judged on if they wrong another person. And let them be judged as a person, and let them know what standards it is to be a person, to rise to them. Otherwise people will just be judged on the subjective opinions of others, however right or wrong they may be."

In your examples, a person ""loses"" value not because he has no value, but because society decided that the person went below a certain threshold of value (I think of that threshold as 0, because it symbolizes how you've become of a negative value and must pay for your crime). This agrees both with relativism and the context bit that were brought in the comments, as those affect how much value a person starts with and define the rules by which a person gains and loses values in different frames of reference - for example, if a commits murder, society might view him of a negative value and want to sentence him for life / death sentence, whereas their family or friends might still see value in that person.

I think that makes it a very bad allegory, then, since the process by which objects cast shadows is causal and physical, whereas metaphysics, by definition, is not."

philosophy,3ch01y,wokeupabug,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:28:44 2015 UTC,"In the allegory, the shadows on the wall are cast by physical objects, which participate in causality.  Light + object = shadow, a process we examine and test via senses and reason.  However, the shadows are meant to be metaphoric for perceptions, with the objects being metaphysical Forms, and the light being, depending on the reading, Reason or God or suchlike.  Problem is, metaphysical Forms, by definition, do not participate in normal causality; they can't be examined via both the senses and reasoning about our sensory experiences, but instead only, and in fact only ostensibly, via pure capital-R Reason.  So Plato thus tells an allegory in which physical objects are made to stand in for metaphysical Forms that just don't participate in reality (or, I feel compelled to say, actually exist) in the way the physical objects do."
philosophy,3ch01y,eaturbrainz,2,Fri Jul 10 12:35:16 2015 UTC,"Metaphysical forms do participate in normal causality, the objects casting the shadows can't be examined with the senses, and you seem confused about what an allegory is--complaining that the allegory of the cave is a bad allegory because forms aren't the same things as objects casting shadows is like saying that Animal Farm is a bad allegory because pigs don't practice communism."

My problem is that people get so tied up with this idea that ""Plato states that reality is not as it immediately appears"" that they forgets what seems to me the larger point, which is the relationship between the prisoners inside the cave and the prisoner outside the cave, and how it illustrates both the difficulty and the necessity of maintaining a philosophical dialogue."

But I don't see how you're going to defend your interpretation.  Here's what Plato writes:   Finally, I suppose, he'd be able to see the sun, not images of it in water or some alien place, but the sun itself, in its own place, and be able to study it...  And at this point he would infer and conclude that the sun provides the seasons and the years, governs everything in the visible world, and is in some way the cause of all things that he used to see. (516b)   This surely is not radical skepticism he is describing.  And he connects the allegory explicitly with the metaphysics and epistemology of the previous book:   This whole image, Glaucon, must be fitted together with what we said before.  The visible realm should be likened to the prison dwelling, and the light of the fire inside it to the power of the sun.  And if you interpret the upward journey of the soul to the intelligible realm, you'll grasp what I hope to convey, since that is what you wanted to hear about...  In the knowable realm, the form of the good is the last thing to be seen, and it is reached only with difficulty.  Once one has seen it, however, one must conclude that it is the cause of all that is correct and beautiful in anything, that it produces both light and its source in the visible realm, and that in the intelligible realm it controls and provides truth and understanding, so that anyone who is to act sensibly in provate or public must see it. (517b)   This is clearly not radical skepticism, and it's clearly not just about primitive preconceptions."

It doesn't seem like a totally natural state of ignorance, what with the chains and the parade of statues and all. Once you get into the strict mechanisms that are obscuring our capacity to see truth, you are in the deep end of Platonic philosophy. That's a whole other post right there."

I admit I made kind of a jump to get to ""materialists,"" but I think to be so adamant that the idealism of the Allegory of the Cave is irrelevant to its greater message betrays a worldview that runs entirely counter to it, and suggests an attempt to retcon the ""classics"" to achieve consistency with their personal beliefs."

Certainly, there is a consistent skepticism about conveying such a glimpse in discursive language, otherwise than through uncertain analogies.  But even if we lean heavily toward skepticism about a vision of the forms, I still don't see that the point of the cave is to illustrate (an analogy to) evil demon skepticism.

A little ambiguous is an understatement for almost everything important in Plato:D Anyway, the entire allegory passage is full of language which leads me to question whether Plato even thought it was possible for a human to have direct knowledge of ideas.   I've seen a lot of discussion about this allegory devolve into the moral of ""don't try to change an idiot's mind,"" you can't, but Plato seems to be saying the exact opposite.    Well, as you note, the main character, Socrates, spent his days trying to change multiple idiots' minds so your reading is not all that far fetched."

philosophy,3ch01y,Nickyfyrre,5,Wed Jul 8 14:38:15 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this helps, but my sense has always been that you have to read the element of compulsion in the context of Plato's remarks concerning nature.  For him, natural change is always decline.  The perfect (or best possible) state is the one that is least likely to change because change is always decline.  That is, it goes through aristocracy to timocracy to democracy to tyranny. However, there has to be a kind of change that would not be decline, a change for the better as it were.  This change would be unnatural and hence experienced as compulsion.  This is the change that is education - which is why he starts the allegory by claiming that it is an image of education (or paideia).  The idea that education should emulate natural change (a modern pedagogical view) would be abhorrent to him.  For Plato, education feels like dragging us kicking and screaming.  It's only after we are educated that we see its value.  Just a thought."

I do remember this from back when I DID speak a little Greek, the language of descending back into the cave matches up pretty precisely with the opening lines of the Republic, ""Down I went to the Piraeus,"" which is where Socrates is headed when he gets hijacked into this long dialogue. Many, myself included, take this to me that the entire conversation in the Republic is intended as an attempt to ""liberate"" Glaucon and the other interlocutors in the same way the prisoner in the cave is ""let go.""

I also think one of the main points of the allegory is to explain, not that you can't change people's minds, but it cautions that it is difficult, that people are often afraid or skeptical of information that doesn't correspond to the way they've lived thus far. He discusses that people may want to retreat back to the familiarity of the cave, but that they mustn't if they are to progress philosophically.

The rest of the prisoners, it's said, when the freed prisoner returns to the cave, will mock the one with ""higher"" sorts of knowledge and think that he or she is crazy/dangerous/a problem for society (compare this with the accusation made against Socrates in the Apology). So, for the prisoners, the shadows they saw on the cave wall are all they know about reality: to them, there's no difference between perception and reality (this is also discussed in the Theaetetus).  However, the freed prisoner who has ventured out of the cave will not want to return once he or she has grown accustomed to the outside. Outside of the cave is where the ""really real"" things exist and in the cave the prisoners only have experience with imitations and shadows. So, for this person, the mere perception of shapes in the cave is not true knowledge of reality and, therefore, pointing out the patterns and shapes of the shadows on the cave wall seems less important.  That said, the shadows in the cave and everything else we perceive with our senses are still important and are still real. We run the risk of looking like fools chained to a wall in a cave if we think that the body of knowledge we've collected so far is all there is to know."
philosophy,3ch01y,conflatedsqualor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 14:09:58 2015 UTC,"I think that's roughly correct, and a fairly normal reading, but I don't think this is quite right:   Socrates goes onto say later in the same book of the Republic that he should go anyway, because its in line with his civic duty.   In 519, Socrates says that ""our job as founders"" is to compel the best to study philosophy, but then not allow them to remain in the sun instead of going back down to the prisoners to share in their labors and honors. Glaucon objects that it's unjust to force someone to live a worse life than possible, but Socrates reminds him that the concern of law is to harmonize and bind everyone in the city by persuasion and compulsion.  Socrates goes on to say that when philosophers appear in other cities, they grow up spontaneously, against the will of the city's regime, and so they don't owe their education to the city, and it's just for them not to want to serve anyone in the city.  Socrates is saying that the ideal city must train the best as philosophers, and then force them (probably by exactly the philosophical argument he is making here) to leave that better realm to govern among the rest of the citizens. I wouldn't really call this civic duty: I'd say it's acting according to the idea of the good, as embodied in the ideal city. But those who become philosophers in (existing) anti-ideal cities have no civic duty.  I love the use of language here, which constantly reminds us of other ideas in play. Words like ""compel"", ""not allow"", and ""persuade"" keep appearing, as echos and metaphors for Socrates' dialectic compelling listeners to see truths they didn't see before. Socrates of course ""reminds"" Glaucon about the concern of the law, because for Plato learning is remembering. It's just for the philosopher-founders of the ideal city to compel future philosopher-governors to govern rather than enjoying philosophy all the time, and also just for the self-taught philosopher in the existing city to refuse to serve."

To me, the point of the argument is that ANYONE who experiences a philosophical awakening owes that awakening in part to their philosophical fore-bearers in the city,  and the cultural grounds that allow that philosophical awakening to flourish. In other words, Socrates is ""founding"" an ideal inside of Glaucon that will drive him to a more free and virtuous conception of reality, but reminding Glaucon that he can't then turn around and abandon his responsibilities to Athens. Just as Socrates is compelling Glaucon to evolve philosophically, Glaucon must in turn carry on the work (and Adeimantus, and of course, Plato, who isn't present in this conversation but clearly thinks of this as part of the entire enterprise he's performing). Admittedly, I base much of this interpretation from another dialogue, the one with Crito, which is where Socrates claims he can't abandon Athens even if it means saving his life, because that would be like disrespecting his own father. I take this to mean, at least in part, that Socrates gives the Athenian polity a lot of the credit for his identity as a philosopher, and does not consider himself, ""self-made,"" in any sense. So all real philosophers are in the situation of the second-generation of citizens in the Republic, not the founders."
philosophy,3ch01y,conflatedsqualor,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:29:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure Plato was really a fan of Athens, with its democracy and especially for killing Socrates, so I'm doubtful that Plato would unconditionally endorse civic duty.  The comparison with Crito is interesting. In Crito, Socates gives many reasons for not fleeing. The foremost, I think, is that Socrates loves Athens. But he does also talk of consequences and say that the city must be obeyed like a father. Since Plato evidently loved Socrates, maybe he would follow him in endorsing civic duty!  But there is a way to read the two books as not conflicting. In Crito, the emphasis is on the unjust harm inflicted on the city by active disobedience. In The Republic, the emphasis is on a positive contribution to the city by philosophers, which would be ""compelled"" in the ideal city, but not required of the self-educated in the unphilosophical city.   I think you right about Socrates' thoughts and feelings about himself and Athens. I also think Plato may not have felt the same."
philosophy,3ch01y,conflatedsqualor,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"That sounds right to me. Its certainly true historically that Plato didn't stick around Athens once he grew up. My philosophy teachers always sort of implied that Plato's early work does double duty insofar as it both presents Plato's earliest philosophical ideas and attempts to exonerate Socrates from the more spurious claims leveled at him by his critics. Those two goals were perhaps less and less compatible as his philosophy matured, which would explain why Plato shifts to different interlocutors and avatars in a lot of his later work.  I think the Republic is closer to his early work than his late work, but its definitely not one of the very first dialogues, so it makes sense you might get some disconnect between what Socrates says and what Plato's attitude towards democracy turns out to be."

I feel like Singer's ideas are great and everyone should be instilled with a sense of altruism, but those ideas also feel a bit naive and somewhat removed from practicality or reality. I also feel like one can deductively reason that they imply that the solution lies with common folks giving up more when the middle class is arguably evaporating and there is quite a bit of evidence that a great deal of suffering and poverty stems from unchecked corporate profiteering and the rich systematically exploiting others.

philosophy,3cfkc2,firo_sephfiro,6,Wed Jul 8 03:19:15 2015 UTC,"Well the effective altruist community has become more aware of these issues and begun to address them a bit more recently; the problem is that it's really difficult to measure and understand advocacy efforts in terms of efficacy. You can easily tell what kind of health interventions save lots of people's lives, but you can't easily tell what kind of political efforts are most likely to change national economic policies. Also, while the payoffs are potentially great, it usually takes huge amounts of money in politics to make meaningful change, so it's complicated and unclear whether it's actually a more effective use of money. I think the Open Philanthropy Project is addressing this question - very recent stuff, so not too much research is out there yet. There's other examples too; Oxfam is a commonly recommended charity, and they do plenty of political advocacy work. My altruist friend was a volunteer for Academics Stand Against Poverty. Etc, etc. So you're right that most altruists are mostly concerned about directly alleviating global poverty, but it would be a mistake to identify Singer's arguments exclusively with direct aid. A lot of altruists (including Singer!) actually believe that vegan advocacy and artificial intelligence research are more important things to donate to and that poverty alleviation is more of a topic to get new people acquainted with altruist ideas and philosophy.

The idea that we have to do the absolute most good possible until we are in an equal position to those suffering.  I think in order to buy into this argument, you have to accept utilitarianism as completely true. And there are quite a few bullets to bite in that ideology.  Before long you're throwing 15 year old kids in front of trains to save the life of 14 year old kids etc.   I think it's hard to deny that altruism is an incredibly noble pursuit, though I would deny that it's impermissible not to perform altruistic acts unless the good far outweighed the cost. A bit frustrating we can't figure out where to draw that line, but it certainly isn't located at the polar extreme of reducing myself to the status of a starving african child ."

But whist Singer argues for it, I don't think effective altruism as a whole necessarily does - rather that, when doing good, one should consider the counterfactual ""what better things could I be doing with these resources?""  The effective altruists I know aren't necessarily poor, could definitely be giving MORE to charity, be doing MORE to help others - the point isn't that they are perfect, but that they recognise the imperfections and the nobility of striving to be as altruistic as they can.  Also, whilst singer is definitely utilitarian, not all effective altruists are - effective altruism is just trying to do the most good, whatever your definition of 'good' is."

What I'm asking is, how long does this take in the real world to happen if we as a society over time seriously accept Utilitarianism? It would take a long time before we get to a point that we're making decisions between 15-year-olds in front of trains and 14-year-olds in front of trains. The income gap, for example, is immense or so would the consequences be if we got rid of it, gradually or immediately. Pulling this extreme example out (which is in want of an actual practical context we can imagine where the choice is real), and especially prefacing it with ""before long,"" is so unfair to Utilitarianism, but then so are most of the ""bullets"" there are to bite.  Most of us have no problem when in fiction or otherwise a person sacrifices adults for children. If you think the line between 15 and 14 years old is ethically relevant, then your contention in throwing any of them in front of trains is arbitrary. The idea of throwing them in front of trains is going to elicit similar emotions to throwing adults in front of trains to save children (or throwing one child in front of a train to save millions of children). In reality, sacrificing people is rarely so goofy and our intuitions about a goofy case, tenuous in its practical applicability and definitely not representative of the norm (and furthermore hard to detach from how those situations tend to have loads of indirect consequences in real life), are hardly the most reliable intuitions. It's an emotional appeal and excuse my tone because I resent it."

philosophy,3cfkc2,meh100,5,Wed Jul 8 01:22:08 2015 UTC,"It's interesting that you consider this example a bad argument, because I got it out of Practical Ethics by Peter Singer.   If we favour the total view rather than the prior existence view, then we have to take account of the probability that when the death of a disabled infant will lead to the birth of another infant with better prospects for a happy life, the total amount of happiness will be greater if the disabled infant is killed. The loss of happy life for the first infant is outweighed by the gain of a happier life for the second. Therefore, if killing the haemophiliac infant has no adverse effect on others, it would, according to the total view, be right to kill him.  The total view treats infants as replaceable, in much the same way as it treats animals that are not self-aware as replaceable (as we saw in Chapter 5). Many will think that the replaceability argument cannot be applied to human infants. The direct killing of even the most hopelessly disabled infant is still officially regarded as murder. How then could the killing of infants with far less serious problems, like haemophilia, be accepted? Yet on further reflection, the implications of the replaceability argument do not seem quite so bizarre. (Practical Ethics, 3rd ed., p. 163)"

It's exceedling difficult to imagine that scenario (when I do it I imagine magic is involved, or God). I find it hard to believe most people don't fail at this step when they find Utilitarianism unfavorable. What's the point of examining intutions to examples like these the examples are so tenuous and flimsy that we can't even be sure people are thinking about them as thouroughly as they take themselves to? These examples have the opposite effect for me than they are intended to: when people find them unacceptable, I just assume they didn't see through the example; and when they do find them acceptable, I assume they did see through the example. I don't think the examples make or break a Utilitarian. I believe a Utilitarian is made before they ever get to extreme, flimsy examples like these and when they do get to them, they just see them as extreme examples of what they've already accepted.

He's pointing out to you that you must believe one of several things:   Utilitarianism is true, and euthanizing infants maximizes utility (and therefore is permissible) Utilitarianism is true, and euthanizing infants does not maximize utility Utilitarianism is the right moral system in many cases, except it doesn't apply when we are talking about certain issues like euthanizing infants Utilitarianism is false   If you abandon the 2nd position then you probably have to pick one of the others (there may be more possibilities I suppose). The fourth one is admitting defeat; the third one is bulky, unappealing and may force you to give up moral realism, which is a bit hard for those of us who like telling other people that they are obligated to do this or that with their time and money. But you can certainly accept it; a lot of people do.  So you have to realize that it is a problem to be reckoned with. Generally speaking, the mere fact that many people feel really aversive to killing babies doesn't make utilitarianism wrong. It's just points out that we have strong feelings which can contradict utilitarianism, so the utilitarian must reject that those feelings are normatively correct. And for some people the strength of their baby-preserving intuitions will constitute a strong reason to believe that there's more to ethics than just experiences and preferences."
philosophy,3cfkc2,UmamiSalami,4,Wed Jul 8 02:14:25 2015 UTC,"The problem-- the severe, back-breaking problem-- is that people think they're having intuitions about a case but are having those intuitions about another case.

What am I to believe, that people understand Utilitarianism and even accept the applicability of Utilitarianism to most cases, but fot some reason that breaks down in the ""extreme"" cases? Or that people just aren't getting the examples?  What even is an ""extreme"" example? Think about it, they're just the same as  ormal examples except more bare bones. Instead of talking about adults vs. children we're talking about 15-year-olds vs. 14-year-olds. How could there possibly be a break down of Utilitarian when we make this simple transition. I know! Because in the real world there are many variables that go into overall utility and the importance of the divide between adults and children is in many cases reliably and discernably more important than other factors to utility; while the divide between 15-year-olds and 14-year-olds is so minimal that in the real world a gazillion other factors are usually more important (which child is healthier, which child is better to other people, which chikd takes less risk, which child is more likely to be happy, which child is more likely to be successful-- I have barely scratched the surface) and simply telling people to ""imagine these variables are not present because the two children are identical in every way but age"" is not enough to have faith in our intuitions about this case.

philosophy,3cfkc2,meh100,2,Wed Jul 8 02:33:59 2015 UTC,"So forget trains. I think you are getting confused.  If a car is about to hit a little girl, is it impermissible not to push the nearest 50 year old man in front of the car assuming this will save the girl?  Again, these sorts of situations happen millions of times a day (a poor person who wants a TV, who is now entitled to steal, a doctor who can violently kill an old man to save 2 children) And these are just the basic issues.  What about if someone just really likes hurting children? What if his happiness from committing this act is so great, that it overshadows the childrens desire to not feel pain?  I understand you are very emotionally connected to this philosophy, but there's been 100+ years of incredibly thoughtful criticisms to classic utilitarianism that you simply haven't acknowledged.   Honestly, outside of the vegan philosophical realm, it's not taken seriously by anyone anymore, the criticisms of it over the years are just too substantial."
philosophy,3cfkc2,jimzbond,3,Wed Jul 8 12:46:27 2015 UTC,"Why do you keep putting ""impermissible"" in italics. Utilitarianism is very open to changes in variables - every variable matters - so it s hard to say what should be done unless a complete picture is had. In the example you gave, there are plenty of conceivable indirect consequences that might make the act of pushing the 50yo man in front of tbe car lsss than Utilitarian. Now you can say ""just imagine no e of those consequencss are present"" but that's hardly better than just saying ""imagine the scenario is Utilitarian."" It's hard to imagine that the situation is Utilitarian and ai imagine that is why people find it so unfaborable. Convince me that is not what is going on here.  Reading your other examples, which you are just so sure of, I'm not so sure you understand how many variables Utilitarianism takes into account. Utilitarianism might very well say that it is not okay for a poor man to steal a tv because it causes  haos or wanton disregard of lroperty or because poor people can g be trusted to know whag to take to efficiently reduce the wealth gap or etc. etc.   Can the happiness of a man really overshadow torture to not one but two boys?

philosophy,3cfkc2,meh100,2,Wed Jul 8 13:05:06 2015 UTC,"But you can understand given cases, and you can have certainty in the outcomes, and yet you can still find these issues problematic.

If you can abandon them, and say ""yes I think it's possibly okay to euthanize babies depending on this or that and whether it is feasible etc"" - then you've passed the test. However, to make the theory seem broadly true, pragmatically you need to persuade other people why their intuitions are faulty or incoherent (why are they there if they're not rational appraisals of moral value), while rationally you have to explain why and how we know that those intuitions are misplaced and irrational. Which are both possible tasks, I think. So I don't think many of these arguments based on intuition and shock value are very damning - least of all after-birth abortion done by the parents, which hardly bothers me from an emotional point of view (I'm twisted or something, I don't know). But there is a definite tension which needs to be overcome between what people feel is right and what maximizes utility."

The income gap is precisely the problem with hard line utiliatarianism.  If my neighbor has 101 dollars, and I have 99 dollars, all things being equal, it would be impermissible not to steal his money by force, (even to the point of hurting him if he resists) with no respect for his rights (there are no rights in utilitarianism). He will get less enjoyment out of his ""extra money"" than I will from a respectively larger increase in my standard of living ( my 100/99 > his 100/101)  This is what the pure utilitarian claims is right, either bite that bullet, or get a new philosophy.

philosophy,3cfkc2,meh100,-1,Wed Jul 8 12:43:56 2015 UTC,"yes it does... classic utilitarianism is an egalitarian philosophy.  The classic utilitarian stance is that if utility can be maximized for everyone, it is obligatory (not permissible, obligatory) to do so.  Someone with 99 dollars gains more utility from having an additional 1 dollar (a greater increase in wealth), than someone with 101 dollars loses from losing 1 dollar (a lesser decrease in wealth).   If you don't believe this, it isn't classic utilitarianism. It is possible you hold a mixed philosophy in this regard, I do as well. I believe rights violations may in fact be justified in certain extreme instances, but luckily we don't need to draw this line to reject hard line classic utilitarian ideology."

There is not a 1:1 correlation between utility and anything besides happiness, absence of pain etc. Those things do not depend necessarily on equality between people, especially not of dollars.  Looking at a situation where someone has more money than another person is a very narrow scope and Utilitarianism cares about a lot more things, such as what can be done with the dollars. Even if the classic economic principle of dimknishing returns is true, you can't just look at people's wealth and any inequality therein to detertime how much utility they have. This is a basic mistake. Utility is not money."
philosophy,3cfkc2,meh100,0,Wed Jul 8 15:34:25 2015 UTC,"It is the very definition of utility. It is literally your ability to live in a house, buy medicine, feed your family and yourself.   But just for fun, let's assume what you say is true (it isn't, and almost all utilitarian scholars believe in some form of egalitarian wealth redistribution).   Let's say person A and person B have vastly different needs and wants. Say person A (an ascetic) values his 50 dollar salary as much as person B values his 150 dollar salary (a man who enjoys lavish things). They both currently have 100 dollar salaries.   We now have a situation, where it is obligatory, to take 50 dollars from person A's salary by force, and give it to person B... Thus leaving them with the same amount of utility (B's $150=A's $50). Try as he might, the utilitarian cannot escape the absurdity of such a situation.   Add more people, add a whole society even, and we simply will have a series of absurd wealth confiscations with a complete disregard for personal rights.  Nevermind that enforcing such an idea is impossible, I think that in and of itself, it is intuitively unethical to most people that it is obligatory to have money stolen from them until they are at the point of marginal utility, in order to give it to someone else. I think in my example, person A is equally deserving of his income as person B, but utilitarianism demands we confiscate half his income and give to someone who will be derive greater utility from it.  I think the main issue of utilitarianism, is that it ignores the rights based approach to morality completely. I think a happy medium includes a balance of both consequentialist and deontological approaches, as appears when both philosophies are tested."

That's just not true about the Utilitariqn.  You're talking about diminishing returns again.I understand the principle. Utilitarian doesnot ingore rights, becausenUtilitarianism cares about such things as the laws' effect on people, so sometimes it is Utilitarian to grant people ""rights.""Sometimes ""rights"" are instrumentally goodnfor utility. That is why I as a Utilitarian have no problem when governments and people talk about the importance ofnthe right to free speech, freedom etc. They serve a purpose to Utilitarianism too.  I don't know how you can say a person ""deserves"" to have something that deprives the world of overall utility. You're invoking something like a right to make money and keep it, which a Utilitarian very well may want to keep because they think people are better off if those rights arenin the background. Maybe you just think that the free market sustem exists in a Utilitarian society. Whatever. A Utilitarian won't begrudge you that.  But no way does a person judt ""deserve"" to have something that robs the world of overall utility. No action you can take, and that includes making something or inventing something or providing a servicenor starting a business, makes it okay that the overall utlity in the world is less.

You sort of just stipulated that thr situation creates positive utility, so yes, Utilitarianism permits it so long as the people making decisions in the scenario (the homeless their I guess) can't decide something that creates even more utility (which is a good reason this example is bad because it's hard to believe this homeless theif is reallyncreating a Utilitarian outcome). If you want to bring the government into this by considering whether lawmakers should allow these sorts of actions, you open up a whole new csn of worms Utilitarianism-wise because now we have to consider whrther the effect of the law is Utilitarian, which means it's not enough to know that the homeless theif is creating positive utility).

Positive ""Human rights"" aren't absolute, ""good health"" and your ""human rights"" to have free healthcare or whatever is laughable for people starving in the desert, so when other people have less than you, you need to give it.

Healthcare versus people starving is a good point, and there is a point in life I think where expensive healthcare for little gain should probably be foregone in order to redirect the money, unless you have a very high income and prolonging your life will ""pay off"" more in the long run. But, thinking of my own poor ass here, if the doc was like ""look here is this 40% chance of saving you surgery, it'll cost you $15,000"" and i have $20k, even at my young age I feelnit would be more ethical to just try to get by without it, and die when I die, and keep giving in the meantime. So you're not totally wrong.  But it is still totally sensible to me to feed myself enough to be at good health and clean my wounds etc to stay alive, if only because my continued life means I can continue to give into the future, whereas if I die needlessly, who knows if any others after me will be as ethical. It's the same reasoning as above if you have a high income or level of power. A certain amount of self care will actually increase the giver's long term impact because they will maximize their chance of leading a productive life.

However I don't think it's impermissble not to do so, because I reject utilitarianism as a ""complete"" philosophy. The basic example of ""it's wrong to chloroform a guy off the street, kill him, and take his organs, to save the lives of two people"" is fairly difficult to argue against. Or to go with the extreme example, ""It's wrong to push a 15 year old in front of a train to save the life of a 14 year old (who will benefit from a year of added life = increasing total utility)"". At some point you have to acknowledge rights.   Basically the issue with classical orthodox utilitarianism, is that it has no way of adjudicating between the rights based scenarios, and it's own. I find utilitarianism and it's over-arching theme of consequentialism an incredibly useful part of the moral equation, but with no ability to compromise or adjudicate with other equally valid moral value claims, it runs into some very problematic situations, very fast."

The basic example of ""it's wrong to chloroform a guy off the street, kill him, and take his organs, to save the lives of two people"" is fairly difficult to argue against. Or to go with the extreme example, ""It's wrong to push a 15 year old in front of a train to save the life of a 14 year old (who will benefit from a year of added life = increasing total utility)"".    I don't see how, even granting the implausibility of the scenarios.   Basically the issue with classical orthodox utilitarianism, is that it has no way of adjudicating between the rights based scenarios, and it's own.    No, again, orthodox utilitarianism says you should always do what is utilitarian. That is a very straightforward way of doing things. This problem only arises if you decide to regard moral theories as ""sometimes useful"" in which case you do end up with problems such as this.   I find utilitarianism and it's over-arching theme of consequentialism an incredibly useful part of the moral equation,    What exactly does that even mean? Useful for what? Do you get to pick and choose what kind of morality is important?"

philosophy,3cfkc2,jimzbond,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:27:33 2015 UTC,"Famine Affluence and Morality - Singer 1972, there are some other essays I read where makes a similar claim but theres one since I'm at work.   Okay, but that was forty-three years ago, and it was a simplistic argument. I'm sure he would take into account issues of personal effectiveness based on the provision of certain goods. The prior point, that ""A utilitarian wouldn't starve themselves. They would give themselves what they need for good health, eg meet their own human rights, and give everything else they have in time and in goods to others,"" still stands because that is what maximizes global utility. If a utilitarian didn't do the above things then they wouldn't earn as much money.   So you are saying both proposed scenarios are okay with you? Seems incorrect.    Well to me it seems incorrect that you would allow greater numbers of people to die simply because some causal chains are more appealing to you than others. Generally speaking when we have these issues, the source of the wrongful-seemingness is simply suffering and death. The mind's intuitive sense doesn't make sense of numbers and tradeoffs very well at all. However, it sees the idea of suffering and death, and reacts negatively. So even though it's not being logical, it's reacting fundamentally to the same value theory which underlies utilitarianism.   My neighbor has 3 bmw's... no way this guy uses all 3... can I just take one from him?   If you can figure out who best needs cars, not getting arrested and explain away loss aversion and crime externalities etc and all those pragmatic issues, then sure, but you'd actually be obligated to sell it to raise money for some worthwhile cause.   I think the concept of ""ethical intutionism"" provides an interesting solution. Basically the idea is that every normative theory of ethics is applicable in certain situations... For example, you probably don't have to respect someones property right to their door, if by kicking it down you can save a hundred people inside a burning building. Similarly, it seems wrong to say that there are no such things as rights at all, for example, kidnapping a boy and harvesting his organs to save my two kids etc...   Well my problem with it is if mental processes are physically determined then moral facts can't play a role in the intuitive process, in which case our intuitions are entirely arbitrary/evolutionary and provide no good reason to act in certain ways. Besides, different people with different personalities or different backgrounds will have different intuitions in the same situation. How exactly can you differentiate between right intuitions and wrong intuitions without appealing to other moral ideas?   An example of a widespread ethical intuition would be ""suffering is worse than pleasure""... or ""it is wrong to punish someone for a crime they didn't commit"". Notice that neither of these are attributable to reason, or sense perception... their source/origin is intuitive.   Suffering being worse than pleasure is entirely attributable to sense perception. Suffering is a mental state which is perceived negatively and causes one to seek to avoid it. That's just what suffering is. So people can make legitimate value-claims about their own mental states being good or bad because they have direct sensory perception of their mental states being good or bad to them.   We didn't look at everyone experiencing pleasure and objectively come to the conclusion that it is better than pain.    We know from personal acquaintance with these mental states that pleasure and pain have certain features (behavior, causes, etc). When we observe those features in others, it is rational to assume that their pleasure and pain are probably similar to our own pleasure and pain. Therefore, if our pleasure and pain are good and bad, then theirs must also be good or bad to the same degree - because the features upon which pleasure's goodness supervenes are equally present in others. And this works because when people judge their mental states as good or bad, they don't merely make a behavioral analysis of what's causing them to act or feel a certain way. People put normative content into their feelings of ""this feels good"" or ""this feels bad"".    Similarly we didn't look at every single person who was locked up wrongfully and come to an empirical conclusion that that each case was in fact, wrong. We ""see"" they are valid through our sense of intuition, without reasoning.    Why not? Can't you judge that each person did not commit a proportional crime, that the sentence was made without fair trial, etc.? Couldn't we hypothetically program an intelligent computer with no intuitions or intentionality, which when given certain inputs about someone's actions and crimes could then calculate what sort of sentence would be unfair or unreasonable? Is there any case of this where intuition gives us a judgement which is not also provided by reason?   What you see as intuition here isn't a spooky phenomenon. It's what humans always do and have evolved to do in all sorts of things besides morality: we make abbreviated, quick mental judgements. We see a car with certain features and assume that it was made in a certain era, without having to stop and think about exactly which features make it appear so. We use heuristics.    Give this a read if and when you have the chance and are interested[1]    I will have to give it a look when I have the time. I am always interesting in reading into metaethics."

philosophy,3cfkc2,optimister,11,Tue Jul 7 21:25:39 2015 UTC,"I've read him to state otherwise in several essays... that we should give until ""marginal utility"" is about to be reached.  ""One possibility, which has already been mentioned, is that we ought to give until we reach the level of marginal utility - that is, the level at which, by giving more, I would cause as much suffering to myself or my dependents as I would relieve by my gift. This would mean, of course, that one would reduce oneself to very near the material circumstances of a Bengali refugee. It will be recalled that earlier I put forward both a strong and a moderate version of the principle of preventing bad occurrences. The strong version, which required us to prevent bad things from happening unless in doing so we would be sacrificing something of comparable moral significance, does seem to require reducing ourselves to the level of marginal utility. I should also say that the strong version seems to me to be the correct one."" - Singer, Famine Affluence and Morality 1972   Even his post script 20 years later, he claims the ""strong principle"" stands in his mind.  Edit: I have found some of his arguments about animal cruelty pretty convincing in spirit without having to go hard-line utilitarian. I believe there's a modest line to be drawn with consequentialist thinking (ie: you can't push someone in front a speeding train to save a slightly younger person, but you can probably push someone to save 10,000 people, although again, frustrating as to where to draw that line)  Actually he's one of the few philosophers who has made me change some my actual behavior in real life."
philosophy,3cfkc2,jimzbond,6,Tue Jul 7 21:58:29 2015 UTC,"Well I guess Singer needs to get his story straight then, because he also acknowledges that the,   fundamental principle of equal consideration is compatible with a great deal of inequality. Economists have long maintained that allowing the market to provide incentives for people to produce cheaper and better goods and services is the best way to raise the welfare of all, including the poor. If that is correct, and if the poor want a reasonable level of prosperity more than they want to have an income that is no less than anyone else’s, then giving equal consideration to the interests of the poor will require us to allow the talented to become rich.

philosophy,3cfkc2,jimzbond,2,Wed Jul 8 11:02:03 2015 UTC,"My thinking has always been related to maximally good worlds, not just maximally good actions, because the maximally good world produces more good than simply good actions in a less perfect world. This, I think, fits in with a type of contractarianism, where ideally we want this maximally good world, and our duties are to strive for it--we want to be, in this sense, ethical. Anyone who does not acknowledge and seek this end goal (as a general point, not in its particulars necessarily) is literally choosing to be outside of the moral community.  We can judge one's ethics by comparison to cultural expectations--one should do more good than is considered normal, and these examples and other structural-changing efforts will bring up the cultural expectation. So, if you do the most good possible, you're a saint, if not, you're still doing your job if you do enough good. I can praise you with degrees of intensity.  Note, though, that this system produces a continual upward pull, and if effective in this manner as it pulls social expectations, there will be no starving children for you to reduce yourself to."

Besides, I would argue that lack of charitable donation is a major structural cause of poverty. If the number of people required to create this structural change all became altruists significant progress would be made. And that's leaving aside the issue of what these 'structural forces' are. Some would say that free markets are responsible, others would say free markets are the solution. If these people both act to fix the structural forces, the net impact will be zero.

I also think it's worthwhile to consider whether your line of thought contains a bit of a slippery slip argument.  The argument looks like this:   If effective altruism requires you to help others, then effective altruism requires some degree of personal sacrifice. So, maximally helping others requires maximal personal sacrifice. Maximal personal sacrifice isn't worthwhile. So effective altruism isn't worthwhile.   But I don't think this inference is warranted.  For one, effective altruism doesn't seem to demand maximal personal sacrifice, and so wouldn't demand helping others to that degree. More charitably, it demands personal sacrifice to a reasonable degree, which would likely not entail impoverishing yourself.  Moreover, maximally helping someone might not even require maximal personal sacrifice anyways.  The most you can do to help someone might be to do exactly what this Princeton graduate has done: donate enough so that you can impact others' lives in the most essential ways, raising the world's standard of living while still preserving yours.  Those who make more than they need can afford to give more, and should (""need,"" in the charitable and reasonable sense of the word, not the sense implying self-impoverishment)."

Using the actual examples he gives, the lessons are either wrong, misleading or useless. Consider the example of the student who became a high-income hedge fund manager with the excuse that it would enable him to donate more money, and combine that with your own conclusion that there is no obligation to actually donate a painful amount of your income.   It promotes a number of totally false ideas; failing to consider the moral effects of where income is derived from and the effects of being beholden to that system, that ""charitable giving"" is the best course of action for accomplishing social progress, and now you also agree that living a luxurious life isn't even grounds for criticism, since you can hide behind some excuse that you are donating more than you otherwise would.

Or you could realize that by reducing your options to a meaningless dichotomy like that, you're part of the problem.    Well, you'd save a lot of people's lives. If a fireman saved your wife and kids from a burning building, you probably wouldn't spit in his face and charge that he wasn't accomplishing anything to change the world.

philosophy,3cfkc2,fencerman,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"Yes, really - the ""scorecard"" approach of ""but I saved X lives"" is too short sighted to be taken seriously. One slaveowner could put his money towards saving lives too. It's more complicated than that.    Well if a slaveowner actually saved people from dying and gave them lives that were well worth living, then yes it would be a good thing. Long run effects of poverty alleviation are positive, so whether you look short term or long term you're still making the world better.   Yes, and it was a failure at apologetics then too, and a deep misunderstanding on your part if you think my argument is defending consumerism.    Well like I said before, possessing non-tattered clothes and other possessions can effectively increase one's ability to participate effectively in society and have a productive career. That's basically the end of it.   Or you could realize that by reducing your options to a meaningless dichotomy like that, you're part of the problem.    You framed the issue as a drop-in-the-bucket argument, so I was only responding to that specific statement.   That's such an utterly wrong understanding of the point that it hurts.    Then what is the point? I'm afraid that if my analogy missed the point, then you are the one really missing the point, because as long as it's right to save people from a burning building, then it's right to save people from starvation, and that's all that Professor Singer needs to make his argument."

When you don't consider the systemic context an action occurs in, you get wrong analysis in many complex situations.  Here's a famous one:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equation  If you didn't consider the system you would conclude that saving a prey animal maximized utility for prey animals; because after all, that act would be everything to the particular animal being saved.  But we see by these equations that when we look to the systemic consequences, the long-term balance hasn't been changed at all.  In our current system, donating to charity is akin to saving a prey animal.  The act is everything to the person you save, but does nothing to change the equilibrium of the system.  If nobody gave to charity, social problems would need to be addressed through other means.  Perhaps all charitable donations do is put a bandaid on pressing social problems, the institutional causes of which might otherwise be addressed.  If you feel the problem is inequality then a far better solution than depending on individuals to decide to personally donate would be to tax everyone and deal with the problem systemically.  Depending on individuals to do it runs into the free-rider problem."

I simply haven't seen a good reason to believe that there are significant group harms arising from these sorts of things.   The act is everything to the person you save, but does nothing to change the equilibrium of the system.   Except the economy and the ecosystem are two wildly different things that you can't compare like this. There isn't a fixed equilibrium number of starving people in the world, there is just a lot of poverty which is slowly being eradicated.   If nobody gave to charity, social problems would need to be addressed through other means.    I see no reason to believe this - the amount of charity given now is nevertheless a drop in the bucket compared to the scale of global social problems, while foreign aid does exist but is very little anyway. These issues will always be inelastic to some degree: it seems entirely unlikely that reducing charity donations by $X will increase government aid by $X or more. Moreover, government spending on foreign aid has a poor track record.   If you feel the problem is inequality then a far better solution than depending on individuals to decide to personally donate would be to tax everyone and deal with the problem systemically.

Your approach is silly because you seem to care more about ""free rides"" than about actually solving problems.   You don't understand; the reason I care about the free-rider problem (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_rider_problem) is because if you don't care about it then you design systems which don't work.  Depending on individuals to solve social problem through personal donations is the same as depending on individuals to fund governments by voluntarily paying taxes.  The consequence in both cases is chronic and predictable under-funding.  I have a hard time understanding how you can fail to understand this, since there is abundant data.  It isn't as though people have just started donating to charities, charitable donations have been a hallmark of both the capitalist and feudalistic systems as far back as they go.  Both systems are characterized by endemic poverty and intractable social problems.  Whereas, we have evidence that state capitalist support systems enacted in social democracies have been much more effective.  You're the one presenting a bogus false choice, between being ""altruistic"" and personally donating money and not.  My position is that I'd like to give a large amount of money to building a better world, but only if everyone else in similar circumstances has to do the same.  My position is that I'll give nothing unless we decide collectively that we all must.  My position avoids the free-rider problem and would result in systemic change.  Your position gives people who can afford to be charitable a rationale to think of themselves as altruistic while they're the ones who currently benefit most from inequity."

Probably because slavery accounts for a net harm as opposed to the counterfactual of inaction - a criticism which does not apply to an altruist donating money, so the analogy falls apart. Since most people do not see slavery and modern business as equivalent, they will not buy into your analogy.   I'm guessing what you should want people to do is not earn any unnecessary money whatsoever; if being part of the economy is the harm, then you would want people to subsist on as little as possible in order to best help the developing world. But then you're guilty of the exact same thing you accuse the altruists of asking - you should be asking people to live with minimal possessions, tatters and rags; because having more will entail spending money, and that will entail participation in a harm equivalent to slavery!   And yet you fail repeatedly at finding better metrics    The harder metrics used by altruists include lives saved, diseases treated, years of school provided, and people converted to vegetarianism. The softer metrics used by altruists include poverty reduction, policy changes, and existential risk alleviation.

Debating which metrics to use and what the exchange rate between ""lives saved"" and ""people kept in slavery"" should be just illustrates how absurd the line of reasoning you're using is.

I'm not sure what your criteria for being original or worthwhile enough - while certainly the ideas are not entirely new, they certainly are worthwhile as far as they alleviate a lot of suffering. You can set the bar of cynicism high enough if you want, but it will defeat every other thing you care about as well. Abolition of slavery in 19th century America was not original and it wasn't worthwhile (because it didn't address the structural economic and racist roots of the problem!); I can imagine you back then saying why you didn't like abolitionist efforts because they weren't structural enough. Or for any other topic, e.g. same sex marriage or global warming, efforts could be randomly dismissed as ""not worthwhile"" because they don't solve everything. I don't think that's a good way of going about things.  Regarding originality, you would be hard pressed to find any coherent movement with the strength that EA does today that possessed similar ideas. There were precursor ideas, but they were not as extensive and momentous, nor were they as refined and sophisticated.

philosophy,3cfkc2,stillnotphil,6,Wed Jul 8 00:51:52 2015 UTC,"Effective altruism if followed to the letter is actually almost a paradox.   One of the central tenets of Effective altruism is egalitarianism, that all people's happiness and health are all equally meaningful.   Another of Effective altruism's tenets is that one ought to do the most good.   This leads to a potential paradox when one considers that doing the optimal amount of good is usually not terribly egalitarian.   Consider a physician, who wants to do the most good he possibly can. The optimal solution is to work in Manhattan and only operate on the super-wealthy and completely ignore any poor or even middle class clients. Why is this, this doesn't seen very egalitarian? The answer is because the super-rich are in a better position to effect change than normal people. Saving the life of a poor person saves 1 life. Saving the life of a super-rich person can lead to the saving of potentially millions of lives. Similarly, it makes more sense for firefighters to save 1 home in Hollywood than it makes sense for them to save 100 middle class homes. 1 Hollywood superstar can save more lives with a single check than 100 middle class people working their entire lives.   Therefore, if one wants to be the most egalitarian in the long run, one needs to be exceedingly prejudiced and discriminating in the short run. If one wants to save the most people from malaria and other preventable diseases, it is best served by completely ignoring those populations and servicing the rich. While this fails to truly be a paradox, it does feel wrong somehow."

Not necessarily.  As a reductio ad absurdum, if all physicians try to adopt this strategy, it will no longer be the best way to make money.  In fact, what we see in capitalism is a broad variety of niches, a few of which are focused on serving wealthy individuals and most of which aren't.  And it's not necessarily true that niches that serve wealthy individuals are the most profitable ones.  Walmart is one of the most profitable companies in the US and it's not exactly targeting the ultrawealthy.  Note also: even when niches serving wealthy individuals are the most profitable, they tend to be heavily defended.  As an EA, here's my advice.  If you have a unique opportunity to occupy some highly profitable economic niche that serves wealthy people (e.g. you are the daughter of a world famous surgeon, which practically guarantees you a hotshot surgeon job), you should probably take it.  Otherwise you should just try to make as much money as possible just like any person would in the capitalist economy, with the caveat that if a niche generates a significant amount of consumer surplus, you should evaluate that niche more favorably.  So this would push you towards e.g. building a business that served customers in the developing world (it's easier to generate significant consumer surplus for poor people since their unmet needs are cheaper to fix).

Aside from what others have said this assumes that money -> good in a greater ratio than good acts -> good, which I would disagree with. Money at the sacrifice of good acts delays the influence your good can have on the world. Doing good acts influence immediately - providing support and most importantly inspiring more good when done in repetition. And further - good done through money alone isn't inspiring. It's called charity. And it sounds pitiful to many of us especially when lacking in repetition/feedback. The greatest influences in all of our lives are the Jones' not the Rockefeller's.

Money can be thought of as a subsource of influence. At the end of the day, people work for resources not money. We live in an interesting time as the world has the opportunity to change its affinity to money for greater things with the automation revolution upon us but I digress.  The acts you listed are great things I'd love for any rich person to do but they are anomalies akin to a pitcher hitting a home run. One should not envision the future on such odds. Rich people don't help poor people. And when they do it is denounced 'charity' as I previously mentioned, the good they do do is undervalued.   People with power like to retain their power and since absolute power corrupts absolutely why should we entrust them with it?  If you influence a few rich people to do good like in your original example it means nothing if the whole culture still feeds into their corruption. Not to say it's not helpful, it is, however it is not optimized. Culture and all monumental change is fed from the middle class and out, rich people know this. Hence the shit media that surrounds us and the lack of concern for education in leading nations.  Don't undervalue kindness, it's the base case to good acts. It is the catalyst to all the things you listed, the true source. Saying money takes precedence is ignorant to the influence of kindness.  In moving the future, remember you inspire kindness with kind acts. The more acts you do the better your odds given inspiration is what matters and not the act itself. Money in this context devalues good acts. It in of itself is a barrier to do good - one people internalize unfortunately - and even when it does good the acts are marginalized by this same barrier. In context of goodness, good acts have a greater rate of influence than your low expense index funds."
philosophy,3cfkc2,stillnotphil,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:59:46 2015 UTC,"A number of points:  1) I certainly understand where you are coming from. I empathize with the desire to see a world where good intentions and kindness lead to positive outcomes. I believed that for a large portion of my life. But I fundamentally disagree with many of your statements.   2) ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions"" is an idiom I'm sure you've heard before. Namely, just because you intend to do good doesn't mean that you will. Without having a concrete idea on how that good will come about, good intentions often lead to poor outcomes. Converse, perverse and evil intentions do not always lead to bad outcomes. In fact, capitalism is based on the idea that greed, gluttony, sloth, and pride will incentivize people to invent and innovate and that ultimately all of society will be better off.   3) Name a single hospital that was built without paying construction workers. Name a national monument that was built without spending a dime. Name a bridge or a road that was created without the influence of money. While kindness can lead to positive outcomes, if you physically want to construct something (be it physically construct like a bridge, or more metaphorically construct like an institution/college/safety program) you need $. This is not an anomaly. Almost all physical structures are built with money (indirectly obviously, but you get the point).   4) Money is just more efficient. (Since this is an argument about effective altruism, efficiency is important). 1 person will make roughly $1.5 million in their lifetime (effected by nation, degree, profession etc.) Therefore, one can conclude that if directed towards charitable work, that for the low price of $1.5 million a rich person could hire someone to do good works in their name, and would receive an entire lifetimes worth of good works. For $15 million that person could receive ten lifetimes of good works. For $150 million that person could receive a hundred lifetimes of good works. Therefore, someone with the capacity to earn $150 million but rejects it in favor of kindness and doing good works personally, the world itself functionally loses 99 lifetimes of good works.   5) You mention trust and power, namely that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and therefore we shouldn't trust the rich. What about America's greatest philanthropists : Rockefeller, Carnegie, Morgan, Chase, Gates. Assuredly, they did plenty of good and were rich.   6) You mention that monumental change comes from the middle class out. Does this mean that monumental social change never happened before the year 1945? The middle class is functionally an after-effect of WW2, and never truly existed before then. How then did the American revolution or the abolition of American slavery happen?   TLDR: ""Don't undervalue kindess, the the base case to good acts"" is honorable, noble, and factually inaccurate. It is what we are told to believe, and what we want to believe. It is a myth which we hold close to our hearts since it gives us hope and strength in dark times. However, this flies against the way our entire world is currently structured (capitalism), it ignores the relationship between intention and outcome (namely that they are largely unrelated), and says nothing of efficiency which is the entire point of this article."

philosophy,3cfkc2,Ihatecheese86,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:06:29 2015 UTC,"This suffers from the same problem as other discussions of effective altrusim.    Imagine everyone in society donates everything they earn except the bare necessities to survive.  I realize effective altrusim doesn't require this, but just imagine.  That society will no longer have investment, serious economic growth or the innovation that typically accompanies a consumer based culture (making more things, faster, lighter, and cheaper).  This means that any time a donation is made a trade-off is involved.  Every dollar given to charities is a dollar that could be reinvested in economic growth- in turn creating wider opportunities, increased standard of living or even just more excess income to donate.    None of the metrics used for 'measuring' effective altruism take this into account.  They focus purely on the 'seen' and not the 'unseen'.  Economists call this the broken window fallacy.    This is indicative of a broader problem with effective altruism.  It has a philosophy component and an economic component.  The philosophic component is simple and rarely discussed- we should try to do the greatest good.  The economic component determines how to achieve the greatest good.  Singer, being a philosopher, perhaps rightly latches onto the principle that operates here.  However, Singer is not an economist, nor Matt Wage.  Serious interest in what effective alturism purports to do would require less amateur economic analysis.  However, I suspect the conclusions would cast some doubt on charity as a meaningful way to address the causes of poverty and disease in the world."
philosophy,3cfkc2,alquixloddix,13,Tue Jul 7 19:28:38 2015 UTC,"Imagine everyone in society donates everything they earn except the bare necessities to survive.   The thing is that, ideally, in this scenario, assuming effective altruists act according to their own beliefs, it would gradually (as more and more people donate) become the altruistic thing to invest, promote economic growth, etc., as the diminishing returns of charitable donations become clear. I think you are assuming that effective altruists would act the same way as they do in this world, in a very different world.  Nevertheless, I agree that in order to effectively analyse the best causes, a thorough understanding of economics is needed - I don't know how much, for example, GiveWell use economics in their analysis of charities, but it is definitely needed. I suspect that most effective altruists would agree on the importance of economics - one prominent economist in the effective altruism community is Robin Hanson, and I am sure that there are others."

I think you are assuming that effective altruists would act the same way as they do in this world, in a very different world.   I think the underlying assumption in that paragraph is this world has reached an optimum point of economic growth, and that additional economic growth would be superfluous.  I don't think that's the case.  So the point of the thought experiment is to show a trade-off between potential goods, charity vs. economic growth (given, there can be overlap), and raise the question as to which is more effective at addressing the causes of poverty (in this world, right now).     I suspect that most effective altruists would agree on the importance of economics - one prominent economist in the effective altruism community is Robin Hanson, and I am sure that there are others.   Thanks, I'll look into him."
philosophy,3cfkc2,alquixloddix,5,Tue Jul 7 20:17:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree the trade-off exists, but I don't think it's as significant as you are making out. Charitable donations are still spent by charities, contributing to GDP, increasing productivity, etc. Really the question is ""which method of investment/expenditure does the most good?"", and it definitely seems like investment or expenditure that does explicit good (i.e. charity) would probably come near the top of that list. So unless there is some company, or some good, that you think is going to do a huge amount of good, charitable donations come pretty near the top.  Also, you may find it interesting to compare the GiveWell reviews of Give Directly (giving money to poor people as a means of economic empowement) vs. microfinance (lending money to poor people as a means of economic empowerment)."
philosophy,3cfkc2,UmamiSalami,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:29:59 2015 UTC,"It's not clear that there even is a real tradeoff right now between economic growth and charity.

philosophy,3cfkc2,Hroppa,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:11:15 2015 UTC,"Actually, it's a misunderstanding that the effective altruist community only cares about donations to charities. 80,000 hours is an effective altruist careers organisation, and it recommends entrepreneurship as an altruistic option because of the potential impact on growth. The same could be said about certain research careers.  Also, when charity evaluators try to consider the impact of a charity, growth effects can be an important factor. (Intuitively, it doesn't seem obvious why the investment producing the best return to the investor would be the most promising one for spurring growth)"
philosophy,3cfkc2,adfgionio,4,Wed Jul 8 07:04:11 2015 UTC,"Singer's argument is based on utilitarianism. The requirement to donate to charity is valid only in certain circumstances.

You are objecting to Singer's specific recommendations and ignoring the philosophical core."

If you donate money it doesn't just go into a hole and stay there; it's spent on services to help other people. Some of it pays the salaries of the charity's employees who then spend that money, putting it back into the economy.  I think you're right that what benefits the overall economy generally benefits most people, but to imply that giving to charity and benefiting the economy are diametrically opposed is wrong."

That inherently implies that there is an entity enforcing said undefined amount of good based on each individuals ability to do good and that the end is but to compel someone's toil and labor with the barrel of a gun.   A better argument for ""selfish altruism"" would be that it is in ones own interest to make the world a better place and in fact our efforts our rewarded with the ability to alter the world we live in. And therefore it is in our interests to leave this place and all the people and creatures living in it better off. It is ethical to help others expecting that the help you provided someone to say gain an education could result in that newly educated human to go on to do any number of greater things due to that intervention.

philosophy,3cfkc2,UmamiSalami,0,Wed Jul 8 00:41:43 2015 UTC,"I think it's a little unfortunate that the focus has so decisively been around alleviating poverty. The problem is that lifting developing nations out of poverty also causes a substantial increase in their meat consumption, so much that it's really questionable just how good of an action it is to make the developing world become wealthy. Singer himself sees poverty alleviation as more of an introductory idea that gets people acquainted with altruistic ideas, because vegan advocacy and AI research are more important. I currently think the latter issue dwarfs all other things in importance (here's a simple article about it, perhaps some of the computational science/philosophy of mind experts here would take issue with some of its claims and simplifications, but it is an article for popular consumption, just be charitable with the basic ideas). So I guess it's good that more and more people are getting involved with poverty and health intervention, but by no means to the hard questions stop there. Is it still good to make countries richer when it will cause them to emit more greenhouse gases and build a lot of factory farms? Is friendly/unfriendly AI research an issue worth putting time and money into? Do we even want to risk creating a super-AI at all, or would it be better if humanity simply failed to reach that technological level? How should we act if that is the case? It is thorny."

It's a bit like religion, growing in poorer countries with higher birth rates and declining slowly in richer countries, if a countries development is slowed, that will just delay the point at which they reduce their meat consumption, and prolong the period of increasing meat demand.   Also once more poverty issues are resolved there will be spare people to focus on other advocacy and also more people within the current poorer countries campaigning for these issues.  Thinking long term it seems to make more sense to reduce poverty first."

To which I can only reply, Well, Yeah. There would be.  'If the universe was perpetual' is fishy. Suppose nothing changed, but entropy ran in reverse from time to time, and balanced itself out.

To anyone who accepts basic tenets of logic and rationality, altruism can make sense. As for anyone who denies those premises, they really don't have the epistemic tools to make any kind of argument against altruism. So it's not concerning. And usually we realize that it's a completely different issue. You can have a different belief about those things, if you can back it up - sure, that's valid. But it's strange to insist that every normative issue be accompanied with a rehash of basic arguments for the validity of epistemology and rationality. That would be like telling an engineer that he has to derive his equations all over again each time he builds a bridge.

But a weakness and/or may be the strength of the paper is that it puts issues in Hegelian writing style, more obfuscated that I think is necessary. What is lacking in general I think, is unbiased untangling of Hegel's ""Phenomenology"", most unintelligible of his writings, in terms that resonate with familiar psychological and social concepts and processes which ironically, understanding were vastly influenced by Hegel.  Also I did realize how we all are hopelessly bias when reading Hegel not in the original but in translations depending who translated it  and what words were used (Master vs. Lord, Servant vs Bondsman, Mind vs. Spirit) in translations of  Baillie vs. Miller. It seems to bring different meaning to our understanding."

Particularly the progression from following pleasure / pain / maximizing happiness progressing to doing good for goods sake / fulfillment, and how that too, will eventually burn out over time.  Do you know any philosophers who go to that next step, without jumping to religion / god?  I've read a few philosophers that push the ultimate plane being a religiously defined experience, and that simply doesn't resonate with me.  I've read a few eastern philosophers that describe learning from all those experiences, and using that gained wisdom to simply enjoy life as it passes (before enlightenment, wash floor, carry water, after enlightenment, wash floor, carry water), but that only works so far for me, at my current stage in life.  I've read a few philosophers that push on, saying, live!  while you still can, live!  But I think it helps that many of them died young.  I'm curious what other answers are out there."
philosophy,3cd26r,Lyzl,14,Tue Jul 7 03:14:21 2015 UTC,"During and after the existential movement, beginning with Kierkegaard, the question of meaning in life becomes more difficult. If you agree with Kierkegaard the the Aesthetic (pleasure seeking) and the Ethical (communal agreement) don't work, but don't like his conclusion, there were a whole bunch of options as new solutions, but  they had to take the openness this leaves you into account.  If you turned back to the Greeks, you had (1) Searching for eternal truths in the Platonic forms; but this led to a generally ethical way of thinking. Or (2) Following Aristotle's Virtue Ethics, which became quite popular again in the last 50 or so years. He advocates taking personal responsibility for the right course of action in any given situation. 'Right' here means what you believe your best self would do in that context. Sometimes you can't easily figure out what your best self would do and need to think long and hard at it, hence the philosophy of virtue ethics.   There was also the Stoics, which were somewhat Buddhist in thinking that there is a lot in life we can't control. We should control and master ourselves and surroundings to the degree possible, while always keeping in mind the limit of our powers, and not becoming devastated when that limit ruins our work (like a natural disaster or bad political regime change).   Other thinkers used the Greeks differently. Nietzsche believed that early Greeks, in his The Birth and Death of Tragedy, struck a balance between Order and Chaos, personified by Apollo and Dionysus. We needed order in life to organize and stabilize communal life, we needed chaos to give us art, rebirth, and progress at the cost of a fixed order. Nietzsche translated this latter in his life into a new kind of existentialism, admiring a kind of artistic mastery over life, a progress towards greater capabilities and the overcoming of limits. This way of thinking about life is quite popular, and probably best represents what people generally mean when they say they are 'existentialist', although Sartre is the one who coined the term.   Heidegger later organized existentialism into a deep metaphysics. It is truly difficult to synthesize any of his thought quickly without allowing for great misinterpretation. He was primarily concerned with our idea of 'Being', what it is for something 'to Be', and through this, shows that things don't exist just as they are 'out there' in the world, but rather that the world is something constructed by us through our uses of that raw material. That is, our idea of 'desk', for example, something that exists for us, is really a constructed thing - a tree stump could become a desk if we look at it in the right way. Through this way of looking at the world, he comes to some conclusions as to what the consequences of such a world are to us, thus spawning most of 20th century continental philosophy.  Most thinkers, in some variation or another, moved on to thinking about a very flexible, Heideggarian-influenced world. Many were also influenced by Wittgenstein's later work, the Philosophical Investigations, which similarly explicated a new world in which our language is much looser than we have been given to believe. Language, which encompasses thought for Witt, is really a game of coming up with terms to order the world, other people agreeing or disagreeing, and eventually establishing a fixed order of symbols and their meanings that wraps around a particular view of the world.   After these two thinkers, philosophy has really gotten into trouble figuring out any fixed meanings whatsoever. A kind of general 'post-modern' thinking took over, by which I simply mean a kind of thinking that meaning and a correct path in life is impossible to pin down. If there is one, it is at minimum something that changes with context, with our view of the world, with the changing tides of peoples and cultures. The 'post-moderns' simply give up on the idea that there is a single unified way of life, whether that be Aristotelian, Christian or another religion, or any other doctrine (Communism, Existentialism, Anarchism, Stoicism, Buddhism, Science, or the pursuit of Art, Nature, Romance, or Happiness)."

That doesn't stop massive amounts of philosophers from trying, but they all stop short of being convincing because of such criticism.   Of course, there are huge numbers of philosophers working in ethics, meta-ethics and political philosophy who have a lot to say about certain things we should or shouldn't do. They all generally refrain, however, from giving concrete goals to life. Instead they point out obviously bad routes of life and eliminate them.   Modern political philosophy especially gives grand proposals to the duties and responsibilities nations have to their people and to other nations. This says little about what we should do as individuals, but provides a basis for a society in which we can live and pursue our goals."

philosophy,3cd26r,paniniconqueso,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:10:08 2015 UTC,"That makes about as much sense as talking about Christian philosophy outside of its religious tradition(s). Buddhist philosophy goes hand in hand with the religion in the same way that Christian philosophy goes with the religion. St. Bonaventure was not a philosopher first and a Christian second, he was both at the one time. Similarly, Nagarjuna, Candrakirti, Shantideva, Buddhaghosa etc are all religious (and they believe in the standard cosmology of gods to boot) and also philosophers."
philosophy,3cd26r,ButNotYou_NotAnymore,2,Tue Jul 7 20:16:46 2015 UTC,"But beliefs in gods are completely peripheral to Buddhist philosophy and in fact they make a point of saying worldly gods cannot help you reach liberation so don't petition them for anything. They basically say gods are useless in the scheme of the teachings. So you're being equally disingenuous by trying to force theistic faith onto Buddhists when they don't actually focus on gods - it's more like they accept them as a reality of the religions around them, but they don't actually play a role in Buddhist philosophy. Signing up to practice Buddhist philosophy is not signing up to theism."
philosophy,3cd26r,ButNotYou_NotAnymore,2,Tue Jul 7 20:22:03 2015 UTC,"Fair play to most of those arguments. However, Buddhist philosophy is increasingly abstracted from any theistic belief, not just in new, Western traditions, but people of traditional forms of Buddhism, too. I met many monks out in Sri Lanka that do not believe in gods but still believe in the Theravada way of liberation, and Theravada traditionally does accept the existence of deities.  'Is the reality of deities an important question for Buddhism' is a much better question to ask, and I believe the answer is a resounding no. Deities are not needed for Buddhism to operate. The fact that deities exist in the religion are because they are grandfathered in from Indian religion(s), not because they're essential to the workings of the philosophy — but I expect you already know that, since you are quite knowledgeable on Buddhism.   Can you not accept in good faith that Buddhism can function atheistically and largely does so now in the West (which has a new diaspora of modern Buddhist traditions, merging with the 'local' philosophies of rationalism and empiricism as it has merged with local traditions in any other country it's ever migrated into), hence apart of Buddhism, period, changing its character once again in another change that is the on-going story of Buddhism's history.  So is are all Buddhisms atheistic? No. Are all Buddhisms theistic? No. It's a largely correct soundbite to say Buddhism is not atheistic, but it's not technically correct and thus I feel it is (often, intentionally) misleading (to ward off ""rational"" thinkers from ever inquiring to begin with, due to a perceived notion that Buddhism has nothing to offer the atheistic thinker/philosopher, which is blatantly not true). ""In any case, Buddhism is NOT atheistic"" is categorically wrong because there are cases of atheistic Buddhism, regardless of whether that is the majority position or not.   Buddhism has more to offer the atheist than Christian philosophy, because theistic belief is core to the soteriology within, whereas in Buddhism, liberation does not depend on whether gods exist or not. Only the capacity for suffering and the capacity for freedom from that suffering."
philosophy,3cd26r,ep1032,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:09:25 2015 UTC,"Well, as mentioned in the video, there is the Freudian route: the death drive. Lacan later formulated and elaborated on it more thoroughly. To simplify things, our substantial being is composed of a certain relationship to the object a: the object cause of desire. There are a number of different relationships one can have with it. Part of oneself could be it, one could be desiring it, etc. Our subject is constitutive by our relationship to it, in fact, the structure of fantasy is the barred subject(the unsymbolizable excess of immediate reality, the ""nothing"" that is left over that was carried over from the previous moment) coupled with the object a.  Now, this isn't our substantial being. Our substantial being is that of the symbolic and the imaginary registers(equal to the objective and subjective spirit in Hegel), while the subject and object a lie in the real, the ""suprasensible"" that is unformalizeable, except it's not exactly suprasensible, but follows the logic of the Hegelian ""appearance as appearance."" The subject IS the radical negativity, the void, which follows through in creating the substantial future. The object a is the lack which the subject chases after, but never achieves it. The object a is a primordial lack. Fundamentally unobtainable. When we are stuck in the imaginary, the ""subjective""(in the commonsensical, not Lacanian) part of our experience, we aren't aware of the nuances of our symbolic, and the real(the subject and the object a, the void and the lack). The imaginary 'covers up' the symbolic network which structure our social relation, and also misplaces and misrecognizes our object a, our object cause of desire. The real is what is primary here, it is what structures the mode of the symbolic, upon which the imaginary projects its confusion. With desire, we continually miss our object, again and again, or in other words, the conditions for our desiring is continually reproduced, but due to the effects of the symbolic and the imaginary, we are unable to accept this as our fundamental reality.  There are a lot of interesting niceties here, such as the superego injunction to enjoy, where jouissance(enjoyment) is the continual missing the object. The difference between the superego and the Law(or Master signifier) is the superego is basically an effect of object a, it still functions without a recognized law(in fact, in cases where no law is clear, the role of the analyst is to find the corresponding law for the superego they have, so then they can see what law they unconsciously follow). It functions as things like guilt and whatnot, it's an internal psychical phenomena, as opposed to an external law approaching as a command. This all structures our fantasy that we go through, continually missing the object a. The goal of the analyst is to pull us through, to see it for what it is, ""appearance as appearance"". We don't ""break out"" of the fantasy, but we are made to ""traverse"" it, to be acquainted with it, to be pulled out of our imaginary cloudiness, which transforms our relationship to the object.  Originally object a was seen as an empirical object. Now, we see that this object fills the primordial lack. This is like how Kant's transcendental object fills out the thing-in-itself. the thing-in-itself being the primordial object, and the transcendental object being the imaginary stand-in. After ""traversing the fantasy"" we still acknowledge how the object a(an analogy is frequently used, that the object a is like a black whole in that it curves space itself, it shapes the very spatial framework which we must live in) maintains itself. Basically, we acknowledge that when we desire an object, it's consumed, the ""object a"" remains, it's the surplus from our enjoyment, it's what makes us ""desire"" again. But, after traversing the fantasy, we can posit this as such, we can not be fooled into thinking we will satiate our desire, and it's no longer our (very short sighted) goal. We accept jouissance, and continually miss the object, but our aim is beyond it. We can intervene at the level of the symbolic and create a new a social order, as we aren't caught up in fantasies. We accept the perverse pleasure-in-pain that we get in continually missing the desired object.  How is this different? We get beyond the perpetual moving-on-to-something else, by understanding we never will satiate our desire. Instead, we intervene and ""play the game"" essentially, to open up the space where a more healthy functioning can take place. The analyst gives knowledge of one's desire, so that the status quo the patient is engaged in can hopefully be changed based on the new-found knowledge."
philosophy,3cd26r,EtherealWeasel,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:44:35 2015 UTC,"If I read this correctly, and I may not have, it sounds like what you just described the ability to show an individual, or learn for oneself, how one's desires arise from the objects and situations around them, in the hope that they can then selectively choose which desires one will allow to arise within oneself, and thereby be less a slave to their own environment.  But I suppose what I'm asking is what selections have great philosophers made once they've realized this concept for themselves (even if they differ in how it works internally)?

Many Eastern philosophers choose to follow the tide of life wherever it may point them, but experience the experiences more fully for their gained knowledge.  Etc."

Given his charitable (though not uncritical) attitude toward modern atheists such as Feuerbach and Schopenhauer, on which see the last five paragraphs of this post, I think Kierkegaard would be more than willing to engage in dialogue with the atheist.  Compare also the points he and Nietzsche have in common.  Additionally, not every piece of Kierkegaard’s thought is connected to every other piece through bonds of absolute logical necessity. This is probably true of most philosophers, and in the present case this is partly why the existentialists—the atheists no less than the theists—managed to be enriched by many of his ideas. They didn’t all require signing on to theism—Christian or otherwise.   And isn't the ""Leap of Faith"" harder than he admits, first to God, and then to a Christian God?   The difficulty of the leap of faith is dialectical, which is to say that it is at once infinitely difficult and infinitely easy. From the side of human effort, it is simply impossible due to our finitude and especially our defiant despair, our sinfulness. But from the side of self-surrender, which is less a positive act than a getting out of one’s own way, a dying to oneself, ultimately God does the work as he provides the gifts of faith, hope, and love (on which see Kierkegaard’s For Self-Examination, pp. 79-87).   And aren't we then tired with the jumping?   Tired momentarily, or permanently exhausted?"

I mean that although we rely on hypothesis, evidence, theory, and it is integral to our academic worldview in the sciences. This workflow itself is an ideology based on ideas in logic. What are the upsides and downsides to thinking about the world in such a reductive way. There is a choice made that the scientific method will provide the best closest approximation to our world, and that choice is based on a belief.  I'm a Physicist, not a philosopher, but this is something I think about frequently and have tried to read on. I hope I got my point across.

The basic idea of fallibilism is the obvious assertion: "" Nobody is perfect"" or more relevantly, ""No theory is perfect"".  TLDR: the scientific method is a proving ground for theories. Experiments separate what physicists call true or false. As an example, quantum mechanics would never have gained acceptance if it werent for the fact that any other theory used to explain a particular experiment was proven false."

I would say that this is mostly incorrect actually. It's just about where a person has gone with their thought. Of course authority is going to precede morality for a lot of people, because authority is where morality comes from in the first place for pretty much everyone. It's just a matter of who has thought beyond that, of who has invested themselves more so in moralistic thought or whatever. Not everyone does. Most people just live simple lives following the rules, never really wondering about the worth of those rules.

philosophy,3ca7w1,purpledranked,19,Tue Jul 7 00:16:57 2015 UTC,"One thing to consider is that the Stanford prison experiments can hardly qualify as valid experiments. The experiment completely lacks random assignment. Zimbardo chose his guards, instructed them how to behave (doing line ups, roughing up the inmates), and just general involved himself in the project as a subject. This project was unethical, not primarily because of the resulting brutality, but because Zimbardo instigated it. It tells us nothing about roles and the power they have over behavior, because he told the guards how to behave. Zimbardo doesn't deserve his fame, because these experiments were more the fulfillment of his twisted fantasies in which he got to play warden in his own prison game and dictated the results to match his theory. You want to see a masterful experiment, look at Milgram. He had perfect random assignment of the levels of the independent variable with perfect control of other affecting variables and he did it without hurting anyone. He even made the people who never stopped shocking the pretend student feel better about their obedience to authority in a post experiment debrief."
philosophy,3ca7w1,halfascientist,6,Tue Jul 7 00:18:25 2015 UTC,"The experiment completely lacks random assignment   If you're going to criticize a study, at least offer reasonably-informed criticism.  No it doesn't.  Participants were randomly assigned to guard or inmate roles.  The study included fully random assignment.  Additionally, nonrandom assignment isn't some kind of thing that kills a study.  We assign nonrandomly or semi-randomly for lots of reasons, to address lots of scientific questions.  It is and can be a limit on inference when you're interpreting data, it isn't, at all, some kind of thing that make study bad.   He had perfect random assignment of the levels of the independent variable with perfect control of other affecting variables and he did it without hurting anyone.   ""Perfection"" in these areas is not an achievable goal for any experiment.  No experimental control of human beings is ""perfect.""  Milgram, and any informed behavioral scientist who reads him, would disagree with this characterization."
philosophy,3ca7w1,purpledranked,2,Mon Jul 6 17:21:03 2015 UTC,"Those are fair points. More what I mean is that his study lacked controlled independent variables which could be replicated. By using lack of random assignment I confused the issue and instead should have said that after randomly assigning prisoners and guards he screwed up that assignment by modifying the independent variable as time went on. First it was simply being called a guard of prisoner. Then it was that guard also means you are told to force prisoners to do lineups. Then it was that guard means amuse yourself by tormenting prisoners. You're right that I used the wrong term, but I think it's hard to call his findings valid when perhaps the largest causal force in his experiment was the instruction he gave to the guards.  As to Milgram and perfect, you're right that this is exaggerated. I was speaking hyperbolically. My overzealous support of Milgram is the result of the two scientists being compared as the minds behind two great social experiments. Which I would call and unjust comparison to Milgram since his experiment was substantially better."

Then it was that guard means amuse yourself by tormenting prisoners.   I'm sorry, but no, there were no instructional changes along those lines during the course of the study.  Zimbardo screwed up in lots of ways, but not those ones.  You're just misinformed about how the thing went and how it worked.  Indeed, most of Zimbardo's (ethical) failures were in the area of failing to intervene and instruct the guards, and he erred very much on that side during the course of the study.   it's hard to call his findings valid when perhaps the largest causal force in his experiment was the instruction he gave to the guards.   That's the point and the core of many social psychological studies, and other behavioral science studies.  The relevant intervention is an instructional condition.  Group A was told this, Group B was told this.  Real-life contingencies are themselves often instructional conditions.  To say nothing of the ethics, one of the difficult-to-replicate, problematic-with-respect-to-internal-validity things about Stanford Prison is that the instructional conditions were vague and tricky to operationalize (and thus, interpret for the purposes of future research).  Unfortunately, that's somewhat of the phenomenon that Zimbardo was attempting to study--authorities in coercive environments are often given vague instructions about how to do their jobs.  His and others' review of Abu Ghraib seemed to observe that kind of phenomenon: the poor supervision and vague instructions given to guards (e.g., ""do whatever you need to do to keep that scum under control"") was part of the mix that perhaps helped create what occurred there.  There are lots of methodological issues with Stanford Prison; it's a messy study (again, even before we talk about ethics).  It still says more than the now-popular critiques of it suppose that it does.  I think, and hope, that my students have left my class with the study (and others in the controversial Golden Age of Social Psych) appropriately contextualized, and a solid understanding of what they do tell us.  At any rate, it's silly to talk about it out-of-context from the body of work that surrounds it and comes after it--people talk about it like it itself is some kind of question about how humans work--no, it's a stroke in a letter in a word in the sentence that is that question, and there is plenty of other research that supports some of the conclusions that are so controversial when people talk about Stanford Prison independently.  It's far from our only piece of research which suggests that human beings will absorb and identify with social roles in powerful ways, behave aggressively towards individuals who they are told belong to different or inferior groups, etc.  There are many fair critiques of the study from a number of perspectives.  Zimbardo will offer most of them himself.  I'm sorry, but I don't think anything you've said here constitutes an informed critique."
philosophy,3ca7w1,purpledranked,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:11:31 2015 UTC,"I have watched the entire Stanford prison experiment including Zimbardo's own criticism of it. He changes his instructions from his initial meeting. Their entire trip out of the basement to a different room is on his order to move the prisoners. This was out of fear that one of the released prisoners would try to free the others. My point is that he was the warden, not an observer.   It does undermine his findings, when he tells the guards how to behave. His study is about the changed behavior as a result of being put in a role. However, he did not say only that the role was ""guard."" He said the role was ""guard, and guard means that you rough up prisoners, force lineups, etc."" his findings that they behaved a particular way as a result of being placed in that role are certainly compromised since to a large extent he told them how to behave in that role.   It's like if I told you to spend a week in the role of a marine. But then I said, marine means that you exercise 3 hours a day are generally brutish or violent. Then I find that in that role you've begun to exercise vigorously and have a new proclivity towards violence. And now I say that it matches my theory that placing you in a role changed your behavior. When in fact I told you how I wanted you to behave. That is what Zimbardo did.  And yes, obviously this is not the only experiment done on this phenomenon. That was never in the discussion. Plenty of other real world examples show that guards behave abnormally cruelly. Further, other experiments show the impact of roles on behavior. I'm saying Zimbardo's study is compromised by his own behavior in the study."

What is the independent variable given that he changes the instructions? How are we supposed to draw any conclusions when his independent variable changes. We can hardly have any idea of what causal force caused which outcome. Why did the guards behave as they did? Is that what they think guards do? Is it because he told them that guards do lineups and the like? Is it because he told them they needed to prevent escape attempts. It is a methodological problem to not have an independent variable that is measurable or distinguishable.

Stanford Prison is, in most ways, not really an ""experiment"" (in that its major comparison is not between the two groups along the independent variable) and is honestly best-conceptualized as a kind of case study (albeit a case study of two groups).  Case studies allow for weak inferences in most areas, but a single very strong inference in one area: you can draw from them quite confidently an inference that something exists.  They are ""proof of existence.""    So, Clive Wearing doesn't constitute a controlled experiment on how memory works, but he is ""proof"" that certain kinds of memory and cognitive functions operate separately from one another.  He produces a couple of very small but very important answers, and from those small answers, more interesting questions.  Stanford Prison, similarly, functions best as a case study.  And it's more or less a ""proof of existence"" of situationalism.  The most important part of Stanford Prison, and the one that nobody ever mentions, is the pre-screener.  Zimbardo found dudes that we're pretty normal.  They had average to above average intelligences, were free of major psychopathology, free of criminal/antisocial/conduct/behavioral problems, and so on.  Observing evil or antisocial behavior, we're more or less caught between situationalist and characterological attributions.  What Zimbardo did--although he failed to fully grasp what he was and was not doing at the time--was to show that one could get people who were, at pre-test verified to be, in most of the ways we'd suggest evaluating such a thing, not bad dudes, and create a situation in which bad behavior would emerge.  That's what's important about the study; that's what makes it more than Milgram.  Milgram just relied on our prejudices as to the normality of regular white dude workingmen from Cambridge, Mass as ""pretty much alright guys"" to establish one leg of this inference.  Stanford Prison actually tested it.  It's Milgram plus a pre-screener.  In any kind of purely speculative, a priori discussion of whether or not people are bad because they're bad or because the situation makes them bad, a person might propose, ""well, do you think that we could possibly make people whose character and behavior does not reveal any signs of badness that we think are relevant become bad, or do bad things, by subjecting them to some situation of our contrivance?""  That's an important question for that discussion.  Zimbardo answered it; the answer is yes.  Now, if we accept that question as answered, perhaps the next big question is: ""can we get them to 'think of those bad things on their own,' rather than just do what instructed?""  Zimbardo, at times, has appeared to advocate that Stanford Prison also answered this one affirmatively, but there is a lot to be said for a perspective that the demand characteristics on the subjects were pretty substantial.  I actually lean towards that side, and I don't believe that this questions has been answered affirmatively, or at all, by Stanford Prison.  However, I regard it as a much less interesting and important one than the former.  It is interesting, though, and if I had an ethics-free box to re-run a bunch of follow-ups in, I'd probably want six Stanford Prisons running under different instructional conditions from high to low demand."

I think there is a significant problem in trying to reconceptualise an experiment as a case study but regardless, I can agree definitely that case studies allow us to reach certain conclusions but these conclusions are limited almost entirely to the situation itself. So we can say that it's evidence that those students did some of the things described, but trying to generalise to other people or make claims about causal mechanisms is speaking way beyond the data.   It's even more problematic given that Zimbardo was the designer of the experiment, a participant, and the one describing and interpreting the data. So to compare it to a case study would be like using the case study from a person describing their own results, whilst recognising that they started the study with a specific conclusion in mind (which will presumably affect their interpretations of the events).

To make it even harder to reach a situationist conclusion, we also have to deal with the fact that most of the guards didn't engage in the behaviors that Zimbardo's conclusions predicted.   That's an important question for that discussion. Zimbardo answered it; the answer is yes.   But again, we have no idea if the answer is yes or not. Accepting his results at face value, the answer seems to be: probably not (at least not for most people). More realistically the answer is 'we can't be sure' because we have no idea whether these people were good people or not - sure, we know that they aren't extreme psychopaths, but that doesn't make them normal or mean that their behavior can only be explained by the situation."

And no doubt situationism throws a spanner in the works for virtue ethicists, as the author calls them. But I do think she goes too far in suggesting the possibility of some circumstance which inevitably could bring us all to commit horrendous acts, stemming, I think, from a misunderstanding or overestimation of the mechanics at play.  The way I’ve learned of situationism (though it hasn’t ever been of that name), it has always been rational. Derren Brown actually uses the mechanics of it in his documentary ‘The Heist’, wherein he speaks to a group of people, gets them to rationalise the committing of some violent act under certain circumstances, associating the rationalisation with inert things in the environment around, such as is expounded upon in the article (the noise of the lawnmower), which he later uses as triggers. But the important thing is that the act remains rational, sort of decided upon, even if the rationalisation is triggered by nonsense.  A good example of situationism, I think, is crimes of passion. We let people off for supposedly committing horrendous acts in the moment, for not having premeditated the act. But is that really true? I think it’s actually a case of this situationism, that instead we have rationalised the act ages beforehand; that, though it might not relate to some specific person and some specific time, instead it relates to all people and all times, provided only some certain situation arises. And again, it is rational. We are in control. I mean you’re hardly going to suggest that evolution brought about crimes of passion, right? That’s some massively complex inherency. No, better that we bring them about ourselves, through world building after the fact.  Though, of course, the author is correct in that she suggests we must be more careful with our moralising given situationism; it’s certainly something very tricky. In fact it even casts a great absurdity on moralising as a whole, I think, in that it takes us far away from old conceptions, of the soul and such, of simple conceptions of good and evil, very much into the land of machines. Indeed, given situationism, moralising now goes hand in hand with something that’s very, very similar to computer programming, leaving it a rather inaccessible pursuit.  I think to succeed as a moralist these days, one must not just be good, but also insist of themselves that they will be good in all circumstances. I think this very simply trumps situationism, casting aside what I think are the author of this article's erroneous suggestions that we might all be inherently wicked in some way. We are bred to follow authority, and that, seemingly, precedes personal morality in many (and quite understandably, right?); but all we need do to change that is to tell ourselves otherwise, that, no, it does not. I mean rationality certainly does still seem primary. But hey, maybe I'm wrong. God save us."

This language of the 'subjective' being applied to a 'subject's' intentional state is what existential phenomenology destructs.  Mood (for Heidegger), or as the article states, 'existential feeling', is not properly understood within a subject-object ontology.  In any event, the book the article talks about is derivative--in a good sense.  Heidegger was always way up the ladder of abstraction (which in a sense is strange given how directed his phenomenology was towards the concrete, practical, everyday-ness of being-in-the-world).    The article seems fine enough to understand to me, but I'm completely taken with existential phenomenology and while I am not a professional philosopher, I read it and study it as a hobby almost daily.  The problem with writing it more 'clearly' or 'well' is that this objection does not reveal the true question: why is it written the way it is?  The answer: it makes it very difficult to break with a whole tradition of thinking which dominates today (subject-object, social science, modern scientific thinking) if you use the same terms.  In short, it muddies up the description and hinders us from seeing the thing as it is.  When reading Heidegger, often when I come across a term of art, I try to imagine or equate it to what is commonly thought of if that is possible.  Then I try to clarify the phenomena as he is describing it.  Sometimes a helpful trick for reading phenomenology.  Then hold that description up to your own experiences and understanding to assess it.  Anyways, sounds like an interesting book--but I won't say anything more about the philosophy or phenomenology of mood (and the derivative existential analytic of depression) since it would necessarily require more 'difficult' descriptions."

philosophy,3ccp3j,StevenLrock,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:25:47 2015 UTC,"Okay, I agree that Heidegger's view on subjectivity is arguably more outward in its focus; however, in the tradition of Husserl, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, Phenomenology is intensely concerned with subjectivity. This is not to say that Phenomenology should necessarily explain subjectivity - instead, Merleau-Ponty, in Phenomenology of Perception (1945), writes that Phenomenology's role is to operate as a descriptive exercise. (We can debate whether Phenomenology can or should explain phenomena, but in any case the point remains that there is not necessarily a consensus on this among Phenomenologists).   One should not view Phenomenology as a totally introspective exercise -  it is not exclusively concerned with inner states at the expense of looking outward at the world of others and objects. Nonetheless, when we go 'back to the things themselves' (to use Husserl's dictum), we engage with a world that is completely soaked in our subjective states."
philosophy,3ccp3j,Copenhagen2014,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:58:21 2015 UTC,"First, (and I don't know why you're capitalizing it) there are different kinds of phenomenology.  The kind of interpretative phenomenology that I mainly agree with is Heideggerian, as fundamental existential ontology.  Heidegger completely reversed phenomenology from what we take that word to mean when it is used in connection with Husserl.  Both Heidegger and Husserl advocated for going ""back to the things themselves""--it was Husserl's slogan first, but Heidegger who worked under and with him for years repeated it.  But, the point is that getting ""back to the things themselves"" is fundamentally different for both of them.  Husserl brackets the external world in order to spell-out the intentional contents of consciousness/subjectivity and find the self-evident basis for it (which is just a continuation in the Cartesian line of thinking).  Heidegger starts with the idea of 'worldhood'--which has a specific meaning.  So the first part of your comment completely equivocates what 'phenomenology' means when taken up by different philosophers in different ways.  If we were to categorize them, there are probably three main kinds of phenomenology when viewed generally.  You also equivocate the word 'description' by using it along with 'phenomenology'.  To be certain, phenomenology is not an introspective exercise.  It need not even be an exercise in looking to the 'outer world' for other 'minds' and 'objects'--the problem of other minds and the external world.  This is again NOT existential phenomenology.  Secondly, regarding your last point about a world completely soaked in subjective states.  What does this even mean...  What is 'world'?  What is the 'subjective'? Does the 'subjective' have one 'state' or many, and what are their determinations?  How do the 'states' of 'subjectivity' relate to the 'world'?  Now, you say that this becomes evident when we 'engage' with the world... what is this 'engagement'?  How and what does it reveal to us?  Is the engagement itself subjective, or a state of subjectivity, that brings us over into an understanding of the world?  You say the relation between the 'world' and subjective states is 'complete'--what does this indicate about the relation?  Is the 'world' only 'subjective', or a 'state' of the 'subjective', meaning that the 'subjective' is something more?  Can we know what this 'more' might be since our route to seeing the 'subjective' seems to be through the 'world'?  You've presupposed the whole subject-object ontology (which is mostly attributable to Descartes for its beginning--he first called us 'subjects').  Going back to my quote from Heidegger in the previous post, starting from this point is an error."
philosophy,3ccp3j,StevenLrock,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:29:52 2015 UTC,"As pedantic as it may seem, it is not uncommon to capitalise Phenomenology if one is referring to the academic discipline of Phenomenology, with all of the competing claims, scholarly exegesis, armchair abstractions, etc. that the academic discipline entails. This is especially necessary given that a lot of philosophers - including those of an analytic persuasion - tend to use it as a word that merely refers to consciousness (for example, when Dennett uses it, he denotes the 'what it's like' character of being sentient). As we both know, Phenomenology is not restricted to phenomenology, hence the capitalisation.   I understand why it seemed that I was equivocating in the first part of my comment; I was deliberately using Phenomenology in the broadest sense of the term - when one does so, one inevitably covers a lot of ground, opening the way for ambiguity. Nonetheless, I took care to associate certain threads with Phenomenology with certain Phenomenologists (e.g., Merleau-Ponty's prizing of descriptiveness over explanation).   The conventional view is that Husserl was indeed a Cartesian - or at  least came very close to being one; however, I highly recommend reading the work of Dan Zahavi, a philosopher who has done a lot of revisionist work on Husserl, based on Husserl's previously unpublished manuscripts (cf. Zahavi's Husserl's Phenonenology, 2003). Zahavi examines Husserl's development from idealism to concrete topics such as embodiment, intersubjectivity, time and the lebenswelt. (We can discuss this in further detail if you wish).   You note that there are probably three main kinds of Phenomenology. What, in your view, are these three kinds? (I. Cartesian, II. Existential, III. Hermeneutic - ?)  Re: subjective states. Insofar as the world is soaked with subjectivity, we are not operating in a world that is completely independent of our minds. Yes, a lot of the world can be intact in the absence of perceivers - no buildings would instantly collapse if every animal instantly died - but a lot of the world is dependent on the relational aspects of subjectivity and culture; perception creates meaningful spaces. As Sartre wrote in Being and Nothingness,  ""[B]eing is not situated in relation to locations by means of degrees of longitude and latitude. He [Pierre, Sartre's fictional man] is situated in human space."" (p. 303). Human space is inescapably subjective in a way that objective measurements are not. I take this to be a fairly trivial point.   Re: presupposing the subject-object ontology - yes, I have, which leads me to think a). I should probably read more Heidegger ;) and b). to question whether it really is such a bad presupposition to make: after all, we can still be individuated subjectivities, retaining a sense of meinheit, without necessarily being Cartesian egos."

The methods to enforce citizens behaving streamlined worked in higher developed countries of the pact of Warsaw like the GDR and the late USSR by materialistic rewards or punishments. It was the same strategy like in the Mc Carthy era. those who weren't streamlined got on black lists, which made it impossible to get better jobs.  The imprisonment of opposition figures wasn't unusual, but again it showed similarities with the West when communists were prosecuted for crimes they couldn't have done or crimes especially defined for communists like in Western Germany.  Countries like Spain had even death commandos for leftists until the 1990s and and is accused to provide practices of torture.

This war lasted until 1923 and was bloody on all sides. So far  nothing new.   The industrialization of the USSR with all their victims not just in the gulags, but by the working conditions too are usual for nations doing a catch-up development. And Stalin created a well known ideological base for this, by enforcing Russian nationalism like in capitalistic nations.   The nations of the pact of Warsaw were just victims of cold war, because the USSR simply exaggerated the experience from the civil war and created a buffer.   Your accusation of open ideology has a hole different background. You are defining communism as ideology and your own political environment as ideology free, which is hilarious.

Althusser was something of a committed Communist so I'm not sure what he'd have to say on the subject, but while the Soviet Union did have a strong ""public"" ideology, it's ""real"" ideology was something very different. You have to look at the real ideology when you are judging these things.   While Soviet Communism pretended to be something new, in reality it was just a collection of past practices taken to new extremes. The Gulags existed under the Tsar, they were expanded; the secret police, the army, the authoritarian rule, all of it is pure Russia and there's a very ancient ideology to it all. And when Soviets got into trouble they were not reluctant to steal ideas and of course ideology from the western capitalist states.   Look at China today for an example.

philosophy,3c7pud,eileenwright,-9,Tue Jul 7 05:13:38 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, communist states are operating on a relatively new concept created practically from whole cloth by pseudo-philosophers Engels and Marx. Capitalism is just the logical evolution of the historical trajectory of successful forms of government over the millennia and embracing the (very general) ideas of freedom of citizens coupled with the responsibilities those freedoms require. And so, in that context, it is more ""natural"" than some vague trust that you will do your job if I just do mine.  Freedom implies the freedom to possess the product of your industry. But if I make tables, I can only possess so many tables so I must then be able to trade some of those possessions for other, more practical and diverse possessions which I then own. It's but a conceptual step to substitute money for the excess goods.  None of which is to say that capitalist/democratic states don't develop (or encourage or tolerate) autonomous organizations which provide psychological validation and underpinning for the status quo.  But as I said in my OP; what alternative is there? The citizen has just as much vested interest in supporting a state which provides him/her with a relatively safe and stable environment in which to pursue life, liberty, and happiness, as the state has in its own perpetuation.  Common sense, true common sense is, one needs to provide for the basic survival necessities. All else is the pursuit of higher goals, emotional (pleasure) rewards.  It is a settled verity that communal states fail because human nature (yep, there's such a thing), like necessity, is the mother of invention (or industry). If there is no need for me to be productive in order to have all my needs met, there is a very high likelihood that I will do nothing."

Where the ideology comes in is when people believe that having and producing stuff is not a tool to achieve certain ends, but the actual end. People  work simply to produce more profit to spend the profits on more stuff and that's all their lives have become.   It also becomes an ideology when people apply market principles to other aspects of life that were organized by other values before.

This means that a Capitalist has the money to both buy the means of production (tools, workplace, material) and the labour power of the worker, to produce a commodity which he then sells for more money than it took to create that commodity. Thus the rate of profit is the rate of exploitation of the worker being not paid the value of their labour. (Market) Socialism is the idea of having a democracy in the workplace, where the fruits of labour as well as the decision making of the productive process are controlled democratically by the workers themselves, who share in the profits on a much more egalitarian basis.

This division of labour leads to class structures. Marx recognized that how a society distributes it's 'surplus' created by its economic base often shapes the entire social structure and it's self-legitimizing ideology (false consciousness if that ideology is that of the ruling class). These material relations often shape how humans think and behave due to a process of social construction within whatever productive framework (which often evolves over time).

Here we could ask a similar question: is the stone ‘computing’ the answer to a calculus equation that describes its flight, or is calculus just a convenient way of describing its trajectory?   This actually lets us make the distinction much clearer: calculus describes the trajectory, and the trajectory of a stone can't describe anything other the trajectory of the stone.  So the calculus involves operations over real numbers and continuous space, which are technically uncomputable in the general case, and the stone itself doesn't allow any implementation of universal computation (viz: universal Turing machines or untyped lambda calculus).  The brain, on the other hand, must at least be capable of encoding any arbitrary computation, because we can plainly use the brain to write down arbitrary computations and run them out with a pencil and paper.  It must be able to compute; proof by trivial demonstration.  The question, then, is whether some computational model describes the brain arbitrarily well as our experimental data gets better.  And the answer is that, as far as we know, yes, cognitive science broadly works.  As a research program, it has born fruit to add to our understanding of how pre-verbal psychology operates.  If one argument, such as that of David Chalmers, defies the consilience of the entire rest of reality and our knowledge thereof, then the argument is probably just wrong (in fact, I would say that Chalmers' specific p-zombie-based arguments beg their question)."

As users and even as programmers of PC's, it's easy to take for granted the fact that the machines themselves that we use to view and manipulate words and sounds and pictures do not themselves need those very words and sounds and pictures to do what they do.

That's funny, because as far as I know, ""the concept of intelligence"" as employed in ""artificial intelligence"" (a misnomer and a failure of a field if I've ever heard one!) doesn't really exist.  The modus operandi of ""AI"" research is to simply point out some behavioral or inferential task that humans can perform which we do not yet know how to make a machine do, then teach the machine to somehow do it, and then publish and ask for more grants.  The standard concept used in artificial general intelligence research is only a little better: maximization of expected utility or reward (for arbitrary computable VNM-rational utility functions) in arbitrary (but stepwise-computable/coinductively productive) environments.  Only the second even gives you a loose idea of what actual cognitive activities are involved in ""intelligent"" imagining, inference, or decision making.  And it's a pretty loose idea!   It is based on the utterly defunct notion of a disembodied rationality that no longer has the support of most psychologists and many philosophers, two disciplines that increasingly see emotion as an inherent part of cognition, not merely as a potential disrupter.    Cartesian, disembodied rationality is also considered a failed approach in AI, since people realized they don't want their robots to fall down the stairs and smash their own hardware into little pieces.  But further, just because failed approaches to AI are, you know, failed, doesn't mean you can just say, ""Well it must be the opposite of that!"" and be doing good cognitive science.  That would require AI professors to be extraordinarily lucky, a Diabolus Ex Machina in which they actually deeply understand the mind but always do the opposite of the right thing.  In fact, most often, the ""opposite of that"" isn't even well-defined.  So saying, ""emotion is an inherent part of [human] cognition"" is a correct statement that also tells you absolutely nothing about how emotion participates in cognition, about what is actually going on, except that it's not Cartesian, disembodied, emotionless, Straw Vulcan ""rationality"".

Obviously if you believe in souls my argument does not apply, but I did mention that.   2) the physicists are themselves human, if their behaviour is entailed by the laws they use, then they would be able to, in principle, predict their own behaviour, but this can be shown to be inconsistent with the assumptions of empirical science, including physics   If you are talking about general psychology then that's irrelevant to what I'm talking about unless the psychologist is an omnipotent computer running a simulation of the entire universe.  If you are talking about the incompleteness principle, that doesn't apply here because the machine isn't emulating itself, it's emulating strictly other machines in simulated universes so it's not an inconsistency problem.  If you are talking about the non-determinism inherent to quantum mechanics, this is a more interesting objection, but a Quantum-UTM can emulate any quantum system, including the universe, and a UTM can emulate a Q-UTM (albeit exponentially slowly).   3) laws of physics are mathematical abstractions that allow us to predict what will follow if we perform certain actions, this allows us to control, to some extent, our environment, this seems to be incompatible with the notion that it's actually the environment that controls us,   This is vague enough that I have no idea what you are actually claiming.  However, I'm making no claim about whether or not we are controlling or controlled by our environment.   My claim is very simple, I'll reiterate it below.   4)  laws of physics apply to a small range of phenomena when dealt with by a small range of methods, they tell us nothing about what is outside those ranges.    Regardless of whether or not science has actually discovered the mechanisms describing the function of the universe at a subatomic level %100, there is absolutely no reason to believe that no such mechanisms exist:  Put another way, our personal uncertainty about the laws doesn't imply that the universe could not be simulated on a turing machine.

If the reader believes that the brain is purely material with no supernatural components (e.g, that it is built out of the structures of the laws of physics like particles and chemistry and electromagnetism and gravity), then the question of whether or not a UTM can emulate a human brain reduces to whether or not a UTM can emulate particles and chemistry and electromagnetism.    The belief in the materialism of the brain is likely unless the reader is religious, but given my audience (/r/philosophy on reddit.com) I find that to be unlikely.  It's a fairly obvious assumption.  The question of the ability of a UTM to emulate physics, then, is in turn a question of whether or not the laws of physics 1) exist and ar consistent 2) are computable.     Again, most readers should find the claim that the universe operates according to consistent fundamental principles fairly obvious, as it is the claim that supports all of science as a philosophical pursuit.    Whether those principles are computable is a tougher question, but considering every law we've discovered so far required to simulate the universe is very very obviously computable, and that the space of non-computable functions seems to be limited to strange mathematical oddities (like the halting problem or komolgorov complexity) that don't really map to anything we observe in the universe, it seems likely to me that whatever laws we haven't discovered yet are computable.     I'm willing to concede that, yes, my argument falls apart if we eventually learn something bizarre like that the reason why we observe wavefunction collapse is because electrons somehow solve the halting problem...but I find that as unlikely as ghosts existing.  So, in summary, brains are made up of particles and work by following the known and unknown laws of physics, so emulating a brain can be done by emulating the known and unknown laws of physics.   Emulating the known and unknown laws of physics can be done if the known and unknown laws of physics are computable, and all the known laws are, and the prospects of unknown uncomputable laws of physics is so outside the realm of what we expect to find that it's absurd.    Therefore, yes, a non-religious person who believes in science as a worthwhile pursuit of knowledge is pretty much forced to accept that a UTM can emulate a human brain by simulation of the physics of the universe."

Nature is computable because the 99.9% of nature that we currently understand is computable, and because we know that everything uncomputable is completely unlike anything we've ever seen in nature, it is unlikely to appear in the 0.001% of the natural laws of physics that we do NOT understand.   dditionally, last I checked, the question of the computability of nature was an open question, but you describe it as a settled conclusion that the scientific community is forced to accept   Yes I do.

If you're defining the supernatural as that which is independent of laws of physics, then the supernatural clearly exists, as there are many things that are independent of laws of physics. But very many people reject the existence of the supernatural, so you seem to have an eccentric definition.    the physicists are themselves human, if their behaviour is entailed by the laws they use, then they would be able to, in principle, predict their own behaviour, but this can be shown to be inconsistent with the assumptions of empirical science, including physics   If you are talking about general psychology then that's irrelevant to what I'm talking about unless the psychologist is an omnipotent computer running a simulation of the entire universe.    I am, as I clearly stated, talking about physicists and physics, because you have stated that your claim is limited to laws of physics.   Physics is an empirical science, this means that it's a practice of human beings in which they, inter alia, make an accurately record observations. For example, if a physicist observes a value of minus one, they cannot perform empirical science if they record this observation as ""plus one"". Further, methods of recording are arbitrary, we can assign any symbol or method to the values of interest. Given the above, if we assume a complete ""physics"" in which the physicist has all the laws of physics, a fully accurate description of the universe of interest and the computing power to predict how the system will evolve, then, if the world is fully predictable by laws of physics, the physicist can predict which they themself will say earlier, after viewing the result of the computed prediction: ""yes"" or ""no"". But the physicist can set as their recording procedure: in the case that ""no"" is predicted, record this by immediately saying ""yes"", and in the case that ""yes"" is predicted, record this by immediately saying ""no"". So, for any empirical science to have laws that entail all behaviour of human beings, entails that empirical science is impossible. Accordingly, neither physics nor any other science has laws that could fully describe human behaviour but if brains were computers, then some science could fully describe human behaviour, therefore, brains are not computers.   . . . our personal uncertainty about the laws doesn't imply that the universe could not be simulated on a turing machine. There is no reason to believe that it cannot (unless you believe in the supernatural).   Laws of physics are statements made by physicists and some of those statements describe a continuous universe, that is a universe in which there are things that have a zero probability of being computable. So, either the physicists are radically mistaken with their models or your contention is false; we have reasons, arising directly from physics, that ""imply that the universe could not be simulated on a Turing machine"", and this does not appear to commit us to the supernatural, excepting your above eccentric implicit definition.   most readers should find the claim that the universe operates according to consistent fundamental principles fairly obvious, as it is the claim that supports all of science as a philosophical pursuit    For science to be useful, occasional regularities seem to be suffice.   a non-religious person who believes in science as a worthwhile pursuit of knowledge is pretty much forced to accept that a UTM can emulate a human brain by simulation of the physics of the universe    I'm an atheist and I think that science is a worthwhile pursuit, though I don't think it generates knowledge, but I think computational theory of mind is completely implausible.

There are many physical properties or laws that could imply the uncomputability of the universe that don't imply the existence of the soul.  For example, if some unknown feature of string theory or something created an oracle for the halting problem, then that would provide no evidence for the soul but would imply the uncomputablity of the universe.

In computer-scientific terms, mostly no.  In fact, if stochasticity couldn't be emulated on a deterministic machine with a source of random bits, we couldn't write machine-learning algorithms and run them on serial, deterministic office computers.  It's a matter not of which computations are possible, given unlimited hardware, but of which are easy given specific hardware.  Desktop computers are built to run serial, deterministic computations with no errors whatsoever (where possible).  Precisely for that reason (of requiring near-total precision and accuracy), they are difficult to make and consume a lot of energy to run.  Stochastic hardware, on the other hand, yields approximate answers to inherently statistical questions.  It tolerates errors quite easily, because a small perturbation of a stochastic process will mostly only yield a small perturbation in the inferred outputs.  Stochastic hardware is thus comparatively cheap to assemble and can run with very little energy, because it tolerates minor environmental variations instead of spending energy to prevent them.  Stochastic hardware can also be parallelized very easily, since every conditional independence in a probabilistic model allows for parallel evaluation/sampling/inference of the component distributions.  Now, what sort of natural device acts like stochastic computing hardware?  Neurons!  In fact, get a bunch of neuron-ish thingies together, freely vary the ways they update their physical connections, and you've got a cheaply assembled, low-energy, massively parallel implementation of vast varieties of neural-network learning models.  Notably, in computing theory, a sufficiently large, deep neural network is also a ""universal approximator"", capable of learning (given sufficiently much training data) any circuit (any computation, more or less) that fits inside its size (in number of neurons and synapses), so as a computing device that learns from noisy data, a neural network can learn anything under a certain size at all.  The question is just how quickly (in terms of necessary time for processing, and necessary training data to learn the right thing).  Precisely which sort of neural network is the human brain?  Well, different sections of the brain may well implement different sorts of learning and inference behaviors entirely: neural behavior can vary sufficiently widely for different bits to do different things.  Even when you restrict yourself to the neocortex, believed to be the seat of ""joined-up thinking"", there are a variety of extent theories.  Also, there are a couple of domains in which stochasticity is secret sauce in mathematically interesting ways, in that treating probability and statistics as our basic method for reasoning allows us to address problems we had considered unsolvable (in these two cases: the Continuum Hypothesis and the Halting Problem)."

The conclusion become: If giving a tennis lesson solely for money is always wrong, then giving a tennis lesson solely for pleasure is always wrong.  More generally, this observation can be extended to any exchange (at least between humans)."

I don't know that Pruss makes this supposition here, though.   The conclusion become: If giving a tennis lesson solely for money is always wrong, then giving a tennis lesson solely for pleasure is always wrong.   I think Pruss could happily concede that this is true. The difference is that most people are perfectly fine with both tennis lessons solely for money and tennis lessons solely for pleasure, while plenty of people think that prostitution is wrong, but are fine with sex purely for pleasure. Therefore, the tennis case just isn't as interesting as the prostitution case. If you show that sex for pleasure is wrong if prostitution is wrong, then you've shown that a commonly held set of opinions (""Prostitution is wrong"" + ""Sex purely for pleasure is OK"") is incoherent, whereas this is not true for the tennis case (because, again, not a lot of people have a problem with taking money for tennis lessons)."

From my understanding, the premise of the argument is that some people who have sex for money are ultimately having sex for pleasure, the conclusion being that if having sex for money is wrong, then having sex for pleasure is wrong. But knowing that some instances of having sex for pleasure are wrong doesn't say anything about the moral character of people who are having sex for pleasure but not for money. A quantifiable logic problem with such a premise and conclusion turns up invalid.  That isn't to say that prostitution is wrong, but I don't think this argument can suggest that it isn't, or that its wrongness affects the moral standing of sex for pleasure as a whole."

Under his formulation, the individual in question is having sex purely for the money, and their only enjoyment comes from whatever you spend that money on, not from the sex at all. He is comparing that to anyone else who has sex for pleasure.   Now, I think most people would agree that everyone has sex for the sake of pleasure. The issue is that you can still have sex for pleasure in different ways; you can be having sex with the goal of mutual pleasure, because you are in fact concerned with your partner as an end in themselves. Or you can be having sex for only your own selfish pleasure, with no concern for your partner, treating them as nothing more than a means to your own gratification.   Now, I think it's clear that the example of ""having sex to earn money to spend on yourself"", especially in the example he's given is an example of the latter; based on selfish, rather than mutual pleasure rather than shared. That isn't to say that it is totally immoral, but there is a moral difference between that and activity based on people being treated as ends rather than means."

The demands for sex are in the range from asexual to 2 times a day. Some people consider the freedom to choose a partner every day higher than a stable relationship and we won't change that anyway. Such formalisms aren't important to nowadays  life. In some countries of Europe the first sex happens on a average with 14 and they changing partners fast.

philosophy,3ca5vm,fencerman,2,Wed Jul 8 21:17:31 2015 UTC,"The attribute selfish can be put on sex allways   That's not the case at all - you're failing to distinguish self-fulfillment in the context of mutual fulfillment, where there is a concern for others, and pure self-fulfillment while ignoring the fulfillment of others. There is a fundamental difference between aiming for MUTUAL pleasure and happiness, versus aiming for purely SELFISH pleasure and happiness. It fundamentally changes the relationship between the people and the act itself.   These are basic moral distinctions; I'm not saying that it is unacceptable to have sex for selfish reasons ever, but there is absolutely a moral distinction between the two cases.   As for sex for money versus working for money; again, I'm not saying either one is fundamentally wrong, but they are morally not the same as sex for mutual fulfillment. Most work in a capitalist society involves treating people as a a means and using them for your own purposes to some degree or another, but that doesn't make it ""good"", only ""acceptable"".    Such categories doesn't mean much to me. The demands for sex are in the range from asexual to 2 times a day. Some people consider the freedom to choose a partner every day higher than a stable relationship and we won't change that anyway.   That's irrelevant to what I'm talking about - I don't care if you screw 10 or 20 people a day.

The participants came into the experiment with their experiences from a social environment which provides them with a standard repertoire of decisions and reactions   As far as I remember the roles was randomized, everybody had psychological checks done to make sure they were all well-functioning individuals (i.e. no psychopaths). It seems like too big a coincidence that all the subjects that had latent sadistic traits where all put in the guard group.   I would make the claim that humans are used to a certain social environment and don't change their behavior rapidly   Zimbardos research was inspired by the Stanley Milgrim experiment, in which the subjects think they electrocute a person until the person is unconscious (or worse), I believe it was 2/3 that went all the way. That two out of three people would attempt murder, because someone could not remember a correct sequence of words, is not something you would see under normal circumstances. This shows that to some degree that behavior can change quite rapidly.   Part of Zimbardos conclusions is that this progress can be vastly accelerated by dehumanizing both the guards and prisoners, uniforms and shades to the guards, calling the prisoners by numbers instead of their names etc. His point was also that assumed roles can apply as much pressure as outside influences.    the problem of such an experiment   Zimbardo also argues that it was the exact same process that let to Abu Ghraib.

Like it or not, public intellectuals like Sam Harris are ""practicing philosophers"" regardless of their level of competence. And like it or not, academic philosophers often do not engage with public intellectuals for exactly the same reason that scientists don't engage with public intellectuals: their level of competence is usually quite low. Now, what does ""engage"" mean? It doesn't mean ""was nice enough to respond to my emails"" or other anecdotal crap like some posters below are suggesting. It means ""enters into public debate with"". Like most successful public intellectuals Sam Harris has 10,000 times more readers than the average academic philosopher, and those readers think they are reading legitimate philosophy.

Obviously anecdotes are not data and probably some philosopher somewhere has refused to discuss some issue with someone merely because they lack formal training, but it's almost certainly not as widespread as you seem to think.  It's true that a lot of the philosophers on reddit appear to have short tempers and are unwilling to discuss some philosophical issues with some people, but that's often because those people are quite intellectually arrogant and persistently misunderstand views and arguments they want to disagree with, while offering a shoddy articulation and defense of their own views which they refuse to recognize as such even though it has been repeatedly pointed out (and usually while insulting the intelligence of that philosopher!).

Likewise a philosophy degree signals that you have read and comprehended a lot of philosophy and won't respond to my paper on the metaphysical grounding of Kantian ethics by explaining that the greatest happiness for the greatest number is what matters.   As for why philosophers use jargon there are two reasons. First, it allows brevity when talking to other academics. Second, often our language has trouble expressing philosophical ideas so a philosopher will create a new word to express their meaning.  I don't know if philosophy had a Feynman but Michael Sandel's Justice is a reasonable introduction to some of the main ethical traditions. Another good option is the A Very Short Introduction series.

This is more of a damning confession than it is an excuse.  As a historian, and a historian of religion, I can't tell you how many times I've been asked the same questions. 'How do we know Jesus existed?', 'Did people really believe in all of those gods?', and so on. That's not annoying, and I always give it my time (as do other academics) for a number of reasons, which are not in order of importance here. First, I'm employed by a university, and in my country universities are funded by the taxpayers and the students. So, I'm employed by the people on the street, and I have an ethical responsibility to answer the questions they're interested in, not the ones I am, and to get the information out to them, not hide it in jargon or purely academic debate. That leads on to my second point: because I have a primary responsibility to the public, these questions in their repetition and similarity are extremely useful in dictating what questions I should be asking of the evidence (in my field, which is history), and gauging how well I've disseminated my research.  Then there's the basic respect for human intellect. Sure, the initial question might be the same, but after that the discussions diverge. I've found more useful ideas from my discussions with the public - from Catholic priests to children (if you'll excuse the association) - than I have from discussions with other academics. (Academic feedback is useful in other ways). They aren't constrained by the same assumptions about approach and disciplines and so on. Immediately precluding further discussion by using jargon or just brushing off the question just means that the field stagnates.   Most importantly, who are you to determine what a legitimate response is to your paper? People respond from different perspectives, and it's your job as an academic philosopher to engage with those perspectives, not respond to them with scorn. I've had people respond to my research by calling it unethical and even evil, and if I can engage with those people, you can damn well engage with someone who responds like that. This betrays that famous haughty attitude of academic philosophers, in which they consider themselves the ultimate arbiters of everything."

That's the standard that all academic work is held to (at least in Europe). And trust me, what you're (in a nonspecific sense obviously) studying in philosophy is more explicable than many of the research projects that I've seen. So, though it isn't an answer to your question, the first reply would be: because that's the way it is for everyone. Those are the rules, so you need to obey them or risk being shut down. If you want to sit in your ivory tower then it needs to be an ivory tower of your own making, because that sort of isolationist behaviour has no place in the academic world.  From a more philosophical perspective, thinking about why they're the rules, and whether they should be, there are a number of reasons in addition to my (sufficient) remarks above about us all actually being on the payroll of the public (which is also broadly true in the USA too). No one owns information, and research is a collaborative global effort. Keeping that information restricted to a select few is socially damaging and hierarchical, and it's entirely unfair. Should bricklayers only lay bricks for other builders? Shop keepers only sell to other retail workers? No, this is all part of the collective global civilisation, so philosophy needs to scrap the superior attitude. It's not just about the information we obtain, discover, or create, but about the methods we use. Those methods have to be geared towards finding information that the public want to know: the questions we ask, and the terms of the discourse, not just the answers, need to be determined by the public. It's the job of the researcher to find an academic language for those questions, and to find a way of answering them. It's not their job to ignore or dismiss the public, or even to tell them that they shouldn't be interested in X because Y is more important (which is the problem my subject has to confront)."

philosophy,3c4xaa,creepyforestguy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"I would say nonacademic philosophers often run the risk of ""low-theory,"" or ""pedestrian"" theory--looking for an answer, or a call to action as opposed to just absorbing, and applying the philosophical concepts that came prior. I'm not necessarily opposed to low-theory; I've been working through Situationist stuff myself, I'm working on getting petitions signed, I believe in some form of direct-action--but nonetheless, its significantly different than Spinoza, and Marx--there's no real call to action in their material, but a way of perceiving the world/society/people.   I think the difference, for the Academic, is we are only looking to clarify, extend, and expound our philosophical meanderings--to uphold a conversation. So, I think there is a divorce between the person interested in philosophy, and the person who is actively studying it, and applying it critically (I admit, I'm an English major myself, but I read primarily critical texts; always applying philosophy).    I'm not saying this is a problem, just a difference. I think everyone should be toying with abstract concepts, and I invite everyone to try their hand at it. But it does take work in the form of reading and writing--a motivation to be auto-didactic."

I haven't read a lot of Chomsky but manufacturing consent was a really good read.   This debate is horrible though.  Besides the huge language barrier between the two,  they also hail from fairly different schools of thought (Foucault from French structuralism with a hint of phenomenology while Chomsky comes from a British - American analytic philosophy /linguistic tradition aka Max Black, J. L. Austin and others.) which makes it hard for them to communicate at a conceptual level in a conversational setting.

philosophy,3c32jb,interiorlittlevenice,-5,Sat Jul 4 22:17:12 2015 UTC,"I think the fact that modern anthropology is still so wedded to the concept of no human nature/a blank slate is more an indictment of the way the field ebbs and flows with the political fashion of the time, instead of any kind of scientific conclusion.  Let us not forget that the prevailing anthropological truths of the 1890s or 1930s were just as attached to the popular opinions of the era.    Cultural anthropologists like to argue that because most evolutionary psychology consists of just-so stories (also known as hypotheses, but that's an argument for another day), that the field is basically a cover for 'scientific' racism and sexism, which is partially true.   They go wrong, however, when they declare that because a lot of evolutionary psychology cannot be objectively proven (forgetting the same is true for much of modern anthropology in academia) that human nature does not exist.   This is surely a ridiculous position for any academic to take.  The veracity of a given hypothesis does not depend on whether it can be proven, and indeed science is littered with examples of theories proven correct decades or even centuries after their conception.  On a greater level, the argument is fallacious in another way- is theology pointless as a field because the existence of a deity may not be proven?  Even if there is no such thing as human nature, the study of proving or disproving that notion is worth time and effort.    My big problem with anthropology is that it has become deeply political.  In the same way a racist might seek to prove a racial hierarchy of intelligence to justify his beliefs, so too is the belief in a blank slate unquestioned (or rarely questioned) in CA because it means that humans can be culturally molded to do or believe in anything, which justifies the (frequently radical left wing) movements of social transformation many anthropologists believe in."

philosophy,3c2dg9,amorfati89,2,Sun Jul 5 00:23:08 2015 UTC,"Abstracting from production value, these are a little better, but there are still some pretty serious defects.  “Introduction to Kierkegaard: The Existential Problem” rightly emphasizes Kierkegaard’s use of indirect communication. However, it fails to explain Kierkegaard’s chief purpose in using this maieutical method: his reintroduction of true Christianity into self-deluded bourgeois Christendom. Moreover, it omits any discussion of the relationship between indirect communication and irony—a central concept in Kierkegaard, and one on which he even wrote his dissertation.  There is eventual mention of Kierkegaard’s use of pseudonyms, but up to that point the video simply quotes the pseudonymous works as though the views contained therein are Kierkegaard’s own. (Specifically, it quotes Fear and Trembling, The Concept of Anxiety, Concluding Unscientific Postscript, and The Sickness Unto Death.)  What’s more, it does not indicate that the pseudonymous works make up only one side of Kierkegaard’s total authorship. There is no mention at all of Two Ages: A Literary Review, For Self-Examination, Works of Love, The Moment, The Point of View, or any of Kierkegaard’s many “upbuilding discourses.”  The video observes that “Kierkegaard was passionately committed to the idea that everyone must walk the path to selfhood as a solitary or ‘single individual’.” Here it would be helpful to stress that he was not therefore proposing a gross individualism, and that ‘the crowd’ is to be distinguished from genuine community: “Contemporaneity with actual persons, each of whom is someone, in the actuality of the moment and the actual situation gives support to the single individual. But the existence of a public creates no situation and no community” (Two Ages, p. 91; cf. JP 3: 2952).  The second video, “Introduction to Kierkegaard: The Religious Solution,” continues, with one brief exception, to refuse Kierkegaard his wish that we cite the pseudonyms when quoting the pseudonymous works. It also repeatedly mispronounces “aesthete.”  The treatment of Kierkegaard’s three stages is okay but could be improved, and the video fails to note that for Kierkegaard not just any faith will do. The distinction between immanental religiousness (which we find in ancient Greek paganism) and paradoxical religiousness (which we find in Christianity’s doctrine of the Incarnation) is omitted, and there is no discussion of Kierkegaard’s ethic of divinely commanded neighbor-love (see Works of Love) or his trenchant critique of the State church (see especially Practice in Christianity and The Moment and Late Writings).  Lastly, the video unfairly decontextualizes Kierkegaard from his philosophical, socio-cultural, and literary context. One should not, of course, engage in The School of Life’s dubious biographizing, but that doesn’t mean we need to cut Kierkegaard out of history altogether."
philosophy,3c2dg9,amorfati89,3,Sat Jul 4 19:10:28 2015 UTC,"You obviously have extensive knowledge of Kierkegaard and have studied his ideas for a long time. That being said, I disagree that there are ""serious defects"" in the videos. The point of the videos is not to scrupulously investigate the fine details of his ideas, but to provide a general introduction. And as a general introduction they accurately cover many of his main ideas, providing a platform for the viewer to investigate Kierkegaard's works on their own. Therefore in my opinion they fulfill their purpose extremely well. To be honest I think your analysis/criticisms are much better suited for a PhD thesis than a 10 minute introductory video.  A 10-15 minute introductory video on any philosopher will inevitably gloss over some of the nuances and details of their thought, no matter how well researched it is (and I think the aforementioned videos are extremely well researched). I think your conclusion that they are seriously defective is misplaced and unfair, and is a conclusion founded upon a misunderstanding of the purpose of the videos as well as the inescapable limits which such a form of communication confronts.

Given the length at which the creator of the video treats ideas that are mainly confined to The Concept of Anxiety and The Sickness Unto Death, would it have really taken much effort to treat ideas that are even more central to Kierkegaard (such as irony), to give some historical context (as even The School of Life’s video does), or to simply acknowledge that there were two main streams of S.K.’s authorship (signed and pseudonymous)? Would any of this would have required that the video “scrupulously investigate the fine details of his ideas,” or is that not in fact simply a non sequitur? And to ignore Kierkegaard’s repeated request that he not be conflated with his pseudonyms, which, as he himself points out, is “so easy to comply [to] that I feel one should have no objection to indulging me in this” (JP 6: 6567)—how is that not a serious (though easily rectifiable) defect?   A 10-15 minute introductory video on any philosopher will inevitably gloss over some of the nuances and details of their thought, no matter how well researched it is (and I think the aforementioned videos are extremely well researched).   Not all of my objections pertain to “the nuances and details,” and some of them could be met by the addition of just a sentence or two.   I think your conclusion that they are seriously defective is misplaced and unfair, and is a conclusion founded upon a misunderstanding of the purpose of the videos as well as the inescapable limits which such a form of communication confronts.   Such limits may mitigate some of the less central issues I have pointed out, but surely they do not exculpate one from failing to observe Kierkegaard’s main purpose in writing, and I really don’t think they prevent consistently acknowledging Kierkegaardian pseudonymity, registering the existence of the nonpseudonymous works, etc."

I agree the videos could be improved! That is obvious. I merely was responding to your criticism that they are seriously defective, which I don't think they are. With respect to the pseudonyms, the first video does in fact acknowledge Kierkegaard's claim that ""...in the pseudonymous works there is not a single word which is mine"", and therefore that there are two main streams of his authorship. In the second video when discussing the aesthetic and ethical stages the creator does not attribute the passages to Kierkegaard, but merely lists the work they are contained in.  With respect to your other criticisms in the paragraph quoted above, I agree that more consideration of irony would have been nice (the video does mention mastered irony), but given that so many core concepts are concisely explained in a manner that ties them all together, I think the video was extremely well done, and the few criticisms you have but minor issues and not serious defects as you claim.  But given your knowledge of Kierkegaard - you should make a video! Then you wouldn't have to criticize the others, as it would be so well done it would be the video people naturally gravitate to when they want to learn about Kierkegaard!"
philosophy,3c2dg9,safariG,2,Sun Jul 5 08:28:22 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between saying, without qualification, that a thing is “seriously defective,” and saying that it has certain serious defects—in other words, between an F or a D… and a C+.  Acknowledging Kierkegaard’s claim but then refusing to apply it in practice is inconsistent (and contrary to Kierkegaard’s own stress on exemplifying truth instead of just conveying it as information). Such a refusal also ignores Kierkegaard’s explicitly and repeatedly stated wish (and his reasons for it) when citing the pseudonymous works.  Furthermore, the video assumes that the content of the pseudonymous works is representatively “Kierkegaardian.” It does not so much as ask the question whether some of the content of Johannes de Silentio’s Fear and Trembling, for example, could be at odds with Kierkegaard’s own views. The intentional unreliability of the pseudonyms doesn’t even come up.  You may be right that the signed works are hinted at indirectly, but that does not tell us how many or how significant those signed works are.  Creating videos is not my forte, but I know what I would look for in an introductory piece. I am not claiming, as you said earlier, that such a video should “scrupulously investigate the fine details of his ideas.” Sure, if this were produced by a graduate student or a professor, I would perhaps give the video a C or C–. But if this is a person who is just beginning to study Kierkegaard, and has researched just a few of his works, I might give it a C+ or B–. (Unless, of course, he presented it while dressed up as Kierkegaard, and revoked it in Johannes Climacian fashion afterwards, which would earn a round of applause and a minor grade adjustment.)  Ideally, an introductory video would start off by acknowledging the daunting nature of approaching Kierkegaard. It would point out, at the very start, that Kierkegaard writes for the “single individual,” and writes in order to reintroduce Christianity into Christendom using a careful Socratic method. It would then, and not at the very end, distinguish the pseudonymous and signed works, briefly explaining their relationship. There would be passing reference to Hegel, to Regine Olsen, and to the Danish Lutheran Church—perhaps also to The Corsair. Emphasis on each of these could vary and still meet these reasonable requirements."

philosophy,3c4ek9,kittyblu,2,Sat Jul 4 17:52:24 2015 UTC,"To ask a question I had: I wasn't paying super close attention to the podcast while listening to it, so I'm wondering if May had a real objection to Dupree's intuition that certain kinds of pejoratives/all pejoratives are in some sense meaningless or are equivalent to saying jew plus hitting someone, metaphorically. He seemed to respond by restating his view, but I wasn't clear on how it responded to what Emily was saying."
philosophy,3c4ek9,Nimblestyx,2,Sun Jul 5 01:59:51 2015 UTC,"Dupree's intuition that certain kinds of pejoratives/all pejoratives are in some sense meaningless or are equivalent to saying jew plus hitting someone, metaphorically   This is my thought going in. I'll be on the lookout.   Edit   Okay, so Dupree's question occurs at 18:27-19:33. May responds by saying she's raised some different issues and lists three: 1) How do pejoratives get started? 2) What are people's intentions when they use pejoratives? 3) Why are pejoratives offensive?   He dismisses the third as beside the question, then asks whether what Dupree meant was that pejoratives ""don't have a truth value"". She agrees and adds that her intuition is that pejoratives don't have extensions. May then asks if she thinks the statement ""No Jews are kikes"" is true, ""yes or no?"" as an apparent counterexample. Dupree goes on to say she wants to say yes but also feels this is not the role pejoratives play in our language. May stops her and parses the issue into a linguistic side, a psychological side, sociological, and political. The linguistic side is about the ""meaning"" or ""conceptual structure"" of pejoratives while the other sides are about speakers' motives for using pejoratives, etc.   It doesn't seem to me like Dupree raised either of the three questions May listed, except maybe (2) on one reading. Instead it seems pretty straightforward that Dupree is offering a noncognitivist theory of pejorative meaning against May's 100% cognitivism (all part of May's ""linguistic"" side, which means the distinctions he made weren't really on target). May thinks calling someone a kike is making an entirely factual statement of the form ""X ought to be the target of negative moral evaluation simply because of X's membership of the group Jews"". Dupree's intuition is that ""kike"" at least has a noncognitivist or expressivist component which can't be captured by its literal content, so if it's not wholly noncognitive (i.e. without literal meaning) we at least need to be ""hybrid expressivists"" about it. (I'm just using terms I learned in my metaethics course.)   I hold this view of pejoratives, very unreflectively, which I picked up from some of David Copp's remarks in his paper on ""realist-expressivism"". Basically Copp thinks slurs work by asserting factual membership of some group and then adding some noncognitive con attitude like distaste or dislike, and he models his view of moral language on this view of slurs. Two thoughts: One, I think the cognitivist component is solid because it seems like responding to it is always appropriate (if someone calls me a nigger I can refute him by pointing out that I'm white). Two, I think it's important that the con attitude be thought of as grounded specifically in the group membership asserted in the literal content (calling someone a kike doesn't express a general dislike but a specific dislike due to her Jewishness).  But there's a question of whether May's moral content can play the part of Copp's/Dupree's noncognitive content. (Interestingly there could be no difference, depending on whether your theory of moral language is noncognitivist.) Here are some random thoughts:   Is ""some (not all) Jews are kikes"" even coherent? If May is right, how can some Jews but not others escape the negative moral desert in ""kike"" that's supposed to come entirely from their Jewishness? An empirical case: There's a common debate on 4chan over whether all black people are niggers or whether only some are. May would interpret this as a debate over whether all black people are black people who deserve negative moral evaluations simply because of their blackness, or whether some black people aren't. (IMO we should understand this with some implicit hyphenation; the question is not whether there are some black people who, despite their blackness, don't deserve negative moral evaluation on the whole -- the question is instead whether there are some black people who don't deserve some negative-moral-evalution-simply-because-of-their-blackness.) This sounds unintelligible. Not sure the hybrid expressivist theory avoids this problem. Does May's theory handle the existential claims (e.g. ""There's no such thing as a kike"") better? He seems to say it does around 24:45, but I'm not sure. On the hybrid expressivist view, someone calling someone else a kike is, say, expressing distaste towards that person for their membership of the group Jews. Isn't he then committed to the rationality or appropriateness of this distaste as grounded in that group membership? And can't we then understand the claim that there's no such thing as a kike as the universal denial of that appropriateness?   TL;DR   May doesn't answer the question. It's about whether a better theory would be ""hybrid expressivist"" instead of cognitivist, having both factual and noncognitive/expressive content. For example ""kike"" could mean ""Jew"" plus expressing disapproval based on that fact. Both theories have problems with statements like ""some (not all) Jews are kikes"". May seems to think the cognitivist view handles existential claims (e.g. ""There's no such thing as a kike"") better, but maybe not."

Ha, I guess that explains why I was confused at his response to her.   The hybrid-noncognitivist view tracks my intuitions. It just seems to me that the question ""do kikes exist?"" is malformed when construed as meaning ""does the set of kikes contain at least one member?"" and I don't think that ordinarily when we say that x exists or doesn't exist, we have to mean that. I think sometimes we mean that the concept of x is malformed, or simply that no one should be called ""x"" (but not on the basis that the set of x's is empty).  I think May's description of the meaning of ""kike"" is a good explanation of what the word does and furthermore it seems right, in most cases, to attribute a belief that someone* is worthy of denigration on the basis of being jewish to a person who uses the word ""kike"". But it seems weird to say that it means that. That's why the punch in the face part of the view that Dupree suggests seems so apt to me--slurs do something, which is akin to hitting someone, rather than merely say something. (I'm not familiar with how the term ""expressivism"" is used, so it's not clear to me that this would be an expressivist account of slurs per se.)  Putting those thoughts together, I think it is right to gloss ""do kikes exist"" as ""does anyone deserve to be denigrated on the basis of being jewish"", but not because ""kike"" means someone who deserves to be denigrated on the basis of being jewish. Rather ""kike"" is the denigration (which is not to say that it doesn't have some cognitive components, in that it implies that its basis is your jewishness), and the existential question is about whether the basis for denigration implies by ""kike"" is a good basis for the denigration that the word does. I think this is more-or-less what you're saying in the second bullet point, so yeah, I agree.  Re: 4chan case and coherence of ""some jews are kikes but not all"". I'm not certain that my? hybrid-noncognitivist views are not vulnerable to the same worries you raise as May's views are, so it seems worth responding to them.  First, I don't necessarily think it's bad if ""some jews are kikes but not all"" turns out to be incoherent or confused. This is because the people who do that ""well some x are x-slur but not all [and usually implied or outright stated:] therefore its not racist to use x-slur"" song-and-dance seem to me to be doing something objectionable, both on moral and perhaps theoretical grounds as well. I think a common reaction to the expression of this kind of view is, well, people get angry at the person who says it for being willfully obtuse about how ""kike"" or ""n-----""* are racial slurs, slurs directed at their race not just them as individuals or a member of a subset of their race. Not only is what they're doing morally objectionable, but they also willfully misunderstand the role those words play in our language in order to justify themselves. If they weren't willfully misunderstanding those words, then it would be clear to them that what they're saying is both incoherent and objectionable.  It also seems to me that (this is consistent with the above but maybe is a bit more neutral in spirit) the theory of slurs that's often articulated by people who hold the some x's are x-slurs view is either that to be rightly called an x-slur, you need to be a member of group x and possess certain objectionable qualities, or just that you're a member of group x, but the justifiability of calling you an x slur is defeasible (so if you're black, being black is usually sufficient, but if you're an exemplary black person, or a black person who acts white or whatever, then it wouldn't be right to call you a ""n-----""). (Wow I feel gross saying that.) So the 4channers have a different theory (philosophers are not the only people who can form theories about these sorts of things, after all) of slurs which causes them to use them in a certain (non-standard, it seems to me) way. Basically, we should interpret the 4channers as disagreeing with May at the level of theory, rather than an empirical data point.  *It's sufficient reason not to write or say a slur for me if the prevailing view among the group of people that a slur is used against is that they would prefer that it not be mentioned."

Not something I've thought that much about. It occurs to me it might have something to do with how masking words looks in writing. I've also felt awkward about using the phrase ""the N-word"" in conversation with black people, like I was being presumptuous about how easily hurt/offended they were. I remember a Django Unchained interview where Samuel L. Jackson refuses to answer a question about the use of the word ""nigger"" in the film because the interviewer won't say it.

I'm confused how you could get that from May's view, and even more confused about how it's the converse of that statement.  The anger of people who get angry about pejoratives is usually (it seems to me) at the implication that one is deserving of negative evaluation in virtue of one's group membership (so, the idea that it's a legitimate concept, given May's view about the meaning of ""kike"", etc.), or possible anger at the history of oppression that use of the term often seems to imply endorsement of and was used in, or possibly some other reason. It's not usually anger that one has been wrongly labeled as a member of a group that in fact exists. I would be more surprised if May's mother didn't react with anger to the use of the word ""kike"" than if she did not, and I would certainly be surprised if any significant proportion of people who are opposed to and angry about the use of racial pejoratives believe that the statement ""x is a [racial slur]"" is true of anyone (some, taking positions similar to Dupree's in the podcast, may think that the question of whether or not that statement is true doesn't even make sense). Furthermore, nothing seems contradictory about that position.  Take a different kind of example. Say x accuses y of belonging to a group of evil Jews that control the world (some people believe something like this). Surely it makes perfect sense for y to be angry at the accusation without them endorsing that there exists such a group of people.  In fact, I'm really baffled how you could say what you said at all, unless the point was to be uncharitable as possible to people who get angry at the use of pejoratives."

Rather, he seems to be defending himself against accusations (e.g. ""the charge that I, Mike, and maybe others don't have ""theories"" and therefore fail to give any explanation of why things are proceeding as they do"") by showing that looking at, and understanding, things through a theoretical framework does not guarantee meaningful results and if they do, according to this piece, in his experience, Chomsky does not find the theoretical framework necessary.  Chomsky never seems like he's rejecting an entire way of thinking, at least when I read him, he seems more charitable than that. Even with his political writings on Reagan, neoliberalism, or whatever, he simply presents a narrative and leaves a lot of the conclusion drawing to his readers. Anyway, that's what I got out of this piece, and my view on Chomsky is that, here, I think he's making a lot of sense.

The other, which explains why people wouldn't keep their word, is that people think other people are too different from them so they don't empathize with them. I think most people would stay quiet if the other was their mother. It would actually hurt them knowing they'd gotten their mom locked up.  So what separates the mother from a stranger? Hear me out here, but from discussions I've had, I think the answer is understanding how that person thinks and feels. When meeting a stranger both people are at first wary and both sense that from the other. But instead of interpreting it as 'oh he's acting just like I would I understand exactly' they assume it's because the other is a selfish jerk whose not to be trusted! Just because both people are afraid to say what they're really thinking for fear that the other isn't thinking like them.  I really feel this is how selfishness spreads. Little kids generally aren't automatically selfish to the point of knowingly causing harm to someone else for their own gain. It's only after they've been taken advantage of that they assume people are out to get them. Which causes them to take advantage of someone else.

philosophy,3c0e9w,jayjay091,0,Sat Jul 4 03:19:16 2015 UTC,"Didn't this thought experiment start as a way to justify governmental penalties in the first place?   Well, people often take the Prisoner's Dilemma to mean that, in order to get a good outcome for everyone, government must act against the maximal self-interest of individuals. My point is that, in skewing conditions away from reality, Prisoner's Dilemma promotes a false theory of what is actually in an individual's self-interest.  On what basis does the game exclude the creation of wealth by individual effort from considerations of self-interest? On what basis does it exclude interpersonal communication combined with calculations based on long-term self-interest? On what basis does the game exclude the possibility of a particular system of government from considerations of self-interest? (Even if you say that the game represents a contradiction specifically in anarchism, it is completely useless in determining which type of government to adopt. What kind of laws should the government adopt? What is the best way to resolve the contradiction? Which type of government is it in an individual's self-interest to support? Prisoner's Dilemma is too restricted and unrealistic a situation to tell you.)   One of the point is that, by forcing someone to do something they don't want to or by penalizing them if they don't do it, you can help them getting a better outcome.   This is related to discussions of the type of government that I mention above. When and how should the government ""force someone to do something they don't want to""? I would contend that it is only when they initiate force against other people, (or others' rightful property) and only to retaliate/punish on the person's behalf for the loss suffered. But this is a whole other issue that the Prisoner's Dilemma sheds absolutely no light on. Much more reality-based observations and arguments than Prisoner's Dilemma are required to settle that question, and the contradiction in anarchism can be expressed in much more realistic terms. Prisoner's Dilemma really is superfluous.  [Edit: ""anarchy"" to ""anarchism""]"

They use a model of groups that periodically compete, where the group members have a heritable trait to be either more selfish or more group-contributing.  Between rounds of competition, more selfish individuals gain more. But in the competitions, a group with more selfish members is more likely to lose and be eliminated. The more frequent competitions are, the more cooperativeness proliferates.  The really interesting question is, what should an individual do? It's still in your interest to be the selfish one and free-ride on the cooperative people in your group. If you look around and everyone else in your group is selfish, too, you might conclude that your group is not long for the world and look for a different one that you can exploit more safely.   The trick is that non-selfish contributions can include punishing or expelling selfish members. So if there is enough competitive pressure between groups, non-selfish punishers of selfish members can proliferate and sustain non-selfish cooperation. There is a related prisoner's dilemma strategy called strong reciprocation: cooperate with strong reciprocators, but defect against defectors and those who cooperate with defectors.  Sometimes I wonder if selfishness is now proliferating because most people are no longer subject to deadly competition between groups."

From that belief grew the idea that they can decide for themselves which groups, if any, they choose to identify with.

I'm not a biologist but I'd argue the following: Genetic makeup is much more diverse for humans allowing for us to not care about people outside of our families. Also, because we are capable of influencing other people in ways besides genetics (upbringing etc.) humans are not only focused on the survival of genetics but also the survival of memories of ourselves in others. Also, as environment plays a large role in humans, a human can reject people with a similar genetic makeup.

Inbreeding is so high in colonies because of the hierarchy and queen breeding that the success of the colony is way more important to the bee or ant than its own life. There are also many other animals that value friends and even adopt unrelated young. These animals would also factor the success of their friends in benefit/cost just like they would factor in relatedness of relatives.

philosophy,3bzxst,LaoTzusGymShoes,5,Fri Jul 3 23:55:19 2015 UTC,"Why is someone's preference for a particular sort of food more important than an animal's right to not be tortured for its entire existence and then killed?   First of all, nowhere in my statement did I specify that torturing an animal is morally acceptable, so let's keep the conversation relevant.  Not only is that directed more towards big agriculture/factory farming, but the question of torture is a conversation entirely rife with nuance that we should address only after determining if killing an animal is permissible at all.  To the point, the question is not whether it is ""right"" to eat animals, but whether it is morally permissible, and whether forbidding that morally permissible action is right.    Concerning moral permissibility, I subscribe to a contractarian (and by extension, a form of rights theory) model that includes individuals with potentiality (potentiality is another complex topic that I'm sure you'll ask about) for moral agency.  In basic terms, animals, even in the best possible scenarios, do not have potentiality for moral agency in the same manner that humans do, and therefore extending the social contract to inalienable right of life is unwarranted.  Under contractarian models, it is perfectly permissible to use organisms that are incapable of differentiating killing and murder as means to an end.  Of course, pain for the sake of pain is inexcusable, as is denying all moral status to animals whatsoever.  That said, the fact that animals cannot differentiate killing from murder makes the extended right to life unnecessary, and therefore the taking of their life morally permissible under nonsadistic circumstances.    The next question is, given that it is morally permissible, is it nonetheless justifiably legal to allow?  This question, however, is simpler to answer, once the proposal of rights to life are rejected.  Arguments I've heard fall usually into one of three categories: environmental concerns, health, or consideration of harm.   Environmental concerns is really only directed at big agricultural/factory farming practices (at least in any meaningful, significant way)—of which, I am also in opposition.  This, however, says nothing about the legality of meat consumption in and of itself, if done more conscientiously.   Health might be a concern if done in excess and primarily with red meat.  However, smoking, for all intents and purposes, is evidentially far greater a concern, yet we permit the individual the privilege to indulge nonetheless.  Clearly one's health is, to some extent beyond meat consumption, up to the individual to decide, not the law's.  Finally, the question of whether the interest in consumption of animals is sufficiently justifiable, since our current diet and food production does not demand meat to carry on survival.  The question is ultimately whether it is more important to preserve the animal's life or grant the individual an additional privilege.  However, if done in the least harmful way, it can be argued that this challenge actually begs the moral question.  And since it was established before that animals do not maintain the inalienable right to life, it becomes a question of preference as to whether the life is worth taking for the sake of eating.  After all, we kill spiders for emotional comfort, build houses over fox homes, cut down trees for the sake of space and lumber.  Such questions are up to how valuable the utility of the ends compared to the cost of the means.  Therefore, at such a point, I can argue that I find meat consumption pleasurable enough, that, if done in a conscientious way, is perfectly alright."

philosophy,3bzxst,yourlycantbsrs,3,Sat Jul 4 14:50:29 2015 UTC,"Imagine that the being with potential for moral agency never actually achieves it. Why does one get rights but not the other?   Actually, my position is that any well-established potentiality is sufficient reason to extend rights, even if that potentiality is never achieved.  For instance, an elderly person suffering from dementia was once a moral agent but may, perhaps be less capable of agency now.  The fact that this person fulfilled the contract and had the potentiality to fulfill it recognizes the right to life.   In a broader sense (and highly glossed over here), I define potentiality according to what I call the Circumstantial Distance of Potentiality for Moral Agency.  Namely, potentiality is measured inversely by how many adversarial circumstances need take place to prevent an entity from achieving potentiality.  Adversarial circumstances are those defined as events that directly inhibit the capacity for moral agency, where an entity would otherwise achieve it independently in a viable environment.    Therefore, infants and comatose patients have a relatively short circumstantial distance, they are within the bounds of reasonable potentiality.   Animals, even under no adversarial conditions, never achieve agency—in fact under this model they cannot even be considered as potential.  They lack all potentiality that humans (and other alien lifeforms capable of moral agency) have.    To put it simply: why value potentiality in situations where it's not expressed?   The reason for extending rights according to potentiality even if that potentiality is not achieved has to do with our interest in justice and empathy.  We recognize that our own situation is just one hard head-bump away from moral agency as well.  If we do not extend it to the potentials, we run the risk of losing it ourselves, or being incapable of extending it to those we love who lose the moral agency.    It's a form of collateral and our inherent desire to be fair that extends protections to those with potentiality.  Furthermore, none of us can see the future; if there's potentiality there, there's no telling what corrective event might take place to turn that potentiality into actuality.  Being so judicial about the unknown is unwarranted."

The reason I use this particular description is because it makes sense to me to correlate desire to the ""benefit"" and aversion to the ""harm"" the article mentions as what we must attempt and avoid, respectively, in regards to all sentient creatures.  If this is reasonable, then we define harm as that which a creature is averse to, in which case, harm (/benefit) is directly related to the particular species with which we are interacting. If we accept this definition, deciding how we must behave towards any creature is inherently speciesist. If we don't, I fear we'd be considered anthropocentric for imposing our definitions of benefit and harm on creatures which may not share our experiences, desires, or fears.  Ultimately, this is relevant because death may not actually considered a form of harm to non-humans. Humans have an existential fear of death itself, but do other creatures, or are they merely averse to things which would cause them death? And if we were to avoid exposing them to such things before a painless death, are we harming them? Would they be averse to that in the way that most people would protest?

But of course, it isn't. Epistemologies and paradigms change all the time, just like facts do, and methods of ""critical thinking"" can become unquestioned dogmas just as easily as particular beliefs.

So here's a very general history lesson.   Arguably, I would go so far as to say that the West, America especially, has not had any such thing as ""education"", in the original sense, at all since the Industrial Revolution   Well, the Greeks - on the subject of Plato - didn't have an 'education' in the way that you mean, at all. Leaving aside the outliers in Greek education (like the Spartans), the traditional structure of Greek education (our evidence being very Atheno-centric) - as far as we can tell - was threefold, with three major teachers corresponding to their respective parts: the Grammatistes, Paidotribes and Kitharistes. The first, the grammatistes, taught the Greek language and script, and perhaps a little basic math. The paidotribes was sort of the equivalent of the modern gym teacher, but more than that: he was in charge of teaching the young men how to look after their bodies (in a physical sense), as well as teaching them skills like boxing, wrestling, and so on. The kitharistes was sort of the equivalent of the modern music teacher, but again more than that: his job was to teach the children how to sing, recite poetry, and play some instruments. The children received no education at all in the way that we mean it: they were not required to learn things for learning's sake, or taught anything scientific (or otherwise) about the world. This was elite training for a life of symposia and social interaction. To be forgiving, education was designed as a place to teach children how to survive and thrive in their society, and a place to teach them how to understand their bodies and minds, to keep them self-sustaining and independent. There wasn't really a sense of instilling 'values' either, with the obvious exception of the Spartan system which was entirely different and did aim to do this. Women, of course, were not given any formal education at all, nor were the poor.  Anyway, the point is that education has never taught those things. We should stop creating a false image of decline and nostalgia for ourselves. There are valuable things in the Greek system, just as there are valuable things in ours. What we really need, in my view, is an education system that combines aspects of both:   It teaches you about the world. Science, history, geography, languages, and so on. You learn about the majesty of the world you live in because that information is your right, not to teach you to do a particular job. Modern systems gets closest to that out of any other historical education system I've seen, though they're far from perfect. It teaches you how to be a human. We're missing this entirely from our modern education system, and it's the major reason, in my opinion, why we all struggle with different mental illnesses, and so many self-caused physical issues (like obesity). It's nothing to do with modern technology or society, we just never learn to think about ourselves, look after ourselves, and realise, accept, and deal with our flaws, blessings, temptations and so on."

The problem is that most people today simply do not understand what it is, and treat it as a buzzword instead. It's that usage of the term that I'm criticizing.    My point, however, is that what you are (correctly) describing as critical thinking cannot be taught in the way that we teach other factual knowledge. It requires a long process of developing and cultivating a set of skills and internalizing a set of values.   The closest analogue to this kind of process would not be the kind of schooling that we have. It would be the institution of craft apprenticeship and/or the process of acculturation into a religious community.  Graduate degree programs do approximate both of these (the origin of the university was in the Church, after all), but they only develop your abilities in the very small subset of general thinking skills that are related to whatever specialized discipline you choose. We need to extend the process backwards to very young ages, and generalize it to all areas of cultural life."

I never made such a claim.   The claim I did make was that the state naturally protects the interests of those making decisions because the state is an extension of those making decisions on a national level. This is supported by in Socrates' eyes during his apology that the Athenian court was a tyranny of 500 who had basically hoodwinked the entire population into submission allowing the court to execute its will and when someone came along and criticized the sophists and rhetoricians they used exactly the tactic they were being criticized for using to silence the dissent.   Now, how you got out of what I was saying that I seemed to think Nero was a better alternative to the Athenian court, I have no idea. I probably would have been better of you to just ask me what I felt so we could have avoided assumptions and had a meaningful dialogue.   No, I don't think philosopher kings are any better than tyrannical democracies. This is mainly because I think in either case one relies on the assumption that the corrupting tendencies within the human spirit simply disappear with a different structure of thought, education, and government. That doesn't seem like a logical assumption to make. Plato would definitely disagree with me but in his case he didn't have the luxury of a modern human history 3,000 years in depth. And, of course, Plato would most likely counter the claim that corrupting tendencies don't simply disappear by saying that it's through habituation that a person becomes more resilient to those tendencies and those making the decisions wouldn't ever be tempted as they had already achieved the status of virtue and thus we needn't worry.   Plato and I just fundamentally disagree."

Yes, it is necessary to have an efficient and competent management that is dedicated to getting results for the people, and has its popular legitimacy largely based on these pragmatic results. That's what distinguishes success stories like Singapore from backwards despotic regimes like Putin's or Mugabe's, or catastrophic failures like Soviet central planning.

Call is a problem with each member lacking ""perfect knowledge"" about everything and everyone involved in the process. With small groups of people who know each other and ongoing matters to a great degree it can be argued that Aristotle's perspective could be applicable.  However if even one member has greater knowledge etc of topics/situation than the others within the group that ""perfect world"" model would no longer be functional.  If the groups get too large it will take too long to get anything done.. thus democracy in its purest form fails.  If one participant or group there in levies for personal advantage against the others while successfully obfuscating the process we come around to what you described.    In the vast majority of countries practicing democracy in some form there are too many participating players, too many topics, variables and special interest agendas in to fully keep track of... no one single voter or participating member can ever say for any degree of certainty anything about any of the topics being put to the ballot and how they may affect them and society afterwards.

Their idea (of which I'm not a proponent) is basically that if people engage in rational deliberation, they can solve any problem, since even value judgements are rooted in (ir)rational ideas. It's been nuanced since Jurgen Habermas and John Rawls - respectively - repopularized the idea, and if you're curious to learn more, the leading deliberative theorists are probably still Gutmann and Thompson.

The agonist critique espoused by people like Chantal Mouffe and Gert Biesta, and to a lesser extent, Claudia Ruitenberg, is a bit more balanced and leaves much more room for rationality. Their arguments aren't about ""destroying"" rationality, although they do generally maintain that rationality has been used to uphold the hegemony that dominant worldviews have over others.

In this case, the biggest change was having deliberative theorists acknowledge criticisms and end up introduce more socially-just theories of deliberative models. Nancy Fraser, Seyla Benhabib, and Stanley Fish are three examples of prominent deliberative theorists who have worked on that kind of thing. From what I can tell, people are really only beginning to notice radical democratic theorists who work in postmodern veins - such as Jacques Rancière or Chantal Mouffe - so there hasn't been much change to political outcomes from their perspective (yet?).

The main point on my intervention tries to highlight the problem that Kant work on his aesthetics; How can we be sure than something is good, beautiful or bad? What's the criteria? There must be some sort of previous consensus on that. And natural sciences confront the same issue. Think of Popper and Falsificationism; scientifics must work on previous accord in regards to the method they are using, because - as with reason - the procedure defines the product.  And, on that level, there is some sort of democracy. In other terms, no matter how you think about it, as long as human activities are mainly intersubjective, we are bound to decide democratically on how we are going to aproximate especific kinds of experiences. Therefore, in a way, truth as a thing can only be attained through a previous consensus. Does truth hold any meaning  outside of intersubjective experience? That would be a grate discussion.  Now, that ""democratic"" process, wich ocurrs on Habemas' theory can be discussed as wether it is an actual democratic consent (in terms of warrants for actual participation) or not.

They aren't. Profit-making businesses don't accidentally neglect social and environmental costs. They deliberately minimize all costs, and that means they are compelled to externalize costs wherever possible (i.e. wherever they can get away with it). Since decisions at the micro-level aggregate, externalities at the macro-scale of markets can similarly be said to be intentional, not accidental."

Mill's other major idea was his utilitarianism. This is almost begging the question by assuming the falsity of the idea being proven false, though the essay generally considers parts that aren't that affected by this boldness.  In any case, for our democracies to fulfil the truth finding democracies postulated by Mill and Rousseau (kinda), they need to change. Rousseau understood that, because his state looked nothing like familiar ones.   Perhaps philosophers should oppose freedom of expression because the necessary restrictions are not in place. More plausibly, they should push for the necessary radical change. After all, the main issue is that some groups have too much of a voice, and others too little. Academics could well be part of the latter. And being so dependent on outside funding doesn't make being both radical and effective easy. Mill actually avoided that trouble in his own life."

Presumably they assume that US-style parliamentary democracy (with upper and lower parliament houses) is not only the be-all and end-all democracy but also the only kind there ever was or could be while simultaneously berating this democracy style as slanted in favour of the majority when the system is specifically in place to protect the rights of a minority (hence 2 houses with disparity in vote weights).   This level of ignorance from self-described philosophers immediately disqualifies their arguments as completely misinformed. In a participatory democracy the system is, in fact, a ""truth"" machine geared to simultaneously ensure and protect both the individual and the collective from oppression of rights of either, including the right of both to challenge the other's positions. That is the point of it. But to frame the argument inside the confines of parliamentary democracy where all rights are derived from enactment of law including the right to free speech- well duh. Laws can be repealed and amended by parliament. That is the point. This is how the minority of rich and powerful keeps a stranglehold on protecting their rights in spite of the majority.

The reason has, almost entirely, to do with 'image.' But not because politicians are preoccupied with presenting themselves in the best possible light. After all, who isn't? It is a rare and deeply disturbed person who does not wish to project a favorable image. But television gives image a bad name. For on television the politician does not so much offer the audience an image of himself, as offer himself as an image of the audience.

They have good, public higher education, allowing the citizenry to remain informed. They have a wide variety of political parties to allow most views to be expressed. New parties have a comparatively easy road to get into parliament. The media keeps a check on politicians, quickly uncovering corruption or unpopular decisions and ensuring quick consequences for a representative who does not do their duty. The culture allows for and encourages debate among citizens.   The result? A highly popular (based on immigration numbers) region which tends to be among the first to correct social issues, uses tax money efficiently for the good of the nation and not its governance, but suffers some legislative inefficiency at the hands of politicians being afraid to voice unpopular views."

We could of course try to increase the competitiveness of our economy, which would increase the amount of money circling here and also would attract foreign investments. But when people don't want to pay any more taxes nor want the cutting down of public institutions, what are you going to say to get their votes?

The implied reasoning is that some groups level of disagreement causes the groups to act in a somewhat unified tribalistic manner against each other rather than seeking truth or even optimal policy. Perhaps people who mostly agree feel more comfortable with things like trusting each others motives and thus are more likely to take each other at face value, not distort each others arguments, and take each others arguments at the merits. Perhaps people, somewhat naturally and especially when their are identified groups who presume disagreement and presume reasonable honest debate to be impossible.   It's not crazy or racist to suggest this, and I think historically this has been the norm.

The variety of political opinion amongst them runs the gamut from democratic socialists to ethnic ultranationalists. It isn't disagreement that is the problem, it is the lack of trust between the natives and the new immigrants.  It's similar to an internet forum; if you have been a contributor to the forum for a long time, and built up plenty of social capital, then you will have a wider latitude to speak against the consensus opinion and have people still be willing to listen, because people generally trust what you say.

There is very little actual discussion of merits, much circle jerk within the camps and much ad hominem and straw Manning between them.  There's always going to be strong disagreement and people/groups fighting for power by any means at their disposal. If you're saying democracy doesn't work all that well even in homogeneous societies, I tend to agree depending on the metric. But I do think homogeneous cultures probably fair better in terms of having reasoned debates on policy than societies with largish disparate groups with ideas and goals that they see as fully incompatible or antagonistic.   It seems to be an obvious hypothesis that a bunch of groups who identify as groups and share common goals would have a harder time deciding on a policy than a single group would.

It isn't a particularly good way, but the average Joe isn't to blame for that.  With your remark, I assume you are referencing America.  Understand, in America (while there is a representative democracy) the incentives of leadership are wrong.  Blaming bad leaders on the average Joe is a cop out.  The average Joe has almost zero effect on the political process.  Who does have an effect?  Life long politicians, corporate lobbyists, bankers, etc.  (follow the money).    To blame the problems of society on the average Joe, who's only input to the system is 10 minutes for his vote, is stupid - especially when there are thousands of people spending thousands of years (collectively) making all the decisions that affect all of our lives... and their goal is to extract as much money from the rest of us as possible.    Joe isn't wrong for who he votes for, and he isn't lazy.  Rather Joe chooses to live an average Joe's life, and that's fine.  The only thing Joe is wrong about is believing that Democracy is a proper solution to any of these problems, and thinking that the rest of the Joe's out there are somehow to blame."

A stable democracy is a balanced system between leaders, different branches of power (president, government, parliament, law, federal states, free media, unions, NGO's and so on) and of course the population. If it works, all power is in balance and no dictatorship or autocracy can be established. A side effect of this is mediocrity and often annoying compromise. But this is an inherent feature of modern democracies. They work this way. If they wouldn't, power would be very much out of balance. Of course the leaders should rule rationally and civilised.

The reason it doesn't appear so is largely a result of how effective coordinated propaganda can be.  Take an ancient democracy as an example. Now I'm not talking about specific instances, but in general cases the average person was essentially an expert on their own country, and the goings on of key environmental, social, and economic issues.   Take the TPP as an example. Without saying whether I am for it, or against it, it is easy to see how if a large scale trade option were presented to the Greeks how far more of your average Greeks would be able to understand intricate details to determine if it was a favorable or unfavorable deal.  Someone who came out and began peddling obviously false news (e.g., to the level that evolution is not fact) then the average people would have became very hostile towards that party the whole thing would become very apparent.   Today, partially because of our size, partially because of our population, and partially because of digital entertainment and the sheer prevalence of it is much more difficult to determine what the truth is, therefore democracy suffers.

The onslaught of capitalism, for which the ancient Greeks couldn't have predicted, has turned ""truth"" into a commodity to be bought, sold, refined, and resold.  There exists a market for ""truth"" (quotation marks necessary), as opposed to any objective measure of real truth.  People desire to be told they're right, so unscrupulous people will exploit that market to create false ""truth"" that reinforces the desires of the market.  For example, if you want to believe vaccinations harm your children?  Someone will sell you an opinion on why you're right.  When the market for real, objective truth gets diluted by the supply of false, fabricated ""truth"", and the people are unable to tell the difference, the society, as a whole, has abandoned the value of truth.

philosophy,3buwbc,HippeHoppe,1 point,Thu Jul 2 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"Here's a very good book in which the author has done quantitative work on democratic failures. The author (a Berkeley/Princeton educated economist) basically advances the following thesis: that voters have certain cognitive biases which make it easier for bad policies to win out over good ones in the democratic process.  The traditional arguments against this position are:  1) That democracies encourage public debate and that this debate helps us come closer to the truth (this is a more naive argument that political scientists generally don't accept: if it were true, then we'd generally think that the majority of a democracy would, in the end - following a rigorous debate-, favor the 'true' policy).  2) That, even if the vast majority of voters are completely and hopelessly uneducated, they'll predictably divide along even splits (essentially 'flipping a coin' on important policy questions), coming down to a 50-50 split, and the educated minority (correctly believing in the 'true' policy) will prove decisive in picking the winning policy.  The problem with the first one should be obvious, and very few political scientists will entertain it as more than ideological grandstanding. But the problem with the second (which makes a more appealing, more cynical 'structural' appeal as to the effectiveness of democracy) is more interesting: simply put, uneducated voters don't split 50-50 over policy they know nothing about, but instead heavily favor certain policies which appeal to their biases ('wrong policies').  We know that these policies are 'wrong' and that the public is attracted to 'wrong policies' because, while the public overwhelmingly favors them, experts in this field overwhelmingly disapprove of them. While it may be the case that experts have biases of their own and are wrong (""more wrong"" than the public), it's generally safe to assume that this isn't the case, and that, in a disagreement between an expert and a non-expert, the expert is usually right. There is plenty of interesting work on cognitive biases amongst experts, too: this book by P.E. Tetlock is great! But usually this tends to be on issues of disagreement amongst experts: for X controversial issue (over which there's a split in the academic community), experts might be systematically overconfident in their own beliefs, where, in reality, these are very controversial beliefs.  Good examples are global warming+free trade, and oil price+major war predictions. Expert consensus tends to be pretty solid on the first two (global warming is real and anthropogenic; free trade is probably - on net - good), but expert consensus is very divided on the latter two (people are optimists and pessimists when it comes to oil prices and the probability of major wars). However, while experts are justifiably confident in their predictions regarding the first two (because virtually no expert disagrees with them), experts are generally extremely overconfident in the latter two views. Tetlock also found that, after their predictions are found to be wrong (a major war doesn't happen, the price of oil drops rather than rises, etc.), experts almost always try to maintain their original thesis, arguing that their prediction would have come true were it not for some confounding variable they could not have anticipated (and that no experts made the reverse claim: that their prediction was true but only because of some confounding variable, and that it didn't prove their thesis correct).  Still, comparing public and expert views on those issues on which there is an expert consensus is a good argument against democracy generally: on issues of consensus (warming, free trade, etc.), the public overwhelmingly (perhaps less so on warming now than in years past) disagrees with experts. There are numerous cognitive biases at work (in the case of warming, we underestimate the importance of long-term and high-impact consequences because these are seemingly inconceivable, for the same reason Stalin said that ""The death of one man is a tragedy, the deaths of a million is a statistic"" - high-magnitude and timeframe impacts are difficult to comprehend. In the case of free trade, the public has an anti-foreign bias and, as economists say, ""Sees the seen, not the unseen"" - those who ""lost jobs to China"" are more readily identifiable than those who gained employment due to increased economic growth due to free trade). These biases lead the public to go against the academic consensus because the academic consensus seems intuitively ridiculous to them (""warming will flood Florida? Ha! We had snow this year!"").  I think these are good arguments for reworking the franchise - not necessarily restricting it, but figuring out new ways of engineering the electoral system to account for these biases."

Let's be clear when we make this point, because while it's fundamentally right, the straight assertion that's there no major differences between the races doesn't indicate why and looks false on its face. What science seems to have shown is that skin color doesn't track genetic variation well at all. More, close examination of all the candidate claims for ""major differences""--even something like ""being better at sprinting""--seem to involve at best subdomains of a race (i.e., black people from the Caribbean). The resulting thought is that race--as traditionally understood--isn't a worthwhile scientific concept.    So maybe the philosophical question should be ""why race seems to matter?"" but you can not start with the premise that it does (like post-modernists do).   I'd contest your account of what ""post-modernists"" are like, but that term is so vague and covers so many different groups that I'm sure you're right about some of them. Generally, however, I take post-modern theorists to assume that (1) race is a social construct and (2) that social construct matters. If (1) is accepted, it seems hard to argue with (2).

Lets take a historical look and compare the way that white trash is used in comparison to the word nigger.

White people can and do understand these things perfectly well.    I don't think that understanding them is that much in question. It seems like the problem is rather that there are certain forms of discrimination that are not really visible unless you're part of an underprivileged group. So, for example, a woman who has been sexually harassed at her workplace has a different experience than a male co-worker who may be ignorant that workplace harassment still exists. Of course, through talking with him she can try to make him understand (but again, this requires talking)."

philosophy,3bw9gp,Ligerian,1 point,Fri Jul 3 09:22:33 2015 UTC,"well, you're asking the question rhetorically but my response would be that people had their heads shaved before skinheads. There was the concept of north before whiteness, too.   I mean, I think people should feel able to point out things they think are worth noting. It doesn't mean anything necessarily. For instance, if a bald white guy gave a speech, someone might think of skinheads because there's a bald white guy right there. That doesn't mean the guy did anything wrong in the same way that a black guy in a hoodie isn't doing anything wrong just because other black guys in hoodies do shit.   I think ""true north"" is a different kind of case (though I think that's debatable for sure). That's because it has to do with values of truth and goodness: North is associated with the right way. It makes total sense given the history of navigation, but history is a political topic. We can't just see that it makes sense while not seeing that many of those navigators were on slave ships. To some people, the history of white supremacy is vivid in their mind all the time, because they still experience white supremacy today.   I think for a white person (which I am btw) it's hard because what we hear is that everything we do is wrong. The trouble is that in a way, all of our history is immoral. People always say we can't judge by the standards of today, but this is a blatant double-standard, as hitler is the epitome of evil today even though plenty of people were eugenicists, anti-semites, and imperialists at the time.

It is interesting  to study expressions' origin for etymology sake, but, in my opinion, it is a huge waste of time to point out some unconscious racist or sexist biais revealed by the use of some expressions. If someone speaks to you and says ""true north"", you can ask ""do you consider northern countries as more important than the southern ones?"", he says ""no"". End of story!

philosophy,3bw9gp,Ligerian,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:31:04 2015 UTC,"I think the difference here is that you're talking about using language as a way to catch people in their racial bias, when for me the issue isn't directly about individual responsibility.   For example, when you say ""white as snow"" has nothing to do with skin color. People of European descent are referred to as white people, and especially pale Europeans have had their skin described as white for even longer.   It's not about whether an individual associates whiteness with purity and innocence, subconsciously transferring this bias to people with ""white"" skin. It's about the fact that ideas associated with whiteness have been determinant in world history for centuries now, following the industrialization of Europe and the United States.   When I said our history is immoral, what I mean is that there is no neutral starting ground today. For instance, if I'm driving down the road I'm not just driving down the road. The economy has been globalized (again) for centuries, and the road I'm driving on is a product of innumerable historical circumstances. But I also know that the world economy has never been possible without aggression, servitude, and slaughter on a mass scale.   It's always brought up that no white people now owned slaves, or that only a small percentage of southerners owned slaves. First it should be pointed out that chattel slavery still exists on a mass scale and white people undoubtedly own slaves somewhere.   Second, the point isn't that white people owned slaves: it's that white people all benefited from the institution of slavery. In Europe, they think the slavery thing is an American problem; but millions of slaves were transported in order to satisfy European demand for agricultural crops. It's all tied together.   For too long, it has been too simple not too address the crimes of the past. In this time, when our machines are poisoning the environment and driving countless species into extinction, and when our social contradictions are boiling over into generalized civil war (Syria and Ukraine, Euro refugee crisis, police/prison state USA), it is important to be willing to gaze critically at how we got into this mess. Structural white supremacy is undoubtedly a huge part of that.   To show you that I hear what you're saying and appreciate it, there is definitely also the fetishization of white supremacy. It is common in ideology (following Zizek here) to designate one term as the cause of all the problems. An apolitical example is the shark in jaws. So from my perspective, white supremacy feels like it's the people, and the menacing shark is Others coming to destroy my civilization. From the perspective of the anti-racist, the shark would be white supremacy, coming to destroy the world and all non-white people.   The point is that both examples simplify reality. It is false, in my opinion, to imply that everything is the fault of white people. To me, that is because the concept of white people was only created through the same institutions of violence that white people then used to colonize the world: the church, the school, the business, the state. In addition to this, other people in the world are huge parts of world history as well (of course). White people have made decisive cuts into the pages of world history, but for instance Arabs enslaved up to 18 million people from Africa during the middle ages. That's some important shit too.

philosophy,3bw9gp,heavenlytoaster,8,Thu Jul 9 06:13:50 2015 UTC,"The premised observation is not only false, but the opposite seems to be true. The major works on race have as their underpinnings continental and analytical philosophy, as well as influences of postermodernism and relativism, all of which owe a great deal to White men. And why should we be surprised at that? Can you imagine what discussions on ""race"" would be without the Frankfurt school (Jewish Whiteness not withstanding)?   Even if you disregard the philosophical schools that predicate current studies, we find many White male scholars in this century who are greatly involved in studies about race.    Ron Mallon, whose work in the subject is linked here. He is White, he is a philosopher, he talks about race.  There's also Philip Kitcher, who is prominently located in the philosophy of science and biology.  Then there's Neven Sesardic, another White man who is very much involved with where ""race"" relates to philosophy.  Then there's Stephen Cornell, Douglas Hartmann,  Philip Kasinitz,  Lawrence Blum...   The list goes on and on. If you don't believe me, look up ""race"" in the Stanford Dictionary of Philosophy and proceed to google image search the names you come across. At least half of them will be White men.   I think a major problem with social philosophy today is the amount of assumptions made. Like, egregious assumptions. This entire talk relies on the premise that White men do not involve themselves with the philosophical inquiry of race, but this is not only false, but obviously false. Look at this line: I think that what modern philosophers call “pure” reason — the Cartesian ego cogito and Kant’s transcendental consciousness — is a white male Euro-Christian construction. What does that even mean? That ""reason based on a priori principles and providing a unifying ground for the perception of the phenomenal world"" is a construction of White-ness? How can someone possibly prove this, if the proof itself is based on the construct you seek to shed light on?    as if white is not a color   S-sir...   In the gospel Jesus announces his ministry by saying he has come to proclaim good news to the poor and imprisoned and the year of the Jubilee, which meant massive economic redistribution every 50th year!   This is an absolute lie. There was no economic redistribution. Slaves were freed and debts were wiped clean. That's it. There was no economic redistribution. It's akin to how books used to become open to the public after the copyright was gone. This is such a monumental lie, that I want to know what he was thinking when he said this. Did he read about it in some obscure postmodern book and take it at face value? Did he ever try to research the topic before he uttered this? It's just bizarre.    The trigger-happy practices of the police, not all police, but too many police, on the streets of black America should alert everyone to how profoundly adrift American democracy has become — attacking the poor as freeloaders and criminals, a distorted and grotesque ideological exaggeration of freedom over equality. The scandal is that the Christian right has too often been complicit with a politics of greed and hatred of the other.   How he ties this into the Christian right, when so many of the cases of police brutality have occurred in cities run by Democrats, is simply beyond my comprehension.   Just to be clear, there's no shortage of unarmed White people being killed by police. Dillon Taylor is a good example. The White Hispanic man that waved at police and was shot just a couple weeks ago is a better example. This guy is trying to pigeon-hole race into where it doesn't belong."

The Institute made major contributions in two areas relating to the possibility of human subjects to be rational, i.e. individuals who could act rationally to take charge of their own society and their own history.

I recommend books dealing with the culture industry, especially Dialectic of Enlightenment.   No. Tell me where I'm wrong?   Saying that they created a social engineering program is completely off-base. Have you read the post? Here's a relevant passage:   The third problem is, in my opinion, the most devastating. That is that the entire concept of ""Cultural Marxism"" as described above --the ""subverting traditional western values and a means of shifting bringing about socialism or communism""-- is a contradiction in terms. If we take Vladimir Lenin's ""The Three Sources and Three Component Parts of Marxism"" seriously, then one of those parts is Historical Materialism. Historical Materialism itself is based on the ""Base-Superstructure"" model pioneered by Marx. The theory being that there's an Economic Base, in our time it's a Capitalist Mode of Production, on top of which arises a ""Superstructure"" which comprises our politics, culture, art, religion, science, philosophy etc. The base shapes the superstructure, and the superstructure maintains the economic base via ideology. For example, think of a feudal society where the mode of production maintains feudal society by producing goods and services to keep society going and the superstucture, the culture, religion, and politics of a feudal society exist to maintain that base by convincing people that the feudal system is the best thing for everybody.  The fallout of this argument being that you simply can not change Capitalism by getting everyone to be ""Politically Correct"". It simply doesn't make sense in terms of Marxian theory. Here is where I'll make a slide and copy what I've said before on this topic. Who benefits from Political Correctness? Marxists or Capitalists? The answer is Capitalists. The introduction and mass appeal of notions like 'Political Correctness' is not because of some conspiracy by ""Cultural Marxists"" but instead actually appeals to, and is promoted by, Capitalists. Businesses want more customers and in particular, loyal customers. Adopting business policies which appeal to minority groups on the basis of mutual respect is the logical outcome. And by jumping in as a first-adopter of such notions you get a certain loyalty by those who see your company as ""progressive"" for treating minorities with a certain appearance of such respect. In short, you appeal to a broader consumer base rather than restricting yourself to a traditionalist value system that capitalism as a mode of production simply has no time or need for. Don't believe me? Think about the phone sex industry. Doesn't the act of making money providing audio-sexual gratification for someone who you don't care about seem to conflict with traditional christian values? I think it obviously does. And businesses sprung up for that long before ""Political Correctness""."

I don't think it was directly mentioned in the article, but I think I've heard similar arguments other places.

philosophy,3bqsey,TheFakeTomTelesco,40,Wed Jul 1 14:05:58 2015 UTC,"Here's a succinct definition of both epiphenomenalism and Daniel Dennett's position.  From what I remember from reading Dennett in college, it's that epiphenomenalism says that consciousness plays no role at all when it comes to the output of our bodies, and further, on some accounts, that consciousness, under a dual mind, epiphenomenalist position, consciousness becomes, as Dennett puts it, a gremlin in an engine, something we claim that exists but has zero effect and cannot be measured, so it's basically non-existent, for a physical reductionist.  Dennett's push is that you can recognize your consciousness, which then gets you to recognize your consciousness, so consciousness has to have some effect, at least in its existence and your ability to recognize it. If consciousness play no role in physical states, then you wouldn't be able to recognize it, or the recognition wouldn't change what you would do. Imagine like playing a video game that's on rails--you can't change how the character moves at all, including what the character says, and your consciousness just floats along, holding the controller but doing nothing. That's what epiphenomenalism claims, that your consciousness is literally tagging along while your body moves regardless of consciousness' presence.   Dennett came to my college when I was an undergrad and he spoke about the Libet gap and some other things--the Libet gap is that we make decisions before we consciously recognize it. Many have taken that to mean we didn't make the decision at all; this is how Dennett differs because he thinks we still make the decision because our subconsciousness is as much as who we are as our consciousness proper. Dennett's very much against homunculus notions that our brains, their raw physical processes, aren't us. It is precisely that our physical processes are what we are. Consciousness isn't a rider, but sort of the brain's recognition of what we did subconsciously but by our own desire. This is the really tricky notion, and listening to Dennett again after these years, it sounds like consciousness can at least inform us going forward, but I think the informing is happening before we consciously recognize it.  It's like our brain is forming the thing we're going to do, but we're getting a feedback loop with consciousness which checks with what we did do to figure out what we should do next. Consciousness is behind a beat, but its not invisible or doing nothing; it's more the check on the next step.   In short, under Dennett's view, we can recognize our consciousnesses and that recognition causes us to recognize it, make it explicit we know of it, so epiphenomenalism is wrong in practice. Furthermore, consciousness, as a part of the physical processes of our brain, is as much us, who we are, as our subconscious processes. Consciousness occurs as the recognition of what we choose to do after the Libet gap, but the subconsciousness processes before the Libet gap is still us making decisions, just before consciousness picks up that we did it.   Sorry if this is sort of muddled. It's been a long time since I've worked with these concepts, but I refuted epiphenomenalism a lot in college. I still do, even after this research."
philosophy,3bqsey,fandangalo,8,Wed Jul 1 20:26:24 2015 UTC,"Just an addition to what you said, my reading of Dennett also includes a STRONG methodological criticism of the Libet gap, suggesting that the findings are nowhere near as meaningful as they are sometimes interpreted to be."
philosophy,3bqsey,slash196,7,Wed Jul 1 20:55:10 2015 UTC,"It's been awhile since I've read Dennett, but the talk he gave, based on the paper, My Brain Made Me Do It, suggested that the Libet gap is sound in terms of the findings but not in terms of what follows from them.  Many take the gap as, ""The subconsciousness runs the body, and the consciousness does nothing,"" or, better put, ""The subconsciousness, a separate governing body of action, runs the body, and the consciousness, who we really are, does nothing."" This makes it sound like there is a little person inside us who controls what we really do.  Dennett does not accept that, and instead asserts that our subconsciousness is us as much as consciousness is us. There's no distinction, for him, that the subconsciousness is somehow separate from who we are.  Consciousness is the reflecting part of the body that tries to understand the actions we do, or at least, that's how I take Dennett. It might be behind in actions, but we can work through what we did mentally and come up with new solutions to problems we've encountered before.  It still seems like consciousness lags behind, so to speak, in that case, though. If Passive Frame is correct, I don't think epiphenomenalism follows at all, but it might be better put that consciousness is some sort of shadow or mirror that we use for reference and reflect on. Then consciousness is a pragmatic tool rather than a governor."

Epiphenomenalism says that consciousness exists but only as an epiphenomenon - like steam leaving a steam train. The steam that leaves the steam train doesn't cause the train to move but it is present whenever the train is moving as a result of the actual causal process (i.e. the steam engine).  Even though it doesn't deny the existence of consciousness, epiphenomenalism still has big problems since it allows no causal role for conscious mental states begging the question as to why they are there in the first place. For example, if the conscious states of physical pain play no causal role on our behaviour then we can't cite evolution to explain them since, in order to be an adaptation, they must have affected our ancestors physical survival (i.e. they must have had a causal effect on the physical world)"

It is either deterministic or probabilistic - there is no way to assess variables and make a ""free"" choice. You either flip a coin or you run an algorithm whose output can be determined with a given input.  Maybe you can design a complex enough system that it is difficult to determine the output given an input (think encryption) - but given all variables and the actual algorithm, with enough work, you could determine what the action/outcome would be.  Either we flip a coin or our decisions are determined by the physical constraints of our biology. Quantum mechanical action suggests there may be a potential for this, classical mechanics is more deterministic.  Either way, there's very little room for freedom.

It could be simply they weren't smiling with their eyes so the slight falseness alerts you. Maybe their image reminds you of a past fearful event.  An input does not always logically follow in a train of thoughts.   The author writes    According to Morsella's framework, the ""free will"" that people typically attribute to their conscious mind -- the idea that our consciousness, as a “decider,” guides us to a course of action -- does not exist. Instead, consciousness only relays information to control ""voluntary"" action, or goal-oriented movement involving the skeletal muscle system.   I am typing out this response because I derive a bit of pleasure from discussions. Maybe the author enjoys the act of writing. Maybe he is driven to think about things, and in doing so drawn to record his thoughts, and share them.  Even if he ""decides"" to write the article. He not changing the input. Whatever he decides, is what the input was, it was never a choice he could make. Its just consciousness creates a story to explain why it followed that input."
philosophy,3bqsey,tasmanian101,5,Wed Jul 1 18:28:25 2015 UTC,"Well, ok if consciousness isn't the decision maker in the process, then what is consciousness? I've always thought of it as awareness. When I am unaware I cease to be conscious. I'm actually o.k. with not really being in control or calling the shots as long as I'm conscious. I have a very primal fear of losing it.   edit: Obviously, that stems from a fear of dying. But it isn't the dying process that scares me, it is the after where you wouldn't be conscious. A lack of consciousness terrifies me even though I wouldn't be aware."
philosophy,3bqsey,Mithrawn,9,Wed Jul 1 20:00:16 2015 UTC,"Consciousness is observation. Consciousness does not make the calls, rather it is a passive observer. But that is not a comfortable way to exist, we believe we have control over our lives, we believe we think, therefor we are. That primal fear you mention, is what keeps so many people from contemplating the idea.  Consciousness is simply observation. But what we do, unconsciously, is create a story around the actions we observe.  If you have to go to the bathroom. You, as a consciousness, experience the sensation. Maybe you got up and autonomously followed through on the input. Or maybe you decided to not, to wait a minute till commercial break. But if you are thinking of the choice, its already been made. If you were going to go to the bathroom you would have gotten up, but you didnt, instead you created a story to try and makes sense of what happened. ""I choose not to go to the bathroom, I will in a few minutes"" You chose nothing, it was already chosen, but you think after thinking, that at the end of that thought train, is a choice; when actually it starts with a choice.  One thing to keep in mind. Is it doesn't really matter if you are not in control. Because, you never were in control to begin with. Rather, the ego deludes us into believing so. So that fear you are experiencing, the fear of losing power and control, is false. If anything, knowing you are a victim to the whims of your subconscious inputs, allows you to try and guide those inputs into ways you want. It also allows you to release the attachment we have to those thoughts. The stories we create in our head are just stories. Stories that are just trying to understand, explain, and prevent or encourage further sensations."

There are times I step back and have absolutely no idea where the content, context, or style came from, it just feels like it became itself through my actions.

philosophy,3bqsey,Zig_Zagged,3,Wed Jul 1 23:46:46 2015 UTC,"I would consider that creativity. The mind has the beautiful ability to create connections. We learn through randomly trying out things, analyzing its effect, and assigning a judgement to it. You poke a needle, its sharp, that hurts. We start out randomly connecting things as a baby. Learning to crawl is literally trying random things until it starts to work.  When you are in that flow state of creativty. The conscious mind is not interfering. Eg, driving, your brain can zone out and enter a flow state where consciousness lets the unconscious take over and drive.  As you have removed the barrier of creativity. Your mind is free to enter a childlike state again. Where does the content come from? Nowhere, and everywhere. Its a feedback loop, like static on a tv. It is your mind creating new, random, connections, analyzing it and then assigning a judgement. If it feels good, you'll be drawn to do it. Your mind associates things with certain feelings, recreating and recognizing those things, in a painting of randomness, is pretty much the birthplace of abstract. It is not meant to speak to the consciouss mind, but rather it is something the unconsciouss finds beautiful.  You might be interested in split brain experiments. It shows how different our subconscious can be compared to the thoughts we think and vocalize. I believe the content comes from what your subconscious mind finds beautiful, it comes from random attempts and seeing if they feel good or not. We all have a preference of shape, color, and patterns.   And what would you call an awareness of awareness? A lie?   If I am understanding you, yes. Awareness, or consciousness is not aware of its self, it is impossible. For consciousness is the act of observation. You cannot observe and act of observation; if you were, you would be observing an observer, observing the past; not observing consciousness observe the present. The budhist beliefs around this are hard for most people to comprehend. Consciousness does not exist in the past or future, but rather the right now. By observing something you place it into time, you are constantly observing the past. Albiet micro seconds worth, but everything you see, is in the past. If you try and become aware of your awareness, you are not aware, you are lost in the story of thoughts, that resemble awareness. Awareness is losing the need to judge our actions, and is about learning to just experience without placing value. Awareness in part, is letting go of the egotistical need to be in control of our actions, accepting your role as an observer, and accepting that awareness is experience, thoughts are not an experience, but a snapshot of past experiences. Letting go of the need to analyze our experiences, is very difficult, but once you let go and just start experiencing life, interesting things happen, like your paintings. Just keep in mind, if you are thinking, you are not experiencing. If you are thinking about how good something tastes, try and see if you can still taste the experience; I know for me pleasure is in the act, not the thoughts around the act."

The impulse to do what you would normally (things that you already believe in) would be overwhelmed by the impulses from parts of your brain that have been trained to light up when new ideas have been logically validated. These could also add weight to the impulses that influence various actions that until that point, were counter to your worldview. (Note that I'm not a neuroscientist; I am probably way off on the structure and processes of how this all occurs).

This Paper:  Access consciousness is about actually executing planned movements in space.   My silly question:  This paper claims that access consciousness is causally-linked with movement in space.  What do we know about the following ideas?   Non-phenomenological  ""executive control"" (in essence, ""planning"" and voluntary-action)  is causally-linked with movement in time? Metacognition (in essence, knowing about which executive control functions work best, most of the time) is causally-linked with phenomenological consciousness?   What do you think?"

philosophy,3bqsey,blessedbyyeezus,2,Thu Jul 2 02:41:27 2015 UTC,"I've thought about something similar to this before and the way I verbalized it is that the shape of all of the neurons in our brain are like a very very complex calculator. What I mean by that is that if you have two identical brains that receive the exact same piece of stimuli, the neurons will fire in exactly the same fashion. What this means is that our actions are predetermined by the arrangement of our neurons prior to receiving the stimuli. However, since there are (billions, trillions, more?) neurons that are interconnected it would be very difficult to predict human behavior with 100 percent accuracy."

My personal belief is that this theory goes too far, but it's only too far in that the reality is even a bit more complicated than this.   What if emotions have reasoning built into their experience.  The movement of grief to acceptance, possibly could be explained when emotional understanding of the loss has developed internal resources enough to manage independently.  Every step of that process may exist emotionally.  Dysfunction could be explained as the arresting of that emotional process. What if the act of making comparisons and pattern recognition itself exists emotionally? Then it would be a matter of what intellectual cognition adds to the process.   Having a theory that follows along this thread is definitely exciting."

philosophy,3bqsey,borderline_spectrum,2,Thu Jul 2 03:59:07 2015 UTC,Do theories like this ultimately end up saying that things like murder or crime are not in our control? I guess that's the point at which this stops making sense to me. Are they truly saying that we are just observing our actions and lives after they have occurred? Are they truly 100% proposing that we are not making a decision to act in a certain way?
philosophy,3bqsey,PENIS_VAGINA,7,Wed Jul 1 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"I think it needs to be taken from a slightly different perspective. It isn't that murder isn't in our control, it's that there isn't an actor doing the controlling at all. From a moral standpoint this could be a bit tricky, since without an actor you really can't pronounce a moral judgement on actions (i.e. a falling rock that crushes a person can't be said to be evil; it's just a rock).  From a practical standpoint however, even if there isn't an ""actor"" that can be said to be responsible for deciding to murder someone, we can still protect the rest of ""us"" by locking that person up, just as we would install barriers to keep the aforementioned rock from falling."
philosophy,3bqsey,smithmwk,3,Wed Jul 1 17:22:50 2015 UTC,"I think yes, theories denying free will (or 'conscious' free will) do say that no-one is ultimately morally responsible for their actions. But, I don't think this necessarily leaves us in moral bankruptcy - and even if it did, this wouldn't make it any less true. For example, if we believe a murderer isn't ultimately responsible for his actions, that doesn't mean we have to let her go free. Rather, the reasons for imprisoning her still exist, as do the deterrent reasons for punishment. What it does affect is a more compassionate approach to criminals - making punishment for its own sake unjustifiable, as everyone is just a victim of circumstance.  The theories don't say we observe our actions after they occurred, more like as they occur. And 'we' are still making the decisions in a sense - our brains/bodies are making them, based on our past experiences and genetic make-up, etc. But we don't get to make them consciously."

Everything is under our control, if 'we' are the whole - consciousness, subconsciousness, somatic nervous system, glands, everything. Because everything influences 'us'.   Point of this theory is just that consciousness gives itself way too much credit in steering the ship.  Of course, if you stick to the intuitive notion of 'I'=consciousness, then 'I' really might not be responsible for actions it attributes to itself. It doesn't matter though, the whole is still a being that will be held responsible."

However, having just read through the paper quickly  I feel I can attempt a ""dipshit"" explanation. lol.  Before touching on their ""Passive Frame Theory"" I will introduce you to the Somatic Nervous System. The Somatic Nervous System (SoNS) basically refers to all the nerves running from your brain to your muscles. It comprises a portion, not the entirety, of your brain stem, spinal cord and array and nerves extending to every inch of skin and piece of muscle in your body. Essentially, this is the system of nerves which controls your voluntary muscles movement (not the nerves in charge of your heart for example).  This system of nerves (the SoNS) takes input from your brain, from your other senses, and sometimes from itself (see reflexes), and directly makes your muscles contract. Furthermore, through coordinated effort of these muscles contractions, the SoNS makes your body move and do complicated things such as eat, masturbate, or run for example.  So at this point it should be clear that whatever controls signals to your SoNS is what controls your life. The ""Passive Frame Theory"" (PFT) suggests a new way of thinking about how different parts of your brain compete for control of the SoNS. As far as I understand it, PFT is pragmatic in its approach, dealing only with low-level conscious experiences (tooth aches, itches, smells, visual afterimages, etc...). It offers a systematic way of looking at simple cases of SoNS takeover. It is a rigorous framework for examining how simple sensory inputs merge into and modifies other related signals attempting make the body do something.  More deeply, it assumes no ""free will"" in this process. Explaining that ""it is the result of thinking, not the process of thinking, that appears spontaneously in consciousness"" It would seem as though we are simply ""conscious"" of things which are most at the cusp of being able to dictate to your SoNS.  That last line is more of my interpretation of the concluding statements in the paper and not so much a direct quotation so please take it with a grain of salt. I hope this has been a decent dipshit explanation."
philosophy,3bqsey,nk1tz,12,Wed Jul 1 14:33:19 2015 UTC,"Consciousness's primary purpose is to move bones and muscles around.  It also translates communication with others.  It's like the software that runs your computer.  You don't spin up the hard drive or manage IO operation to RAM, it does, but it doesn't actually know why it's doing it.  It means, we are animals, but we have this special over active interpreter inside us trying to connect meaning to everything.  We are simply reacting to stimuli like a plant, and consciousness is just watching, relaying messages between deeper more basic parts of the brain and the body (but meanwhile it's observing whats going on).

When you are asleep your brain is not. A variety of functions can / do occur while you are sleeping. These functions may or may not involve recording daytime memories into long term memories, recording ""muscle memory"", running simulations of future actions based on stored data, etc. (similar to the aha moment after doing something else). The conscious mind is a television show for dissemination of data, it is not the seat of free will or decision making. This is a very important point that many people frequently do not understand. The conscious mind is a communications tool, it is not the seat of decision making or personality. Your brain is the ultimate parallel processing computer.

Nonetheless, that thought was there for a second.  I also think about it when not cleaning my house. I know that I would be happier with a clean house, but I watch TV instead. Eventually there is a build up of impulses that reach some undefinable tipping point in my head where the house is too dirty and suddenly it becomes a priority over TV.

IMO there simply is no evolutionary reason at all for consciousness to exist, it does not cause anything at all to happen, it has no function, everything that it 'does' can be explained perfectly well by referring to inanimate entities. I don't think it has any agency whatsoever.  The most appealing explanations to me are either that qualia is a byproduct of complex computing or, as Chalmers (and others) have suggested, a fundamental part of the universe. However I am skeptical of aspects of both of those explanations and still neither are very satisfying for reasons I won't go into here."

I'm of the opinion that the self and qualia are intrinsically linked. If there is a ""self"" present in a brain, then that self must have a mechanism for actively perceiving and acting on information, i.e. some mechanism for self-awareness and self-control. Qualia is that mechanism. It is entirely meaningless to speak of qualia absent a self, they are two sides of the same coin. And so any analysis of qualia that doesn't simultaneously include the self will necessarily come up empty."
philosophy,3bqsey,hackinthebochs,4,Thu Jul 2 02:46:58 2015 UTC,I believe you are wrong; qualia does not require a self; qualia is what some eastern philosophies would call a watching; a watching without a watcher; what you call the self is nothing but another object for that watching.

I think it is possible to understand that, but it would take a lot of research and probably advanced mathematics.

It wasn't until the late 80's to early 1990's that imaging techniques were advanced enough to study real-time brain processes.    I'm not aware of any study that has even come close to conclusively proving that consciousness is an illusion. There is barely even a framework to DEFINE consciousness. On top of all that, you need to differentiate between autonomic process and cerebral process since these are vastly different system of a high complex and interconnected brain. Studying one and trying to make conclusions about the other is bad science, to say the least.    The problem I see with the OP is that it is confusing attention/focus and what is commonly referred to as consciousness. What we perceive as consciousness could be an emergent phenomenon of higher level neural processing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Create_a_Mind). Neural processing in the cerebral cortex isn't only sensory. It has the ability to feedback internal ""thought"" stimulus into the thought hierarchy.    Either way, we only barely understand what is going on, and the models for prediction have only just recently been purposed. To claim that the science is in on this is kind just wrong."

It doesn't do a lot of the tasks people take it to be doing, like making decisions or retrieving memory.  This isn't to say that consciousness is uninvolved in these things though.  If I make a carefully thought out decision as to what job I should take, my consciousness didn't make the decision but it did direct the parts of my brain that do so to work on the problem for x number of hours and connected it with various memories (that were identified by other brain processes).  It's not passive.  Consciousness collects information, creates representations and modifies other brain processes based on that.  I might remember something and realize that it conflicts with another memory and then modify one or both of them - that's triggered by consciousness.  I might see a giraffe but then consciously realize there are no giraffes here and look closer - realizing it's just an oddly shaped tree."

I think that from that perspective, it isn't actually possible to ""make a carefully thought out decision"". The brain is acting on impulses from external stimuli and inputs from other areas of itself and acting accordingly. What we deem ""consciousness"" is the brain's ability to recursively analyze it's own processes, create justifications, and see causality in them.  Even in your example of deciding to think on a problem for a certain number of hours and connect that process with memories could be automatic processes. The ""conscious"" brain could be more an observer than participant and rationalizes ""choosing"" memories after the fact.  (As an aside; it's so hard to discuss this using English or any language.

You then stop and think ""Do I really want to do that?""  This seems to me like your consciousness directing the decision making portion of the brain to re-evaluate.  Similarly, you might have a thought and then question ""Why do I believe that?"" and then you investigate your justifications which may or may not be good and, once elucidated effect your decision processes.  This also seems like an action of consciousness.  It's kind of like an integrator/error-checker."

(drops mic)   Wright is dead in the water. His interest is genuine, though. What he wants to explain is why we feel as if we are in control of ourselves. Why and how does the functioning of the human brain give rise to an experience?  This question is still up for debate. Some people - dualists, Wright - will probably never consider it answered because they A) consider ""consciousness"" to be metaphysical in nature or B) want to find a specific module in the brain to point to and call the ""consciousness thing."" Other people - materialists, Dennett - will simply consider it answered when the workings of the human brain are decrypted/understood.  I watched this video whilst thinking about all this.

philosophy,3bro31,He-Hell,6,Wed Jul 1 16:29:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see what's the problem here. ""Rights"" is a historically constructed concept, so what? It is the same for every single concept, and not only in philosophy.  As for whether fundamental rights are some sort of ""natural law"", I think the author is just misunderstanding the claim: when we say that something is a natural right, we mean that it is fundamentally justified in reason and that therefore it would still be morally wrong to deny it even if it was not recognized by the State. But of course this moral justification is debatable, and many people might object and claim that X is not a fundamental right. It is not easier to decide what is or isn't a fundamental right than it is to decide what is right and what is wrong in general. In this regard, the various declarations of human rights are not supposed to be some sacred texts telling us the truth about rights; they are positive law, debated and adopted by the people, on the basis of what they believe to be fair."

Overall I’d say that’s about where I stand, though I actually think the idea of rights goes back a little bit earlier than that (we’ll see over the next couple weeks). The thing about useful fictions is that you have to recognize when they are useful fictions; it gets dangerous to take them for reality.   It's extremely important that as generations of humanity progress, we understand why these rights are in place to begin with, lest society throw out the whole concept at the first realization that they're often taken for granted without further explanation."

No fiction needs to be involved.   That's a very valid point.  I'll have to think more on it, because you've got me wondering whether it's better to instill the fiction first and then provide the explanation later, or start with educating on the explanation and hoping enough people understand it to keep rights in place.  I think it ultimately comes down to our faith in the general population's willingness to go out and seek answers and draw conclusions on their own, or to trust in philosophical and legal thinkers to do the heavy-lifting for them.    Now that I write it out, I'm inclined to agree that education is preferable to useful fiction.  My only other thought is that useful fiction is some small degree better than nothing at all."

You have liberals, who defend it as some sort of social construction as a result of constitutionalism and subjectivism.  And you have these guys who argue that rights are intersubjective normative elements that exists within communication which are product of socio-historical necessities of societies that have gained consensus validity within the normative reality.

philosophy,3bro31,Pun_In_Ten_Did,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:48:29 2015 UTC,"Where to begin?  The idea of 'rights' has a historical context which is completely missed in this essay. The rise of rights comes at the same time as the rise of naturalistic philosophies and the realm of rights comes from trying to construct naturalistic morality.   Rights are typically supposed to be something different from utility; they are not the sort of thing one can trade off and weigh.   This might be a common lay understanding of rights, but it need not constrain a philosopher's thinking on the subject. The term 'right' is simply a term to describe moral imperatives in a context free of religious dogma, even if they may align with and have been discovered through the examination of religious dogma.  Once the idea of natural rights took hold, then it was time for the politicians to have a shot at operationalizing these ideas. This created a distinct category of legal rights, which describes a set of governing principles which should be held above other, lesser concerns. These often, but not always, attempt to describe in legal terms a commonly held moral or natural right.  The philosophical question regarding rights is whether one can describe a naturalistic morality. While this is certainly an area rife with disagreement, few would find someone unreasonable for believing such a thing is worth at least exploring. As an example, nearly everyone would agree that society shouldn't permit human murders without exceptionally good reasons, although exactly what those reasons should be is an area of likely debate.  This brings us to the criticisms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is a political document designed to operationalize philosophical ideas. It is no fault of this document that it seeks to not dwell on the reasons for its content. The framers of this document have reason to believe that most societies around the world can agree to a basic set of morals, constructed such a set, and asked states to affirm or reject it. Pragmatically, one's individual reasons for agreeing to this basic set of morals are irrelevant and many would say that the commonalities of morality in so many disparate cultures is evidence in support of natural moral rights. The UDHR's primary purpose is political, not philosophical, and the criticisms of it in this essay are unfounded.  The argument here is a straw man which sets an unattainable goal for rights and then proceeds to dismiss them without considering the term as a pragmatic tool giving us words to describe more specific, philosophically legitimate problems."

Two different people with different approaches can add 2 and 4, and whether or not those numbers are ""true"" or ""real"", they reach the same answer.

This effect is prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behavior, and is driven by the assumption that surrounding people possess more knowledge about the situation.   Basically, sometimes people just want to feel that they are OK. My perspective as an expat is that there is a huge social stigma with being ""wrong"" (not fitting in) in American society--wrong can be anything: having an impopular opinion, expressing oneself strangely, not saying what people expect, not behaving like people expect, etc. I find, that's where dogma sets in. It is often used as a tool to defend oneself, ""make ourselves right"".  The ability to make people feel like they are included, part of a group, even if their opinions are ""odd"" or incorrect, is a really good skill to learn. Even when people are blatantly wrong, sometimes just making them feel like they're heard or that people understand their POV (even if scientifically incorrect, for example) goes a long way to continuing a discussion and eventually coming to a consensus in the longer term.

You are missing the point that learning isn't just reading books and listening to a professor. Conversation is a process of learning too and of course someone who is interested in a problem will read books and listening to a professor. Learning isn't a prerequisite for life.

Your unmarked quotation/reference may be a casual jest, but it actually signals a difficulty for your side; only those who deny a role for hierarchy need to engage in Orwellian stretching. I am quite comfortable claiming that some claims are better than others, and with community norms putting some some claims at a disadvantage.   As for ""who decides"" -- communities decide. No one independently wields power in a conversation. I can only proceed from premises which are agreeable to my interlocutors. If my premise is not secure, then I will have to secure it by working from less controversial resources.   As for the dialectical nature of learning, sure that's great. Our conversations, however, are always embedded in a preexisting matrix of authority. ""Different points of view make sense, but only if there is a common coordinate system on which to plot them."" (Davidson, ""On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme""). This coordinate system is inevitably normative. Even making sense of another person's discourse, not just evaluating it or preferring it, depends on the presence of a code of authority, a ""dogma"" of common topics, a body of accepted facts/truths. There is no pure conversation and we wouldn't want it if we could have it.   Philosophy, therefore, should be about conversation and dogma, prosecution and defense, the coordination of purportedly new and improved ideas in a preexisting framework of knowledge.   Professors, for the most part, have earned their stripes, so students should do most of the listening. There should be conversation, but much of the professor's side of the conversation is diagnostic assessment (they've heard these questions before) geared toward figuring out where conceptual gaps are and helping the student along. If we were speaking of pure equals here, if professors had no cognitive authority, it would make no sense to prefer talking to them rather than anyone else. To the extent that they are authorities (and we should hope they are!), however, they represent a position of cultural authority (a dogma) which stands above the present learning of the student. It is a hill for them to climb with the assistance of the professor.   As for language, it only needs to be precise enough to get the job done. In philosophy, however, precise use of language matters. There are massive intellectual sink-holes we can get trapped in if we use poorly defined terms, if we unwittingly equivocate on a key point. I heartily agree that we should not make a fetish of vocabulary and that we should not exclude people from conversation for not using the right terms. That stated, however, we should be sure to use terms which aid understanding and we should be open to learning how to use terms in a more precise fashion when it benefits a discussion."

philosophy,3bqzhs,MelonMelon28,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:00:39 2015 UTC,"There are many different interpretations in this thread. At least in accordance with the tradition, nature comes from natura and refers to that which emerges as it ought to. Nature is nurtured (same root), to become what it is. What it is might be dangerous, violent, chaotic, or more or less ""stable"" to us. Techno-logy comes from the Greek ""techne"" , ""logia"". Techne means craft or skill, but more properly means an activity defined by a common aim. So the techne of carpentry is defined by building beautiful or useful wooden furniture. Logia means logos but also language, and in this case, the discourse or knowledge of.  Technology is that which is predetermined, certain, and made so. Technology breaks down, it has to be kept in repair, but for the most part technology does what it is supposed to do, ie what it was designed to do. Unlike nature, who's end we cannot clearly determine, we can determine the ""end"" (point of, meaning of) technology since we're the ones who make it.   So the quote now stands in new light. We trust in nature. We trust that nature will find a way, that nature will do its thing, that nature is trustable because nature is whatever it is that eventually turns out as it should. Our fate on this planet is often treacherous, however, or seems forsaken. Thus, we aim to alter our destiny by using technology. Therein lies hope because we know what it is that technology can do (or does) and so we can hope in it. I don't hope that my laptop will turn on, but I can hope that technology develops to transform my desire of a laptop which never loses charge, to reality. I can't hope that nature just fucking figures out how to engineer a proper laptop battery. Maybe in a billion years, but in the meanwhile, Apple will probably get there first."

They still use the same windmills in Holland that created the country in the first place. Now, with few magnets and wires, you could be generating electricity when the wind blows.   I am currently exploring and designing many ideas to do just that, a better mousetrap using today's and yesterday's technology. The great thing about old tech is it can be less precise, more forgiving and made out of the detritus of other machines.  We get trapped into incremental improvements of existing designs. It's easy, it's profitable, it works. But it might not be the best way to do things. Like all ski lifts are just bigger version of a rope around two pulleys.  An example: I thought of a ski lift. I thought of one where the wire didn't move. Where there were improvements in every area and energy scavenging as things came downhill. Real thought with copious notes, sketches, basic calcs, numerous changes based on discussion, etc.   Instead of being more advanced, it takes the improvements we have learned to make our hi tech things and applies it to improving low tech things. Reduced manufacturing, materials, use of waste materials, designing for long life and as free of disposable parts as possible, etc.  We have reached our species point of diminishing returns, if we continue in this fashion. We should back off, harvest the materials of the infrastructure, and move towards where we can better sustain ourselves and each other.

The cocooning angelic spheres that sheltered earth and provided safety to man have also been obliterated with the Truths of the scientist; man has travelled into celestial space and looked back on earth enframed within the heavens. Where was God and where do we go now when we die?   So, all these fantasies about a utopian future furnished by technology are hardly surprising to me. Of course technological truths are dressed up secularised monotheist dogma. Both operate in the same dualist fashion detached from the world making them a direct revolt against nature. That's how you get this claptrap, below, and the scientist has the exact same outlook with his dualist reductionism -   God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.

philosophy,3bmcjz,LouisBonaparte,2,Wed Jul 1 02:58:30 2015 UTC,"Making abortion illegal does not eliminate the question entirely. Because, as you hint at, that wouldn't address the problem of women still getting pregnant and not being able to take care of the child, and the moral costs that come along with that. If everyone ate only plants then the question would be eliminated entirely. And it would address the problem.   Fair point.  It would remove the potential moral problems surrounding unwanted children.  However, let me counter by saying that making meat-consumption illegal brings in new problems not previously present: that is, can we in good conscience outlaw personal preferences for actions that are not guaranteed to be immoral?  At this point it becomes a question of the lesser of two evils (not unlike abortion): restricting privileges, or allowing for an action that is morally muddy?    A more accurate equivalent to what you're saying is not making abortion illegal, but if everyone abstained from sex. That would address and eliminate all moral questions.   Except for the moral question of restricting freedoms that need not be restricted.   I simply don't think your comparison stands up to any much scrutiny.   It wasn't supposed to be a perfect analogy.  It was to demonstrate that going overboard and demanding everyone demand we adhere to one subset's moral convictions before giving fair assessment to the moral claims and seeking compromise is unreasonable."

I'm not certain that it is.  I mean, for the person who has little to no desire eating meat, then yeah no problem there.  But, and let's just make this a thought experiment (I love those), let's consider the person who has a deep familial and personal connection with BBQ.  This person grew up with family and friends around ""the Q"" and has longstanding generational family recipes.  He has a business of grilling tender steaks and raising cattle that supports his family and brings nostalgia and a joy neither of us can ever fully fathom.  Does this person bear the same moral ease of giving up his very life's passion to quell the moral haziness of meat consumption?  I would posit this is not so.  If he is not a utilitarian, and does not hold that animals hold unalienable rights, then the moral act of foregoing his life's purpose is arguably far more detrimental than becoming a vegetarian to assuage any moral conflicts brought up about meat consumption.   Now, obviously we fall somewhere in between Mr. BBQ McMeaterson and Singer the Utilitarian.  Maybe it's the case that it's morally easier for some than others.  Hell, to my wife (she's a vegan—and no, we really do respect each other's opinions and lifestyles), it's as clear as day.  To me, not so much—but I have a longstanding appreciation of meat that brings other goods into my life.  These cannot be ignored when considering the moral question.  I don't know if you or anyone else has an argument to address the cost of foregoing freedoms and pleasures for the sake of moral satisfaction, but I think that's still an excellent subject to further hash out."

That's a very fair point.  I think it indicates that people who subscribe primarily to virtue ethics would have to be convinced it's a sound argument that deserved refutation.  However, the question of means to the ends for things not containing unalienable rights becomes very hazy.  For instance, riding horses these days serves no other purpose than our pleasure.  It's arguable that horses much prefer running wild and free, however.  Are the ends (riding) justifiable for the means (raised horses)?  I would say the answer is not so obvious or even certain.   With animal consumption, yes there is suffering—I won't pretend there isn't and I won't try to argue that it's less suffering than letting them live freely (I'm not a utilitarian)—there is also, however, the question of to what degree this suffering should be considered with respect to our natural desire to consume them.  By no means is there a hard line in the sand (most of us have no problem killing a big spider in our closet, or keeping birds as pets with clipped wings), so it's up to us to reason soundly on what that tradeoff should be.   In fairness, I'm largely opposed to factory farming practices.  I'd much prefer a steak I knew roamed freely and consumed grass and got sunshine.  That's why I pay through the nose for meats that have the best accreditations possible in hopes that they only get better with future investment.

This spectrum of comparison only matters if you subscribe to a Utilitarian model.  And in the same way you argued that smoking is different from eating meat, so is beating up a dog: it's a conscious act directly interacting with the animal, conceivably for no other purpose than to bring the dog pain—that's sadism, in direct violation of any virtue ethics model or reasonable assumptions about suffering.   In either case, it doesn't address the problem, because it's far more arguable that beating dogs is not morally permissible where consuming meat is.  That's the problem presented to you.  If you cannot demonstrate that animal consumption is quite reasonably immoral, then it can't reasonably be outlawed, no matter how it fits into your utilitarian model.

All it is an argument for is whether or not we should use antibiotics.   Chicken farming isn't vital but it's a big piece of the vital agricultural industry.

Chicken is one of the more efficient means of converting protein from grain into protein from meat, but you still lose more than 2lbs of grain to produce a single pound gain of live weight poultry, which means the conversion of protein is even less efficient, as a live chicken over-represents the amount of edible weight.  This shouldn't be at all surprising, it is basic thermodynamics that every time you are converting the calories from one source to another you are going to do so with some inefficiency, thus wasting more calories than by simply consuming the calories directly from plants.    In theory eliminating factory farming and isolating all meat production to areas that cannot be farmed would produce more net calories for human consumption than simply eliminating all meat production altogether, if the world ever got that desperate for food and still had excess energy to spend on the extra refrigeration and production meat requires.  However, given that 75% of the current agricultural product of the world is wasted on this incredibly inefficient conversion of plants to meat products, simply eliminating this one factor altogether would more than feed the growing population of +7 billion."

They're talking about the recreational killing of endangered species in the wild, but they keeping bringing that shit up for some reason. Do ""endangered"" species deserve rights, and that one chick is all like ""ALL animals are cute,"" then everyone claps and shit. Right, animals are a sacred part of our planets eco-system. Lets not forget, we were once apart of their consciousness level to. So yes, we are indeed on a higher consciousness level then the ""sentient beings that are native to the wild"". Why? We don't fully understand. We were given an incredible power higher intelligence, and that's why we've mastered basic survival. We hunt and gather on an industrial scale and produce more food than the natural planet could even handle. So why hunt? idk ask a hunter. Ask the billionaires in the ivory trade. Ask the starving people in third world countries. We've been hunting animals for basically our entire time on this planet and before that. Now that there's a grocery store, animals are suddenly ""inherent beings""? Animals kill animals. That's how it's worked for some time now and that's how it will work until the planet dies out. Animals play an interesting role to humans because we seem to be the only species who's killing and ""wearing"" them as well. We understand the usefulness of animals other than sustenance and we tend to abuse that usefulness. We could try giving animals rights, but that just delays the inevitable. The only way to fix this is to completely change the way modern society is set up. How we get our food, our resources. It's near impossible.

I agree that the way you've presented IV makes it seem rather dumb. But my reading of the Wikipedia article doesn't match up with your explanation of IV. The intrinsic property must be mind dependent, especially since the article uses the example of Kant's end-in-itself since Kant grounds this notion in reason.   However, I don't understand how this applies to animal ethics. If we take a utilitarian approach (as opposed to say, Korsgaard) to animal ethics it seems that if they can undergo pleasures and pains then they must be the subject of our moral concerns.

I am in favor of animals being treated kindly, and not hurt or injured, because of the effects of such things on, again, mind and consciousness.  Harming animals, I would argue, harms the mind and consciousness of both harmer and harmee (is that a word?).  Value, ethics, philosophy, all must begin with mind and consciousness.  But Intrinsic Value says ""That bug, that tree, that grass is valuable on its own, not because I like it, not because any other thing likes it, but just because it IS.""  It makes no sense.  Nothing has value without a valuer.  Intrinsic Value doesn't stop at dolphins or orcas, or bugs, or trees, or bacteria.  It doesn't stop anywhere.  It keeps on going and going.

Pick any occupation, and there's going to be some level of danger for humans and therefore some amount of work-related deaths, injuries, suffering. This isn't a counterargument to humans having an inherent moral value.  Pretty much anything you do has a non-zero chance of harming or killing a human (or animal) but there's a really big difference between me carefully driving my car to the store and me deliberately running people over Carmageddon style because I think it's fun — even though both activities are known to involve some chance of human death.   people ought to remember that advising people to just lay down and starve to death is not a sensible philosphical position.    Since I didn't watch the video, I can't be absolutely certain that the author isn't unreasonable but essentially no reasonable person is making that sort of claim.

Like a ""In a perfect world scenario,"" ""pipe dream,"" or something like that. But she also shows a little bit of restraint, and understands the limitations of what she's arguing.   At the beginning they talk about a ""line"" that needs to be drawn. She appears to agree that sentience, or morality, or even just the value of an organism as equal to human beings maybe isn't so concrete. For example, the house fly or even the micro-organisms that the guy mentions would seem a little ridiculous and lead to the scenario you're talking about. She even admits that not all endangered species are sentient beings. She just thinks it's important to extend our compassion to species. It may be hard to agree with the 'equal to humans' part, but I still think it's a fair point.   Maybe I'm a hypocrite because I eat meat, but her point, while maybe not ideal for putting into practice, is important to address because of the real entrenched cultural norms of how we view animals. Maybe we do need a 180. I'm sure you've heard about that mass extinction by humans, and even things like producing meat and how it really isn't great for the environment (i think might need to source that). But also on the other hand, population control in order to save a species, like that rhino that the american bought the hunting rights for complicates everything as well. Do we just let endangered animals be, what else can be done? If they're really equal to humans than why can't they figure it out themselves?  She seems a little cynical, maybe even a self-hating human, but there's more reason behind the broad quote I put in the title, and I'm pretty sure she still wants to maintain a decent sustainable human society. A ""line"" may be important to establish.   I think a decent, maybe slightly unrelated example, as in not related to undangered species, or even just a completely bogus remark because I don't know a lot about animals: Why do we eat pigs, but it is incredibly taboo to eat a dog. The same for horses and cows. Why? because they're pretty?  I included that quote in the title because I thought it might ""generally"" summarize both sides of the debate. Also it's quite bold, so I guess it's a shameless clickbait. Also I have no background knowledge of this topic, and kinda diverted from the ""endangered species"" focus. I'm not normally interested in philosophy, but something about this grabbed me, so sorry for the rant.   tl;dr: she seems a lot more flexible than just, ""we are no better than any other living thing on earth and humans should really just go back to before the stone age and roam with the elephants, or die off, because we don't deserve any of what we have."""

philosophy,3bmcjz,Galligan4life,2,Wed Jul 1 03:33:37 2015 UTC,"Let's also take this into consideration: the strong majority of cattle and animals grown for meat consumption are fed agricultural crops such as corn, hay, grains, etc.  In fact, a large majority of cash crops are grown to feed cattle, not humans.    So, if you eat animals, you're creating an even higher demand for agricultural resources and therefore statistically likely to kill off even more insects, mice, and worms in the process.    So if we take a purely act utilitarian standpoint on this, eating meat is still morally worse than a vegetarian diet regardless if it still kills these animals."

Our physical well-being benefits from the prevention of extinctions of species critical to our environment. This is pretty objective most of the time. Nobody wants to cause the extinction of our food crops, for example.  Our emotional well-being benefits by meeting whatever arbitrary moral standards we've come to accept through a combination of our own empathy and the logical arguments we've learned from other people. These logical arguments are generally rationalizations to support whatever these people intuitively felt due to their own empathy. Thus we develop a communal moral standard that must be met for optimal emotional well-being.    Ultimately, we run into the same problem we face with abortion, drawing arbitrary lines where we feel moral standards are met. All arguments surrounding these arbitrary lines are simply rationalizations for the intuitive empathy that we all feel, colored by attempts to achieve internal logical consistency with our other beliefs.   There is no ""correct"" moral standard, except the one that makes us feel the best."
philosophy,3bmcjz,Galligan4life,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:46:46 2015 UTC,"Why is this argument still circulating as some type of philisophically credible response to the argument of vegetarianism and veganism?  It holds no level of critical thought or engagment with what proponents of animal rights are saying.    The fact that this is the top rated comment shows people's ambivalence to approach this issue seriously or critically beyond the shallow questions a 5 year old may ask when encountering a complex issue.    As Vulpyne already brilliantly pointed out, the fact that animals suffer in the creation of produce doesn't mean that the cause of trying to REDUCE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE the suffering of animals is lost.  To eliminate all suffering in the world is next impossible short of killing everything so that nothing is left to suffer.  Not many utilitarians are in favor of that because the issue is far more complex than just physical suffering (the loss of life is considered a large negative even sometimes if that life has to confront a lot of suffering).    This and the argument that killing plants is morally equivalent to killing animals needs to be called out for the pathetic attempt of a response that they are because they need to ignore very obvious and integral arguments of the animal rights position.    Plants don't clearly suffer in the way that animals do and they don't have the proper anatomy to experience pain, which is a major metric of something's ability to suffer (nerves/a nervous system).    Edit: Ah, I remember now.  Animal rights ethics still isn't accepted in this subreddit in general.  So any argument, even tenuous and shallow will be upvoted while deep and engaging responses that have an animal rights slant get downvoted.   I think I'd rather sacrifice my karma to be philosophically astute on the issue than win the admiration of meat eaters who like to hear any argument against vegetarianism they can so they can go back to eating their hotdog in peace and not actually engage the issue thoughtfully.   It'd be one thing if the top comment against animal ethics was thoughtful and considered the actual points debated, but this dribble?  I thought /r/philosophy was better than that."
philosophy,3bmcjz,xntrek,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:44:57 2015 UTC,"Plants don't clearly suffer in the way that animals do and they don't have the proper anatomy to experience pain, which is a major metric of something's ability to suffer (nerves/a nervous system).   I have always had an issue with this logic. There is an arbitrary line drawn that is being defined by a form of speciesism that favours the argument of a particular side of the argument. Mirror tests defined a line until it was realised that any animal unable to see was fair game. The simple existence of a brain was then trumped as the line, until it was realised there were many animals who did not have brains, so then the existence of the nervous system became the new line.   However, it's a continuously moving arbitrary line trying to define an ethical or moral stake in the fabric of reality that blesses the continuation of action A whilst condemning action B.    Why is this argument still circulating as some type of philisophically credible response to the argument   As you are probably aware, in considering (especially Western) attitudes toward plants, there is an hierarchical ordering based upon the construction of exclusionary, “oppositional value dualisms” which is predominant.   I find that a lack of knowledge of plants – due to a general similarity of plant surfaces and textures, the fact that they seemingly lack autonomous movement, and possibly due to the fact that plants do not prey on humans at all – are possible reasons for the phenomenon of plant blindness that is rife in the human experience and thus espoused through the construct of the aforementioned logic, which I am going to call out as a zoological centric speciesism.  Plants, I'm afraid to tell you, do clearly suffer. The fact that you do not recognise that suffering is a failure of the understanding you have, not of the plant's lack of nervous system. As an example, grass emits a form of chemical scream - a Volatile Organic Compound if you like - when it is eaten. The reason for this release? The existence of that VOC informs the blades of grass around that they are under attack, the blades then suck all of the sugars back from the leaves and down into the central root mass whilst also sucking water up from the roots and thus is prepared to sacrifice its extremities to the predator. This process makes the grass less palatable and thus tries to discourage the muncher of grass, encouraging it to move on seeking (if you'll excuse the pun) sweeter pastures. This allows the remaining grass in this area to survive. It’s a form of herd mentality based protection that we also see in animals - but as it can't run away, and it cannot cry or scream or react in a way that allows us to anthromorphise it's experience, thus it really mean it is not experiencing these things?  So many people sit there and relish the smell of fresh cut lawn, yet they never stop to think about the fact that when a lawnmower turns up, it isn’t the equivalent of a single lion pouncing on a scapegoat so much as the entire 13th Armoured Division screaming over the crest and letting loose on the entire herd. Thus the overwhelming screams (or in this case, VOCs) being released into the air that we then take an olfactory bath within.  Most places on Earth which contain life are visibly plantscapes. Whether you walk in human transformed habitats or in wilderness, human beings are far more likely to encounter plants than any other type of living being. In fact, the bulk of the visible biomass on this planet is comprised of plants.  From Charles Darwin’s early experimental work on the sensitive plant Mimosa pudica L., over a century of scientific observations contradict the notion that plants are passive, insensitive beings. Through nastic movements and tropic growth responses, plants have been shown for decades to display sensitive, purposeful, volitional behavior. Darwin’s most important work On the Origin of Species also implicitly contains the idea that humans and plants are indeed related by descent.  Plants are of course acknowledged as being different from human beings. They have different ways of going about their lives and have different needs from human beings. They deserve their own taxonomic category. However, there is no radical ontological schism between plants, animals, or humans. Plants are not zoocentrically dualised as inferior and are not placed at the bottom of a natural value-ordered hierarchy.  Further, if one was interested, it is both exciting and enlightening to follow recent developments in contemporary scientific research providing us with an ever increasing accrual of evidence demonstrating that plants have the physiology to support sophisticated mental activity, albeit, unlike that which we (nor pigs or dolphins) would experience.  As Darwin first discovered, there is increasing evidence that this intelligent behavior is directed by a multitude of brain like entities known as meristems. The work of František Baluška, Stefano Mancuso, and others in the nascent field of plant neurobiology is putting forward the notion that plants have sophisticated, decentralized neurosensory systems.  Buried within contemporary plant science literature is a growing awareness that plant behavior has many of the hallmarks of mentality. Such pioneering scientific work in many ways echoes the recognition of the attributes of sentience and personhood that have long been pinpointed in Indian religious thought and Indigenous knowledge systems.  The sceptic can of course ignore this accumulated knowledge and continue to exclude plants from moral consideration, but this option comes loaded with environmental consequences. Moreover, with an awareness that plants are autonomous subjects, continued instrumental exclusion must be viewed as deliberate disrespect at the very least.  By distancing ourselves from plants and denying their autonomy, we jeopardize a true sense of human identity, situatedness, and responsibility with nature and all life in general. The risk we run by ignoring the personhood of plants is losing sight of the knowledge that we humans are dependent ecological beings. We risk the complete severance of our connections with the other beings in the natural world — a process which only serves to strengthen and deepen our capacity for destructive ecological behavior.  To me, this is humanity’s worst type of violence and thus greatest ethical and moral imperative.  We return, again, to a concept that all food involves death. All life has a form of awareness and thus are sentient beings capable of feeling pain, and therefore is unable to be left as a blind-folded and guiltless meal.  I, for one, have my own ethics and morals that work for me and I am not, surprisingly, going to lecture you or anyone else on your choices as they relate to mine - however, I note that the Jains do embody a philosophy and moral code that tries to maintain a prominent inclusion of nonhuman interest within the sphere of human consideration, including, I may add, to actively seek affinity with plants. Significantly it allows plants space to flourish as plants without the same-said practices of farming, and thus fostering a nonviolence relationship with them.  Personally, I am not likely to go to that extent. I do believe that plant life is sentient, I do believe that it is a form of violence to take any life and that it is therefore important to remind myself that the key issue in the ethics of eating is the treatment of all life during its lifetime.  So, if we are going to debate this in any form of seriousness, we either have to agree we are no different than religious factions debating over some detail of minutia to claim moral superiority or we must re-engage the debate from a new angle."

For example, we know fairly certainly that pigs are quite intelligent and that they probably feel pain based on their brains and their responses.

philosophy,3bmcjz,nittick,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:02:17 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a great, nonsensical, perfectly encapsulated zoological centric speciesism response based on the very determinism I described is at work in this topic.   A biological response is not the same as feeling pain.   Do we return to a basic game of definitions and remind you that  the definition of ""pain"" is a signal of present or impending tissue damage affected by a harmful stimulus, and thus is experienced by almost all multicellular organisms? Do we remind ourselves that Descartes, who believed that only humans possessed self-consciousness, was unable to credit the idea that other animals could suffer from pain? Thus, he dismissed their screams and howls as mere biological responses and reflexes, as ""meaningless physiological noise""?  Is this not the very premise of the response you provided? The effective “no brain, no pain” argument is one that claims that as we can never determine with certainty whether plants feel pain or whether their perception of injury is sufficiently like that of animals to be called by the same word thus as we just don’t know, so we must be silent - which is pure philosophic, scientific and overall mental laziness at it's most base form.  Despite the problems, the study of sentience is one of the most important areas of biology and yet conclusive evidence that animals are sentient eludes us - thus evidence of what they want and how they see the world, which is increasingly open to us, is what is often used. Yet, utilising the same metrics for plants conjures up such opposition as to be laughable.  By these definitions, we should whole-heartedly and fiscally support the introduction of massive ocean farms to grow umpteen tonnes of oysters - an animal that has all the same level of biological response systems (and in many cases less) of plants. Thus, as a biological response is not the same as feeling pain, let's shuck away.   even if they do feel pain, solely eating plants would reduce the most suffering seeing as animals also eat plants.   Again, this is a great logical fallacy - since a great many animals also eat animals - do you then suggest we reduce the overall pain on the planet by wiping out any animals with predatory behaviours? Where is one meant to take this logical thought pattern?  Further, there is a danger that well-meaning people define animal welfare in terms of what they think animals want or what pleases them. If we are to take the concept and study of sentience seriously, we must ensure that an objective voice is heard. If one is thus being objective, then one must listen to the voices without the use of anthropocentric delineators to determine validity.  But, let us have a thought experiment on this now ...   If we were to flip the question and state that next week Monsanto released a new GMO that removed the feeling of pain from all bovines, will this make eating beef ok now? Any reaction they have is now purely a biological response as we have conclusively determined that through genetic manipulation, the bovine is incapable of feeling pain. Thus by this logic, we have eliminated the suffering and can continue to hold sunday rituals centred around the celebration of fire, sizzling, smoking and roasting.  The philosophy here is to debate the merits of logic and argument around a range of topics, and if you want to simply debate veganism versus omnivorism - well, then, are we not returning to the aforementioned religious debate in trying to define an ethical or moral stake in the fabric of reality that blesses the continuation of action A whilst condemning action B?  The interesting fact of the matter here is we are trying to unravel a very large topic where proponents are picking and choosing between utilising science and balancing them against a scale of mental illusions morals and ethics. Since this is fraught with a minefield of logical fallacies, it is important to determine any bias you may have and either acknowledge it, or make it a non issue by debating the very fabric of the philosophy and not some determination or interpretation.   To return to your original question around research. The issue is complicated for a number of reasons. The first is that whilst science is meant to be the ultimate pinnacle of objectivity, it is still practiced by humans, who, unfortunately, are not themselves able to hold such lofty goals.  Thus the research is either self-censored due to the influences of well meaning but ultimately flawed books such as ""The Secret Life of Plants"" by Tompkins & Bird published in 1973 or is even actively ridiculed in peer conferences due to the ""preposterous"" thought that plants could ever be classified in the same way as animals.   However, I do, indeed have a range of scientific material you can consider to consume:   “The Power of Movement in Plants” - C. Darwin, 1880 ""A Feeling for the Organism"" - E.F. Keller, 1983 ""Plant Physiology"" - L. Taiz and E. Zeiger, 2010 ""The Intelligent Plant"" - M. Pollan, 2013   Further, almost any of the work of the following researchers:     Monica Gagliano who specialises in Evolutionary Biology (Animal & Plant Behavioural Ecology) Elizabeth Van Volkenburgh who specialises in Agricultural Plant Science and Developmental Biology Suzanne Simard who specialises in Mycorrhizal Networks and Silviculture. Stefano Mancuso who specialises in Plant Physiology and Behavior. Heidi Appel who specialises in chemical & molecular ecology as well as plant-insect interactions. Richard Karban who specialises in Community Ecology, specifically the interactions between herbivores and their host plants. Edward Farmer who specialises in Plant Molecular Biology Kaori Shiojiri who specialises in Agricultural Plant Science Martin Heil who specialises in Botanical Molecular Biology   Finally, but by no means least, there is philosophical material as well:     ""Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany"" - M. Hall, 2011 Everything by Michael Marder who is the Research Professor of Philosophy at the University of the Basque Country, Vitoria-Gasteiz and has written extensively on plant ethics.

But, really, the chief problem here is the laziness of your argument.  Let's bust this shit like a chestnut.   It is all by agreement. The inherent rights of people are a ridiculously recent development in history that is now being extended to animals as arbitrarily as we bestowed this on ourselves.   No one is ""arbitrarily"" designing value systems. Pain is an undesirable, that's not arbitrary. We have the ability to empathise, and as such, extrapolate that just as our pain is unwanted more often than not neither is pain a desirable state for others. And their recent nature is not a relevant point of discussion; if I suddenly stop punching people in the nose, that doesn't mean (because of the suddenness of the decision) that it's a dumb decision to make and I should return to it.

The hypocrisy of saying animals have inherent rights when the inherent rights of actual HUMANS isn't even secured yet globally is shameful and shows just how decadent the west is.    I agree humans should prioritise one another over animals. But that's false equivalency, because no one here is saying ""fuck people, dogs is where it's at, yo."" And someone's wealth should not be a point of shame but one of wise investment rather than hoarding. I think saying ""well, you did good, but that's not the right good thing to do"" is a startling judgmental idea.

I'm not sure anyone here or in the article said anything self-congratulatory about their treatment of animals. I imagine it has to do with alternatives to eating meat exist, and therefore eating meat has become an irrelevance for those living in first-world countries.   Besides its all arbitrary.

Nevermind the wildly bigoted remark about Hindis, endangered animals are animals that may cease a genetic existence on this planet, hence their higher status than that whose genetic pool is much larger if not more diverse. You act like this is an abstract, hidden idea buried deep in gnostic texts. ""Endangered"" is well known to mean in this context ""Not a Whole Lot Left.""  A final statement. This whole diatribe swings wildly as a polemic back and forth, basically using really shoddy logic to argue for points no one's making as strawmen, and in the process just comes off as someone who is unwilling to admit:  1: Eating meat causes suffering (which is a fine, majority-level view to have) and  2: That suffering is outweighed by personal or social gains.

philosophy,3bmcjz,Pigapotamus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 03:04:13 2015 UTC,"This is not exactly my current stance on the subject but I was thinking:  Since we are part of the ecosystem, we have to kill animals at a normal human pace or else our traditional preys will over-populate then die of a long insufferable death from starvation after having themselves decimated their own preys, etc.   Ecosystems are fragile and are not resilient to sudden changes, therefore we should avoid changing our habits too quickly. This argument suddenly puts vegetarians as people that cause a lot of harm, quite funny."

People extend this reasoning to say things like nuclear weapons or artifical intelligence are unnatural, but technically, toilet paper and the harmonica are equally unnatural as those things certainly do not exist outside of humanity.   In common usage, people tend to refer anything associated with human technology as unnatural, although I tend to disagree with the implications of the way its used as in ""this isn't natural so its wrong to do"".

That isn't how nature works.   this is important too. Survival of the fittest right? But then again, both sides of the debate are certainly interested in conservation and I agree with them. If humans were going extinct, yeh, natural order of things and all that, but I have a feeling that we wouldn't mind if we got a little help. And there's the question, do animals deserve that help, like we would expect and certainly desire?   I think Pick wants a method of conservation that allows animals to continue existing, but with as little human influence as possible, allowing environments to exist for them so they can flourish, which we have arguably taken away. The guys (I feel bad for not remembering their names) want to continue the status quo and try to control the populations through direct means, that Pick feels we have no right to practice, and I think the biggest part of her argument is that it may not be necessary to do it that way and there are better more broad effective approaches."

So, for the safety of the four already in the raft - they did not allow the fifth to come on board.  The fifth ended up dying.  The justices involved actually used the exact same wording as you did - ""We are often compelled to set up standards we cannot reach ourselves, and to lay down rules which we could not ourselves satisfy.""  They were sentenced to death by a special verdict of guilt for murder.  I find this case interesting because it seems to state that self-preservation != self-defense in all cases, only in some.  After all, otherwise self-defense (safety of those on-board) would have prevailed and they wouldn't have been convicted.  Problem is, what is the distinction?  Does this actually still apply to the current laws?   What is the line that delineates self-preservation from self-defense?

Secondly complicity itself is not an absolute *thing, it has important degrees and nuances.

philosophy,3bkbei,WorldOfthisLord,6,Tue Jun 30 16:31:55 2015 UTC,"My main problem is when you start attributing guilt for wrong doings by association you are are(as much as I hate it) going down that ""slippery slope"" road, and going to have considerable trouble finding where the limit is.  The furthest end for example would be every single person on earth being 100% guilty of every action by every other person. That obviously is a bit ridiculous. Then you temper it by saying well.. limit it to things you can actually change...limit it to things you actually are aware about.  You can keep going on and on and you never end up at a satisfactory point.  Because of that I'm more in line with Singers idea. As an accountant, he had no personal interaction with the deaths, and could not directly influence them. Furthermore, if he left his job, he would of simply been replaced and nothing would of changed.  EDIT: A guard for example, that was aware of the killings and did everything in their power to prevent deaths (while still killing) is doing wrong, but at the same time I have serious difficulty putting blame on them or punishing them when if they simply refused and left, an even worse guard may replace them.

The point is as individuals with choice we can chose moral actions or not and incur responsibility that result, however the defence that others behaving immorally effectively eliminates your requirement to do so is no justification. Morality doesn't begin with what exists and then constructs a moral code around it (i.e. jews would have died anyway no matter what moral decision I make), but rather argues a position about what should exist and attempts to direct individual best in that direction (even if really existing conditions make the achievement of any moral choice hard). If you believe in a society where people don't participate in the murder of others then you at least begin with yourself with the hope that others follow, that they don't immediately for whatever reason doesn't absolve you if moral choice and morality is to have any meaning at all."

If he leaves, someone else – possibly worse – will be put in his place. To protest is fruitless and will only get him killed.""  Wow. That is some hardcore post-hoc justification. ""If your life is in danger, go ahead and act immorally. Besides, if you left or got yourself killed, it's possible that perhaps maybe the person who replaced you might be nasty and possibly do something evil, perhaps.""  ""Singer takes this position because he believes that whether an act is morally bad or good depends entirely on its consequences. If nothing else you can do will make things better for anyone then you can’t be blamed for wrongdoing.""  Um, okay? The consequences in this case were that the SS had a presumably-capable accountant. If every accountant refused to work for the SS, they'd've had major problems simply functioning on a daily basis. That Groening chose to provide them his services knowing what they were doing makes him culpable for aiding their deeds and thus, morally responsible.  I'm not saying this guy is wicked, I'm saying you have to perform some crazy mental gymnastics to pretend like he's innocent.  Singer's entire argument is abhorrent. The ""if I don't do it, someone else will"" mentality just leads to complacency; the kind of complacency that enables systematic oppression and worse.  ""But Singer’s moral philosophy differs from the views of most people about right and wrong. Most of us think that people are morally good if they act in obedience to moral rules – if they do not kill, cheat, betray or lie.""  Weasel words. And I don't like how the article is so biasedly portraying Singer as bravely defying common, unintelligent people. It's also creating a false dichotomy -- either you believe morality is based on the outcome of a persons actions and agree with Singer, or you believe like a sheep that morality depends on obeying a moral code and disagree with him.  I personally happen to believe very much that only a persons actions and the consequences thereof are of any moral relevance and I couldn't disagree more with Singer.  Who TF wrote this article and what's their agenda?  ""If Groening is guilty of anything he is guilty of complicity: of participating in the commission of a wrong. Complicity, as we usually understand it, requires participants to share an intention to do wrong. Members of a criminal gang are complicit in a murder if they act together with the intention to kill.""  What?! Says who? Since when? You absolutely do NOT have to intend to do wrong to be wrong, in any situation. How preposterous. Complicity is precisely being guilty regardless of your intentions -- if I know a woman is the victim of spousal abuse and I don't report it, I don't have to intend for her to be hurt to be culpable for failing to report the abuse.  Again I ask, who the heck wrote this article?  ""But Groening did not share the intention of killing Jews. He strongly disagreed with that objective. To find him guilty of complicity we have to accept that a person who works for an organisation that commits wrong can be complicit even if he morally objects to what it is doing and even if he doesn’t want to participate.  If you think that Groening is guilty then you should also agree that if you work for a company or bureaucracy that is committing injustices, then you are guilty of wrongdoing even if your own work makes no direct contribution to the wrong, and even if you do not approve of its unjust actions.  If you have no choice about where you work, or if you don’t know that your organisation is doing wrong, then maybe you have an excuse. Otherwise you share the guilt.""  Uh, yeah. That's exactly how it works. Why is the author presenting this as inherent absurd and making no argument for his case?  ""So let’s agree that Oskar Groening is morally guilty. But let us also consider the implications for our own participation in collective activities.""  Wait, what???

This is a point that is not made often in public debates, but is clearly the standard in philosophy. In one sense, it vindicates Robert's dissent, since it demonstrates that this ruling threatens to open the door to a host of other claims to marriage recognition by, for example, polygamists. Yet, on the other hand, it severely undercuts the entire premise of the conservative position, which is that the state should have any interest at all in what a marriage is or who should be married. However, once the state does get involved, it creates a sphere of privilege for a certain type of person (the type of person who can participate in 'marriage') and so the whole issue of what sorts of people can participate in that activity becomes a matter of fundamental liberties."

philosophy,3bidg3,OseanStratagy,29,Mon Jun 29 20:41:54 2015 UTC,"I maintain, consistent with the philosophers, that we've overlooked a much more fundamental question of the state's business in recognizing, regulating, and privileging marriage at all.   It's interesting that philosophers--almost writ large--question the government's involvement in marriage regulation. The entire reason the government is in the marriage business is to promote what they view as a socially beneficial institution. Marriages come with all sorts of tax breaks and benefits. The government does the opposite (cigarettes are a great example) when they want to deter certain behaviors.   To me the real question is not should the government be in the marriage business--but should the government be in the business of incentivizing/disincentivizing behaviors?"
philosophy,3bidg3,TheVangu4rd,16,Mon Jun 29 22:56:38 2015 UTC,"To your question, I would answer to some extent yes by definition.  It is a government's initial purpose, as with any institution, to preserve itself; then, its purpose is to grow and prosper.  Government being an entity that oversees and rules people needs, to a degree, to incentivize and disincentive behaviors.  While murder may be perceived as a moral and ethical wrong, governmental sanctions against murder convey a societal standard that is enforceable.  These sanctions serve to create the boundaries of the society government oversees.  But to incentivize or disincentivize some behaviors is not to do that for all of them.  I'm curious why the United States government views the institution of marriage as a socially beneficial institution that deserves incentivizing.  It seems this truth is assumed a priori by all the justices without questioning."
philosophy,3bidg3,worldmarble,11,Mon Jun 29 23:14:14 2015 UTC,"The government should not be concerned with preserving itself but preserving the life and liberty of its citizens. The government is not a magically separate entity (or at least, we shouldn't think of it as) above any other member of society and has no right to dictate worth, value, or morality by adjusting the cost of any item relative to its own interpretation. Protection of property rights including the right to your own body are not the same as manipulating costs by taxation or tax incentives.   Great point - what right does the government have to grant tax exemptions based on a religious ceremony or raising a family? Who is to choose what is the ""right"" choice for society? Consider for example how counterintuitive incentivizing large families is now, with global population growth causing untold stress on natural resources. Why continue to fund traditional families while simultaneously funding environmental controls and regulations which are ultimately necessitated by population growth and the traditional religious definition of family?"
philosophy,3bidg3,TheVangu4rd,7,Tue Jun 30 00:41:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't mean to suggest that governments should focus on self-preservation over the welfare of its citizens, but they do.  It's why all governments throughout history maintain militaries (to protect itself from without) and police forces (to preserve order within).  The degree to which these are separate, and the degree of authority with which they operate, varies.  In this instance, I'm not necessarily questioning what right the government has to or not to do the things they do like grant tax exemptions, but understand why as an entity seeking prosperity and preservation this course of action is perceived as beneficial."

But is it just because the state sees it as a socially beneficial institution?  Or is it also about a legally binding contract between two people that brings with it increased rights and responsibilities in the eyes of the state?  In other words, it seems to me that the state regulates marriages (or should) for mostly practical reasons, because it serves as a clear legal delineation between a less formal relationship and one that brings with it increased responsibilities to each other in the eyes of the law, in regards to inheritance, joint property, etc.  It's mostly an administrative concern and I feel that's how it should be.  If you take that away there are all sorts of legal issues that might arise that a marriage contract makes much easier to mediate legally.  It surprises me when people suggest the state has an interest in the moral dimension of marriage.  Beyond the politics, I've never seen it that way, to me it is obviously a purely administrative affair, evidenced by the fact that Satanists can marry, criminals can marry, etc.  For me it's a no brainer that, precisely because the state is only concerned administratively, same-sex couples should also be allowed to marry.  There's no administrative reason why they shouldn't."
philosophy,3bidg3,TheVangu4rd,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:59:16 2015 UTC,"So you're saying that the state should favor a legally binding contract between any two individuals (regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or criminal history) with increased rights and responsibilities?  If so, I don't necessarily disagree.  And you've offered the first case for why such a preferential contract has any benefit to the state such that the state has an interest in preserving and promoting it.  However, the substance of the opposition to same-sex marriages relies solely on moral dimensions with the assumption it is the responsibility (if not the obligation) of the state to maintain that dimension.  Many citizens of the United States seem to believe it is their government's job to enforce that moral dimension."
philosophy,3bidg3,hepheuua,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:08:12 2015 UTC,"But it doesn't seem to involve itself in the moral dimension, other than by arbitrarily saying marriage needs to be between consenting male and female only.  That's my point.  So if the argument is that the state should involve itself in the moral dimension of marriage, then why isn't it consistently applied?  Why don't we have regulations on the types of men and women that can marry?  Satanists, criminals, etc, they shouldn't be allowed to marry either, if our concern is really the moral aspect.  The state has always maintained its separation from the moral dimension of marriage and, other than the stipulation that it be between men and women, viewed it impartially and from a purely administrative standpoint."

Governments, by and large, at some point in their regime end up enforcing - either by force, economic incentive, cultural pressure, etc. - certain policies and decisions perceived to be for the benefit of the state for both its primary priorities (preservation and growth).  Specifically, the United States government in Obergefell v. Hodges affirms that marriage is perceived to be an essential (and ""pre-political"" one of the philosophers calls it) institution that, by virtue of the benefits conferred upon married couples not conferred upon non-married couples either pre- or post-marriage, is favored.  That favoring, along with the SCOTUS opinions, intimate marriage is a good thing for the United States.  But I think this point we already agreed on..."

The other issue I have with polygamous marriages is people may use it a means to bribe people from (again) third world countries just to make money off of them. Sure you can get married and divorced and do it over and over again, but polygamy would make it that much easier.   One might argue that both types of abuses happen today. But by limiting the number of marriages a person can have, we minimize those abuses. I guess if we did allow polygamous marriages, then the government should set some strict guidelines on mail order brides/grooms. When you bring people over, they would cost existing taxpayers money (i.e. healthcare). This would make it a political issue.

philosophy,3bidg3,Shuk247,4,Tue Jun 30 09:07:00 2015 UTC,"Exactly. At which point, their argument will be the same one used now, but once further down the chain. e.g. ""What next? Incestuous marriage and marriage with animals?"" Rather than starting with polygamy.  Incest is certainly an interesting question, though the animals one isn't until we find a way to consistently communicate between species.  On incest, the best argument against would be one regarding birth defect rate, but I doubt it would hold water as soon as you point out that 1st cousins' rates of birth defects are similar to women of age 40 having kids with birth defects.  At that point, yes, it's likely the supreme court will shrug and acknowledge that consenting adults can do whatever the fuck they want with each other and ought to have the same legal rights as possibly more ""conventional"" consenting adults."
philosophy,3bidg3,Janube,3,Mon Jun 29 21:02:21 2015 UTC,One argument against incest... at least within immediate family... is that it is largely redundant.  Many benefits of marriage recognition are already automatically extended to family members without any need for marriage.

How would taxes work in a marriage like that?  Should they be punished for having more money makers in a family?  I think that is a slippery slope most politicians won't want to touch for a long time.  I really think people should be allowed to do whatever they want to do as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else, but I think jumping from homosexual marriage to polygamy is a much farther jump, than just allowing gay rights.

At the end of it all what we may have actually accomplished is the removal of the institution of marriage rather than equality. I believe that many people with differing views on marriage will now feel empowered to gain the equality they feel they deserve. And with each new iteration of what marriage means and with each new broader and broader stroke the meaning of marriage will fade away. Pretty much any relationship will qualify for marriage and at that point there will be no reason to get married or give the institution any significance.

Specifically, most US Conservatives argue from a position of consequentialism whilst actually supporting Deontology.  The real trouble with Deontology is the fact that you ultimately have to base your ethical argument on absolutes for which there by definition can be no rational supporting basis. (This doesn't undermine Deontology. It merely states that we cannot know with certainty what the correct choice is. Deontology may be right, for all we know, but we may never be able to know. Not knowing something does not affect its truth value, it merely informs the credulity for the subjective agent proposing pronouncements based on the unknown.)

For me the real question is whether or not that state has a legitimate business in upholding and encouraging heterosexual marriage as an institution. I think it is correct to understand that hetero marriage between two people has been a fundamental principle of organization for western civilization for a long time. It seems to me all laws and morals are just about encouraging and discouraging behaviors we as a society either value or dislike respectively. So by not encouraging hetero marriage we will certainly be fundamentally changing our society. Whether for better or worse is the question.  An interesting counterexample here is pedophilia. As a society we do not give special privileges to pedophilics but rather we mercilessly hunt them down and throw them in jail. This is because we believe they are a threat to society and a threat to our children. But the Greeks did not see it this way. They thought it was a healthy relationship and good for both  the man and boy involved. So with this shift in perspective I think the real question is about what justifies any morality at all, and in particular what justifies the state in encouraging or discouraging any kind of behavior.  To answer questions about morality we run straight into the is/ought dichotomy. We must then recognize their is no moral authority to appeal to. There is only consequentialism and human reason and imagination."

How did you arrive at this conclusion? Why does it prove that heterosexual marriage is meaningless? Why does heterosexual marriage even have to be morally justified for it to be legally beneficial? Either way, why does this argument matter?  4) It's just generally bad taste to bring pedophilia to the table in a discussion about homosexual marriage, due to historical reasons. Not that there isn't a time and a place for this aspect of the framework, but I'd say you need to be pretty justified in bringing it up in order to not seem like you are conflating homosexuality with pedophilia... which I would argue that you failed to do because of point number 2.

Hmmm. I certainly never stated this. I myself am in a heterosexual marriage that means the world to me. I'm not sure where you got this idea from.    Why does heterosexual marriage even have to be morally justified for it to be legally beneficial?   Great question. This is the heart of the point I'm trying to make. Of course it doesn't need to be morally justified. The real question isn't what is morally justified, but merely what is beneficial legally for society... Hence my statement about consequentialism.   4) It's just generally bad taste to bring pedophilia to the table in a discussion about homosexual marriage, due to historical reasons. Not that there isn't a time and a place for this aspect of the framework, but I'd say you need to be pretty justified in bringing it up in order to not seem like you are conflating homosexuality with pedophilia... which I would argue that you failed to do because of point number 2.   I see your point here. I honestly didn't think about that and certainly didn't mean to offend anyone. The example was in the back of my mind after reading an interesting essay about queer theory. I chose pedophilia/hebephilia as an example precisely because it's such a great example of culture bring totally opposed to it, yet another culture makes an institution of sorts out of it.   Overall, this is kind of a strange, creepy comment that feels out of place. Are you a pedophile?   As I said I used pedophilia as an example because it is no more morally repugnant, per se, than homosexuality in my world veiw. Fifty years ago if I talked about homosexuality as an example you may well have thought that was creepy. So no I am not a pedophile but your comments serve to highlight why I used pedophilia as an example. It is irrationally hated and feared. Just admitting to, or expressing pedophilic desires is considered a sign of mental illness, just as homosexuality was not long ago, and still is in some places. The last point I want to make is that we can't move on to deciding what is best for society until we begin to move past the irrational basis of morality and legislation and begin basing it on scientific understand of individual happiness and human flourishing at a global level."

I was not aware of the correct term for that. To be clear I was not trying to equivocate between homosexually marriage and hebephilia or pedophilia. I wanted to use this example precisely because these behaviors/sexualities are illegal and socially unacceptable in our culture (just as homosexuality once was). I referred to ancient Greece as a counter example to show that various forms and institutions of sexual relationship are quite culturally dependent. What one time and culture calls a crime punishable by death another culture thinks is just dandy."

I think this argument may have made some sense in the past, like 100 years ago, when nearly everyone got married.  But these days something like 40% of people aren't married, so the idea that permitting 10% of them to marry someone they love isn't likely to change those ratios.

Also something to note is in a lot of these 'landmark' cases you are going to find complaints that the court is overstepping its boundaries. If there was established precedence in the past for the protections the court is ruling on, then they wouldn't be needing to rule on it now. So it mostly goes back to the age-old debate, which is not limited to law, between textualists who look only at the text and original intent and more liberal judges who take into account societal effects and things of that nature.

philosophy,3bidg3,MeganNancySmith,30,Mon Jun 29 17:33:08 2015 UTC,"From what I understood from all the news (not even close tothe horse's mouth mind you), his position was much like mine being:  No matter what you believe about marriage equality, the supreme court did several things with this decision that it was not designed to do:  First, it actually made a decision with no constitutional background. There is nothing in the constitution about marriage. Nothing at all. There also used to be nothing in there about women's suffrage. There was a democratic vote throughout all the states then existing, and we now have the 19th amendment. Basically, by deciding as such, rather than ratifying democratically, 5 out of 9 people appointed by various presidents (not even elected representatives) created a law that all people within the imaginary lines we call America now have to live by.  Second, I think I actually covered everything in my first paragraph, so I will just say this: the loose interpretation of the constitution is nothing at all new. For instance, there is nothing about marijuana in the constitution, but the constitutional foundation for these laws has always been the ""commerce clause"". Interestingly, alcohol, on the other hand, WAS prohibited by a ratification committee and REPEALED by a ratification committee. The reason this is all coming to a head now is that people naturally do not agree on things, and instead of being able to build smaller communities based on similar values, federal overreaches like are forcing everyone to conform at increasingly invasive levels, leading to unrest, and if the media were an animal, it would feed off unrest.  Edit: It seems that some people are having a hard time believing that anyone would think that the constitution shouldn't be open to any interpretation other than its original historical intent. The Internet is not mentioned in the constitution, nor do I think it need be (because I don't think the Internet should be legislated). If you start letting nine people just chosen by one man interpret the constitution in any way they please, anything is then able to be read into it at the expense of any semblance of democracy. Imagine that there was a world government (god forbid) and you got to vote for the world president who picked nine judges to interpret the world constitution. Imagine this president picked nine ISIS members for judges and the world congress approved them. Imagine they determined that America's constitutional right for two members of the same sex to marry was unconstitutional by the SCOTW's interpretation of the world constitution because of some clause from an amendment that was ratified after World War Two (civil war) in regards to the fair treatment of the Jews (former slaves). Would you not wish that you had ratified an amendment to ensure marriage equality in order to defend against this injustice. Or at least would you not concede that it would be better if such an amendment were put to a vote to ratify it? Or even better yet, would you not wish that America could just deal with it's own affairs much as a state might do?  I am all for marriage equality. I'm not even a constitutionalist nor do I believe that democracy is a halfway decent system, but if you are willing to let 5 out of 9 people dictate policy for an entire nation, regardless of the outcome, than you are subjecting yourself to an oligarchy.  That's fine by me, but please don't include me in your ""social contract"". I didn't sign shit."

Your rights are not supposed to depend on what the majority wishes to grant you through their precious 'process'.   The Judiciary has a function - to review the actions of the other branches against what is and is not permitted via the relevant founding documents and the centuries of precedent between then and now.

In recent decades, the 14th Amendment has repeatedly been used to strike down laws that treat men and women unequally.

philosophy,3bidg3,-Themis-,6,Mon Jun 29 16:51:40 2015 UTC,"In Germanic world a marriage was a contract between families. When protestantism emerged the churches demanded the official part. Before protestantism a simple oath was sufficient. After the french revolution the role of the church was replaced in parts of Europe. Since most marriages were a simple contract for economical support and for sex. Many marriages were violent and women had no right to do business. A man who had another relationship knew that his wife is nothing without him. The wish for something better was strong. Romantic magazines arrived on the marked.   With the introduction of compulsory military service the progeny became interesting for the state. France drafted right after the revolution common people and Prussia introduced the service after the Napoleon wars. The children of the families were already in the school prepared for a patriotic service. They weren't longer just peasants, they were important for the upcoming wars! The culmination of the development were medals for 5 children in Germany after 1933 to let them die in the fire of WW2.   After the 2nd World War the rights of woman in Western Europe were clear. The old traditions in the west lived on. While socialistic countries provided services like the kindergarten to get more children, was the capitalistic west more conservative. Both side got less children after the introduction of the pill. The churches had a huge influence and even in the 60s it was impossible in parts of Europe to get a hotel room for a unmarried couple or sleep together in a room provided by friends  because it was a crime. The roles were clear. The woman has to take care for house and children. The marriage should gave the contract something special, an emotion, even when one of the spouses was an asshole. The cases of bankruptcy after a sanctioned relationship was divorced are legion.    We have at least 4 reasons for a official sanctioned relationship in the past:    Materialistic support Sex Children A good relationship between 2 families   This doesn't include love as emotion, with good reason. Love as reason wasn't usually seen as an important value, because a marriage had always a political function. This has changed, at least in parts of Europe and the US. A couple isn't necessary registered.   A working relationship is working because it is for all parts a well being linked with a positive emotion. The question here is, when I have such a relationship why should I register my relationship? Why should a government interfere with my private life? In a free society, there are relationships. Some are lasting a lifetime, others lasting months or days, like today, but without the consequences of harming parts of a relationship, by removing the base for a living. People changes over time and so many relationships. People should be free to get into and get out of relationships when they wish. So many laws about relationships can't change the reality of changing people.   The decision of the supreme court may be a symptom for a society who changes, but the ecstasy about the decision isn't justified. The movement of homosexuals wants the license to life together instead of insisting on a harassment free life and live together as long as they want."

All the legal consequences of marriage (such as entitlements) would either become irrelevant or just disentangled from marriage.  Default rules might have to be redrafted; but simple things like intestacy can simply be amended such that stuff would be left to biological kin, and if none, just the state for example. [but then seeing the current trend, some might make the argument that biological relationships are no longer important, then the default rules could just be leaving it to the state.]  All in all imo as it stands marriage is just used as a convenient marker for the state to identify relationships between people which makes administration simpler.   Even procreation isn't really limited to heterosexual couples, I suppose gay people could just find willing people to help out. Being gay per se doesn't prevent a person from having babies.  There's already single parents, gay parent(s) etc; even the remaining distinction that heterosexual couples raise babies of their own can simply be answered by saying that it's open for a gay couple/person to raise the child with the other biological parent.   I mean ultimately a child has no say as to whether he/she wanted to be brought into this world. I suppose some would make the argument that because of that, why distinguish among children brought up by both biological parents, gay parents, single parents, adopted parents, guardians (orphans for example)."

(And I highly highly recommend that you do both, if you haven't yet, even if you are young.)   thanks for the reply. I will admit that I haven't given deep thought to the issues you have raised.  To use what you have said, let's say we talk about property and intestacy, suppose just for this issue the rules are if you don't express an intention as to how you want your stuff to be dealt with once you pass, the state gets all of it. That would be an incentive for people then to start writing wills, and making sure they're watertight [for example, a national register of wills].  In saying the foregoing, I make no cost-benefit analysis, especially in terms of economics. I say this because it would seem like if that were the route ahead, it would be kinda messy and lotsa money be spent on compliance blah blah I don't know, it's beyond me. I just posed it as a thought experiment so people can draw parallels to other issues. e.g. for other issues, when society relegates 'marriage' to a historical concept, the law may still draw inspiration from the elements that defined a marriage and continue to apply some of those elements on a case-by-case basis to disputes. Or it could simply be like the intestacy issue, a matter of contracts, assignments, and obligations. And for other issues, like custody for example, it's always going to what's in the child's best interest.  Intestacy laws around the world are not the same; so I would think culture and history contribute to that difference. Thus, for all I know, if there's a post-marriage society, a person who had a partner and had children (whether with that partner as biological parent or otherwise) might not even see it as odd that the default rules require his/her stuff to go the state. Maybe in that society, relationships just aren't what we think they embody in the current society.  Again, in saying all of this, I take no position really, it's just fun to think about it."

While the general rule is that if the intestate dies leaving a spouse, no issue and no parent, the spouse is entitled to the entire estate.   However in Singapore if the intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse and issue, the spouse is entitled to one-half of the estate. If the intestate dies leaving a surviving spouse and no issue but a parent or parents, the spouse is entitled to one-half of the estate and the parent(s) are entitled to the other half of the estate. etc This is similar in Taiwan.  In China, spouses, children and parents have equal priority.   Thus, one proposition is that: some cultures place more emphasis on parents and children.  And for Muslim intestacy [countries with significant Muslim populations], it's a lot more different as well. Males are given 2 shares of the estate to every share given to his female counterpart. [oh and you have to be Muslim]  in other words, culture plays a greater part than what you may have implied.   But I do think it's unrealistic to upset a system that would require rewriting swaths of law, and creation of ""necessary"" contracts.

Because if government has any religious bias then it is alienating it's own citizens who may have opposing idealism from whichever church or religion the government favors, which defeats the purpose for government. The government's main responsibility is to protect the rights and freedoms of it's people, to provide agreeable laws on how it's citizens behave in society that does not include things such as a person's personal sexual orientation or identity (beyond the purpose of records). Unions such as marriages are tricky, because of wording.

It would therefore be in the interest of said government to subsidize those individuals because they strengthen the (future) tax base. That being said, this opinion isn't saying that same-sex couples can't strengthen the future tax base just because they can't have children, they can just as easily adopt and so forth; the connection to the recent SCOTUS ruling is that those same-sex couples are now protected in those rights in those narrow aspects of marriage."

I'm pretty sure the legal side of things is what everyone was after. That's why I made the distinction between the two. My point was that the terms gay marriage and marriage equality were misnomers, and people already had that figured out a while ago. I was saying that I doubted the bigots would have been quite as angry about two members of any gender on whatever spectrum wanting the same legal rights - ""civil union"" - as a man and a woman. My point, though, was that the state wasn't and should never be allowed to tell any two people (or three or seven I guess) that they cannot promise to spend the rest of their lives together.

Similarly, a man and a woman in a sexual union present the possibility for procreation.  The generation of a new human being with presumably equal rights is a big deal.  It's so important, it could justify a lot of laws, social norms, benefits, etc to prepare for it.  Inequality is justified here.

philosophy,3bidg3,RedditSpecialAgent,4,Tue Jun 30 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"The question of heterosexual infertility or sterility is answered quite clearly in much of the serious literature opposing same-sex marriage, which strongly suggests you haven't taken the time to read it.  An understanding of marriage related to procreation does not necessarily imply an understanding of marriage directly and exclusively oriented towards procreation as an end. In fact, in the influential Thomist natural law philosophy of Finnis and Grisez, desiring procreation as an end is morally dubious because it reduces human persons to mere means or instruments for the satisfaction of a personal desire for parenthood - this is also the basis of Catholic opposition to contraceptives and family planning.  Marriage, rather, is understood in this account as a legal institution enabling marital sex acts - namely, exclusive acts of intimacy entered into by committed partners to realise their one-flesh union and entered into with an openness towards (not an aim or desire for) procreation. Heterosexual sex acts are essentially open to procreation while homosexual sex acts clearly are not. In this sense, heterosexual unions are always candidates for marriage on this account regardless of contingent circumstances as long as both partners maintain an openness towards procreation. Homosexual unions are not candidates for marriage because they cannot be open to procreation out of binding biological necessity.  This is better elaborated in 'Marriage: A Basic and Exigent Good' by John Finnis, which all intelligent people who wish to comment on this issue owe it to themselves to at least read and grapple with."

As long as we pretend that trans and intersex people do not exist, which would be silly in this context, given that ""traditional"" marriage laws tend to put many of them in particularly difficult situations.   Marriage, rather, is understood in this account as a legal institution enabling marital sex acts   But that isn't what the legal institution of marriage is, in any legal system I am aware of.  We do not insist that married couples have sex, we do not encourage them to have sex, we do not even insist that they need to be capable of having sex, and we don't try and prevent people from having extra-marital sex.  Marriage laws even tend to have specific features that benefit couples in circumstances where they could not possibly have sex, such as survivor benefits and exemptions from inheritance tax.

philosophy,3bidg3,flyinghamsta,2,Thu Jul 2 13:06:40 2015 UTC,"What is marriage? This first must be established before one can debate what he or she thinks is the right decision in the court ruling. First, it must be noted that this ruling was about same-sex marriage not gay marriage. This is an important distinction because gay marriage would be a marriage between two homosexuals. As of right now (and even before Friday) marriage held no discrimination against your sexual orientation. Before Friday two homosexuals could get married as long as they are of opposite sexes. It did not discriminate between sexual orientations.  Marriage did not discriminate because it only pertained to a man and a woman.  So it is my understanding that both sides of this argument would say that the traditional view of marriage has been between a man and a woman. To allow for same-sex marriage then the definition must change. The question now shifts to if we have the right/power to change the definition. Let's operate under the assumption that we do have the ability and right to change the definition. If we do have this right/power, then two important questions must be raised. When do we change the definition? What constitutes an appropriate reason to change a definition?  These two questions are subjective by their very nature. What I think is a good time and reason will most likely never match the same as any other person. So how then do we decide? As of right now, we operate under wise men and women who we have elected to represent our best interests. This is fine but we must be willing to live with the consequences that might arise with this. Suppose we live in a parallel world in which the Axis powers had won WWII. After domination they subsequently wiped out any that opposed their ideals. In this scenario their racism and cruelty would be justified according to the previous logic I presented. Someone made the point on this reddit post that we won't start catering to special interests groups because they are too small. I think that is a weak argument. That is discrimination based on size of a number of people. It is what our society has been fighting for some time.  I know there is still a matter of religion and its place in all of this. While I do think it does have a place in this, I thought it better to steer clear of it in this post.

The most obvious example I can think of is the whole structure of Hannah Arendt's On Revolution where she makes a long philosophical objection to the thinking behind the French Revolution in favour of the American political tradition, but then explicitly asks if the American Revolution doesn't also fall under the same Revolutionary thinking, and proves that it does not."

The way I've always looked at it, the mind finds words of a sort of marvellously complex dictionary, where not only are words sorted alphabetically, but also one can go from one word to the next by the middle letters - by a 'v' in common perhaps, or a double-'o' - or even by a place one has once encountered both the first word and the next ('propaedeutic, for example, -and though I will probably never remember what it means -, will always be accompanied in my mind by the word 'apodetic', being that I read both at the same time in my youth, and they both stand as if some ill-remembered foes who defeated me of a certain book).…And it gets much more complicated than all that, too, for indeed not a single word you utter is not in some way related to the last. I mean, it’s not like you were pulling them out of thin air, right? And so to be ‘poetic’ or ‘lyrical’ might have more meaning than one might first think. Indeed, what even is it to be ‘poetic’ in the first place? Merely rhyming words? But where is the charm!  I think it is in providing one’s reader with a sort of elegant traversing of what one has written. That is, that something need not rhyme, as we would commonly conceive of something rhyming….to rhyme! That words need not be lyrical to be put to a tune. That the tune need not be heard to be appreciated. And so forth.  Or that’s what I take it to mean anyhow. It's definitely something that a lot of writers have pondered on, I think, the sort of inherent poetry of words. I think Joyce's Ulysses is actually largely a play on it, actually. (For me, of course, it would be the inherent rigidity of words, not poetry of them =P). Perhaps that's all a little psychological and not philosophical, though."

philosophy,3bfc7q,StudentRadical,4,Sun Jun 28 20:40:07 2015 UTC,"Doesn't poetry refer to some kind of linguistic gymnastic and rhythm?   Well, for one simply stating things truly and clearly as opposed to just repeating common sentiments is difficult if you're doing it correctly (Hawthorne said most difficult style is to write things simply without thinking simply) and will involve a lot of linguistic work. Nietzsche is really quite adept at this, to the point where a lot of his statements about previous philosophy have entered into common knowledge, and people know them without knowing Nietzsche said them.   Mathematics and Logic also deal with abstractions but have nothing to do with poetry.   But those two are strictly abstractions. You're not talking (except in Logic quite a bit) about how abstractions deal with daily life and situations. It's one thing to talk about the life of multiple trees and humans being the same thing, and that this relates to time and the Universe. It's another to talk about how we come to perceive that as life, or how understanding that principle can give us insights into our lives. That's partly what drives me crazy with the self-satisfaction of a lot of Modern Art; it's simply abstracts knocking against each other in some universe I can't access.   Can you develop about those important ways?   The first philosophers in Greece wrote entirely in poetry and thought of themselves as heirs to the Greek Lyrics (Paramenides particularly frames his entire philosophy as his encounter with a goddess who instructs him about the Universe). Platonic philosophy basically is commentary on Drama and Poetry. The earliest Jewish and Arabic philosophers were basically commentators on scripture, and we still use a lot of their concepts (particularly Maimonides concept of Anthropocentrism). /u/shannondoah pointed out the direct link between Indian philosophy and scripture, and the Ancient Chinese can hardly think of illustrating a concept without immediately relating a poem about it (I say this in great admiration; in fact the Dao de Jing is written entirely in verse)."

If I follow you correctly: we can have a rigorous speach when thinking about the universe but poetry may be appropriate when thinking about our perceptions and experiences?  Thanks for the precisions about the first forms of philosophical writings. Poetry was also used in mathematics but, at the time of Nietzsche, it was not the dominant format (if it ever was!).

But there's a lot of extremely useful, if not essential human knowledge that is not entirely validated and exists only as models for how humans behave on a ""validation"" level. That's what most of philosophy is. There's not a specific area of your brain clearly labeled ""cognition"" that is looking at these words and interpreting them based on stencils in your brain cells, but there is something called ""cognition"" that we can trace both to modern neuroscience and to philosophy both ancient and modern in a piece-meal way. Same with the Ego, the sociological category of Resentment, patriotism, anti-patriotism, and Justice. And these things are certainly worth talking about.   ... what about Nietzsche in this case?    Nietzsche wasn't a logician, even in his ""positivist"" stage (Daybreak and Human, All too Human). If anything, he thought the point of science was to open up a space new human capacities that might be possible by stating things observationally, and leaving descriptions of capacities to philosophy and poetry.   Anyway, saying ""poetic should have nothing to do with philosophical writing""   The point is that poetry is tightly wound up with philosophical tradition everywhere, and a lot of philosophy even today is based on the parsing out of poetic works. Even if the point is to say ""the poet was wrong here, and represents only generic opinion"" or ""this proof works as a poetic hope, but not in reality"" like Stephen says about Plato himself in Ulysses.  There were a few Latin mathematicians that wrote treatises in verse, like Marcus Manilius.  I think the problem might be what you think is poetry and what it isn't. We aren't trying to come up with a Perfect Society based on parsing out The Owl and the Pussycat forever, but things like the role of Art in society in Geoffrey Hill's ""An Apology for the Revival of Church Architecture in England""   Thanks again for the references.

I can see them as important to point out some issues in human language (false oppositions for exemple) but not as truth statement.   But mathematics itself is full of paradoxes that are likewise extraordinarily helpful for understanding some of its most important concepts.   But the question was, why poetically?    Oh, I think I see now. My point was not that philosophy needs to become poetic, but that it could use analysis of poetry as a springboard for critique of other topics. Indeed, Wittgenstein's notebooks are chock-full of analysis of poems that struck him, and the Philosophical Investigations is full examples from his deep knowledge of British and German literature to illustrate different types of usage of words or grammar. Schopenhauer is constantly using phrases from Shakespeare for similar purposes.  Continental Philosophy under Heidegger did try to renovate philosophy into a kind of poetry, but it basically resulted both in his career and in that of his followers in work that is neither poetry nor philosophy.   I meant that he was mad at some point, no?   Kind of, he certainly had a mental breakdown towards the end, but it's unclear what it was from, or how long it was affecting his work. I usually avoid talking about ""madness"" simply because I'm afraid of where I might be put on the spectrum. Chesterton said most ""mad"" poets were the ones that most gravitated to the most strict rhythms and difficult problems.

You could study ""literaturwissenschaft"", which we would call literary studies, or ""sprachwissenschaft"", AKA linguistics. Biowissenschaft is a general term for the life sciences(but Biologie, a pretty easy cognate, is more commonly used for Biology).   I don't know a whole lot about the German higher education system, but it would be interesting to find out whether this lingusitic difference affects how their academic fields are divided."

Most English courses that take that route are basically the student's first introduction to actual analytic interpretation in literary contexts. It makes sense to go a little overboard.   Not to mention this whole ""insignificant detail blown to significance!"" often just completely misconstrues the context. Yes, one page that mentions ash on The Road isn't symbolic evidence that McCarthy is using ash to denote death or decay - though it might be. What makes it symbolically relevant is how ash comes up on nearly every page. It's about extended metaphors.  The colour of the curtains becomes a lot more relevant if it fits into a wider colour scheme that's being used. Pretty weird example but look at Deus Ex HR - the curtains being gold means nothing independently but it gathers symbolic meaning through the extended metaphor of, well, golden everything."

Let that thought simmer for a while.   This is the kind of ""non-ideal theory"" about the world that actually exists amongst people who do not set themselves up as theorists and haven't heard of Rawls. I would be hesitant to open up philosophy to such ""marginalized perspectives"" on the basis that it would help to capture the richness of human experience. I can only imagine such ignorance would be detrimental to the profession. There is a reason for the distinction between lay-people and professionals, not least of which is education and sophistication in thinking.

When it comes to mathematics as a source for deep results on reality, I think some books on modern physichs are great. I enjoy Hawkings' ""A Brief History of Time"" and also ""Hyperspace"" by Michio Kaku, which focuses on the beauty of physics. For less ""serious"" popular-science, I would recommend Hawkings ""Baby universes and other essays"" which is simple to read and concerns mostly his own life - it is surprisingly well-written, but its content diverges somewhat from what you are asking for.  Otherwise, I would argue that simply learning some more mathematics is a great source of understanding.

Even Isaac Newton had a philosophical approach of using abstract logic followed by inventing algebra to explore the ideas.   Lately modern physicists have declared philosophy obsolete in this field as what we find is considered beyond intuitive reasoning where pure thought can no longer contribute.   Granted philosophy has much influence and use in human science but if considered to no longer be human science I would call it a return to its origin.

That may be the case, but it is arguably the case only because none of the different domains of inquiry were clearly distinguished: Aristotle wrote about math, biology, the soul, metaphysics, ethics, etc. Or, to put it another way, the humanities and hard sciences were much more closely associated than they are now.   The ancient greeks philosophers contributed mostly to math and physics by pure thought. Even Isaac Newton had a philosophical approach of using abstract logic followed by inventing algebra to explore the ideas.   I'm not sure either of those statements is particularly accurate, historically speaking. One of the main contributions of the Greeks, mathematically-speaking, was the recognition that what we are interested in were triangles as a type, not imperfect human representations of them. But another major contribution was the empirical science of Ptolemaic astronomy, from which all mathematical sciences eventually bloomed. As for Newton, well, one he didn't invent algebra, and two, I'm not sure that ""abstract logic"" is really the best way to characterize his approach."

Classical philosophy is much broader than that, including logic, epistemology, metaphysics (time, space, and perception), reality, and so on.   Think about the importance of things like proofs, understanding, education, perception of time, understanding of perception - in dealing with the results that physics or astronomy or engineering give us. My desk is mostly empty space; my hand is mostly empty space. When I put my hand on my desk, what I ""feel"" is the repulsion between two fields of electron clouds.

NASA often artificially colors images of nebula. They do not create any information - all they are doing is adding hue to information that's there (for example, tinting infrared).

The point with respect to Pluto and success is that you need to be able to identify the conditions that embody the word while still reflecting other uses of it.

Were doctors somehow less valuable then? It also may not be something the market can internalize. Did you ever wonder why public school is free? It's not because it's worthless.

I cant believe you are genuinely that dense that you think peoples needs are not related to what people are willing to pay, its about as basic as economics gets, and you seem to not understand this.  people dont need and are not prepared to pay for philosophy outside of academia it is and remains a nonsense qualification where you can think ""deep thoughts about being unemployed"""

To who is food more valuable than tarot card readings? Is that the case all the time? After a certain point, are you sated with food and then will purchase tarot card readings? Are there people who desperately believe in tarot cards and would skip a meal to make sure they can buy from that market?  Of course people link what they need and what they want. But you seem to think these are the same rather than just connected, and that they're universally held and constant. You would pay more for a bottle of water if you were thirsty than if you weren't. Kids skip meals and save lunch money to buy video games when they should probably be eating instead. Is there a reason that a teacher's salary is low while an athlete's is enormous? We certainly don't need football players, but we want them.  People do an enormously large number of things where they make subordinate their ""needs"" for ""wants,"" and if that statement makes me a terrible economist in your opinion, you're clearly not well versed in this field.

It refers to how we perceive the all things and then categorize them in our own ways which is why philosophy can always be debated. The only throw out are facts of our universe but even an alien may perceive those same facts differently to us e.g time\gravity.

Science still rests upon it. Example: the basic premise that if the result of an experiment is the same 1000 times, therefore it will be the same times 1001. This is a philosophical axiom. There is no way to prove it. We just assume that it's true. Otherwise, science doesn't work."
philosophy,3bdmfa,DefinitelyNotJC,-1,Sun Jun 28 14:01:31 2015 UTC,"I've always thought Philosophy, at it's essence, is one of the purest disciplines of knowledge. If we have to have a hierarchy of disciplines, Philosophy belongs at the top as it is a 'purer' discipline than physics and even maths at times. Of course I'm not talking about normative theories and stuff here, even though these are all inherently based on that pure foundation; Logic goes hand in hand with maths, all physics and science in the modern world is predicated on philosophical axioms like Euclid's.  Philosophy being such a vague descriptor for a discipline often encompasses some more 'airy-fairy' stuff but this can frequently be dismissed as 'bad philosophy'. Even empirical doctrine's like Hume's require logical extrapolation and aren't just loose descriptions of things happening.  Wheels turn in the real world, and Philosophy aims to explain why the wheels turn. Science is nothing without theoretical logic, which is the heart of philosophy.   This isn't just a long winded way of saying that what philosophy does is harder or more important that disciplines like maths and physics, but more that it addresses a fundamental layer DEEPER than those disciplines. Philosophy is only an art insofar as Maths can be done beautifully."
philosophy,3bdmfa,Indigo_Shoes,7,Sun Jun 28 14:46:30 2015 UTC,"Science is in fact very conscious about defining what is and is not proven as well. This misunderstanding is is why the term theory was so scrutinized during debates over evolution. There is a kinship between science in philosophy in that both attempt to find their most solid working models, so to speak. These models are subjected to a great deal of scrutiny and debate, and those that remain do so not because they are proven, but because they are the greatest that is available for their area of discussion. Where the two differentiate is that philosophy is more willing and able to engage in the abstract, which does place it just a notch shy of the idealized version of scientific credibility. Proof however cannot have the final word, as even gravity remains unproven."

Philosophy is more willing and able to engage in the abstract? This comment is completely absurd. Physics is dominated by the abstract, which is why it's so difficult for the layman to comprehend. A ridiculously complicated system of logic (mathematics) is required to understand and explain it. Even people with decades of experience in the field lack the training required to fully understand the topics of many subfields outside their own specialty.   Proof however cannot have the final word, as even gravity remains unproven.   Gravity is not unproven; it is a fact. Gravity exists insomuch as we can say anything exists. The theory behind  what's causing the force of gravity is probably what you're referring to, but it is intellectual masturbation to say that it is not ""proven"". The evidence is overwhelming. Can we definitively prove, without a shadow of doubt, that some other unknown theory is not the Truth with a capital T? Of course not, but we must work within the limits of our reason.  Philosophy does not fall under the umbrella of science, because it is not a science. Science is a branch of philosophy, not the other way around."
philosophy,3bdmfa,Indigo_Shoes,8,Sun Jun 28 05:51:14 2015 UTC,"Your points are well taken, but it seems theatrical that we can't have a discussion without declaring something ""absurd"". A simple adjustment of definitions would have corrected your entire argument, and saved you a bit of time as well.  Yes, science deals in the abstract. Of course this is true, as abstraction is a key element in solving any problem. I did not intend to speak of this sort of abstract, but rather that some of philosophy's schools are not as suited to maths, such as ethics or metaphysics. Yes, even these can contain mathematical arguments, but such arguments are not necessary for their discussion, making them by some measure more abstract than, say, an experiment about the affects of light on a species of bacteria.  As for gravity existing without a shadow of a doubt, again, I find it difficult to believe that anybody would argue. I hope it was clear enough that what I was referring to was the theory therein. This distinction is important, as many don't understand the value and weight of the term theory, and so believe that science may only be science if it is concrete and proven. I think we both understand that the opposite is true.  But we've both intellectually masturbated quite enough now. I will say that I really enjoyed your distinction about science being a branch of philosophy, and I mean that, but as for the rest, I can't help but think you saw my comment and decided you were going to be smarter than somebody today.

That was far from my intention, and I apologize if it came across that way; nor was it my intention to insult your intelligence. I just think that to claim that philosophy deals with more abstraction than science is to misunderstand science, as a very, very large portion of it is abstraction. There are many areas of science where mathematics is not only necessary to describe them but is actually the only language in which the concepts can be understood. This is why the descriptions of many scientific concepts intended for the layman are woefully inadequate and easily misinterpreted. I would certainly not say that I'm ""smarter"" than anyone else, but at risk of being interpreted as an appeal to authority, I would definitely say that, as a physicist, I am much more knowledgeable about science than the average person. Unfortunately, in my experience, the average person gives themselves far too much credit regarding their own understanding of science."

Some philosophers succeed because they come up with devastating responses to the work of other thinkers.  This was not Neitzche.

He does make a few arguments -or descriptions- as to why he does that. If I recall correctly, in Human All Too Human he says that he prefers ideas to be described incompletely, to leave to the reader the task of filling them out. In Ecce Homo he stresses that each of us only knows what each of us has lived, and thus we all interpret all texts against our own background and context. And through all of his work he stresses that all knowledge is perspectival knowledge, and we must make an effort to build our own perspective, and that requires that we take nobody's words for things, not even his... and thus, he makes wild assertions that contradict themselves two paragraphs later, because none of those assertions are meant to be anything than descriptions of a perspective, and perspectives are, by nature, riddled with error..."

I don't think Germany of the late Holy Roman Empire would have tolerated his subversive ideas unless Napolean had forced the ideas of the French revolution into its collective awareness. Its no coincidence that Marxism developed in the mid-late 1800s in Germany also.  The German intellectual scene was radically, suddenly tolerant of dangerous ideas - and that tolerance reflected a hunger for such ideas and his work was particularly dangerous.  The world was primed for a Neitzche, and they got him."

Marx's journalistic work was censored in Germany. His theory clashed with the intellectual climate, hence his writing of works like The German Ideology. His academic work was marginalized throughout the nineteenth century, and his political views weren't terribly popular: socialist thought predated Marx, and Marx simply didn't have a terribly large impact in Germany or France. Marx was completely financially dependent upon Engels, who was successful in business. Marx was no success.  Ditto with Nietzsche. His Untimely Meditations were considered untimely. He was ridiculed by other philologists for The Birth of Tragedy. He was far from a celebrity during his lifetime; he achieved more notoriety when his thought was twisted by the Nazis, but someone as elitist and critical of the times as Nietzsche just isn't cut out to be a popular figure."

That's like saying if someone invented the wheel today it wouldn't be a big deal because we already have the wheel. It's beyond sloppy reasoning. And he argued a great deal.

Or his relentless attacks on religion, to be replaced by value positing."

He so often stresses the living of life for passion and gives compelling suggestions, at least in Thus Spoke Zarathustra.  Let's ask Nietzsche whether he was cynical: ""Cynicism is the only form in which base souls approach honesty.""  Edit: Oh, doc never even said Nietzsche was cynical.  I misread the comment."
philosophy,3bc7yu,yundying,2,Sun Jun 28 05:46:33 2015 UTC,"I do think that he is cynical in that he seems to assert that human nature is vulnerable to a lot of traps - such as Christianity.  I agree that he pushes the reader to value people who have a lust for life.  The ""blonde beast"" and nobility are both described as being full of cheer.  Mirth is a mark of a higher person to Nietzche - as certain concerns that plague common people (or the complexities involved in manipulating them) are depicted as real downers.  Both pity and the desire to control people are sources of gloom.  The strongest people aren't beholden to those concerns - so they are free to smile."
philosophy,3bc7yu,drfeelokay,2,Sun Jun 28 06:19:36 2015 UTC,"Ill agree that the Birth of Tragedy contains a lot of argument, but his work as a classist/philologist just don't have the same historical import as his later ideas (although there certainly are a lot of connections between his early and later work).  When I called him less argumentatively-inclined I was comparing him to other philosophers.  Compared to the larger community of writers, I wouldn't call him non-argumentative.  I don't think your wheel argument is convincing.  Certainly, thinkers vary on how era-dependent the acceptance of their ideas was.

Not necessarily.  I think that he is beyond question but I'll let others make those arguments."

philosophy,3bc7yu,CollumMcJingleballs,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:30:17 2015 UTC,"I've thought about this topic myself, being an avid Nietzsche fan and having spoken to many others who feel the same way I do about the Nietz and many others who feel the opposite.  Nietzsche is a bit of a mystery.  His influence is vague, diffuse, and hard to trace.   We can point to Nietzsche's influence in the writings of other philosophers, in pop culture references, in certain ""attitudes"" of his that have become prevalent in radical movements of all types... But though we can dig in this well indefinitely, we'll never come to even one ""authoritative"" idea. Nietzsche isn't rubber stamped with any one, clear, timeless idea the way Freud or Darwin is. His influence is always in the spirit rather than the specifics of what he wrote.  One clue as to Nietzsche's reception may lie in an apparent weakness of his philosophy:  Nietzsche never really stated any of his positions too clearly, they were always stated tentatively with a huge disclaimer--""This MAY be the case""--hanging over them.   Simplistic people would see this as a weakness but I really see it as the biggest strength of his project. Nietzsche was a philosopher who knew the weaknesses of philosophy. He knew that philosophy could never develop a ""system"" the way the sciences could (see, e.g., ""the will to a system is a lack of integrity""). He knew all too well philosophy's tendency to present idealistic fairy tales as definitive truths, and he did a good job of avoiding this in his own work. The ""penalty"" of course, was that he couldn't lay claim to having the definitive answer to anything. But in doing this, he more than made up for what he lost: in all its admitted non-authoritativeness, Nietzsche's project ""cuts to the heart of matters"" in a way that few others do. He doesn't have ""the answers,"" but boy oh boy, does he know how to ask the right questions, and provide fruitful suggestions as to how they MIGHT be answered.   And I think this explains why Nietzsche has had such a great reception in all the ""Sexy"" projects in the 20th century. Psychoanalysis, objectivism, postmodernism, the Frankfurt school--say what you will about these movements, they had an energy and a vivacity that those 20th century projects without a Nietzschean touch couldn't match. And I think the explanation is just that  Nietzschean influence; like Nietzsche, they weren't afraid to ask the ""deep"" questions even if it meant sacrificing a certain ""rigor"" or ""certainty."""

This undoubtedly also applies to many other writers from many different countries, but I just wanted to add my two cents regarding Nietzsche.  Concerning his critique on religion, he is often misunderstood because most people only know the ""God is dead"" quote. To grasp a fraction of what he was trying to say, you should at least read the whole paragraph:   God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us?

philosophy,3b7vy6,Elided_Ego,7,Sat Jun 27 20:38:54 2015 UTC,"I once heard someone explain the flow of time as a sort of optical illusion. OK, we've got block time, right? The universe is a slab, which ""is"" (no becoming, just being). We are Donnie-Darko-style time-worms inside this block (if you view a human being in all 4-dimensions, we get stretched out along the time axis). But why do the worms perceive themselves to be moving forward rather than backward? The explanation is evolutionary. Creatures which develop a sense of time flow are better adapted to be worms in this chunk of block time, because they avoided things which would have ended their journey. Successful organisms are adapted to the asymmetry of entropy in block time in a way that makes a long tube worm of creature-offspring/creature-offspring/creature. A continuity of life which is a giant worm in a chunk of block time.   So, we as creatures, have a flicker-frame-rate for consciousness. For fun, let's say 24 frames per second. Anything smaller than that is an imperceptible unit of time (NOTE: the frame rate of consciousness does seem to be variable in some instances). Time does not flow and is arbitrarily divisible, but the subjective experience of the ""now"" is made up of processing moments where brains process(ed) information about what appear(ed)s to be ahead in time in relation to and based information about the past (memory, sense data) to have navigated the worm further along the axis. The evolutionary benefit of the illusion of time is the same as the evolutionary benefit of the illusion of agency, it provides creatures the ability to have extended their tube a longer distance. There is no purpose of design here. It's just that worms that were batter adapted to a block of space-time with increasing entropy in the time dimension made longer Swiss cheese like drifts in reality. Our consciousness is, simultaneously, all these moments (frames of perceptual reality) distributed along the time dimension. You are NOT moving forward in time, rather your particular moment of consciousness is forever frozen in a moment of reading this shit-post, trying to figure out what this Tisias person is saying and how to attack it. In this sense, we're forever joined. This is our moment. You have always been the caretaker, Jack."
philosophy,3b7vy6,Tisias,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:58:39 2015 UTC,"I think block time also explains the 'now' fairly elegantly.  Why does Jon feel like it's 'now' at 3pm?  Well his is physically located at that time slice with a brain that is set up with memories of the previous few seconds, few minutes etc..  It's the same reason he feels it is 'now' at 4 pm, and 5 pm.  I also think it answers the question of 'time flow' well: Do you feel like time was flowing for the last 10 seconds?  How about the last 5 seconds, or 10 milliseconds?  As you get smaller you see there is no need for a time dimension because it is an instant (from your conscious point of view).  Therefore you are just feeling instants, not periods.  That means it doesn't matter if the universe is static or not."
philosophy,3b7vy6,LegendLength,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:29:52 2015 UTC,"A confusing part is that we must conceive of time being frozen in amber, a spatial dimension with no flow, but with directionality (e.g,. entropy increasing in one direction, memory on one side only, biological evolution only moving in one direction). Why is time collapsed in one direction? Why don't we see worm tubes tunneling in the other direction? If there is no reason to privilege the alleged fixity of the past over the fluid openness of they future (i.e., all times are equally real) why do we still have the tyranny of the past over the future? Why did the past cause the future? Why didn't the future also cause the past?   The more immediate problem is why we sense/feel the flow of time. I don't think this is a physics question, but rather a qualia question. I think, therefore, that the time-flow question is subsumed into a larger question (i.e., the hard problem of consciousness). Einstein couldn't account for this, in my opinion, because science is not tooled for it. In short, I side with Chalmers. If this view is right, it's not that there is anything magical or queer about time, but rather qualia which includes flow-experience within it."

This is not even factually accurate.  No mention of the fact that Einstein was vehemently opposed to Bergson's philosophy.

A theory of order of occurrences wouldn't necessarily be a theory that does away with duration -- however we know from experiment that any theory of time based on order of occurrances alone cannot possibly describe nature, since experiments are highly consistent with Einstein's theories of relativity, which allow for relativity of simultaneity -- in other words, one observer may see an event A occurring before event B, while another observer may see event B occurring before A; and both observers are correct.  (Note:  One might argue that there is some ""preferred reference frame"" in which either event A or event B objectively occurs before, after, or at the same time as the other; however, the formulations of relativity are ""background independent"" and have no such preferred reference frame.  There is also no experimental evidence indicating that such a frame exists, while there have been experiments seeking such a frame such as the Michelson-Morley experiment which turned up negative, and itself prompted the development of relativity in order to explain the negative result.)"

philosophy,3b7vy6,LegendLength,1 point,Tue Jun 30 05:34:36 2015 UTC,"Relativity of Simultaneity is not a problem for block universe / eternalism.   Relativity implies eternalism, so naturally it is not a problem for eternalist theories in general.  Of course, eternalist theories do not necessarily feature an objective temporal ordering of events (which is what the previous poster was asking about and I was responding to).  Those specific eternalist theories which do feature an objective temporal ordering are not compatible with relativity, and thus can't describe our universe since they would be at odds with experimental evidence.  As for a growing block universe, relativity of simultaneity still remains as a problem, and it's fundamentally the same problem that exists for presentist philosophies:  a preferred frame is required to establish an objective ""present"" from which measurements in other subjective reference frames can be derived.  However, in relativity, there are always other reference frames which would have events in that frame's present that have not yet occurred in the preferred frame's present.  Put another way, this means no matter which frame you choose, someone somewhere is going to have determined present events which have not yet occurred in the preferred frame (which is at odds with the basic tenet of a growing block universe:  that the future of the preferred frame does not exist).  Unfortunately you can't get out of this via some mechanism by which all inertial reference frames (of which there are infinitely many) are equally preferred and are involved in determining when the future becomes the present, because then for all reference frames, at least some of their future is now pre-determined (again violating the basic tenet of a growing block universe:  that the future does not exist).  It is not, in general, considered that presentist philosophies (or presentist-like philosophies such as growing block universes) can be reconciled with relativity ... or for that matter, actuality anymore, since there is a wealth of experimental evidence that nature obeys laws consistent with that of relativity.   You could conceivably draw a 4 dimensional diagram of the whole universe and it would be coherent. Simultaneity only comes into the picture when you ask about the subjective measurements done by particular observers in that block.   The problem is that due to relativity, you can conceivably draw infinitely many 4-dimensional state diagrams of the present universe, and all of them must be necessarily equally coherent.  However, not all of them contain the same set of events in that present moment.  For some such diagrams, they would contain events that lie in the future in other diagrams.  Since all such diagrams must be equally valid, this necessitates that the future is at least partially determined ahead of time for any given reference frame.  Bottom line is, in order for future events to not already exist, there must be some mechanism by which those events become determined, so that they can exist in the present.  But when you assume relativity, no such mechanism is possible, even with an arbitrarily-chosen frame to be considered as ""preferred.""  Hope that helps."

philosophy,3b7vy6,ughaibu,3,Sat Jun 27 02:19:34 2015 UTC,"To understand Einsteins view of time you need to look at it as space. Think of a static world where moments are just a different place in another direction (a fourth dimension direction).   So basically you and every object has a shape not a motion stretching across this 4D space.   You can play this out making an imaginary 2D world on a piece of paper. If you put a circle object in there and imagine time being up and down through your 3rd exterior dimension. If the circle remains motionless in your world its true shape is a tall straight cylinder. If it moves about randomly it will resemble a worm or a spiral or any number of odd twists depending on how it moves.   It gets more complicated than this, one reason being both the fabric of these spaces (space-time) curves and twists from different properties. Mass, velocity (as you can see on your paper velocity is an increase in your cylinders/worms length ie:mass, which will be  compensated by curvature in the fabric) etc... but it gives you a general view to work with."
philosophy,3b7vy6,Dibblerius,6,Sat Jun 27 09:10:36 2015 UTC,"Eli27, summary?"
philosophy,3b7vy6,welldongsir,7,Sat Jun 27 02:57:23 2015 UTC,"The article doesn't really explain much about the disagreement. This is as I understand it (I'm not particularly familiar with Bergsonian time):  Einstein argues for relativity of space-time. What this means is that simultaneity depends on a particular point of reference. From location L, it seems to me that events E and F respectively happen in locations M and N simultaneously. But from a different location O, E and F may in fact appear to occur one after the other.  This disjunct between these two frames of reference (from A and from D) is reflective of an objective reality: there is no such thing as a ""universal now"". From L, events E and F are happening now. From O, E is happening now but F is not.  So Einstein's theory of special relativity challenges the notion of a 'now', and in particular, challenges the notion of a privileged frame of reference. So what I experience as 'now' is not a special experience.  By contrast Bergson appears to argue that (A) duration is the essence of the experience of time; and (B) that our experience of time (subjective) is reflective of objective time.   It's very important to distinguish between these two points. (A) does not conflict at all with Einstein's thesis. It can be both the case that the essence of our subjective experience of time is about duration, as a psychological thesis, whilst that duration has no place in a scientific picture.  But (B) is problematic. This point appears to be important for Bergson in order to combat Kant, who distinguishes between the phenomenal and the noumenal: for Kant, the phenomenal (what we experience) is distinct from the underlying essence (the noumenal) which can never be directly experienced.  In the case of time, Bergson wants to say that his psychological thesis of duration is (presumably) constituted by an objective notion of duration that exists in the world apart from the human subject.  For Einstein, the notion of duration just cannot be reconciled with special relativity. Time in physics is not about duration in his view, and thus he rejects (B).  Time in contemporary philosophy  Who is right? Philosophy of time today makes every effort to reconcile itself with Einstein's theory of special relativity. I think there is some merit to Bergson's view as a psychological thesis; in fact, whilst the article points out that Bergson is no longer really mentioned in ..., I think this disguises a more complex truth.  Bergsonian time was influential on several philosophers in the continent, including Proust and Heidegger. Importantly, the continental tradition of phenomenology, which is the core of continental thought during the 20th century, seeks to abandon the traditional opposition between subject and object.   The notions of subjectivity and objectivity are themselves constituted by human experience, and thus, the priority for continental philosophers is to understand that human experience. Phenomenologists don't really care much about scientific time; though it may be true in some sense, it doesn't have any sway over our personal experience of time, which is the question they're interested in.  The fact that the Stanford Encyclopaedia doesn't mention Bergson is thus not particularly surprising. The Stanford Encyclopaedia is firmly grounded in the analytic tradition (which dominated Anglophone countries). Analytic philosophy sees itself as a kind of science, using the tools of language and deductive reason to provide objective facts about the world. Analytic philosophy is thus extremely interested in physics."
philosophy,3b7vy6,cardinalallen,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:18:04 2015 UTC,I've read a bit of Robert Lanza's biocentrism and it feels to be a some kind of modern follow up for Bergson's concept of time. I'm not really able to judge its content but do you have an opinion about it?
philosophy,3b7vy6,poltsi,3,Sat Jun 27 21:53:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know a huge amount about Lanza's biocentrism, but that's because it's a pseudo-philosophy. Or rather, philosophy in the sense that Buddhism is philosophy.   Both analytic and continental philosophy are very rigorous. Analytic philosophers tend to have a bit of disdain for their continental counterparts, but that's simply because analytic rigour is easier to specify: the rules of deductive logic are firm rules like those of arithmetic. Analytic philosophers start of with 'common sense' statements about the world, and try to figure out the logical consequences of such statements.  Continental philosophers have an inherently vaguer task. Phenomenology (which covers a large part of continental philosophy) is about describing experiences accurately and as basically as possible. Rules of logic don't come into play as much here, so findings are less clear cut. But nonetheless, it is rigorous: phenomenologists aim to be as accurate as possible.  By contrast, the whole realm of pseudo-philosophy, such as Lanza's, begins with a set of contentious assumptions. Given these assumptions, the author tries to create a coherent worldview. In this sense, such philosophies are a sort of theology. Christianity creates a worldview from a set of basic assumptions; and indeed that worldview is remarkably coherent (i.e. lacking in internal contradictions).   Nonetheless, the coherency of the worldview, though important, remains entirely secondary to:  a) the plausibility of the initial assumptions; and  b) the quantity of initial assumptions.  Somebody like Lanza seems to have both lots of assumptions, and several which seem fundamentally implausible.  More generally, Bergson's theory of time seems a little rudimentary. I think he does have something to contribute, but only in terms of providing a psychological or phenomenological theory of time, rather than a claim about the objective world.   Presumably Lanza, if he uses Bergson, would be guilty of the latter; Lanza is presenting a theory about the world, rather than about human experience. This would be a mistake.  Edit:  Have briefly skimmed through some more of Lanza's claims, I would also add the following. Though I firmly believe that the world and being can only be understood in relation to humanity, I also strongly object to any attempt to combine such a thesis with the sciences.   The precise value of the the sciences lies in its methodology, and it's not at all helpful to mess with that. Nonetheless, we have gotten ourselves into a peculiar situation of claiming that the sciences are the fundamental grounds of human knowledge. Yes, in a sense they are by definition the ""most objective"", insofar as the try to cut out the human subject; but conversely, the world is itself first constituted as meaningful through a human experience. The notion of objectivity etc. only makes sense given humanity.  This is a common finding of continental philosophy. That doesn't lead such philosophers to try to change the sciences at all. Rather, they try to reorient the emphasis that society places on the sciences: they are a tool to understand the world, but the knowledge we get of the world through the sciences is only one of many different forms of knowledge we can have. It is privileged only because there is so much that can still be found out about the world through science."

Bergson thinks of time as duration and subjective, i.e. the experience of time passing inherent to the person rather than the universe (not subjective as in not factual), while Einstein thinks of time as something about the universe itself and being a sort of order of things like space and geometry.  Science beat philosophy after the 1920s for a number of reasons including science being seen as more masculine, but now that quantum theory says God plays dice with the universe, maybe Einstein was wrong after all and Bergson is worth re-reading.

philosophy,3b7vy6,Ligerian,1 point,Sat Jun 27 10:32:07 2015 UTC,"Well,  Bergson may have influenced a bit Einstein. Actually, Einstein finally thought time was a kind of an illusion.   At the death of his friend, he said to the mourning wife :  ""...for us physicists believe the separation between past, present, and future is only an illusion, although a convincing one.""  Why that ? Because modern physics, thermodynamics excluded, use time as a variable, not like something fundamental. There is no arrow of time. With Einstein, time went directly like a space coordinate.   The main (shocking) thing to remember is that almost all fundamental Physics treat time as reversible. Again, like a coordinate.   For non scientists, the ""Newton paradigm"" well described by Lee Smolin and taken also by Einstein, was to analyze events like a succession of ""fixed frames"" that you can explore forward or backward. It's like a movie. You can reverse a movie, you see.  This way of doing works when describing our environment with our mathematical tools, but is quite shocking in philosophical terms. Time simply disapeared from Physics as something ""special"" and ""odd"", to become like ""x"", ""y"" , ""z"" etc."

But barring that consider this occurrence:   A radioactive decaying rock which takes say 20years to decay into something not radioactive is on an unmanned space probe that travels near light-speed to a spot 10 light-years away and back to its origin planet or wherever it started.   States of similar rocks left there waiting will have had 20 years to decay before the probe returns and have lost its radioactive properties. The returning rock onboard the probe will still be radioactive because its speed slowed down time aboard the ship (time-dilation) and it did not have 20 years do do it.    This is all independent of a subjective observer. The objects would have different properties due to curvature in time. So how could then time be a subjective property? It clearly affects properties of things regardless of observation.  Does this make sense to you?"

But then if people are truly interested in thinking about these things, as with all theories when they're not currently understood or appreciated, best not to ignore it, but simply put it to one side if it can't be understood at present.

Unless we define what we mean by the term universe or consciousness these differences arise, over semantics.   Consciousness can be thought of as a field which is all there is, so not a particularly human trait arising within an individual's brain. All possible universes arise as fluctuations within that field. So could conscioesness affect the universe? In a sense, like could the ocean affect a wave? We could imagine them as separate entities, but from a deeper perspective, they're not. like the point you've made, waves are not separate from and affected by the ocean, they're part it, of it's nature , and are more like a concept, a way of caregorising one feature of the ocean.  As with this theory of consciousness being primary, it doesn affect the universe, it's what the universe is."
philosophy,3b7vy6,smallwoodthings,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:03:44 2015 UTC,Yeah I get it but I don't see what particular account of subjectivity thisd is actually at odds with. From a subjective point of view less than 20 years will have passed for the traveling rock and 20 will have passed for the remaining ones. This doesn't necessarily contradict what Einstein said as far as I can see.
philosophy,3b7vy6,Zoroch,2,Sat Jun 27 11:16:43 2015 UTC,"It doesn't contradict what Einstein said. It IS what he said.  But my point is it is not subjective in the sense that the travelling rock is in a different state on return than the ones left.   It is real that the one has been changed by how time slowed. It is spewing out its radioactivity on to its surrounding next to the rocks that didn't make the trip where as if was it just a subjective experience of that one rock nothing should have changed when it had returned.   It is not a subjective point of view of the rock. Time actually does slow down due to its velocity and the effects of that remains true when rejoined by other objects (subjects if you insist but rocks are to our best knowledge not observing anything).   Another example is gravity. Every GPS satellite need to recalibrate its clock to compensate its faster speed due to less gravity than on earths surface. Otherwise they are off target.   The tiny miss-match of time rate here and up there would actually put the GPS system off target. Even if nobody is there to watch it subjectively. It's a real effect with real physical consequences.    I don't know maybe I'm not really understanding what you are saying or maybe I am not the right person to answer this but I wanted to try.   Basically my point is if time changes rate, actually, and the physical effects of that remains and affect objects where time didn't change rate I can't see how time could be subjective or in some sense not real.   I thought that was the base of the conflict but I might be mistaken."

Ah, but relativity absolutely does aid in explaining the nature of time!  It predicts and explains the geometric origin of various temporal phenomena, including both kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and the relativity of simultaneity.  It directly links our perception and measurement of time to reference frames, and provides calculable relationships between different classes of reference frames, allowing two observers with different perceptions of time to come to an agreement on what is physically happening even though the quantities they actually measure are indeed different -- this is the essence of relativity, really.  And we can actually do experiments which get different measurements, and then calculate how those different measurements do actually describe the same physical situation, enabling us to confirm that we are in fact not crazy and are seeing the same physical reality, just from two different perspectives.   (It is late, though, and I've had a series of poor discussions lately, so I'm sorry if my scepticism is leading me to ignore anything I shouldn't be. ...   No worries!  It was like 2 AM haha.

I think you'd find that in relativity, the same connections to space generalize pretty readily to time as well, and perhaps you would feel more comfortable with that if you had a more intimate understanding of relativity.  Might I suggest a really great book on the topic written by Einstein himself?  See if you can get your hands on a copy of Relativity: The Special and the General Theory.  This book is actually aimed at laymen -- people who have a high school physics education and are somewhat familiar with Newtonian mechanics but are much less familiar with anything beyond that.  The book is fairly short and does not actually contain very much math.  It also has a lot of diagrams to help with explaining the thought experiments in the book.  Sometimes the way Einstein words things is a little obtuse (and the fact that it's translated from German doesn't help), but he really does his best to explain the ideas behind relativity from the simplest possible terms, and to connect the ideas logically.  I found that book to be extremely helpful in understanding relativity myself -- you might be surprised, actually, at how easy special relativity is to grasp.  General relativity is a lot more complicated unfortunately and the book only starts to touch on GR, but it's at least an excellent introduction to the concepts."

Now I'm curious about how that inference can be made.  I may have to read something.   If I may suggest something to you, consider reading about Zeno's paradoxes.  Zeno was a philosopher who argued that because continuous quantities are infinitely divisible (you can keep dividing a second -- or a metre -- into smaller and smaller fractions, with no ""smallest fraction""), that traversal of a continuous quantity is not physically possible, since an infinite number of steps are required in order to achieve a finite, nonzero change.  Zeno's paradox is ultimately resolved through the development of modern calculus, whereby the sum of many infinite series can be determined to be an exactly finite value, and in a finite number of steps.  I have to laugh at something historical that the Wikipedia article mentions:   According to Simplicius, Diogenes the Cynic said nothing upon hearing Zeno's arguments, but stood up and walked, in order to demonstrate the falsity of Zeno's conclusions.   Of course, as the article continues:   To fully solve any of the paradoxes, however, one needs to show what is wrong with the argument, not just the conclusions.   Which is absolutely true.  I happen to like the arguments put forth by Artistotle and St. Thomas Aquinas:   Thomas Aquinas, commenting on Aristotle's objection, wrote ""Instants are not parts of time, for time is not made up of instants any more than a magnitude is made of points, as we have already proved. Hence it does not follow that a thing is not in motion in a given time, just because it is not in motion in any instant of that time.""   Hope that is interesting!"

philosophy,3b7vy6,nonsequitur_potato,5,Sat Jun 27 04:29:26 2015 UTC,"But there is believed to be a minimum meaningful distance, the Planck length.   FYI, this is not actually correct!  The Planck length is the scale at which quantum corrections to general relativity become first-order (meaning the corrections are as large or larger than the original calculation), making the prediction of that theory unreliable. [1]  While it may be the case that the Planck length could be the smallest measurable length (though this isn't established either), that does not mean it is the smallest meaningful length.  It is entirely possible for smaller lengths to exist and to affect the results of experiments (for example, in probabilistic ways), while keeping our ability to accurately measure those lengths limited by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.   There's no similar concept that I'm aware of for time though, and it's an interesting question.   The corresponding natural unit for time would be the Planck time.  Though as the Wiki suggests, like the Planck length, there isn't necessarily any physical significance to that unit.   Is time truly continuous or is it, as space seems to be, simply discretized to a level far below what we're able to perceive?   This is an excellent and unresolved question!  In the interests of giving you something to think about, I would like to point out that all of our best, most accurate models of physics model both space and time as truly mathematically continuous, and not discrete.  In particular, these models include both special and general relativity as well as quantum mechanics, both in its relativistic and non-relativistic formulations!  (QM being formulated in a continuous spacetime comes as a surprise to many people, no doubt because of the confusion surrounding Planck units.)  There are models of physics which have genuine minimum length and/or time scales, such as loop quantum gravity and doubly special relativity -- however, these models all seem to have some problems that continuous models do not, and it is not clear whether a discrete model of nature is viable.  Hope that helps!"
philosophy,3b7vy6,hikaruzero,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:06:12 2015 UTC,"From the Wikipedia article for Planck length: ""In some forms of quantum gravity, the Planck length is the length scale at which the structure of spacetime becomes dominated by quantum effects, and it is impossible to determine the difference between two locations less than one Planck length apart."" Obviously we're getting speculative here and it depends which model you believe, but if a difference between two locations can't be determined if they're separated by less than a Planck length, doesn't that imply that sub-Planck length distances are not physically meaningful? For example, if a particle moves 1/2 planck length, we would say it has not moved by any possible measurement. According to the theory, this is not an imprecision of measurement, but a property of space/distance.  I probably should have done a quick search for Planck time, that couldn't have been hard to find. Definitely an interesting question though, especially since discretized space/time is so much at odds with the way we perceive reality. Then again, not nearly so much as all of quantum mechanics. But on the other hand, people thought matter and liquid were continuous until very recently, and it's difficult for me to conceptualize truly continuous spacetime as well. But maybe that's just a result of me being so used to everything being quantified in units. EDIT: and I've just understood what you meant by affecting things in probabilistic ways. I don't do my best thinking when I'm browsing reddit because I can't sleep. Still, with the uncertainty principle, these effects would be related to the wave function collapse, correct? If so, it doesn't really have physical significance in the way we're used to thinking of it (i.e. Non-QM), does it?"
philosophy,3b7vy6,nonsequitur_potato,3,Sat Jun 27 07:44:16 2015 UTC,"Sorry for the long post!  You ask some good questions! :)   Obviously we're getting speculative here and it depends which model you believe, but if a difference between two locations can't be determined if they're separated by less than a Planck length, doesn't that imply that sub-Planck length distances are not physically meaningful?   Nope!  It means they are not physically measurable but that doesn't mean they don't exist or that they aren't meaningful.  For example, it may still be the case that although we can't determine the difference, we could in principle construct a deterministic experiment where a particle is confined to such a small region (say, a Planck volume), and we might get back different results each time we interact with the particle, even though we might not be able to determine why the results are different (since we can't measure the difference).  I'm not implying that this is the case, and obviously the scale for this is enormously small and it is unlikely we'll ever be able to create the technology needed to operate on this scale.  However, physical meaninglessness is not a logical implication of physical immeasurability.  Hope that helps clarify!   According to the theory, this is not an imprecision of measurement, but a property of space/distance.   Actually, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle applies to quantum systems, not to space itself.  It could be the case that such lengths are physically meaningless.  But it also could not be the case.  We may find that a quantum theory of gravity (needed to accurately describe physics on these small scales) might provide an explanation for the origin of uncertainty.  Right now, uncertainty is an ontological feature of quantum mechanics (i.e. it's ""baked in"" as a feature of systems, and is not just an epistemological limit to what we can measure), but an appropriate theory of quantum gravity may provide some conditions by which that ontological feature could be removed or otherwise altered in some types of systems.  FWIW I think this is would be an unlikely outcome, but I don't believe we can exclude it as a logical possibility at the current time.   Still, with the uncertainty principle, these effects would be related to the wave function collapse, correct?   Surprisingly, no!  Even theories where there is no objective wavefunction collapse exhibit uncertainty.  Uncertainty is a result of the operators for pairs of physical observables (such as position and momentum) being non-commutative -- that is to say, it has a non-zero commutator.  Any such pair of non-commuting observables necessarily has an uncertainty relation between them.  This is somewhat closely tied to the complicated notion of counterfactual definiteness, which is basically a fancy way of saying ""observable values stay well-defined even when we're not measuring them.""  One powerful result of Bell's theorem suggests that the universe must either violate relativity and locality, or it must be counterfactually indefinite (meaning some physically observable properties become ill-defined when other properties that they do not commute with become well-defined).  It's not yet clear which of those conditions is true, and different interpretations of quantum mechanics make different assumptions about whether one or the other (or both) are true.   If so, it doesn't really have physical significance in the way we're used to thinking of it (i.e. Non-QM), does it?   I honestly don't know of any classical theories which feature non-commuting observables, so uncertainty would not be a feature of classical theories, so I would think that in a classical theory it would be less likely for the Planck length to be physically significant (with regards to whether we can tell two points apart).

Did you know that there are actually two classes of mathematical models which are not subject to the incompleteness theorems?  The incompleteness theorems have two important prerequisites:  (1) that the model be capable of expressing certain truths about the set of natural numbers, and (2) that the model have a countable number of axioms.  There are models which do not satisfy the first requirement -- that is to say, they are not expressive enough to either define the natural numbers (for example, finitary set theory, which disallows definition of infinite sets), or isn't able to make the necessary statements about the natural numbers, for example because they cannot define addition or multiplication of natural numbers.  These models might be considered ""trivial"" because they aren't capable of describing nature.  There are also models which do not satisfy the second requirement -- they have an uncountably infinite number of axioms, rather than a finite or countably infinite number.  You might wonder how or whether such a model could be reasonable ... but in fact there are interesting and important models which do satisfy the property.  For example, consider a model where every statement about the natural numbers that is true is taken as an axiom.  The set of true statements about the natural numbers can be shown to be uncountably infinite.  This model is somewhat well-studied and has a name:  ""true arithmetic.""

philosophy,3b7vy6,KilgoreAlaTrout,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:26:18 2015 UTC,"Okay, I understand the angle you're getting at now.  Allow me to give you an alternative answer which I think will be a bit more satisfying.  The concepts behind ""what links one moment to another"" and ""what links one point in space to another"" would be, simply put, the notion of ""adjacency.""  Adjacency isn't specific to continuous structures -- discrete structures can also have points which are considered adjacent to eachother -- but for continuous structures specifically, adjacent points are points which are ""connected"" -- that the two points do not belong to the union of two disjoint open sets.  Simple connectedness essentially is the condition that there is no boundary between the given points.  Interestingly, the last thing you mentioned in your post, about there being ""possible paths"" between two points, is actually a wholely separate concept of connectedness that isn't quite what I'm talking about.  That concept is also called ""path connectedness"" and is a stronger constraint than simple connectedness.  We're getting a little out of my depth here but a related topic is measure theory and the notion of Lebesgue measure, which are used to define notions of ""distance"" (including duration, which is essentally ""temporal distance"") and ""size"" on arbitrary spaces.  Hope that helps!"

Hehe ... are you so sure it's just a ""philosophical"" perspective?  I'd say it is a scientific one as well ... in theories of relativity where space and time have a unified description, movement through time is indeed treated quite the same as movement through space. :)   In a physical sense given our relative motion to the center of our galaxy and our rotational motion relative to the Earths center, we currently have no way physical to get back to an earlier position in space if by space we mean the universe and if space time keeps expanding at the rate we think it is, that will only get harder and harder to do   One small caveat -- if the expansion of space keeps accelerating at the rate it is now, it's actually not the case that this would be harder and harder to do.  Bound systems (even large gravitationally bound systems such as a galaxy) stay bound and do not expand in size.  Essentially the binding forces overcome the expansion and keep the system at a fixed size.  This isn't really relevant to your point or mine, just thought you might find it neat to know. :)   but we think we can and can do so in a sense if we limit our view to the frame of the Earth... but then we run into other problems because we pecieve of positions relative to other objects more so than in a coordinate sense.

I have to admit I am not sure I followed you entirely, so I'm going to try approaching certan parts of what you said and maybe you can elaborate from there?  Firstly, the models that we build, while yes they are just models and they have limitations, we know and study what those limitations are, and the results they give us are generally not so puzzling (but are in fact quite logical, even in quantum mechanics) and allow us to make surprisingly accurate predictions about the future behavior of physical systems.  If the model is successful at describing nature, we do have to honestly entertain the idea that the structure of nature is identical to (or at least isomorphic to) the structure of the model.  At least, we must do this for aspects of nature which do not fall outside the limits of the model.  A second thing is that the whole ""infinite sum of the positive integers being -1/12,"" that's all garbage.  The sum 1+2+3+4... is formally divergent, it does in fact grow without bound (the limit is infinite), and the sum is not equal to -1/12.  This claim got popularized in one of Numberphile's videos, but Numberphile is unfortunately mistaken.  That infinite series does have a relationship to the quantity -1/12, however that relationship is not the sum of the series, it is just a finite quantity that you can, in certain limited contexts, replace the infinite series with, and get a sensible answer.  Here's a little more reading for you about this claim.  Again I am not sure I grasped the essence of your point, so I apologize in advance if none of this is relevant ... :("
philosophy,3b7vy6,hikaruzero,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:31:41 2015 UTC,"thanks for the links on the sum =-1/12 thing... but if in certain contexts you can replace the sum with -1/12 (then for that context the two are equivalent) but for other contexts we can not, what it does indicate is (and which was my point) that we really don't undestand things that are outside the context of a finite and macro world. Like one math prof I had used to say, if you think you can truly visualize four spatial dimensions, then you are certifiably crazy...  As to models.. if they provide accurate predicaitons and results, we can indeed entertain that they model the structure... but the key word is ""entertain"", especially if the model has ""magic"" numbers or ""constants"" which are tweaked and calculated to make the model's predictions accurate... the effect is bascially the same as a tailor fitting a suit... the suit is a model of the body, can be very accurate and comfortable but it is still a suit and not the body."
philosophy,3b7vy6,KilgoreAlaTrout,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:31:10 2015 UTC,"if in certain contexts you can replace the sum with -1/12 (then for that context the two are equivalent) but for other contexts we can not, what it does indicate is (and which was my point) that we really don't undestand things that are outside the context of a finite and macro world.   No, I think you misunderstand ... we know full well in which contexts we can make that replacment, and why, and in which contexts we cannot make that replacement, and why not.  We already clearly do understand a great many things outside the context of a finite and macroscopic world.  Regarding finiteness, that is why we developed tools such as calculus, modern ZF set theory, category theory, higher-order logic, and in particular, our advanced understanding of cardinal numbers -- which categorize the sizes of sets, including different sizes of infinity -- and ordinal numbers, which are closely related to cardinal numbers.  These areas of mathematics are all highly developed and well-understood, and we have rigorous methods for dealing with transfinite numbers and transfinite arithmetic.  I think you'd be surprised just how solid our understanding of infinite quantities is; there are whole branches of mathematics devoted to it that go way, way beyond even the above few topics.  As for things outside the macroscopic world, again, we have extremely precise theories both for the microscopic world, and for the largest scales of the world we can observe (let's just call this the cosmos as a whole).  One of the most accurate, precise, and well-tested theories in science at the moment is quantum electrodynamics, and another particularly notable theory is quantum chromodynamics, which describes the interactions between quarks and particles composed of quarks (hadrons).  We now have good theories to describe atomic and molecular orbitals, unique phases of matter such as superconductivity and superfluidity, degenerate matter (as found in neutron stars), and other things which are way beyond our realm of experience as humans.  It is because of all these things that we are able to develop computers that are so enormously fast.  Likewise with the largest structures in the universe, we have an accurate understanding of the big bang and the early universe, all the way down to the electroweak epoch, which was only the tiniest, tiniest fraction of a second after the big bang (we're talking about 10-32 of one second).  So I just can't agree that we don't understand things outside the context of our typical everyday experience.  We have such a good understanding of those things, that we are able to leverage them to dramatically enhance our lives.   Like one math prof I had used to say, if you think you can truly visualize four spatial dimensions, then you are certifiably crazy...   Hehe ... and your professor is right, but only because we are 3-dimensional creatures that evolved structures (eyes, ears, etc.) for perceiving a 3-dimensional world.  To compensate for our limited visualization and perceptual abilities, we've developed acute mathematics which generalizes to any number of dimensions, and we've made it possible (even easy, some would argue) to do calculations that tell us how things would be different in higher-dimensional worlds.  This has even led to some profound and surprising discoveries -- for example, in Kaluza-Klein theory, general relativity formulated in 5 dimensions (4 space + 1 time) turns out to have equations that reduce to the same equations of general relativity in 4 dimensions (3+1) plus Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism, as well as one additional component (equations for a scalar field -- and surprise, surprise, with the discovery of the Higgs boson, we now know there is at least one scalar field that exists in nature; interesting coincidence, isn't it?).  So in conclusion, just because we can't visualize it, doesn't mean we don't understand it.  Another good counterexample to that idea would be our understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum; our eyes can only see a tiny sliver of the full spectrum, but we now have tools allowing us to measure and ""see"" the whole spectrum -- because of our excellent understanding of electromagnetism.   As to models.. if they provide accurate predicaitons and results, we can indeed entertain that they model the structure... but the key word is ""entertain"", especially if the model has ""magic"" numbers or ""constants"" which are tweaked and calculated to make the model's predictions accurate... the effect is bascially the same as a tailor fitting a suit... the suit is a model of the body, can be very accurate and comfortable but it is still a suit and not the body.   Your point isn't wrong or anything.  But I feel like it writes off any successful theory that doesn't happen to be a complete, perfect, 100% accurate theory of absolutely everything there ever was or ever could be.  Yes, models may at times be slightly wrong, or may not apply outside certain conditions.  But the models we've developed are highly applicable to our world of human experience (and far beyond it), and the degrees to which they are inaccurate can be quantified and tested.  Nobody is claiming the models are 100% accurate and complete -- in fact, we know the models will never be that -- but we can still say with certainty that the models are extremely accurate and only fail to apply under the most extremal conditions (things like inside black holes, the brief moments immediately following the big bang, etc.).  For all practical purposes, there is virtually no difference between 100% accuracy and 99.99994% accuracy.  ""If the suit fits, wear it,"" you know?  :P"
philosophy,3b7vy6,hikaruzero,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:17:41 2015 UTC,"the whole point is that 99.999994% accuracy is still just a drop in the infinitesimal bucket...  I think we are comfortable with that level of accuracy because at the sufficiently macro level or sense, determinism works, on the small number sub-atomic level it doesn't ... for example in spontaneous emission we can't predict even when that single photon will be emitted on the transition to a lower energy state, nor in what direction it will be emitted, we can only do so for that effect when the numbers increase to the point that we can do effective statistics... our capability to predict it seems is an emergent property.   Yes we have lots of neat formulas and techniques that deal with infinite elements, and we have nice classifications of different types of infinities and they are indeed very powerful tools. And you are right they do give us some understanding of infinity, I'm just not convinced that we aren't however just like the blind men touching an elephant, each reporting on ""local"" aspects of infinity and then even after they all report we collate their findings and say we understand what it is... but maybe that is because I don't... :)"
