The town has been slowly dying for the past 20 years or so, and then when we finally DO get businesses moving in a large pile of locals started bitching about it.  Two examples:   At the head of the only lighted intersection in the village, an auto parts store and a pizza joint burned to the ground. Both businesses are still running and were moved to different locations. This left an unsightly concrete slab sitting in the middle of the village. The owner of the site simply wanted what the land was valued at. Subway moved in and installed a store there.  ""OH NO!!!"" some townspeople yelled. ""A chain store is moving into our precious little village! Can't we build a park there instead?""  Dollar General is moving into a location that was once seasonal cottages owned by a convenience store. Problem: The location is right near a town landmark. ""Oh noes! The store will block our view of Jockey cap! Also, CHAIN!""  The sight line has actually improved looking from the road. Some trees have been removed and you can see more of the rock. Plus a 16' building is no match  for a 175' boulder.  As of the whole ""Chain"" thing? Huh, let's see.... Mobil, Texaco, C.N. Brown/Big Apple, Irving, Rexall drugs, Citgo, NAPA, Carquest, (Give me a few, I can probably think of more) are all examples of chains that either came to or have left the town over the years.

On the one hand, screaming at a child that age who isn't yours is unacceptable. Babies cry. It's not a new thing. If you work with the public, that's just something you have to deal with. Crazy Lady could've just calmly asked them to leave.  On the other hand, of course it would've been polite for one of the parents to simply take the child outside. To let your kid be disruptive and then go online to complain when someone gets upset? That's low.   In the balance, and having not been there, I think both parties were in the wrong. However, Crazy Lady committed bigger offense by losing control of her temper and taking it out on a kid who was just doing what kids do."

The owners story sounds like bullshit. She says she has a small diner and a small grill yet she says there are 75 people. If it's a 40 min wait for 3 pancakes which she said in the article, I don't think you'd have 75 people in your diner unless they are fine with waiting 4 hours for a grilled cheese. The parents said it was around 10 minutes, not an hour, which seems more likely for 75 people in a diner for a 3 pancake wait and just maybe they wanted 3 fullsized pancakes to take the extra back home or for the trip. If you're supposed to work in a line of work where 99% of places say the customer is always right, you shouldn't flip shit like that, she could of politely asked the family ""I know your eating but your child is being very disruptive to our other patrons.""

She may have been technically correct but that went out the window when she decided she'd slam her fists down and yell at the kid. Any plausible doubt disappeared when she went on TV and doubled down on being a complete fucking moron.   I'm a parent. You don't need to be one to know that not everyone finds your kid to be the most charming person in the world. Shit,  my kid has even melted down at Marcy's Diner. We left quickly and the staff were great about boxes and rushing the check. But if in the middle of that the owner would have come out, slammed her fist on the table and yelled at my kid, I assure you I'd no longer be considering the technical correctness of the owners view. For that these parents are right to be pissed off, even if their kid ""started"" it. And their comment to their kid about raising her to not be like that is spot on."
Maine,3dyk91,IntravenusDeMilo,4,Tue Jul 21 23:37:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're the one missing the point.  You openly stated that your kid has melted down in that diner before and the staff was great when you packed up and left because of it.  These idiot parents didn't pack up and leave.  They just sat there and didn't attempt to control the situation at all.  It's not like the lady has a short fuse and snapped on the kid at the first whimper.  According to the parents it had been 10 minutes.  According to the owner it went on for 45 minutes, through ordering, food delivery and check delivery.  Even if it was only 10 minutes, that's about 8 and a half minutes too long before someone should have stood up and taken the kid for a walk outside to calm down.  The owner was right to snap, especially after she asked them to leave and they ignored her."
Maine,3dyk91,93_Vector,-4,Tue Jul 21 23:28:11 2015 UTC,"No, I don't think I am.  You're basically saying that because the parents were wrong, the diner owner must be right?  And that the owner was right to snap on a little kid?  It doesn't matter that it's the parents that were wrong, this lady basically melted down as well and yelled at a little kid.  Even then, OK, stress happens.  What does she do next?  She goes on TV and makes an even bigger ass of herself.  At that point, she became ""more"" wrong than the parents.  I mean, she had time to deliberate on this and chose her words.  It reflects poorly on Mainers, and in about 5 minutes, it's about to get a national spot on one of the network morning shows.  Awesome for us.  I'm not at all saying the parents were in the right.  I don't defend lazy parents just because they're parents and I am too.  They were wrong, but this lady went way over the top.  The parents' actions made them look bad.  The owner's actions were much more public than that."
Maine,3dyk91,IntravenusDeMilo,3,Tue Jul 21 01:38:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I forgot, when a parent fails at controlling their kid it's never ok for someone else to do it for them.  That's why babysitters, aunts, uncles, grandparents, teachers and daycare workers never yell at kids to behave.  Her TV interviews are a completely different issue, in that they're not an issue at all.  There are at least 500,000 people in Maine who would make the state look like a bunch of inbreds if we put a camera in front of them."

I don't care how long she had been crying or how badly you think the parents handled the situation. Yell at the parents if you must, but it takes a special kind of dipshit to bully a 2 year old.  As parents, we try our best to get kids to behave. Usually they do, sometimes they don't. I can tell you from my experience that my crying toddler bothers me a LOT more than it bothers you. My first impulse would be to leave, but often it's not that easy -- especially when you are travelling and simply need to eat. My guess is that the ""40 minutes"" of crying is a severe exaggeration. And it's not uncommon to put the kids food out of reach so they don't throw it at other patrons. Sounds like good parenting to me.  Furthermore, kids are an integral part of our society and deserve to be in restaurants, public parks, libraries, etc. Inevitably, they cry and often for no good reason. If you don't like crying kids, maybe you should be the one to stay at home."
Maine,3dvjgy,Kirby420_,-2,Mon Jul 20 11:01:30 2015 UTC,"I can tell you from my experience that my crying toddler bothers me a LOT more than it bothers you.   No, no it doesn't.   It embarrasses you because you know it's bothering everyone else.   My first impulse would be to leave, but often it's not that easy -- especially when you are travelling and simply need to eat.   So have some common courtesy and ask the waitress(er) to get your food to go instead, and eat in your car."
Maine,3dvjgy,brewski,0,Tue Jul 21 20:48:32 2015 UTC,"Yes, I have walked out plenty of times and I don't disagree with you. Sometimes parents can take turns going outside or (if alone) you can just leave. But you can't leave without paying for your food. You might be travelling with a child, who needs food for survival just like everyone else. Good luck eating with a 2 year old out on the sidewalk when it is raining. Every parent gets stuck in a public place with a crying baby or toddler. It just happens and it is part of life. I wouldn't say I was ever ""embarrassed"". Maybe frustrated. Apologetic.   The parents absolutely should have made every effort to do something about this situation. But that still doesn't give someone the right to bully a toddler."
Maine,3dvjgy,puzzleddaily,2,Wed Jul 22 01:27:24 2015 UTC,"All of your what ifs weren't what. It wasn't raining. It didn't all happen so fast that they would be concerned aboht paying the bill. They refused to leave, and Darla shut them down. That deserves a standing ovation."
Maine,3dvjgy,puzzleddaily,-4,Mon Jul 20 00:04:30 2015 UTC,Oh shut up. I'd bitch out all your kids if you did this to me. Take your food to go like a good little shithead. Do something.

I think there are several factors that have contributed to the ridiculous situation we see here:  -- tourists trying to experience fabricated local culture, i.e. food that comes off a Sysco truck and a ""local"" who wears a Chief Wahoo hat. -- The ""mother activist"" culture that has sprung up on facebook where 20 something girls think they're the world's most persecuted group -- an owner who has no concept of tact or the ""customer comes first"" mentality.

The notion that you can ""control"" a two year old is ridiculous. You ""manage"" a child of that age, but they are just starting to walk and talk. And, sometimes, cry."

Maine,3dvjgy,brewski,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:53:13 2015 UTC,"Good question. I offer no excuses for the parents in the referenced story. Seems like they could have done something. Personally I have run into a few unfortunate situations, especially alone.    You have ordered but the food has not arrived.  You haven't paid your bill. It is pouring rain or snowy outside. Your other child is in the bathroom. It's the only place open or you are on the road and simply need to eat (please don't downgrade this one. Just because you have a crying baby doesn't mean you aren't human and need to eat. Sometimes you just have to bite the bullet and get it done.)   The best option is to work on getting your child to stop crying. Difficult with a 2yo, but often possible. I think only once did one of my kids cry for 40 minutes (likely an exaggeration on the owner) and thankfully it happened at home. If this was really the case, there was probably something more going on than just a hungry kid. Maybe she was physically sick or has a disorder.  Edit: List formatting"

In the last month, a couple different people--people who know virtually nothing about Maine, can't stress that enough--have started wondering what's in the water up there.

Maine,3dug0e,kebake,16,Sun Jul 19 17:35:04 2015 UTC,"I get your point, but just to be clear to those reading, Portland and Boston have completely different cultures.   Mainers are a little too friendly, relaxed, and pretty obsessed with enjoying life. People from Massachusetts (and to a less sense New Hampshire) are not. The Tall Ships festival is bringing in tons of out-of-staters this weekend, and you can spot the non-Mainers immediately.  Calling Portland a suburb of Boston is like calling San Diego a suburb of Los Angeles. A couple weirdoes may make the two hour commute, but they are very different cities."
Maine,3dug0e,AT_thruhiker,11,Sun Jul 19 19:32:14 2015 UTC,"Parts of Portland are similar in feel to parts of Boston, but it's almost silly to compare since the within-city variability of Boston is greater than the inter-city variability between Boston and Portland on the whole.  Most people's perceptions of folks from Mass. is Boston, which is fine, but like Portland, it's a silly metric for the state as a whole. Western Mass. is more similar to Maine than it is to Boston both in culture and look.  Ask a central or western MA. resident about how they fair in Boston traffic and you'll realize that it's more about the rural/urban split than anything else.   You can spot the non-Mainers because it's easy to spot tourists in just about any area.  They are the folks with expendable cash, on vacation, and the ones that look confused and excited about things which are commonplace to yourself.  Portland is great.  It's a little tiring when far flung folks consider it to be ""not the real Maine"" especially when it's thriving."
Maine,3dug0e,KazamaSmokers,2,Sun Jul 19 20:25:19 2015 UTC,"and you'll realize that it's more about the rural/urban split than anything else.    Central Mass isn't that rural, though. It's Worcester, the Westboro-Framingham-Natick area and a bunch of mill towns."

With two more years to go, it's hard to imagine what we have in store from the playground bully in Augusta. Time will tell.

That could easily be $3000 to do it right. This one already had that done."
Maine,3dp1na,mainlydank,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:07:07 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of Subarus sold for well under 4-5k that have their maintenance kept up.  Any bought from a dealership should have recommended maintenance performed before sale, or sold for under book value.  I do agree its worth paying more for piece of mind, however I try not to pay more than book value, and if I do pay book value, I want everything perfect.  Last time I was at Norms, 90% of their cars were bought at Auction, meaning they paid very little for them.  Where did they acquire your car?"
Maine,3dp1na,injulen,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:17:31 2015 UTC,"Auto auction in NJ. I know full well I overpaid but I didn't ha e time to dick around or shop around and to me it was a great deal. Did you see those pics? The rusty one is an 04 and ""properly maintained"". It's really hard to find one in the shape I got and that's why I jumped on it. And so what that they paid a lot less for it, they're a dealer and in a position to so so. I don't complain that the 99c stuff at Walmart o my cost them 0.10 a piece because I know I can't get stuff wholesale just like I can't get into auto auctions. Plus they did a whole slew of work to it after buying it for cheap which is again well worth it."

Maine,3dnn2w,benjamonster,2,Fri Jul 17 22:53:05 2015 UTC,Other than the beer festival and some smaller radio promotion type shows I don't know that they have held this size concert there yet. I may be wrong but I do know that Passion Pit will be playing on Wednesday so that might give you an idea what to expect..  It looks like they have a healthy patch of grass growing for a lawn. My guess is the stage will be near that grassy area (closest to 295) with the pavilion as the behind area. All speculation though.   A good guess would be that all beer and food will be coming out of food type trucks and that there will be a line of portopotties in the back.
Maine,3dnn2w,jonar33,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:21:29 2015 UTC,"When driving north on 295 you can get a few decent glimpses of the grounds.  There is a giant 3-sided rectangle of porta-potties on the far side of the point and back ~50yds from the tip of the point. I imagine the stage would be built facing north, with its backstage being directly on the tip of the point, such that the audience sees the stage with the sopo/water view as the backdrop."

I understand you need to have rules in place, especially on Katahdin but these guys get off on enforcing every stupid rule throughout the park like they're fighting ISIS. A group of us used to go to the park once a year but after the constant harassment from the rangers we had just had enough and haven't been back in a few years.  In the campgrounds, if you make a peep after 8pm, you get a flashlight in your face demanding you keep quiet. It felt like no matter where we went we were being tailed by these people waiting for us to break some rule so they could write us up. And it's not like we were a rowdy group either, we were just there to relax and enjoy some away time. But the rangers made it feel like a prison most of the time.  It seems like a lot of state parks are like that now and it's a shame. I don't fault them for wanting to keep the places from becoming party destinations, but treating law-abiding guests like that is not the way to grow your park."

""I was on the summit when Scott Jurek arrived on Sunday, so my perspective may be a bit different than others. I had my trip planned for months in advance, and although I am a fan of Jurek and followed his trek, it was only by pure accident that we were there the same day. I've lived in Maine all my life, and this was my first hike all the way to the summit of Katahdin - and it was amazing. The pristine beauty is impossible to describe. When we reached the top there were 25 or so people who had also summited that day, and many were waiting for Scott Jurek's final ascent, and we decided to wait too. While there, we watched a couple take wedding photos in full wedding gown and dress blues. We spoke with a gentleman who was carrying a fallen soldier's stone for The Summit Project. We had lovely conversations about running, hiking and the amount of endurance and internal fortitude that it would take to complete an AT trek in 46 days. It was calm, peaceful and great to connect with people from all over the world. It wasn't rowdy, loud or disrespectful. There was a lot of excitement when Jurek made it to the summit, and I would expect there to be. It didn't take away from the beauty of Katahdin, and even Jurek commented on how stunning the area was. The champagne was a celebration of a long test of endurance, and he deserved every sip. Just like MANY hikers deserve their celebratory beers when they reach the summit. Yes, it 's against the rules, and maybe Jurek deserves the citation...but it happens all the time. It was not a party like BSP is describing it. He opened a bottle and then sat down to answer questions. I'm also surprised he was cited for having more than 12 people in his party. I watched them arrive, and I didn't think there were even that many - but regardless, they were close friends and they deserved to share that achievement with him. All the people you see in the picture that BSP posted were NOT in his hiking party - that was the total of people who had hiked up independently, and the ones who had hiked with Jurek. The picture BSP posted is quite misleading. Overall, watching Jurek accomplish this awesome feat made my first summit of Katahdin all that much more special - it was incredible to witness, I felt honored to be there and it did not detract from my experience at all. I will summit Katahdin again someday, but I don't expect any summit experience to ever be so memorable as my first."""

Maine,3djxz0,russianpotato,9,Fri Jul 17 02:34:58 2015 UTC,"You're all hating on the rangers, but I love that BSP has such protective rangers.  If someone hiked to the top in 1850, and they could do it again in 2050, I want there to be as little change as possible.  This 'party' may not be that big of a deal on its own, but rangers have to worry about the precedent it sets... especially as the trails get more crowded with each passing year.  It's an impressive feat to do the AT in only 6 weeks, but that shouldn't give anyone the right to break the rules which are intended to keep BSP preserved and protected for generations to come."
Maine,3djxz0,KosherNazi,3,Fri Jul 17 13:27:52 2015 UTC,"Is it their policy to use other people's photos and shame them publicly every time there's a citation? I don't have a problem that they cited them, but their Facebook post is childish and in poor taste."
Maine,3djxz0,ErichUberSonic,5,Fri Jul 17 14:23:02 2015 UTC,"He's literally sold his image to corporate sponsors... but it's invasive for BSP to display those same photos linked everywhere else online right now?  The Facebook post probably wasn't the best route for them to take, but I agree with the sentiment.  The AT and BSP shouldn't be turned into a commercialized space.  These places were originally protected by people who love nature, and the peace and solitude it provides.  Commercial activities are allowed, these people just need to get permits.  The goal is fair use.  The sort of people who ignore these needs, and just treat shared woodlands like their own personal playgrounds to use however they please, could use a public shaming now and then.  My tax dollars help support BSP.  If Clif bar, REI, LLBean, and whoever else are going to be making money based on activities in the park, then I damn sure want BSP to get its miniscule permit fees, and for the people partaking to act respectful.  Just because he set a record doesn't excuse his disregard of park policies, policies which exist to make sure every can benefit from the park equally."
Maine,3djxz0,KosherNazi,4,Fri Jul 17 18:27:30 2015 UTC,"They really should have figured out a more tactful way of getting this message out. You are right about the permit fees and it's a shame that BSP basically shot themselves in the foot on this one. The masses are only going to gang up on them with negativity instead of receiving their message.  That said, I've not hiked Katahdin and never been to BSP. Totally unaware there were rules about hiking party numbers. All this social media makes me feel a bit illegitimate as a 28yr old, life-long Mainer... meaning it's making me want to go hike it.  I really wonder what sort of spike in activity/rule-breaking they've sown...."

It'd be another story if he wasn't against student voter registration, but he voted against that, too.  Against penalties for unauthorized private gun sales.  Against raising minimum wage  14% approval by maine women's lobby, 100% approval maine right to life. For restricting transgender access to bathrooms to an individuals birth gender, because treatment for dysphoria in an effort to alleviate significant stressors is nothing more than being some crossdressing pervert, I guess. And who actually needs empathy for those who are different than we are anyway?  Voted against recognizing same sex marraiges from other states, before Maine achieved marriage equality.  He refused to attend the meeting regarding Mike Willettes racist facebook posts but instead focuses on the hard hitting cultural issues of our time, like whether or not the amish can wear orange.   edit: ...I just realized he's got an AOL address as his primary contact.

Maine,3ddkwg,PrinceMunjoy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:00:33 2015 UTC,I admire LePage on the level that he was once some homeless kid who  had to work to get to where he is... even if he is a bit of a hothead and occasional buffoon. He's also never really been outright bigoted like Thibodeau is proud to be.   I'd rather keep LePage and all of his relatively mean spirited Biden-ism than have someone like Thibodeau in the Blaine house.

I think ""Liberals"", and people in general, don't like LePage because he's a raving asshole. That shit he pulled, blackmailing a school to fire someone he doesn't like?

The fact you idiots constantly attack him without a bit of merit is what makes it ""buttrage.""   You can't claim that everyone who dislikes LePage is an idiot. That's idiocy. Nor can you prove that all who have ""attacked"" him do so relentlessly. Nor can you prove that any of those ""attacks"" were without merit. Maybe there are people whom dislike him who also happen to be less intelligent. That doesn't mean everyone who agrees with this person's argument is also less intelligent. It just means two different perspectives have drawn the same conclusion.  You've used nothing but insults to make your ""point"", I cringe to call it.

Bring the public back to the dark ages, put them right at the edge of despondency. That way everyone has to come crawling to them for support. They want us to slave to them like in the old days. Make it so slavery looks good compared to the alternative.   Change is good, and we are terrible regarding human services here in America. Our leaders are swayed by money, and corporate interests end up ruling like they were elected leaders. I can see no reason why anyone in the common populace would want to cut human services. That means more mentally ill persons roaming the streets untreated. More families becoming dependent on welfare, because they can't get off their feet. Local business goes down the drain, taking away money from communities and putting it in corporate pockets, to be invested elsewhere.  I could go on, but supporters of conservative ideals are shooting themselves in the foot. Unless you are a considerably wealthy individual, you'll probably need some help one day. What if your health declines? You might be able to afford to fix yourself, with some insurance debt to boot. But now your rates are higher, and the next time you get hurt you're boned.

Maine,3df5fr,skrunkle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:09:15 2015 UTC,I want to see it legalized however possible so for that reason I support both initiatives.That said I feel like if MPP's campaigns have worked in other states then their regulations have a better chance of succeeding here and adopting a working model. This spreadsheet (sponsored by the MPP) compares the differences in initiatives. https://www.regulatemaine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Maine-Comparison.pdf[1] In what ways do you believe Mainers won't be protected?

I agree that that's a possibility but Maine has growers ready and willing to sell to a legal market if it's ever made available; there's already high quality available in Maine. What I really want to see is Maine take further steps towards legalization. Protecting Maine growers is important to me ultimately I still feel Maine will benefit regardless of the initiative so my decision fell to what I felt was most likely to happen. We need legal weed on the east coast.   this link to the comparison should work:  https://www.regulatemaine.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Maine-Comparison.pdf"
Maine,3df5fr,skrunkle,2,Fri Jul 17 00:08:34 2015 UTC,"So I made your link work by removing the [1] at the end. and. here is my take on the comparison.  Six total plants is preposterous. I already despise the limit on flowering plants because that legislates the type of plant and the style of grow. Certain strains of hemp such as autoflowering strains are right out the window. It's pointless to grow six plants that are so small. These plants are commonly used in a grow style called ""Sea of Green"". and the language of both initiatives basically outlaws that grow style even though it doesn't generate any more bud per watt of light than any other method. It's a totally arbitrary number. Now as for six total as opposed to Six flowering. If I can't keep nonflowering plants then how is a home grower supposed to clone for each cycle? If I am going to keep my lights working then I need three separate rooms clone veg and bud. Six plants total doesn't cut it.  I also take issue with the limitation on the number of retail stores in the state. This is a large and sprawling state. I do not want to have to go to bangor (An hour away) to go to the pot store when I should be able to purchase from my own little coop here in town. those artificial limitations only serve to keep the tax base from those operations out of the possibility for smaller towns, and push commerce more and more into the larger cities (That's bad unless you are from portland L/A Augusta or Bangor).   TL;DR: My main interest is in keeping profits as localized and diverse as possible and the MPP has proven in other states that they can't do that. and the language to take control of those issues is not currently included in their initiative."
Maine,3df5fr,mainlydank,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:04:51 2015 UTC,I suppose my perspective is different since I live on the coast. I'm interested in home cultivation as well its my understanding that at maximum growing something like 2 flowering plants 2 veg and 2 seedlings would give an individual enough supply until their next two plants would start flowering and/or be ready for harvest. I dont have much experience in large quantity grows. I suppose the campaign to regulate marijuana like alcohol imagines that if you're growing more than 6 plants then you're planning to sell it in which case you should be establishing yourself as a legal operation within the confines of the law. It's my understanding that the 6 plants is a personal limit establishing to stop individuals from overproducing. I guess my next question for you has to be how much you smoke in a month? even if its like 2 oz you'd get about that much from one plant wouldn't you?. I see where you're coming from but I'm just curious about why you want to be growing such a supply unless you want to sell it off?
Maine,3df5fr,skrunkle,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:15:52 2015 UTC,again you are making assumptions about the strains I wish to grow. Yes many strains can be big producers. But other strains are not. I know of many very good strains that will produce an ounce or less per plant. But I can't possibly grow those as they would only waste my time with the artificial limitations imposed by this legislation. Now that that is said please explain to me what is so harmful about a grower selling his weed to a consenting adult? This is another big divide between MPP and LM. MPP wants to regulate pot like alcohol. Pot is nothing like alcohol. Alcohol is unarguably dangerous. Pot is demonstrably safer on all counts than alcohol or cigarettes. People die every day from alcohol poisoning. but no one ever anywhere has ever died from THC toxicity. You can die from nicotine poisoning as well. But no one ever has been killed with an overdose of pot.

Rural areas are usually right leaning, so it helped.

Maine,3deyz4,skrunkle,10,Wed Jul 15 19:40:39 2015 UTC,is that bear story really true?   At least partly yes. We had a bear hunting bill that tried to outlaw both bear baiting and hunting bears with dogs. It was a fucked up bill because it lumped both activities together. Most moderate Mainers wanted to allow baiting but outlaw dogs. so by lumping them together it drew a very conservative crowd to the polls that normally would only have shown up in much lower %'s  EDIT: spelling

The bear baiting referendum definitely brought out the conservative vote, and the liberal vote wasn't fired up because of a weak campaign.    We really need ranked voting to be a thing.

Maine,3deyz4,tnk207,8,Thu Jul 16 03:30:00 2015 UTC,"Echoing someone else's comments about how he got elected twice, but perhaps with a little more detail: He won the first time when there was a very weak democratic candidate whom the party had no interest in. She had very little money, support or enthusiasm behind her campaign. Eliot Cutler came in as a third, independent candidate and had a very good chance to win. Still, a lot of progressives vote for the progressive candidate no matter what, even if that person is not the best candidate for a liberal agenda and Libby Mitchell's candidacy wound up pulling votes away from Cutler.   The second time around, the Democratic candidate, Mike Michaud was set to be the first openly gay governor. The democrats loved him for this reason. The problem for a lot of us - myself included -  was that he was not the best candidate. He was not a bad candidate. He was certainly much better than LePage, but he was a bit of a hypocrite. He'd voted against protections for gays and women in the past when it was politically expedient to be a more conservative politician in Maine. Years later, when Maine had become more liberal on the whole and the Democrats wanted to put money behind a very liberal candidate (and a gay one at a time when the party was riding high on adding marriage equality to their platform) Michaud tried champion himself as a staunch liberal and not own up to his past. A lot of people like me, who grew up gay here, and who remembered the old Mike Michaud, weren't especially excited about the idea of handing him the governorship just because he came out.   The same independent candidate ran again, and I truly believe he was the best candidate, but his campaign never had the muscle that it did the first time around. I regret being idealistic and putting so much time, money and effort behind the person I thought was the best candidate rather than the person I thought could beat LePage. If everyone like me had not supported Cutler and had just gone with Michaud, he'd have won. He might not have deserved it, but we wouldn't have the debacle we have in front of us now.   On a totally unrelated, kind of petty sidenote: You know how people talk about guys like Ted Cruz and say ""he's not stupid, he's just playing to his base."" I am reasonably confident, as are most Mainers at this point, that Paul LePage is actually just stupid."

Maine,3deyz4,attilad,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:48:31 2015 UTC,Libby Mitchell's campaign also produced the most damaging attack ads against Cutler.
Maine,3deyz4,Simonov,3,Thu Jul 16 16:02:49 2015 UTC,"This current veto thing is interesting because there are two stories -    the governor was waiting until after the recess to deliver his vetos so that the house and senate would have ample time to review them or  the governor tried to pocket-veto the bills when he couldn't, then tried to cover that up by delivering 65 vetos after the bills were already law.   LePage's largest campaign financer for the first election--at least at the start--was Marden's, a chain of large surplus and salvage stores (kind of like Ocean State Job Lot) that LePage previously managed.  A lot of his early acts as governor could be interpreted as directly benefiting stores like Marden's.  One thing many people haven't realized is that LePage has raised our property taxes.  There is (was) a mechanism in Maine where a portion of state taxes went to a pool that was redistributed to Maine communities.  It makes sense because a lot of young adults from all over the state migrate south for college and end up settling around the Portland area.  I looked at it as being able to contribute to the midcoast community that raised me while living here in Southern Maine.  LePage rerouted that money for his budget, and left every single Maine community with a last-minute huge hole in their budget, some cases after the municipal budgets had already been approved.  Even prosperous towns were getting a portion of that money from state taxes and weren't prepared to have it withheld.  Most towns have had to either slash their school budgets or raise property taxes, or both.    He has fanatical followers in the poor, undereducated demographic that can't seem to understand that what he's done has directly hurt their quality of life.  You had to sell your four-wheeler to help pay the taxes on your mom's double-wide because the program that helped her pay for food was defunded, for fuck's sake...  oh but fireworks and concealed handguns are now legal so there's that."
Maine,3deyz4,giantslor,2,Thu Jul 16 16:25:54 2015 UTC,"He got elected in 2010 because the democrat (Libby Mitchell) split the vote between the independent (Eliot Cutler) and LePage.  I think LePage got ~38%, Cutler ~36%, and Mitchell ~20%.  LePage did and said a lot of stupid crap in his first term and the democrats thought they could win with anyone so they put out a weak candidate instead of a good one.  The attitude of ""nobody we put out can be as bad as LePage"" coupled with voters who were sick of democrats nationwide/the bear baiting question caused Michaud to lose. LePage got 48.5% of the vote the second time around, he would have won even if Cutler wasn't an option.  Over the past few months LePage has gotten crazier and crazier.  It's a shame that most of the anti-LePage people here still blame Cutler for splitting the vote both times instead of recognizing that the democrats put forth bad candidates (including the previous governor TBH).  The democrats won't beat the republicans (or independents) until they start putting out better candidates.  Hopefully LePage's 2nd term will get them to do that next time.

Maybe their family wouldn't be able to come to grips with their new lifestyle... but they've probably known about their ""liberal"" tendencies since they were young. They may have thought about coming out earlier when Lepage made those comments about ""giving it to the voters without vaseline"". Either way, it's at the boiling point where they can't suppress it any longer--- they need to tell someone- anyone who will listen--- the story of their true feelings.

Maine,3ddki6,PrinceMunjoy,3,Wed Jul 15 16:32:43 2015 UTC,"*most.  I work on developments in town as an engineer. The fact of the matter is that people will pay for this kind of apartment as long as there's a housing surplus (AKA: 1-2% vacancy). If there is higher vacancy (6-7% is typically healthy) then it gives the consumer, or renter, more options and ability to find cheaper alternatives. Supply and demand they say.  Portland is really, really great on creating incentives and zoning ordiances for sustainable and visually appealing developments. The planning board is great, and overall my experiences have been better than most other cities. I don't know this developer personally but have heard some good things, and from what I've heard this project looks to be pretty good.  tl;dr I am excite."
Maine,3ddki6,guethlema,2,Thu Jul 16 02:01:00 2015 UTC,Yeah I've been trying to follow and learn more about the market as I just recently bought a two unit in Portland.  As much as I would benefit from a low vacancy rate in the city it's good to see development like this happen so it's not just rich people who can afford to live here.

Maine,3dc7op,Guygan,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:38:17 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry but I have to disagree with you here, you cannot just compare the out right price and you cannot compare to a car.  Maintenence:  You will spend at least 10% of the boats value every year, you do this or you die, cuz its a boat.  I have never spent this much maintaining a car in its lifetime.  Useful:  You much less limited in where you can go in a car then a small sailboat.  Yes im talking a small boat here because anything large enough for open sea is already waaaaaay out of our price range.  End result,  a car is cheaper per mile, costs less per mile to run and goes more places then this small sailboat of yours.  Here is my priority, I never spend more then like 2K on a car, you gonna find me anything bigger then a bathtub for that?"

Maine,3dc7op,jotch,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:43:19 2015 UTC,The cheapest way? I would prolly seduce an elderly widow whose estate includes a yacht... or Jackal my way on board a cruise with deception and disguise... Or just straight up GTA it... head right down to the docks and execute whomever stands between you and your ride... preferably with your fists to keep the costs down.
Maine,3dc7op,Ninjakick666,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:05:11 2015 UTC,"This is a really broad question.  Are you into racing or leisure sailing?  How much experience do you already have?  Are you looking at ""cheapest"" in the short-term just to get on the water, the ""cheapest"" to get a boat (again, which type do you want), the ""cheapest"" in terms of ""least-likely-for-you-to-kill-yourself-and-your-loved-ones-on-while-starting-out"" or how would you define it precisely?  Do you want just something for day sailing or taking weekend trips or month+ trips?  Clubs will most likely get you on the water for day sailing or racing (for the former you might be better off joining a class for an MBA and dropping it when you make a friend with a boat, for the latter people always need rail meat.)  If you have moderate experience you should be able to charter a boat for outings (though even without experience you can do so at a higher cost if you are willing to pay for a captain - though you would probably be better off doing it as a charter/training type of thing if it is going to be more than a one-off experience [realistically you'll still be able to get some training with a charter boat and dedicated captain, but they might be less inclined to hand-holding unless you are a really good conversationalist and you click with them.])  If you are talking about buying a relatively cheap (cash, safety and ease of use) boat I'd recommend the MacGregor 26 because they are damn near unsinkable and somewhat oceanworthy if you can find one (the people that founded it retired and closed the business, but their daughter and son-in-law apparently started a company manufacturing a similar boat at http://tattooyachts.com/ - I can't speak to that one as I have no experience with it.)  I'm assuming you aren't looking at more than a 26' boat at this point because beyond that you're really getting into a lot more personal preference than anything else.  You might even be able to get somewhat of a feel for it with a windsail if you are just starting out (though that might be a bit more fun if you buy a plane ticket to an island that doesn't have rocks all around it and water that isn't frigid - or at least go to a lake for it.)"

Maine,3dba3t,otakugrey,11,Tue Jul 14 22:58:16 2015 UTC,"Portland is an active port town, with bulk ships passing through on a daily basis. Most people that work at the docks process fish. There are also jobs unloading freight, working in the small rail yard that leads to the docks, and basic ship maintenance. Most jobs pay minimum wage. The best jobs are the union jobs, such as the teamsters (truck drivers) or other jobs that are based on a trade (marine mechanic, steel worker, welder, electrician, etc.). Your best bet would be to get a job ""pushing a broom"" or other menial work until you can get into one of the trade jobs, get training, benefits, union wages and a decent level of job security.

Genetics do not predict behavior. Whether you believe in science or the bible, we are all descended from one mitochondrial ""Eve."" We are all quite closely related. Over the past 50k years (quite short, in evolutionary terms,) we've been a few clusters in a small family.  People learn helplessness. People learn to be great. The idea that someone can be suddenly thrust into a situation and turn into a world-class Green Beret Ninja World Leader is ridiculous. That isn't genetics, it's training.

Genes are more the upper limit - there are countless ways to fuck an individual up regardless of them.  Every little difference does matter, while evolution may lack elegance (just look at the countless sociological and physiological aspects of what makes us us as an indicator of that: women and men tend toward opposite extremes of emotion and logic in a subconscious game to maximize the flow of their genes into the next generation, instead of culturing more resilient gut bacteria to aid our digestive systems we evolved a whole new organ prone to inflammation and life-threatening rupture just to replace less resilient gut bacteria when they fail and the technological/intellectual facilities to physically remove that organ when it fails - all to make diarrhea a bit more survivable) evolution does take every seemingly petty little thing into account.  It comes down to where we want to see the species go.  Do we want people that are so dependent on our hacks to make up for the failings of genetics that we need machines to think for us and even to keep us alive - eventually resting the survival of the species as a whole on our ability to maintain an absurdly sophisticated set of machines and the logistics associated with them - or do we want people that are physically fit and intelligent enough to survive on their own if the tech fails for whatever reason?"

I doubt there's even a single individual on his payroll that is even close to being affected by this.    You really think that there are no small business owners who use Means' services that would oppose this?   He's got a degree in governance, of course he knows that his most useful allies are going to be the city's wealthy. Why else would someone with no prior fiduciary experience work there?    Whether the change goes into effect or not, it will have zero effect on the way he conducts business.   If this change goes into effect it means less profit for those who would presumably use his services. Muffy and Preston need their summer home, after all."
Maine,3d9r18,CollectTheColdWar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:22:15 2015 UTC,It's not unbelievable to assume that small business owners may use a wealth management service.   It is not unbelievable to assume that an employee of that service would seek to represent his clients interest should he be elected to local government.   Or is it the idea that small business owners and those who already have theirs would be against raising minimum wage the idea that you have an objection to?

Maine,3d5s02,radministator,9,Tue Jul 14 01:21:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a native of the state. Here's my problem. Maine is historically a poor state. Maine doesn't have enough revenue to afford to house and provide for thousands of people who don't work, and the vast majority of them aren't educated to the point where they can make a positive monetary impact on the state economy once they are granted permanent visas. It's not the Asylum seekers that are at fault for this, they are flung into the situation but the government should know better. How this bill was even introduced is beyond me.  What business do we have attempting to take care of assistance seekers when we can barely fix roads, provide quality education and make sure that native Mainers are taken care of first. It may sound callous and cruel but the state needs to worry about ways to generate jobs north of Portland instead of taking care of people who won't be producing anything for the economy for at least 6 months. Send them to Texas, where the economy is robust enough to support the extra load."

Maine,3d1rch,neuromonkey,10,Mon Jul 13 14:41:24 2015 UTC,"edit: He's probably trying to distract from his $500,000 blackmailing of the Good Will-Hinckley School, while destroying the career of a political opponent, House Speaker Mark Eves.  He's an asshole, but not stupid. This was deliberate. Whether he wanted to create a furor to draw attention from another issue, or there was some other benefit to starting a high-profile, pointless pissing contest, it was no mistake. Maybe he wants to be impeached to rile the base to vote for the next pro-wealth Republican Governor.  In any case, the man thrives on contentious, adversarial politics. Like a shopper who yells and screams and finally gets a concession from a store manager, he puts a lot of effort into framing situations in particular, totally screwed-up ways, and pounds and pounds on his assertions until the more malleable, frustrated, angry, suspicious citizens start to think he sounds rational.  He has said, several times and in different situations that the executive branch of the government should be immune from the rule of law, and beyond the reach of the judiciary. His primary approach is grandstanding and stubborn, unfounded assertions of his finger-painted ""reality."" He wraps that in folksy attempts at humor and illogical, faux-common-sense aphorisms. For the big population of Mainers who are deeply suspicious of new things, progressive ideas, and critical thought, it's easy to get reeled in to his cockeyed dog & pony show, and steered away from rational understanding.  It's politics. He's a damned good politician, performer, and marketer. I believe him to be a horrendous, evil human being who prioritizes the interests of the wealthy over those of the rest of the population. Unfortunately, he's spectacularly good at getting middle class and poor Mainers to vote against their own interests. He'll try to strike down spending on healthcare for children, and funding for clinics for recovering drug addicts, while simultaneously saying that Maine ""must pay its debts"" to predatory, criminal financial entities that transparently, overtly robbed the state of Maine of millions of dollars. (Many more besides LePage were paid off in that particular scam.)  He knows that one of the principal pillars of power is wealth. He does all he can, at all times to work to ensure that wealth continues to be centralized. Far beyond being simply ""bought,"" he and politicians and lobbyists like him are fundamental movers in the ""politics industry.""  What is he doing, and why? I'm not certain--I'd have to do a lot of learning and analysis (edit: see above)--but he's a power-mad, parasitic cocksucker in a world where such men and women often come out on top. He's showing his base that He Means Business, and that He'll Never Give Up, knowing all the while that it's ineffectual nonsense. It's all about the sound and the fury of Fighting The Good Fight.  Fuck him, and fuck anyone like him. He'll retire in style with many, many lucrative deals."

In fact, unless you are REALLY throwing it in our faces, you will get nothing more than a fine, more likely than not your weed dumped on the ground. P.S.  If your a dick about it, you will get a ticket.   Now, let's pop a myth, you can not be arrested in Maine for possession. Trafficking?  Yep, but it's very, very rare now. This being a Maine forum, let's stick with Maine Law shall we?  In fact, the last person to do any hard time in Maine for weed had a grow the size of a township.  Dont believe me? Check the police logs in the local paper. In my county tickets issued for weed possession have dropped over 60% in the last few years. For the most part, we've given up.  Do I search cars based on a strong odor?  You bet. You wouldn't believe the amount of much harder drugs I find that way. Mostly Oxy, but ""H""  is making a comeback. Do I think weed will be legal?  Yep, and soon. Do I think my ability to search cars based on smell is going to disappear?  Yep, and soon. Do I think it's the be all end all?  Nope. I think that we will see a rise in OUI marijuana cases. I think that there will be a whole "" I drive better when I'm high"" defense I'll have to deal with. Other than that, do I give a shit?  Nope.  Smoke up. Stay off the road. Let the down votes begin."

Based on probable cause you would have access to my vehicle, but am I correct to say that you wouldn't have access to the trunk without something more concrete like a warrant?  Thanks for your extended reply, I think that many citizens would agree that the Maine police have been relatively understanding about marijuana since they generally represent the public and the public is changing its views on the substance.  Would the state police support legalization openly should it come to a ballot?"

Maine,3d1i7q,Digipete,0,Thu Jul 16 03:44:36 2015 UTC,"most of us don't really give a rats ass about weed   Beautiful. It seems like the grass roots movement toward legalization is working. Police are finally wisening up on this topic. I saw WAY too many of my friends, most of which were good people, get arrested and have to deal with the courts back in the 80s and 90's.   In my county tickets issued for weed possession have dropped over 60% in the last few years.   That 40% is still too many. Remember, you get paid to go to court. We don't. Between the possible fine and time taken off work, plus the issues later on with employment (Let's face it, it is still a ""record"", which is looked on as bad by some, generally older, employers), It can be quite an expensive situation.   Do I search cars based on a strong odor? You bet. You wouldn't believe the amount of much harder drugs I find that way. Mostly Oxy, but ""H"" is making a comeback.    I'm willing to bet that you are finding ""User"" levels for the most part. I am against those drugs myself. Hell, most of the people I have known that take those drugs would rather get off them themselves. Instead they get fines and jail time. I would MUCH rather pay my tax money for rehabilitation programs and the like then spend it on drug agents, courts and all the infrastructure supporting them, and jails including their infrastructure. You have to admit. Fining these people and jailing them does nothing for their chemical dependency and the life that got them that way. In fact it makes it worse.   I think that there will be a whole "" I drive better when I'm high"" defense I'll have to deal with.   Now this is a controversial statement on my own part, but most all of the high drivers I've ridden with DO drive better than a lot of others in the general public. They always seem a lot more conscientious than you would think. Plus, If you are going after them, you probably should go after Grandma  Edna and her weird medication cocktail from four different doctors."
Maine,3d1i7q,Parrothead1970,5,Mon Jul 13 10:21:12 2015 UTC,"Also let's look at a few other things. A class ""E"" crime states up to 6 months in jail or a fine up to 1000 dollars. No one goes to jail on a class E for six months. I can't get wife beaters any jail time on a class C domestic aggravated assault, I mean none. Class D such as OUI states up to one year in jail and a fine not to exceed 2000 dollars. Average?  Two days in jail and a 500 dollar fine plus loss of license. Again look at the court news in the local paper. Do the math. It does not do a cause good to spread too much information or base your argument based on vague misinformation. Let it go dude, legalization is going to happen, as long as the pro weed factions don't piss too many people off."

To be honest I support legalization in Maine even though i do not use. I have to say, however, that your post claims ""facts"" and cites no sources. An ""American study"" isn't a source. Also presenting a barrage of statistics isn't going to propel your argument. You need to describe your statistics and tell us why they matter without the standard political/infomercial sensationalism.  You are trying to change something in a political fashion. Your best shot is to change the way its done. By presenting us with ""facts"" that ""scientists proved"" you are immediately losing anyone with experience in the sciences or expertise in logical/analytical fields. All that does is tell us that your agenda is just as groundless as you claim your opposition is. By citing actual sources that you've investigated and explaining the context of your statistics as well as ditching the sensational rhetoric you'll actually make a much stronger argument that won't only sound, but will be more legitimate.  Again, I don't disagree with you and I am not trying to be a dick, I just feel that if you want to see this change than you need to play a different song than the rest of the media and political sphere else you get lost in the noise."

Maine,3d1i7q,giantslor,4,Sun Jul 12 20:43:47 2015 UTC,"0 of the two parties petitioning for legal recreational cannabis are opposed to ""Home-Grows"". 0 states in the USA that have passed recreational cannabis laws have allowed for remuneration (selling for profit) between private parties on a recreational level.   In any state in the USA ""Johnny Cannabis"" cannot legally buy from his cousin anyways and faces jail time for doing so as well as his cousin would face jail time. Further, in the state of Maine even though you will not face jail time for possessing, you face a fine for a civil crime. Under our proposed ballot measure, you could posess 2.5 Oz of product without fine or legal action of any kind.  The appropriate and more common sense question is ""Why not legalize""? If your going to break the law by purchasing from a non regulated private party anyways, why not have the piece of mind that if you get pulled over 5 miles down the road and are caught in possession of it that you are not going to get a fine? For that matter, why not grow your own if its legal?"
Maine,3d1i7q,mainlydank,-8,Sun Jul 12 20:56:22 2015 UTC,"You're never going to pass a ""grow your own"" law... why would they put 90% of the cops around here out of a job and not get any tax money out of the deal?

Maine,3d1i7q,maineac,5,Sun Jul 12 21:00:48 2015 UTC,"""Those who say something cannot be done, should not interrupt those who are doing it""  It is perfectly legal to grow your own cannabis for recreational use in Colorado. 90% of police officers in the state when asked have said that they would appreciate taking the cannabis issue off their plate so they can focus on more serious and violent crimes. Beyond that, the tax and fee's revenue from recreational cannabis legality will exceed 5000% of the revenue earned from enforcing marijuana laws. It costs $78 a day to keep someone incarcerated in this state, and that's on the low end. That is $2340 for every body in jail or prison per month. The average fine for possession of marijuana is less than $600 and with medical marijuana already legal the revenue gained from fines does not even cover the expense of enforcing the laws.   Everyone is entitled to have their beliefs, but before you make statements as if they were facts and further try to convince people that what your saying has merit, please put in a few minutes to read the studies, look at the economic impact reports from states which have already legalized, and at least browse through the state published facts. I applaud that you care enough to write anything at all on the issue and support you in voicing your opinions, but saying things like ""90% of police will lose their jobs"" & ""No tax money will be generated"" are 100% false, 100% speculation, and 100% opinion which has many times been documented to be wrong. That in and of itself wears out the good will of the people who casually care about this topic."

Why not Cannabis.  Now its time for my questions. Do you have a monetary interest in this? How many hours a day do you spend behind a computer playing armchair politics? Have you been here? Did you read last years OUI reports before you say we have no other crime here? I am not going to even begin to go into Meth arrests, domestic violence reports, and violent offenses.

Marijuana is decriminalized in Maine, but if you get caught cultivating without a MMJ permit, you face fines and jail. If someone wanted to fine me and throw my in jail for cultivating my tomatoes & garlic, i might be heavily in favor of legalizing tomatoes too. Decriminalization of possession is nice, a fine and a slap on the wrist i would be ok with, but why force someone to deal with a true criminal by definition of Maine law that is willing to cultivate? It's a plant, it has many benefits, like many other plants, but if i want to grow it without a MMJ permit, i go to jail? Replace the words marijuana and cannabis with tomatoes and you see why decriminalization as it is now does not work."

Maine,3d0ov7,93_Vector,9,Sun Jul 12 17:08:41 2015 UTC,I was a cashier at Shaws back when the state issued paper food stamps. Change was given with back in regular coins. It was not uncommon to have families come in and have all the children buy the cheapest thing in the store they could find in separate transactions... a single doughnut hole at something like 15¢ was a popular one. Each got 85¢ back and passed it on to mom or dad at the end of the line. Mom or dad used the change to buy their Newports. The scheme was much more efficient than the bottle redemption tactic.

Maine,3d0ov7,cronin1024,8,Sun Jul 12 19:37:47 2015 UTC,"Returning the bottles gives you cash money, whereas buying them with food stamps/ EBT is not cash money. So this is a way of transferring electronic money that isn't allowed to become paper money into paper money at the cost of water.  Albeit wasteful and stupid as fuck, I'll admit, it was thought out pretty well."
Maine,3d0ov7,Shpeck,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:13:04 2015 UTC,"I was suggesting that food stamps not cover the cost of the bottle return. If they need a bottle of soda or water, the food stamps can cover the purchase price but not the deposit."

Maine,3d0ov7,Ninjakick666,6,Tue Jul 14 02:17:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how many will agree work me, but I don't see this as fraud. She used her food stamps to buy a product she is allowed to purchase, then she returned the bottles, as she is also legally allowed to do. What she does with the water is wasteful for sure, but isn't she allowed to do as she please with the things she buys? She is allowed to drink the water, give it out to others, donate it to a food drive, or dump it out if she pleases. The state gives her assistance for her financial hardship, but it's only hurting herself if she wastes the money in this way."
Maine,3d0ov7,jrmurph,8,Sun Jul 12 19:59:42 2015 UTC,"I think the fine line, is that she used the card legally, but then used the product she bought to solely acquire cash with it. You can then look at it as a cash transaction, not the act of acquiring food with the assistance. You've used government assistance with the specific goal of acquiring cash. At this point, it becomes fraud.  I see it more as waste, and illness. I've no idea why we need punitive actions for this foolery. Someone needs drug addiction help, not fines and prison."
Maine,3d0ov7,xPersistentx,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:22:25 2015 UTC,"She is not only hurting herself when she does stuff like that. She didn't need the water, which is clear by the fact that she dumped it. If she didn't need it, she shouldn't have bought it.  That would have left more money in the food stamps fund to help others who use the money how it should be used."
Maine,3d0ov7,gittenlucky,9,Mon Jul 13 01:29:08 2015 UTC,I don't see how this is a crime... She's using a loophole left by lawmakers with no foresight
Maine,3d0ov7,giantslor,4,Sun Jul 12 17:14:41 2015 UTC,"The thing that upsets me about this is that she has been given a resource because of some disadvantage that she has in society. The very least that she could do is be thankful for this resource, not wasteful. And, to top it all off, it's dishonest of her. There are people who worked hard to give her that resource. It's fraudulent."
Maine,3d0ov7,toomuchinternet7,0,Mon Jul 13 02:00:46 2015 UTC,"It's obviously not a good thing to do, but what is the language that makes it a crime punishable by a year in jail? Is it a crime if she takes a swig off each bottle before she dumps it out? Is it a crime if she uses it to fill up her radiator and then returns the bottles? It's been a problem that people point out for quite some time and nobody has done anything about it.  For all of the complaining about the punishment that you'd get for, say, I don't know,  possession of marijuana... I can't believe people here think a year in jail is appropriate for someone who steals 38 bucks."
Maine,3d0ov7,giantslor,2,Mon Jul 13 02:10:28 2015 UTC,"You have good points but for clarity, she stole $125 from the SNAP program because the state still had to hand that money over to the grocery store.  She just only had access to $38."
Maine,3d0ov7,-sixandseven-,5,Mon Jul 13 14:45:52 2015 UTC,"Welfare fraud is a crime so whether you see it as a crime or not is really relevant.  There's also no loophole, the terms of programs like SNAP are very clear."
Maine,3d0ov7,uzimonkey,-1,Sun Jul 12 19:15:26 2015 UTC,C'Mon man... you've interpreted this law as being very clear... what if she takes one sip then dumps?
Maine,3d0ov7,giantslor,-5,Sun Jul 12 19:30:35 2015 UTC,It's a crime if she dumps the liquid... it's not a crime if she drinks it. What if she drinks half and then dumps it? Is that still fraud your honor?
Maine,3d0ov7,giantslor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know, look at the statutes.  Though they're not always clear, the law is not a robot that draws perfectly straight lines and deciding whether an action meets the statutes is part of what judges and juries do.  This is nothing new though.  A few years ago one of the organic milks in the grocery store came in old-timey milk bottles that had like a 50 cent return because the company really wanted these bottles back to reuse.  So what happens around the 10th of every month?  That milk is sold out and almost immediately the bottles are returned.  That's straight up fraud if they're not drinking the milk, they're stealing the SNAP money to pay for booze or cigarettes or drugs or comic books or video games or whatever it is they're spending this money on."
Maine,3d0ov7,uzimonkey,2,Sun Jul 12 19:33:29 2015 UTC,It could all be solved if the benefits didn't cover bottle deposits which is what these assclowns should have done when the milk bottle thing was happening.
Maine,3d0ov7,giantslor,-2,Sun Jul 12 19:35:47 2015 UTC,where is old ironsides... errr /u/guygan to interpret statutes when you need him?
Maine,3d0ov7,giantslor,-2,Sun Jul 12 20:32:50 2015 UTC,okay.  big corps use tax loopholes left by law makers with no foresight to make a favorable tax situation for themselves.  we know you would be on here whining about that.
Maine,3d0ov7,swintec,5,Sun Jul 12 17:23:25 2015 UTC,Nobody faces jail time for that... But it's a year for stealing $38.
Maine,3d0ov7,giantslor,4,Sun Jul 12 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"she wont see any jail time or fine, and will be sentenced to time served."
Maine,3d0ov7,alwaysready,7,Sun Jul 12 17:44:32 2015 UTC,Still dumb. The problem is that they don't pay the deposit out of pocket.
Maine,3d0ov7,giantslor,2,Sun Jul 12 17:55:28 2015 UTC,wow
Maine,3d0ov7,c4rlos4lv4rez,2,Sun Jul 12 19:54:05 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately not everyone can be helped no matter how hard you try. Wasting time and resources on things like this is pointless. One night in jail will cost the taxpayer more than the crime itself and most likely not solve the underlying problem, which could be due to a mixture of addiction, lack of jobs, etc.  Trying to close loopholes is also pointless as by the time you've done that, they have come up with another way to beat the system. At some point people just need to do the right thing, you can't keep coming up with laws because some people refuse to obey the rules."
Maine,3d0ov7,ScreenSaver24,9,Mon Jul 13 01:08:50 2015 UTC,"She’s accused of buying $125 in water bottle cases, pouring the water out, then returning the bottles to get back $38.   Okay, that's dumb. Why did she do this though? Why did she need that $38 dollars? I'd be curious to know. Maybe for rent? A car payment? Drugs?   If convicted, she faces a $2,000 fine and nearly a year in jail.   Now hang on a second. A $2,000 fine and a year of jail time for cheating the state out of - at most - $125? How the hell is that fair? That's ruining this lady's life over a couple twenties that she might have needed to pay the rent.  Edit - I seem to have created a shitstorm here, so let me elaborate on what I'm saying: this punishment feels particularly harsh to me, and the kind of penalty that will put this person - who is already in need of assistance - much, much deeper into a hole that she may never be able get out of. It's the kind of penalty that ensures that she will need more state assistance in the future, not less."
Maine,3d0ov7,octaviusromulus,9,Sun Jul 12 17:12:02 2015 UTC,"Now hang on a second. A $2,000 fine and a year of jail time for cheating the state out of - at most - $125?   It's not the $125, it's the aid. This aid is a lifeline for many people and should not be abused.   How the hell is that fair?    It's not. It's not fair to everyone paying taxes for aid nor all of the other people who aren't getting aid/are getting less aid because of waste, fraud and abuse. Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying there's rampant waste, fraud and abuse. There isn't. But when there is, it absolutely needs punishment as this is breaking the social contract.    That's ruining this lady's life over a couple twenties that she might have needed to pay the rent.   First of all, we don't know that. However, if she is having issues paying the rent, that's what emergency aid is for. Furthermore, eviction is a long process and it's not like failure to pay will make her end up on the streets tomorrow. As a tenant, she has plenty of redress and an eviction means she can appear in court to challenge it and even get legal aid to do so.  While your assumption is plausible, it's highly unlikely."
Maine,3d0ov7,smacksaw,3,Sun Jul 12 17:54:08 2015 UTC,"Sure sure, but I guess I feel that a $2000 fine and jail time are a disproportionately large penalty for a few dollars of welfare abuse. There should be some penalty, absolutely, but this feels particularly harsh to me, and the kind of penalty that will put this person who is already in need of assistance much, much deeper into a hole that she may never be able get out of. It's the kind of penalty that ensures that she will need more state assistance in the future, not less.  (Remember too that this isn't fraud: she was allowed to buy these items with her foodstamps, and then had the right to do what she pleases with them. At most it was abuse, but not fraud.)"
Maine,3d0ov7,octaviusromulus,3,Sun Jul 12 18:14:36 2015 UTC,"What about removing her eligibility for state and local aid in every form, for 10 years? No penalty, no jail, just avoid the risk of her wasting more money?"

If you rob a bank for $500 to pay your rent and get caught, they don't just ask for the $500 back and send you on your way. What she did was unethical, and if she is found guilty, certainly deserves to be punished"

Maine,3d0ov7,swintec,3,Sun Jul 12 23:55:37 2015 UTC,"The problem with the pictures is that family members, and sometimes people like caseworkers or agency staff can be allowed to use the card.

Because as you mentioned, these weren't purchases necessarily at strip clubs and liquor stores, they were just using the ATM there, which does seem suspicious until you realize that in poor urban areas those are often the only places where there are ATMs. And even using this broad, circumstantial definition, they still found hardly any instances of misuse of benefits. But every couple years there's a newspaper article of someone cheating the state out of dozens of dollars. And that obviously means more than empirical data."

You honestly think that an individual has to go to PTs showclub while in westbrook to find a working ATM?  Once the cash is taken off the card how the heck do you think they are going to track the misuse of benefits then?  the cash is gone and being spent .  the tracking stops at the atm."

Maine,3d3fds,tnk207,2,Wed Jul 15 22:31:15 2015 UTC,"My husband and I have been on this same quest and the results have been disappointing. Ever since the ACA, I've been trying to take care of all my heath issues left unattended due to not being able to afford health insurance. I've been shocked by just how uninformed and unprepared most doctors are to address LGBT+ health issues.   My husband and I currently have appointments with the nurse practitioner at Wildwood Health Center on India St. in Portland. She has a reputation for having some understanding of our health issues.   Other than that, calling and asking is kind of your only option/best bet but it is an incredibly awkward, disheartening and sometimes infuriating experience. The receptionists are, at best, clueless about what you mean when you say 'LGBT+ health concerns' or 'gay male health issues.' They will tell you their doctors are all fine to handle such things, but you will go in and the doctor will tell you he knows nothing about Truvada and he won't prescribe it to you until he learns more (which he will never take the time to do). At worst they are hostile, condescending or grossed out. I have had some truly dehumanizing conversations with medical health professionals in this process.   I know multiple gay men who are on an insurance plan that allows them to make use of Fenway Health - which is a practice dedicated to LGBT+ health - down in Boston. It's a bit of a haul, but if you're young and reasonably healthy, just in need of a physical every couple years and specialists for the rest, you could make use of Fenway for your PCP, Planned Parenthood (the one in Portland is fantastic) for regular screenings, etc. and local specialists for anything else.   Good luck. If you find anything/anyone promising, please hit me up. I'd love to know more."

Maine,3d3fds,Guygan,6,Mon Jul 13 07:22:54 2015 UTC,"Well it certainly gives you special concerns. Gay males are at a higher risk for HIV and other STDs, and because of this LGBT folks are sometimes encouraged to take certain preventative measures such as PrEP.

Maine,3d1cqd,Guygan,2,Mon Jul 13 01:02:53 2015 UTC,Thanks. That was one of my concerns. I know the bigger ones do and may have to resort to eel traps to get any decent volume. I was basically hoping there was enough by catch that over say 1 week I could get a decent amount.

They're kind of too small, separating the meat is too miserable, etc. There has been some interest in eating them when they've molted, but unlike blue crabs there isn't an indication when they're about to molt.  It's too bad because the margins on human food are much larger than any other use I've seen."

Maine,3cxy1j,Simonov,7,Sat Jul 11 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, but you can't really underestimate the American people's general distaste for Hillary. Now as in 2008 she's the front runner primarily because people recognize her name - not because anybody actually thinks she would make a great president. In 2008 Obama came on the scene and the Democratic voter base breathed a heavy sigh of relief that they weren't going to get stuck with Hillary. Personally I think Hillary will probably get the nomination, but doesn't stand a chance in the general election unless the Republicans nominate Trump or some other complete jackass. Nominating Hillary would be a perfect recipe for Democratic voter apathy."

Maine,3cxy1j,unitedstatesofganja,3,Sun Jul 12 03:52:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of people say ""I like Bernie, but I don't think he can win"", and the media just keep echoing ""he's popular, but Hillary has nothing to worry about"".  I disagree.  Bernie is being VERY disruptive right now, and we're very early in the process.  Everyone I've met who takes the time to listen to what he has to say comes out on the other side feeling reinvigorated and optimistic about finding a politician who isn't... well, bullshit.  I started donating to Bernie the day he announced and he's my first choice.  I don't think Hillary can win the general election, she has too much baggage at this point.  Bernie has the best chance of getting out the youth vote, which I think will simply not show up to vote for an establishment candidate.  Electability aside, Bernie is the first politician who has lined up with my personal political views pretty much across the board.  He is refreshingly intelligent, authentic, and is the only politician who has the balls to stand against the corruption of money in politics.  Bernie is the real deal, and he's a fighter."
Maine,3cxy1j,soucy,2,Sun Jul 12 10:01:50 2015 UTC,"When he spoke about several issues, he would talk about ""Vermont and Maine,"" suggesting to the audience that he was a New England candidate (presumably opposed to a Wall Street or west coast candidate).  Of course I didn't hear his speech in Wisconsin or Colorado, so maybe he talks about ""Vermont and X"" everywhere.  The two lines in the speech which got the most applause were - Defense of contraception access and abortion rights and - The moral imperative of action on global climate change. I found that interesting because I don't normally think of Bernie Sanders in relation to those issues.  I suppose it is more a reflection of the audience.  He persuasively argued that Americans need a vacation -- that they work too hard, and they are exhausted.  His policy solution was two weeks of paid vacation for all workers...  Maybe that's a realistic thing which can be achieved, but it was a little bit of let down."

Maine,3cxgcf,JfromGallifrey,6,Sat Jul 11 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"If you're looking to buy a house look for one that has a wood or pellet stove in it. That will cut your heating bill by a good amount. It saves me roughly $2500 a year.  What do you do for work? Outside the Portland area the main category for employment is probably health care.  As for your truck, I would probably sell it in Oklahoma. There isn't a huge demand for 2wd pickups here. A front wheel drive car would serve you better in a snow storm than your truck would.  The further north you go the cheaper real estate gets."
Maine,3cxgcf,Snotrockett,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:18:25 2015 UTC,"I'm going to school for nursing. Currently, I work at Olive Garden and planned to transfer to their Bangor location. I know money will be tight for a while, but after a year or so of living in Maine I'd like to try to continue my education and work toward my RN. Probably get my LPN through a tech school somewhere just for a higher income while going to school. My purpose of moving is just to be closer to my best friend and get out of Oklahoma. I'm sure things would be easier if I waited a few years, but I feel like that's where I need to be right now.  I won't be looking to buy a house until I'm more settled and make more money. As for the vehicle, I'm still making payments and bought the truck from my dad just a few months ago. I'd like to hang onto it for the next year if possible, just because I know my dad went down on the price so much for me, I'd feel like a jerk if I just turned around and sold it to get  something else and without it I have nothing."
Maine,3cxgcf,mushpuppy,3,Sun Jul 12 05:45:34 2015 UTC,"Working as an RN in Maine probably would be a great way to live, because it would be steady work which paid decently.  However, I strongly would suggest that you apply/get accepted to nursing school there first.  There just are not a lot of jobs--at least not which pay enough for you to get yourself going financially.  It is a challenging market simply because of the lack of people.  Honestly it would be worth the wait to prepare yourself properly for this.  It's a big move from OK.   Maine is simply lovely; but it's also challenging for a lot of reasons.  Jobs are one.  Another is the winters.  The snow does get very deep and the winter does fall and stay below 0 for a long time.  In the fall you'll want to winterize your car.  Just take it to a shop and ask them to do it.    As for driving, you learn to go slow and to stop by tapping brakes repeatedly.  I didn't have that much trouble learning how to drive there.  You'd want a heavy heavy coat--not something like what they'd consider heavy in OK.  You'd want heavy sweaters, snow socks, heavy duty snow boots.  Also almost certainly long-johns, top and bottom.  And warm, water-proof gloves.  As far as where to live, there are lots of little towns around Bangor where you can look--Orono (more expensive than others b/c of U Maine), Old Town, Brewer.  Also, there are roommate situations available--you can check the Bangor Daily and, if you got into school, the school's housing office (I forget what it's called).  Assuming you kept your truck, it could be advantageous to sell it up there.  Southern cars can warrant a premium; the idea is that if it was driven mostly in the south it won't have any under-carriage damage from salt.  In any event, whatever you decide, good luck."
Maine,3cxgcf,Snotrockett,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:16:57 2015 UTC,"My wife, mother, mother in law, brothers wife, and brothers mother in law are all RNs. I'm probably leaving someone out...  A lot of hospital organizations up here will pay for you to go to nursing school in one way or another. Whether through grants or loan forgiveness etc etc.  You could wait tables anywhere really. My wife and sister in law both attended the Universtity of Maine at Augusta and did a good chunk of their schooling from home. I think they both traveled there a couple times a week for a few years.  Your LPN license is essentially useless unless you're working at a Veterans hospital for some reason. Most other nursing jobs are going to want you to have your RN."
Maine,3cxgcf,nswizdum,5,Sun Jul 12 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"If thats a full size F-150, you're going to have a bad time. I usually put about 300lbs of sand in the bed, and I still have to engage my 4WD a lot. I live in Bangor though, so most of the problem is the roads not being plowed until 4PM.    EDIT: Also, where you said you don't have a lot of experience in snow, you should head to an empty parking lot after it snows, and just practice driving. Try to get a feel for when the wheels are about to break traction with the road surface, test stopping distance, ABS, those sorts of things. The number one biggest mistake people make is underestimating braking distance. 4WD and traction control help you get up to 45MPH in the snow, but they don't help you stop when the light turns red in front of you. I have seen so many people skid sideways through intersections."
Maine,3cxgcf,Mooseghanistan,3,Sat Jul 11 19:56:52 2015 UTC,"Also drive an F150, any full size 2WD truck is going to have a shitty time in New England.   I'd say sell that truck there where there's a market for it and use the funds to buy something more appropriate for the climate here."

Maine,3cxgcf,111ridges,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:46:04 2015 UTC,Protip that many people don't know: ABS does not work on ice; you should still pump the brakes in winter.
Maine,3cxgcf,sirgoofs,4,Mon Jul 13 16:54:19 2015 UTC,"Moved here 3 yrs ago and live 30 miles south of Portland. You need at least a front wheel drive vehicle. I own a small house and use pellet stoves with a wood stove so heating bills aren't bad. Heating oil prices are down at the moment as well. Electric costs depends on the utility co. Seasons are distinct and somewhat even. When it gets cold it stays. However the spring and summer is glorious, like an endless spring if your from the midwest. Its overall more expensive to live here but its a slower life style. And without an education, job skill, or trade, wages are not good."
Maine,3cxgcf,giantslor,3,Sat Jul 11 18:21:08 2015 UTC,"Don't panic about the truck. Just put good snow tires on it, (studded tires if possible), and keep 500lbs of sand or rocks in the back, right over the axle.  Edit- I've made it through plenty of winters with a 2wd F150, you just have to drive conservatively and avoid deep snow and hills when the conditions are poor."
Maine,3cxgcf,injulen,3,Sun Jul 12 11:04:29 2015 UTC,"Put a bunch of weight in the bed and drive slow... that's about all you'll have to do. Don't listen to the people who tell you that you'll need FWD or 4WD, they've clearly never beheld the glory of the Ford F series."
Maine,3cxgcf,injulen,3,Sat Jul 11 19:53:20 2015 UTC,"As others have said, a little weight in the bed of the truck goes a long way. The other thing you can do to really help a TON is to get actual snow tires. They'll let you handle better, stop better, and accelerate without spinning your wheels.   As far as heating costs, that is hugely dependent on the rental you have. The insulation, amount of windows, sun exposure, type of fuel for the heating system, and the actual heating system itself will all play major roles in factoring your cost."

Also the Desert of Maine, also in Freeport,!is a super cool place. It's literally just a desert though  but also offers some (Im assuming easy as I've never been on them) walking trails. Again, kids loved it.   And if you like Italian try The Great Impasta on Maine st in Brunswick. There's a bunch of decent little sandwich spots on Maine st, but they typically close relatively early. Also if you're in the mood for bbq beale st bbq in bath is delicious and there are also some trails at the north end of high st in Bath, I can't say I've been too far out there though so I don't really know what they have to offer, but hopefully these get you started on finding some fun stuff to do!"

Close by is the famous Five Islands Lobster. If you are feeling ambitious you could also go to Popham Beach.  In my top 3 beaches out of the hundred-ish I've visited.  Near there is a wonderful little farm restaurant.  North Creek farm.  Great soups and sandwiches you eat outside with the chickens surrounded by flowers. At Boothbay there is a boat ride to Cabbage Island with a clam bake.  I havent done it but people like it. (A bit pricey tho I think) Do the botanical garden.  It's beautiful.  .

Maine,3cpcia,sylban,-1,Fri Jul 10 06:08:37 2015 UTC,"Yup he should have been in there every single day re-connecting the  fire alarms disabled by smokers! You've got to be joking, renters have a responsibility to keep their own space safe and not throw lit cigarettes around. What would you have done to stop the tenant from lighting the place on fire?"
Maine,3cpcia,russianpotato,7,Fri Jul 10 11:52:17 2015 UTC,"You seem to be focusing on one tiny detail out of many. The landlord is in fact being charged for selling rooms on the third floor, which was not code-compliant, and making apparently no effort to maintain any building safety."
Maine,3cpcia,sylban,0,Fri Jul 10 11:54:59 2015 UTC,"Actually I read most of the documents publicly available, as well as the sworn statements of witnesses.  The cause of the fire wasn't any of the code issues, or the fact that he was selling rooms on the third floor. It was a lit cigarette, thrown on a porch which no amount of compliance can help.  ""The smoke detectors had been disabled, he said. The front door was left open, allowing the fire to spread quickly inside the house and block the front doorway.""  These are not things Nisbet could have stopped.  You can't stop tenants from disconnecting even hard wired smoke detectors so that they can smoke and cook inside. It was a tragedy and people like you can't accept that sometimes things bad things happen and it is a confluence of events not some criminal mastermind who must be punished."
Maine,3cpcia,russianpotato,4,Fri Jul 10 12:14:43 2015 UTC,"You're speculating wildly about what the charges will be. That has not been announced yet.  I've done some stuff in landlord-tenant and code issues. The landlord probably cannot be held responsible for tenant conduct, unless he knew about it and had ample opportunity to act on it. So that's almost certainly not going to be what the charges will be.  The charges will very likely be for making it possible and likely that something like this would eventually happen. You might have noticed at some point that incidents like this are rare. That's because most landlords aren't this negligent, careless, and criminal. (Selling rooms on the hard-to-escape third floor was absolutely forbidden by law, but he did it anyway.) Or do you suppose that this is the only apartment building in Maine with shitty tenants?"
Maine,3cpcia,sylban,-2,Fri Jul 10 12:24:09 2015 UTC,"A working fire detector on the first floor could have given people ample time to escape the 3rd floor, so that is on the tenants disconnecting them. This is a tragedy for all involved, but an egress window (on the third floor) doesn't help people who die in their sleep from smoke inhalation because there are no alarms going off.  Sure he was a slumlord, but those deaths are not on his hands, if anything blame whomever disconnected those smoke detectors, and the person that took the cigarette butt disposal post apart instead of emptying it.  Like I said there are many factors that had to go wrong for this to happen, most of which Nisbet had no control over."
Maine,3cpcia,russianpotato,3,Fri Jul 10 12:39:43 2015 UTC,"First, it's not for you to decide if the third floor is compliant or not, nor is it for the landlord to decide that. Your speculation might contribute to a worthwhile discussion about the broader issues, but it's legally meaningless. The landlord knowingly violated code. That's what's legally meaningful.  Second, based on your personal and legally meaningless feelings, you have no place whatsoever declaring what the landlord is or is not liable for. Generally speaking, unless some unexpected mitigating details emerge, the landlord will be charged and quite likely found guilty for knowingly violating codes specifically designed to avoid incidents like this. Those codes work when they're followed, as the dearth of such incidents proves. Your armchair analysis about all that has pretty much no meaning whatsoever. You're not a code expert, you're not a safety expert, you're not a fire expert, and you're not a legal expert. The people involved in this investigation and the pending charge are; their views are vastly more meaningful than your gut feelings or whatever you think makes sense.  I don't know what you believe the point of your commentary is. What do you believe you're trying to accomplish here?"
Maine,3cpcia,sylban,-2,Fri Jul 10 12:47:20 2015 UTC,"Firstly hahahaha, this isn't a court of law! It is an internet forum, or did you not realize that? Both your armchair analysis and mine are completely meaningless in the context of this case.  You're not going to affect the outcome, nor am I.  I'm just discussing my thoughts on the issue, and I though you were doing the same, but clearly you're cracked about this case for some reason, so have at it legal eagle!  Do you have some authority issues? Of course I'm not ""deciding"" what constitutes a code violation (of which there were clearly many). I simply postulated that perhaps the code violations did not directly contribute to the tragedy that took place."

Localized, not that bad. Biddeford is actually pretty large compared to the downtown area (which is up and coming in some respects in my opinion, with the work going into the mills). The areas outside of downtown range from okay to actually very nice. The pills stuff is a bit over-hyped in my opinion, it tends to stay low key. You really only run into if you look for it sort of scenario. I don't think I've ever really felt unsafe there, and used to regularly drink/hangout in the downtown area.  My concern with it would be the school system. Bad superintendent, obnoxious school board, lots of people with small minds and outdated ideas, little funding.  That being said, OOB is probably not the way to go either. Huge tourist population, so it is basically dead in the winter, and again, stagnating school system.  If you want to stay on the I95-I295 corridor (places with an exit basically), PARTS of South Portland are nice, Falmouth is good, Cumberland is nice, Yarmouth has one of the best school systems in the state, Scarborough is good, and Saco is nice if you stay away from the areas close to the river."

For the first 3 years my gf and I lived downtown in an apartment, and about a year ago we bought a house in a fine middle class neighborhood.  We have great food here, the beach is awesome, and it's good access to places both north and south.  I'm pretty open minded in general, so I don't mind the sketchier people or the occasional homeless.  I do avoid the 711 at all costs though.  We've lived out of state before, and Biddeford is absolutely tame compared to real cities in this country.  I'm always amused to hear what people have to say about the city.  It's mostly middle aged to elderly folks in my neighborhood, and they are all fantastic people."

I own a nice place at a decent price. They exist. The proximity to Portland is nice, the housing is cheaper than Portland/Scarborough, and between Saco/Biddeofrd, everything you need is here.   if you have a particular place in mind, feel free to PM me, and I'll swing by and check it out for you, let you know what the neighborhood is like.  I'm in the HS all the time down here and thats the worst part of the school system, but it has been getting a lot better lately. I still think its garbage, but thats for professional reasons.   The elementary school is actually pretty nice.  And no, its not so much a pill popping town. There are some weird folk walking around, but you're going to get that anywhere you go.  Edit to not seem like a snob"

I lived in Biddeford until I was four (my dad was born and raised there), and the majority of my friends growing up lived in the Biddeford/Saco area.  St. James School is a reasonably-priced private school that's a solid alternative to Biddeford public schools. You don't have to be Catholic to go there--most of my friends from childhood were educated there."
Maine,3cp0vu,348D,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:41:57 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call St. James a good school, but it's at least a little better than the Biddeford public schools. Saco public schools are much better."

It's a local place that avoids the hipster pitfalls of Portland, the wigger pitfalls of Lewiston, the welfare pitfalls of Augusta, the hard drug pitfalls of Bangor, and the tourist pitfalls of the entire coast.

Maine,3cp0vu,muthermcree,2,Thu Jul 9 23:53:18 2015 UTC,"Everything that's been said about downtown Biddeford here could easily be said about the downtown of any decent sized city in Maine. I wouldn't want to raise a family right in town, but get even a 1/2 mile from the Police station, and I think you'll find nothing to be concerned about.  Same thing goes for parts of Saco, Westbrook, Portland, Augusta, etc.  There are 'bad' neighborhoods everywhere, but it's Maine - bad is relative.  North of Portland is (generally speaking) going to be more expensive - Cumberland/Falmouth/Freeport are nice, but your rent won't go nearly as far.  My mortgage on a nice house is less than some of my coworkers pay for rent in Portland.  Bonus for the Saco/Biddeford area - there's a great commuter bus that runs up to Portland, so on those days you do need to head into the city, you can leave your cart at the Park n Ride.  (I grew up in the Saco/Biddeford area, have lived all over, and currently live back in Biddeford)"
Maine,3cp0vu,ebenhall,2,Thu Jul 9 20:52:25 2015 UTC,"Biddeford isn't necessarily bad, but it's not good, and the schools there (and OOB) are notoriously bad. If you want to be within an hour of Portland, and have some access to cool beaches, try Bath. I've lived here 6 years, with 2 young kids, and we love it. It can be a little slow, but it's getting better. And Portland is 40 minutes. Brunswick is only 10, that's a college town with a lot of culture."
Maine,3cp0vu,ebenhall,2,Thu Jul 9 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"Don't discount Bath so quickly! I'm born and raised there and go back several times a year to visit the folks. Wonderful, friendly Maine vibe - not downtrodden, but not too many tourists either. Lots of new restaurants and businesses going in there. Same with Brunswick a town over - it's seriously a midcoast renaissance there right now. 15 minutes to Freeport, 30m to Portland. It's great."
Maine,3cp0vu,iago1600,2,Thu Jul 9 23:40:00 2015 UTC,Atlantic Townhomes   And by the way Atlantic Townhouse is arguably in the sketchiest part of Bath. Look closer to downtown.

Maine,3cp0vu,xxXICONXxx,2,Fri Jul 10 11:30:23 2015 UTC,"I would recommend Biddeford. There are really only a few blocks downtown I'd avoid, pretty much anything off of bacon st or elm street. Everything else is pretty nice and the schools aren't bad if you have kids. I grew up in Saco and we always made fun of Biddeford but to be honest, I lived in Philly for the past few years and Biddeford is the garden of eden compared to what I felt with there"

My main complaint about Biddeford is property taxes, but the high tax burden doesn't seem to be reflected in the rents, so if you're looking to rent, it's not something I'd worry about."

Wish I was still here but jobs took me out of State. Biddeford has come a long way since I was young. There is a brewery here, a nice downtown, good food, ocean. There are really quiet areas to settle down in. I don't have much to compare to, but I liked coming through the school system. There are areas that are worse than others but I've been in some really bad areas in Boston and the bad areas in Biddeford make me laugh now."

I still go to the businesses in the downtown area but that is such a small part of Biddeford. I believe the nicer areas of Biddo outweigh the bad areas. When I went through the school system there were some sketchy looking kids but as long as you're not quick to judge everyone was really nice.

Maine,3clwy2,soucy,8,Thu Jul 9 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"Gun control is an emotional issue, and each time the topic of gun violence comes up people always push for more restrictions on gun ownership.    The problem is that this is an emotional reaction that isn't based on the facts.  In the majority of situations, gun control laws have no effect on the preventing the issue of the moment (schools shootings, domestic terrorism, etc) that everyone is worked up about.  Determined people will either find a way to get access to firearms OR find alternatives (very easy to make a bomb, for example).  Urban areas specifically push for tight gun control in response to the problem of gang violence.  If anyone actually thinks gangs are going to care about the law, they're an idiot, though.  But, people are sheep, and afraid, and need to feel safe, so they support giving up personal freedom in exchange for the promise of more security.  As a liberal, I've always felt the gun issue is one that has been tremendously harmful to building support for progressive politics and is just a distraction that allows conservatives to point the finger and cry foul.  I'm not sure when stripping liberty became a liberal issue, but we need to stop pushing for gun control the same way conservatives need to stop pushing for abortion bans.  There are real issues that need attention, and gun control is not one of them.  This is why you see even Bernie Sanders make statements like ""99.9 percent of gun owners obey the law"".  There are already enough laws that apply to the use of firearms to deter people from pulling a gun on each other.  If you want to stop shootings, focus on the cause, like social injustice, education, and mental health issues.  The founding fathers lived through government oppression in a time when people were controlled and weapons were kept out of reach.  Be it to maintain the ability to defend your person or property if the government is unable, or to defend yourself against a government that has fallen to tyranny; the 2nd amendment is just as fundamental to the constitution as the 1st, and exists to ensure the people always have the power to defend themselves.    Current times obviously don't call for us to invoke this right often, especially if you're white, but it would be shortsighted of us to strip this right for future generations, especially in a time where we see increasing levels of corruption in government, and the stripping of basic rights in the name of fighting terrorism (being spied upon, held without due process, unjustly incarcerated over petty charges, tortured, or even killed by law enforcement)."

Stupid, yes, but nobody to blame but him."
Maine,3clwy2,binary_digit,2,Thu Jul 9 12:21:39 2015 UTC,"The stupid one is him. Imagine if he visited Portland ....   Lets not imagine some what-if scenario.  Instead, lets talk about what actually happened.     Michael Smith went outside shirtless after being awakened Tuesday morning, yelling at a tree removal company to get off his property.  The workers thought they saw a gun in his waistband and called police.   Is it a crime to yell at people to get off your property?  Is it a crime to have a gun in your waistband on your own property?  I believe the answer to both questions is no.  Please correct me if I'm wrong....   Smith, who works nights, said he was still asleep and was surprised to see a crew of workers from Lucas Tree Experts preparing to saw a number of trees around some power lines on his property.  Wearing just a pair of pants and no shirt, though the temperature was in the teens, he went outside and asked them to leave.  The tree removal company workers reported that as they backed into the driveway, Smith told them not to cut the trees. They told him it was not a problem.  Smith went back to bed; but as the workers were leaving, one thought he saw a pistol in Smith’s waistband.      Smith, who’d gone back to bed, was awakened again minutes later — this time by Maine State Police at his front door, backed up by a group of troopers with assault rifles in his driveway. They were asking him via a megaphone to come out of his house.      “They weren’t 100 percent sure what he was saying,” Duff (the Maine State Trooper interviewed for the story) said, “but he was yelling and they thought it could be some sort of a threat. They thought he was yelling something to the effect of doing harm, but when we got a hold of him, it ended up just being a tattoo.”  It was all just a misunderstanding, both Smith and police said.   We see stories like this over and over, where someone calls the Police to report a ""crime"" that isn't a crime.  Thankfully this time nobody died, but there are a lot of examples where things ended a lot worse.  I just can't understand your viewpoint.  Why do you chose to heap scorn on the person who was exercising his rights?  Why aren't we heaping scorn on the people who called the police when no crime was being committed?  Why aren't we heaping scorn on the police who should now when a police response is required, and when it isn't?   “They weren’t 100 percent sure what he was saying, but he was yelling and they thought it could be some sort of a threat."

All this changes is people that already have permits won't have to renew and others that are waiting for ones or were considering getting one may start to carry if they feel the need.

If you wanna post somewhere else, the Mainely Subarus facebook group is full of people who need 93 for their tuned cars, most of them live in the souther portion of the state, but they generally know where to get it elsewhere.

Maine,3co7ew,asininedervish,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:49:05 2015 UTC,My volvo was always run with 87 octane.  When I got it I switched it to 91 like the manual suggests and I instantly saw a fuel mileage increase of about 3 MPG.  Cost wise it is not quite a wash with this increase but the benefits i think help to make it just about a no brainer.  The independent volvo mechanic also has engine parts on display that have been run on 87 all their life versus 91 and the difference in deposits gunked up and down the 87 octane version is night and day.  I am certainly no mechanic but the car itself performs better on the 91/93. I would never bother to put it in my pickup though.
Maine,3co7ew,the_wookie_of_maine,0,Fri Jul 10 16:46:58 2015 UTC,"That is for people who are just driving. Performance cars it matters a ton, and has a serious difference."
Maine,3co7ew,asininedervish,-2,Fri Jul 10 01:27:30 2015 UTC,"Unless you are going over 120mph you really won't notice too much of a difference.  You will not damage your car.  The gas is all shipped up one pipe from the southern states that produce it, then it's cleaned/diluted/additives added at the end distribution farms/plant (think Portland tank farms), where it's carried to the end gas station in 1 vehicle (although I generally see 2 or 3 spouts under a tanker truck, the lines are not color coded, nor different dimensions, meaning the pipes are interchangeable, potentially meaning the goods inside are interchangeable.)....and offloaded by a Truck driver.    I drive roughly 50k miles per year.    Lexus es300, from 2003.  I put in 89.   The car has over 180k on it (and it's a 2004 we bought it used), the manual says to use 91 or higher.  The Lexus is not a 'performance' car, but the manual strongly suggests premium fuel."
Maine,3co7ew,injulen,4,Fri Jul 10 03:42:50 2015 UTC,"You're using a luxury car for commuting - with a stock tune. Manufacturers don't tune their car's aggressively enough to get damaged with normal gas, and you don't use the vehicle in such a way that would make the difference noticeable. If you were to put your vehicle on a dyno, you might get 160hp on 91 octane, but 145 on 87. This is because your ECU adapts to the lower quality fuel, but there is a cost. You just don't notice it in your usage.  You most certainly can destroy a motor in a performance vehicle with lower-octane fuel than it's rated for. You will get premature detonation to such a degree that you can wreck the internals and bottom end.  The OP is looking at a small engine, running high amounts of boost to generate serious power. Running good amounts of boost results in an extremely high-compression environment, and you need to ensure that the fuel/air mixture detonates at the proper time, with the proper mixture in order to keep that level of performance. He's probably not going to have a stock ""safe"" tune either, because those leave an easy 10% of your potential power unavailable due to the tune.  This is probably waay to long for a comment, but whatevs.  TL;DR - Performance tuned motors require it to not go boom, cars that are stock can use crappy gas."

York is just obnoxiously expensive and there is very, very little housing available.    One option you have is moving into a fully furnished winter rental while you put most of your stuff in storage and look for a permanent option.  If you can wait till Sept you can get into some absolutely spectacular oceanfront places from Sept-May for quite cheap. That would give you some time to look if you really need to get south for work, and you could plug into the town a bit and look for a permanent solution in the mean time."

However what few places I've seen listed in advance as a ""winter rental"" that were furnished, they're no cheaper than year-long rentals.  Most of them were smaller and more expensive than the $1600/mo we pay now.  Maybe that's the case in other towns but not from what I've seen in York.

Maine,3ckjpr,bleahdeebleah,8,Wed Jul 8 17:04:55 2015 UTC,"I have tried to make complete sense of state law on this, but I admit defeat.  For anyone braver or more savvy, the constitutional provisions are found at Article IV, Part 3, Section 2. The relevant language:   If the bill or resolution shall not be returned by the Governor within 10 days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to the Governor, it shall have the same force and effect as if the Governor had signed it unless the Legislature by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall have such force and effect, unless returned within 3 days after the next meeting of the same Legislature which enacted the bill or resolution; if there is no such next meeting of the Legislature which enacted the bill or resolution, the bill or resolution shall not be a law.   It looks to me as if the governor's attempt at pocket veto fails because the legislature has not formally closed the current session, but I'm very unclear on the exact parliamentary niceties here, and I'm clearly not the only one.  I think the governor got tired of having his vetoes overturned, and decided to try something different, but out-clevered himself.  Regardless of what the law actually provides, if there's a dispute, it will probably have to be sorted out in court. The theatre never ends, it seems."

Maine,3ckjpr,jotch,2,Wed Jul 8 20:18:54 2015 UTC,"Kind of looks like the constitutional language was intended to just prevent the legislature from passing something, then quickly adjourning to keep a veto from being ""completed"" by having it returned to the legislature.

Maine,3cj5jt,mainegreen,4,Wed Jul 8 13:36:29 2015 UTC,I also want to point out that over twelve years ago I was between jobs and took an entry level position at a company in South Portland that started at $10.50/hr.
Maine,3cj5jt,Johnhaven,3,Wed Jul 8 14:11:57 2015 UTC,"My first job paid $5.50/hr. in 1983. That's a bit over $13/hr. in inflation-adjusted dollars. (I lucked out--that was a great paying job.)  In 1983, you could get a new house for ~$90k. A gallon of gas was around $1.25--sometimes below a buck. A dozen eggs cost $.86, and the median household income was around $20k/year."

The law doesn't scale up the ""veterans"" pay, so the responsibility falls on the business to make sure you keep your experienced staff content. If you don't scale their rates accordingly then your run the risk of animosity leading them to ""start over"" anywhere they choose since they will be guaranteed to slide in at the same $10 they were getting paid.  It could have an effect on surrounding towns as well... Any unskilled laborer able to make the commute would obviously prefer to get hired in Portland and will try to avoid the other nearby towns that only pay the nationwide minimum. Why work 40 hours a week when you can work at the Portland McD's and make the same amount in 30 hours? Will surrounding areas need to bump up their base hire rate, just to lure in anyone?"

Envy over pay rates can hurt the bottom line in these kinds of industries. People aren't logical... especially when it comes to money. ""It ought to be the employer's ambition, as leader, to pay better wages than any similar line of business, and it ought to be the workman's ambition to make this possible."" It is hard to find someone with ambition in the menial service industry...  and a lot of businesses will lose some good employees in all the hubbub if they don't anticipate and adapt.   It will be a relatively short term problem as everything hits an equilibrium... but some places could be initially hit pretty hard if they lose 3 pissed off line cooks cause they are only making $2 an hour more than the retarded and stoned dishwasher. If people aren't appreciated they will say ""fuck this""... and during that period customers will be the ones impacted and in return the businesses and the employees themselves."
Maine,3cj5jt,Ninjakick666,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:52:47 2015 UTC,"If an employer is actually worried about their employees having low moral or ambition while paying them less than a livable wage they need to reassess their priorities.  The thing this argument misses is that 10 an hour is already a miserably awful wage, and if you aren't a teenager you're already going to hate your financial situation.    You aren't going to buy ambition from somebody who's spent years working for wages well below the poverty line.  You really think knowing a new hire makes as much as them is going to be the final straw for someone who's been working for years at a place and only makes $10-12 an hour?  It's almost impossible to find ambition at that rate because that rate is depressingly low to begin with.    If they're really still at 10 an hour or so after years of work they already loathe their employer and situation regardless of what a new hire makes.  If they could possibly change it they already would have."
Maine,3cj5jt,hesh582,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:36:07 2015 UTC,It's not the final straw aspect that I was contemplating... it was the fact that there will now be no financial drawbacks to quitting and starting over.

Maine,3cj5jt,wabisabigirl207,0,Wed Jul 8 14:49:44 2015 UTC,"You are right, it is going to create a ripple effect. Surrounding towns are going to have to raise wages to compete. The similar lower paying jobs in surrounding towns are going to have a very hard time keeping employees because as soon as there is a job opening, why would someone willingly earn 35% less when they could commute a few miles to a significantly higher paying job?   I think the city is going to regret their decision when this truly starts to hit the businesses that are just making it work. This change comes in the middle of winter, when tourists are nowhere to be found for 6 more months. People are going to get laid off or pushed from full-time to part-time. The city already sucks away the majority of this state's assistance program money--well just wait until an influx of citizens start coming to the city with open hands because they got pushed from 40 hours to 25 or lose their job completely so a business doesn't need to close its doors.  I am not saying a minimum wage increase is a bad thing, but at such a sharp increase, its going to make a major impact very quickly. This should have been tiered a little further out for such a steep wage increase. Yes, $7.50 an hour isn't a livable wage, neither is $10.10. But to make that leap overnight is going to hurt businesses and people in the short term. Once the poorly running businesses are filtered out and the stronger ones grow, things will get better, but I have a feeling initially there is going to be a bit of a shock and a significant increase for assistance being paid out by the city."
Maine,3cj5jt,Fenn2010,3,Wed Jul 8 17:48:20 2015 UTC,Minimum wage increases are absolutely meaningless without tax and employment law reform. Bootstrappy capitalist autocrats are just going to pass along the increased expense to the consumer while at the same time shafting those who operate their business if they can in the interest of keeping the summer home cutting costs.  Until it becomes unprofitable to treat your employees that way the only trickle down effect will continue to only be a trickle down of consequences for the middle class as a result of the drive to maximize profits collected by the bourgeoisie no matter the greater social cost.

Not that those 3 bucks really mean a lot to the waitress... but they mean a bit more to the business. After pulling down $250 from a 5 hour Saturday night shift I doubt a waitress is gonna care about an extra $15 on her paycheck next week... but that does make sure that income is easier to tax.

It would be expensive, however.  Say it's a $3.00 per hour increase in everyone's wage.  That's a much larger increase as a percent of their original wage for someone making minimum wage than someone already making 100k per year.  It scales nicely with base wage across the wage spectrum, and prevents people who would otherwise be just above new minimum (say currently making $11/hour) from feeling shafted.  Going from $11/hr to $14/hr isn't anything to sneer at either.    Note: I am not a proponent of a mandated minimum wage, increase or otherwise."

If nobody could predict this exact thing happening several years ago, they're very shortsighted.  I don't really see what it has to do with minimum wage, though. McDonald's makes more than enough money to pay their workers very well, but they choose not to, because it's not a skilled trade. It's hard, grueling work I'm sure, but just about any able-bodied person off the street can do it.  This article says more about McDonald's culture as a corporation than it does minimum wage."

Maine,3cj5jt,flyingfences,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:04:57 2015 UTC,"But the thing is that people can't live off McDonalds wages anyway.  If you were really making 7.50 before this and you were older than 18, you probably were either funded by your parents or government assistance.  10 an hour is still lower than the livable wage of 11 an hour in the portland area.  If someone is making less than that, the cost is coming from somewhere.  Either the taxpayer, their family, or the financial system when they go bankrupt - if they aren't just homeless, somebodies footing the bill.  If competition with robots depresses wages below the minimum livable wage than it doesn't much matter what the legal minimum wage is.  People have to live somehow, and if working at McDonalds is not longer economically feasible than the solution is not to figure out how to lower McDonalds wages even more.  Also it's interesting that  he brought up McDonalds, because even McDonalds realizes this: they've raised their corporate minimum wage to 10 an hour.  Walmart has announced the same thing recently.  Even these companies know that you just can't pay workers less than it costs to live in the long run."

Edit: if you think CEOs and business owners will take a pay cut to pay it's lowest workers more, you are sadly mistaken.

Maine,3cliew,skrunkle,3,Thu Jul 9 12:16:43 2015 UTC,"Why Does Maine Have Two Legalization Initiatives  People are always interested to know why Maine has two initiatives. They ask, “What was so bad about the Legalize Maine initiative that made MPP feel the need to spend all that money on a competing initiative?”  We have never received a credible answer to that question, but we thought we would go through the differences for you. We believe the differences are significant for the people of Maine. We are willing to fight for a better future and the tremendous support we are receiving tells us we are doing the right thing.  It really all boils down to major philosophical differences. Our focus is on jobs and economic development. We believe the rationale for pages and pages of onerous rules and regulations are dubious at best. Crappy Mexican marijuana has been consumed by American citizens for decades with few documented hazards to health or the general welfare.  We suspect that the real reason is the smell of money. Big business wants to invest because they see massive profit potential. A diversified market of small to medium sized businesses would cost them potential profits. By their very nature they seek to control and monopolize this economic sector through their connections with government.  Difference #1 – Who will regulate the new industry?  The question – should marijuana be regulated like alcohol? We look at the history of the alcohol industry since the days of prohibition to guide us.  What we see is the gradual elimination of all the small and medium sized distillers and breweries. Fortunately we have seen a trend toward small craft breweries in recent years and feel marijuana fits that mold.  In most states we also see a system of government regulated distributors that have a monopoly. Ever tried to buy some wine from your neighbor with a vineyard?  Marijuana is a plant, just like barley, hops and other grains. In flower form it requires no processing to be used as intended. Edibles are manufactured the same as food products. Seems to us the Department of Agriculture is best suited to regulate the marijuana industry.  Difference #2 – Who has final say on rules and regulations?  Once again we look to history and experience to guide us. We see time and time again situations where unelected government bureaucrats are authorized to write what are called routine technical rules.  These rules can have major consequences for local businesses, and the jobs and local taxes that are associated with them. How many times have you seen the bureaucrats hold public hearings where the majority of the testimony is negative, and then they just go ahead with what was originally proposed.  If these rules are major substantive, the rules and regulations cannot go into effect until after our elected representatives have a chance to review them or amend them. We believe our local businesses and workers should have a say in how they are regulated. We only have that say if we can communicate with our local representatives to explain why we think certain rules are bad and why.  The only downside we see in our proposal for major substantive rules is that it will delay the initial implementation until after the legislature reviews and votes on the rules that would be written by the Department of Agriculture.  Difference #3 – Local determination for retail stores  MPP proposes to limit the total number of retail stores allowed in the state. This is typical of the cookie cutter approach they use in every state they try to organize.  One of their reasons for these limits is to avoid situations where there is a weed store on every corner. Maine is different than Colorado and Washington. Our largest city is less than 100,000 people.  There is no good reason why the state government should dictate to local municipalities the number of retail marijuana stores that are allowed to operate. That is a decision that should be made on a case by case basis by the citizens and their local representatives.  We suspect that the real reason for limits on retail stores is to reduce competition so that investors can limit risk and gain higher profits.  Difference # 4 – Limits on Cultivation Capacity  There is no question as to whether production capacity will be limited when the final rules go into effect. The need to avoid over production and keep marijuana from entering the black market are key guidelines from the federal government.  The question then becomes, who do you want to set the initial production numbers? The MPP initiative requires the Bureau of Alcoholic Beverages & Lottery Operations (BABLO) to set the limit under routine technical rules.  Once again we look to history and experience to guide us. If you examine similar situations in industry segments across the country over the years you see a pattern.  The investors looking to cash in always want to limit their risk and create as much of a monopoly situation as they can get away with.  What happens is a lot of money is spent on lobbying to have rules that benefit the investors. These rules would restrict production to create a shortage and set high prices, coupled with a limit on the number of retail stores, of which they own a high percentage.  We have set the initial production limit to 800,000 sq ft of canopy, which includes vegetative and flowering. The Department of  Agriculture would be able to adjust that number up or down after the first year.  The 800, sq ft number was reached by looking at empirical data from Colorado and Washington. We looked at studies from federal agencies, state authorities and think tanks like Rand. Then we added the best research we could find…… our personal knowledge of the Maine market……plus 29 million visitors each year.  We estimate that the total production from 800,000 sq ft will be between 75-90,000 lbs. That is the number that we feel any committee or commission would come up with if the calculations are done impartially.  Once again, if the estimate is either high or low, the department can adjust it the next year.  Difference #5 – Home Cultivation and Possession Limits  Maine decriminalized marijuana possession a long time ago. Maine law currently states that possession of less than 2 ½ ounces of a useable amount of marijuana is a civil offense, akin to a speeding ticket, rather than a criminal offense. Medical marijuana limits are also 2 ½ ounces.  Our initiative maintains the current Maine limits. The MPP initiative limits possession to 1 ounce, which they have based on what other states are doing. MPP also believes that a 1 ounce limit is more politically viable.  What is even more troubling is that the MPP initiative would create a new crime for possession of over 1 ounce.  The MPP initiative allows you to have 6 plants in total. That includes seedlings and vegetative plants. They are just trying to be politically viable.  Our initiative allows 6 flowering plants, 6 vegetative plants and 6 seedlings. That is what makes sense for the people.  Difference # 6 – Taxes  The quickest way to ruin a new industry is to tax it to death. Too many people see marijuana as a cash cow for new government programs. We strongly oppose earmarking any marijuana tax money for specific new programs.  The people of Maine are not under-taxed. The truth is the state is having trouble paying for everything it is doing today. We think it only appropriate that a new marijuana tax should be used to help the State of Maine pay  it’s bills.  That is why we want the sales tax to go into the general fund. We think our elected representatives should decide how to spend the money.  The MPP initiative places a 10% tax on top of the current sales tax. The Legalize Maine tax is a straight 10%.  One of the things that guides us is our belief that there are more important economic benefits to the people of Maine than how much the government can collect in taxes.  The creation of hundreds of profitable small and medium sized businesses and the people they will employ are what are important. Local businesses will benefit and communities will feel better when they see some opportunity."

We have had mills here for a long time, but they have been well regulated so their sulfur dioxide output is fairly reasonable and some mills have actually gone straight out of business, so there are fewer of them.  Affordable living will not necessarily be found in Portland, though I won't say that it is impossible.  Many blue and white collar folks in Maine live some distance outside of a larger town like Portland, Lewiston/Auburn, Bangor, or along the coast in populated and often more wealthy areas.  The trick is to figure out the type of area that you want to live in and look at school districts, location in distance away from medicine, food, education, work, etc.  Housing is often expensive in the desireable areas, but many places that are located a short drive from Maine's ""dense"" populated areas are both affordable and sustain a decent standard of living.  When you decide where to live you might consider all sorts of variables, but with a little more information about what you're looking for we might be able to make suggestions.  You can take a look at the job market online through craigslist or JobsinME (I think thats the service), though I will be honest it varies from barren to full of opportunity depending on the field you particularly work in.  I know that IT is a field that I have been able to consistently find work.  If you want to do Portland, I would at least look outside of Portland to places like South Portland, Scarborough, Falmouth, Gorham, Westbrook, and perhaps Windham.

Nor are they some classicaly trained guitarist who, despite characterizing Maine as nothing but ""lighthouses and BBQ"" spams /r/maine with offers to be taught dead men's ""pieces"" on a nylon stringed bore.

Maine,3chp9r,xPersistentx,0,Wed Jul 8 11:26:08 2015 UTC,More like people don't think they'll get a return on their investment so they don't commit capital to build any processing plants
Maine,3chp9r,Reading4Jesus,3,Wed Jul 8 11:40:50 2015 UTC,"The last large push for building infrastructure was addressed only a couple years ago, but it seems the largest dealers and buyers always have a great reason to stop local government from moving forward.  Big money stays big. Cooperatives and locally resourced revenue are slowly becoming a thing of the past.  There are a number of investors as well, who've come to the state and attempted to build infrastructure. Current dealers keep them out as well.  It has nothing to do with investment. Your suggestion is actually a tad ridiculous. You're suggesting an investor would not see a return on an historically sound product with an historically high profit margin today, that is sustaining constant growth?"
Maine,3chp9r,xPersistentx,0,Wed Jul 8 18:23:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if I understand your arguments...they seem contradictory.

From your second: "" it seems the largest dealers and buyers always have a great reason to stop local government from moving forward.""   You've gone from blaming the government to blaming business in a completely contradictory fashion.   What I'm suggesting is that investors seek out the best return on investment, which isn't ridiculous in the slightest, and since there's been a dearth of investment in the processing industry, it's most likely because investors have done the math and decided to allocate their resources into investments with better returns-and less volatility. Seafood is risky and volatile-the shrimping season is closed for the second straight year now. Investors are wary of such happenings."

I'd suggest that when the wealthiest players want to stay on top, their interests and the decisions of the legislature can often align quite easily.

The lobster festival is like a mini carnival where you can eat lobster. That's the best way I can describe it. You can walk around the whole thing in about 10 minutes.  The last day (Sunday) is the best day to go. Free to get in and a lot of the fun events happen that day such as the lobster crate race.

Also, you're going to Fort Fairfield not Presque Isle, right?  Keep in mind the stretch from Houlton to Fort Fairfield is incredibly hilly.  Good luck to you and have a good trip!"
Maine,3cctiu,Kirby420_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:30:36 2015 UTC,"Google averages all biking to about 11mph. For reasons unknown to mortal man :)  I usually tour at about 13mph, road cycle at 16. Part of that's the 15 pounds of gear (which is considered ""ultralight"" among cyclotourists). But part of that's endurance - ""slow and steady"" takes on new meaning when you're riding day after day after day.  Shameless plug: r/bicycletouring"

Maine,3cc4z7,russianpotato,3,Tue Jul 7 01:03:09 2015 UTC,Wow you're an idiot.  You can't get chemical burns from eating lobster.  It is literally impossible. Take another look at your critical thinking skills.
Maine,3cc4z7,russianpotato,2,Tue Jul 7 02:45:03 2015 UTC,"So you got blisters on your hands from ingesting one lobster's worth of heavy metals? Also not how any of this works works/100% impossible....do you have a diagnosed mental condition, psychosis or paranoia?"
Maine,3cc4z7,russianpotato,2,Tue Jul 7 22:56:02 2015 UTC,"Lol, well I must be fucking superman since I was able to eat lots of lobster 3 times a week for 3 entire years while I had my rec. licence and never had heavy metal poisoning. Since blisters on the hands is not how ingested heavy metal poisoning presents you clearly have NO idea what you're talking about and made the whole thing up to justify you untenable position."
Maine,3cc4z7,DarthYak45,3,Tue Jul 7 23:14:39 2015 UTC,"Your story is a lie for so many reasons. Lobsters accumulate various pollutants PCBs, PAHs, dioxins, heavy metals in the hepatopancreas or ""tomally"" and the eggs. If you don't eat these then you can't get any heavy metals out of a lobster.  Even if you do, the amounts are much much lower than marine life higher on the food chain like Tuna. Their molt cycle also helps rid them of these pollutants with every molt, so if you are going to eat seafood the lobster is some of the safest in the world.  Lobsters have no natural life span and can theoretically live indefinitely.  You know nothing and are entirely wrong about everything you've ever ""known""."

Maine,3c77k4,r12ski,3,Sun Jul 5 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"I think we are in agreement.  However, technically speaking, research studies have ""conclusions"" or ""findings"" that may or may not be in support of a ""theory.""  Researchers will often qualify their results by statements such as, ""The findings suggest the following conclusions....""  Nothing is considered ""fact"" until it has been repeatedly confirmed in scientific studies.  The climate change and GMO arguments fit into this idea.  The climate change theory has been confirmed in study after study to the point where the vast majority of qualified scientists agree.  The GMO theories on both sides of the argument have not risen to this level in most cases.  However, that does not stop the GMO industry or the opposition from digging up often poorly done or biased research to support their beliefs.  As a rule, social science research, such as in the OP, is no-where near as rigorous as pure science, and there are typically many more questions about validity and reliability.  It's the same process, however, of seeing if a study can be objectively replicated over and over with the same findings."

To quote a Boston Globe article: 'Thick vegetation walled the trail on either side. Beyond it, precipitous cliffs dropped more than a hundred feet into caves and boulder gardens deep enough to swallow a truck. “My gosh,” Clark said to her friend, “if you were six inches off the trail here, you’d be gone.

There are white blazes everywhere, and the trail in that location is all white marked. There are yellow blazes indicating the boundary limits like 200 feet from each side of the trail.

There are plenty of civil service jobs that can be filled by people who can't otherwise find work.

We had far more than our fair share because BC was the one place where they wouldn't die off in a cold snap.  Maine is no different than Canada.  If you're faced with homelessness and limited resources and Maine gives you a terrible deal and some other state gives you a better deal, your last $30 is a greyhound ticket outta town.  There's a balance between ""if you feed them, they will come"" and a comprehensive system.  I live in Montreal. Our homeless people are either in social housing or Vancouver. I met more homeless Québécois in Vancouver than all other Québécois combined.  It's tough. And considering the state Maine is in right now, exporting problems doesn't seem like a bad idea. It's not as crass as California sending their mentally ill on one way bus tickets to Nevada, but it's the same thing and it happens when social services are overburdened.  The question is how you expand services without making them an institution or a draw. Here in Québec it's pretty depressing all of the people whose only goal in life is to be on welfare. Our system is too generous."

My whopping poverty level wages are clearly reason enough for me to strive to make Portland one giant tent city.   In regards to the ""wealthy bum"" as you so lovingly referred to a human as. What guardian? These are middle aged adults that either have no living relatives, or have not been in contact with their family in decades. These are individuals that are so unwell that they couldn't tell you their names, let alone how much money is in their bank account (or even that they have a bank account).

It was Sunday, it was raining and cold. He mumbled something to me about being homeless and trying to get to work, to what I presume was a dish washing job somewhere. He asked me for my sweatshirt. I didn't want to give him my sweatshirt but I did.   Shortly afterwords I thought about how that guy needed that sweatshirt much more than I. While I was taking it off, he was mumbling to himself constantly, he clearly had issues. People like that need help. I get sick of seeing panhandlers everywhere too, I know for some it's just an easy way to get money, but there are clearly some people that need help. Not everyone was bestowed with such wonderful mental prowess as yourself.   Who knows, maybe someday you'll get into a car accident or something and get severely brain damaged.

I have to wonder how bad things have to get where begging on the side of the road for 8 hours a day is actually a better option than a minimum-wage job.  Maybe if the cities were allowed to define their own minimum wages... nope, we can't have that."
Maine,3c0ha8,civildisobedient,3,Fri Jul 3 19:56:09 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I'm a huge advocate for a minimum living wage.  When it comes to individual cities, however, we need to realize that these cities have finite boundaries that are often very similar to what's just on the other side. Portland specifically encompasses the on-peninsula location, but also outer Forest and Congress off-peninsula, bordering SoPo and Westbrook.   While a minimum wage increase in the urban core of the Peninsula would likely not affect business downtown at all, a wage increase on the fringes of town has shown in other cities (most well documented to be Seattle) of places needing to cut hours, move facilities, and in general be a bad move for businesses on the city limits.  One dollar an hour difference will not make a huge difference, but some of the legislation calls for like 15/hr in Portland, yet Westbrook would still be at 8.50/hr. We're talking twice the cost! Does it really make sense to have that kind of patchwork minimum wage throughout the land, or simply one minimum wage per state? Although I agree that there should be a minimum wage that guarantees a living wage, it's failed to work on a city by city basis system previously and I'm concerned that doing the same in Portland would not work well."

Sorry, I don't agree that this is foregone conclusion, neither is it an apples-to-apples comparison, and think the jury is still out on whether the program has been an overall success, (however you define it).  Restaurants will most definitely cut staff.  But I disagree that this is a bad thing, even for the worker.  I've worked in a restaurant where we received no base pay--just tips.  The cheaper it is for the restaurant to have waiters on the floor the more they'll bring in just to cover their bases.  But the more waiters that are working, the less tables you serve, the less tips you bring in--ultimately, the less wages you're bringing home.  Did the management care?  Of course not, they could simply get anyone off the street to replace you.  The more expensive it is to staff--a $15/hr. wage, for instance--the more inclined the restaurant is to only have as many people as they absolutely need to operate.  But that means the waiters that are able to keep their jobs get a real, living salary.  Naturally, that doesn't mean everyone will get a living salary, just because a lot more people are going to have to compete.  Now the restaurant is forced to care about the employee.  If they're good or not.  If they pay attention, if they don't forget orders--these are the things you want from a waiter, and this incentivizes that behavior.  So I would take issue with claiming the consequence of higher minimum wages will just naturally result in a worse result for the workforce."

You can yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater all you like. That phrase comes from a dictum on an incorrectly decided case relating to WW1 leaflets. The Court wrongly held that a person couldn't put out leaflets opposing the draft. Holmes then wrote non-binding musings about yelling fire in a theater. That case was overturned 40 years later. You absolutely can yell ""fire"" in a theater. The specific standard for speech which is not free speech is that a reasonable person must understand the speech to be likely to incite immediate lawless action and it must actually cause lawless action. Yelling ""fire"" in a theater is likely to cause people to exit a building. Exiting a building is not illegal.   http://popehat.com/2012/09/19/three-generations-of-a-hackneyed-apologia-for-censorship-are-enough/"

Maine,3bpmqs,Tacoloco23,18,Wed Jul 1 03:26:14 2015 UTC,"Back when Mardens was just the Lewiston store it was a lot of fun to explore. You never knew what you would find in there. They would basically buy a truckload of random things, usually UPS or FedEx lost shipments, and then attempt to find a place in the store for them. Pricing was...confusing... to say the least. Without the widespread internet, there was no way to get a base to sell this stuff.  One of my favorite stories happened to a friend of my fathers. He was walking through the basement hardware area and saw a pallet with an interesting piece of machined metal on it. They were asking close to $200 for it, so it was above what most people at a salvage store would pay for something random. My fathers friend realized that it may be part of a plane, and he had some extra money so he took the gamble.  It turned out to be an integral part of the landing gear from a Lear jet. It was worth somewhere close to $40,000 used.  He had friends at Portland airport. It did not take him long to be laughing all the way to the bank.  Now, Mardens has so many stores they are trying to fill that they have to search out the much bigger lots. Plus, the pricers have access to the internet and seem to look for higher retail prices, no matter the source, to base their pricing from."

That doesn't change the fact that if you are taking something for free, that is meant to be paid for, you are stealing said thing. Be it bricks & mortar or 0's & 1's, you are still taking the fruits of someone else's labor without compensating them.

It would be best if Republican senators Saviello and Katz are able to get a non-partisan investigation of the charges underway so that all the facts are laid on the table before the Democrats start screaming for blood.

Maine,3bl8jl,Soulthriller,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:29:29 2015 UTC,"Why do you think Baxter State Park isn't a real park?  There are a number of reasons for which people saw they oppose the national park. Many people don't trust the federal govt to begin with. Then, they think a national park would harm the state’s forest products industries. There's a belief most of the jobs created would be low-paid seasonal, And some say the National Park Service won't be able to maintain the land if a lot of people show up.  That's what people say, anyway. Not saying I agree.  Also, Roxanne Quimby, who initially proposed the park, said in 2011 that Maine is ""a welfare state” full of old fat people (seriously). People remember that, and while it might be true, Mainers are proud, and it was hard to hear."
Maine,3bl8jl,timaladyetz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:37:40 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I love Baxter! But it not being a state park is what I read on their official site. From the BSP Authority website:   ""While Baxter State Park bears the name ""State"" it is separately administered, free from any connection with the larger State Park system (Bureau of Parks and Lands/Dept. of Conservation). The Baxter State Park Authority, a three person authority consisting of the Attorney General, the Director of the Maine Forest Service and the Commissioner of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, has full power in the control and management of the Park and in the exercise of all Trust obligations."""
Maine,3bl8jl,Soulthriller,4,Tue Jun 30 18:49:51 2015 UTC,"It is absolutely a state park. The distinction they're trying to make is that it's administered differently than all of the other, smaller, less awesome parks in the state. It's still land given to, owned, and maintained by the State for the use of the public."
Maine,3bl8jl,timaladyetz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"It just means it doesn't fall under the same umbrella as the rest of the state parks around the state, but it's as ""real"" as any of them. Because of the way the land was donated, a large number of rules and laws were established for managing the park (one of the best being it's forever free to use for Maine residents). The rest of the state park system doesn't follow these rules, and BSP doesn't follow theirs.  These rules can be strict; example: back in the 70s I believe, a large forest fire broke out in the southern part of the park. Fighting it on foot & by air was ineffective, so they wanted to bring trucks and other equipment in. Problem is, they'd need to widen roads in places to do so. It finally took a act from the legislature to allow them to do this."

Maine,3bjlfx,neuromonkey,-17,Mon Jun 29 22:29:36 2015 UTC,I think you're overestimating the decision making abilities of a seven year old. That’s like a first grader... and the cops didn't just show up and pick out one girl... someone had to have tipped them off to what was going on.
Maine,3bjlfx,giantslor,15,Mon Jun 29 21:00:52 2015 UTC,"What kind of decision-making abilities does she need at the park across from her house, though? It's not like her mom was letting her choose whether or not to operate a commercial flight during a thunderstorm. She just walked across the street to go on the fucking slide, it's not a situation that requires adult-level decisionmaking.  Honestly, I think the police taking her away to the station was probably far more harmful to her than anything likely to happen at the park."
Maine,3bjlfx,landoindisguise,-16,Mon Jun 29 21:07:42 2015 UTC,"Have you ever been to this particular park? It's in an area that's industrial/slum apartments... it has a nice playground since the city has cleaned it up recently but the park itself abuts a riverbank where some questionable characters hang out. As a parent, I would never let my 7 year old girl run around without an adult accompanying her.  Like I said, someone with more knowledge of this little girl's situation called the police. The police didn't do anything wrong... the mother made a mistake and now she's pushing media coverage. It's ridiculous."
Maine,3bjlfx,giantslor,7,Mon Jun 29 21:19:44 2015 UTC,"I feel that the mistake made by the police is greater than the mistake made by the parent. You've clearly imagined the horrible things that could happen to your 7 year-old if you left her alone. I'm not clear that they're all terribly realistic.  I've lived in the same shitty neighborhood in Bangor for 9 years. The families on the street let their kids run around outside by themselves. I've never felt that this is a mistake, and I can't imagine it would occur to the police to stop and pick one of the kids up for being unattended.  Kids fall down. Kids hurt themselves. I broke bones, knocked a tooth out--hell, my dad once chopped off one of my fingers (accident, people, accident--or so he claims,) but those were unusual occurrences. No sane parent would decide to keep their child permanently indoors, in a childproofed environment, being continuously monitored by an adult, simply due to the possibility of injury.  Sorry, but when I see parents in a supermarket screaming ""COME HERE, JUSTIN! COME HERE RIGHT NOW!"" because their kid has gotten 20' away from them, it doesn't feel like vigilant parenting, it feels like an overreaction, and kind of nuts.  And... from the videos... that park looks pretty safe to me."

If it's right across from her house, though...   someone with more knowledge of this little girl's situation called the police   I'm not sure why you're assuming someone has knowledge just because they called the cops. People call the police all the time for all kinds of nonsense. It's not uncommon to see stories on /r/parenting where mothers call the cops on dads hanging out at the playground for being perverts when they're just there watching their kid. They have zero knowledge, they just see a man looking at children and call the cops. Maybe the person who called the cops had more knowledge of the situation than we do, but I don't know why you're assuming that. It could also just be some nosy lady who asked the girl ""Where's your mommy?"" and then called the police without any further idea of what was going on.    As a parent, I would never let my 7 year old girl run around without an adult accompanying her.   As a parent, I might. My parents certainly did. I mean, if the park is next to where meth heads hang out or something, then yeah, it's dangerous. But otherwise, what's going to happen to her?"
Maine,3bjlfx,landoindisguise,-7,Mon Jun 29 21:34:33 2015 UTC,I would presume it's a hangout for drug abusers and drunks. And if you're on the opposite side of the street it's such a long distance that you wouldn't be able to figure out which kid was yours without binoculars.

Maine,3bjlfx,oddfuture,8,Tue Jun 30 15:59:20 2015 UTC,"Good lord. I grew up in Brookline, MA, a city next to Boston. In first grade I walked to and from school every day, played outside, and walked to and from friends' houses all the time. My parents were pretty ""normal.""  Sure, there are crazy people out there who would hurt a child, but it's hardly a common occurrance. About 700 kids go missing every day. 80% are taken by a family member, 90% are found within ""hours or days,"" and only 1/20th of 1% are kidnappings by strangers. That comes out to around one kid taken by a stranger in the US every three days. Could it happen? Sure, absolutely, but the overwhelming likelihood is that it won't.  If ""normal"" means that we're all so hyper-vigilant about policing not only our own children, but the children of strangers--to the point that we're taking kids away from parents who let their kids walk outside, unattended... the problem is not what could happen to the kids, it's what we're calling ""normal.""  Car accidents, by comparison, injure and kill FAR more kids every day. That doesn't inspire the same sort of thriller movie instant-freak-out response, though.

More people are either suing because something happened to their kid, or not taking care of the kid at all, and because it was sort of unwritten at the time, there isn't a clearly established set of rules. What age is too young to go X amount of time Y distance from home? How do you treat a runaway situation where the kids sneak out without the parents' knowledge? What percentage of their time is considered reasonable for a parent to directly watch their kid? Can they even blink?

That said LePage is working to cut the income tax - very much in line with both Republican and Libertarian ideals and with the support of the population.  The republicans opposing him are those holding offices fearing his opposition to corruption will carry over to them and opting to side with the libtards as a result, ergo the corrupt members of the party dislike him -  the actual members of the party like him and he is doing everything he possibly can within the limits of his power, in spite of the libshits working against him at every level."

Maine,3bivos,Wistfield,6,Mon Jun 29 16:39:18 2015 UTC,There's one guy in the Old Port who regularly goes up to people and asks for $5 because his car broke down. He's done that to me a couple dozen times now. You'd think he'd start recognizing regulars.

It's not a big deal when you come off 295 into Portland because you can just drive by the people at the intersections, the real problem is on exchange and commercial street. These are areas where the cruise ships unload and tourists hang out. It's bad for our image as a beautiful coastal town and could have a negative affect on our tourism."

Maine,3bivos,bblodge,4,Tue Jun 30 16:34:21 2015 UTC,There is one woman who hangs out outside of Whole Foods.  She comes in regularly to buy coffee/lunch or just warm up.  Someone struck up a conversation with her one day and she freely admitted she did it to pay her cable bill.
Maine,3bivos,maine1234,3,Mon Jun 29 22:25:22 2015 UTC,"As a native Mainer who lives outside the state, Portland is #2 on my anecdotal list of homeless people/square mile, with San Francisco being #1. Every time I visit Portland it seems to get worse.  Another anecdote, while visiting in the Old Port, I was asked for money. I said no and continued walking - this individual proceeded to throw a tantrum, kicking garbage cans and yelling (which naturally freaked bystanders out).   I'm all for helping people who are down on their luck, but it seems like a haven for them."
Maine,3bivos,Fenn2010,3,Mon Jun 29 22:17:50 2015 UTC,"They hang out in Augusta too, conveniently around the major shopping centers in town, and they seem to take shifts. Back in mid-April I took a day off from work because my well pump died and I needed to get it fixed. I went to Lowes in the morning to buy a new pump and there was a younger guy, late 20s early 30s I'd say, waiting at the light begging for money at around 9am. Well after doing the work and pulling the well pump, I found that it was just some frayed wires and it was an easy fix. So I packed up the new pump I bought and went back into town to return it--this was around 1pm. As I was sitting at the light, the same young guy was there until this older guy came up to him, they talked for a few seconds about changing spots, and the young guy got up to head towards Hannaford while the older guy took the spot coming out of Target/Lowes.   I find their presence annoying because they are certainly not panhandling due to lack of programs and support this state provides for them. They have a roof over their heads, they have food, and they have clothes (both were wearing nice clean new-looking Northface jackets). What truly annoys me is that there are plenty of service related jobs in Augusta that require the same basic skills of holding a hand out for money and standing in one place all day. Even better, its in a climate controlled environment. Nearly anyone is capable of doing this, yet they are choosing to sit on the side of a busy street and beg for money because they do not want to work. This is really proven when its raining or snowing--there isn't a beggar to be seen."
Maine,3bivos,crknig,9,Tue Jun 30 18:11:23 2015 UTC,"They don't really bother me, but I certainly don't give them money. I will usually talk to them, because ignoring them is rude, and politely tell them that I cannot afford to give them money. Usually they are nice,but I don't feel bad not giving them money because if they have zero dollars to their name, thats more than I have since I just finished college and have loans to pay off.   Effecting the image of Portland negatively? Probably, but they have just as much right to hang around portland as you or me."
Maine,3bivos,Kirby420_,2,Mon Jun 29 18:03:25 2015 UTC,"Also, unless a visitor (assuming tourists are the concern over our image) is from somewhere even more podunkey than Maine, they'll see our few beggars and be like ""wow, not many of them here"""
Maine,3bivos,CollectTheColdWar,3,Tue Jun 30 16:30:50 2015 UTC,Some people in Portland's tourism industry feel like it's negatively effecting Portland's image.   Bangor puts the perpetual fuckups right in the heart of the city and even provides them with public transit so they can go to State Street Circle K and arrange to exchange drugs for money on the 2pm Capehart route.   I'd be inclined to agree with them.
Maine,3bivos,OldManDankers,5,Mon Jun 29 18:40:42 2015 UTC,"Something you have to realize though is that a lot of other towns around Maine boast having friendly, safe, homeless free environment/town areas. The reason for this is because the towns around Portland.ME and further out don't tolerate homeless or better yet; don't provide the services that Portland provides for them e.g. (soup kitchen, housing). That ""draw in"" for homeless people in Maine is why we have so many homeless and by extension panhandlers.

I used to be harassed if I didn't give them money or I offered some type of food in lieu of money. Peplle don't really understand how bad it is in the Bay Area until you witness it first hand.

I think  the economy really hasn't gotten any better for low skilled work in Portland since 2007. Social, mental and human services have been cut back despite rising demand for services. It's a recipe for homelessness.  Also, there is/was the change in behavior were panhandling/begging has become acceptable behavior. And, over the last few years it's come back from the courts that panhandling is constitutionally protected free speech (I think it was specifically over begging in medians in Portland).  Generally I'll offer food, but I understand not everyone wants it. I'll walk town enough, and see people for years and slowly figure out that some are drunks/junkies with a problem and a story, and some are just very unfortunate people."

There are a lot of stupid, bigoted people here, but they don't seem very vocal, and I've had almost no contact with them. In the 9 years I've been here, I've yet to overhear someone make an overtly obnoxious ""god hates fags"" type of comment. I have seen a few ""don't redefine marriage""-type bumper stickers.  Mainers can be very insular and tribal. This can mean that they're slow to warm up to you, and also means that they don't tolerate taking shit from members of other tribes. This also seems to make for a live-and-let-live mentality, which I've really come to appreciate. They don't proselytize. If they don't like you, they'll just leave you alone. And there are plenty of people who will like you, and who'll judge you based on who you are as a person rather than what sort of plumbing you've got. I've got a couple of friends here who are on the opposite end of the political spectrum. They're great people, and we actually listen to each other's ideas.  While I'm not crazy about Bangor, Maine is fucking gorgeous. There are a huge number of amazingly beautiful towns here. I grew up in Boston, and I'm used to being in a city, but I wouldn't mind spending a couple of years in one of the tiny, coastal towns.

Maine,3biee8,evilhooker,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:24:58 2015 UTC,"Nope, I forget the name of that one. Canton is across town on Bangor st, other side of the kennebec river."
Maine,3biee8,injulen,-1,Mon Jun 29 23:49:23 2015 UTC,"Southern Maine has some of the best Chinese food you'll ever taste, albeit it's probably the worst for you."
Maine,3biee8,DRLavigne,2,Tue Jun 30 00:58:48 2015 UTC,"I've not spent much time in Southern Maine, but we're actually looking to move south this year, so I'm looking forward to trying out some new places. That said, as someone who lived in China for years, I am skeptical. I like American-style Chinese food well enough, but most of the places I've tried in Maine don't even do that well."
Maine,3biee8,landoindisguise,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"Some good ones are:  China Eatery, OOB  Jan Me II, Gorham   Happy Dragon, Biddeford   There are many more, these are just some of my faves in the area"
Maine,3biee8,DRLavigne,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"Ooh, Gorham is actually the town we're hoping/planning to move to. It'd be awesome if there was a legit Chinese food place there. I'll definitely check it out."

Maine,3biee8,dilplunk,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:25:23 2015 UTC,"The way people change is by meeting people they disagree and realizing people are not defined by their life choices. I wouldn't say going north of Brunswick is a good idea in this case, but it could help some people change."

The takeaway? 4% of the voters up there must have died of old age.   The spirit of Rural Maine isn't going to be won by proving yourself worthy of their respect, it's going to be won by attrition of the aged. Even a 'liberal stronghold' like Orono has all the hateful yokels crawling out of the woodwork to shit on Nicole Maines for trying to live her life. FFS my partner and I have even been followed/tailgated from the [redacted] parking lot to near our apartment by some angry dude in a truck because I guess we walked too close together for his liking.

I'm kind of a numbers guy... and there are a lot of numbers in there... but what the fuck do I do with them all? My gut tells me that this is some sort of cipher or maybe was written by a bot?

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

Maine,3bgk9t,exbex,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:47:09 2015 UTC,"Mother's beach in in Kennebunk is better. You can park right along the sea wall = no walking to get to the sand. And there's a big, new, modern public playground right next to the beach that's perfect for bored little kids.  If your kid likes trains, take him/her to the Trolley Museum. Cheap, and really fun."

Full admission for myself, my wife and the kid was a little over $60.  I wasn't too fond of the price but we were there for more than half the day and had a blast since it wasn't too crowded.

I highly recommend it - everyone loves candy right? Parking down there can be a bit of a hassle though especially around midday on a nice day.  I'll echo another commenter's Trolley Museum recommendation if trains/etc are of interest, as well as the Wildlife Park. Both are great. It's not Maine but over in Rye, NH (a short drive from York), the Seacoast Science Center is phenomenal. Several large tanks with [native] fish + a touch tank + the park surrounding it is well maintained. They have stuff for all ages there. It may not be up your toddler's alley but the World's Largest Rotating Globe in Yarmouth is neat. Obviously go to a beach. Both beaches in York on a nice day are absolutely packed (in my experience at least) and I wouldn't really recommend it. Mother's Beach in Kennebunk is great, but my personal favorite (im a bit biased as I live close to it, but) Ft. Foster in Kittery is great (very quiet even on a nice day and small waves all the time) - there is a small gate fee here just fyi."

Maine,3banao,pewwman,1 point,Sat Jun 27 15:48:38 2015 UTC,I'm trying to see how this is different from Nader in 2000. Nader could draw 10k people in stadium rallies across the country. He got lots of money from small donations and a lot of grassroots support. He got TV airtime.  But it amounted to just a few percent at the polls. The fantasy of Nader building up the Green Party is laughable in hindsight.  I liked Nader's message. I like Sanders' message. I'm glad people are excited about him. Do people think he has a shot at the nomination or the presidency? Is it just about spreading the message?
Maine,3banao,xach,15,Sat Jun 27 17:59:16 2015 UTC,"The biggest difference is that Nader was a third party candidate, whereas Sanders has to secure the Democratic nomination."
Maine,3banao,xach,-2,Sat Jun 27 18:23:25 2015 UTC,"So does that mean that Sanders will be out of the spotlight well before the national election if he fails to get traction for the nomination? Meaning, I guess, no worry about vote-splitting for liberal-minded voters..."
Maine,3banao,Cullpepper,6,Sat Jun 27 18:32:56 2015 UTC,"yes. Sanders is currently competing with Hillary to be the official democratic nominee. That behooves him to position himself as ""left"" of Hillary, who's already a centerist. If he wins the primary, you can expect him to drift toward the center in a run against the GOP candidate."
Maine,3banao,xach,-2,Sat Jun 27 18:40:08 2015 UTC,Really? It seems to me that the Sanders base of support would take strategic centrism as outright betrayal.
Maine,3banao,Cullpepper,7,Sat Jun 27 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"Won't matter after he has the demo nomination. At that point, he has to court center-right to win. Who are the lefties gonna vote for then? Jeb?"

Maine,3b8vhr,alwaysready,4,Sat Jun 27 00:38:43 2015 UTC,"I have satellite internet in addition to my regular DSL. It's capped at 20 GB / month, 10 of those GB only count between 1 AM and 7 AM. The town 10 miles away has at least 3 MB download speeds. My town has 50 people in the immediate area and when my neighbor down the road uses his internet heavily, everyone up the line slows down significantly. So, as a member of this small town and this state, I feel a little second class since we aren't living in 2000. Why should we not have an option for faster internet when we're so close to a town that has speed that might allow me to steadily stream Netflix? My provider flat out told us there were no plans on improving the connection speeds in the foreseeable future, but our speeds are far from what is normally considered ""unacceptable"" on a national standpoint. And if state funding went toward improving internet speeds for you, you wouldn't protest it, nor would you move if you didn't get them."
Maine,3b8vhr,dogstarchampion,2,Sat Jun 27 03:05:23 2015 UTC,"So let me get this straight, you're whining because you can't stream Netflix properly, and you want the government to help pay for that luxury?   Go to /r/firstworldproblems please."
Maine,3b8vhr,injulen,2,Sun Jun 28 19:24:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would like government to offer better broadband access to the residents of our state. I pay my taxes on top of every other living cost just like you. If the state gave subsidies to providers to build better broadband for the areas that needed it, I wouldn't much care if that meant part of my tax dollars contributed to my area or anyone in the state who wasn't adequately provided for in terms of internet. Like I said, we don't live 15 years in the past, internet is more than a luxury. Whether online schooling or trying to run part of a business online, it's incredibly difficult and occasionally impossible to accomplish even small tasks because a page ends up not loading. Half my job requires me to be online to file my reports or obtain job materials, I shouldn't have to drive to town  in the middle of the night to use my friend's internet just because the internet in my town isn't going to work for me.  Sorry, you might not understand any of this, you aren't exactly keen on the modern age."
Maine,3b8vhr,dogstarchampion,2,Sun Jun 28 23:16:11 2015 UTC,"I love modern amenities and I'm a huge science nerd and I think technology is amazing. I use the internet throughout my day to make my life easier. But if I were to choose a career that required it, I'd simply take steps to get the access I needed. It's your choice to live outside of the better broadband areas and if you're patient enough you'll have broadband in a relatively short time provided by the free market. Where there is a demand, it'll get there. Growing up we didn't have cable TV, we made do with antenna or satellite when we could afford it. Ten years later, cable finally came down our road. It takes time. Barely 100 years ago your area probably didn't even have electricity much less instant communications.  Take a step back and appreciate all we have instead of complaining about such a small issue. Your tax dollars are much MUCH better used on more important issues our state faces. Personally I'd rather see the critical infrastructure of roads repaired before any tax dollars go towards internet access. Our state has had budget crisis after budget crisis and it's precisely because of things like this that people think are more important than municipal services, school budgets, and roadways. Let's not keep heaping on new costs hoping it'll make things better before we can actually stabilize what we already have going for us.  The internet is an incredibly versatile and powerful tool. I love it. I use it daily and I advocate more people thinking outside the box in ways to utilize it's capabilities. But I also know that the rapid expansion of the internet culture is going to put access in everyone's hands in no time at all, certainly soon enough that the government has no reason to hurry the process. More than one company has poured millions of private dollars into creating a worldwide wifi and I think that is much more worthwhile. Let's get internet access to everyone first, then worry about getting everyone faster speeds."

Maine,3b8vhr,giantslor,5,Fri Jun 26 23:22:31 2015 UTC,"With only $500 committed, LePage called the legislation nothing more than a ""feel-good"" bill.   He's not wrong.  Also a state fund is a horrible way to go about it and I say that as a long-time nerd that has business relations with fiber providers in the Portland area.  A summary of the situation would be: local broadband providers have to connect to nation-wide networks to provide their service.  Nation-wide providers still need to make money (they overcharge but that's another matter - they ""need"" to keep their profit margins from a business perspective) so to connect up little local providers they cut deals like ""we'll connect you but you can't compete with us on residential service.""  It's a shitty arrangement (fiber actually runs directly in front of my home but they can't connect me because it would mean breaking an agreement with TWC and being charged connection fees that would put them out of business if they tried.)  For state-wide broadband to happen without a national push for it (it has to be someone that can really influence TWC, the state doesn't even have the power to do that without being charged out the ass because when it comes down to it our state is smaller than a major city) or a municipal push for it.  That doesn't mean it can't happen but for it to happen in a logistically-feasible manner we'd have to have individual towns pushing for it, wiring themselves up and interconnecting with eachother.  Once the infrastructure is built out then partnerships could be arranged with smaller fiber providers in the area that already know the business operations and might stand a realistic chance competing with someone like TWC given the increased infrastructure.  TL;DR: If you want state-wide fiber each town has to push for it independently an probably wire themselves up, it's foolish to attempt at the state level if it isn't federally-mandated and the quote from LePage wasn't wrong - a $500 commitment is laughably low for a bill of this scale to be brought up for vote.  If it passed it would basically bankrupt the state or cause us to pay an obscene amount of extra tax to make it happen."
Maine,3b8vhr,NicknameUnavailable,4,Sat Jun 27 01:51:41 2015 UTC,I agree completely. In addition I think municipalities' best chance to make this happen will be to create/leverage partnerships with the smaller local ISPs like GWI and Oxford Networks.

Maine,3bb5rr,swintec,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:44:12 2015 UTC,I am aware of the technologies especially with cable.  Nodes are not for just streets and in many cases serve bigger areas than blocks.  They will serve 100-200 subs (these days) and are just media converters from fiber to RF.  The slow down is not at the node (if we want to be technical) but at the line card / port at the CMTS where the node connects back to.

I've got over $4000 in networking gear in my home, a bunch of which consists of Cisco/Microtik enterprise/ISP level gear that would be quite well suited to perform routing for more than a few Time Warner nodes, and my connection is a load balanced combo of my TWC and my neighbor's DSL connections.

Maine,3b5urp,heslaotian,14,Fri Jun 26 05:31:16 2015 UTC,"I was at the show as well and I found the same to be true. Jim Jefferies was great but the audience just plain sucked.. Also it was about 90 degrees in the theater and all I could think about was how HOT Jim must be standing on the stage wearing a jacket.   Someone two rows in front of us kept getting up (6 or 7 times) to go get a drink or do god knows what and every time she came back it was a whole big production for her to get back into her seat. Holding her backpack/purse straight up in the air as she walked through the seats to get to hers. Very distracting. Also behind me was someone who after every joke would stomp his feet and rock his head forward laughing in my ear. The man directly in front of me had to repeat EVERY SINGLE joke to his friend 2 seats over and on 2 separate people spilled beer on me or my husband.   Jim did a joke about pregnant women and I am visibly pregnant and he said he hates pregnant people and the girl behind me went on a rant about how pregnant people suck and they are the WORST.. I had to laugh that one off but it was pretty distracting.    Also, Jim did a joke about vaccines and mentioned that there is no evidence that it leads to autism and the guy behind us went off about how his 5 brothers all had vaccines and they all have autism.. haha Maybe there is something in the genetics there.. I'm pretty sure  that all 5 of them have breathed air.. Does that mean Air gave them Autism, or drank formula or breast milk.. did that give them autism? Forget what scientists and doctors say this guy knows what he is talking about!  Correlation does not imply causation.. and all of these thoughts were going through my head instead of enjoying the show.  So I agree completely"

Maine,3b5urp,lola_cat,3,Fri Jun 26 15:08:30 2015 UTC,"Everything you said was on point. I was down in the front orchestra seats and the the couple next to use got a combined 10 times to get drinks during the show. This is a comedy show not a bar. My girlfriend went to the seats first while I was grabbing a water and a beer and the same couple tried to negotiate seats with my girlfriend arguing that they wanted to sit near their friends. Girlfriend said ""No"" and the usher looked at the couple and said ""Looks like you got burned"".   Last year I heard the second Bill Burr show was pretty bad too because of the drinking and yelling. I didn't pay to listen to you yell. Shut the fuck up. I am sure the comedians talk about different venues, can't imagine this is getting a good reputation."
Maine,3b5urp,RomanSenate,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:40:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm amazed any comedian would come back. Hannibal Burress got heckled once but he squashed it quickly so it didn't ruin the show.

I've been to comedy shows where there's been drinking allowed in the theater (The State) and no drinking allowed (Merrill - well there isn't supposed to be any) and the non-drinking shows are always more orderly. I've been to comedy shows at Foxwoods and that place is the worst. Everybody staggers out of the casino/clubs and acts like total assholes.  I'm sure not all of the assholes last night were drinking, but I have a feeling the majority of them were and they can easily ruin a good show."
Maine,3b5urp,mentaltrap,3,Fri Jun 26 12:36:34 2015 UTC,I'm not sure booze is the problem. I've been to smaller comedy club in Boston and LA as well as some bigger shows such as Louis CK and have had no problem despite the fact that the booze was flowing.

You didn't ask them to not talk, you turned around and made some snide remark loud enough to get everyone's attention around you, including myself.  I'm quite sure if you would have asked nicely instead of acting like a complete douchebag they would have apologized and the harrassment would have stopped. But you didn't. After that display of douchebaggery I then watched you just make bitchy remarks to the people next to you and in front of you. You in fact did not ask nicely to anyone. You spouted off like some pretentious spoiled kid. And to be honest i was hoping the guy in the jiu jitsu sweatshirt choked you out. If you're going to complain about things maybe next time be sure you aren't part of the problem.

Please stop talking."" Their response was to burp and blow it on the back of my head and passive agressively kick my girlfriends chair when they laughed. Children, that's what they were. As for the people next to me I refrained because they were marginally tolerable for the first hour or so. It was when he got progressively drunker and started yelling out to Jim as if it was a call and response show that I got fed up and told him to stop. I'll say to you what I said to the guy behind me the second time I turned around to confront him, ""In no scenario am I the asshole in this situation. It is you, always you."""

""To try impeachments; limitation of judgment of impeachment; party liable to be tried and punished in court.  The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments, and when sitting for that purpose shall be on oath or affirmation, and no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of 2/3 of the members present.  Their judgment, however, shall not extend farther than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold or enjoy any office of honor, trust or profit under this State.  But the party, whether convicted or acquitted, shall nevertheless be liable to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment according to law.""

Here's an example tool that does this: http://www.appsumo.com/headlines/  That's what happened here - the current headline is:   ""Maine House members launching push to impeach LePage""  compare that to: ""Liberal legislators launching push to impeach LePage"".

Neither headline is clickbait. Clickbait titles are marked by vagueness. They give you enough information to get you generally interested, but not enough to tell you what the content will be. That's the bait. If you know what the content will be, then you haven't been baited into anything. In this case, we know legislators are attempting to impeach LePage. Whether they're liberal or not is an auxiliary fact. What you've done is confused potentially burying the lede with the catch-all term ""clickbait"".   If a misleading, inflammatory, or inaccurate headline was what made something ""clickbait"", then we would have seen the term 25 years ago when people started writing headlines on the Internet. Bad headlines aren't a new thing. Clickbait, however, is a term which has risen in popularity in the past two years as a direct response to headlines that tell us how amazed we'll be at some vague topic. For this title to be clickbait, it would need to say something like, ""Legislators get angry with LePage. You'll never believe what they're doing!""

Maine,3b4m4y,iam_colinwood,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:44:44 2015 UTC,"We don't even need the towns to start laying fiber. 60%+ of the costs of deploying fiber are in laying conduit, getting dig permits, and securing rights of way. If towns would start laying conduit when they do road work ISPs would have no problem running the fiber.  Open access fiber networks are awesome, but out of the price range of most Maine towns."
Maine,3b4m4y,nswizdum,3,Fri Jun 26 02:51:08 2015 UTC,"I know what you're trying to say, but fiber definitely needs to be part of it.    If you leave it up to ISPs they'll cheery-pick the most profitable locations and leave others to eat snow, or ask for thousands of dollars to service them.  TWC already does this to some people just to run coaxial cable.  Every business is guilty, really.  That's why we need to approach it as a universal service like we did for electricity and phone service.  Just because you don't live downtown doesn't mean you shouldn't have access to good broadband.  If Fairpoint were smart they would jump all over this and try to be a partner in improving broadband in Maine, instead they spend enormous amounts of time and money trying to lobby Augusta to keep this from happening; all so they can keep trying to sell us twentieth-century DSL service that doesn't even meet the current FCC definition of broadband.  There would be a significant opportunity for them to bid on the engineering and build-out of municipal fiber projects, and also the opportunity to leverage these projects once complete as an anchor FTTx ISP.  Fiber is really the only way we'll get good broadband in Maine.  It's a huge investment for a municipality, but state funding would go a long way; it might also open the door to matching federal funds through development grants."
Maine,3b4m4y,soucy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:21:48 2015 UTC,"The nice thing about conduit is the lower cost to deploy fiber. TWC and Failpoint probably would not even be interested in the conduit as they have infrastructure on poles, but other 3rd parties would be interested, and would bring in much needed competition."
Maine,3b4m4y,nswizdum,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:16:45 2015 UTC,"I think you're brushing the cost of fiber under the rug a bit.  Even with work like you suggest there is still a multi-million dollar investment in running fiber in the community.    I work with several of these smaller providers; having the conduit filled with fiber so they can just make use of it would be a much lower barrier to entry.  Even with the conduit in place, fiber is still a significant investment and one that smaller providers simply can't afford to make on their own.    We also don't want competing providers running their own fiber and building out duplicate infrastructure.  This is what happens today; both TWC and Fairpoint spend incredible amounts of money building out fiber on the same path and same poll for the profitable areas and the other areas get neglected.  It's a form of vendor lock-in, as providers end up avoiding building service where another provider already exists unless it's a really dense area and profitable to do so despite competition.  So consumers end up in the same boat of being stuck with one provider if the provider owns the fiber, and when they want to switch, the competing provider just quotes them a ridiculous amount of money to run new fiber to reach them.  The entire point of open access fiber is the fact that fiber itself is expensive to deploy but has a long usable life and allows for the service to be upgraded through equipment upgrades rather than running new lines.  So you build the fiber and the huts for communications equipment to be co-located and the providers investment turns into leasing strands and purchasing equipment which opens the door for much smaller providers to have a chance."
Maine,3b4m4y,soucy,0,Fri Jun 26 11:40:37 2015 UTC,"What if I told you i'm rolling out FTTH for $100k? It doesn't have to be a multimillion dollar project. Those are the projects that fail. They treat every mile of fiber exactly the same, and you can't do that here. We have areas where the houses are spaced 50 feet apart, and places where you can drive for 10 miles and never see a driveway.  Of course having the fiber in the conduit is a much lower barrier to entry. Its also nearly impossible to do in pretty much every town in the state. Even if they have the money, they aren't going to want to risk getting sued by TWC. People are fearful of ""government control"" and municipal competition with corporations.   Nothing you really said is wrong, its just unlikely. Open access fiber is what we need, but its never going to happen."
Maine,3b4m4y,nswizdum,-1,Fri Jun 26 11:58:34 2015 UTC,"If you leave it up to ISPs they'll cheery-pick the most profitable locations and leave others to eat snow, or ask for thousands of dollars to service them.   It's a bit worse than that.  In Portland we have fiber at work - I happen to live just down the street from where I work and know for a fact fiber runs in front of my home.  Since I had already established a rapport with the ISP that handles fiber I asked how much it would cost me to have them run fiber to my home.  They said something along the lines of ""we have agreements with other ISPs in the area for bandwidth to serve commercial buildings that forbid us from hooking up residential buildings and there isn't enough residential demand to be able to make money on them as it would mean competing with much larger ISPs for that space"" - pretty much all but stating directly ""TWC would crush us like a bug if we tried to compete with them for residential service."""
Maine,3b4m4y,NicknameUnavailable,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:32:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this is what happens when smaller ISPs are dependent on infrastructure from larger ones.  We really need to just go to a model where fiber is a separate type of public utility and the ""fiber utility"" is forbidden from providing services using the fiber directly to keep things fair and avoid conflicts of interest.  This is the model that was setup for Maine Fiber Company for the Recovery Act fiber and one we should replicate for FTTH, IMHO."
Maine,3b4m4y,soucy,-1,Fri Jun 26 10:38:02 2015 UTC,"The issue there is that data throughput is an actual commodity - in order for one ISP to move the traffic of another ISP to another party (it's a non-negligible amount of data require actual infrastructure upgrades on their part to avoid negatively impacting their own customers) they need to be able to at least break even on infrastructure (installation, maintenance and upgrades thereof over time.)  That leads to a lot of collaboration and backroom deals of the type ""if you connect me I won't compete with you in this area"" on the friendlier side and ""if you connect me we can both raise prices in this area"" on the less friendly side.  That said, they're over-charging like mad to begin with - not to negate the actual increased costs involved."
Maine,3b2c7q,pateras,5,Thu Jun 25 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"Really hope we get ranked voting but it's a pretty terrible op-ed.    I'm sure he's trying to dumb it down and make it less intimidating to people who aren't familiar with the issue, but the quote about cereal and the comment about it favoring women is almost insulting.  I think the reason you see more women elected in a ranked choice vote is that people stop voting for who they think could win, and it eliminates that spoiler effect of thinking ""I really like her, but voting for her would be throwing away my vote"".  This isn't specific to women though, it would be true for any candidate historically under-represented, including male independents, and that's the point the writer should focus on."
Maine,3b2c7q,soucy,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:16:09 2015 UTC,How does this favor women candidates? Also the cereal quote in here is terrible.

Maine,3b2c7q,dilplunk,3,Thu Jun 25 14:52:16 2015 UTC,"He stated that it ""seemed to favor"" women candidates.  To elaborate, I think what he's trying to convey is ""There is no hints as to why, but women candidates are seeming to be elected at a higher rate in existing RCV systems as compared to the current, one-citizen-one-vote system.""  I'm sure if his point was that they do favor women candidates theoretically, he'd have produced some logical inference as evidence. Whereas what he did say is nothing more than an observation.  Maybe its bull, but I'd concede that the author doesn't necessarily need to produce a compiled list of election results to back up such a quick and benign observation. That said, if the reader wants to disprove his observation and call the author out for SJW-pandering, I'm sure the public records exist to do so, if the author in fact is."

Maine,3b5qig,xoette1,2,Fri Jun 26 04:45:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the Cape, other than what you already know, it seems. It's the quintessential picturesque, high-income, coastal Maine town.  The culture in Portland is alright. On the surface, it looks like everybody is a pretentious hipster, but, since it's Maine, mostly everybody is still pleasant. There's a pretty good overall art presence, and lots to do during the summer months. Here's what's going down this weekend, just as an example. Lots of street fair type things. First Friday sounds like it might be right up your alley.   I would say people here are quite pleasant. Like I said, it is Portland, but it's also still Maine. I've traveled all over the country, and I've never met people that are as friendly and outwardly polite to perfect strangers as you'll find in Maine. That's not to say that you won't meet people who are straight up assholes, but for the most part, people here are just...kind of taking it slower. The people here are also very progressive -- almost to a fault, heh.   Dating scene is...whatever you want to make of it? There are several different types of bars/pubs around town that will cater to any and all personalities and tastes, so I doubt you'd have any trouble whatsoever meeting like-minded individuals. There's a good amount of night life, yeah. There are several great restaurants/bars/pubs that are all within walking distance of each other. Beer prices are quite decent, too. You can go to Rosie's and buy $1 pints of High Life to get your night started, and then kind of take it from there. Microbrews and microbreweries are definitely part of the Portland culture, too.  As much as I don't like the term, yeah, I would say Portland is a ""foodie"" town. There are several great places to eat, and these places take a lot of pride in their food/culture. And yes, farmers markets aplenty.  Bikes are extremely common in Portland. I live just a hair under a mile outside of the downtown area, and there are designated bike lanes my whole way into work. It is definitely the way to get around, IMO, as parking can be a pain in the ass sometimes. Fortunately my work pays for my parking in a private lot, so parking is never an issue for me when I have my car. However, if that was not the case, I'd bike to work every single day, just because it's much easier to get around.  As far as warnings about moving here -- the winter fucking sucks. I've lived in Maine my entire life, and I'm still not used to our winters. If anything, they seem to be getting worse, and more miserable, haha. You'll have to deal with our governor making headlines every other day for all the wrong reasons.  Regarding the gentrification of Portland -- I think it's something that badly needed to happen somewhere in Maine. Young people are leaving the state in droves after graduating college, because there's literally no reason whatsoever to stay. Maine is a beautiful state, but shockingly, merely living in Maine isn't going to pay your bills. Portland has the jobs that younger people want, even if the market is very tough saturated. I love this state for what it is, but it's also nice to see a blossoming metro area that appeals to younger generations."
Maine,3b5qig,jpGrind,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:33:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this post, especially the info about bicycling. I own a car but much prefer getting around by bike (I know this will be heavily dependent upon the weather in Maine) and have truly grown to appreciate cities and towns that make an effort to install bike lanes and bike infrastructure in general.  And yes, I've been following this LePage stuff ;)  I should mention I've also lived in parts of NH and VT briefly, also during winter, so I'm at least vaguely familiar with the intense cold and heavy snow. I admit that's probably the biggest negative about the prospect of relocating to Maine, but I also miss snow (we never get it where I live) so it's certainly not a deal breaker.  I know this is kind of a random question - but does Maine make a practice of salting the streets, or no? I only ask as I have a vintage car and salted roads are quite bad for it in regards to rust.  Out of curiosity, what are some of your favorite beers and/or breweries in Maine? I love beer and am anxious to see what Maine has to offer in terms of what is locally produced.  Seriously, many thanks for your post!"
Maine,3b5qig,jpGrind,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:57:55 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't have any concerns regarding bike lanes around Portland. The attentiveness of divers on the road, however; that's a different conversation, and an even greater cause for concern.  Yes, Maine streets are salted. If you're deeply concerned about the well-being of your vintage car, it may be best to purchase a ""winter"" car and put the vintage car in storage for the winter.  My beer preference is very broad, in that to me, beer is beer. I can appreciate beers on both ends of the spectrum. Sometimes I want cheap and dirty, other times I want the most bitter, hop-flavored IPA you can throw at me.  The notable microbreweries in the area would have to be Shipyard, Geary's, Gritty, and Sea Dog, off the top of my head. The northern New England area is pretty damn good when it comes to microbrews. Between Portland, Portsmouth, and Boston, you'll be able to find that one special brew you'll miss dearly when you travel outside of the region."
Maine,3b5qig,Wistfield,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:57:08 2015 UTC,Don't forget Rising Tide and Allagash! Both have amazing offerings.
Maine,3b5qig,CrossroadsMaine,2,Sat Jun 27 16:55:54 2015 UTC,"I've lived in Maine 3 years now in the Portland area. Here's my perspective on your questions.  (1) Cape Elizabeth is very nice, although it does have a ""hoity-toity"" reputation with some of the locals.  I suppose that any area with wealth, good schools, and progressive focus (with a sometimes streak of NIMBY) will get you that.  Portland itself has many nice neighborhoods (East End seems like it may be your style, West End and Back Cove are nice too).  Other areas to consider are Scarborough and Falmouth.  (2)  The culture is pretty good.  Its progressive, although the state does have some crazies (LePage is the sitting governor).   In Portland you are going to find more liberals than not.  The town is also very gay-friendly, which I didn't realize until moving here and view as a positive (although I am hetero).  The vibe is a bit more small town than I anticipated, so if you are a big city girl, that takes some getting used to.  People do take life at a slower pace and there aren't nearly as many work-a-holics as in other parts.  Its quaint that the worst traffic is at 4:30 or 5:00, and by 5:30 everyone is home from work.  Part of the culture in Maine, and it is yet to see how this will impact things, is that the population is aging.  Old people are staying here and dying and not as many new people move in.  I believe in the long term that this will strain budgets and potentially remove resources from items that benefit young people (like public schools, etc.) in favor funding items for retirees (like those darn pensions).     (3)    Personality Vibe:  The personality vibe is pleasant, but I wouldn't describe the people here as friendly.  If you compare to the rest of the East Coast, maybe, but I grew up in the South and I think people here are a bit insular and stand-offish.  However, they do tend to be genuinely nice once you get to know them. Another thing that is somewhat cute is that Mainers (especially those that don't travel much and have lived in Maine their whole lives) can be very naive.  Life is different and slower here, and it makes people that grew up here seem somewhat sheltered, in a good way (they are more optimistic and trusting in humanity than a New Yorker, etc.)  One caveat.  Maine is very, very, very white.  I'm not sure how I would feel about living here if I wasn't white.  There could be some challenges if you aren't. Dating Scene:  The dating scene is not great.  I know many women in their 30s and I'm usually less than impressed with the men they are dating (I'm married myself).  If you use services like match.com, you will cycle through the same people as all of your friends, which just seems weird.  A few friends have found good matches, but it took them a long time and several losers to do so.  This is true to a certain extent everywhere, but I travel a lot and have friends across the country and I would say it is more true for Portland than for other cities.  Part of this is that it really isn't that big of a town so there are limited options.  There is some nightlife--mostly music shows and bars, but not a ton.  People also eat dinner here weirdly early, like all the reservations are for 5:30 or 6:00 and some restaurants close at 9(!).  I'm secretly convinced the state has a gremlin infestation since no one appears to eat late. Foodie:  I do NOT consider Portland to be a foodie town, despite its reputation for such.  My career and lifestyle have allowed me the opportunity to sit down to $200+ dinners many times, all over the world.  I find the food in Portland to be overhyped, overpriced, and not very diverse.  If you like expensive American seafood, you are in luck.  But venture outside of those boundaries and the offerings are mediocre or overpriced for what they are.  My husband and I usually add the modifier ""for Maine"" when opining on food.  Like ""This is a pretty good burrito . . . for Maine."" Or, ""That Indian restaurant wasn't bad . . . for Maine.""  Farmer's markets are plentiful here, however, and lots of people are very involved in the local food movement, which is nice.  So that aspect of food is great. Biking:  The area is pretty bike friendly, but not as much so as certain parts of California. The weather is also going to limit biking season, but Portland and Cape Elizabeth are fairly biking friendly (better than average, but not stupendously so).   (4) The Portland area is a great place for people that like the outdoors, like cities (but not big ones), and that like to take life at a slower pace.  A true foodie will need to adjust to the restaurant scene, but it can be done.  Dating great guys will take more effort, but can be done.  Costs of living should definitely be considered, as it isn't a cheap place to live and there aren't as many local discounts as you see in places like Hawaii or other touristy destinations.  (5) Finally, you mentioned rents skyrocketing.  The rental scene in Maine is horrible.  HORRIBLE.  I rented apartments for 13 years in my young adult life, in 5 major cities and I have never seen anything like the Maine rental scene.  Its difficult to find places.  (You can go on Craigslist, but the best places seem to be advertised by word of mouth or signs in the window.  Yes, it is super weird.)  The places you do find can be way overpriced.   (I've seen landlords advertise a place for $2,000, and the when it doesn't rent, drop it to $1800, and so on, until the listing finally disappears at $1,100.  What makes you think that place would ever have rented for $2,000?!!)  So you should really get to know the market so that you will know a fair rental price when you see it, as landlords be cray-cray.  You should also network like crazy to find the good places.  If you buy, however, the crazy landlords are nothing compared to the crazy homeowners in Maine.  The real estate market is also INSANE.  I like to look at and analyze real estate markets as a side hobby, and I've never seen anything like Portland, Maine (including surrounding areas like Cape Elizabeth).  Everyone thinks they are the next real estate mogul.  Multiple houses--multiple--are put on the market 1-3 years after the homeowners buy them at 150% to double the original purchase price.  With no work being done (or a minor thing, like ""fresh paint in the living room"").  Its very WTF, and not backed up at all by the selling prices for those neighborhoods (I mean, it would be one thing if prices were skyrocketing in a hot area, but, uh, they weren't and many people still did this).  So if you buy a house, you also really need to educate yourself on the market so that you can just ignore the listings by the cray-crays and focus on people that seem to actually be interested in selling their home rather than playing make-believe Donald Trump.  It can take a while, because the good inventory goes fast (as in any market), so many of the listings sitting on the market have very unrealistic prices or other serious problems with the home.    Hopefully this post doesn't come off as too negative.  I think the positives in Maine are very nice and hard to match in any other place.  I love living here.  But the idyllic picture that many paint of Maine (Its a foodie town!  So nice to live here!  Lots of stuff to do!) hides some of the darker aspects that surprised me when I moved here."
Maine,3b5qig,CrossroadsMaine,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:42:21 2015 UTC,"This is the holy grail of info I was hoping to come across. So nice to come home and see this response.  Personality) I fully understand what you mean about Maine personality types being nice for the east coast. I, too, have spent time in the midwest and south and have experienced 'southern hospitality' which I don't think exists anywhere else in this country (at least not in the lower 48). NYC, Philly and Boston I've always had somewhat negative experiences with - people cut you off mid sentence, no eye contact, being alarmed/annoyed if someone says hello, etc. I remember Maine not really having any of that kind of callousness which was one of the things that made the people in Maine during my brief stay there stand out so much - there was a very welcoming and inviting warmth. It wasn't down south level, but it was great all the same. :)  Dating) Proximity to Portland appeals to me as it seems like a great mix of people & personalities and I want to be in an environment where meeting new people isn't too hard. Am I ignorant in assuming that if Maine has an epicenter of 'culture', it's Portland? Or is that about right?  Foodie) While I appreciate great restaurant options, I'd much rather have great market/grocery options over restaurants. I love to cook for myself and for others, and having access to quality produce, seafood, farmer's markets, etc is really at the top of my list and what you've said relating to things like a focus on food and farmer's markets is more than reassuring.  Rents) I don't even know how to talk about this without me coming off as some kind of vulture, but rents (even in Cape Elizabeth) are so appealing to me. I'm paying a little over 3,500/mo rent right now for a modern, small-ish condo and rents are continuing to skyrocket with no end in sight. What I can afford in Maine, and Cape Elizabeth in particular, is mindblowing - and again I know this comes across really awful as it belittles the rental situation in ME. I think the rental problems are simply far worse in areas along the west coast so, to my eyes, Maine looks like utopia in comparison which is probably why another commenter seemed a little peeved with my initial post (and understandably so).  Your post has bee so helpful to read, I cannot thank you enough for taking the time to write."
Maine,3b5qig,chefinmaine911,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:38:29 2015 UTC,"I'm glad it was helpful!  Sounds like you will be set on the food (just keep in mind that the winter limits fresh local food, although there are meat shares and some winter vegetables from local farmers).  The ""epicenter"" of Maine culture is definitely Portland, probably followed by Bar Harbor.  For rents, I think it will be a refreshing change from the West Coast for you.  However, I would still encourage you to get a feel for the market so you don't overpay on your rental.  That helps you out (obviously) but anytime a landlord gets an unreasonably high price from a new out of state person, it just encourages the market to continue to be irrational.   Good luck to you!"

It's by far the strangest thing... it's almost like people don't know  how to advertise on the internet in Maine. Several people told me this before I moved here, and it was STILL shocking. I got my rental through someone I happen to meet who ""knew a guy"", so I was WAY WAY WAY lucky (thank god)."
Maine,3b5qig,Guygan,3,Sat Jun 27 13:21:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is so weird, isn't it?  People in Maine don't like to advertise on the internet and they seem to lack common business sense.  I remember watching Shark Tank, the one with the Maine lobster food truck, and Kevin said something like ""What's keeping me from going to your lobster supplier  and doing my own truck--why should I invest in you?""  And the business guys responded with something like ""We have the hook up.  No one else can get this Maine lobster from this guy at this price like we can.""  Kevin said ""Ridiculous.  I'll offer him the same or more money and can do this.""  Had I not lived in Maine, I would have agreed with Kevin.  Since I lived in Maine, I was shouting at the TV:  ""He's right, Kevin!  It makes no sense, but he is right!  You wouldn't be able to find this lobster for sale.  They wouldn't sell it to you like they would a Mainer!  It makes no sense but he is right!""  It is the silliest thing."

""Cape"" (that's what the Beautiful People call it) has the reputation as an enclave for wealthy, entitled twits and their precious snowflake children. As will most stereotypes, it's not entirely true.   Would you consider Portland a foodie town?   If you end up living in Maine, banish the word ""foodie"" from your vocabulary. People will think you're a twat. Yay for you. You like food. Guess what? Everybody likes food. You're not a ""foodie"", you're just a person.  And yes, there are LOTS of really good restaurants in Portland. Yes, there are a couple of farmer's markets every week.  EDIT:   what pros/cons or advance warnings would you give to someone contemplating a move to your beautiful state?   Winter can be difficult and frustrating, unless you pick up a winter sport. If you do, then it's awesome. If you're a nervous driver, you will not like driving in the winter. If you bike, you will not like winter."

Maine,3b5qig,mr_toad_i_cant,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:54:05 2015 UTC,"Hi there! I am also a woman in my mid 30's, and I moved to Maine from south Florida about 2 months ago. I live in the Bar Harbor area, but I wanted to address some of your concerns.  Let me start off by saying that moving to Maine was by far the best decision I have ever made in my life. Yes, I know winter will be hard. Yes, I know it will be cold, and there will be snow, and things will generally be completely sucky. Yes, I am ready for that. I, for one, hate the heat, love the cold and snow. Coming from a place where the lows were higher than it's been all summer here, even in the winter (for the most part), I am in heaven. Maine is the most beautiful place I have ever lived, and not a day goes by where I don't think, ""I'm so lucky to live in such an amazingly beautiful place.""  All of that being said, it can be very difficult to find a rental here in Bar Harbor, and from what I have heard, most parts of Maine. If you are able, I would suggest renting a place on say AirBnB for a month or two, to figure out where you really want to be, and to do some networking. It took me 2 months to find a rental here, and it was a 'know someone who knows someone' kind of fluke situation.  I have found the people here in Maine to be very friendly, but not pushy. Most people are polite until you strike up a conversation with them, and then they want to talk to you for hours.... and this is everyone. The bagger at the grocery store, the random dude at the gas station... everyone looooves to talk. As for dating - I couldn't tell you (I'm married).  A bunch of your other questions are pretty area specific, so I won't keep rambling on. If you want to talk more about moving to Maine, I'd love to talk (as I have just gone through the same thing you are considering). PM me if you'd like!"
Maine,3b5qig,CollectTheColdWar,0,Fri Jun 26 12:31:42 2015 UTC,"This is incredibly helpful, sincere appreciation for taking the time to write! I've spent some time in Hallandale(sp?), Ft Lauderdale and Miami so I can imagine the change to Maine is huge. Obviously the pace is slower, but that's likely what you were after? It's certainly what I'm after. Living in the city for my 20s and most of my 30s has been great, I've been able to experience a lot (and I never want to stop experiencing and discovering new things), but the idea of moving to a more low key place is simply not leaving my thoughts and I'm pretty sure this is the next logical step in my life.  Question, do you feel a little too isolated in Bar Harbor? I absolutely fell head over heels with the beauty of that area, but I also remember feeling so secluded (which I guess is pretty much the point). The idea of having close proximity to Portland is something I really don't want to give up, but nowhere in Maine seems more beautiful than Bar Harbor - not that I'm intimate enough with the state to truly know.  I'm really happy your move to Maine was a great decision. Thank you so much for sharing your thoughts here."

If it did, then nearly everything in r/pics and r/funny would be clickbait since half of their titles are puns and jokes that don't tell you what you're clicking. You're desperate to define clickbait in a way which justifies your use and/or takes me down a peg because, you know what? You genuinely cared about getting people to click."

Maine,3b09gd,DRLavigne,9,Thu Jun 25 01:22:55 2015 UTC,Seems like a pretty thin arguing point.
Maine,3b09gd,NoSpicyFood,-1,Thu Jun 25 01:36:55 2015 UTC,just like eves press release talking points.
Maine,3b09gd,Blam04843,0,Thu Jun 25 01:44:20 2015 UTC,"After reading about Eves' stance on charter schools, prior to being employed by one, I kind of understand why LePage did what he did.  I just don't happen to agree with how. It just seems like he opened himself up to the impending lawsuit."
Maine,3b09gd,NicknameUnavailable,-3,Thu Jun 25 01:38:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure about anyone else, but I'm more worried about the current state of the Maine press, than I am of LePage. Let's break this article down:  Part One  ""Eves, meanwhile, released a statement accusing LePage of “blackmailing” the school for at-risk youths by cutting its funding by $500,000"" -> The burden of proof is on Eves to prove that this is indeed true.   Part Two  ""LePage had written a scathing letter to the school’s two board chairmen, attacking Eves’ qualifications and urging the school not to hire Eves, largely because he was a critic of charter schools.""  This is partially true, yet let's look at this letter.  Here's a interesting section that's barely mentioned:  ""Finally, and most troubling, is the unabashed political patronage on which this selection is based. Speaker Eves hired Mr. Brown (chair, board of directors) to work full time as his Special Assistant for Budget and Policy in his State House office. Now he is chair of the board that is helping to select him as president...""  ""In addition, Erik Jorgensen, another member of the board, was appointed by Speaker Eves to the Legislature's powerful Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee when he was a freshman legislator....""  Part Three  The whole section about the Harold Alfond foundation holding back funding feels very strange to me . These people are like the Oprah of Maine - they'll give you money for just about anything (you had a baby? - here's $500.)  ""the foundation was reviewing the school’s “budget and financial forecasts,” noting that $2,750,000 of $5.5 million in potential grants from the foundation were contingent on the school achieving enrollment and other performance goals.""  Hey PPH, can you link to this document too, or should I trust you by your word?    Here's my tl;dr:   The Maine press isn't doing its job (let's stick to the facts - oh wait, newspapers wouldn't survive without click-bait.) LePage doesn't like Eves, saw an opportunity to cause a stink (and rub in the fact that Eves was against charter schools), and decided it was too good to not highlight. I mean, Eves has been a thorn in LePage's side for 5 years..I totally would have done the same. Eves then gets mad, because that's a $120k/year salary on the line. Both parties are playing politics, which is super unfortunate."
Maine,3b09gd,CaelFrost,4,Thu Jun 25 02:23:51 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard, Brown and Jorgensen recused themselves from any board votes on the hiring of Eves. So, while the relationships should be discussed, that's also an important point to include."

Seems to me like the paper could definitely do a better job at collecting and organizing their point of view, but it also seems like although Lepage is being a little vengeful, he may have a point. Idk anything about the personality or who Eves is friends with, but if ex coworkers are looking to get him a job it's either cronyism (you scratch my back I scratch yours) or its the fact that Brown knows and believes in Eves vision and expertise to lead the school. And the alfonds, as far as I'm concerned they do nothing but good things.   tl;dr   Idk whose right in this, but the pph and your tldr didn't do a good enough job at formulating a viable outcome so I guess I'm just gonna hope there's more followups to this story!"

Maine,3awx73,Boof_Dawg,3,Wed Jun 24 13:00:56 2015 UTC,"That heavily depends on where you're using it. Internet works a lot like how water flows through a pipe. If there are 100 houses on 1 line and they all turn on every tap in the house, pressure is bound to fall for everyone. Internet usage is very, very similar. Usually 5-10PM, everyone is online and using all of the available bandwidth. Things to check are your speed at the router/modem level which you can usually do by logging into your router (like you were going to change your wifi password) and doing a diagnostic speed test, and then a test speed to your computer through wifi (speedtest.net) to see where the problem is. If your router says you're getting 38-45 mb/s (which is acceptable during peak hours) you know your wifi is the problem. If it's 1-10mb/s at the router, call Time Warner.  If you check /r/techsupport, you can also ask about ways to boost your router's performance like changing the broadcast channel wavelength, password protection, setting up port forwarding, etc. You may also need a new modem. You can buy a DOCSIS 3.0 Motorola Arris Surfboard at Best Buy (price check vs Amazon, they'll give you the better deal) and that would probably help as well. Plus if you're renting the modem, your bill will go down 8$/mo and the modem will pay for itself in a year.  Best of luck. I just got our internet squared away last week. New apartment. Our problem was that there were so many wireless networks in range, that when people were using their internet at peak times, ours would tank. You can use a program called WifiInfoView, which is available from CNET to check the broadcast channels of other networks in range of yours. Most are in 1, 3, 6 and 11. I keep ours in 9. It's the frequency of the wireless signal. A channel can be interfered with up to 2 channels away realistically. 11 is the least popular default typically.  I know that's a lot, but I hope it helps. I'm a network engineer in case you were wondering haha. But seriously check the speed at your router first. That will weed out a lot of questions TWC may have and help them narrow it down.  edit : clarification"

Maine,3awx73,Ninjakick666,1 point,Wed Jun 24 15:04:24 2015 UTC,"TWC ""Ultimate"" service here as well.  During the day the connection is perfect.  I get better speeds (both up and down) than advertised.    When prime time hits, though, speeds drop to unacceptable levels... it actually gets to the point where my upload is faster than my download.  YouTube has to buffer and Netflix drops to JPEG quality I didn't even know they could support.    Trying to convince TWC to look at the node has been a tremendous challenge.  They have a checklist of things they need to rule out before they ever even talk to an engineer.  The signal was fine in terms of my line and equipment, despite that TWC had techs come and rip out the year old lines to replace them with new lines, resulting in the same exact signal levels.  This is a straight shot from the poll to the modem, no splitters, and Internet access is the only thing I subscribe to.   When that didn't work they installed an extra modem along side my current one because they didn't believe the problem was happening; turns out it was happening and it left the TWC technicians scratching their heads.  They said they ruled out everything on my end and would have engineers start working on the polls to try and find the problem; that was weeks ago and I'm pretty sure it was code for ""yeah, we're not going to fix this because it's on our end and will cost a fortune"".  The problem with cable is that it's a shared medium; so even if they service the node with fiber and have plenty of bandwidth, ever subscriber that shares a coax run on the poll is in competition with each other.  To fix it they need to split nodes so the number of subscribers is more distributed and there is less demand on the run, but that costs a lot of money (thousands), so they never seem to do it.  DSL would be better if I could get decent service, but even 2 miles away from the CO is too far and the best Fairpoint can deliver is something ridiculous like 3 Mbps.  Hills make wireless a non-option.  TL;DR I'm stuck with TWC and their crappy service, and they know it.  Being in Orono, I'm in a reasonably populated area too.  I can't imagine how much it must suck for people where there aren't enough customers to justify even the smallest investment.  This is why we need open access fiber, unfortunately, even if fiber does come to the area, I doubt it will extend to where I am unless we decide to fund it as a universal service."

Not only do I get to have much lulz when I hear a name I know come over the radio, but there's been at least half a dozen times over the years where I've heard a high priority call of a criminal nature in progress and was in the correct place to either provide a solid witness statement or put eyes on a car police were looking for, because I knew what was going down."

Clearview has been racked up plenty of complaints against them over the past couple of years. I would guess that they just see that as part of what they do. They do hit & run scams and don't care about the rest. They target vulnerable populations--the elderly and young college kids. Once it was clear that I wasn't biting, the guy turned around and walked away--he wasn't interested in making a legitimate sale. When pressure from complaints gets significant, they'll just shift tactics--change the company name, switch industries, etc."

Maine,3au2dr,CollectTheColdWar,3,Tue Jun 23 16:37:21 2015 UTC,"In Maine you'll do nothing but house to car and car to office for five months out of the year, but it's because there's so much snow that it takes three hours to get anywhere."
Maine,3au2dr,Fusion2006,10,Tue Jun 23 17:14:11 2015 UTC,"Topsham, Brunswick, Yarmouth, Freeport. Nice bedroom communities.  I moved from Maine to Florida and then back to Maine.  Some differences to consider:  1. Winter is brutal. Basically, prepare to be cold and miserable from Nov until May. It is kinda cool from Nov until Feb 1st.....then sucks the rest of the year until May. If you ski, it might make it more tolerable.  2. Heating costs. Depending on how old and well insulated your house is will affect your heating costs. But cooling costs in Florida may be similar in costs.  3. Taxes. I made around $55k in Maine. Then took a $45k a year job in Florida. After taxes I made 1 dollar more than my Maine salary. Still stunned at how much I pay in Maine income taxes.  4. Car insurance. This will go down in Maine. In florida I paid $100 a month full coverage.........in Maine.....$50 a month.  5. Car registration.......depending on how new your car is......you will pay alot. No flat fee like Florida. I have a 2010 car and pay around $170 a year. I have friends with a new truck paying $400 a year.  6. Car inspection. Every year your car needs to inspected. You can't let things go like in Florida.  7. Housing costs. Housing costs in Southern Maine are more expensive than the rest of Maine. Probably similar to Florida and you might get more land with the house. But, not a lot of new construction like Florida. So depending on your budget don't be surprised to find that potential houses are 50+ years old.  8. Property taxes. Probably similar to Florida. Portland is $20 per $1000 valuation. So a $200k house will be around $4000. The smaller towns may be higher on taxes. I have friends who live in smaller towns with mill rates up to $26 per $1000 valuation.  9. Summers are amazing in Maine. Basically winter in Florida is like summer in Maine.  10. Snow. On top of the cold......you get snow. So going places in the winter takes some extra thought. Ice and Snow. It sucks.  11. Crime. Very little in Maine. Small stuff like robberies, car theft, etc. Murders are few. Compared to Florida, there are no places that I am afraid to go to in Maine.  12. Also if you decide to snow bird it between Maine and Florida......Maine will still want income taxes. They will just pro rate it for the time you live in Maine. 14. Bangor (allegiant airlines) has a snow bird express to Sarasota and Sanford and Punta Gorda.   Good luck with the move. Be moved by Nov 1st."
Maine,3au2dr,Fenn2010,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:08:49 2015 UTC,You're awesome.  Thanks for all the helpful information.
Maine,3au2dr,Fenn2010,8,Tue Jun 23 17:38:04 2015 UTC,"First my question would be, why? I am not sure if you are a native to the northeast or not, but if you are used to Florida weather, you are in for a massive shock from November - April here. Its cold, it can be miserable. We will have week long spans where we don't see temps above 25 degrees and every night gets to -10 or lower. Heat will be a very large expense in the winter, plus if you are coming on retirement age, then you will probably find it beneficial to hire someone to plow you out and shovel your walkways if you can afford it. Also, if you are unfamiliar with winter driving, then you will have the added expense of buying a separate set of winter tires to prepare for the potential for deep snow and ice that we will ultimately get.  I am not trying to scare you away from Maine, while our winters are cold and long, its also a beautiful state even in the winter.  That being said, if you are looking for affordable living close to shops and healthcare with reasonable housing prices, maybe start your search in Topsham or Brunswick. Both communities are right on the coast, they have lots of shops, restaurants, access to hospitals but are far enough away from Portland to not be an urban setting. Brunswick was formally the home to a very large military base that has recently closed down, so there is a large amount of real estate in the area that is affordable. It has an added benefit of the Downeaster Train in Brunswick which makes its way to Boston in a reasonable amount of time if you desire a day trip to a larger city. You are within 5-10 minutes of a hospital, movie theater, grocery store, Target, Walmart, and Home Depot (or Lowes, can't remember). And its about 20 minutes north of Portland. If it were me, that would be a decent starting point."
Maine,3au2dr,kbuck2000,2,Tue Jun 23 15:51:31 2015 UTC,"Native of New York.  Left after college. Have never gotten used to Florida weather but that is where the job was.  As far as heat being expensive, I pay over $500 per month on electric from May until October to keep the temperature in the house tolerable. I'd need a refresher on ice driving, that's for sure and someone to clear the driveway and walkway which I compare to the pool and lawn service I pay for now.  So, I pretty much know what to expect.  Also, I visit the northeast whenever I can just to get away from this hellhole I call home.  I just want a small place that's quiet and safe with trees, and seasons and a few less wackos."
Maine,3au2dr,ner0417,2,Tue Jun 23 16:12:28 2015 UTC,"Well I'd start looking in what's called the mid-coast region of Maine such as Brunswick, Topsham, Bath, maybe as far as Wiscasset (mid-coast goes further up to Rockland and beyond a bit, but based on what you've asked for I wouldn't go too much further than Wiscasset). If you don't need to be on the coast, then go north-west inland 10-15 miles from any of those communities and you will find much more affordable homes with land and trees to spare but in small communities where you could be 30+ minutes away from anything in the winter.   Safety is probably the least you need to be concerned about here. People keep to themselves for the most part and crime is very low. The worst type of crimes in rural areas tends to be break-ins into unlocked cars and homes or seasonal homes/camps where careless people leave valuables visible. Of course thats all related to a bit of a drug problem we have here, but still its nothing compared to the much more violent crime of Florida.  As others stated, taxes will probably be a shocker for you here. They are high. Property taxes are different town to town as the majority of a local budget is schools (probably 60% or more) and its not controlled by the county or the state, so some towns have astronomical school budgets for their size. The majority of the rest is usually a form of public works or paying private contractors for road construction and maintenance as our winters are brutal on our roads and salt/sand and plowing makes up a huge part of that budget. Either way, even small homes on a small plot of land are probably spending at least $1k a year in property taxes and most likely significantly more than that.   Another thing, enjoy your car now, within 1 winter of  being here, everything under your car will turn to rust and the body will start rust within the year after. Our major roads and highways get covered in a liquid salt to melt the snow and ice quickly. It makes winter driving a lot safer but makes a brand new car look 10 years old after one winter. The coast tends to get a lot more severe winter weather--more snow and more ice. But, they also tend to stay warmer a little longer in the fall and see spring sooner than we do inland by a week or two--trust me it makes a difference when you only have 3-4 months of good warm weather."
Maine,3au2dr,alwaysready,3,Tue Jun 23 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"I know it's not what you are asking, but is the east coast a must?  The reason I ask is because a trip to Boston is only 1.5 hours away.  Great for day trips.  NYC is about 5 hours away.  Great for extended trips.  When you live Down East you are pretty much stuck in Maine full time unless you want to take a few days or more to get way."
Maine,3au2dr,Scoundrelsprincess,2,Tue Jun 23 16:39:41 2015 UTC,Not a must at all.  Your advice is probably better.  My son's moving to Boston and I have tons of people in NYC.  Just so beautiful there but I can always drive in the summer to the coast.

Maine,3au2dr,mydogcecil,3,Tue Jun 23 18:17:01 2015 UTC,"This past winter was especially brutal and I think its stuck in our minds and reminded us of what winters were like about 15 years ago. I remember in the early and mid 90s that we had long, cold winters and then the last 10 years or so we've had rather mild winters with little snow and by mid March we are seeing 50 degree days. Yet this year, winter never really left until almost May and even then we had a few frosty mornings in mid May. And even now we have yet to see a day above 80 degrees (at least in central Maine). So the bitterness is most likely stemming from this past winter and it still sticking to memory of how long, cold, and snowy it can be here."
Maine,3au2dr,codejudge,2,Wed Jun 24 12:35:57 2015 UTC,That's why we're getting out of South Carolina as soon as possible. I'd rather be sitting at home during an ice storm and no power with a wood stove than trying to stay reasonably cool in this miserable 90+ degree weather here. I hate it.

Bath a larger town--nearby is a beach, theatre, arts/fartsy stuff.  The rural areas of Maine are actual fun--well, along the mid-coast. I spent two years living in Richmond/Dresden; there are ponds, rivers, farms, etc. Of course, I worked 60+ hours, so maybe that's why it didn't get boring for me. The people are...even keeled? Nice, but inclusive too. You need to hang a bit to make friends, being willing to volunteer places goes a long way here--farmer's love free labor. You'll get veggies, probably."

Since I have a form of Schizoid personality disorder, friends are not an issue.

If you cannot afford one, take a trip to your local firehouse. If they don't have any on hand they will find a way to get you one.   Preventable deaths are the worst kind to read about."
Maine,3as0rl,NotYou007,11,Tue Jun 23 02:41:25 2015 UTC,"As someone with a even the tiniest amount of imagination it isn't that hard to understand. Many smoke detectors will go off at just the slightest hint of smoke or too much steam.  So when you're making toast you end up having to pull the battery to stop the beeping and then you don't put it back in on your rush out the door to work.  Then you never think of it again, and when a fire happens you have no warning.   In wall mechanical heat alarms solve this issue as they will only go off during an actual structure fire, and they never run out of batteries.  Hard wired smoke detectors also solve some of the issues, but can still be overly sensitive.  Sprinkler systems take care of these issues as well but are cost prohibitive in many situations.  Making pretend this is somehow an incomprehensibly stupid situation doesn't help anything!  No one is going without smoke detectors because of cost, they are 3.95 at Walmart, battery included.  They are an annoying afterthought to many folks, that is why they don't have working ones. They are poorly designed, run out of batteries, are overly sensitive, and are never user friendly.   Battery operated smoke detectors are just not a great choice for many people. Most folks have never been and never will be in a house fire so it really isn't hard to understand why they don't think about smoke detectors all that often."

Maine,3auvfd,Guygan,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:19:59 2015 UTC,"Medical marijuana has not been proven to work for many illnesses that state laws have approved it for, according to the first comprehensive analysis of research on its potential benefits.  The strongest evidence is for chronic pain and for muscle stiffness in multiple sclerosis, according to the review, which evaluated 79 studies involving more than 6,000 patients. Evidence was weak for many other conditions, including anxiety, sleep disorders, and Tourette’s syndrome and the authors recommend more research.  The analysis is among several medical marijuana articles published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. They include a small study suggesting that many brand labels for edible marijuana products list inaccurate amounts of active ingredients. More than half of brands tested had much lower amounts than labeled, meaning users might get no effect.  THE ANALYSIS  The researchers pooled results from studies that tested marijuana against placebos, usual care or no treatment. That’s the most rigorous kind of research but many studies found no conclusive evidence of any benefit. Side effects were common and included dizziness, dry mouth and sleepiness. A less extensive research review in the journal found similar results.  It’s possible medical marijuana could have widespread benefits, but strong evidence from high-quality studies is lacking, authors of both articles say.  “It’s not a wonder drug but it certainly has some potential,” said Dr. Robert Wolff, a co-author and researcher with Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd., a research company in York, England.  EDIBLE PRODUCTS  Researchers evaluated 47 brands of medical marijuana products, including candy, baked goods and drinks, bought at dispensaries in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.  Independent laboratory testing for THC, marijuana’s leading active ingredient, found accurate amounts listed on labels for just 13 of 75 products. Almost 1 in 4 had higher amounts than labeled, which could cause ill effects. Most had lower-than-listed amounts. There were similar findings for another active ingredient. Products were not identified by name.  Johns Hopkins University researcher Ryan Vandrey, the lead author, said he was surprised so many labels were inaccurate. The researchers note, however, that the results may not be the same in other locations.  MARIJUANA LAWS  Twenty-three states and Washington, D.C., have laws permitting medical marijuana use. Approved conditions vary but include Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, glaucoma, kidney disease, lupus and Parkinson’s disease.  An editorial in the journal says approval in many states has been based on poor quality studies, patients’ testimonials or other nonscientific evidence.  Marijuana is illegal under federal law and some scientists say research has been stymied by government hurdles including a declaration that marijuana is a controlled substance with no accepted medical use.  But in a notice published Tuesday in the Federal Register, the Department of Health and Human Services made it a little easier for privately funded medical marijuana research to get approved. The department said that a federal Public Health Service review of research proposals is no longer necessary because it duplicates a required review by the Food and Drug Administration.  THE FUTURE  Colorado, one of a few states where recreational marijuana use is legal, has pledged more than $8 million in state funds for several studies on the drug’s potential medical benefits, including whether it can reduce veterans’ symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. That study may begin recruiting participants later this year, said Vandrey, one of that study’s leaders.  Vandrey said there’s a feeling of optimism in the research community that “we’ll start to get a good science base” for the potential medical uses of marijuana.  THE RECOMMENDATIONS  The editorial by two Yale University psychiatrists suggests enthusiasm for medical marijuana has outpaced rigorous research and says widespread use should wait for better evidence. Federal and state governments should support and encourage such research, the editorial says.  “Perhaps it is time to place the horse back in front of the cart,” Drs. Deepak Cyril D’Souza and Mohini Ranganathan wrote in the editorial.  They note that repeated recreational marijuana use can be addictive and say unanswered questions include what are the long-term health effects of medical marijuana use and whether its use is justified in children whose developing brains may be more vulnerable to its effects."

Maine,3auvfd,hesh582,0,Wed Jun 24 03:12:00 2015 UTC,Where are all the pro-MMJ people?  Weird....
Maine,3auvfd,Mikerm3,4,Wed Jun 24 01:01:34 2015 UTC,"I'm pro MMJ and I completely agree with everything in the article.  Being pro medical pot doesn't mean blindly thinking that it's a wonder drug.  I also think that the system they have in California where everyone has ""anxiety/insomnia"" that they treat with pot is obviously not based in any medical fact.  In areas like combating chemo-related nasuea, the benefits seem to be potent and undeniable.  As the scientist in your article says “It’s not a wonder drug but it certainly has some potential"".  I think continued research is important to determine the actual areas where medical MJ can help.    Legalization at the federal level is important for this, because as it stands there is actually very little high quality long term research into the subject.  As a schedule I drug, it's very difficult for any university to conduct truly meaningful and scientifically relevant research into MJ and so the body of literature on the subject is extremely lacking.  We really don't have the slightest clue how pot performs medically, and won't until scientists and doctors are actually allowed to study it properly."

It recently lost its defining feature - the mill which dominated the town's skyline is now nothing more than a giant hole in the ground. The sense of loss is palpable. When I was a kid we used to go to Millinocket to go shopping or to eat out, today many of the businesses are shuttered, and half of the houses are abandoned, their porches and sheds caving in, their lawns unmowed.   The people there are mostly elderly folks who can't imagine going somewhere else or seeing their economy transformed to something they wouldn't recognize, plus a few younger people with a diehard commitment to their home.  It's a town that is likely to dwindle to a tiny cheerful settlement at the gates of Baxter and/or the Maine Woods National Park over the next 60-100 years as the abandoned homes are demolished and reclaimed by the forest. I foresee a few more restaurants and hotels in their future, a bustling little outfitter shop equivalent to Indian Hill in Greenville, some busy little hunting/fishing/rafting guides setting up shop, maybe a microbrewery, maybe a small sawmill and a little craft furniture or cabinetmaking factory.

Maine,3am7b3,poneil,4,Mon Jun 22 12:29:24 2015 UTC,"You are completely accurate. I live in south-central Maine. Most towns have already gone down the drain and most 'cities' are headed that way. The only thing keeping a place like Augusta or Waterville going is government and health care. In another 15 years or so when the baby boomers are gone, its all going to fall on the shoulders of my generation, yet by that time I am still 15+ years from retirement and there is absolutely nothing to keep me here once my parents are gone and our towns and cities have literally crumbled away.  Its already happening in most of the small towns where class sizes have dwindled down to such small numbers yet the school budgets are continuing to grow. Its a much more common thing over the last few years to see school budgets not get passed in smaller towns because people don't want their property taxes to jump up by 15% yet they still demand that their tiny school system still keeps an individual elementary school in each town in the district running, a half-empty middle and high school going, and all their sports programs should be free. The residents scoff at the high cost of education but scream when a school is threatened to be closed or consolidated. This is only the beginning as towns continue to shrink and people move to Portland or out of state and the burden is still left on the remaining residents.  Between the impending financial doom that rural Maine faces, the extremely high cost of heat in the winter, and the fact our winters can be upwards of 6 miserable months long, I do question why I am here and wonder if maybe I should move to a better part of the state or to another state entirely before my daughter is school aged. Still, there is something keeping me here. I cannot say what exactly, but whenever my wife and I talk about it, we both just end up concluding its probably just as bad somewhere else and we aren't the only state with major issues in rural communities and cities completely relying on healthcare and government to keep it going."

They don't bother me. They add some much-needed fresh blood. Same with the refugees, asylum seekers, and just plain immigrants--the diversity Maine has gained since I moved away has made it a lot easier to move back from the bigger cities.  What does bother me is the telecommuters who have taken over Munjoy Hill. They can be found in the restaurants and coffee places, still braying about real estate in Brooklyn as if anybody gives a fuck, or wearing suits outside on a Sunday night, yelling into their phones about the best exit to take from the Thruway, or squealing at the donut truck about how there's nothing like this on Staten Island (it's a beautiful day in Maine, nobody wants to think about Staten Island right now FFS)."

However, when I went to school in Orono, you got the vibe that the further away from Portland you got, the more people didn't care for its liberal attitude and disapproval of the rest of the state. This is especially dumb for people in Portland who have never been to Camden, Bar Harbor or Eastport, which are all awesome places to see, but they get all butt hurt if you tell them to leave the city and experience something that's not a bigger city.  Portlanders will tell you that Portland is the best part of visiting Maine (probably not true), while people outside of Portland will tell you to skip in general because it's not a ""true Maine experience"" (also not entirely true).  And for people who say they'd rather drive past Portland and another 2 hours to get to Boston, have fun. You can trade in liberal hipster douchebags for abrasive racist Masshole bros. You can talk about how great the Entourage movie was. I give you two hours before you want to leave the Commonwealth and punch everyone you see in the mouth.

Maine,3am7b3,SummonKnight,4,Mon Jun 22 00:16:01 2015 UTC,"I think part of the problem for Maine is that this is a state that has vastly different sections and attitudes. One of the more eye-opening experiences I had as a kid was in middle school we had some little model UN thing in Machias. For whatever reason we were all assigned to go to the homes of some parents of kids in that school district that lived in that area for an overnight since it was 3+ hours from my hometown in Readfield. I remember the parents asking me where I was from and when I said so, they said 'Oh, you have that capital influence then don't you?'. I didn't know how to respond, then the wife said 'Well at least he's not communist from Portland.'   It was just eye opening to what other people in a much more rural part of the state thought about me and then others from further south. I was surprised to see that I was not exactly liked, but not nearly as hated as being from Portland."

I guess if you squint really hard, they could look nice, but their downtowns have basically been gutted and turned into a bunch of incredibly samey gift shops. Yes, Portland's waterfront is much the same, but at least there's more to Portland than the tourist nonsense. In Bar Harbor and Camden, there's no real town left, just ""Ye Olde Gifte Emporium"" and ""Captain Surmullegon's Sea Shanty Shack"". No way are those towns a real Maine experience.  I agree with you, Massachusetts is awful, the bros are something that need to be seen to be believed.

Maine,3am7b3,jonar33,2,Sun Jun 21 23:37:48 2015 UTC,"Portland is a nice place to visit, but I'd never live there. My wife and I enjoy going there to shops and restaurants you cannot find anywhere else in the state. We like going to see the Sea Dogs or other events in the city. Yet, its not home and it has nothing to do with the people or the city, urban/city living is just not what I find enjoyable. I grew up in rural central Maine and still live there now. I live in an old farmhouse on 7+ acres of land, surrounded by woods, fields, and pastures. Each morning I look out my window as deer cross my field to go drink out of the farm pond at the edge of my property. This morning I looked out my window and saw a doe and her fawn hop across the lawn. The fawn was trying to play while mom was nudging her along. That may not be something everyone enjoys, but I do and I know its not happening within a city like Portland.  The people of Portland and its image of more liberal people and policies has some truth to it, yet as I now live in a small town and pay attention to local politics so I can vote for the school budget and the town selectmen, its very clear to me that most of this state is quite liberal. Sure we've voted in somewhat of a blowhard conservative governor and we have a pseudo-republican senator, but in general it seems local elections are pretty favorable to the liberals over conservatives except when our hunting/fishing rights are threatened. Then its not so much that the right wing nuts come out in droves, I think hunting/fishing is a real Maine heritage that transcends politics and in general even the more left-leaning people in this state don't want to see some of our traditions changed (I am not trying to preach politics here, just making observations from previous elections). I think in general, especially with rural Mainers, Portland is the easy place to make fun of or blame for issues, yet at the end of the day many of these same vocal Mainers have many neighbors that are more aligned with the thinking of people from the Portland area or are even voting that way themselves, but aren't willing to admit it.  So for me, I enjoy Portland for its good food, nice shops, and actual entertainment but I love rural Maine for what it is as well. It doesn't hurt that the cost of living allows for me to own a nice home and a sizable piece of land for a fraction of what it would cost in the Portland area."

The native Portlanders actually resemble real Mainers more than most of us would care to admit, all the young refugees from northern Maine and/or Africa tend to be cool and interesting people. My main complaints about Portland are that normal Mainers can't generally afford to live there. Even skilled jobs on the local market generally will not cover even modest cost of living on the peninsula. You have to be a telecommuting stockbroker, lawyer, or accountant to actually live comfortably in Portland. My other complaint is winter - winters in the North are a glorious season of playing in the snow and ice, but in Portland you don't get enough snow to play in but you still get to experience being cold as fuck for 6 months. On the rare occasions that it does snow, it's beautiful for about 40 minutes before it turns into gray sludge full of cigarette butts and other urban detritus. Pretty gross."

Personally, it never occurred to me that a hayride could be dangerous. Even if it had, I do not have the knowledge to evaluate a hayride wagon or vehicle for its safety. I think it's reasonable for those in authority to use their authority to gather some facts and figures, perhaps request information from other states on what they do, to determine how big of a scale this problem is. If it's a once in a hundred years event, ok, that's a fluke which requires no further response. Or maybe that particular owner has a history of accidents. Or maybe there is actually a pattern of several significant injuries a year, in which case we should look at why that is, and how to respond. I have no idea. Therefore, I think it is reasonable to research the matter in the interest of public safety."

Maine,3afnir,alwaysready,-7,Sat Jun 20 00:15:52 2015 UTC,Lepage and his kind of policies are directly responsible. It's obvious that someone down and out on their luck (for whatever reason) and desperate without community resources is going to say at some point- fuck it. Why not? What do they have to lose. It's pretty simple really. I'm surprised that the homeless and desperate aren't organizing and doing this shit more often. Some of these people have little to lose. But then again maybe it's just some greedy lazy fucks doing this for quick drug money. I really don't know. But seems to me when you don't have any resources to survive or help get you on your feet you might as well steal from the community that keeps you there.

Maine,3aefhy,lacrimaeveneris,3,Fri Jun 19 18:46:33 2015 UTC,That would not be a wise thing to do at this moment.  Since energy prices have moved down and over the last 6 months there's a record amount shale gas rigs (fracking) being decommissioned until prices rebound. Decommissioning rigs means layoff for rig workers and support jobs. Boom towns in places like South and North Dakota are doing terribly.
Maine,3aefhy,lacrimaeveneris,2,Sat Jun 20 01:56:55 2015 UTC,"There are no boom towns in South Dakots. No fracking here (I live in Sioux Falls, now). There's still lots of work in ND but the cost of living is so high is almost negates the high wages."
Maine,3aefhy,2S1K,2,Sat Jun 20 02:53:52 2015 UTC,"Since you said you have a psych degree, there are a number of social service jobs the further north you go. Portland has a LOT of providers, but also a lot of people, so sometimes jobs are a little more difficult to secure.   Be prepared for a wage that seems low - COLA in Maine is relatively low (outside of the larger towns), though Rockland and the midcoast can be expensive.  indeed.com has been a helpful job hunting site."
Maine,3aefhy,jonar33,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:52:03 2015 UTC,"That's a bit of the issue I'm having down here with jobs. There seems to be a ton, but then at the few I've bounced around at there were anywhere between 50-80 applicants per job. Pretty much meaning these places are totally fine paying people pretty low, because they know we just need the money.   And Rockland and the coast are my far away, fully successful adult dreams haha I just want to be close enough to them that I can remember I have at least some sort of goal/direction in life.   Thank you for this, this is the type of stuff I'm looking for."
Maine,3aefhy,Snacky_Creamhorn,2,Fri Jun 19 17:37:34 2015 UTC,"If you're not dead set on living right on the ocean, moving slightly inland (e.g. Belmont or similar), you'll still be close to the coast and can commute very quickly to the water. I wouldn't say it's unreasonable - I'm 27 and live and work in the midcoast :) - but it does have a somewhat higher cost of living (and if you're looking at Belfast, Rockland, or similar, RENT until you can afford a home and property taxes) that I wanted to warn you about.   Are you willing to look at somewhere like Bangor or Augusta? Still ""cities"" by Maine standards, but further enough north from Portland that there are fewer applicants?"

We've got rivers and streams and bays! There is water EVERYWHERE (I live in Belfast, near a river that flows into a bay that I can see from the end of my road. A few miles the other way is a lake. We have A LOT of water).   Your ability to find work will probably dictate your initial living situation. What kind of places have you been applying? Can I help?"

And I'm at work here trying not to get too excited about actually sitting down and talking with my boyfriend about all of this.   I really didn't even think about Augusta, and I think I was on the bypass. Which is great because it wasn't all too far away from my house which would mean I could still go!

I miss Maine, and yes, even winter, in the worst possible way. I hate SC so much. It's too much here - too much traffic, too much suburbia, too much heat, too much everything. It's too Southern. I've come to the realization that moving here 3 years ago was the worst decision I've made in my life so far.  I've had a couple phone interviews for a job in ME, but am really hoping that I find something soon. I can't take this anymore, and if I didn't have a husband or children who depend on me for my financial impact (although small as it is), then I would just pick up and go tomorrow."

I have almost died just going to and from work I want to say twice a week since I've been here. I'm over by Hilton Head so NO ONE is from here and no one knows where anything is because the signs are too small and they hide behind bushes. And I want to say 80% are so old and frail they can't see over the steering wheel. And it's coming to be the time where the HUGE amounts of tourists flock in. I've only been here a few months and I'm already so bitter about the whole ordeal.   Good Luck with your interviews! I hope we both make it out haha

From there ya can just get a free 1 hour trial... if ya need more time just DC, spoof your MAC, and reconnect.

Maine,3acrrv,Ninjakick666,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:33:11 2015 UTC,"It depends on the node load levels for the specific modem, I got a look at the DOCSIS config file from an xfinity customer, the modem provisions X kbps for the customer and provisions another set amount for the xfinity wifi spot.  Going by the configs, they're fully separate, but if the node is overloaded then technically it could walk on the customer's speed, but that'd be noticeable even with no people on the wifi.   but I don't think you can spoof MACs on an iPhone w/o jailbreaking it.   Correct, but thankfully my wardriving laptop doesn't have such issues... and has a VPN connection for using dirty open wifi."
