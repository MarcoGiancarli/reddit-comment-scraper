Would you saying being a liberal makes you a sort-of radical in saudi arabia?   How do you feel about the saudi royal family? Do you think the next generation of rulers will improve things for your country?   Are you a muslim? if so are you devout?
casualiama,3e2gum,Apiperofhades,11,Tue Jul 21 14:24:34 2015 UTC,"I don't know how i became a liberal. my parents are very tolerant of everybody and raised me that way, I think that helped me have an open mind set to hear other people's point of views instead of blocking them out.  ""Would you saying being a liberal makes you a sort-of radical in saudi arabia?""  yes and no, there are many liberals in Jeddah and the Eastern Province of KSA. it's not like i'm alone in this. However we are still viewed as the big bad wolf that's corrupting minds by many people.  ""How do you feel about the saudi royal family? Do you think the next generation of rulers will improve things for your country?""  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds4nEz59oRw  Dr. Cox says my opinion on them better than I could ever do.  as far as change, the only way change happens here is like everywhere else. we need to be a majority agreeing on a topic to even start a fight for something.  ""Are you a muslim? if so are you devout?""  depends who you ask, I'm sure some Muslims would say that I'm not, I'm definitely not devout. I still identify as a Muslim when being asked. even with no gun to my head. to put it as a relationship status, It's complicated."
casualiama,3e2gum,Apiperofhades,4,Tue Jul 21 14:58:40 2015 UTC,"How do people serve their tea in saudi?   If I meet someone from saudi arabia, is there anything in particular I could do to them to be nice? Any knowledge about their country I can show off?   There was one american missionary who went to the middle east. He tried to give a defense of middle eastern culture. One thing he is said is that women have to wear the burqa in saudi. And he said you ask women if they're OK with it, they will say yes, because they can wear their pajamas in public and no one sees and no one cares. Is that even remotely true?"
casualiama,3e2gum,Apiperofhades,6,Tue Jul 21 15:26:57 2015 UTC,"A lot of Saudi's like Turkish samovar tea. it's perfect because if the tea is to strong you could add more water into it. But since I don't think you have the kit ready, if you ever have guests just ask them if they like it strong or not.  women are not forced to wear a burqa only the hijab and Abaya. and i'm sure the pajama thing was more of a joke than actual response. the truth is, many women in KSA are okay with it though. you could see that by the number of saudi women who're on a scolership program that still choose to wear a hijab. the problem is that the women that don't want to wear a hijab are forced to by law, even if they were minorities, they still deserve the right to do so."

casualiama,3e2gum,delta_baryon,11,Tue Jul 21 17:44:52 2015 UTC,"I would guess a Saudi liberal is vastly different than a U.S liberal. From what you know, what do you think? As a liberal, I feel that weed should be legal and other drugs decriminalized, women have the right to abortion, gays should have equal rights, and I agree with the social security system and economic support for the impoverished."
casualiama,3e2gum,delta_baryon,21,Tue Jul 21 13:36:41 2015 UTC,"Good question,  well I'm not the most educated in US liberal believes so I can't say for sure. But from what I know the foundation of the believe is the same.  About drugs, I do believe that self harm should not be punishable. For example, suicide is considered a crime in KSA and from what I've heard it's a crime in the US or at least in some parts of it. However, it's a non punishable crime in both countries. Even if the attempt failed and the person survived, you can't punish someone who clearly needs help not punishment.   But, when you come to talk about drug dealers, things get a bit out of hand and there is more than one variable to consider. What kind of drugs did he sell, what are the ages of the people he sold the drugs to, is he selling drugs only or is he also selling guns 'many drug dealers in KSA sell both.'  Women rights are what most liberals in KSA are focusing on today, it's a tough battle, but more people everyday are agreeing with us. We're taking it a step by step at a time. as you would see today, most debates are to let women drive. hopefully, we'll say change in this topic someday. If we win this, I'd hope we try to change the laws for women travelling so they could travel freely with out a permission for her husband or father.  The LGBT community in KSA are suffering no doubt about it. However, the current mind set of people in the kingdom makes it impossible to even debate the topic. It may sound harsh, but we can't do anything to help them today in KSA. I know that there are a few countries like Canada and New Zealand that took some refuges from KSA because they were from the LGBT community, that's the best deal they could get and the only advice I could think of to give them. It's sad, but it's reality.  I do not know much about the US social security system so I can't say anything about it."
casualiama,3e2gum,delta_baryon,5,Tue Jul 21 14:12:37 2015 UTC,"Suicide is a crime only so emergency services like the police can intervene to save your life. The police have broad powers in extremis to preserve life. They could, for example, kick down the door to your apartment and arrest you if they thought you were in immediate danger of self-harm.  A person would not go to jail for it unless they did something drastic and stupid like try to kill other people along with themselves."
casualiama,3e2gum,delta_baryon,4,Tue Jul 21 18:36:26 2015 UTC,"maybe that's the logic in first world countries where the police can't ""legally"" stop you without a reason. I don't know if KSA shares the same moral obligation."

If your asking about princes with political power, these guys are hard to get a hold of. It's possible to meet with one if you schedule an appointment and go through the hassle. I had no reason to go sea any of them and I hope I don't.  If you're wondering about younger princes, I had a class with one my first year in college. I don't want to generalize and say that all of them are the same, but the guy I took a class with was not in touch with reality at all. Everything that's considered a luxury to most people is handed to him. Even if we were able to beat sexism, racism and all violations of human writes in this country. we'd still need another 1000 years to beat classist."
casualiama,3e2gum,the_crustybastard,3,Tue Jul 21 13:43:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would take as long as you think.

casualiama,3e2gum,barakabear,14,Tue Jul 21 14:08:05 2015 UTC,"You assumed that it's just the parents of princes who hand them everything, when we drove to class we parked in the student's area, which depending on the day you might not even find a parking spot at the same parking lot designated for the building you have a class in. this sounds normal right? college students from all over the world go through the same. The prince parked in the shaded parking designated for professors, all he needed to not get his car towed is to write on the car who it belonged to. also, depending on the class at the university, you have a number of unexcused absences. if you exceed that limit you automatically fail the class no matter how your grades are. Do you think the professors would flunk him like the rest of us if he missed classes?"
casualiama,3e2gum,BraveSquirrel,3,Tue Jul 21 14:36:08 2015 UTC,"All of that is part of handing him everything. For him to become a better human being all of that crap has to cease or he will be a self-entitled jerk - oh wait - it might be too late.  I really feel sorry for regular human beings in that part of the world where the folks with the most to give and help are the ones least to do it. Yet - if they did give and help -- their world would remain VERY comfortable for generations.   If it continues like this. one day, the people will rise up and destroy the comfort zone that surrounds the elite. History has told this story many times, yet, people don't learn and are shocked when it happens to them."
casualiama,3e2gum,BraveSquirrel,4,Tue Jul 21 14:42:49 2015 UTC,"During college in the states here, we had a foreign Finnish guy who was ridiculously rich. First thing he did was buy an Iguana in a no-pets dorm, and that included the giant tank, the lamp and care stuff, and the giant table that it sat on. 2 weeks later during a check he tried hiding it with a small rug. It was confiscated immediately after. Right after that he bought a high quality BB gun and shot everything in his room until all the posters and boxes and everything were torn up. He got arrested and sent back home for shooting some police officers. It's a wonder he didn't get shot himself.  Classism is one weird situation."

My question is - how does religion correlate with political alignment in Saudi Arabia? For example, in America, conservatives have a reputation for being old, white, and Christian, whereas liberals have a reputation for being younger, more diverse, and although I wouldn't generalize them as less religious overall (without looking at statistics first), I think it's a safe generalization that religious rhetoric often plays a lesser role in liberal politics. Do more religious Saudis tend to be more conservative politically (and vice versa?). Do liberal Saudis tend to be less religious?"

You could say it's a good rule of thumb. However, I do have some friends who are very liberal when it comes to political believes. But very religious in there personal lives. I think it's a healthy mentality that they have, recognizing that not everyone must play by the religious believes they have. But in general, most liberals are not very religious in KSA."

I have a friend (acquaintance, really) from Saudi Arabia who is going to grad school here in America. She's on the king Abdullah scholarship- government funded I guess? Anyway, she told me that her brother or father can at any time terminate her scholarship, forcing her to return to Saudi Arabia. Is this really true? How can something like this be possible?"
casualiama,3e2gum,witoldc,5,Tue Jul 21 14:28:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't reviewed the laws for women scholarship yet. However, if she's not married her father (not her brother) can likely terminate her scholarship if he goes to the ministry of higher education and demands it. since she can't legally travel without his consent, I could see it being possible for him to terminate her overseas scholarship program. Sad, but it's likely true. on a happier note, educated women are more common and perfectly accepted in KSA today unlike 40 or 50 years ago. so her father terminating her scholarship  is not a likely thing."
casualiama,3e2gum,ttjclark,4,Tue Jul 21 15:05:34 2015 UTC,"How can something like this be possible?   A Saudi woman is forever essentially a minor.

Have a few really good date plans, your clients will generally want to be taken out, they'll pay for it but you should plan it. And you'll need a lot of backup plans in case a client just isn't interested in doing something, you need to be able to suggest something else right away. Then of course you need to be able to find clients. The internet is probably your best bet there. Then your execution just needs to be as good as your plan. If you want a client to become a regular (and the client wants to) you've got to give them an amazing experience, and give them one every time. They won't settle."

casualiama,3e3bud,SuaveMF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:51:54 2015 UTC,"Basically. They might have something they suggest or say they want to do and that's fine, but for the most part it's your responsibility to make sure they have a good time. That's what they're paying you for.  Most of my clients are women who want the date experience, but don't want to put in the time or effort of having an actual relationship because they just have other priorities. They want someone who can take them out, have a great time with, but there's no problem if there's no contact for months between 'dates' (and on the next date you'd better remember everything about her) or if they want to end it immediately without notice."
casualiama,3e3bud,SuaveMF,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:20 2015 UTC,So do you keep a notebook or something with all of your client's likes and dislikes?  Or do you just know them all well enough at this point?

There are two main options here...One, they're dumb, they don't know basic biology or two, they're lying. There's no reason to lie about it, though. I'll just go with the theory that they were ignorant of the differences of raising babies of both genders.   I've never pressed the matter further than that, so I have no clue of the mental gymnastics they went through during my childhood."
casualiama,3dyx43,Nabokovian97,34,Mon Jul 20 19:29:03 2015 UTC,"Also, most parents are known to repress, and thus ignore, signs that their child may not be ""normal"" or ""like any other child"".  When I told my mom I was gay, she was really surprised; later on she discussed it with a close friend of hers and she told her ""Well, I kind of always thought he may be"".

Also, schools do a terrible job of sex education, and my parents didn't contribute either. Even more, my external appearance did look pretty female to an extent - I had no reason not to believe I was female until I was flat out told by a medical professional.

I eventually got over it...not everyone does that, but I had pretty ambitious goals for myself and I couldn't do them while depressed about something I had no control over (hence the fighter pilot bit).   I keep it very private. Besides my parents, no family members know and I've told no friends. I figure it isn't relevant; they already have an image of me and disrupting it with a bombshell of a revelation won't gain anything for me or them. Again, since I've gotten over it I don't want anyone else to go through secondhand misery.   Who wouldn't want to be a fighter pilot? Haha. More seriously, I've always had a passion for aircraft and an unhealthy thirst for adventure. This, unlike most things, stuck with me through my rather unorthodox experiences. I'm doing a double major, both in STEM degrees, and I really enjoy it...I was always pretty good at school, so that's one thing that genetics hasn't screwed me out of. Even facing disqualification, I'll still try, and after that, I'll try for a waiver; after that, however, you're kind of dead in the water as far as military flight goes.

It worked out for me well because my choice was my own based on how much I enjoyed my life as a girl prior to learning of intersex, but other people being tricked like that is shameful - the patient is supposed to be the sole priority; not their parents, or their boss, or their friends."

Not entirely sure if that would apply to me, but I guess the procedures and the end result would be the same for me or some other person who was transgender (male to female, that is).

casualiama,3dyx43,Zygomycosis,3,Mon Jul 20 18:58:22 2015 UTC,"Besides my parents, no one knows; I prefer it that way.  I think my parents were just at a loss of how to deal with this. I mentioned in another ask that I think they're still kind of hung up on it even though I'm happy and content with the beautiful life I'm living now. I feel bad because they think I'm utterly miserable, but it's not true at all. Oh, and yes, they were supportive...supportive, but utterly clueless.  My dream job is fighter pilot! Very cool, purposeful, and driven career. If you mean dream as in ""never, ever going to happen in a million years"" then astronaut would be the greatest, but for obvious reasons I'd fail the physical and there are no waivers for them!  Uh, Interstellar was pretty good (recent), and I loved Jurassic Park (older). I can't pinpoint a favorite, the Lego Movie? Haha...any one of the ones I've listed are good. There."
casualiama,3dyx43,Thetawnygirl,4,Mon Jul 20 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"So, what's you sexual orientation? I know orientation doesn't correlated with identity, so I'm guessing you are (statistically speaking) most likely attracted to females because you were a male at birth. Right?"
casualiama,3dyx43,Zygomycosis,9,Tue Jul 21 01:51:45 2015 UTC,"That's a good question. A little bit of both, actually. I think if I were to give percentages of sexual interest, I prefer 60% female and 40% male. It's a strange deal...because I feel like attraction to women feels more ""natural"", as in, the physical reactions that would result (and that's to be expected of course), but I'm still not opposed in the slightest to potentially being with a guy either.   How in the hell would I explain my situation to my future partner? I'll cross that bridge when I get there, I guess...that's a tough one for me because I'm sort of introverted and bad with explanations.  By the way, I did have a few people have a crush on me during elementary, and a few dates in middle school...in high school I had one offer, but I had so much going on (clubs, AP classes, etc.) that I declined. I figured the follow up question to yours would be about dates and sex, so I decided to hit two birds with one stone."

The nurse must have confused it for female genitalia. I'm pretty sure when a baby is born they just look for either the dick or the vagina...they don't do any internal screening as far as I know, so it went under the radar because the nurse was lazy or stupid or something of the like. As I said in a previous comment - I kind of hope she/he was fired.  Oh, and I am going the Navy route!

casualiama,3dy6id,GwonamLord,18,Mon Jul 20 17:13:46 2015 UTC,"Of course the long term plan is to quit. being a functional alcoholic is a bit if a double edged sword as I'm not as motivated as a non-functional alcoholic to quit. It's always there at the back of my mind tho.  Always too drunk to care I suppose... Not really sure how to answer your question. I'm sure you understand that the reasons to stop are always present and are always known, but the actual stopping is... well... always an idea... but never executed properly..."
casualiama,3dy6id,nightowlgal,12,Mon Jul 20 17:21:50 2015 UTC,Yea... the non-functional alcoholic has less motivation to quit as their addiction has more of a control over their motives and their perceptions are less situated in reality.

casualiama,3e0506,TELL_ME_HOW-YOU_FEEL,25,Mon Jul 20 23:01:25 2015 UTC,"This was a year and a couple months ago. She's over at my mom's house all the time (where I lived at the time obviously), and she'd flirt with me a lot while she was over. I wasn't really sure how to respond since she's my mom's friend and was 39 at the time, but I always thought she was pretty hot and she was fun to be around and stuff, so I enjoyed it. At the beginning of summer break my mom asked if I'd go over to her place to help her with painting, since apparently I ""wasn't doing anything else"" since break started. So I'd go over to help her paint, and she'd flirt with me a lot and I'd flirt back, and on the second day I was helping I was getting ready to leave after I finished showering and she asked me if I wanted to hang around a bit and watch a movie or something. So we were on the couch going through netflix on the TV and she was sitting right next to me and before we even found a movie we started kissing, then she took me into her bedroom and we had sex.  After we finished I kind of just laid in her bed not sure what to do until eventually I decided I should go home. The next day she sent me a text asking if I'd go over and help her clean up the painting stuff, and when I got there it was mostly already done and we just finished up in about 10 minutes and then we had sex again. After that we'd text each other a lot, and maybe once or twice a week she'd invite me over and we'd have sex. I'm pretty sure she must have told my mom we were having sex pretty early on, because I went into my room one day and there was a box of condoms sitting on my dresser, and she seemed to know whenever I told my mom I was going out."
casualiama,3e0506,yaminub,9,Mon Jul 20 23:35:18 2015 UTC,I guess your mom feels comfortable with it being someone she knows and not some random girl only you know who could screw you over pretty easily.

Formally I havent gone to a professional, but informally ive spoken to a doctor of psychology. The conclusion was and remains that I know I am of no danger to myself or anyone else. That being said this has been an extremely positive experience, and has changed my life for the better. While contemplating my sanity, I looked to my time line of events. In each occurrence I had the experience, then found out what it meant. that was always extremely consistant with the experiences.     My understanding of a mental illness would have been opposite. I would have convinced myself i was buddha, then added reinforcing (possibly fabricated) details because i was searching for them. This shows in The main concept being that I had a dream of 5 astetics with no knowledge of Buddhism,  found out that my blankets name was in fact ""the buddha"", then discovered the connection between the events. When I read about buddhism for the first time I instantly learned that there is no such thing as a series of coincidences.  As well, I believe that if I were infact losing my sanity I wouldnt even question it, but it has been a lingering thought in my head that ive always considered."
casualiama,3e2n70,Conchobair,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:55:14 2015 UTC,See a psychiatrist.  They are licensed medical professionals devoted to treating mental disorders.  A psychologist can't do anything for you.  Don't try to diagnose yourself.  You're not professional and even if you were you still won't do that.  You should see one because you are showing a lot of signs of mental illness and are at the right age for those signs to start showing up.  Please do yourself a favor and get yourself checked out.

This whole experience has brought god into my life, brought me to corners of my brain that I never thought id reach, and given me virtues that I believe help me with my personal happiness. As I replied to someone else, I didnt play the numbers. Simply with the idea that I would win the lottery I learned how tempting greed can be, and that simply having whatever I want eliminated the pursuit of happiness. I didnt even want to try to win.

My question is, are even middle class black USians expected to talk/behave like lower class ghetto people?    Well, expected in the sense that it is kind of the social norm. My mother was in upper middle class by the time I was in High School. Generally, a lot of the black kids at my school ""talked black"" in a type of ghetto slang and dialect. Some are definitely to a lesser extent than others, but it is entirely obvious to people when a black person lacks one at all."

With everything happening recently I feel alienated from the opinions of a lot of people of my own race and they hate me (when I post these opinions online in response to events). Kind of caught in between as far as wishing there were more other black guys like me.
casualiama,3e1aa3,mcapello,2,Tue Jul 21 05:14:12 2015 UTC,"I gotcha. Sort of. As a white person it's hard to watch this stuff unfold, to sympathize with it and realize the need for change, but at the same time to not have gone through it, to not have the same experiences. There's a level of rage and feeling of injustice that I'll never understand, not having lived through it.  So imagine it's like that for you, but more complicated? Maybe you've lived some of it... but not all?"
casualiama,3e1aa3,mcapello,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:23:13 2015 UTC,"My opinions are case specific depending on what event we are discussing, but I actually feel the opposite. To summarize I feel in a lot of cases people jumping to conclusions and not being objective in some of these cases and riling other black people up has led to more racism and been counter productive.    I'll give you an example. Michael Brown's case to summarize. So you can watch video of him robbing a store earlier in the day he was killed. Police officer says he engaged in a physical altercation with him and reached for his gun. Now just being objective I definitely can't rule out he did that considering he robbed a store earlier in the day. There is no logical reason to immediately think it is racism to me. Yet a lot of people immediately cried racism. I just don't want to cry wolf basically. I want to see cases advocated peacefully because that's what civilized people do. I don't say that disparagingly but because I really want to see that kind of moving forward. I want to see black people shown a peaceful smart people, like the umbrella movement in China, not shown burning buildings on tv."
casualiama,3e1aa3,DukeMaximum,2,Tue Jul 21 05:58:47 2015 UTC,"Well... I hear that, but I think it's the pattern that's got people angry, not just one shooting or death in custody.  Of course that's the problems with patterns... they apply in some cases and not in others. Applying them before you know the facts is definitely a bad idea. So I hear you there.  As for property destruction, I always find this complaint funny, whether it's race riots or environmental protesters or whatever. People treat private property as sacred but police destroy property all the time -- of people who haven't been found guilty of doing any crime. They don't pay damages. In fact in some states (Pennsylvania, for example) they might even confiscate your property, sell it, and keep the money -- again, even if you haven't been found guilty of a crime. For a society that gets outraged about property destruction and ""thugs"" stealing things, there's somehow not the same level of outrage when people who should be held to a higher standard basically destroy and steal shit all the time."
casualiama,3e1aa3,Rhetor_Rex,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:17:02 2015 UTC,"Respectfully, whether or not the police do it is a completely separate issue to me and doesn't have relevance to the fact that I just prefer not to see my people doing this like in Baltimore. Because it looks bad, we just need to advocate our case peacefully. It's also because I know the people who are out there doing it are actually thugs who just want to riot and don't really care or understand the issue they're rioting for. I'm just being honest. It was a mob mentality out there. I mean there are gang members within the riots literally. People were out there to fuck shit up and rob stores because 'fuck the police'. I just think it drags us down, when we could use our minds to fight injustice wherever we may find it. It's 2015 and people are trying to send us back into 1965 . Not everything is racism and I feel like people are just riling each other up over things they haven't thought through objectively (in some cases)."
