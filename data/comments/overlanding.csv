If it's showing it's 10 year age with sagging springs and/or bad shocks consider at least replacing them with factory take-offs or something that will give you increased carrying capacity.  You really don't need or want a big lift and big tires for overlanding.  Stock to mild is about it.  As for everything else, a rack adds functionality, not a bad investment.

overlanding,3cxfzx,Kiriesh,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:18:56 2015 UTC,"Why wait for the warranty to expire before getting a winch?   If you're worried it will void your new car's warranty, don't. There are laws in-place to protect consumers and to promote business and innovation in the aftermarket parts industry. An article on those such laws and protections.   In short the aftermarket component/modification has to have been determined to be the cause of the problem. For example, if you replace stock rubber brake lines with aftermarket braided steel lines and later on your transmission starts slipping at 20k, the vehicle manufacturer cannot weasel out of a warranty claim on the tranny just because you added aftermarket brake lines. Why? Because the upgraded brake lines are in no way related to the early transmission failure.  If anything could be voided by a winch install it would be localized to your OEM battery and maybe the alernator.   Edit: bad link fixed."

The total comes on around 4-5 grand. A winch isn't my priority and would just make my already mushy front suspension more mushy while pushing back the purchase date of my lift and tires.

overlanding,3cmbtc,lredrover,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:08:06 2015 UTC,The suspension doesn't seem to have much travel and they seem to slip on Hills that I could take on with my stock xj but thinking about it it's probably just the camera that makes them look less steep than they are. From what I've read though good overlanding vehicle =/= good crawling vehicle so is the suspension maybe more tame for better long term travel?
overlanding,3cmbtc,nahfoo,2,Wed Jul 15 12:24:28 2015 UTC,"It might be familiarity with the vehicle. On my LR3 when I get beached in mud for example, extended mode bumps up the vehicle by another 2 inches over the offroad height. (Makes her look real angry)  But that only happens when the vehicle detects you being stuck on something, so you wouldn't see it too often.   It's a bit of a different mindset than an XJ, where you have solid axles and lockers.   As an overlander in my mind a Disco would be better than a Wrangler because of seating for 7, comfort, storage space.  As a trail rig, or rock crawler, the sky is the limit in a Wrangler, they're so friggin' cool :)  Mr LR is my daily driver as well and I have 3 kids. So usually when I show up at a trail the Jeep guys just look at me and ask me why I brought the schoolbus.  Good times."

overlanding,3cmbtc,ubsr1024,3,Sun Jul 12 19:50:52 2015 UTC,I really liked their first season with the US stuff.  I really liked the second season with the Alaska/Yukon trip.

I think they extra people they were referring to in the 'ten count' are the tacticool medical guys from that group they connect with while in Central America.  Anyway... I'm still digesting everything.  I just can't get past the brand new 2015 Toyota's they were 'given' along with all the RTT's, racks, lights, etc and the drawers and cargo management stuff.  Just seems like they are going the ""pay to play"" route and throwing money around --- even if it's not theirs and it's sponsors' money they are still throwing a lot of money around.  Still, seems like an epic trip and I will watch it anyway.  I just miss the ""good ol' boys"" vibe from the first few episodes."
overlanding,3cmbtc,sn44,2,Thu Jul 9 03:07:03 2015 UTC,They said in their video about their new 4runners that their film crew wanted to stay anonymous. That might be why. I don't know.
overlanding,3cmbtc,sn44,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:30:36 2015 UTC,I thought they were saying they were keeping their film gear anonymous when they were going over what they were packing.

overlanding,3cmbtc,WiretapStudios,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:06:16 2015 UTC,The could be keeping their video gear a secret simply to limit possible theft along the way due to border crossings and sketchy areas.

You never know what kind of hold ups you may face/endure.   Some people use whatever vehicles they have, and some specifically go out and look for their 'perfect' overlanding vehicle. They didn't just get those vehicles for free, they sacrificed time away from work and their families. I think it's great that they had a little payoff/perk along the way."
overlanding,3cmbtc,ABrownCoat,3,Thu Jul 9 03:41:30 2015 UTC,"So I got around to watching it, I will continue to watch because of course it's a cool trip.

overlanding,3c8z07,amateur_n1nja,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:07:21 2015 UTC,"Some will argue that the low air pressure created by the backwards facing snorkel creates less resistance for the engine to suck the air in, others say a forward facing snorkel creates a ram air type intake. While these are both technically correct, the difference is so negligible that there is really no advantage one way or another. That being said, if you have your snorkel facing to the rear when riding dusty, gravelly, or muddy roads in a group, you are less likely to catch and suck in any debris of significant size. Personally, I'm not taking my rig through any water deeper than my hood, so a snorkel would be pretty pointless for me."

I would love to have a diesel Hilux over my gas Tacoma (my current OL rig), but that just isn't going to happen.   However, if I was starting from scratch I would choose a used SUV. Something like a Toyota 4 Runner, Isuzu Trooper, Landrover and the like. The SUV ""body type"" allows for access to the cargo from within the vehicle, provides a level of cargo security and generally (not always) have a shorter wheel base than pickups. I can get a cap for the bed of my Tacoma, and I am considering one. However, this will also require me to get out of the vehicle in order to access just about anything stored in the bed. As for Van's, I am just not a Van person. They are cool, and I think it's great that some people love them, but they are just not for me.   I would also recommend a diesel engine, mostly for the range per tank of fuel when compared to gas engines. If you decide on a diesel, make sure you know how to work on it.   I would not use any vehicle without some shorter trips first to ""shakes the bugs out"". Every vehicle is different and sometimes (though rare) you get a lemon. This true even of new vehicles.   What do have is, a 2013 Toyota Tacoma, crew cab, short bed. This is an amazing vehicle and I couldn't be happier. Building it has been a bit of a challenge as it also has to serve as my daily driver.

I used to own some complicated diesel cars in the past years, all with all kinds of newer diesel technology and I did not had any issues with the fuel here, and believe me sometimes I had no choice but to fuel from some shady stations and yet cars run just fine.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-low-sulfur_diesel#European_Union  So far to store the diesel fuel I purchased these NATO fuel canisters from Latvia: http://www.valpro.lv/en/products/steel-cans/military/20l.html , I believe they are sold in other countries as Wavian but they are produced by Valpro in Latvia. They are built so well and are dirt cheap, at least here in Europe.  Please let me know more about the fuel stabilizers."
overlanding,3c3hor,-RAS,2,Sat Jul 4 23:56:36 2015 UTC,"Stabilizers... there are additives for just about everything to bring different properties to fuels both gasoline and diesel. You have (deep breath) biocides, cetain boosters, octain boosters, naptha based injector cleaners, detergents that removes carbon in verious strengths, winterizers, water removers, lubricity enhancers for better injector flow. (Ok. Its starting to sound like the shrimp scene from forest gump) anywho many of the base products above change advance timing which can be good or bad depending on how your vehicle is tuned. Being in Europe your diesel is a much higher cetain rating than most of our US fuels which would give you an edge on storage. However I advise you rotate your fuel if possible. From the sound of it you're not going near as large as my 5 ton /5 year stock. I fill from home and buy based on the market, sofar it has paid for itself in the first couple years and is pretty convenient aside buying and moving 1 ton / 300 us gallons home when prices are down and about to spike.  Anyways if you're really looking at letting your fuel sit, ""Stable""? ""Stabil""? I can't remember the precise wording but is a red colored additive, is considered an industry leader in keeping your fuel right. I have refrained from using it as it stains my diesel red..and red diesel is super illegal to use in the states as it is ""farm or offroad"" use diesel which isnt taxed. If its in a personal vehicle chances are you'll never get checked as they mainly try to target semi trucks and fleets. Still it is tempting though as it often costs up to 20% less. If you're planing on having over a ton stored at a time or do home fueling, buy a 2 micron filter that has a water drain valve on the bottom, your vehicle will love you for it. You'd be amazed at the crap that gets pumped up from older stations, especially the water sometimes, and water wrecks your Injectors in most cases. Another thing that most people don't think about when buying fuel to store or save money, preventive maintenance and keeping your vehicles running in top shape + slowing down a bit, gives you the most out of your stock. For instance I have my VW TDI... rated at 47 us mpg highway, cruising and steady driving at a mile a minute I would get 60 us mpg from stock. That is a huge percentage right there, but theres more, I started moding, and thats a rabbit hole indeed I have fallen down chasing mpgs, but anyways after adding simple things such as a 20$ flat belly pan, better therostat 12$, advanced the timing 5' when I did my timing belt (be careful to understand if you do this) added 10 more mpgs to 70mpg. Thats right 1350 us miles on a stock tank. But again theres more as I wish to travel as many of us do... TopGear in 2009 had ""project sipster"" a $7,000 70mpg 7sec 0-60 car...they ended up hitting all of that at 84mpg (where im aiming on mine) great read, highly recommend it if you're a gearhead. But that is just shop stuffs on stock cars. Go up a teir and you have VWs ""XL1"" at 260 mpg ford has a focus that is in the 200mpg range as well. Another step up you have the ""Acabion"" style and other aerodynamic motorcycles at close to 500 mpg. This is near the end of practical higher horse power. The final frontier are experimental vehicles, like the ""Pac 2"" car at 12,660 mpg equivalent (hydrogen). Just think... to be able to be free... ok I just realized I totally ran off on a major tangent, (thank gosh I didn't go into the political end of fuels)....  Clean your fuel with filters, rotate,  maybe add stabilizer if you want it to last super long, drive slow and enjoy seeing things (mpg), keep your vehicle happy, maybe look up cheap mpg tricks to get more out of your vehicle and fuel stock, go outside and see the world."

European Union of article  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel:       In the European Union, the “Euro IV” standard has applied since 2005, which specifies a maximum of 50 ppm of sulfur in diesel fuel for most highway vehicles;  ultra-low-sulfur diesel with a maximum of 10 ppm of sulfur must “be available” from 2005 and was widely available as of 2008. A final target (to be confirmed by the European Commission) of 2009 for the final reduction of sulfur to 10 ppm, which will be considered the entry into force of the Euro V fuel standard. In 2009, diesel fuel for most non-highway applications is also expected to conform to the Euro V standard for fuel. Various exceptions exist for certain uses and applications, most of which are being phased out over a period of several years.

overlanding,3c3hor,ABrownCoat,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:57:41 2015 UTC,"One of the downsides to diesel fuel is microbes. If any amount of water (which is almost aways present) exists in the fuel, there are microbes that can live and grow. A company called ""Bell Performance"" makes a fuel cleaner to remove this fungus. You will see a blackish film floating in the fuel, that is the fungus.   However, you can actually remove water yourself. It will sink to the bottom of any container and separate itself from the fuel over time. It is when it pools at the bottom that contamination can start.   Having said all of that, if you are only storing fuel in jerry cans (or like containers) I would cycle the fuel every 2-3 months. That is, fuel your vehicle from the jerry cans during a normal fill-up time and refill the cans [edit: with fresh fuel] at the same time."

This vehicle is not as capable as a Defender or a Disco but it will still afford you TONS of good times and take you to some incredible places if you treat it right.   Maintenance is HUGE when it comes to land rovers.  Stay on top of that and you should be ok.  I wouldn't go crazy adding a ton of parts, stick to the basics.     Decide what you're planning on doing with it and plan accordingly.  All terrain tires is a good start.  Many people get stuck and damage their vehicles because they don't have proper tires and lack of experience which can lead to broken parts.  Recovery gear would be next, a good tow strap, a good jack, shackles, etc.   Spend your money on going over the car first to make sure it is trail ready so you can avoid problems when you do get out there.    Fixing things on the trail can make for some good/bad memories depending on your outlook but the whole point is to get out and enjoy the journey isn't it?  Oh and keep in mind that the more often you get out there the more maintenance it will require.  Read your owner's manual to learn how to use your vehicle.  Other than that ask tons of questions!"

overlanding,3bpucx,Air_Puffed_Sugar,8,Wed Jul 1 04:37:08 2015 UTC,"For me, it comes down to balance, maturity and practicality. Most 4x4s do fine at stock height or with a very small (1""-2"") suspension lift.  Beyond that you are no longer building a vehicle for practical overlanding.  You are then going down the path of building a rock crawler or dedicated off road vehicle.  So given that, I feel that a quality vehicle with IFS should not be overlooked.  However, if the platform you are looking at has a solid axle, then great.  But we all know that a lot of modern SUVs and light trucks are no longer coming with solid front axles, at least here in the USA.  So really, you have to ask yourself, ""what am I building my rig for?""  General overlanding?  Intense overlanding in remote areas? Rock crawling?  Weekend camping trips?  If you are like most of us, and spend 80% of your time on tarmac, I see no reason to ignore all of the great vehicles that have IFS.  If you are planning a year long expedition through central Africa and you MUST have ABSOLUTE dependability, then it might be best to find a vehicle with a straight front axle for strength and simplicity.  To me a quality overland rig needs to be dependable, practical and fit the needs of the owner, before all else. If your idea of a quality overlanding rig is a truck with an 8"" suspension lift and a 4"" body lift and 37"" mudders, than you need to change your vocabulary from overlanding to a more appropriate term.  I have always had IFS rigs and I have had zero issues outside of dry-rotted CV boots.  I have a 2"" lift on my rig and I can deal with just about any moderate to difficult offroad trail.  But am also a person who does not go OVER it when I can go AROUND it.  And this is what I meant by 'maturity'. If you need to traverse from point A to point B safely and dependably, I do not think a solid axle or IFS should be the make or break factor.  It all comes down to the route, the driver, and what you want to get out of your experience."
overlanding,3bpucx,thin_the_herd,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:49:24 2015 UTC,Sound advice!  I can appreciate that thanks
overlanding,3bpucx,Taylordanger,4,Fri Jul 10 07:38:31 2015 UTC,All depends...  if you plan to mod your suspension to the limits a solid axle can be modded further for a lower cost.   If you plan on putting lots of miles with your overlanding IFS will be much more comfortable and will go just about anywhere with the right mods.  You need to pick different line depending on your choice but both will be good if you set them up right.
overlanding,3bpucx,lgrt,2,Wed Jul 1 04:58:51 2015 UTC,All personal choice. Solid axle will be easier for field repairs and IFS will handle bumpy roads better.
overlanding,3bpucx,Kiriesh,2,Wed Jul 1 05:04:02 2015 UTC,Solid Axle - less that can go wrong.
overlanding,3bpucx,bammad33,1 point,Wed Jul 1 04:53:48 2015 UTC,"Debatable, a coil sprung solid axle doesn't have that few less components than an IFS setup."
overlanding,3bpucx,Kiriesh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:04:35 2015 UTC,"No, but a solid axle allows for longer control arms which allows for reduced stress in some front end components. It also allows for easier modification in regard to height, and doesn't require a substructure for significant lift, as well as increased articulation."
overlanding,3bpucx,bammad33,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:12:03 2015 UTC,"No where states that control arms in IFS are fixed length. One of the first things a proper IFS lift should replace are control arms or you'll start chewing through CV joints. Control arms in a solid axle setup and control arms in an independent suspension are very different designs so saying they put less stress on components is null given the difference in components. IFS can be made to flex plenty as well, the only difference is cost, which is yet another variable in a long chain of non-comparable attributes. There isn't one inherently better system, it's all personal opinion."
overlanding,3bpucx,Kiriesh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:20:39 2015 UTC,Well for my $$ - anything over 3/4 ton should be solid axle.

overlanding,3bpucx,BaboonRockFighter,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:46:45 2015 UTC,"IFS or solid axle for overlanding?   Using your logic, I like duratracs."
overlanding,3bpucx,Kiriesh,1 point,Wed Jul 1 05:31:43 2015 UTC,"Solid axle.  I think rugged reliability is even more important in an overlanding rig than a toy rock crawler or mud bugger. The overlander is more likely to be further from home - your life may depend upon it (think Australian Outback) and certainly your wallet (towing or overnighted parts are expensive). Broken overlander can mean ruined trip (weekend or more).  I broke an IFS idler arm while overlanding out near Canyonlands NP a few years back. Was 20+ miles in and hadn't gotten to the interesting parts yet. i.e. it has all been just rough road at that point. Would have been an expensive tow if I hadn't managed to limp out. Decided to spend the money on a SAS for the peace of mind. Many more upgrades are available.  Had also broken a CV on Hell's Revenge on a previous trip.  Lifting IFS usually messes with steering geometry and CV angles, putting them under more stress. My lifted IFS handled about the same or worse than the completed SAS.  Solid axles usually have a bigger (stronger) ring and pinion. Better locker options.  Heavy duty birfields and u-joints are a thing. Heavy duty CVs are usually harder to come by (non-existent in the Toyota world - I think RCV are still working on it).  Up rated tie rods and TREs are easy and common on solid axles (e.g. 1-ton GM TREs on Toyota mini truck axles).  Most steering boxes (solid axle) will take more of a beating than the steering racks in modern IFS rigs.  Most solid axles rigs will articulate better (or can be easily made to) which can help avoid roll overs or getting stuck even on mild trails.  Don't buy the malarkey that solid axle rigs are bad on the road or handle badly."

I am not sure if needing that much flex is as necessary as something else like regearing / locking.  Speaking of: I presume that your new tire size is fairly larger than stock tire size?  If so, regearing will help pull your drivetrain back into factory ratios, or better.  This will bump your power back up a little.  Not sure on brand recommendations, though, as I'll probably be going with a small boost on my XJ."

The back end gets rubbing on sharp drops (i.e. coming out of the aforementioned steep driveway). Getting at least a couple more inches of room in there would be nice.  The new tires are definitely larger than stock (33"" vs. 30"" stock tires, if memory serves), and regearing is on my list of things to do as well. Thanks for that reminder!"

He went on to explain that he can't to technical stuff, but its still a 3/4 ton 4x4 dodge - it will take you places.  You can always add bags or install 3500 leaf pack. With that heavy motor up front the vehicle should feel pretty stable, just a little but more top heavy.   Had a coworder (surf hippi) that had a 05 3500 4x4 SRW quad cab 6 speed with a slide in. He would drive up some pretty nasty dunes and take some interesting angles to be able to get to the ""nicer"" beaches down near the gulf.

The only thing considerably worn was the ball joints but I don't want to have to crawl back under the thing every 4 months for the next issue. I've also upgraded the injection and lift pump so reliability isn't a concern so much as making it stable and capable off-road. That big ass engine acts like an anchor for the front end in soft terrain. So, as folks have mentioned, maybe the added weight on the rear will actually improve off-road performance.

I'd bet on the latter, based on those split front windows. They're made out of aluminum and have corrosion issues (see the diamond plates... could be preventative, but often the quick fix for the issue) and are powered by a handful of petrol V8s and a few diesels (the latter being better in most regards. Beautiful truck. I wanted one for years (the D90, the 2-door) but ultimately chose the Gelandewagen for many, many reasons.   Still... sweet rig. I'd like to know what that color is."

In my experience if you're somewhere you shouldn't be and it was a genuine accident (as opposed to not reading tresspassing signs) people are very helpful and are often intrigued about what you are doing. On some trips I have found people will not only help me, but often recommend other things you might not find on the internet or from a tour book. If you truly get lost, turn your updated GPS back on and follow it out, or for an even more exciting adventure play follow the power lines.  As far as scheduling - do a regular update with your GPS unit to determine how many miles you are from home, extimate your average distance/day and then give yourself a 3-5 day buffer to do some side exploring on the way back. I feel that if you make an itenerary and go into details about where you wanna be/time/date takes the fun out of it. Part of the fun of overlanding is just driving and experiencing. You need a basic schedule (if you are limited in time) as far as how far you can reasonably go and how long to get back, but going by the book to do what everybody else does just makes it like another suburban family summer holiday.

If you are going through Colorado, stop at a town with lots of trails around it, and give yourself 4-5 days where you don't have any plans, and tell yourself you aren't allowed to move forward. Then just start talking to locals about what the best things to check out in the hills around the area are.    Don't pre-plan all the trails you want to visit (maybe one or two).

overlanding,3bf3ga,Millsy1,5,Mon Jun 29 00:28:15 2015 UTC,"Probably because they would have still replaced all the features that get upgraded with the TRD editions. They added heavy duty shocks, new springs and better tires than would even come with the TRD."

overlanding,3bf3ga,Kiriesh,2,Tue Jun 30 17:23:11 2015 UTC,"Additionally to what the other guy said, you don't usually get to decide what you get.

Fuel mileage took a decent hit (~1 mpg) after installing it at its current height.   My tent is the fastest to deploy and the fastest to put away when I camp with others. Not so great for setting up basecamp, since I'm the only person who ever has to put everything away and lash all the things down before we do things for the day.  Comfort is unbeatable, though. I look down my nose haughtily at all the peasants sleeping on the ground. Pff, look at them, kicking rocks and sticks out of the way, and bending their stakes while they pound them into the ground with hammers and other implements of the low-born.  So what do you want to know?"

overlanding,3b8vqb,pt606,1 point,Sat Jun 27 05:05:24 2015 UTC,"What is the mounting requirements for the rack?    How big can the rails be?    Will it clear 1.5"" tube steel?    Would square tube be better?    What size?    Since I'm having a custom rack welded specifically for this RTT, I want to do it right the first time.    How much clearance do I need from the bottom of the roof rail to the roof in order to get the nuts/bolts on?    How strong is it?    Do you ever worry about it coming loose or falling off while out off roading?  Edit:  Formatting."
overlanding,3b8vqb,pt606,3,Sat Jun 27 13:09:43 2015 UTC,"What is the mounting requirements for the rack?   This is relatively flexible. The tent has extruded aluminum rails that run the entire 48"" length of the tent floor. There are 8 pieces (holders) that slide along the length of those rails that hold M8 metric bolts. It takes one pair of these aluminum holders, one pair of bolts, one pair of nylock nuts, and a flat piece of bar stock to mount the tent to one corner. Do this four times, and you've got a full mount.   So. The bolts can slide in the track to give you clearance for wider bars (you'd have to swap the flat bar stock, as well). The bolts can be replaced with longer or shorter bolts to suit your needs.   I would say the only real limitation is strength. The longer the bolts or bar stock get, the weaker it'll get. I'm no ME, but I'd tend to keep these pieces as short as you can manage.    How big can the rails be? Will it clear 1.5"" tube steel?   Yes, the pieces of bar stock that come with the tent have holes drilled into them with enough space to clear 1.5"" tube. Mine is mounted on 1.25"" tube with clearance to spare.   Would square tube be better?   It would be better for the tent, but I'd say think about that design a little bit more, since most other things that are meant to attach to racks are designed for round tube. If there's anything you wanna have made special, I'd say replace the bar stock with something that is meant to hold tight against a radiused piece of round tube, say like the large aluminum pieces of this Hi Lift tube mount.   What size?   I'd say go no bigger than 1.5"" tubing. Anything larger than that, and you're replacing all of the hardware that comes standard with the tent.   Since I'm having a custom rack welded specifically for this RTT, I want to do it right the first time.   I hear ya. Major consideration is weight. Figure 400 lbs. of people plus 125 lbs. of tent plus any other kit you bring inside with you. Design a rack with a dynamic load limit of at least 200 pounds and a static load limit of 600 pounds, and it'll do great.   How much clearance do I need from the bottom of the roof rail to the roof in order to get the nuts/bolts on?   Just enough to get a wrench in there and use it easily and so that the bolts don't mash against your roof. The bolts hang down from the extruded aluminum rail on the tent floor, so it's just a matter of getting the nylock nuts threaded on and tightened down. The more clearance you have, the better for when you're mounting the tent, though. The upper mounts for the rear shocks on my pickup truck are only accessible through a 2"" gap between the bed and the frame rail, and it was a major pain in the ass replacing those.   How strong is it?   The tent is strong. The rails are strong. The holders are strong. The bar stock is 1/4"" thick. The bolts are Grade 8. The Nylock nuts haven't quit.    Do you ever worry about it coming loose or falling off while out off roading?   I don't worry about it coming loose, but inspection of the rack and its components are part of my end-of-driving-day routine when I'm in the woods. That, if you're curious, involves checking fluids; eyeballing suspension, drive train, and all the associated boots; checking tire pressure; and checking all the crap that I bolted to my truck to make sure nothing has loosened up. I especially needed this after getting bounced around pretty hard in Lassen National Forest a couple of weeks ago.  Major concern here is height and shift in center of gravity."
overlanding,3b8vqb,pt606,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:54:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the answers!  This will make the build a lot easier.  I talked with my welder yesterday and the plan with the roof rack is to tie it in to the vehicle using hoops that attach to the top of the rear struts, and down to the floor next to the front seat side pillars.  Like a basic roll cage.  It'll also stiffen up the ride so it doesn't drive like a wet sponge as much.  I'm also going to have him build mounts for my (4) 7"" forward lights to bring them away from the windshield and limit the glare a bit.

My wagon isn't nearly as tall as most other trucks or trailers, would it be feasible to drill new set holes to match my ride height?"

I had the 1x4's already from a futon frame I took apart, otherwise I would have cut them an inch or so shorter. It will fit my Twin XL memory foam mattress (39""x80"") and has 24""x9""x80"" of storage space underneath.   Still haven't decided if I'll attach them all together or even to the bed of the truck. I built them to come out easily and stack into a 20"" deep shelf when not in use. I plan on installing an inverter, on board air, and battery bank under the front most section, and a 60"" pull out drawer for storage under the rest of the sections."
overlanding,3awwhr,Neon_Brown,2,Wed Jun 24 04:13:37 2015 UTC,Saving because I like the idea of separate pieces that could make a shelf when not in use. I have a couple questions though: Is it reinforced for lateral movement or just screwed together? I would think some aluminum angle in the corners would proved a bit more strength.  What about holding the sections together? Perhaps door latch hooks ?  Just thinking out loud
overlanding,3awwhr,saliczar,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:46:48 2015 UTC,"I used 2.5"" #10 screws to hold the 1x4's down, they seem to keep it from having any lateral movement, as a sleeping platform it should be fine, we'll see as a shelf. There are 5 or 6 screws on each side depending on if there are 4 or 3 boards on each section. I have enough of these strong ties to put one two on the inside and outside of each 2x10. But it doesn't seem to need them, so I haven't put any on. I may also wood glue the 1x4's down if things seem to rattle loose at all.  Right now to hold them together I'm going to tie them together with twine. I'm looking at eye bolts at each end with a wire and tensioner strung between them too. I might also drill the ends and dowel them. I think the mattress may hold them together well enough though."
overlanding,3awwhr,Neon_Brown,3,Wed Jun 24 19:21:05 2015 UTC,"I'd use these to hold them together, one on each side.  They are inexpensive, and easy to align.  I use them on cornhole boards to make them into a case for the bags."

Unlikely you'll need two and you can always go back for the trailer in the extremely rare case that happens. I would just keep a tire on the truck gate. simplifies the back of the trailer since you won't need a gate there.  Make sure that the tires and gas cans on the back of the truck aren't going to interfere with the trailer when making a hard turn. Looks like they clear but it's hard to tell from the picture. remember that they don't just have to clear when you are on flat ground but also when you are cornering while going up and down hills.   Last thing I'd mention is the ramp steepness. If you hurt yourself loading something in the sticks you are screwed. I'd get a set of folders that let you load more safely.  other that it's all details I'd think. Like corner jacks, tie down points, and a multi axis hitch.  Hope to see your build pics soon!"

overlanding,3acuus,Air_Puffed_Sugar,4,Fri Jun 19 02:01:15 2015 UTC,Sounds like you should consider a jeep Cherokee. Best years are 98-99 but they are all pretty solid. 2000 on had a head cracking issue if they over heated at all. Earlier had weaker axles normally. If you want more info /r/cherokeexj is the place to look.
overlanding,3acuus,toaster_knight,1 point,Fri Jun 19 02:10:57 2015 UTC,"97 had the stronger c8.25 just like 98,99 but it was iffy if you got the bigger ujoints up front in the D30. However a 97 and some trips to the scrap yard for shafts with the upgraded joint is also an option.  When buying XJs I always consider the 97 through 2001. But I'm also willing to replace the head if I buy a 2001 and I'm completely fine with swapping shafts for the 97 to get bigger ujoints."
overlanding,3acuus,Doctorphate,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:51:15 2015 UTC,I though the 29 spline was also an iffy one for 97. That's why I didn't recommend it.

overlanding,3acuus,toaster_knight,4,Wed Jun 24 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"An Expedition did the Vermont Overland Trophy a couple of years ago. Yes it was a little worse for wear afterwards, but it did it. Where you want to go dictates the size of the vehicle. If the places you tend to travel are wide open spaces, then a larger vehicle will be fine. If it's clogged with tight turns and trees, then a smaller vehicle is the better choice. You also have to factor in how much crap you want to take. I've always been of the mindset that the larger the vehicle, the greater the chance you will bring along too much stuff. When you are tight for space, you tend to be pretty mindful of what and how you are packing."
overlanding,3acuus,Overland_Odyssey,2,Fri Jun 19 04:40:41 2015 UTC,"Interesting and thank you for the advice. While where I am now is almost only fields, I'd prefer something that can manage lots of types of terrain. Do you think its smart to invest in my current vehicle or upgrade?"
overlanding,3acuus,Overland_Odyssey,2,Fri Jun 19 05:32:55 2015 UTC,"If your current vehicle is reliable and it will meet your needs, then using your current vehicle may be cheaper. If you can get away with saving money there it will allow you to spend more money where it actually counts....traveling."
overlanding,3acuus,mr_masamune,1 point,Fri Jun 19 06:15:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think there is one best vehicle for over landing. Every vehicle has it's pros/cons. /u/Overland_Odyssey said he thinks with a larger  vehicle you'll bring more stuff, which I agree with in a sense. I have a 1/2 pickup and I carry a lot off shit, but I'm also prepared if Zombies or A-bombs come into the scenario (well almost). I carry lots of tools and so forth.  My advice, drive what you're comfortable with. Having a mid-size vehicle with a shorter wheel base is usually favored on trails. I've been on some switch backs where I was a little concerned that my full size pick up might have issues making it in one turn."
overlanding,3acuus,thejunioristadmin,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:53:49 2015 UTC,I appreciate the advice. I'd want to change nearly everything on my current vehicle and an Expedition/F150 might be a good choice.
overlanding,3acuus,Doctorphate,3,Fri Jun 19 19:33:42 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest getting out in your exploder and seeing what about it you would want to change.  Thats cool if you just want something different but being able to quantify what you want is really important.    There will always be a compromise between capacity, being nimble, and in a lot of respects reliability.  Until you start to use what you have and identify where those points land on a list I think you really can't make a sound decision.  I've floundered between a few different rigs in the last 3 years and its cost me a chunk of money.  My needs and wants have changed as well during that time so it wasn't necessarily just me making rash decisions but had I taken more time think understand and think about what was important I think I'd gotten to where I am now sooner.  So I'll ask this...what about your explorer makes it not ideal for what you want to do?"
overlanding,3acuus,deprivedchild,1 point,Fri Jun 19 13:44:23 2015 UTC,"The biggest complaints are the transmission and engine. It's the 4.0L v6 pumping out somewhere around 140hp. And the automatic transmission is starting to get rough. Other than that, I'd want it lifted a little as well, maybe a solid axle swap. But size wise I do prefer it over the larger SUVs."
overlanding,3acuus,Tim_Teboner,1 point,Fri Jun 19 14:25:18 2015 UTC,"Consider Jeep XJ or ZJs. Similar in size to your Exploder and more reliable. ZJ does have coil springs front and rear which is nice for ride but it has the D35 rear which is junk so its a trade off. Personally I like the XJ, once you put an Old man emu suspension under it you're not likely to miss the coils."
overlanding,3acuus,thebrassnuckles,2,Wed Jun 24 14:48:41 2015 UTC,"Strange you bring up the Expedition--Pa and I are almost done putting the rebuilt engine back in, a 4.6.  Anyways, take a look into Toyota 4Runners. They're auite good, earlier ones based on a Hilux chassis and the later ones to the Tacoma, and they're a bit more compact than an Expedition. There's also the Nissan Pathfinder and XTerra.  If you're short enough, take a look at those. Unfortunately, I'm 6'2"" so I'll be buying a Frontier and a RTT.

overlanding,3acuus,thebrassnuckles,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:07:25 2015 UTC,"If you are going to be going on many trails, a smaller based SUV will be much better than a full size rigs. You can get a lot more places with a lot less worries.   Yo can pick up an 80 series Landcruiser for surprising ngl cheap nowadays. I paid 4200 for mine. It's now in 35's and geared and locked, but I love that thing. It's a beast offroad and it on road manners are better than that of my 2013 rubicon. Also, after all just took my cruiser with trailer on a 2000 mi. Trip if discovered many things I didn't know.  Such as, I don't need 35"" tires. 33 would suffice just fine. (Rick crawling background, 35"" tires are looking mighty small to me nowadays) I Don't NEED SFA. I Just want it. IFS would be perfectly fine for the sort of off-roading I do with my family.   That said, the 80 series cruiser is one of the most enjoyable to upgrade vehicles I have ever owned (I have owned a '98 wranger, '85 4Runner, 2013 JKUR, and my 96 cruiser.)

One had the 5.2 V8 the last one has the 4.0.  I'd still be wheeling my 4.0 if I hadn't found the LJ when I did.  That said...  Pros:   Coil sprung front and rear = great ride Optional 5.2 or 5.9 V8 if you want power, standard 4.0 Four doors and lots of cargo space, can sleep inside with rear seats folded down Sturdy roof, long, great for roof-rack Cheap = Easily picked up for $2,500 or less   Cons:   Dedicated $500 for a trans rebuild, not if but when Lack-luster aftermarket support, but it's there if you look hard Older pre-'96 ZJ's have quirky electrical issues"
overlanding,3acuus,Doctorphate,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:35:56 2015 UTC,If you have the AW4 trans with the 4L you'll never rebuild it for the life of the vehicle assuming you're not towing. If you are towing then a simple transmission cooler solves this issue totally. The AW4 suffers from heat when under stress unfortunately.
overlanding,3ac99f,RipSteel,5,Thu Jun 18 22:49:05 2015 UTC,"You can overland almost anything.  The key is to know your limits as a driver and know the limits of your vehicle.  Ian on Extreme4x4 (well, back when it was Extreme4x4) did a pretty cool rally inspired Focus.  That said, the three most popular platforms for ""budget"" minded overlanders are usually:   Jeeps - Cheap, lots of parts, easy to work on Toyotas - More expensive than Jeeps but usually more reliable Subarus - More economical as a daily driver   There is no ""one size fits all"" answer.  Ask ten people and you'll get ten, maybe even 20, different answers.  A lot depends if it's you alone, with an SO, with a family, or if you travel with a pet.  Also, work backwards.  Think about what you want your finished product to do, what your budget is, and what you can afford not only to build but to maintain as well."

Personally, I would stick with a Toyota or Jeep because there are so many aftermarket parts and a lot of material out for those two brands."
overlanding,3ac99f,Habitual0,3,Fri Jun 19 17:45:30 2015 UTC,"One other thing to think about is if you will be going to international overlanding. Parts availability will vary in differing parts of the world. Toyota, Range Rover, Mercedes are all global brands but Chevy may not be."
overlanding,3ac99f,toaster_knight,2,Sat Jun 20 01:57:44 2015 UTC,You could include Jeeps in the group of international vehicles. The XJ Cherokee and Wranglers of many years can be found anywhere you look.
overlanding,3ac99f,toaster_knight,2,Sat Jun 20 05:06:06 2015 UTC,The older jeep Cherokees are a good started  vehicle if you willing to work on them before you go out the first time. Most are getting enough miles that they need bigger items replaced like starters or seals.
overlanding,3ac99f,Kiriesh,2,Fri Jun 19 01:22:07 2015 UTC,"Speaking as a jeep guy, I've always seen Rangers as the underrated better suited budget option if you aren't planning on carrying more than 2 people (which most don't)."
overlanding,3ac99f,toaster_knight,2,Sat Jun 20 04:58:01 2015 UTC,Rangers are a great vehicle. In my experience cherokee spare parts are on the shelf everywhere considering most mechanical parts can be swapped with any jeep that runs the 4.0L motor. The aftermarket support and availability is absolutely stupid when compared to most other vehicles.
overlanding,3ac99f,Kiriesh,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:06:24 2015 UTC,"As nice as XJs are, you'll always have the ease of working on a body on frame design with a ranger, plus it seems much cleaner IMHO to have a dedicated sleeping area in the bed separate from the cab. Of course it all boils down to personal opinion. Both are great platforms with great aftermarket support.   Edit: autocorrect prefers jeeps."
overlanding,3ac99f,toaster_knight,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:11:05 2015 UTC,"Personal preference is exactly what it boils down to. I am planning to build a trailer for a RTT, kitchen, water storage and extra cargo capacity for my XJ eventually. I will then be able to change vehicles as I need to in the future without having to completely rebuild my setup."
overlanding,3ac99f,Doctorphate,2,Sat Jun 20 05:15:01 2015 UTC,"Where do you live and where will you be traveling is the FIRST question you ask.  If you're in North America, Jeep Cherokees are THE cheapest and easiest to get you into it. Once you have more experience you can continue with the jeep or move to something else thats more complicated to fix but better at different things.  As a toyota owner I would argue the Jeep Cherokee is MORE reliable than my Tacoma. However its important to research because the 97-99 Cherokee is extremely reliable but the 2001 cherokee isn't and neither is the 88.  Pick top 10 vehicles and research the shit out of them to narrow down the years that are best.  Personally I went from a Cherokee to a Tacoma and now I'm going back to the Cherokee for the simplicity.  /u/sn44 wrote a great write up but I wanted to just add that piece."
overlanding,3ac99f,ABrownCoat,2,Tue Jun 23 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"Toyota, Jeep and Subaru are the main choices in North America, but you shouldn't discount other options as well.   Some things you will need to consider are:   Base cost of vehicle Cost of ""upgrades"" Reliability Your skill as a mechanic Total budget you are willing to invest (it is an investment)    You can do anything if you the right combination of three components: Time, Money, Skill. The more skill you have the less money and time it will cost. If you have less time and skill it will cost you more money. You get the idea.   If you are decent with a wrench you can get more of a project vehicle. If you are not decent with a wrench, you should really learn how to be. The more remote you get, the less ""help"" will be available.   Having said that, some ""not-so-common"" options include:   Ford Ranger (decent after market and good reliability with a low cost in the used market) Dodge Dakota (Not a Dodge guy myself, but I have seen them on the trail and the owners seem to like them) Isuzu Vehicross (Run around $2k used and they are no longer made. Body panel replacements may get expensive, but the drive train from an Isuzu Trooper will swap out and there is an active online community for them. Watch out for the engines burning oil.)

One [minor] issue I have is that on the highways, the straps tend to kind of meet in the center.

overlanding,39l5dj,MrBoonio,2,Sun Jun 14 00:22:37 2015 UTC,I think what you are aiming to do would be a better fit over on /r/4x4   Overlanding is more about vehicle supported expeditions that are usually off-road but not always so we build for reliability and the ability to comfortably drive long distances instead of to just have fun off-road where it doesn't matter too much if something breaks.

I blame the Boy Scout mantra of ""be prepared.""  I really need to get better at not packing so much.   That said, given the nature of the trip I ended up packing a lot of stuff I would only need in emergencies (recovery gear, tools, etc).  Also, some of my gear isn't exactly the best so it takes up more space than it should (bulky folding cot, over-sized sleeping bag, etc).

I officially am taking a trip this summer (already have time off work for me and the SO so its actually happening finally) but for the first 3-4 days the only places along our route we can legally camp is at campsites. I've heard some of the popular ones get booked up fast and it'd be a bummer to get there and have no place to sleep."
overlanding,39awnq,Dlichterman,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:01:09 2015 UTC,"Since I'm traveling solo I've been using established campsites either in state/national parks or along state/national forest roads.  I've also tried to keep costs down by doing a little couch surfing with friends who offered.  Weather played a roll in some of that too.  The only ""room"" I paid for was a lodge in WV and that's because a nasty nasty storm was coming through with threat of tornado, high winds, hail, and lightening.  Wasn't going to risk tent-camping in that weather.  Plus I had already spent one night in my Jeep so I had saved some camping fees at that point so it came out as a break-even thing for me.    From the planning perspective I basically intentionally chose places I knew had established campsites and made sure they were within 200-300 miles of each other.  This allowed me to do some exploring between each stop as well as some time to sight-see along the way.  I planned for a few double-night stays in areas I knew I had a lot to do (NY, WV, PA, etc).  I hope that answers your question(s).  Please followup if you want any more info."

overlanding,39awnq,Kiriesh,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:13:38 2015 UTC,"Once I treated the fuel and sprayed carb-cleaner into the intake she was back to running okay.  Main mechanical issue I want to address while I'm home is I think the rear axle has a bad axle bearing or two.  Other issues:   Stock 10 year old suspension is overloaded Stock 3.73 gearing is inadequate for tires and terrain Quirky stock fuel tank only lets me put in 12-13 gallons for a max fill Stock headlights are inadequate for night driving in the mountains   I hope to address the axle bearings and gastank issue before heading back out.  Not sure about the suspension.  May spring for a budget-boost just for the extra clearance, but that will do little for the fatigued springs.  Just might give me more cushion before bottoming out.  Might also make the issue worse.  I really need HD springs with about 2"" or 3"" of lift what what I'm doing."

I had just done my lift and had my bike on the back of my truck on a joe hauler and it was scary to drive. Ended up with air bags in the rear to compensate.

Cool cars, just not very reliable and I would have trouble risking taking it on longer trips because of that."
overlanding,3905tx,HyperTraveler,2,Mon Jun 8 23:22:22 2015 UTC,"A guy on another forum I'm on did the Subaru engine conversion on his.  More than doubled the power, and I'm sure increased the reliability considerably.  To be honest, reliability was one reason I got rid of the Sprinter.  I had almost $5K in assorted bullshit with it in three years, and didn't really trust it.  Way to often I'd be on the road, start back up after lunch for example, and have something wrong with the van.  Once it started to rust, I was done."
overlanding,3905tx,mcthreadski,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:49:08 2015 UTC,"I love the Subaru conversion idea. I haven't looked into it very much, mostly because the only one I have really ever seen was in a Syncho that the guy wanted like $50,000 for it, which I am pretty sure he got. Do you have any idea how much the swap ran your friend?   I have heard that the Sprinters can be kinda crappy when it comes to maintenance, much like a lot of European cars, I suppose.   I still would love to get one of the original Toyota Vans with the five speed and four wheel drive."

Go straight towards the lake, when you see the entrance for the campsite keep going. When you reach the boat ramp turn left, its a dirt road and has access to plenty of beach front spots along the lake. Awesome camping to be had here!!!! before you get to the campsite, there is a road that goes right (west) from the entry road. Follow this road for a bit, after it turns back towards the lake, look for a dirt road to entry ""Clear Lake"" campground. Around 45.186547, -121.705414 This entry is a bit more difficult and may be impassable for passenger cars. Mostly find trucks and 4x4 camping here.

In other words, Toyota wasn't responsible for building or marketing these RVs.       Sort of like how the Citation Sprinter is built on a Mercedes chassis at the Thor Motor Coach factory and not at a Daimler-Benz AG factory.        Toyota did have a 1972 concept called the RV-2 which was kind of like a station wagon version of the Pontiac Aztec. They even put out some NSFW ads for it in Penthouse Magazine.

Basically l have lived and worked in some of the most remote areas of Australia's Tropical north for the last 30 years.Due to me being adopted by an Aboriginal tribe approx 15 yrs ago,l have a lot of access to remote areas normally out of bounds to most,because of it being covered by Aboriginal reserves or sacred sites etc and working with/on many other tribes country and getting to be known and trusted by them. l decided to custom build something l could use to see all the country open to me and more importantly allow my missus/kids to have some comfort while l did it.  I also wanted my kids to see traditional Aboriginal life in remote areas and to take some of the elderly Traditional Owners to remote areas they hadn't been able to see for a long time, as they were feeble or due to medical conditions.I have done half a dozen trips where we rigged up portable dialysis machines (aboriginals have one of the highest rates of Diabetes in the world)in the camper so elders could have a return visit to sacred areas before they died.  My missus and l share a love of Diving/fishing and hunting so l needed something l could easily tow one of my boats or a triple Quad/rhino trailer,while pushing my own tracks into remote areas.I own Toyota Landcruisers wagons and utes but they were limited on carrying space for our extended trips.I have had F100's but found with their over size for our Tojo formed tracks in the bush,l might as well just go to a proper truck platform. I built the Camper so it is removable so l can use the truck for work or the farm as well.As we live in the tropics l have a slide out kitchen l built into it and a outside shower all plumbed for hot water,the annexe is roll away and can be fitted with Mossie nets if required,we have done just over 60000klm's in the camper.That is my 5mtr fishing boat behind her, but it is more likely to have my custom built 7mtr Dive/Abalone boat behind if we are going into a real rough areas or my 4mtr Barra boat.This photo was on a trip up to the tip of Cape York in North Queensland for a mates 50th,he wanted the party at the northern most tip of Australia, so there was a lot of hard top so the light boat sufficed."

Your best bet are pre-CARB-ban cans from Wedco or Scepter.  I have three pre-ban scepter cans purchased two years ago that are fantastic and three Wedco cans I purchased 10 years ago that are equally good but they are metal and they scratch whatever they ride in and get scratched themselves so they like to make rust.  Other than that, both the Wedcos  and the Scepters are really good cans and I've never had an issue with leaking or rupture due to change in altitude or because they fell.  I also have the same number of water cans from both manufacturers and they've been equally performant for me.  Expect to pay about $100/can for pre-ban items.  You may also want to check and possibly replace the seals depending on their condition.  You'll also want appropriate pour spouts.  Edit: make sure, if you buy pre-ban equipment that you know when the cans were made.  If you buy post-ban cans, they may net you a ticket or get confiscated."

Overlanding is all about getting out to explore, it doesn't have to be 1000 miles into the wilderness to explore. So what if the jeep had to stay back in a parking lot? I still got out and explored areas I've never seen and enjoyed it."
overlanding,36xjnd,OGsuperthug,4,Fri May 22 23:06:55 2015 UTC,"Is this a pickup with a fiberglass cap?  That might work OK, but it's not going to be great.  Keep the whip as clear from nearby metal as possible.  Imagine the signal radiating from the antenna perpendicular from the whip in all directions.  The more metal in the path of the radiation, the worse you're getting out.    The whip of a CB antenna is really only half the antenna.  The other half is the body of the truck.  The magnet mount creates a (very poor) capacitive coupling to the metal body of the truck, and the metal of the truck becomes an RF counterpoise.  A firestick on the front bumper should be OK, but not great.  As any part of the body and grille above the base of the antenna may couple with the antenna a bit, and reduce your signal.  If the base is over the top of the hood, that will be better, but still less then ideal.   Make sure the base has a good electrical connection to the metal bumper.  Adding some ground strap between the bumper and the frame and body might help your signal if the bumper is not enough counterpoise.  The best location is as high as possible, with as much metal under the antenna as possible and also perpendicular to the base of the antenna.  Such as the center of the roof.  The creates a ground plane which will make your radiation pattern less irregular.  If you're only wanting to talk to the truck in front of you on the trail, none of this is necessary.  If you want to get some reach, a few small things may help.  I didn't want to hijack your thread, so I answered your question first.  how many people in overlanding use CB, and how many use amateur radio?  It seems to me that amateur radio can offer so much to overlanding.  For example, you could use 70cm band which means the entire antenna is only a couple inches high.  So less chance of it getting wiped off by a low tree branch.  You can easily push 50 watts into it (rather then 5 watts with CB) and using repeaters your range is going to be stunningly different kind of reach.  This only requires the basic license level, a test which was recently passed by an 8 year old girl.  If you're interested in a higher license level and larger antennas, you can get into HF (aka shortwave). This will give reliable comms a couple hundred miles without using repeaters or talk around the world when the bands are right."

overlanding,36xjnd,SnuffThePunkz,2,Sat May 23 05:16:44 2015 UTC,"CBs tend to be popular for inter-vehicle communications. Essentially if you're in a group traveling it's a very simple and easy system for people to communicate. Clearance for most antennas isn't an issue (aside from the 102"", that's just absurdly large. Most CB antennas are 4ft) as the fiberglass flexes more than enough for occasional low branches. Aside from that, CB is really not used much. Still doesn't hurt to have given their local range and the popularity of use in most off-roaders. If you get stuck on your own in a popular offroading area you may get lucky and find a channel an offroading group is on. Ham and the like are more useful long range but there's substantially less likelihood that nearby vehicles will have ham as well."
overlanding,36xjnd,Kiriesh,1 point,Sat May 23 20:56:08 2015 UTC,"With some out reach and testing sessions specifically organized for crawlers and overlanders maybe you can make it more likely to have someone on a ham frequency?  If you have enough people interested, it's likely that your local VE team (the people that put on the test) will come to your group and do a special session for your people.    I would think it would be a great emergency tool.  If you get stuck or injured, it's much more likely you can find someone on a repeater, then finding someone in simplex range on CB or any other radio service.    My buddy does some crawling, and he's had some LOW branches go by.  It seems lots of crawlers mount their CB antennas low for this reason.  There's no way a 4' Fiberglass is going to take the same abuse as a 7"" stainless whip.  This is A 70cm (440mhz) 1/4 wave vertical. They're  cheap too, in case it gets damaged.  Same antenna works for GMRS as well, which might be another attractive option, since it doesn't require a test.  However, the license is $85 for 5 years and you only have privileges on 12 frequencies.  Compared to amateur radio where $15 and a test gets you many bands including running some serious power on 2.4ghz for high powered wifi, and the very popular 2m band (144 MHz)."

overlanding,36r1m3,sn44,1 point,Thu May 21 17:50:06 2015 UTC,"I think most tire manufacturers say that you shouldn't air down, but yea I have gone down to 12psi on mine and wheeled for 8 hours and hit speeds up to 40mph while they were at that pressure."
overlanding,36r1m3,thebrassnuckles,1 point,Thu May 21 18:50:33 2015 UTC,"Good to know.  My opinion on the subject stems from when I witnessed one delaminate while off road.  I was told by someone rather experienced and knowledgable that it was due to being aired-down and the sidewall flexing away from the retread and thus causing it to delaminate.  This was roughly ten years ago so could be any number of factors as to why it happened (old tire, bad carcass, bad tread, etc).  It just left a lasting impression on me as a corner I didn't want to cut just to save a few bucks."
overlanding,36r1m3,sn44,4,Thu May 21 20:45:20 2015 UTC,"It's six of one half dozen of the other on this topic.  Either guys scream up and down the it's the worst possible thing you could ever do on par with drowning puppies.  Or they love them, Treadweight apparently is the best in re-treads and they do quality work for the value. Only certain brands are used, quality is checked first, no patched tires, etc. Etc.  The steer axle law was put in place for commercial trucks not light duty trucks, tons of companies run them on all corners of their work trucks. As do guys who DD and wheel.  It's up to you, the horror stories about re-treads exist for a reason. However on that point companies that do re-treads are also still around and thriving for another reason.  Sorry for being devils advocate, let the down voting begin."
overlanding,36r1m3,SnuffThePunkz,2,Thu May 21 15:32:00 2015 UTC,"The key for me is we're not talking about a DD for around-town driving.  This is an overlander.  If someone was asking about retreads on a work truck, sure.  If someone was asking about retreads for a weekend-wheeler, sure.  An overlander where you're vehicle is your life-line and your ""home on wheels,"" no, retreads are a bad idea.  Retreads have their place, and many of the companies like Treadwright make quality retreads for tires like BFG's.  That said, I still would never use a retread for an overlander.  Also, it should be noted you cannot/should-not run retreads at non-streat PSI.  So if you plan to air-down your tires when off-road you'll delaminate the retread from the tire.  Even a quality vulcanized one isn't up-to-snuff when compared to a new tire."
overlanding,36r1m3,sn44,2,Thu May 21 17:48:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not disputing anything that your saying, simply that they are not the devil spawn that most people make them out to be. Nor is it as dire as you'll making it. What kind of asshat would go out into the bush in an ""Overlanding"" situation and not carry a spare, or even two? Hell I don't go to the grocery store without one in my bed, anything more than a day trip gets my second spare rolled out of the barn and tossed on the truck.  That being said, do I run them? No, being North of the Border, the cost savings on the tires + shipping at the size I want to run (37-40"", still figuring out what I want) do not beat the value of Military take off's in comparable sizes.  As for airing down, that's a silly point, go to pirate4x4.com or other offroad sites. The guys there that run them air them down. Even review websites drop them to 15psi, and have no issues. Any tire manufacturer is going to tell you not to air the tire down, it increases the chance of failure. Re-tread or virgin tire.  Sure now running a low psi tires at freeway speeds is a sure fire way to have a blow out, or de-lamination. There is that risk with any tire. But on the trail your fine so long as your not driving a raptor, or going excessively fast."
overlanding,36r1m3,SnuffThePunkz,2,Thu May 21 20:07:53 2015 UTC,"I put Guard Dogs on 33s on my old truck, ran them for ~15k miles before I sold it. They were incredible off road (re: mudding/mild crawling), never got stuck unless I was high-centered. Wore real well too, had well over half tread left. I never experienced any problems with them. In fact, my aluminum wheel broke before the tire did (seriously, don't use this as a fact though lol).  You'll hear many arguments from every angle. I have personal experience on the road and off the road with them, and I'd go back to them again if the price was right (I got buy 4, get 1 free deal). I had to mount them myself, though, as no tire shop within 70 miles would touch them. They were HEAVY sob's, and you could tell when you accelerated. I think ~80lbs w/ air each iirc. Customer service was excellent as well, extending to the group I was rolling with as well. It's up to you; there are stories out there that rag on retreads, but there are countless others that aren't out there because no one had a reason to post them, much like mine.  Don't make the decision based on the cost; if you can't afford actual tires like KM2s, you can't afford the hobby. Look at the decision pragmatically. I live in a small town and the truck wouldn't be leaving it, so if anything were to happen, I had a plan. I ended up taking it all over the southeast anyway and they were great. Little loud on the highway, but I enjoyed it as a musical soundtrack of its own."
overlanding,36r1m3,dawgflymd,2,Thu May 21 19:36:13 2015 UTC,I would never use retreads on a 4x4 off-road.  a) you should never use retreads on a steering axle and b) retreads have a bad habit of delaminating when there is any side load on them.  -10/10; would not recommend.  Very bad idea.

overlanding,36mqwo,kg892,19,Wed May 20 14:58:42 2015 UTC,"The 2015 is a good year to get for the XTerra.  The model has been in production since 2005 and they have worked out the bugs from earlier production, so you shouldn't have any problems.  One of the weak points for the XTerra is the rear suspension - when loaded down it is prone to bottoming on the bump stops.  There are fixes for this ranging from helper springs, to add-a-leaf springs, urethane bumpers, airbags, or just total spring replacement (which is what I did).  That is really going to be the only problem area.  I have mine set up as kind of an all-around vehicle rather than a dedicated overland rig.  It's still my daily driver, tow vehicle, and Home Depot mule, so I have not built up the interior.  I personally think the XTerra is an ideal overland vehicle - especially in the Pro-4X trim (skid plates, off road lights, slightly better shocks, and a factory locking rear diff).  The IFS gives it comfortable and controlled handling on the road and at speed in the dirt when you are trying to put miles behind you, but it is still very capable of conquering technical trail sections.  The chassis is tougher than anything in the class because it is based on the fullsize Nissan Titan, Infiniti Q56 (which is the North American version of the Patrol), and the Pathfinder (before it became a minivan).  The chassis is absurdly overbuilt for the size vehicle it is - which is why I have no problem carrying way more payload than the official vehicle rating (thanks to upgraded rear springs).  At one point I filled everything from the back of the front seats to the tailgate and floor to headliner with bags of soil - and my X didn't care at all.   A few weeks ago I was down in Arizona and showing off to my wife's uncle who thought the X was a cute little toy - he ate his words when he saw what it could do.  In less than an hour I had climbed a trail he said was impassible for my vehicle (without using the locker) and ran 60+ mph up a dirt two-track while his pickup tried to rattle itself apart on the washboard and woop-dee-dos.  Actually, I'm pretty sure I jumped it a couple times*.    I know I'm biased, but I like the X for the manageable size, the clever storage, the easy to clean plastic cargo area, reliability, comfort, and cost.  Toyotas are great vehicles, but they are more expensive for what you get.  The FJ is capable, but has had it's share of problems ranging from breaking windscreens to ripping body panels.  It also doesn't have four real doors, the rear cargo door doesn't provide shade or shelter, and the visibility out of the cabin is horrible.  The XTerra has four doors, a top-opening lift gate (I lost track of how many times I sit on the back for lunch out of the sun or rain), and fantastic visibility due to the low shoulder-line.  At this point lots of people say the XTerra is dated - and it is - but that isn't always a bad thing.  The high shoulder-line on most newer models looks good from the outside but makes it hard to see the ground for tire placement and maneuvering in tight spots.    TL;DR - The XTerra is great value for the money.  It is capable and leaves you more money in your pocket for modifications and gear than a 4Runner while being smaller and easier to maneuver.  I would absolutely buy one again.  BONUS: Some XTerra porn.  Also check out www.thenewx.org - it's a great community with lots of knowledge about the model, mods, vendors, and so forth.  (* - Not recommended, but tons of fun if you have a good landing.)"
overlanding,36mqwo,SgtBrowncoat,6,Wed May 20 16:33:31 2015 UTC,"I gotta be honest, seeing your posts has me more than convinced, personally. And I thought I was a Jeep guy."
overlanding,36mqwo,TexMarshfellow,2,Wed May 20 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"I have nothing against Jeep.  My XJ was a lemon and suffered from poor build quality, but it is a completely different animal than the JK-series.  The JKU is probably the most capable out-of-the-box SUV in terms of (off road performance)/(dollar) - but that doesn't make it a great overlander.  To me the solid axle is a liability, especially given Jeep's propensity for the Jeep Death Wobble.  Having done overland trips with Jeeps, I noticed that they have a hard time keeping up when we are not crawling.  The solid axle makes them skittery and difficult to control at higher speed - especially on washboard.  When overlanding you need a vehicle that can handle the highway just as easily as fire roads and technical obstacles.  Overspecialization is actually a problem for overland, you wouldn't try to take a sports car or a rock buggy because they are too specialized at what they do.    The Wrangler is a bit like this.  Sure there are guys that overland Wranglers - I'm not saying it can't be done or that it is a bad idea.  This is just my personal opinion - the Wrangler is fantastic off road, but is a sub-optimal overland vehicle unless you plan your trips to need all that off road capability and have minimal time just driving over open dirt roads putting miles under the tires.  For some it is the right choice - after going IFS, I won't give up the comfort, control, and manners for only moderate gains in off road performance."
overlanding,36mqwo,SgtBrowncoat,2,Wed May 20 16:47:35 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree with you on pretty much all points, and I don't want a 4Runner, so if I did make the switch to a different SUV the Xterra would probably be near the top of the list. Especially with the Death Wobble on my JKU. It's pretty ugly.   Although realistically it's much more probable that I just get a truck and forego most of the overlanding ability for things like towing and cargo capability. I do much more street driving than any kind of off-roading anyway, and this is Texas. C'est la vie"

Now you need more cargo space and want to change things up?  No problem, put a rack over the bed with a rooftop tent and put your camping gear in crates in the bed.  Or you can go really nuts, take the bed off completely and have a either a flatbed or an overland camper installed.    Pickups are like Lego for adults."

overlanding,36mqwo,TexMarshfellow,2,Wed May 20 20:27:18 2015 UTC,"Humour me, what are the disadvantages of trucks and disadvantages of small SUVs?"
overlanding,36mqwo,Air_Puffed_Sugar,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"The lists are brief, but give an idea of some of what I believe to be disadvantages to both platforms.  I also included what I want in an overlander, which ended up being a lot more than I meant to type originally, and all of this is entirely my biased opinion.  Trucks:   Large wheelbase:passenger compartment ratio (and long wheelbase in general) Long overhangs = low approach/departure angles Limited offroad ability Poor gas mileage Little-to-no enclosed storage area Expensive   Small SUVs:   No seating for 6 Generally difficult to find locking differentials Weaknesses of IFS (except on Wranglers obviously) Small size decreases cargo volume (as does lack of a bed) Very low towing/hauling capacity  Lack of aftermarket support for some vehicles   What I want:  Barring the incredibly slim possibility of my winning the lottery and buying an EarthRoamer to add to my fleet, any overlander I owned would have to double as a useful/drivable vehicle on the street as well as a solid performer offroad.   The Toyota Land Cruiser 70 Series, in both Wagon and Troop Carrier configurations, would fit this quite well. So too would the Land Rover Defender 110 (long wheelbase).  Unfortunately, those are near-nonexistent here in the States, so they're not really viable options. And again, these have some of the disadvantages inherent in small SUV platforms, but their capabilities tend to compensate for that.  So my overlander, then, would have to fall into one of two categories: small SUV, or fullsize pickup truck.    If I were to go the SUV route, then the perfect vehicle would be something akin to the Jeep Wrangler Africa Concept (more info here). I'd want a JK Wrangler Unlimited platform with a stretched wheelbase and similar proportions to the LWB Land Rover, removable jumpseats in the back like LR110s, a fixed, load-bearing hardtop (the removable one is too weak and introduces too many complications to things like roof racks, and open air isn't really an asset when, say, camping in the desert), and a diesel engine. Basically a Jeep-branded Defender 110 clone, and I'm 100% aware of how shameless that would be lol.  The seating issue would be negated, as would the IFS/locking diff/aftermarket ones, and that would more than make up for only being able to tow ≈3000lbs. Diesel would lead to better mileage than a gasoline engine, and it'd be near-unstoppable offroad with a simple 3"" lift and some aggressive tires.  As there's basically no chance of me owning one of these either, a standard JKU Rubicon fits the bill decently well, and that's what I currently daily drive. Price: ≈$50k US, new, with upgrades (not the stretch/hardtop/diesel, just the regular JKUR).  A fullsize truck would be much easier to obtain and build to overlanding spec. It's worth noting, though, that what I want for towing is a lot heavier than most people need, although most of these are perfectly applicable to 1/2-tons as well. I'd go with a Ford Super Duty or Ram 2500/3500 with an 8-foot bed and a diesel engine. Both the Cummins and Powerstroke 6.7s are extremely reliable, proven engines, and both trucks come with solid axles, which opens up a world of possibility for strength upgrades in the form of modifications or even replacements. A simple 3"" suspension lift would sufficiently increase the offroad capability, and a bed cap/""topper"" would give me the enclosed cargo space as well as roof rack versatility. Although it'd obviously have to be removed for extremely heavy towing (>10k lbs), there'd be almost no situation in which a cap would be needed while on the road, the only place I'd be towing that kind of weight. If necessary, an even heavier-duty pickup truck (e.g. F-450/F-550 or Ram 4500/5500) could fill the same needs with a bit of modification, like this amazing rig, although that particular example sacrifices the ability to tow with a gooseneck or 5th-wheel.  This style of overlander would have a bit of trouble squeezing through tight trails or climbing rocks, but it wouldn't be impossible to do, and the poor breakover angle is just something I'd have to work around. A low-range transfer case and full locking diffs would help, and the larger platform means a lot more RV-style accessories are possible, which leads to increased livability and longer trips. Price: ≈$75k US, new, with upgrades."

overlanding,36mqwo,cacahootie,1 point,Wed May 20 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"Ive been eyeing xterras for years.  Couple questions:  how's the road noise on the highway at, say, 70mph?  When the rear seats lay down, is it actually flat for sleeping? Do the rear windows go all the way down?"
overlanding,36mqwo,tincankilla,1 point,Wed May 20 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"Road noise is entirely dependent on your tires.  Soft compound street tires with summer or all-season tread will be much quieter than off road LT rated tires.  With BF Goodrich All Terrain TA KO tires at 70 there is noticeable road noise, especially with the seats folded down and nothing in the back, but I can still use my BlueTooth, have a conversation, and listen to music without feeling like I'm being drowned out.  It put it in perspective, my Civic on street tires was louder by a wide margin. Putting the seats up and a cargo cover, or a cargo area full of gear seems to reduce some noise.  Remember, this is a truck-based SUV, not a glorified car on tall tires.  It depends how tall you are.  The seat bottoms fold forward and then the backs lay flat.  If you need extra space, the seat bottoms unclip easily (two red levers under the seats) and can be removed.  The Pro-4X also has a fold-down front seat, but it is slightly taller than the cargo area.  Many other vehicles get around this by just raising the door sill to cover the glass - this results in less light, poor visibility, and dark cave-like interior.  The XTerra's solution is just to leave some of the glass exposed so you can still see out - even if it can't all fit in the door.  The windows do not go all the way down in the back, due to the height of the windows (which give good visibility), the glass runs into the wheel cutout on the door.  Other vehicles ""fix"" this by raising the door sill so the metal door covers more of the glass.  This just makes the inside of the car dark and cave-like due to the lack of visibility and light.  The XTerra just leaves some of the glass exposed so you can still see out."

Evidently the freight company that comes out to the midwest has been notoriously problematic (I'm not the first with issues) but they've been great about working with me to get the parts and components I need. The tent itself it a pretty awesome piece of hardware. The instructions are abysmal, but if you call them they'll talk you through every last little step. And, compared to the price of an ARB or Easyawn, it's a no-brainer.   As far as smittibilt...I've got a few smittiblt components on my jeep and I haven't had any major issues...but I can see where the failing points would be. On a budget with light use they're fine, but if you're going to put you're gear through the wringer like most offroad guys do, I wouldn't trust it.

They steel other people's designs, make them in China as cheaply as they can, then hock them here through mega retailers like 4WheelParts which are more concerned with profits than brand reliability.  In some (very few) Smittybuilt has deals with the original manufacturer to have them make the product and allow them to sell it as a rebranded value product.  However, quality control standards are often loosened.  This is not uncommon practice.  The pocket flares on my LJ are rebranded value flares sold by Quadratec but manufactured by Bushwacker.  Anyway, anything manufactured in China is fair game for getting ripped off.  Just look at Rigid Industry's LED light bars.  They pretty much set the bar (no pun intended) for them, had them made in China, and them BAM - every tom dick and harry has a clone of their design coming out of the same chinese factories.  TL;DR: Friends don't let friends buy Smittybuilt.  Bonus TL;DR: Don't get anything manufactured in China if you want to retain your IP rights."
overlanding,36l91k,RESERVA42,5,Wed May 20 14:58:10 2015 UTC,"Rebranding is more common than most people think. My go-to example is batteries. If you rip off the label of an energizer or duralast battery, chances are it's going to have the same factory logo as a Kirkland (Costco brand) or like. Yet people pay nearly 2X at times to get the duralast branded. That being said, like you stated there might be decent factory brands but smittybilts are far too cheap to be decent."

Look at lockers for instance: ARB, Detroit and OX are all owned/manufactured by Eaton who also makes their self-branded lockers and limited slips.  Not to mention the megalith Omix-ADA who owns the brands Rugged Ridge, Alloy USA, and a few others.  Although there seems to be less-overlap with that company.  Goodyear owns BFGoodrich which is kinda funny when people get into pissing matches about KM2's vs. MTR's.  It's like two siblings arguing over who daddy loves more.

It was obvious they'd come in before the rains because their tires were free of mud and the spots underneath the vehicles were relatively dry.   What I saw get stuck were some 2-wheel drive camper vans, a couple of wagons and sedans, and a few folks who'd towed in normal-guy trailers.   There was a lot of vehicle recovery going on as people were abandoning ship and driving into Flagstaff to get out of the mire and get warmed up. Mostly, I spotted the same dudes in a 5-ton hauling all sorts of vehicles out of the mud."

For my own experience, there were so many booths to visit that we just couldn't make our schedule work to make any of the courses, though.

We have the NV cargo, and whip it around Utah/NV/CA/WY/ID/OR regularly. It's been a good rig, if a bit ""small"" inside. :)  Currently inside is a whitewater raft, and a lot of climbing gear. Still room to hang two hammocks, house the kitchen box, clothes, and the second row of seats. Can still stand, move around a bit. Plus the regular recovery gear, maxtrax, and all the other stuff that goes everywhere. I don't miss crawling through truck bed at all.  And, we put in the furnace which is FULLY AWESOME for winter and cold nights at high elevations, fall/spring trips.   I like the Nissan because it is different, V8, and it's been really reliable. I don't like the Nissan because I can't buy a locker for it yet, but Advanced is reportedly working on one. I like that the suspension is pretty stout up front. But, it's also heavy.   Maybe need to start an Adventure Van sub. :)"

overlanding,364by7,LittlePe0ple,3,Sat May 16 00:35:38 2015 UTC,Why do you have your snorkel pointing backwards? Doesn't that screw with your intake? I'd imagine that would create a slight vacuum when driving on highways
overlanding,364by7,kvnm,8,Sat May 16 00:39:57 2015 UTC,"I know that our UTV has both air intakes (they're high-mount) pointing backwards so that debris doesn't go into them, but it's limited to 25mph.  I'd think at higher speeds that wouldn't be the best setup but I don't know for sure.  Edit: I did some quick googling, and found this post on ExPo talking about the exact same thing.  It links to this post on the ExPo OP's website, which has since been deleted but is luckily archived on archive.org.  The top part is in Spanish, but they reproduced it in English below.  Not all of the pictures are there, but the important one (showing the pressure decrease) is.  Here's their TL;DR:   The results show that the intake system pressure drop increased a little over 55% when the vehicle was driven at 90 mph and 5,500 rpm if the snorkel intake was installed backwards.  In conclusion, just like we can wear a baseball backwards under exceptional circumstances, we can do the same by installing our snorkel intakes backwards in special conditions, such as when driving in jungle areas, where we wish to avoid tangling with branches or hanging vines.  Under other circumstances, particularly if we are driving at high speed, we believe that we have clearly demonstrated that installing the snorkel intake backward will have a detrimental effect on the engine’s efficiency, which will manifest itself as power loss and an increase in fuel consumption.   So /u/LittlePe0ple, unless you're driving in sufficiently heavy/dusty/muddy terrain on a regular basis, I'd recommend turning your snorkel back around."

I look forward to seeing your solution. And remember, aftermarket costs a shitload, but DIY gets you experience, customized design, and adds a personal touch and sense of pride. Also, it costs like 5x less so theres that.  I seriously recommend fabbing your own rack and mounting solution. I designed 5 or 6 different racks on paper for my rig before I drafted one that I was happy with. It cost $85 in materials and a day and a half of work, but I learned how to weld in the process.

overlanding,35urdc,facepillownap,4,Wed May 13 21:55:32 2015 UTC,"I haven't read any of Medlen's stuff besides that article, but there's a big difference between what he describes Krakauer doing - which is interpreting the limited evidence available to describe events to which there are no surviving witness - and what Greg Mortenson did.  He also literally says that he doesn't have access to some of the sources that Krakauer did while putting the book together, but assumes that, based on the evidence he does have, that Krakauer made things up.  Not great methodology.  I would genuinely like to read more by Medlen if he has some other writings that do a better job disputing Krakauer's claims.  Krakauer literally describes McCandless as ""rash and incautious by nature"" in the book, and says that he made a ""careless blunder,"" although there's obviously dispute as to what the careless blunder was.  There's a recurring theme in Krakauer's writings that a lack of preparedness in extreme situations can lead to death because of what would, in any other circumstance, be minor inconveniences.  He's obviously really convinced on the poison theory, but is it really that big of a deal that he attributes the poisoning to potato seeds and not hallucinogenic mushrooms?  There's not any more support that the mushrooms killed McCandless than the potato seeds.  McCandless was an immature, unprepared kid who paid the ultimate price for it.  That doesn't mean that nothing about him or his character was admirable.  The problem is that some people are idiots and can't discern the admirable parts from the stupid parts.  That people lack critical thinking skills isn't Krakauer's fault.  And I'm sure that people in Alaska hate Krakauer all the way to the bank with the tourist proceeds from people who come to visit Alaska because of his writings."

Even though I went from one Jeep to another (Grand Cherokee to Wrangler Unlimited) I didn't want to go too crazy on the LJ till I learned how it handled.

overlanding,35s0gh,jjallllday,2,Fri May 15 01:37:21 2015 UTC,"Oh I can't see 35s in my future. 33's already require a 3"" lift and trimming (some wheel well plastics as well as a body mount chop). 35's require a regear, lots of cutting with a 3"" lift or a 6"" lift (6"" requires cutting the front crossmember), and the spare can't fit under the bed. 33's seems like the realistic max tire size for a DD/overlander."
overlanding,35s0gh,jjallllday,2,Fri May 15 06:23:56 2015 UTC,"A lot easier to get 35's on a Jeep like the LJ, but the strain on the stock axles flirts too close with disaster for my liking. I do have a plan for something a little more extreme down the road, so 33's will be it for now."

Basically, I was getting tired of re-wiring things every time I added an accessory to my vehicles, so I decides to pre-wire a panel that's set up for 5 additional circuits, and wire that up to a switchpanel, so that when I'm ready to add new accessories, it's a one-wire hookup!  It's a lot like the SPOD module, just a little bulkier, and a lot less expensive, as well as user customizable, you could theoretically set this up for as many circuits as you wanted.  Everything is mounted on a sheet of Lexan (not plexi as most people assume), and will eventually be mounted in an enclosure before it finds its way into my Jeep.

overlanding,34vl9m,brilliantNumberOne,8,Mon May 4 22:48:21 2015 UTC,"Am I correct in assuming that the green wires are the ground for the coil side? If so, I would recommend not putting them in series like that. One bad crimp or broken wire could break the current path of multiple relay coils, and worst case all five of those circuits would be  rendered inoperative.  In my mind, it would be preferable to have five separate wires going to the terminal block. It would be a little crowded, but you reduce the possibility of multiple failures from one broken wire/bad crimp."
overlanding,34vl9m,beakergordon,1 point,Tue May 5 02:19:12 2015 UTC,"The green wires are the relay grounds, yes. The switchpanel will also be fed by one power wire between all the switches, so I end up with the same predicament on both ends. It's been bench tested, and all components are fixed so vibrations will be the only enemy, but if it does fail down the road, I'll have to re-design the layout."
overlanding,34vl9m,sn44,2,Wed May 6 14:37:48 2015 UTC,Something you could also consider for the green wires: crimp another wire into the far-right ground connection and run that one back to grounds on the terminal block. You would effectively create a ring; a single break would not be enough to cause a failure because current can always flow the other direction around the circle.

overlanding,34vl9m,maxillo,3,Tue May 5 01:57:53 2015 UTC,"I really like this panel. Very clean job.   The one thing I may have done differently is not daisy chaining the green wires , but running them individually to the terminal strip. That being said, you would also need a longer terminal  strip and the super cool terminal jumpers- so you don't have more than three connections per screw."
overlanding,34vl9m,LunarAssultVehicle,2,Tue May 5 02:30:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks! That point was brought up by someone else as well, but as far as space and design of the panel, it's too late to change now.

overlanding,34ruyd,SgtBrowncoat,2,Mon May 4 05:42:34 2015 UTC,"If you are on BLM land you can camp wherever unless its posted not to.  There are some commercial campgrounds in town with facilities and there are other more rugged grounds around the area.  The easiest places to access will fill up super quick.  If you want to rough it there are lots of spots 10-15 miles north of town (Gemini Bridges area, or 10-15 miles south of town.  Area BFE has a lower lot that allows camping as well.  As far as camping gear goes, June-mid September are going to be very very hot so you need to keep that in mind. Lots of water and an ability to get out of the sun will be key.    You don't say what you plan to do in the area but south of town there are the La Sal mountains that are higher elevation that I've also heard can be pleasant to camp in.  You'll have to do more research on that front though.  For suggestions on what to visit you gotta share you what you want out of the trip.  Crawling, seeing neat things, etc..."
overlanding,34ruyd,thejunioristadmin,1 point,Mon May 4 18:22:28 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the great response, I want to do some moderate trail runs no crawling. The out of the sun was something I was thinking about aswell and am getting a awning on the jeep. We dont mind roughing it so this is great advice. Scenic trails are really a priority so im making a list of all the trails discussed in this thread so far."
overlanding,34ruyd,thejunioristadmin,1 point,Mon May 4 20:13:09 2015 UTC,"One of my very favorite places to go is Onion Creek. Its very mild (except after heavy rains) but the BLM does a good job at rehabbing the road quickly.  My last trip up had 30+ creek crossings,  at the end you climb up to a plateau with some great views.  I've never done it but you can keep going and loop over to Polar Mesa and pop out on the south end of town which is an area I've never really explored. I may try and do that this weekend now that I think about it.  The Charles Wells book is considered to be the Moab bible by many here and is a very good resource. For ""not trails"" I like the Utah Benchmark Atlas and the Moab East and West maps. The benchmark is an awesome state wide atlas that has dirt roads/trails as well as camping areas and whatnot.  I think its also more reliable than a digital map.  I got the Moab east and west maps in town and they are nice as well.  I couldn't remember the name of another place I camped yesterday but just though of it.  There is a trail called ""Behind the Rocks"" that is very difficult.  On the way out there though there are some really good spots to nest up next to sandstone fins that give good shade in the afternoon. We camped out there 2 summers ago and to be honest it was quiet miserable.  The camping part, not the area, it was just so hot.  After a couple nights in the backcountry I moved to the KOA so I could get a shower to clean up and cool off.  I've since stayed at in town campgrounds that have little cabins.  They are pretty cheap ($40-50) and have AC and a place to lock up your stuff while your out exploring during the day. For early or late season camping I think you're fine in the backcountry but in the middle of the summer I just wouldn't do it personally."

And the vagabonds who abandoned normal life and don't mind not showering for weeks on end while eating rice and beans for dinner every night.   Most of us fall somewhere in the middle.  Most of us have median incomes and daily obligations and responsibilities.  For most of us it is a pipe dream!

The modifications and upgrades we make will reflect being smart with money.  Things like good tires rather than big tires.  Skid plates before a lift kit.  Snorkel? Not needed.  Winch? Not needed if you have a buddy and/or a hi-lift.  The trips will also reflect what the average person can do.  No trips across the Gobi desert for us.

When I was younger I was a boy scout and loved the outdoors. I hiked, rock climbed, mountain biked, canoed/kayaked, and camped - a lot.  I also worked in the outdoor education field for about ten years.  I got my first Jeep as a ""winter beater"" because I needed 4-wheel-drive while living in Pittsburgh.  I saw a Jeep as a way to nail two birds as one stone.  I would have the 4x4 I needed for snowy winters, but I'd also have a hub for my outdoor activities.  I saw the Jeep as a mobile base camp of sorts.  In time I got bit by the Jeep bug pretty bad and slowly I began Jeeping just for the sake of Jeeping.  Due to some health issues my ability to enjoy many of the outdoor activities took a major hit.  I was still able to enjoy Jeeping though and that sort of took over.  A few years ago I started an off-road photography business and that kept me busy most of my weekends during the spring, summer, and fall. While I was still outdoors I wasn't enjoying the same way I used to.  Recently I decided to return to my roots of being an outdoor enthusiast and saw the overlanding lifestyle as the way to do that.  I have always been envious of the expedition crowd but being on the east coast, and not having the budget for the expedition lifestyle I really never got into it.  As overlanding gained traction as the middle ground between 4x4'ing, expeditions, and the outdoors I knew I had found my niche.  This year I took over as the mod of /r/overlanding, which has been fun.  I also started an overland lifestyle blog with a buddy of mine where we're trying to promote a budget friendly approach to overlanding.  As a way to transition between my off-road photography business and the new blog, I have put together a plan to embark on the ""No Highways Tour"".  To be honest I was a bit tired of always taking photos of everyone else having fun.  I felt it was time for me to have a little fun of my own.  This trip will be through 12 states, over 28 days, for 3,500 miles of off-highway travel.  I plan to take all backroads and, whenever possible, unimproved roads.  Hope to his some cool places along the way.  As for the future, I have a book deal in the works for the ""No Highway Tour"" and few offers on the table to start writing for some magazines as a contributing author.

Add in the increased efficiency of the series-hybrid configuration and I can definitely see the advantages."
overlanding,34ahxd,OmicronNine,2,Thu Apr 30 03:50:54 2015 UTC,"There is theoretically decrease in efficiency with a electrical transmission vs a mechanical one. its possible that with the complexity of the hummer transmission an the 4wd system that it is on par, but unlikely. but the decrease in parts/failure risk and the increase in torque might be a fair trade for a 5/10% efficiency loss."
overlanding,34ahxd,Tora_Tora,2,Thu Apr 30 18:45:29 2015 UTC,There is theoretically decrease in efficiency with a electrical transmission vs a mechanical one.   I'm curious what you're specifically referring to.
overlanding,34ahxd,OmicronNine,2,Thu Apr 30 19:02:45 2015 UTC,"here is theoretically decrease in efficiency with a electrical transmission vs a mechanical one.   It wastes more energy to run gas engine to power a generator and then power a motor, than it does to hook the gas engine up to wheels via a set of gears. There are all sorts of reasons why it is a case by case basis, but generally speaking gears are pretty efficient."
overlanding,34ahxd,Tora_Tora,2,Sat May 2 01:24:09 2015 UTC,"It wastes more energy to run gas engine to power a generator and then power a motor, than it does to hook the gas engine up to wheels via a set of gears.   That's actually false. Gears may be efficient, but internal combustion engines are more complicated. They run most efficiently within particular narrow RPM ranges with particular loads, and their efficiency drops like a rock outside of those ranges. Electric motors, on the other hand, can be extremely efficient (and provide full torque!) at nearly any speed.  Running the ICE in combination with a generator means you can run it only within it's most optimal conditions, maximizing efficiency. Then you can take that electrical energy and drive an electric motor at nearly any speed with full torque to the wheels without the significant efficiency losses of traditional direct ICE mechanical drive. Even taking in to account the losses of charging and discharging the batteries and then driving the motors (all can easily be in the 90%+ efficiency range), it still beats an ICE only system handily.  You need to spend some more time researching hybrid technology, specifically series-hybrid technology."
overlanding,34ahxd,OmicronNine,1 point,Sat May 2 01:36:07 2015 UTC,"I am aware of series vs parallel hybrid tech. There is a reason that every hybrid car on the road has a direct mechanical connection between the ICE and the wheels. Including the chevy volt which is mostly electrical transmission, but still has a drive shaft for improved efficiency. Also note that there are very few diesel hybrids in production, simply because it is hard to be if you give it enough gears. Most commercial trucks have a huge number of gears to keep the revs in the right spot, the hummer has a 4 speed normally so maybe a hybrid would work, but only as a mechanical assist motor like a Prius or nearly every other hybrid car on the road. I highly doubt they did the pure electric transmission for efficiency. Most Diesel electric setups in trains and ships are for reduced complexity and 0 rpm torque not efficiency."

I am already bringing the trailer, so rather than pulling out a tent and assembling the tent frame I just remove the cover, putt up the tent and it's ready to sleep in.   I have to assemble to room for the extended room, but I don't always have to have it attached.   The extended room will cover the portion of the trailer that me slide out kitchen will be built so I will have a covered kitchen that is fully enclosed so I can cook in bad weather.   Basically the same reasons you would want any large camper over a tent. I love tent camping, but with a wife and 3 kids under age 5 it's a bit of a hassle, this will let us camp easier, with less stress."

overlanding,3400qf,iheartdata,2,Mon Apr 27 13:12:41 2015 UTC,"Serious question, why is there so much interest in roof-top tents in North America? Don't get me wrong, they're pretty awesome, but don't seem to have much benefit when you're camping/overlanding in areas without much risk from snakes and harmful insects.  I like to be able to setup camp, and then explore in the vehicle, or drive to trailheads, surf spots, boat put-ins, etc.  They seem to be all the rage lately, and fairly costly, as well as raising your COG. I can setup my backpacking tent in under 2 minutes. I'm not trying to be a dick, just genuinely curious what the big advantage is for them."
overlanding,3400qf,Kiddmen57,2,Mon Apr 27 19:36:23 2015 UTC,"I have mine on my trailer...dump the trailer and leave camp all setup while I go play.  My tent takes about a minute to pop up and has a nice thick pad, walls that block light, and I can keep a nice set of sheets and a pillow in there.  It's quite nice not sleeping on the ground anymore..though those ladders can be tricky in the middle of the night.    On top of a vehicle you do take a COG and mileage hit, but you can also park on any level surface and pitch the tent, no need for a larger area.  Some of the bigger tents can also sleep two or more people comfortably versus a smaller ground tent."
overlanding,3400qf,iheartdata,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:41:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply. I do see the benefit on a trailer as opposed to the roof, as well as leaving your sleeping gear setup."
overlanding,3400qf,aussie_jason,2,Tue Apr 28 17:36:48 2015 UTC,"Can you seriously fully setup your backpacking tent in under 2 min? I like to think things like that but when I actually time myself it takes a lot longer to do than I think. That is why a RTT on a trailer is attractive to me, especially when traveling with my wife when I need a bigger tent that takes longer to setup as all I would need to do is just pop it up and I'm done."
overlanding,3400qf,iheartdata,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:53:28 2015 UTC,"Yes. Newer tents with clips, in my case, the MSR Hubba Hubba, are extremely fast to setup. It's a hubbed pole design, so there is one pole with hubs and shock cord. I can set it up in the dark sans headlamp, and 2 minutes is more than enough. To be fair it's a 3-season tent that's optimal for the southwest(all mesh), and I rarely put on the rainfly unless I expect weather.  Now, inflating the pad(non-self inflating/non-thermarest style) is a huge pain in the ass."
overlanding,3400qf,Doctorphate,1 point,Tue Apr 28 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"If I didnt sleep in the cap of my Taco I'd have an RTT too. I like them because it takes max 5 minutes to setup. I cant see anyone setting up a tent in 2 minutes.   Its a personal preference though, if you dont mind setting up a tent every night then go that route as like you said its alot cheaper and keeps your COG down. But for those of us who are tired of setting up tents all the time every night we run RTT or sleep in our trucks.   I started sleeping in my truck because I didnt have the money for an RTT and didnt want to set up a tent anymore. Now that I've done it I'll have a hard time switching to RTT when this truck goes away. I love being in the cap. lol"

Ok ok ok, so you can't dump the CB as a lot of people still use it.  I went on a run and the leader handed me an el cheapo Chinese handheld ham, the very next day I ordered one from Amazon and found a testing center.  Take the practice tests, pass, get licensed, and enjoy crystal clear comms with much improved range.  I now have a nice dual bander (Yaesu FT-8800) and a half dozen cheap handhelds to pass out on runs.  I do have an el cheapo CB for those that aren't yet enlightened.  The main thing about CB is to use a good antenna and install it correctly, including checking and tuning the antenna with an SWR meter.  Even then, performance is lackluster.

Nobody's gonna offer that in a small-to-mid-size vehicle. Nobody. So keep looking for that brand new hilux or patrol. Otherwise, the vehicles are out there you just need to fork over the cash to pick one up.  Seriously though. This is inflation. I bought my 97 Wrangler for $13k brand new. 4 cyl, 5 speed, 4.11 ratio... the only options it had were the full doors and a back seat.

I Dont expect the same prices, but I can name off a list of vehicles I would readily buy brand new that are only available in other parts of the world.

One because it's a very polarizing topic anyway, and two because it's hard for many people who love the outdoors and the world enough to travel It, to shoot something in it. Also in many cases they see things through rose colored glasses when it comes to what people will do.   I think it's really all what you want and are comfortable with. If you live in big game country you'll need a big gun, or if you need a survival rifle a 22 works nicely. Some people, myself included, are more worried about two legged predators.   Personally I woulf NEVER use a firearm if there was another way. I think they cause more problems then they solve. That being said i still carry a 1911 in the field. The day you run into soemone or something directly threatening the ones you love, you'll be glad to have that final option.

They are admittedly rare, but they are out there and the last place you want to be caught defenseless is miles from civilization.

It's also hard to separate oneself from the herd of bloggers and other photographers just giving their stuff out for free (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Anyway, to make the book unique I've planed on a 3,500 mile journey down the east coast from Quoddy Head Maine (eastern most point of the US) to Key West (southern most point) all without taking any major highways.  Plan is to use backroads and dirt roads whenever possible.  I plan on hitting places like Mount Washington, Skyline Drive, the Blue Ridge Parkway, and of course a bunch of state/national parks and state/national forests.  That said, I know it's not purely ""overlanding.""  It's certainly not an expedition, but I think it's more than just a road-trip.  So... where does /r/overlanding fit in you're wondering.  Well, if you happen to live along the route (ME, CT, VT, NY, PA, MD, WV, VA, NC, SC, GA, FL) and want to join me for a day or two, you might just earn yourself a cameo in the book.  Doubly so if you can show me some local (legal) dirt roads and paths through your area.  While the trip has been rougly planned out, and I do have certain areas I want to hit, much of the in-between stuff is flexible.  I've tried to limit my scheduled drive-times to around 4 hours to leave time for exploring and detours.  So if you're interested, PM me and let's talk.  If you know of places and roads along the way I should hit, post them up and I'll see if I can fit them into the trip."

overlanding,339rfu,sn44,1 point,Tue Apr 21 03:20:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, not recommended.  A fiberglass top will fatigue and crack over time.  Last thing you want to happen is be sound asleep and come crashing into your truck bed while trapped in an RTT.  My 2-cents is to fab up a legit rollbar-type rack that come down to the bedrails of the truck.  Some people have used ladder racks, but those are usually thin-wall tube and not rated for much more weight than a few fiberglass ladders.  However, you can usually use them as a template to build your own."

Our goal is to encourage people to just get out there.  We're not going to get distracted with brand names or having the ""right"" gear.  We just want people to be smart, be safe, spend their money wisely, use what they have, drive what they have, and just get out there.  Our plan is to have a mix of novice-level tech pieces, gear reviews, and of course trip reports.  The one I have linked to is from a day-trip I made today.  So yeah, just thought I'd share since it's something I've been working on.  I'm open to any feedback you guys might have."

Gives you a real idea about how little things can cost."

overlanding,32uk6q,foragergirl,3,Thu Apr 16 20:51:38 2015 UTC,"Personally I wouldn't bolt to the sheet-metal roof.  Heard too many stories of loads bouncing, fatiguing the metal, and then causing leaks and/or the roof load ripping through.  I'd look into some kind of rack system and then attach the solar panels to the rack."
overlanding,32uk6q,sn44,3,Thu Apr 16 21:13:12 2015 UTC,"Congratulations!  You're the post that finally made me create an account.    Now, about solar panels on the roof, I've been thinking about this on and off again for a couple years.  There are a few issues that I will point out aside from drilling into your roof.    Most panels are rigid and will not take kindly to the rigid mount on a vehicle that will be bouncing around a lot.  Also, you'd have to space the panels off the vehicle a bit to allow for air to flow around them.  Solar panels do not like to be hot, as they lose efficiency.  The angle of the panel on your roof is only good for a couple hours a day to produce peak efficiency. I looked into the flexible adhesive backed RV panels and the cost is high, and they are HUGE!  There are a couple sites based in the UK selling flexible panels on a smaller size.  The issue here is that they mount directly to a flat surface.  Efficiency will suffer again from heat and angle to the sun. I've decided to skip hard mounting for now until a better technology comes out.  For your use it would be better to get a decent panel and a stand and set it up at camp each day, moving it to keep it pointed at the sun.  Then, use the vehicles charging system to charge peripheral batteries while driving."
overlanding,32uk6q,Kiddmen57,1 point,Sun Apr 19 00:10:49 2015 UTC,"Renogy sells flexible panels here in the U.S. that aren't too expensive, you can get them on Amazon."
overlanding,32uk6q,aussie_jason,2,Sun Apr 19 00:57:08 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't drill into the roof for the sole reason it would mean messing with your headliner and that is a huge pain, not to mention the leak risk. If you're driving you can charge off the alternator and if you're camped just fold out a solar panel, I have a Renogy 100W solar suitcase for just that purpose, it is quick & easy to deploy."

If you didn';t want to jack your original one up, I'm sure you could get one at a you-pull-it junk yard for under a hundred dollar bill. Then you could also put a rack on for a farm jack or other pioneer/engineer tools."

overlanding,32qv15,sn44,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:11:39 2015 UTC,Can anyone offer the possible science why these skinnys do just as good as a wide tire? I feel like there is a lot less drag in the horizontal especially if you need to winch out but you have less surface area on the ground. Basically I see it as the difference between skis and snowshoes. That being that skis are more efficient but snowshoes might give you the ability to carry more weight and be able to go anywhere just not as fast.
overlanding,32qv15,SMofJesus,2,Fri Apr 17 18:44:13 2015 UTC,"Skinnys put less stress on components, and give surface area where it counts (diameter is more important than width, when you sit down your footprint becomes much longer, that's where the big difference comes from in terms of traction), as well it puts more weight on a smaller surface area which helps with gripping and digging through loose surfaces to more compact deeper terrain*.   This is all from a very well made white paper by Scott Brady."
overlanding,32qv15,Kiriesh,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:16:07 2015 UTC,"Excellent article. I actually skimmed over that after posting and just re-read it. Consensus seems to be a tall narrow tire because it is economical aired up and has a longer contact patch that performs better than a wide patch. That last part I think is what people mis understand a lot but after examining makes a ton of sense. I see it as the longer patch has more leverage (traction!) that can power through rather than float over the surface. Basically, you really only need wide tires when you want to be able to drive on any surface of the earth in sacrifice of efficiency."
overlanding,32qv15,SMofJesus,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:42:31 2015 UTC,it has become harder to find good tall narrow tires as tire manufactures see sales of bigger more aggressive tires selling very well.  :(

overlanding,32qv15,lgrt,1 point,Thu Apr 16 06:24:43 2015 UTC,Keep hearing BFGs run small.  the 34s are more 33ish sized.
overlanding,32qv15,_none_,-2,Thu Apr 16 04:10:31 2015 UTC,Skinny tires can work well offroad but in soft surfaces like mud you're a lot more likely to sink since your ground contact area is smaller and therefore creates more pressure.
overlanding,32qv15,Tim_Teboner,1 point,Thu Apr 16 16:46:36 2015 UTC,"It all depends on the type of mud and the weight of the rig. In clay based mud, skinnies are superior on light rigs due to the increased ground pressure.  I have wides on my Toyota and will be going with skinnies the next time around. When skinnies don't work, the winch will."
overlanding,32qv15,L8sho,-1,Thu Apr 16 17:43:18 2015 UTC,And that is bull shit... You prob aren't ejecting the  mud from your tires  and that's why your slipping.

overlanding,32qv15,L8sho,1 point,Fri Apr 17 03:17:10 2015 UTC,I don't know why your getting down voted for this... It's true ..most of the time. The whole reason you air down tires is to spread out your weight and have more contact surface to the ground . That equals more  traction. The more thin tire will do better on ice and roads and hard gravel.

Speaking for myself, I don't need to drive my kitchen/gear closet/shower/toilet/bedroom up any waterfalls in Moab, but I would like to do some easy trails to get to amazing campsites, or have just one vehicle that can take me snowboarding on pow days, and be my weekend cabin on wheels. It doesn't have to be a Jeep. :) Just capable enough that I wouldn't have to turn around when there is a small washed out section of rarely traveled desert road.  Plus, with a long wheelbase, and at least limited slip differentials, there is a lot you can do. I have first hand experience with this. My 2001 E350 EB was lifted about three inches, and had a LS rear. It would go up stuff I could hardly believe. Flip side, my Nissan NV which is nearly the same wheelbase and weight, cannot go up the same rough road. Wheel slip, open differentials.  Ideally, push button electric or air lockers would be the bomb. On any of these vehicles. I prefer a tall top. :)"

The sketch above started on the back of a napkin this weekend and looks like it might become reality.  The idea is to build this out of black PVC so that the Baja sun heats the shower water as we drive.  We can pull into camp, string our hammocks and my wife can enjoy a not-cold shower.  After looking at shower solutions, I didn't see anything that was both practical and affordable.  My plan is to use the vehicle itself as part of a shower enclosure by opening the doors and surrounding it with our rain flys.  I was shooting for a minimum of 5 gallons capacity and am limited to 50"" of linear roof space.  That means a diameter of 5.42"" and a 50"" length.  Construction will consist of a 6"" diameter black PVC pipe for a total capacity of 6.12 gallons.  The ends of the pipe will be capped and sealed; at the bottom in the front will be a valve and hose fitting to attach a hand-sprayer.  At the top in the back will be a filler plug and tire valve.  My air compressor will be able to pump some air into the system to pressurize the reservoir.  Obviously everything will need to be built to withstand some pressure without leaking.  The tire valve will also be able to depressurize the reservoir when it isn't in use.  This whole thing will be attached to my factory XTerra roof rack on the passenger side.  No other gear will be on the roof out of weight concerns."

overlanding,324q9a,SgtBrowncoat,2,Sat Apr 11 19:00:09 2015 UTC,"Hey OP, I'm the guy you talked to a while ago about water storage solutions for that Baja trip I have planned.  Which sand ladders are you using?  Expedition Portal has a review of different designs but I'm wondering what you use and how you like them?  Thanks for the tour of your Land Cruiser, I hope I cross paths on the trail some day."
overlanding,324q9a,SgtBrowncoat,2,Sun Apr 12 16:58:32 2015 UTC,"You're also the catalyst for me posting this here, thanks. The sand ladders are military surplus PAP (Perforated Aluminum Planking) that were originally used as landing ramps. They come in 10 foot sections that are sized perfectly when cut in half and the locking tabs removed. I'm pretty sure these are what the Camel Trophy trucks used as well. Aluminum PAP is much harder to find than the PSP (Perforated Steel Planking) in the States (these came from Germany), but there are a few States companies who make equivalent ramps."
overlanding,324q9a,richbordoni,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:14:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help, I will keep an eye out for the PAP.  Since my sand ladders will probably end up on the roof, I want to keep them as light as possible."

overlanding,320d5p,Kiriesh,1 point,Thu Apr 9 16:33:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply :) for our trip from Germany to Kazakhstan we had a 1996 Volkswagen Golf III with 5 seats and 2 doors. It was definitely good enoug although a 4wd would have been better sometimes as we found out...  we only have our backpacks at the moment, so not much storage space needed and fuel economy... the less the better I would say... but we are basically looking for anything that isn't too expensive and brings us to detroit"
overlanding,320d5p,Kiriesh,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:28:25 2015 UTC,"I mentioned this in a different comment but I'll reiterate. I'd consider buying a small 4x4. If you purchase small (since it sounds like you dont need much space) it should get moderately good fuel economy, and offers you a bit more freedom to explore should you want to. Plus depending on what you purchase, there are may sought after older vehicles that are much harder to find in the rust belts so you may be able to get most if not all of your money back out of it when you go to sell."

overlanding,320d5p,Doctorphate,3,Fri Apr 10 13:55:36 2015 UTC,"If you can buy a reliable car for the same price as renting one, buy it and sell it at the end of your trip.  Don't forget that you'll need insurance, but you shouldn't need to register it or pay taxes if you only have it a month.    I met some Swedish tourists in Vegas, and they bought a $3,500 Ford Explorer in LA, camped out of it for the trip across country, and planned on selling it before they flew out of New York.  They said that if they couldn't sell it, they'd torch it, but I'd give it away for free before destroying a usable car."
overlanding,320d5p,kirinaz,3,Thu Apr 9 17:57:31 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about the rust free paradise of Southern California, but over here on the rust-plagued coast, you can get some pretty cheap cars - none of which I would trust as my transportation to work, much less through hundreds of miles of desert.  I'd splurge on a somewhat more expensive car like those Swedish tourists with the intention of selling it on the other end. Plus, insurance in the US (at least for US residents) isn't nearly as expensive as insurance in Europe."

I wouldn't want to be in the middle of the Rocky Mountains in a $1500 car and have it break down 100 miles from the nearest town.

You're better off renting something or spending more and then selling it. Spend $3500 and then you can fall back on Carmax to dump it when you reach Detroit if you can't find a buyer."
overlanding,320d5p,Doctorphate,1 point,Fri Apr 10 00:51:36 2015 UTC,Thanks for the offer... our problem is that we are already travelling for 9 months now and the money is tight... and having a risk of not being able to re-sell a 3500 dollar car for at least 2500 dollar is a bit too much...
overlanding,320d5p,jaeger217,1 point,Fri Apr 10 13:34:28 2015 UTC,"So here's something to consider if your budget allows it. California is a special case for used vehicles. The weather is ideal in 99% of the state for vehicles, so there is an abundance of great condition older cars. No salt from roads, not high humidity, its a nice dry heat that is perfect for cars. As a result, you end up with substantially better condition frames and bodies, as well as cheaper prices due to the larger quantity of older vehicles on the road. Detroit on the other hand, is rust central much like most of the mid-west. If you invest in a decent condition vehicle that is sought after (Jeep Cherokees and toyota 4runners come to mind) there's a high possibility to not just break even but to possibly profit by selling a collector vehicle from california to an enthusiast around Detroit. Obviously nothing is guaranteed but its food for thought."

overlanding,31reb4,BaronVonBullshite,5,Tue Apr 7 16:02:11 2015 UTC,The code words you are looking for is dispersed camping.  Call the area you want to camp at and ask about dispersed camping.  Here is the US Forest Service Dispersed Camping page  Have fun!
overlanding,31reb4,gemoose23,2,Tue Apr 7 17:20:02 2015 UTC,Thanks for that! I've been on the FS websites trawling  for info like that but never had any luck but turns out I wasn't looking for the right terms.
overlanding,31reb4,aussie_jason,2,Tue Apr 7 18:05:14 2015 UTC,I'm always all over that site all the time and never ran across that Dispersed Camping Page before.  Thanks for the link.
overlanding,31reb4,lgrt,2,Wed Apr 8 04:01:45 2015 UTC,"OHV just means Off Highway Vehicle and tends to refer to ATV's that aren't street legal, often this means 4x4's are also welcome but here in TX it usually doesn't so our offroading on public lands is quite limited, you also typically need to purchase an OHV decal for such areas.  Unfortunately in my opinion the U.S. just isn't very overlanding friendly as it isn't easy to find spots where you can just pull up and setup camp at your vehicle. Some parks allow it like Martin Dies Jr State Park here but it isn't a feature they advertise so it isn't easy to find parks that do. There are also the National Forests and Wilderness Areas where camping is fairly open but usually with the provision that you setup camp a set distance away from the road/trail so that rules out a traditional overland camp."
overlanding,31reb4,aussie_jason,2,Tue Apr 7 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"I think if you can find some BLM land you can just camp anywhere. If you're on National Forrest though, you have to use a 'designated' site."
overlanding,31reb4,mr_masamune,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:39:46 2015 UTC,It must vary by NF then as in Sam Houston as long as it isn't hunting season then we can camp anywhere as long as it is off trail and not too close to water sources.
overlanding,31reb4,aussie_jason,2,Tue Apr 7 16:45:36 2015 UTC,"If it seems confusing, replace ""overlanding"" with ""car camping"" or ""road tripping"". Some will say there are limitations to definitions but at the end of the day as long as you enjoy it definitions be damned. Camping varies from location to location. If you plan to sleep in the vehicle it allows for more options of ""outlaw camping"" I.e. Just parking and sleeping even if you're not at a campsite if you're on the road and need to sleep."
overlanding,31reb4,Kiriesh,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:16:42 2015 UTC,"When do you plan on going?   I have been quite a few times to both parks and all in between in June-Aug and can tell ya just about everything.     First off... last year we were in the badlands July 2-3 and could not get a spot in the park.  There are two campgrounds, with one being at the south entrance and has facilities and the other is down the dirt road and has no facilities.  When we came in Jul 1 at 1PM, all spots in the primitive campground were taken. :(  Same goes for 1:45 at the other campground by the restaurant.  We ended up staying at the KOA...(Yikes $$$) for the two nights that is right down the road and actually really nice.  We were just wondering and went to see on July 3rd and everything was full by 10 AM.    Glacier, Devils Tower, the rest of Custer State Park, and Yellowstone were all the same.  In Glacier we stayed outside of the park as Everything was full at 9 am.   We got lucky going into Yellowstone and literally got the last spot in the park at the campground just north of the Teton boarder.   We drove in hoping and went to the station and paid without looking at the spot and it turned out to be the last spot in Yellowstone.  This was 10 AM.  Make your reservations or you will be spending $$$ at private campgrounds.  It isn't like it was 20 years ago... all of those parks are PACKED!!!"

overlanding,30z7ik,AltoidPounder,2,Wed Apr 1 15:13:39 2015 UTC,With the water tank full and a full tank of propane on the trailer all full does it not end up being front heavy? seems like most of the weight is forward of the axle.
overlanding,30z7ik,Megas1xlr,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:15:52 2015 UTC,Actually due to the axle placement and the weight of the tire and tire carrier it probably needs a little more weight in the front.  I try to keep the water tank pretty full for that reason.  I may also add another deep cycle battery inside close to the front to front load it a little more (and obviously to double the battery life).

I have traveled solo to the arctic ocean in Alaska and Inuvik, Canada as well as down the complete length of Baja.  This game is really to challenge us all to think about what we carry and why.  If we carry a couple of single use item, can they be replaced by a multi-use item.  Far too often I see trucks over loaded with every piece of gear.  Most all recovery gear has it place. But it is far too easy to keep adding to the kit rather than think through if another tool we have could work or should we drop a tool in place of a new one.  I equate recovery skill to driving skill in general.  When you see a really good driver work a 2wd truck through an area many 4wd trucks had trouble you understand most of it is driver.  The same is true when you watch someone who really knows recovery and can assess a stuck situation, make a plan based on available gear and execute to get the truck unstuck.  It is always good to challenge our thought process about what we bring, why we are bringing it and what we would do if we forgot it..."

overlanding,30od6l,Kiriesh,2,Sun Mar 29 16:49:30 2015 UTC,I know your pain. My jeep gets 13 mpg hwy if I'm lucky and my dodge averages around 11 combined. I was looking into tundras for a while but on 35's they usually get low teens hwy and single digits city. If you were buying a truck from the 90's I'd expect that but that's a let down personally for a modern vehicle.
overlanding,30od6l,Doctorphate,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:11:22 2015 UTC,That's a good point. That's really bad economy
overlanding,30od6l,Kiriesh,2,Sun Mar 29 23:28:03 2015 UTC,My issue is that Toyota fans seem to be pretty oblivious to their faults such as repair COST. 2grand for this wiring harness is going to hurt quite badly in the tacoma.
overlanding,30od6l,Doctorphate,3,Mon Mar 30 17:11:50 2015 UTC,"Anybody who is a ""diehard fan"" of any brand is going to claim that theirs is the best regardless of what issues they have. Its blind faith in a name that is the root issue, regardless of the name."
overlanding,30od6l,Kiriesh,0,Sun Mar 29 17:04:50 2015 UTC,"I agree, As a jeep fan I see it all the time with Jeep guys. Refusing to believe that its not normal for vehicles to get death wobble above 80km/h. Come on guys, you shouldn't be at risk of dying above 80km/h. Or pretending the Dana35 is a great axle. lol"
overlanding,30od6l,Doctorphate,2,Mon Mar 30 00:55:33 2015 UTC,"I see it from both sides, as a tacoma and wrangler fan. Personally I think die hard wrangler and land cruiser guys are the worst. I don't favor one brand over another, I simply like the body styling of certain vehicles. Everything has its flaws, if there was a perfect vehicle on the road everybody would own one. Sometimes people need to get their heads out of their asses long enough to realize that there is no definite right answer."
overlanding,30od6l,Kiriesh,0,Mon Mar 30 01:25:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed. That being said, my Tacoma I'm thinking is more of a pain in the ass than its worth at this point. I'll either convert my Ranger for overland use or pick up another Jeep Cherokee(my personal favourite jeep for overland travel, or grand cherokee)"
overlanding,30od6l,brilliantNumberOne,2,Mon Mar 30 01:34:05 2015 UTC,"The only issue I see with a ranger personally is the lack of a back seat and lack of aftermarket (compared to a taco). I'm a 4 door vehicle kinda guy so a taco is one of my only options. XJs are great, of course they're a different beast all together."
overlanding,30od6l,Doctorphate,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:37:22 2015 UTC,"Indeed, however I'm not able to have kids anyway so it being a 2 door isn't that big of a deal. The back is generally used for food storage and a spot for my dog to sleep.  XJs are sweet, but the unibody is problematic with rust issues we get up here in Canada. Right now I'm open to an XJ, ZJ, WJ or using my current ford ranger.  Not worried about aftermarket as I tend to fabricate things myself, and there is a big aftermarket however its more towards prerunning."
overlanding,30od6l,mind_maze,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:42:00 2015 UTC,I feel like any vehicle is going to have rust issues if you live somewhere with heavy salting. Personally if I had the choice I'd go for a diesel WK. Certainly not as popular of a choice but a diesel mpg combined with the onroad manners of IFS seems like a good combo to me. Of course that's all just what you want out of the vehicle. Dear lord kids aren't an issue for me and I hope not for a long time being 19 and a full time college student. I just like having interior space and the ability to carry friends/ my dog with me on trips. If you're up to either ponying up for shipping or traveling I know you can buy any of those older jeeps for fractions of the price up north around where I live (California) and rust is practically a non-issue.
overlanding,30od6l,Doctorphate,1 point,Mon Mar 30 01:49:45 2015 UTC,"What year is your Tacoma?  Although I don't really do any offroading (2WD), I have a '97 Nissan D21 pickup, and I love its small size (despite my 6'3 stature). The wheelbase is only about a foot longer than a Miata."
overlanding,30od6l,lgrt,2,Mon Mar 30 01:55:06 2015 UTC,"I have a 2006 Tacoma, 4x4 long box and 4 door. Shes rather long but its the width thats annoying. I have quite a few scratches."
overlanding,30od6l,Doctorphate,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:28:05 2015 UTC,What kinda repair bills man?
overlanding,30od6l,Imbuere,2,Sun Mar 29 15:33:47 2015 UTC,"Well the sensor in my automatic transmission shifter is gone, its 2000$ to replace because it requires half a wiring harness. Cause fuck logic right Toyota? My Jeeps would require sensors but they were always cheap.  I've also had to replace calipers(600 per caliper) along with some various sensors, and the AC Compressor because apparently it runs even with the heat on... Again fuck logic right.  Also Toyota has had some serious rust problems on the frames of Tacomas and Tundras so I needed to go to the dealer and have them inspect, they refused to replace the frame even though my 1997 Ranger has a MUCH nicer frame than the 2006 Tacoma. Its so rusty I'm concerned it'll actually break offroad.  I'm likely going to trade this thing in for a small car for my wife in another year or two and build up the ranger for overlanding between now and then. Its far more reliable than the tacoma has been."
overlanding,30od6l,Doctorphate,2,Sun Mar 29 14:26:25 2015 UTC,"Tundra is kinda large...  not that it can't make for an overlanding rig but the Taco is more aligned with the profile of off-road driving.  Sort of depends on your intent for overlanding.  if it will mostly be forest and logging roads a Tundra will be great...  if it will include 4x4 trails and two tracks to explore more remote locations you may struggle a bit depending on the terrain, trail width and obstacles."

overlanding,30io29,Kiriesh,6,Fri Mar 27 18:25:39 2015 UTC,"Wow...  That's just...  an amazing amount of disinformation.  Maybe I can relate how things work out here. The BLM designates areas as wilderness preserves - meaning no motorized vehicles in the preserve.  But, they mark trails through them where motorized vehicles are allowed.  I've been through a number of them and seen wildlife that rightly deserved to be protected because that was the one place in the world where that species lives.    There's a weird sparrow that lives only in one of the valleys behind my house - I've never seen another bird fly like that before.  The road through that valley is an official BLM trail, but it is not maintained.  It makes for a fun challenging Jeep trail.    Maybe there's a way to coexist?"

Both are documentaries/mini series following British actors Charley Boorman and Ewan McGregor as they drive around the world and from the top of the UK to the bottom of South Africa, respectively, on dual sport motorcycles. Shot in 2004 and 2007, both are worth binging on and have roughly 10hrs of episodes each. Not exactly hardcore wheeling and overlanding, but definitely some good exploration and good vibes that will get you in the mood to get out there.  Cool thread idea - I’m always looking for documentaries/series to watch on exploration. I’ve watched Expedition Overland all the way through and some Mountain State Overland."
overlanding,30i55w,jjallllday,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:14:46 2015 UTC,I saw both of these... and liked them.  What did you like about them?  As someone trying to make better off-road adventure videos I'm very curious since lots of people like the Long Ways but their was surprising little overlanding in these overlanding videos :-)
overlanding,30i55w,lgrt,2,Sat Mar 28 00:14:36 2015 UTC,"Hmm let me respond tomorrow at some point, on mobile now and formatting gets wonky for me"
overlanding,30i55w,jjallllday,2,Sat Mar 28 04:13:54 2015 UTC,"If you don't mind me chiming in, don't be afraid to talk to the camera. Think bloggers on YouTube and how popular they are. A simple dialog with the viewer can create a better connection and make them more invested in your success. Plus it helps put a face on the video and make it stand out."
overlanding,30i55w,Kiriesh,1 point,Mon Mar 30 19:17:38 2015 UTC,"Ok, so I'll deliver!  I think they were great overall and focused on their journey in an interesting way. It had enough of the offroad shots and their struggles with riding, but had some good balance with showing interviews with locals and all of that. It was geared more at the masses than the offroad/adventure community, but definitely appealed to all of us.  One thing Expedition Overland does that drives me up a wall is TOO MUCH DRAMATIZATION. They face small challenges and they blow it up. Sure, discuss what’s going on and be a bit nervous, but man they make a huge deal of it. Their cinematography is outstanding, though. They have the correct gear (between gimbals and drones and good cameras) and that makes a massive difference."
overlanding,30i55w,jjallllday,2,Sat Mar 28 22:15:01 2015 UTC,thx.  and I hear you on the over dramatization.  Always hate it when producers try to hype up a mole hill into a mountain.  thx again for the input
