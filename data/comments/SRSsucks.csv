Can't find the website for the agency contacting you?  Pretty fucking obvious red flag.  Most people assume scam the moment a company fails to show up in a single google search.  Even still, this is forgivable on it's own.  Some smaller companies haven't had the chance to go online yet.  Combined with her other mistakes though...  They're offering to fly you and a friend across the country without having worked together?  This is a huge red flag.  There are photographer's studios and makeup artists all over the country.  It seems like any legitimate agency would either tell you to get your own ass out to their studio for an audition, or if you're an obviously unique talent they could spend far less to vet you by sending you to a local studio/artist for test shots to at least verify you're worth the expense of a VIP treatment.  If it sounds too good to be true: it ain't.  He was super cool on the phone and facetime.  Really?  The dude was trying to sell you on a job that would benefit you?  Only pyramid schemes try this hard.  Obvious scam is obvious.  Even if she was telling the truth she made some of the dumbest decisions I've heard of in order to end up in that position.  I'm not a small or weak guy, but even I would think twice about flying out alone to meet complete strangers for a job with an agency I can't verify the existence of.    I think she's lying.  If not about the whole thing at least about much of it.  It's more likely she didn't fully appreciate what she was getting herself into when she signed up, as it seems is somewhat common among new female porn talent (male porn talent is typically pretty hard on the girls, and some aren't prepared), and regretted the decision when some guy started ramming his dick down her throat unapologetically while unromantically demanding she maintain poses and perform a certain way that isn't anything like the normal pleasurable sex she's used to.  Most pornstars say many of the positions you see in porn aren't nearly as pleasant as they look.  It's not sex for pleasure, it's sex for the camera.    Combine that with the fact that people she knows will one day find out about her video and she has every reason to backpedal and pretend it's everyone's fault but her own she got paid a fat stack to get fucked in front of a camera.  I've done thing I regret too, and I've caught myself making excuses like anyone else.  In the end, she chose to do what she did and it's nobody's fault but her own."

That means the court system knows that 98% of the cases they oversee, the woman was raped, and yet they're letting 97% of those rapists go knowing that they committed a crime? There's something not right just looking at that.  Furthermore, isn't it interesting how SRS and feminists keep bringing up the one instance with the Magic player not raping anyone and having support, but ignores the hundreds of men who are currently being exonerated for false rapes. Sure, there are very few false rapes haven't ruined any man's life right? /s  On a side note, this can't count as data or fact but I'm sure it would if it defended their side, but I have a buddy who works in the Phoenix Police Department. He told me once about how staggering the numbers of false rape reports they get is. I told him I probably could and he said it was more than half. The problem is is that they question the ""victims"" find out they're lying and don't even bother. I just went on RAIIN's site, according to them 9 out of every 100 rapists get prosecuted, 5 will get convicted of a FELONY, yet only 3 go to jail. Wait, so what happens to the 2 that were convicted of a felony? Does this make any sense to anyone?  I'm sure the 2-10% number might come from cases that go to court, and that's why they're on record whereas they just ignore reports that don't go to court. Hell, I'm not sure, but it seems like that's the case. I also read somewhere that the numbers only get counted if there's an arrest."

Well, they say that either only 40% of rapes are reported or 40% of rapes are never reported. Believe me, I get it that some rapes don't get reported (it's estimated that 80-90% of male rape victims by women never get reported either) but that's all speculation. So that number could actually be lower or even higher but we can't tell. Of course they say that it could be higher, emphasizing that they believe it is without any definitive proof.  They're saying 97% of rapists never get punished and 3% are. But that also includes supposedly 5% that are found guilty but 2% of those that are found guilty but don't receive punishment. Furthermore, as I said, doesn't it imply that the courts KNOW the girl was raped and still don't do anything if it's a ""proven fact"" that only 2% of rape claims are false? In order for it to get recorded there has to be an arrest. Just look at the UVA scandal. Yeah, false rape allegation that only got included because it became a national story.

Trust me, you're really not short. Furthermore, women really don't care about dick size as much as you probably think. Really, it isn't that big a factor, and if you've got to a point where she's seeing your dick, your most likely good to go either way. Exercise in any form helps physical and mental well being. Obviously I'm not suggesting this as some miracle cure for your problems, but it can really increase confidence and your own body image, as well as feeling less tired and just all round more healthy. It did well by me, and I'm a lot more confident than when I wasn't getting enough exercise. I personally would suggest swimming; it's fun and works plenty of muscle groups, whilst being good cardio. It also has low risk of injury if you worry about that at all. With the issue of depression, have you spoken to a medical professional about your feelings? There are different treatments which could help to improve your state of mind, and they're definitely worth a shot if you haven't already tried them. Finally, worrying about the size of your hands and feet is just not worth it. Trust me on this one, most people don't really care. I have the ugliest feet and hands, but it's really not something to worry about, it definitely hasn't held me back, and having small hands and feet shouldn't hold you back.  I really hope you feel better, and get in a better state if mind. I don't know much about you, but from what you've written so far, you seem like a nice guy who means well.

I've been in a similar boat to you before; I know the pessimism and cynicism which long-standing depression can bring with it, and so I understand that their reaction might seem normal and appropriate to you, but I can assure you that it's not; their lack of empathy and care was atrocious. At the VERY least - the dead minimum of compassion - they could have simply said nothing at all and left you to your own devices, but the best you got out of them was their going out of their way to say ""Not my problem. Go deal with it yourself, weirdo."" That's some cold-hearted bullshit there on their parts. They present themselves as being sophisticated, empathetic and just-minded people, but time and again we see instances like this where there's just no common human decency at play if you aren't ""one of them."" The fact that you presented yourself as an outsider was all it took for them to treat you like scum, and THAT'S what makes them ""suck.""   I'm not going to say that going to the gym is some sort of panacea which will solve all of your problems by any stretch, but in terms of your body issues, it might help in this specific sense: You'll be in a position to say ""Yeah, I've got these three things about my body that bug me, but I've got nine things that I take pride in, that I've earned, and that's pretty good."" That sort of thing breeds confidence, and it'll make it easier for you to deal with other people, both male and female, because you won't have this crushing weight of insecurity bearing you down and making you second-guess yourself anymore.   I know what it's like to be really, really depressed and gripped with self-loathing for a long period of time. You become so down on yourself that nobody wants to be around you because your depression depresses them. This in turn validates your self-loathing because it seems like you've been proven right in your low self-estimation. It can be a vicious circle. What I'm saying is, you need to find some self-confidence from within yourself which will help to break that circle. The knowledge that you're excellent in some regard, and in a way that others can appreciate and admire, will do wonders for you. And I mean, hell, what have you got to lose?"

Maybe you're right and there's no possible future in which feeling better about yourself will make you more appealing to other people, and all that comes from that. You could be right. I'm not denying that possibility.   I'm just saying, coming from a background where for years I couldn't deal with women at all due to crushing anxeity, where I hated everything about myself, where I self-mutilated out of abject loathing for myself and my body, where I spent as much time alone as possible in order to isolate myself from the possibility of embarrassment, mockery or rejection... to have gone from that to a point now where I'm at peace with myself, I have a good group of loyal friends, and am engaged to be married later this year to a beautiful and loving woman... I feel like it's not impossible either that there might be some parallels between our experiences and thus some possibility that the things which helped me get out of those years of gloom might be of some value to you.   If you're not interested in what I have to say, that's fine and I won't force the issue. I'm just saying that I see something of a kindred spirit in you and I would like to be able to help you walk the path to a happier future that I eventually did, and maybe a little bit more easily than I did.

I've been there, man. I could have typed virtually every single word in your posts up to this point myself, some twenty years ago, and with equal conviction.   And I eventually got out of it, and am leading a happy life with people who love and value me.   It's not impossible that you could, too.   If you sincerely don't want advice, then fair enough; I won't shove it down your throat. Instead, just allow me to offer you some tiny morsel of hope: The way that you see things - yourself included - isn't the only possible way to look at them.

Maybe it's all too cliched, or obvious, or useless, and I think you are probably smart enough to realize this already, but women don't exist for you. If the you are frightened when meeting women because you are attracted to them and you worry they will mock you, stop thinking about them as sexual objects.    Oh man this is rich. ""You're short and ugly please turn your sexuality off and stop desiring sexual interactions with women. Women don't exist to please you.""  lmfao.    that would probably help avoid this looking like some weird manipulation tactic aimed at the women on srsquestions.   Good lord.

A criticism of a side will likely be met with rebuttal, and although it might be an irrational response, I don't think it's destructive to the conversation.   What I'm talking about is identifying with a group that you side with on all issues (political parties, sjw's, etc). If one happens to align on all issues, it's unlikely, but fine. But the person I'm quoting clearly believes that an argument is only as good as the people making it, and that's what I have a problem with.

SRSsucks,3dqtaq,Managarmr420,11,Sat Jul 18 15:47:09 2015 UTC,"My theory hypothesis is that phrases like “freeze peach"" are a sort of proto-newspeak.  Essentially, it's an attempt to divorce a phrase from its most common meaning so that it can be redefined to suit the needs of the SJWs. This stems from their highly binary way of thinking - words or phrases having multiple meanings is something they don't like.  So when you say “free speech includes hate speech"" the SJW is forced to do one of two things. They can admit that their definition of free speech isn't the only one, or they can decide that you said something else. However, because they clearly heard the sound of your phrase, they need their alternative to be something that sounds identical or very similar. Hence the homophones.  What this leads to is odd-looking phrases being used all over communities infested with social justice as a coping mechanism to help them deal with concepts they find difficult (but that normal, well-adjusted people don't).  I will grant that it was used in a mocking fashion originally (lest any idiots try to use that defence) but it appears to have evolved from that.  If the hypothesis is correct, we should see increasing use of such phrases - up to the point of full-blown newspeak in some cases."
SRSsucks,3dqtaq,IVIaskerade,6,Sat Jul 18 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"Essentially, it's an attempt to divorce a phrase from its most common meaning so that it can be redefined to suit the needs of the SJWs. This stems from their highly binary way of thinking - words or phrases having multiple meanings is something they don't like.   I noticed this as well. They don't usually use a separate mocking phrase though.  Usually what they'll do is, if it's a ""bad"" word, they'll use political correctness to have it removed from the language. For example, in any context, the word ""cunt"" is bad and can't be used. You will be called a sexist if you use it. Once a word is forced to mean only its worst meaning in all contexts, there's no reason to use it, you are just painting a  bullseye on your face. The word is is retired; obsolete.   They can't do this with free speech though, because there's no ""racist"" or ""sexist"" or other convenient equivalent slanderous avenue that can be exploited to condemn people who try to defend it. So they invented a new term to dismiss free speech with. It's quite brilliant, really. But it's also terrifying.  They use these underhanded tactics to destroy and dismiss their opponents, regardless of what actual points are being made, and there's nothing ""reality"" can do about it, because public perception takes precedence, and political correctness must be adhered to in order to have a clean public perception.  So, to go along with your hypothesis, what we will see is more of these mocking phrases showing up for ideas that are difficult to criminalise/dismiss — are difficult to sway public perception against — unlike ""bad"" (sexist, racist, ableist, etc.) ideas/words.
