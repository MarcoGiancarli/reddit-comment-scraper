The orbits here look like footballs instead of off-center ellipses."
InternetIsBeautiful,3dye44,browsah,6,Mon Jul 20 20:20:27 2015 UTC,"A 1/r gravitational force is a reasonable guess for gravity in a 2-dimensional environment, since one way to derive the 1/r2 factor in our 3 dimensions is through the surface area of a sphere. The analogue in 2d is the perimiter of a circle, hence the 1/r. This sort of derivation is usually done in the context of electromagnetism, considering charges within and magnetic flux through a spherical surface, but it works fine for gravity too.  1/r forces are very unfamiliar, though. In particular, as a consequence of Bertrand's Theorem, bound orbits in a 1/r force don't need to be closed, so you can watch a particle orbit around one of the attractors without ever ending up in the same place with the same speed twice."

InternetIsBeautiful,3dye44,FullStackDeveloper,101,Mon Jul 20 16:32:40 2015 UTC,This is what I made for fun. Not as extensive as the one above but still something... also open source on github. Also no flash

InternetIsBeautiful,3dye44,FullStackDeveloper,6,Mon Jul 20 18:54:29 2015 UTC,"F5? You can also fork the code from the gravity module off github, it's a pretty simple JS module that just handles body movement and gravitational forces"
InternetIsBeautiful,3dye44,merv243,3,Mon Jul 20 19:03:05 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I should've just said clear.  Anyways, I've already saved this to visit the code later, but was just playing around.  It's real cool, no doubt."

InternetIsBeautiful,3dye44,FullStackDeveloper,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:19:13 2015 UTC,You can switch between bodies/masses on the fly in the API for the rendering module so it's pretty easy to implement. Will add when I get a chance
InternetIsBeautiful,3dye44,rhm2084,2,Mon Jul 20 22:17:26 2015 UTC,Pretty cool!  You can turn it into a puzzle game where the goal is to shoot an object and make it orbit around a certain planet or a comet (like the Rosetta mission) with the help of gravity forces from different objects.
InternetIsBeautiful,3dye44,AnotherTemp,8,Mon Jul 20 23:28:05 2015 UTC,"This is a massive improvement, but I've noticed some inaccuracy with large masses. If I create a single mass of 109, then create another mass of 103 an inch or two away, the small mass occasionally flies through the large mass and keeps going off-screen, never to return.  I would guess that, once per constant timestep, you simply compute the acceleration due to gravity on each mass, then update its velocity with a*dt, then move it v*dt? If so, switching from Euler's method to RK4 could help. Last time I wrote a physics simulation, it helped me a lot."

InternetIsBeautiful,3e2ryu,Late_To_Parties,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:31 2015 UTC,This looks really cool but I don't understand it. Can someone give me an explanation of what I'm seeing?
InternetIsBeautiful,3e2ryu,throwaway_the_fourth,3,Tue Jul 21 15:35:40 2015 UTC,"The blockchain moves from most current on the left, all the way back to the genesis block from 2009 on the right (there are a lot in between in the ellipsis). the gems coming down are new transactions yet to be processed, and it looks like the type of gem depends on quantity of bitcoins transferred. Some also have a die graphic and I assume those are from/to known bitcoin gambling site addresses. You can click on gems to see specifics of the transaction, and on blocks to see what transactions were processed. Bitcoin aims to mine a new block of processed transactions every 10 minutes, but it's not exact. Every 2016 blocks (should be 2 weeks at 10min a block), the system averages the processing time for blocks and changes the difficulty of mining problems up or down based on how much computing power is on the network. You can see the amount of unconfirmed transactions at the bottom under ""Memory Pool"". It may look like a lot, but there are generally a ton of spam transactions for tiny fractions of bitcoins that miners generally leave out."
InternetIsBeautiful,3e2ryu,epsilion11,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:01:00 2015 UTC,where does it get these problems that computers solve? and why are they valuable?
InternetIsBeautiful,3e2ryu,BeijingBitcoins,2,Tue Jul 21 18:57:34 2015 UTC,"http://files.brendafernandez.com/Mastering%20Bitcoin/Mastering%20Bitcoin.pdf  Read section 2 for a brief overview, sections 7 & 8 for in-depth explanations.  From Section 2   A good way to describe mining is like a giant competitive game of sudoku that resets every time someone finds a solution and whose difficulty automatically adjusts so that it takes approximately 10 minutes to find a solution. Imagine a giant sudoku puzzle, several thousand rows and columns in size. If I show you a completed puzzle you can verify it quite quickly. However, if the puzzle has a few squares filled and the rest is empty, it takes a lot of work to solve! The difficulty of the sudoku can be adjusted by changing its size (more or fewer rows and columns), but it can still be verified quite easily even if it is very large. The “puzzle” used in bitcoin is based on a cryptographic hash and exhibits similar characteristics: it is asymmetrically hard to solve but easy to verify, and its difficulty can be adjusted.     From Section 8   At the time block 277,316 was mined, the version number describing the block structure is version “2”, which is encoded in little-endian format in 4 bytes as 0x02000000.      Next, the mining node needs to add the “Previous Block Hash”. That is the hash of the block header of block 277,315, the previous block received from the network, which Jing’s node has accepted and selected as the parent of the candidate block 277,316. The block header hash for block 277,315 is 0000000000000002a7bbd25a417c0374cc55261021e8a9ca74442b01284f0569.  The next step is to summarize all the transactions with a Merkle Tree, in order to add the Merkle Root to the block header. The generation transaction is listed as the first transaction in the block. Then, 418 more transactions are added after it, for a total of 419 transactions in the block. As we saw in the “Merkle Trees” on page 170, there must be an even number of “leaf ” nodes in the tree, so the last transaction is duplicated, creating 420 nodes, each containing the hash of one transaction. The transaction hashes are then combined, in pairs, creating each level of the tree, until all the transactions are summarized into one node at the “root” of the tree. The root of the merkle tree sum‐ marizes all the transactions into a single 32 byte value c91c008c26e50763e9f548bb8b2fc323735f73577effbc55502c51eb4cc7cf2e which you can see listed as “merkle root” in Example 8-3  The mining node will then add a 4-byte timestamp, encoded as a Unix “Epoch” time‐ stamp, which is based on the number of seconds elapsed from January 1st, 1970, mid‐ night UTC/GMT. The time 1388185914 is equal to Friday, 27 Dec 2013, 23:11:54 UTC/ GMT.  The node then fills in the difficulty target, which defines the required Proof-of-Work difficulty to make this a valid block. The difficulty is stored in the block as a “difficulty bits” metric, which is a mantissa-exponent encoding of the target. The encoding has a one-byte exponent, followed by a 3 byte mantissa (coefficient). In block 277,316, for example, the difficulty bits value is 0x1903a30c. The first part 0x19 is a hexadecimal exponent, while the next part 0x03a30c is the coefficient. The concept of a difficulty target is explained in “Difficulty Target and Re-Targeting” on page 199 and the “difficulty bits” representation is explained in “Difficulty Representation” on page 198.  The final field is the nonce, which is initialized to zero.  With all the other fields filled, the block header is now complete and the process of mining can begin. The goal is now to find a value for the nonce that results in a block header hash that is less than the difficulty target. The mining node will need to test billions or trillions of nonce values before a nonce is found that satisfies the requirement."

InternetIsBeautiful,3dymoe,TippyTopDog,3,Tue Jul 21 00:57:13 2015 UTC,"likely using one time pads which are indeed uncrackable simply because any message is equally likely to be valid. for instance a message  8888 888888 could say ""kill hitler"" or ""heil hitler"" because each letter is independently coded, either could be valid.  the problem with one time pads, and why we don't use them anymore are as follows   the encryption keys are the same length of a message, so a 12KB message would need in addition a 12KB key, not so terrible unless you're encrypting a 12 GB file and are forced to double into 24GB's it requires secure transport. traditionally this would be the briefcase with a pair of handcuffs attached would come in. this is both costly and resource intensive. the alternative is asymmetrical encryption however, when you rely on such methodology you are lowering the level of difficulty of cracking severely. one time pads rely on true random number generators, which are time consuming to create as it requires either a physical process (such as tossing a die). or an entropy pool which can deplete fairly easily. lastly and most critically the entire site is unencrypted so everything (including your password is sent over the open) where it can be snooped upon by anyone who is interested.   it's an interesting concept and is well worth looking at if you've ever wondered how it all works. however this technology is severely flawed and you should not transmit anything sensitive over it.  tl;dr: it's theoretically uncrackable, however it's weaknesses make said statement impossible to achieve."

InternetIsBeautiful,3dymoe,DogWatcherDog,0,Mon Jul 20 23:30:34 2015 UTC,Being uncrackable means you can't decode it without the password.  With the password it's quite easy.  The site even has a page about how to decode: http://www.octagon8.net/decode_howto.html
InternetIsBeautiful,3dymoe,Samuel-,0,Tue Jul 21 02:17:58 2015 UTC,"So then what's the point? If you can't decode it without the password, then why should you have to decode it? Can't you just password protect a message that's in english and this would have the same effect?"

Americans may argue over who pays what or how much, but pretty universally it's agreed that the absolute most vulnerable should be given a hand.  No one on any economic scale from any political party disagrees with that.  The difference tends to be in the degrees.   Are you a 70 year old with poor health?  Then you should be helped because X.  Are you 28 in good health but no job/income?  That's where you see some divide in the wealth\political structure."

InternetIsBeautiful,3dqs2e,Derp-Boy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:47:42 2015 UTC,"So the website is just going to rely on the generosity of the oh so benevolent and generous user? And what about people that check out the site once and never come back? The kind of people who throw a fit, leave, and complain about not being able to use an AdBlocker are probably not users that are going to be missed as they probably wouldn't even turn it off later on if they can't stand advertisements that much. Just hope that those people REALLY like your website, because they're not likely to turn off their adblockers unless they think it's quite exceptional! I mean, a thousand users with adblockers leave because they can't use an adblocker, no revenue. A thousand users check out the site once or twice with an adblocker on and never come back, also no revenue. I'd say the ones who are pretty fucking stupid are the ones who are bitching about this in the first place."

InternetIsBeautiful,3do9hx,_starrydynamo_,4,Sat Jul 18 00:26:13 2015 UTC,It's more to do with volume of visits rather than visits over time. This might get a steady 100+ views/day and then suddenly experiences a reddits worth.

InternetIsBeautiful,3do9hx,tent405,8,Sat Jul 18 16:14:24 2015 UTC,"This just gave me the coolest idea.  A dynamic, minimalist desktop wallpaper, composed of two colours, separated vertically, that updates, adding vertical columns of pixels to reflect the time of day.  There are 86400 seconds in a day, so with a resolution of 1080x1920, this would be every 45 seconds if adding one column of pixels at a time, or every 1:30 if adding 2 columns at a time, etc.  It would essentially be a left-to right loading bar for the day, expressed on the desktop. I often switch to new blank workspaces, as I use Linux and a tiling window manager, so I would see it very often.  One could even add markers to denote the hours, dynamic art,  etc.  I'm not sure how I'm going to accomplish this. Time for a script adventure!"

Tried a few more times, all 900+, and I'm consistently behind the beat from years of playing laid-back r&b/soul.  For those having difficulty, try playing eighth notes. In other words, tap at double the tempo, alternating between the space bar on the beat, and a ""ghost note"" press on a modifier key like Command or Alt on between each beat. You might keep better time if you sub-divide each beat this way."

InternetIsBeautiful,3djvrn,FlipTheFalcon,45,Fri Jul 17 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"The real fallacy is that the tempo is supposed to remain completely machine-like and constant throughout the entire performance of a musical piece.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The tempo is supposed to fluctuate depending on the feel of a particular section, the progression and mood of the piece, the energy that the band is putting into it, etc.  When I was getting my masters I took a class in Music Signal Processing and we looked at some analysis of tempo in classical music, in particular a pianist playing a piece by Chopin.  The tempo was basically all over the place, exactly as it should be.  If that pianist had played to a fixed and unchanging rhythm, the piece would have sounded lifeless and wooden.  I'm a drummer and one of my pet peeves is when somebody asks if I can play along with a click track.  Uh, yeah, sure I can play along with a click track -- if you want the drums to sound like they're being played by a zombie.  But if you're going to ask me to do that, then just fuckin' forget it and sequence the drums and I'll go get a beer -- at that point what the hell do you need me for?"

This demo could tell you a lot more about your motor timekeeping abilities.  The linked-to demo uses a two phase synchronization-continuation task. One can examine the statistical properties that capture the timing variability from one response to the next, response asynchrony in the synchronization phase, the total variability over an entire series of responses, the mean drift over a series of responses, and both of those with respect to the mean target interval to reveal a lot more about timekeeping ability.  More specifically, one's rhythm keeping ability can be decomposed into separate sensorimotor control processes that are independently variable. These processes are suggested to relate to encoding the intended response interval, and to one's proficiency in implementing that internally encoded timing goal into a motor response. Of course, short-term memory is also implicated in accordance with other parameters of the task as well, such as the target interval duration and the total number of responses collected.  Other behavioural trends emerge as well, such as Weber scaling wherein the variability increases as a function of increasing the duration of the target interval.  Here's a link to a review paper by one of the pioneering researchers in this field who promotes this above mentioned information processing model  http://e.guigon.free.fr/rsc/article/Wing02.pdf   Lots more extensions of this work exist, with some theories that attempt to explain sensorimotor timekeeping behaviour from a dynamical systems perspective http://e.guigon.free.fr/rsc/article/Schoner02.pdf  Another good paper relating to the neural mechanisms underlying timekeeping ability in different contexts http://psychology.uiowa.edu/files/psychology/groups/hazelab/files/HazeltineHelmothIvry97.pdf  edit: details"

InternetIsBeautiful,3dm8o6,lo_and_be,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:36:32 2015 UTC,"This data isn't terribly valuable at determining which surgeons are better.   Maybe, maybe not. The automatic dismissal of the possibility that it's valuable because :   Surgical complications are primarily related to the patients. An obese older smoker who clearly hasn't followed pre-surgical instructions is far more likely to suffer complications than a young, healthy patient. At top hospitals, the best surgeons take the most complex cases. They watch their outcomes, but they target a moderate ratio to ensure that train wrecks receive care, and they just balance them out with easier patients.   simply isn't realistic.  Your statements are accurate as far as they go, but they don't, in and of themselves, negate the potential value of this information.    Healthcare outcomes are a tricky thing to predict or analyze for many reasons, including those you mention...but this doesn't mean it can't be (and isn't) done.  You're right...an overweight 55 yr old man who's smoked for 40 years can expect a different outcome from laproscopic gall bladder removal than a 30 year old female in excellent shape.  You don't need (though one could easily enough dig it up) a detailed set of patient histories to know the validity of that statement.  What you're not accounting for, however, is that there are enough of each population that we can know the expected outcomes for each.  Nothing says we have to compare them as equal populations.  I can  quite easily determine that the expected outcome for the overweight man is perhaps a 3 day hospital stay, a 6 week recovery, and a 1.2% chance of post-operative complications, while for the young woman those numbers are 1 day, 4 weeks, and 0.3%.  So...give me 2 surgeons who do this procedure 100 times.  I can make a judgement based on how often...and by how much...their outcome differed from the expected outcomes for the patient population in question.  In other words...if most male obese smokers spend 3 days in the hospital, and in 37 of 45 cases where a surgeon treated a male obese smoker his patient spent 5 days in the hospital, something's going on...and it's not just because some other surgeon ""cherry picked the easy ones"".  Now I'll be honest...I haven't read this site's explanations of their methodology nor dug into their populations...though they are transparent enough to have at least made that information available in seveeral instances.  So, whether or not they adjusted for such things, and if so how, is available...and would speak volumes to whether or not ""this data is terribly valuable"".  So hey...you may well be right.  This site may be complete bunk...or at least need to be taken with a large grain of salt.  IMO, the majority of such sites do indeed fall in that category.  But since their methodologies are available, make that determination based on a thorough review and understanding of them...(and again, I'll readily acknowledge I've not done so because, quite frankly, I'm not that bored at the moment lol ) not simply because some patients do worse than others, and surgeons like easy patients.  :)    Source : 20+ yrs doing data analytics and data mining, the last 15 of it with a healthcare company where, among other things, I design, build, and maintain systems that analyze surgical outcomes. :)  (For what it's worth, a quick glance at a couple of procedures across a small (P<10) set of hospitals suggests that their assessments of outcomes more or less match various others found in the industry.  In short, for a quick check of a small sample size, their results are, shall we say, ""believable"".)"
InternetIsBeautiful,3dm8o6,EorEquis,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:43:14 2015 UTC,"So you are correct, they could correct for this based on complexity, but I will tell you that coding is an art and not a science,    Heh...I'll buy that.  It is, at the very least, a mixture of both at times...with a bit of black magic thrown in for good measure. :)  And there's no doubt that ANY methodology is going to both contradict the personal experiences of some patients (A family member of mine is a first hand example of a situation similar to your own) AND fail to account for every possible situation.  Quite honestly, patients simply sometimes surprise us...both positively and negatively.  It happens, and no amount of ""predictive analytics"" will ever account for them...and sometimes there's doctors who wind up with these patients for all manner of reasons that the ""expected outcomes"" simply don't account for.   I did not check methodology, but remain skeptical, and I believe justifiably.   And you SHOULD!  I think that's probably the whole point of this discussion...you ABSOLUTELY should be skeptical of ANYONE'S claim that a particular practitioner or facility is better or worse at certain procedures than another.  There are hundreds and hundreds of individuals, companies, and entities that have a vested interest in certain outcomes or trends...they don't all agree, they aren't all ethical, and their relationships to those presenting the information aren't always apparent.  By all means, be skeptical...but be skeptical armed with an understanding of how these numbers can be generated.  :)"

InternetIsBeautiful,3dm8o6,Tittypants,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:46:15 2015 UTC,"From a medical perspective, I think the complication rate can easily be misinterpreted. Many doctors, who care about their patients, admit patients as a precaution instead of an actual complication. Admissions are counted as complications. If someone is having some lightheadedness after surgery, 9 times out of 10 it is nothing serious. The one time a doctor doesn't admit the patient, it's a pulmonary embolism and the patient has the possibility of dieing."

Getting rid of the jingling removed the changing height so that was certainly the problem. I imagine what was happening was as the word jingled around the borders tried to remain a constant offset from the edges of the word. So when the word moved right it would add a couple pixels, the same with as it went down. On my screen at least the constantly changing size was enough to go between needing a scrollbar and not so it would constantly pop in and out causing the entire site to shudder.

InternetIsBeautiful,3da3u7,bceagle411,49,Wed Jul 15 00:37:28 2015 UTC,"It comes down to the angular resolution of Hubble, Those distant galaxies that Hubble can see are huge and far away. Pluto is small and close, but it turns out that the galaxies look 1300 times larger from Earth.   I made a simple illustration. To Hubble, a galaxy may look bigger even though it is far. Pluto will look smaller because it is much much smaller than a galaxy.   http://i.imgur.com/vlzKnRm.png  For this reason, Hubble did not have the resolution to map all of Pluto's surface.  Here is a good read on this. Feel free to ask follow up questions.  http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2013/02141014-hubble-galaxy-pluto.html?referrer=https://www.google.com/"

InternetIsBeautiful,3da3u7,Bobby6kennedy,3,Thu Jul 16 04:04:54 2015 UTC,"Jupiter is HUGE!!!  Even the enthusiast on Earth can see the detail of Jupiter if their telescope is large enough.  Here  is an image stolen from /r/astrophotography on this thread.  These objects were captured separately from a dude on Earth and added into the one image. So, we can see the detail of Jupiter even through Earth's thick atmosphere. The Hubble telescope is much larger (absorbs more light) and doesn't have to fight with the atmosphere so it will take even better images than we can on Earth's surface.  As a contrast, Here is an image of Pluto from this thread. It is so much smaller than Jupiter that we cannot see any of its features.  Pluto is much much smaller than Jupiter as you can visualize here.   Summary: 2 main reasons  1) Jupiter is HUGE, much bigger than pluto  2) Jupiter is much closer than Pluto  Feel free to ask any follow up questions!   Check out some other stuff on /r/astrophotography to get a better sense of good images from ground based telescopes."

InternetIsBeautiful,3da3u7,jt663,14,Wed Jul 15 10:38:59 2015 UTC,"Like u/8BitTRex explained, the angular resolution is key here.  Think about the Andromeda Galaxy. The Hubble image is gorgeous, isn't it?  Andromeda is very far away. 2,5 millions light years away from our galaxy. But it is so huge that even at this great distance, its angular size is bigger than the moon.  It is possible to see Andromeda with the naked eye, but very difficult to do it in urban places (light pollution sucks!). If the galaxy was brighter, this is what you would see in comparison to the moon.  The celestial bodies are measured in angles. Just to give you a notion of size, the moon is 31' wide. Pluto, on the other hand, is only 0.115'' wide.   With these numbers, you can say that Pluto, from our perspective, looks 16173 times smaller than the Moon! No wonder that even Hubble couldn't resolve its surface better than it did.  Somebody please check this, because I'm surprised with the results and I'm not 100% certain about it :)"
InternetIsBeautiful,3da3u7,mvpetri,13,Wed Jul 15 10:46:43 2015 UTC,"Explanation. TLDR: Pluto is actually too small. Galaxies are farther away, but they're so much larger than Pluto that they still appear larger."
InternetIsBeautiful,3da3u7,hipbonejars,3,Wed Jul 15 06:13:42 2015 UTC,"Adding to other responses, Hubble gets great, crisp photos of objects that are very faint by long exposure times. Something like the HUDF had months of exposure time that summed to a great picture.  You can't quite do this with Pluto because for one it moves as it orbits the sun, but also it rotates. Any significantly long exposure will become a smear."

The URL can be manipulated (apache has mod_rewrite) so you can set a rule where every page is sent to index.php, regardless of the actual URL.    That is, every domain.com/xxxxxxxxxx address is actually requesting domain.com/index.php  The request is then passed to the server side application (your index.php). Your PHP code can read the original URL and extract the text inside that URL.  There are functions to replace characters, so you replace every dash with spaces, and set the first letter to uppercase.

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,organic-neural-net,22,Tue Jul 14 02:30:02 2015 UTC,"I don't think it would. It's not a matter of seeing red as green or something similarly stable (if it was, we'd just call red green). Instead it's more like colors are fluid to us. We can often concentrate and tell you what kind of color it is (depending on the surroundings), but often we will be wildly off and we can easily see the same color as something else entirely in the exact same context.  It's really quite hard to describe it. When I look at the fluid color chart you see in Word for example, I will actually see the demarcations between the color groups (reddish, bluish, etc.) in noticeably different locations between glances."

Even though I didn't notice this unstable view on color, later in life I noticed a few specific instances of it.  The biggest example was getting a bunch of red and green poker chips at a poker tournament in one stack in dimly lighted room.  When I got them, they looked all mixed up so I sorted them by red and green.  Then I looked again and they were still mixed up.  Eventually, it got to the point where I could hold up the stack of mixed chips, close my eyes, and then open them again and they would be in a completely different order.    Luckily the tables had more light so there wasn't this issue, but sometimes you'll just find the right environment or lighting conditions where your mind can't make up what your eyes are seeing and will change.  Think the blue/black white/gold dress picture for a real world example."

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,Deinos_Mousike,18,Tue Jul 14 01:04:08 2015 UTC,"This is a VERY simple AI. All it does is uses regression to find the nearest color from the data it saved, and it guesses that color.  Open up your console and type in:  JSON.stringify(colorOptions);   That will show what the computer thinks the characteristics of each color is.  For example on my test it thinks red is rgb(101, 34, 40) — which is pretty good.  On the flipside it thinks blue is rgb(78,83,206) — also pretty good. The more you train it the more it gets focussed in on a color in particular to represent the channel and then whenever there's a random color it searches through the possibilities to find the nearest match (in rgb scale). So like I said, it's really simple. Just a one-bit regression mechanism that provides some sort of ""intelligence"" function."

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,Celeodor,14,Tue Jul 14 01:42:35 2015 UTC,"If you click view-source, it's all right there in the JavaScript section.  Keep in mind though, as others said, this is not the most efficient way or accurate way of training a computer to get the correct color, but it is the easiest way.  Basically though for an explanation of the code:  Create an object in JS for each color's properties.   Generate random colors from rgb values (eg. rgb(134,52,54)).  When the color shows up in the body, have the user guess the color. If you guess it as red, you'll click the red div. When you click the red div it gets the body color and pushes it into the object for color properties.  Now the object looks like this:   properties = {     ""red"": [[134,52,54], 1] };   The first array element is the colors the computer now thinks red represents. The second element is the number of samples of red the computer has.  So now a green background comes up rgb(23,211,18), and you click the green div to assign the value to green.  Now the object looks like:  properties = {     ""red"": [[134,52,54], 1],     ""green"": [[23,211,18], 1] };   So now if the next value isrgb(120,50,62), the computer will look at both red and green in the object and see which the value is closer to. It's closer to red, so the computer will ""guess"" the color is red.  Make sense?"

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,Muteatrocity,24,Mon Jul 13 23:52:06 2015 UTC,Why does it put a spoiler over its guess?
InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,ArmaTiroPum,67,Mon Jul 13 23:12:59 2015 UTC,So that it doesn't sway you. Sometimes if a color is somewhere between two colors you may be tempted to sway in favor of the AI.
InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,gamelizard,31,Mon Jul 13 23:28:31 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. In that case, it should reveal its guess after your click and before the next click. That way you don't have to keep moving your cursor around the screen and can just keep it by the colors."

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,KuribohGirl,4,Tue Jul 14 02:27:48 2015 UTC,"Ah, so what you'd do is extract the data from the bot.  You can extract the metadata by going into the console and typing in:  JSON.stringify(colorOptions);  On my trial of 200 (with 65% accuracy), here are the values for colors:  ""{""red"":[[201.34782608695656,51.17391304347826,96.86956521739137],23],""orange"":[[184.11111111111111,133.55555555555557,41.27777777777777],18],""yellow"":[[201.46153846153845,211.23076923076923,92.92307692307692],13],""green"":[[73.57971014492753,191.34782608695656,89.88405797101446],69],""blue"":[[67.75675675675674,118.56756756756756,198.86486486486487],37],""violet"":[[169.4,74.89999999999999,187.175],40]}""  You could then use the following code:  function guessColor (channels, colorOptions, opKey) {     var resid;     residArr = [];      channelsRatio = [1, channels[1] / channels[0], channels[2] / channels[0]];      for (var x = 0; x < opKey.length; x++) {         resid = 0;          for (var y = 0; y < colorOptions[opKey[x]][0].length; y++) {             resid += Math.abs(channelsRatio[y] - (colorOptions[opKey[x]][0][y] / colorOptions[opKey[x]][0][0]));         }          residArr.push(resid);     }      return residArr.min(); }   So if you find a color you don't know, say rgb(123, 84, 164);  You can type into console:   guessColor([123, 84, 164], colorOptions, opKey);   And for my version it outputs:   // Object {min: 0.5287099617984135, minKey: 5}  The minKey corresponds to the correct color. So you plug it into opKey, which is the key for colorOptions as:   opKey[5];   And it gives the result:  // ""violet""  Which happens to be correct!"

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,LOLMUFFINLOL,2,Tue Jul 14 01:30:18 2015 UTC,And that's okay! Sometimes it'll guess a few correctly and it'll give a score of 100% correct since you just started. Naturally the score will go down because the AI was just lucky instead of informed correctly. Once you keep training it it'll flatline at a higher number. I'd gotten to around 75-80% and others have reported near 70%.  Just keep training it like you would a kid who is learning colors. :)

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,putrid_moron,2,Tue Jul 14 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yep! It's part of the method I'm building on now.   The more advanced algorithm uses maps to find what ""color zone"" a value set is, and it finds the nearest ""comps"" — using the k-nearest algorithm.  It is a better way of classifying, but it is less easy to show as example. This code as is, is an example of how to make the easiest possible AI.  You would be correct though in saying that k-nearest would be a better classifier for this dataset though."

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,ThatBannedGuy,2,Tue Jul 14 08:26:50 2015 UTC,"I would have preferred to see Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Red, Green, Blue as the 6 colours to choose from. They're equally spaced apart on the colour wheel and are the 3 primary colours of light + the three primary colours of ink (which makes them secondary colours of both systems as well, Cyan is the direct oposite to Red, while Green/Red are 1/3 of the way around from each other).  I rarely assigned colours to Orange becasue they're usually too close to either Yellow or Red for me to choose otherwise.  I also didn't know where to assign Brown, White, Grey and Black, usually the White-Black colours had a small shade of Green or Blue in them and I just labeled all the Browns as Orange.    Edit: I just saw that you changed it to be using HSB values instead of RGB and now I'm even more confused about your choice of 6 colours. Let's say Red is Hue 0, this means Yellow is Hue 60, Green 120, Cyan 180, Blue 240, Magenta 300. I don't understand why you picked Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue Violet. (0, 30, 60, 120, 240, 330). There is too much emphasis on the red colours with them having only 30 degrees between them, and there's a gap of 120 degrees between Green and Blue.  Maybe it's not supposed to be uniform which helps the AI distinguish colours in a different way, but that's not something I understand."

InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,razorbeamz,2,Tue Jul 14 04:02:22 2015 UTC,Yep that's kinda my plan. Apple Music has backgrounds and font colors that vary depending on the main and sub-colors of albums. I'd like to train an AI to find the three dominant colors in most images to automatically generate color palettes for text based on the background colors.
InternetIsBeautiful,3d637i,iwouldliketoreply,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:07:47 2015 UTC,"Cool! Hmm, I don't know if you would need an AI for that. The k-means thing I described will find the major colors in an image without a neural network. The reason AI would be used is for taking a color and putting a name like ""red"" on it. Which is hard because just in hex or RBG there are like 100,000 combinations of colors that could be considered red.   Now maybe you want to train a network to find color palettes that are pleasing to the user. That would be cool. I might just be misunderstanding your desired outcome! But anything with neural networks or some type of learning algorithm involved, Im in!  Wow, I skipped over the two important words ""Text based"" haha sorry.  Sounds like a cool project!"

Do you think its fair that we take out every other living thing on this planet with us on our way out? Additionally these animals, regardless of how rare you think they are, are likely vital to their ecosystem and most of the time they're ""rare"" or ""special"" because humans have otherwise decimated their population. These animals deserve to live just as much as any of us and taking steps to preserve them and reduce/reverse the impact people have had on them is an important initiative. It is the mentality of people like you that allow these species to die out and go extinct. You are right in saying no other animal would start a campaign to save us but I hope you realize our capacity for thought and reason goes beyond most animals. Or at least I thought it did. You seem to be very much caught up in a pessimistic mentality that is IMO also incredibly selfish. This world didn't start with humans and it shouldn't end with us either."
InternetIsBeautiful,3d87hb,Tupptupp_XD,0,Tue Jul 14 15:04:20 2015 UTC,"We are at the top of the food chain, which means we will kill off other species.

InternetIsBeautiful,3d87hb,Tupptupp_XD,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:43:14 2015 UTC,"I read your reply, but I don't agree with it. You say animals deserve to live just as much as us, and that is wrong. Animals can't do anything. They can't think like we can. We have intelligence and technology. We actually matter.   Earth without humans would not be interesting. It would be an area where animals and plants grow, and die, then repeat. Since we can do much more than that, we are more valuable.  If an animal species is vital to an ecosystem, then steps should be made to protect that animal, but if it isn't we shouldn't invest any money into protecting them.  This is why the WWF wants to protect pandas:   ""We should do everything we can to save the giant panda because we are the ones that have driven it to the edge of extinction. And because we can. But pandas also play a crucial role in China's bamboo forests by spreading seeds and helping the vegetation to grow.""  About their only valid point, about seeds and vegetation in the environment, I'd think many many animals also spread seeds around. Pandas aren't the only herbivores in the forests.  The other two reasons WWF has to save them is that we've killed them off, and that we can. Why should we have an obligation to replenish a population pandas when they are not necessary to the environment. And just because we can do something, doesn't mean that we should.  Taking this into account, for some reason, the WWF has their logo as a panda bear.   Just to note, I'm not saying I agree with Burst_thought_bubble, and I don't think we should just kill off all the animals, but we should actually think about which animals are worth saving, and which ones aren't."
InternetIsBeautiful,3d87hb,Burst_thought_bubble,-4,Fri Jul 17 08:36:54 2015 UTC,"I never asked, why don't we keep ruining these animals environments. I am just wondering why we seem to care about their preservation. They will, no matter how much we try, not live as a speices on this planet for much longer in the grand stretch of things. I just want to know why we care."
InternetIsBeautiful,3d87hb,jesusgecko99,2,Tue Jul 14 15:17:49 2015 UTC,"Consider this then. Every species that is currently alive today is a culmination of many millions of years of evolution. Then suddenly you halt the evolution of hundreds and thousands of species because they have been recklessly killed off. What happen 1000 years from now? What about 10,000? In a million years? You are left with either a) no organic life because the ecosystems have all collapsed, b) very little organic life with poor genetic diversity making them susceptible to disease or other forms of mass extinction or, c) life has regressed back to much simpler forms as most complex organisms have died out during the collapse of most ecosystems which the result of reckless treatment of their environment, most often due to human impact.  It may not seem important at a surface level, but maintaining organic diversity is essential for maintaining life as a whole on this planet. So yes, you are correct, most species that are alive today will not be in the grand stretch of things. But if we proceed with that mentality then very few things will survive in the grand stretch. So through preservation of these species we can ensure, baring significant natural disasters, that life is maintained on earth long after we are dead."
InternetIsBeautiful,3d87hb,Tupptupp_XD,0,Tue Jul 14 15:47:15 2015 UTC,"Well I think your comment is valid, but worded in a way that is asking for downvotes.   I don't really see why we need to save the tigers. Sure they are endangered, but that's natural, some animals will just die out. Humans are the top of the food chain, and as a result, we will kick the other animals down.  Tigers don't have much of an impact in the food chain, and ecosystems wouldn't fall apart if there were no tigers in the world. We only really care about them because they are large mammals that can be seen as lovable and valuable. In reality, they don't add much to the world, and if they went extinct, nothing bad would happen, and nothing would really change.  I think if there was an obscure rat species that was going extinct, nobody would care, because we don't think highly of rats since they aren't cute or large.   If we want to spend money on saving certain species, then the funds should be directed towards species that ecosystems depend on to thrive. Not cute, fluffy, or large things like pandas, elephants, rhinos, and tigers."

As time progressed they killed off most of the world's population, but not all of them. As the AI evolved and developed and developed better and better machines, eventually the balance came where the rebel factions of mankind left were of no threat any longer. So a movement in the skynet AI was started to instead study mankind. Machines were built to enslave all the humanity that is left, in towers of liquid pods, and as a final insult to humanity, use them as power sources. All of mankind eventually was connected together in a large virtual recreation of now. Except in this world, his name isn't John Connor, it's Neo."

It's already too big vertically to fit in the world, and your 'pixels' would probably end up being more than one meter square in order to accommodate 'hiding' spots for the pusher blocks, which would make your screen even bigger, but as long as you're okay with reprogramming minecraft to run at a tiny resolution when you're running it inside your minecraft computer inside minecraft inside your computer, sure it's possible."

InternetIsBeautiful,3d1f3z,CowboyNinjaAstronaut,7,Mon Jul 13 01:53:31 2015 UTC,"ELI5 version: Turing completeness is a way of saying ""you can do anything programmable in this language.""   Generally something is Turing complete if it has memory (the ability to store and reuse results) and control flow decision making ability (""if this condition is true, run this bunch of code. If not, run this other bunch of code."").  Almost every language you've ever heard of is Turing complete, because if it isn't, without even realizing what ""Turing completeness"" means, people will add whatever functionality is missing to solve their problem.  This means you can, theoretically, program anything in anything. We use different languages for different tasks because of features of the language that make it well suited for the task at hand. But at the end of the day, slow as balls and convoluted as fuck as it may be, I could program Doom into an Excel spreadsheet.  Once you realize the abstract similarities in all programming languages, it makes them much easier to pick up. It simply becomes a question of learning the programming paradigm and the syntax, and you can muddle through pretty well.  ELI17: Even declarative languages, like SQL, are Turing complete (thanks to recursive Common Table Expressions). Functional languages, like SAS, became Turing complete after adding macro functionality. Even Excel spreadsheets are Turing complete."

InternetIsBeautiful,3d1f3z,srs_throwaway5302960,2,Mon Jul 13 01:45:07 2015 UTC,Seems the sentiment here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2497146/is-css-turing-complete generally agrees that html and css are not turing complete.
InternetIsBeautiful,3d1f3z,satan-repents,2,Mon Jul 13 01:50:23 2015 UTC,"HTML and CSS are not Turing complete. They are separate markup languages, neither of which are Turing complete.  What you saw in this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak_sWZyHi3E  Is a hack, not a proof that HTML and CSS are turing complete (keep in mind that CSS and HTML rely on the underlying browser, which is written in a Turing complete language, to function - you cannot design an entire underlying web browser and operating system in HTML and CSS alone).  Part of the definition of Turing completeness is that a language must be able to compile/interpret itself (no matter how slow and unwieldy that might be). For example, the gcc C compiler is written in C. PyPy is a Python interpreter written in Python. Etc etc. There are various examples of languages being used to write their own interpreters and compilers.  HTML and CSS cannot do that - not without a lot of help from JavaScript, which IS Turing complete.  So it would be more accurate to say that the Rule 110 demonstration using HTML and CSS rendered in an underlying web browser is Turing complete. HTML and CSS themselves are not."
InternetIsBeautiful,3d1f3z,drakfyre,12,Mon Jul 13 02:00:55 2015 UTC,"It's a fancy way of saying that the language can compute anything that can be computed. You could rewrite Windows 8 or Android or Call of Duty or any other program in ArnoldC. Any program in any other Turing complete language, like C++ or Java could be written in ArnoldC.  What it actually means is that the language can simulate a Turing machine, which is a theoretical computing machine."
InternetIsBeautiful,3d1f3z,rr159,20,Mon Jul 13 04:01:02 2015 UTC,"Yes.  But it would be very painful to do so.

Like the Chef programming language, it is designed to make programs appear to be something other than programs; in this case, Shakespearean plays.  A character list in the beginning of the program declares a number of stacks, naturally with names like ""Romeo"" and ""Juliet"". These characters enter into dialogue with each other in which they manipulate each other's topmost values, push and pop each other, and do I/O. The characters can also ask each other questions which behave as conditional statements. On the whole, the programming model is very similar to assembly language, but more than several amounts more verbose [clarification needed].

InternetIsBeautiful,3d3r3q,Thunder_54,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:02:13 2015 UTC,"Co-developer here, the new youtube API is one seriously impressive piece of code. Once we got the timeline working we questioned even keeping the vimeo/soundcloud support because they're easily 3 years behind in terms of complexity. I love Vimeo though so I'd never abandon it.  Improved SC support is definitely top of the list but at the moment the cleanest mashups are ones with all youtube videos.   tl;dr All Hail The DASH Overlords"

I also think that some of the books are mapping to the wrong titles. It's very rudimentary right now and doesn't seem like it would provide me much value right now.   Having the book summary and title shown after I make a selection is nice. But I don't really like how you can't move the nodes around, some of the titles layer on top of each other and it's annoying to read. Besides all that it's an interesting idea and I wonder where it can go."

If this person is malicious they could later alter it to include code that steals passwords or session cookies. The script is transmitted without TLS (https). A malicious third party could redirect your requests for this script to a malicious version.

Advertised as ""L'automobile pour tous"",  the car was powered by a 1240cc, 12 hp (8.9 kW) two-stroke Thomas engine and used a 2-speed epicyclic transmission. The car featured electric lights and starter. The vehicle was launched as a 4-seat tourer (the catalog also mentioned a 2-seat coupe) in March 1919 at a cost of 4750 francs. Plans for mass production went unrealized, and in March 1920 it was announced that the company had merged with the Société des Moteurs Thomas.

The thing about Cage is that he is an actor that isn't afraid to go for it.  He is willing to completely let loose when acting and needs a director that is able to reign him in.  So sometimes you get great movies, other times you get Face/Off or Vampire's Kiss."

It was once believed that in 1912, he brought a wax cylinder recording device, which he had borrowed from his friend Charles Edison, to the home of former President Teddy Roosevelt, and convinced Roosevelt to speak into it.  However, this pivotal event occurred on March 4, 1913, according to Allen Koenigsberg's latest published research. Thus began Vincent's private collection of voice recordings of notable individuals and witnesses to history.  In 1922, after graduating from Yale, he joined Edison Laboratories.  and worked in the restoration and preservation of antique recordings.     Relevant: R.

I could get my score down to a sustainable level if I laid off the dairy a bit (you'll never take away my eggs!!) which would probably do me some good, take less taxis and if I rethink when I use my heater.  Perhaps it's affected regionally?  Y'know, based on how electricity is generated in the area or something?  EDIT:  Yes, it is regional.  I just re-took the quiz and said I was in the USA.  Using all the same answers I got 3.5 Earths instead.    Before everyone says it's a conspiracy against the US, it may be to do with how food is manufactured and transported in the US, energy generation, maybe you get more electricity and gas for the money I spend in Australia on the same thing, what's allowed in your fuel, how your public transport is powered, etc.  Rather than an individual problem, it could be to do with the way things are run systemically.  And also, people in greener states in the US are getting averaged out with less ecologically conscious states.

InternetIsBeautiful,3clj6c,argybargy3j,5,Thu Jul 9 06:48:26 2015 UTC,"In their FAQ   Why can’t I get my Footprint score within the means of one planet?  A person’s Ecological Footprint includes both personal and societal impacts. The Footprint associated with food, mobility, and goods is easier for you to directly influence through lifestyle choices (eating less meat, driving less, etc). However a person’s Footprint also includes societal impacts or “services”, such as government assistance, roads and infrastructure, public services, and the military of the country that they live in. All citizens of the country are allocated their share of these societal impacts.  The Footprint of these societal impacts (i.e. the “services” category of your Footprint score) does not vary, and therefore in some nations it is not possible to reduce your Footprint to below one planet.  This is why, if we want to achieve sustainability, we need to focus on two things: both our own lifestyle as well as influencing our governments. Even with significant changes in individual behavior, a large portion of a personal Footprint comes from the way national infrastructure is designed, goods are produced, and government and public services operate.  In order to allow their citizens to achieve a lifestyle that fits within one planet, governments need to dramatically improve the efficiency of the built environment and invest in renewable energy and smart land-use planning.heir FAQ"

Manual labor increases CO2 emissions. A cow does more damage with methane than a car (average driving) does with CO2. Local farming is inefficient, and can use more energy per crop eaten than buying from a grocery store.  The best way to be green would be to use solar, electric power tools and vehicles to eliminate labor, build only using inorganics and self raised plant life, do not own animals or have children, and plant more vegetation than you can eat."

It looks like something from 2005 combined with a cool background (I like that part) on the start page. Its annoying trying to find information on the site, the text is hard to read and so on.

She is just stylistic, not 'more advanced'. Björk does strange Björk things and some people like that and some people don't. It would be pretentious only if she weren't so genuinely strange."
InternetIsBeautiful,3cghfd,sykelone,3,Wed Jul 8 12:26:38 2015 UTC,"hey, well you dont have to ""get"" everything really. as a fan of hers i think that its okay and pretty common for people to share your sentiments.  i think with björk it is really a love it or hate it situation. but i believe she is actually very honest and down to earth. most ppl will think she is pretentious cos she is over the top, but i would argue, she is just slightly weird, and she indulges in it, as in, she does not restrain herself in that sense. i think part of her charm is that she is genuinely strange and that surfaces in whatever she does, especially in her music. this is why i believe there is no such music like björk music. because of what she does, many islandic acts are able to break internationally, because she opened up this niche in mainstream music.  i dont know if i can explain it well, but her music is really a performance, check this out now an opera hall you think, this is really over the top, but i think unlike really pretentious artists (like those for example who try to sell you tidal) she really believes in what she does, as in, she takes the ""artistic"" approach of expression. combine her music, the melody and words and beats and strange noises, you can see why IT IS important for her to sit there and let you absorb the scene. there is no other way to do it. if you are interested, i think the vespertine tour is one of the most amazing musical experience one can have..  sidenote: do you know she was in a relationship to matthew barney and works with equally ""idiosyncratic"" artistes? i only mentioned him cos he is equally weird.  sorry for the rant, but i think in the end, either you like her music or you dont. she is just an individual who is not afraid to express herself. whether or not she is selling herself due to this is really secondary to what she achieves. at least she has been consistent and it seems unlikely that she can be otherwise. cheers"

She's my favourite artist but I'm very hesitant to recommend her to someone new because I know it's a completely different style and I can see why some people wouldn't like it. I just love how she uses different media to express herself and her art and all of that ends up complementing her music. It's really beautiful to me.

InternetIsBeautiful,3cghfd,davidrias,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:43:31 2015 UTC,"Gling-Gló:       Gling-Gló, released in 1990, is the only album by Björk Guðmundsdóttir & tríó Guðmundar Ingólfssonar, consisting of Björk Guðmundsdóttir on vocals, Guðmundar Ingólfsson on piano, Guðmundur Steingrímsson on drums, and Þórður Högnason on bass. Gling-Gló is an Icelandic onomatopoeia whose English equivalent is ""Ding Dong,"" or the sound that a bell makes.  This album was recorded on 1 September and 3 September 1990 at Stúdio Sýrland. It was produced by Tómas Magnús Tómasson, the bassist of Stuðmenn, who also did the mix for this album. Whereas, “Ruby Baby” and “I Can't Help Loving that Man” were recorded on August 23, 1990 on Ríkisútvarpið (National Icelandic Broadcasting Service). The recordings were made for Djasskaffi, a radio programme hosted by Ólafur Þórðarsson.  Gling-Gló contains Icelandic themes, and most of the songs are sung in Icelandic. There are also five versions of English language songs by other artists: “Ruby Baby,” by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, and the jazz standard “I Can’t Help Loving That Man”, by Oscar Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern; and in Icelandic “Það sést ekki sætari mey”, which means in English “There Is No Sweeter Girl”, and is misattributed in the album notes and on the CD as having been written by ""Rogers/Hammerstein"", but is in reality a completely reworded cover of ""You Can't Get a Man with a Gun"" by Irving Berlin from the famous musical Annie Get Your Gun. There is also the Icelandic version of Sway, Í dansi með þér. Additionally, ""Bílavísur"" is a reworked rendition of ""The Blacksmith Blues,"" first performed by Ella Mae Morse. ""Ég veit ei hvað skal segja"" is also a reworked rendition of ""Ricochet Romance"", performed by the likes of June Carter Cash and Teresa Brewer. The title ""Pabbi minn"" is an Icelandic version of ""O Mein Papa"".

You almost never detect the browser by user agent. If you ever do that, you're probably doing something dumb. Modernizr can help for more complex detection and with polyfills. Browser fanboys who want everyone to use their favourite browser(s). Or sometimes they just couldn't be bothered testing other browsers (perfectly understandable) and decide that other users shouldn't even get to see if it works (not so understandable). Most well made sites will instead issue a warning that the browser isn't officially supported and might not work correctly.

A few notes on the way our maps display data:   Currently the map shows blue/yellow for poor signal, red for great signal, and (crucially) blank for where we have no data. This is a bit confusing - understandably some people assume the blank parts of the map are for no signal! We are currently redesigning our maps, and it should be a lot more intuitive within a few weeks. We are currently running some designs past some beta testers, so if you are interesting in helping please message me!  The map tiles show just the average signal level. While the ranking is based on a bunch of metrics, including signal,  download speed, upload speed and latency. That's why sometimes a network that looks like it has less coverage will be ranked higher.   Any questions please lmk either here, or email me sam@."

InternetIsBeautiful,3cbrtc,hannibalhooper14,2,Tue Jul 7 09:30:47 2015 UTC,It will run in the background in default mode (in a way that shouldn't use much battery) but you can control this in the settings: both turning it off and bumping up the data collection routine like our power users do.  We do indeed see the network of both your SIM and the connected network so this allows us to understand when users are roaming or on an MVNO.

Ookla are really testing maximum possible throughput whereas we are aiming to test typical throughput. Therefore there are a number of methodology choices we make that are different e.g. Ookla will often connect you to a server that is extremely close to you, probably more close than you would get if you were just browsing the internet.  We run our tests of popular CDNs so we do have servers over the world (to remove geographical bias) but we don't place the servers right next to the user.  There are a series of similar methodology choices that you make to design a speedtest and we want ours to represent the actual speed you will get when you use your device.  However, both methods are very valid and it's useful to test both."

InternetIsBeautiful,3cbrtc,I_drive_all_over,13,Mon Jul 6 23:21:00 2015 UTC,"Hi Sam u/opensignal, rf guy here. Can you quantify ""poor"", "" good"" etc...  10 MHz RSRP at -115 dBm is still acceptable but -115 dBm RSCP would be unusable.   Edit: I actually have a ton of questions.  What rate do you bin at?    Do old bins get referenced against new ones?   Is signal quality taken into account when reporting coverage?   Double validation is tricky but if your pulling the info directly from the phones there are some formulas you can use to get an signal strength adjustment based on signal quality."
InternetIsBeautiful,3cbrtc,At_least_im_Bacon,6,Mon Jul 6 21:37:55 2015 UTC,"Hi /u/At_least_im_Bacon.   For 2G/3G Android only reports RSSI, in units of ASU (0-32). For our maps we just do a graduated scale blue-red using these values. 4G we get RSRP, and again do a graduated scale using (I think) ~-140 to -50 dB.   I'm not sure what you mean by binning. Can you elaborate? (I'm not an rf guy :-) )"
InternetIsBeautiful,3cbrtc,opensignal,4,Mon Jul 6 22:57:58 2015 UTC,"Sure, first I'd like to thank you for coming to Reddit and providing this avenue of feedback.   Binning is essentially averaging based on time or distance. A phone will typically take many samples a second and plotting all of those points can lead to an unreadable mess.   Typically the type of binning is performed based on the method of collection. If you wanted to look at data collected while walking you would want to bin based on distance ( 1 meter for example ) if your are driving your view is likely to cover a much wider area and your velocity may not allow for a 1 meter bin so you could bin at a 1 second interval or at a 10 meter interval.   Data is binned at the post processing stage and the binned data can then be delimited by some values.   In your application if you have multiple users scan the same area how is this transfered ? Do we see last value or an average of all users in that area?  When it comes to your gradient I've found that unless your signal to noise is very good a reading of <-115 dBm RSRP is not reliable.  This why we often do a signal level adjustment based on signal quality.  -85 RSRP at a SINR of -6 dB is going to lead to very poor throughput.  -95 dBm RSRP at a SINR of 10dB will lend itself to some very decent speeds.    I'm fairly certain I've been using open signal since Android 2.1. Android has made bast improvements to sinal metric polling since then. You should be able to pull rssi without asu  conversion for CDMA, RSCP for umts, and RSRP for LTE."

For instance a 10 square mile around my childhood home shows zero coverage on this map but has pretty good Verizon and AT&T coverage."
InternetIsBeautiful,3cbrtc,mixduptransistor,29,Mon Jul 6 20:56:32 2015 UTC,"I'm one of the founders of the site. Just want to say that we know that we don't have data absolutely everywhere but the reason we started OpenSignal is because although the mobile operators show maps with coverage over a larger area they are based on predicted coverage and they aren't actually able to measure coverage in all those areas (and the tendency is to overestimate coverage).  Our goal is to build a purely empirical map so that we can confidently say that where we mark coverage, you can be sure that there is coverage (or vice versa - we can also record areas that we confirm don't have coverage).  This model relies on the power of the crowd to help us build up this map but we've had over 13million people download the app so far and if enough people download the app and contribute data we can build the definitive source of data on wireless coverage. We want to change the information balance in the wireless industry so that you don't have to rely on operators telling you that they have coverage in a particular area but put the information in your hands so you make the best decision on which operators is best for you based on real world data from other users of the app.  Note - we've got loads of improvements to the coverage maps planned over the next few months. If you have any additional feature requests please let us know, we'd love to hear from you!

InternetIsBeautiful,3cbrtc,baffler,2,Mon Jul 6 19:45:20 2015 UTC,"Well, the thing is... predicted coverage is going to be tremendously more precise than this, even if it's not perfect.

InternetIsBeautiful,3cbrtc,VMX,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:52:27 2015 UTC,Operators know the location of all their sites   You'd be surprised! We've spoken to operators who actually don't. Or at least their database is fragmented over a number of different files in different formats in different departments.  It's worth mentioning that we also have the option of building predictive coverage maps based on the large amount of empirical data we have that would make things a lot more precise.  Also one of the big advantages is that we have a unified methodology across all operators in all countries. Currently the maps provided by operators are completely incomparable as there is no way to calibrate them which makes it impossible for consumers.
InternetIsBeautiful,3cbrtc,bmdgill,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:21:56 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised! We've spoken to operators who actually don't.   Haha, well... I guess those are networks managed by the infrastructure vendor instead of the operator itself... which means all optimization tasks, etc. are externalized. This is usually a synonym for extremely poor performance :)   Currently the maps provided by operators are completely incomparable as there is no way to calibrate them which makes it impossible for consumers.   I guess that depends on which tool they're using, but in general I think it should be fairly similar for all of them.  I work in the field, and not only do (most) operators know the estimated coverage (i.e.: RSCP for 3G, RSRP for 4G). They can also split those estimates between outdoor and indoor coverage, taking into account the attenuation introduced by buildings in the area.  They also cross-reference this data with the available spectrum in 3G or 4G to estimate the available cell throughput  (i.e.: 1 Mbps, 3 Mbps, 5 Mbps, 10 Mbps, etc.), which provides a much more relevant metric for customer experience.  You're right however that most of them don't show this level of detail externally to customers, and probably keep it for internal analysis only.  And of course, you still want to perform drive tests in different areas to measure things empirically in the field and take into account things like congestion, etc., although this can indeed be more expensive to do.  I think the most valuable thing about OpenSignal is the fact that the info is so easily accessible for all users. I personally believe there's a lot of potential for mobile operators in the crowd-sourcing field, and collecting info from the handset through apps is a great approach. I work in the field and I've seen this coming for many years.  After all... why go to the street and measure things yourself with a car when you have thousands of customers walking down the streets with RSRP-meters in their pockets?  A pity that you still don't have that many users ouside the US ;)"

I guess those are networks managed by the infrastructure vendor instead of the operator itself... which means all optimization tasks, etc. are externalized.

After all... why go to the street and measure things yourself with a car when you have thousands of customers walking down the streets with RSRP-meters in their pockets?   Couldn't agree more! This is often how we pitch OpenSignal...  Indoor/outdoor coverage is something the operators do using very broad assumptions and pretty basic calibration. Indoor is an area that operators don't (generally) have any access to large scale empirical data. Buildings vary massively in terms of RF penetration and so a lot of their estimates are really not much better than guesses.  This is one of the areas operators have most interest in our data and we're looking at ways we can use sensors on the device to determine when measurements are taken indoors so that we can start bringing empirical data to measuring indoor coverage on a vary large scale. According to certain stats (e.g. OfCom) more than 50% of mobile usage occurs indoors these days so it's extremely important!"

I work for a pretty big one (we have MNOs in many many countries) and in our case most of the optimization, etc. is still done in-house. A pity that so many operators are saving costs by externalizing... but that actually gives us an edge (which is very visible in network benchmarks), so I guess that's good for us :)  And yeah I agree about indoor. You can assume certain dB's of attenuation, but in the end it's nothing more than a guess as each building is a different beast.  You gotta try and do some marketing in Europe ;)"

I always thought the coverage was good enough on Virgin/Boost but later into my service I found out that my wife was not getting calls and texts. I thought she was just terrible with tech but that wasn't the case. Att was just a hair better than T-Mobile and far worse than either of the two Sprint carriers. Verizon...never had a signal problem. Also 34mb download speed on lte. I just tested it. The most I got with Att or Sprint was like 9. So this site is a good idea. However, I do not trust the data."

Even the old GSM and UMTS technologies are constantly being updated and tweaked to maximize their full potential.

We actually just had this problem a few weeks ago when a storm hit the east coast, with a tornado touching down in New Jersey.  AT&T has a massive generator yard, and various contractors are called to rush to sites to install generators in order to keep the sites online until commercial power is restored.    Having said that, you'll still see a lot of outages, either due to trees blocking the access roads, battery systems not working as expected, etc.  In high priority locations all of the main carriers have a number of 'mobile' cell sites, with a small telescoping tower equipped with antennas to cover a high traffic area.

Just to verify, your data-set about Metro is in fact incomplete or does Metro really suck that bad?  Isn't Metro using the towers of other operators like T-Mobile iirc? When so then T-mobile seems to, according to the map, have pretty decent coverage which on the other hand isn't really what people that I know with T-Mobile would say about it."

InternetIsBeautiful,3c98pq,belgarion_riva,2,Mon Jul 6 15:01:54 2015 UTC,I wonder why only two dwarf planets were used.
InternetIsBeautiful,3c98pq,MoroccoBotix,2,Mon Jul 6 20:31:26 2015 UTC,"Dwarf planet:       A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of the Sun, and is massive enough for its shape to be in hydrostatic equilibrium under its own gravity, but has not cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.    The term dwarf planet was adopted in 2006 as part of a three-way categorization of bodies orbiting the Sun,  brought about by an increase in discoveries of objects farther away from the Sun than Neptune that rivaled Pluto in size, and finally precipitated by the discovery of an even more massive object, Eris.  The exclusion of dwarf planets from the roster of planets by the IAU has been both praised and criticized; it was said to be the ""right decision"" by astronomer Mike Brown,    who discovered Eris and other new dwarf planets, but has been rejected by Alan Stern,   who had coined the term dwarf planet in 1990.   The International Astronomical Union (IAU) currently recognizes five dwarf planets: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.  Brown criticizes this official recognition: ""A reasonable person might think that this means that there are five known objects in the solar system which fit the IAU definition of dwarf planet, but this reasonable person would be nowhere close to correct.""   It is suspected that another hundred or so known objects in the Solar System are dwarf planets.  Estimates are that up to 200 dwarf planets may be found when the entire region known as the Kuiper belt is explored, and that the number may exceed 10,000 when objects scattered outside the Kuiper belt are considered.  Individual astronomers recognize several of these,  and in August 2011 Mike Brown published a list of 390 candidate objects, ranging from ""nearly certain"" to ""possible"" dwarf planets.* * Brown currently identifies eleven known objects – the five accepted by the IAU plus 2007 OR10, Quaoar, Sedna, Orcus, 2002 MS4 and Salacia – as ""virtually certain"", with another dozen highly likely.  Stern states that there are more than a dozen known dwarf planets.   However, only two of these bodies, Ceres and Pluto, have been observed in enough detail to demonstrate that they actually fit the IAU's definition. The IAU accepted Eris as a dwarf planet because it is more massive than Pluto. They subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 (and hence a diameter of ≥838 km assuming a geometric albedo of ≤1)  are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets.  The only two such objects known at the time, Makemake and Haumea, went through this naming procedure and were declared to be dwarf planets.  The classification of bodies in other planetary systems with the characteristics of dwarf planets has not been addressed.

The real trick is to use a recursive approach that follows a possible path, and crosses out potential combinations, and then doesn't pursue that square again.

I'm even more skeptical that it ran on the brute force method you outlined in your other comment in only a few minutes.  There are 981 possible combinations in such an algorithm and supercomputers tend to operate on the order of quadrillions of floating-point operations a second.  940 / 1018 (this seems extremely generous -- I'm also making the assumption the puzzle is half-solved for you and that you have a super computer far faster than any that are known to the public) yields an order-of-magnitude calculation in the trillions of years (and that's assuming only one floating-point operation per potential solution).

There are plenty of lightning strikes in Europe, and all over the world, which are all displayed by blitzortung as long as the detectors are working. But if you're accessing it from 'Murica, you're going to see your general section of of the cuntry displayed by default.

InternetIsBeautiful,3bsz7c,granitejon,14,Thu Jul 2 03:18:12 2015 UTC,"Pantone. Pantone. Pantone. What used to cost thousands of dollars for hard copies of swatches has now been put into a genius app for about $10 and will let you pull colors from any image and with those colors you will have the universal code for such color. Let let you build pallets, etc and also share those pallets. It's the best thing in the world if you truly love color."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bsz7c,Cait206,15,Thu Jul 2 09:20:14 2015 UTC,"Is that why it says ""sorry no results""?"
InternetIsBeautiful,3bsz7c,HumidNebula,15,Thu Jul 2 11:22:37 2015 UTC,Thousands? Maybe hundreds. Hard copies are still essential to print design.
InternetIsBeautiful,3bsz7c,chimichanga9,5,Thu Jul 2 10:46:37 2015 UTC,"THIS. I meet designers all the time who look at proofs on their computer and think that is exactly how the finished print is going to look. The whole idea of having the the swatches with a code is so that the color can be looked up by both the designer and printer to be certain both sides know what to expect.   Despite this, soooo many ""freelance"" graphic designers don't bother with pantone codes. As a designer and printer myself this is a constant point of contention with other designers."

(It was ""desktop publishing"" back then) and Pantone was an ESSENTIAL tool for a designer. As in, you'd need a print set of Pantone swatches before you bought something fancy like a scanner or printer. Now, people are taught/learn from the first day that ""everything is digital""."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bsz7c,flashvenom,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:18:15 2015 UTC,"Well for one it is really useful for clients. You can have them sign off on a color, after they physically look at it.   I particularly like using the SPOT/PROCESS conversions while designing.  I guess you can proof things other ways, I have never had the luxury of an accurate printer before going to offset, I don't even know if that is possible. Of course you can proof for layout, scale, etc. but color is hugely important too of course.  preaching to the choir"

InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,Mechanical_Garden,2039,Wed Jul 1 10:24:35 2015 UTC,wtf? I got a score of 24 with 1 error. Here's the catch: I am colorblind in real life.  Edit: Am I famous now?
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,Accidental_Ouroboros,971,Wed Jul 1 12:24:05 2015 UTC,"Ya, I got 32. I think it has to do with all the surrounding boxes being the same color instead of a jumble of bubbles. It seems less like a test for color blindness and more like one to test how well ou distinguish shades?"
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,InsertAnotherCoin,614,Wed Jul 1 04:36:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah hence I tagged it as ""colour vision sensitivity"". Hope that eases some confusion. I'm sure its less of a diagnostic tool and more of a game. Unless they somehow have some serious data on a hawk's eyesight correlation to this particular test."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,ImAdolfHitler,490,Wed Jul 1 04:48:53 2015 UTC,"The funny thing is, a profoundly colorblind person - the very rare person who has true Monochromacy - would perform just fine in this test. It is not so much that it is testing how well you distinguish color, but rather how well you distinguish levels of brightness.  If I converted every single test on there to greyscale, you would probably do better on the test than you could in color, because the color changes from test to test would no longer be a confusing factor (and would limit whatever effects the quality of your screen has on your performance).  It is definitely more of a game than a real diagnostic tool."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,GabrielsTrumpet,98,Wed Jul 1 04:51:23 2015 UTC,"Can confirm, flipped settings to grayscale and score went from 23 to 35 and speed for the first 20 or so increased drastically."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,beniceorbevice,98,Wed Jul 1 06:08:36 2015 UTC,"I had a different experience. With and without a greyscale, I got 21. When I turned up my monitor's contrast and quit F.lux, I got to 58 (at that point it's just a matter of being quick enough).  I think this is more a test of your monitor than your eyes. The better the color discrimination, the better the result."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,TotesMessenger,123,Wed Jul 1 06:54:27 2015 UTC,"I hate to agree with Hitler, but in this case I think he is correct. More of a test of your monitor and f.lux. I got pretty different scores when I switched between my monitors (one a fairly new IPS panel gave me a better score, my older plain ol' LED backlit monitor gave me a lower score). Toggling f.lux also dramatically affected my score."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,SoberJed,16,Wed Jul 1 08:44:20 2015 UTC,"I had my phone display on lowest and got stuck at 10, turned up my display brightness and kept going till 24, big difference"

InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,MonkeyDDuffy,30,Wed Jul 1 06:26:50 2015 UTC,29 - Hawk. Totally red/green colourblind.
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,Accountw0t,7,Wed Jul 1 05:07:23 2015 UTC,Awesome ! This test actually measures only color desaturation sensitivity. Affected in optic neuritis and papilledema. Not for congenital colorblind for which Farnsworth Munsell or Isihara is appropriate.
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,disc_addict,42,Wed Jul 1 06:18:59 2015 UTC,"Really? Well I guess this test measures the level of contrast you can distinguish between two shades of a single colour. So it doesn't need you to distinguish between red and green, for example."

I did it one more time to see if it was a fluke the first time around and got zero again. It's kinda cool how when I finished a row I could almost see a chain-like thing in the middle of the boxes connecting from one end to the other.
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,ZDTreefur,7,Wed Jul 1 07:24:21 2015 UTC,Like a spooky dark colored chain? I could see that too.
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,MrBinns,3,Wed Jul 1 06:51:12 2015 UTC,This 'chain' you see is a moire pattern that's produced from the monitor generating that color gradient.  If you move your head around the chain should change in intensity.  It is formed from the slightly different configuration and intensities of the individual pixels in your monitor.  Pretty neat actually.  And I used it to cheat when the colors were too close ;)
InternetIsBeautiful,3bptgf,Neetox,6,Wed Jul 1 13:53:36 2015 UTC,This one's great! I got 35. And it said the best (lowest) score for other ladies in my age range is -80. Seems fishy.

InternetIsBeautiful,3bqg14,Shardic,7,Wed Jul 1 09:59:57 2015 UTC,You can filter the stories on the main page by genre. There is currently no way of 'locking' a story unfortunately but it is something my husband is thinking about adding.
InternetIsBeautiful,3bqg14,Hayes231,3,Wed Jul 1 10:08:58 2015 UTC,"what do the numbers on the right of the stories mean?  edit: also, it would be really cool if you could link back into a main branch from a side branch, like if the character went on a tagent, but came back at a later point in the main story to continue it"
InternetIsBeautiful,3bqg14,Hayes231,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:47:07 2015 UTC,"On the contents page the numbers are the page number of that story. It's a bit confusing because the page numbers are randomly allocated so in the table of contents they aren't in order.   He's also had that suggestion before, too, about being able to link back to another part of the story. The way that the website is structured it is currently impossible to do this, but he is considering re-structuring the website at a later date if there is enough demand."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bqg14,Hayes231,2,Thu Jul 2 04:00:01 2015 UTC,oh! i thought it meant how many pages were in the particular story. so the smaller the number the earlier it was written?
InternetIsBeautiful,3bqg14,Hayes231,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:03:08 2015 UTC,"Generally yes. There may be stories where it was randomly allocated a smaller number than the previous story. So the first story is at page 1. Then the second story might be at page 3. Then the third story might be at page 6. Then the fourth story might be at page 2. But on the whole, each story will get a larger page number given if it is written later. This probably isn't a very good explanation as I can't remember exactly how my husband allocates the page numbers.... sorry :-S"

I think his reasoning was that Dendrite is meant to mirror a Choose Your Own Adventure book - where each story starts part-way through the book. I asked him and he said that later stories DO have larger page numbers, but they aren't consecutive (so it could jump from page 1 to page 3, then page 15, then page 35, then page 200, etc). The stories in the table of contents are organised by 'likes' (which you can see if you create an account) and number of pages."

I will also keep checking this thread for any feedback. The site works fine with JPEG and PNG images. When entering an image via URL make sure the image host is CORS enabled. A safe bet is imgur. It should always work when uploading images from the file selector or drag and drop. Thanks for any feedback, hope this can be of use to a few people.   Stop letting blogspam sites steal your original content! Use Snoomark to watermark your images.  EDIT: Thanks /u/Spriangle for making an example image. http://i.imgur.com/SsFvgIN.jpg"

InternetIsBeautiful,3bkebp,TwerpOco,4,Tue Jun 30 01:41:24 2015 UTC,"Clicking Outside-In the ""outside"" clicking causes the sunlight to focus on certain things, and you can unlock little easter egg videos of birds and such (and of bugs mating). This only works when the white guy is not in flight mode, otherwise it will only play a note. While in a video, clicking will flash the screen black very briefly and play a high note. While running or walking, clicking will light up the path. While clicking in the second time outside, it will briefly cause the guide to go transparent. If you click on the other dark figure a splash of color and music will play. While in the ""third outside"" when you meet three dark figures, clicking will cause them to play a note and color will stream from their heads into the sky, changing its color. From what I can see, no videos are unlockable in the third outside.  Clicking Other World-makes the white guy toggle from transparent to opaque and plays a music note (while in free mode). Clicking while running/walking will create a transparent copy of the white guy in that instance and play a note (you can see these copies when you visit a second time). While standing still, the ""sun"" will focus on certain areas, unlocking videos like in the ""outside."" The trees always move when you click, running or standing still. In the ""second other world"" when you visit again, clicking will toggle between the outside and the other world.  Mouse Movement-causes the white guy to either move around you or if you look up, he will fly. Also moves the camera.  Spacebar-pressing the spacebar will cause the white guy to jump while on the ground and play a note when he hits the ground. While the white guy is in flight mode, spacebar will make him loop.  W- w is normal walking speed.  E-w is fast walking speed.  Esc- pauses the simulation (the white guy sits down in some areas).  It seems that any letter key will exit a video you are watching and let you continue on your journey.  Please let me know if I missed anything! Thanks :)  Edit: Found some new stuff, added it to the list."

InternetIsBeautiful,3bnunb,the-artifice,2,Tue Jun 30 18:42:46 2015 UTC,"What is views.red?  Ever wondered much views your reddit posts generate? With this tool, you can find out. Simply insert the URL you would like to share, grab the returned URL and post it to reddit.   Using the reddit api, it will display the title of the post and gather total views, comments, and points. The title links back to the source reddit post so visitor can comment and vote...  It will also check the top posts of the day and allow you to navigate through them via a Next button.   Here is an example post.   How does it work?  It does not store any personal data whatsoever. It simply increases the view count whenever a new visitor appears.   Its magic has less to do with the concept, but more with how it achieves it by using least amount of resources for performance (quick loading of the page which is essential).  My experience with optimisation comes from creating The Artifice, a magazine focusing on in-depth articles about film, anime, games, comics etc. This is a high trafficed platform with no advertising so costs must be kept to absolute minimum.   views.red is optimised via:  -> Everything is cached. Values are updated once every 10 minutes. And all numeric data is stored in an array in one row in the db.   -> Everything is minified (css/html...).  -> No javascript or jQuery is loaded.  -> Minimal amounts of requests.   -> No images are loaded.   -> Browser caching enabled.   ... and so on.  It is currently running on a basic VPS and can be upgraded and scaled when needed.   The interesting part is that it's coded on WordPress. I will release the source code so that anyone can simply add the theme and launch their own clone.   It all sounds good, now what's the catch?  Well, some subreddits require that you post the direct link to the content (please read the respective subreddit rules).   Some sites does not allow frames (iframe in this case). So if the page is showing blank, this will be the reason. I can implement a system in the future where it detects if the source blocks frames.  Other than that, it just needs some traffic so that I can test how it performs. As anyone who codes knows, you can prepare it for traffic, but it's a whole different gig once you're there.   I think this tool is particularly useful if you want to track views for articles or if you want your reddit title to be displayed on the page.   Hope someone finds it useful. :-D"

It was a dumb movie (in a really entertaining way), so it's not like there was much he could do with it, but he was just fun to watch.  Which is pretty much how I felt about Guardians.  Mind you, I still haven't got around to watching Parks & Rec so I have no basis for comparison."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bdylq,notleonardodicaprio,3,Sun Jun 28 20:09:34 2015 UTC,"Oh man you should get on that. Parks and Rec is one of the best comedy shows I've seen.

InternetIsBeautiful,3bdylq,Lesook,2,Sun Jun 28 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you for that.  One of the things that has kept me from trying it is the many comments of ""it starts out slow"", but it's difficult to know before starting a show if you can skip and if so, where to start."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bdylq,sivadneb,11,Sun Jun 28 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"Good point. He was really great in Guardians and perfect for the role. He was just ok in Jurassic World. It's just that on TV he seems to have more freedom to improvise, and that's when he really shines."
InternetIsBeautiful,3bdylq,ElderScrolls,7,Sun Jun 28 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"While I think its probably true the actors have a little more freedom in TV than in movies, simply because of the pacing, scripting, etc (though improv does certainly happen in movies, as well), I don't think there's any indication it impacts his quality.   The only thing to go on in that regard is Jurassic World, and I think the film was the limiter there. Personally, I think Pratt is similar to Steve Carell with better looks. He's fun to watch and usually does good work, but I don't think he's ever going to be Pacino or Jackson, and I don't think that's what he's aiming for either."

I don't think they've ever elaborated any more on the plan.

InternetIsBeautiful,3b2tym,MattAU05,27,Thu Jun 25 19:31:04 2015 UTC,"I bought a use (""good"" quality) from Amazon about a year ago. Just a little TV for my kids' playroom. I paid around $160 for it. When I got it, it worked fine, but it rattled. Like someone put something pretty big in there, or something pretty big detached and was moving around. It was just one object, not a bunch of small ones. Very strange. I emailed Amazon Customer Service and told them about the problem. I told them I either needed to return it for a replacement, or they could credit me with 50% of the purchase price. Much to my pleasant surprise, they just credited 50% of the purchase price back to me. And that's not the first time Amazon has basically resolved an issue precisely as I suggested (which is how I ended up with two of the same Furby for my daughter). I got a TV, they didn't have to replace a product. Everyone is happy. And I didn't even have to intentionally damage the TV to do it.  I don't know if they're that cool with everyone, but their customer service makes me keep going back. Same with Audible (who is owned by Amazon). Good customer service means a lot."
InternetIsBeautiful,3b2tym,eeyore134,12,Thu Jun 25 20:19:39 2015 UTC,"Amazon is pretty great with returns and customer service in general.  I had a friend order something, a $20 cord or some such I think, and it was the wrong one.  Told her to just keep the cord and refunded her money.  I've had to return a couple Kindles in the past and never had a problem with those either.  It's like they realize keeping their customers happy over a small thing today will turn into more profits from them later.  It's too bad most companies don't.  Though I have to say, I ordered some Gargoyles sunglasses the other day direct from their site.  The box came, looked tampered with, and sure enough I had an empty sunglasses case in the box.  I expected a huge hassle but called and the woman on the other end was shocked and very apologetic, had a new pair shipped out to me within 5 minutes no questions asked.  This was yesterday so I haven't received them, but it's customer service like that which will keep me coming back... assuming I actually get them."

InternetIsBeautiful,3b2tym,AWildSegFaultAppears,106,Thu Jun 25 22:19:03 2015 UTC,"There is a difference between ""dead"" and ""stuck"" pixels. Dead pixels are usually not fixable.  They are almost always black pixels that have become broken, usually because the transistor was either faulty or malfunctioned so that pixel doesn't get power.    Stuck pixels are different.  They are usually pixels that for some reason have one or all of the colors that remain on at all times.  Sometimes by rapidly changing the color of the pixel and doing so for a while, you can get the pixel to reset itself and function correctly.  Often pixels such as these will become ""stuck"" at a later date."

InternetIsBeautiful,3avasl,DeanDahBean,-3,Sun Jun 28 20:31:06 2015 UTC,Streaming music is awesome except for artists. They get paid very little ($0.005 for a 30 second play).

InternetIsBeautiful,3avasl,playnary,5,Tue Jun 23 22:56:45 2015 UTC,"The band who made it claims otherwise:   Ohm & Sport is confident that using Eternify is well within their rights. In a statement to Forbes, the band said, “It is not a hack, not an attempt to game or trick Spotify, but simply a different and more responsible approach to streaming.”     Source  Obviously, playing random songs for 30 seconds is just a 'more responsible' way of listening to music."
InternetIsBeautiful,3avasl,playnary,5,Wed Jun 24 13:33:14 2015 UTC,Spotify is just a delivery medium. It therefore seems a bit narcissistic that a band should throw a hissy fit because Spotify don't promote them as the next best thing. Why not try good old fashioned promotion if you want people to listen to your music instead of blaming the means of delivery. It's like somebody in the 1970s blaming the record shop for not pushing their music. Music used to be promoted via the radio and TV in the past - why not use the ample other means of promotion open to you?
InternetIsBeautiful,3avasl,Cyndle95,2,Thu Jun 25 10:16:13 2015 UTC,"This might be a farce. Maybe the metrics of Eternify are just a hoax and what you hear is just the preview of an album that Spotify rolls out for free via the API for users who are not logged in.. (do they do that? somebody?) Why am i saying that?   There's a couple of questions here. First, how do they do it? The Spotify-API should restrict streams to one instance for every user (so for example you can't use spotify on your smartphone and your notebook at the same time). And you'd need to have an account in the first place. Still you can open eternify in mutliple tabs (= multiple instances) and even if you are not logged in with Spotify. So, which Spotify-User is actually ""listening"" when you start Eternify?  Second: As pointed out by Horrours_of_Secks, the songs start in the middle of the track. This is somewhat unusual and unnecessary.. Does the app make extra calculations to finde a point somewhere in the track, but with enough time left to have the required 30 seconds? Why?  And third: i already generated 6000-7000 plays for a small artist to see if the ""realtime"" Spotify play counts would go up (the artist had less than 1000 plays before that) - which they didn't. Now, ""realtime"" might be misleading here, since we don't know whether Spotify actually gives a shit to show realtime play counts or does this with a delay - for example to rule out big anomalies like automated listening tools... Actually, this is almost certain since me playing that band in the native Spotify App doesn't change that counter as well, as i just discovered. But still.  Hm, anyone with more insight into the API and what might be going on here?"
InternetIsBeautiful,3avasl,CodyTechery,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:17:33 2015 UTC,"Also, if you cut your connection after starting the counter, it will still happily continue counting. Errm, nope. My money is on fake."
InternetIsBeautiful,3avasl,ilikelotsathings,5,Thu Jun 25 21:35:26 2015 UTC,"This doesn't seem very legit.  The base rate per play is 0.7 cents per play.  Doesn't seem like that much.  But if someone left it running for an entire week, they'd make over $140.  And you can mute the track so what's stopping people from leaving 5 tabs open instead of 1?  What about 15 tabs?  If someone had this open in 15 tabs and ran it 24/7, that'd be $100k a year by doing absolutely nothing.  Yeah, don't think so."
InternetIsBeautiful,3avasl,Cyndle95,-6,Thu Jun 25 00:17:16 2015 UTC,"I don't think you understand what this is, nor what Spotify is. You don't earn money for using Spotify, artists do. And at that rate, it still isn't much money for them. This is a tool to help artists using Spotify to earn more money for them."
InternetIsBeautiful,3avasl,Horrours_of_Secks,5,Thu Jun 25 00:48:14 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty confident OP is saying ""[an artist] would make over $140.."" etc."

I was referring to all artists, but the reason it may have sounded directed towards myself is because I relate to it.  It's not hard to get a song up on spotify.  I'm an amateur producer myself.  All I would have to do is get one of my songs up on spotify that I spent 10-20 hours making.  Then even if that song was complete shit, I could still make $100k a year doing exactly what I mentioned before.  Which is exactly why I say that this isn't legit.

You can write fast and scalable network applications. It's event-driven and lightweight.  I use Redis to save session data so people logged in are kept logged in if they come back later. It's a simple, fast and scalable key-value database.  Socket.io for remote control. If someone is logged in they can make a QR-code and control the player using a phone for example. I had some fun with that where I had two speakers on two laptops in different rooms and I could sync up the music using the remote control feature.  Backbone as an architecture. I liked that I could separate Views and Collections and there are some useful built-in features. It doesn't mess with any other data like Angular would or control how you write your code too much.  I simply like writing in Coffeescript. It works well with Backbone too where I could easily great classes or use arrow functions. The code becomes a bit cleaner.  Less is a CSS pre-processor. If you don't know what it is, you have to try it. You can use variables and nest selectors.  Grunt is the tool that builds everything. I compile my less and coffee here and listen on changes to my code where they are immediately compiled and the browser is reloaded. It's also has a production build where I minify and concatenate files so it uses less bandwidth.  Jade is a cleaner way to write HTML and a templating language. It has mixins and what not. I love using it and hate writing HTML without it.  Express is the server, I set up the backend as a MVC with it like Kraken does. Everything is seperated in their own module.  Passport with my own extension handles the Reddit login.  Lodash helps with writing functional javascript. Making it really easy to work with arrays and collections."

InternetIsBeautiful,3ap1bm,madjo,10,Mon Jun 22 14:11:39 2015 UTC,"Project's been started in December 2013. Had a basic version in a few weeks. In April I started on a new version that just throws everything away what I had earlier and summer 2014 I had a new version. I've left that where it was until this June where I added some tweaks.  So a few days of time where I wake up, drink coffee and work on this until I go back to sleep. Then a few weeks where I work on this for a few hours after school. And then mostly just a hour here or there every few weeks.  Once the crucial part is done it takes less and less time to maintain."
InternetIsBeautiful,3ap1bm,TeddyPeep,23,Tue Jun 23 03:39:17 2015 UTC,"Javascript can be so annoying at times, I wonder if there's a better way to write a this closure. Coffeescript seems popular, I'll learn that.   Personally I never ever use this in JS. I just return objects that capture variables via lexical scoping (closures) to keep track of state. It's much simpler for me to reason about. An example:  var MakePerson = function(name, age) {     name = capitalize(name); // lol just pretend capitalize() exists     return {         name: function() {             return name;         },         setName: function(newName) {             name = capitalize(newName);         },         age: function() {             return age;         },         description: function() {             return name + "", "" + age + "" years old."";         },     }; };   Then you can use it easily:  var person = MakePerson(""bob"", 60); person.setName(""robert""); // this line not needed; just an example console.log(person.description());"

InternetIsBeautiful,3ap1bm,Godspeedingticket,41,Mon Jun 22 23:03:04 2015 UTC,"You make a cool swimming pool in your back yard and invite friends over. As more people show up, your pool fills up with people, and your newly arriving friends have to start waiting for a turn to get in. Eventually, your pool has too much stress trying to hold so many people and it starts to fall apart.  The pool is your server, the people are your users. The server can only handle so many requests at once, and that means if you have a huge number of people trying to access it, they have to wait longer and longer amounts of time.  Now, you can build an Olympic-sized pool in your yard, but it's super expensive and you may not have any friends that actually want to come over- it's almost impossible to know ahead of time. If you get caught up with a rush of people, you could always go out and buy another pool, but you have to wait for it to be installed, and you may have trouble with friends wanting to be in the same pool being split into different ones.  A scaling backend is more like putting up a buoy fence in a lake. If too many people show up, you can, on demand, push the buoys farther back into the lake or further down the shore (and hire more lifeguards part-time). When people leave, you can pull the buoys back. You only pay for the percentage of the lake you are using!  The Lake in this case would be a VPS, or a virtual private server. Essentially, lots of people share it, and if you have a rush of traffic, you can just make a request to increase the resources you have available to you on demand. Chances are not everyone on the shared server is getting flooded with traffic at the same time, so there's usually plenty of space to expand. If you run out, well, it's in a data center with hundreds of VPSes, so you can just jump to another one.  The trick is designing your app to be scale-able. It's way easier to inflate a pool in your yard initially than it is to coordinate a lake reservation and buoy fence system, but if you plan ahead, you can make sure you always have a refreshing place for your friends to swim.    Though, like my real life, my websites are never popular enough to have a too-many-friends problem... :("

From what I recall you are limited to the # of submissions and comments you can pull per API call.   Edit:  I'm a complete novice but I read through the reddit part of the source code and it looks like you are indeed just making API calls.  How do you get more than 100 submssions?

InternetIsBeautiful,3ap1bm,sirmarcus,183,Mon Jun 22 14:34:19 2015 UTC,It grabs the links for subreddits that you select and shows them in the music player. If you hit play or select a song it'll play that song inside the player.  I made it because I liked listening to music on Reddit and wanted a better interface for it. I just select subs I like and hit play and it'll keep playing for as long as I like.  You can pick any amount of subs you like and sort them similar to how Reddit does and it'll make a playlist out of that.

Android - you most likely will be able to get your app in but google will ban the app / account very soon. They are known for this.

One suggestion though, the main category subreddit listings appear a bit random, wouldn't it make more sense to put them in alphabetical order as default, and also maybe make them rearrangeable (drag+drop) by the user?   Also whatever filter is in place to filter out youtube links doesn't seem to work quite right, I get some self and imgur entries in the playlist."
InternetIsBeautiful,3ap1bm,Praises_GabeN,5,Tue Jun 23 04:51:33 2015 UTC,"There is no filter. You can click on self and imgur links and vote or comment. It just skips through them when you're playing. That way you get a feel of what the community's like.  The listings could use some work. I don't really like the categories I've placed them under and there are so many subs that it's hard to categorize them all.  I'm shuffling the list so each time you load you get a different set up top, but you can still search with the ""custom subreddit"" box to filter out the ones you want to add. It would seem unfair to me if anything starting with an A would go up top each time.  There was a good idea a while back to be able to favorite subs so you can pick from that, and it's in the issue tracker so it might be done eventually or by a contributor.  What do you think?"

InternetIsBeautiful,3ajy1j,nameisntname,18,Sun Jun 21 05:03:25 2015 UTC,"This website sucks on so many levels. It kills your browser by making every visitor solve an np hard problem via a brute force evolutionary algorithm when they could have just solved the problem once and then printed the finished map. It's also a problem that no one cares about. Finding the shortest distance from one place to another is obviously useful. Finding the shortest path through several restaurants is also useful to the handful people who deliver to those restaurants. But no one needs to know the shortest path through all the restaurants in Ann Arbor. And then, to make things even more absurdly inapplicable to any reasonable real world scenario, it calculates based on the straight line distance instead of the road distance. So if a internet surfing pigeon decides to idiotically waste a couple of days and a bunch of energy flying around to eat half a moldy sandwich (or the equivalent) from every restaurant dumpster in Ann Arbor, we've found what would be the perfect website for that comically impossibly specific situation, except that this website is designed so terribly that it doesn't even function as a reasonable solution to that problem.

The main improvements I would suggest is adding a button to go to the next generation (""Improve!"") instead of automatically running it forever, which kills your browser.  The straight line distance is a necessity to make it run as fast as it does, doing proper google map requests for each generation would take exponentially longer. I'm under the impression that you go to school in michigan which makes ann arbor a useful choice. It may look better if you changed it to airports around the world, where straight line distance is more reasonable without needing to really change the program's architecture.  You would probably also benefit from a DP solution where expensive calculations are done only once then cached for use later, instead of constantly recalculating them.  Ultimately though, this is NP hard and it will literally never stopin the average case as it is designed now."

You'll need to drag the files in the workflow window, select the action you want automator to perform and then just run the workflow. Make sure to duplicate the file you're editing because the process is irreversible."

InternetIsBeautiful,3afqw0,gatea,2,Sat Jun 20 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"""mplayer"" is  a command which launches the video player.  ""tv://"" is a parameter for the video player, we are telling them to open the tv:// (TV tuner ) device, but in Linux in can also means the webcam. Then, the mplayer displays what your webcam is pointing at, as in Skype.  ""-vo aa"" -vo allows you to change the video output device. For example, with ""-vo gl"" the video is played through your video card, so is accelerated and you CPU has to think less, then your computer has to do less work overall. ""aa"" is an AsciiArt output device, it means, render the video as a big picture made with letters."

InternetIsBeautiful,3aetmc,horticult,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:29:25 2015 UTC,"Utopia (UK TV series):       Utopia is a British thriller drama action television series that debuted on Channel 4 on 15 January 2013 and ended on 12 August 2014.   The show is written by Dennis Kelly and stars Fiona O'Shaughnessy, Adeel Akhtar, Paul Higgins, Nathan Stewart-Jarrett, Alexandra Roach, Oliver Woollford, and Neil Maskell.   A second six-part series of Utopia was commissioned by Channel 4 and went into production in late 2013.

InternetIsBeautiful,3aetmc,TheFeanor,2,Wed Jun 24 05:36:15 2015 UTC,how do you make one?
InternetIsBeautiful,3aetmc,Leathold,2,Wed Jun 24 05:02:06 2015 UTC,"It's much easier than you might think, though can be a bit daunting at first. The easiest way is to start at crossfade.io, it's a boring front page but think of it like a clean slate. Next you'll want to come up with at least 2 things you want to mash, the easiest being 1 video source and 1 audio source. So under the first bar let's paste a cool video like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axgDgH6f7Pw  Under ""Mode"" select VIDEO. This means that none of the audio will come through. AUDIO means audio track only, and A/V means that both will come through.   Next let's select an audio to play instead of the video sound. Something catchy like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afPLLWMLH6c and select ""AUDIO"" for mode.   Should look something like This by now.  Hit ""Save"". The page will refresh and start playing, however you'll probably notice things don't line up real well. Maybe an intro or title that messes it up, scroll down to ""START"" for the VIDEO track and enter a time that syncs better like say 47 (for seconds into the original track). Hit SAVE again. Now they should sync much better.   WAIT time is the time you're holding that track at ""0"" seconds, START is the time into the original track you want it to start at, and END is the time you want it to cut off. You might need to play with it to tweak to your liking.   If you want to make a clean start/end then assign an end time to both tracks (Try 218 on both tracks for the example you're making from my tutorial). Once you've saved that the URL ID is unique to you and you only, bookmark it and you can edit it any time with the same URL. If someone makes a change their URL will be different from yours so we can always find the originals.   Keep playing with it and you can move on to 3 track mashups like This or incredibly complex ones like This."

InternetIsBeautiful,3ackwy,Fred_Zeppelin,3,Fri Jun 19 14:25:03 2015 UTC,"Hello friend. (l work at loveland). We look at this as the base layer for what else you might want to do. So for example you can use our desktop surveyor which uses Streetview to answer questions on each parcel such as is it blighted, dumping, fire damage, lot or structure. And since your answers are attached to the legal description of the parcel and ownership info it more actionable then just an address.   So community groups trying to get grant money for boarding up homes, seeing over time how fast fire damaged buildings can effect properties around them. You can also survey on foot using our ios/android app. Etc.   Some places we have year built for entire cities (Miami is cool) which can give you a good idea of areas where lead paint might be a big issue.   soooo many options when this stuff is actually accessible and queryable."

Any number of real estate concerns can be derived from an assessor's property info, and maps like these are often the best way to find them. The size of the parcel, it's zoning classification, the land value according to the assessor, previous sale prices, improvements (like buildings) on the property (and their size, construction and tax value), whether a property is a single parcel or made up of several smaller ones, sometimes even water tables and soil information.  Some areas provide better online resources than others for finding this info through GIS or parcel maps."

InternetIsBeautiful,3ackwy,The_Sven,0,Fri Jun 19 04:26:50 2015 UTC,Florida is a great place to visit but if you live there you start to notice what a shitty place it is. The entire state is built on a swamp and the ocean is trying to slowly reclaim what is her's. That isn't a rising sea levels thing. Sinkholes have been a serious issue for years. The swamps are breeding grounds for bugs. The worst: mosquitoes and lovebugs.  You know what mosquitoes are so just imagine them in mass. Lovebugs are these little lightning bug things (minus the light) that mate by sticking their butts together and then try to fly. Except their butts are stuck together so they just hover. Swarms can get huge so that walking through a parking lot gets you covered in them.  But it's the heat and humidity that really made it awful for me. Heat index of 112 on a 90° day. And the sun going down doesn't help much. The humidity makes it so that it doesn't cool off very much.  I lived in Florida ten years and now in PA when everyone bemoans the winter and asks me why I left I just remember that the only Florida these people know is Miami Beach postcards.

InternetIsBeautiful,3ackwy,Ctrl--Alt--Del,2,Fri Jun 19 18:55:17 2015 UTC,"Florida is going to be hitting a similar point sometime in the future. Most of the water supply over here is in the form of limestone aquifers. The sand is like a giant filter, so the aquifers are receiving a lot of water. The problem is that the population is larger than what the water supply can support. When you pull too much water out of an aquifer, they collapse. Sinkholes are becoming a very serious issue over here. One could open up at any moment and completely destroy a house. Insurance companies do not cover sinkhole damages, either.    Californians worry about the state eventually separating from the rest of the country. Floridians worry about the state caving in on itself.    On a side note, I recall Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson discussing sustainable resources, and desalination came up as a topic."

For the most part we are actually cleaning up the data that your (all) local governments have. What you see now might not been 100% accurate but chances are it's in far better condition than when we got it. We're finding that many cities country wide are operating with outdated or just solidly wrong information.   Detroit is our most accurate since we've managed to combine over 20 datasets to filter out the noise and find errors. We continue to do this across the country where local govs are the most hands on and helpful.

InternetIsBeautiful,3ad23g,savanik,3,Fri Jun 19 11:50:12 2015 UTC,This is really cool.  Loved playing around with it can exploring the different features and layouts! I just kept hitting random and loved it.   My only complaint would be the most of the randomly generated maps end up appearing to look like volcanic islands in the 3D outlook. All the highest points are near the center and the gradient from the water to the highest point appears very very steep.  Other than that this is really cool!
InternetIsBeautiful,3ad23g,HistoricalNazi,6,Fri Jun 19 19:34:10 2015 UTC,"(Author here) Thanks! Yes, I the volcanic island design is intentional. These maps were made for a multiplayer game in which we wanted the players to start out by themselves at the beaches and work their way up the mountain, finding each other and joining into larger groups until they got to the top, where all the players would be in one large group, fighting the toughest monsters. Of course it didn't work out that way, but the maps were designed with that in mind.  If you look at the full article I have a list of other projects using these techniques, some of which may produce maps more to your liking. Also, the source code for this project is up on github. One day I'd like to make a much more flexible version of it, but I have so many ""one day"" projects :)"

InternetIsBeautiful,3abtqg,TheGeorge,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:31:12 2015 UTC,"Here's why that reasoning is ridiculous, in my opinion:  The reason that it is about race in this case is that there is still (statistics show it clearly) a endemic problem of racism and sexism in the American education system.  Black children are not gave the same opportunities to learn certain subjects because of racists (and often they don't even notice they're being so) in the system having bias towards white as wonderbread kids.  Young girls are not gave the same chance to learn technical subjects as young boys either, despite many wanting to.  Thus anti racism and anti sexism charities and grants have to be made to let them have the exact same chance in education."
InternetIsBeautiful,3abtqg,P12oof,1 point,Sun Jun 21 10:11:59 2015 UTC,"Still though, I don't think that charity should just focus on one color... Isn't that the same problem?

There are those charities too though. Why must it be either/or? Why not both? why not many?   There are too many problems in the world all of equal importance, best to try and hit them from many fronts.  I can say that it's not the old days anymore, IT is so ubiquitous that it must be taught early and taught well."

There is a problem with charity, all the problems charity attempts to solve are insurmountable. But if you break the problem into tiny pieces, it's just barely possible, though it will take a long time. Little by little, the world gets better.  The black girls coding is one tiny section of an unimaginably huge jigsaw which nobody knows the solution for, only that there is one and that there section seems to be sticking together."

InternetIsBeautiful,3a6yu4,yoodit2,2,Wed Jun 17 18:40:50 2015 UTC,"Right now I use pitchlab. I prefer pitchlab over any other tuner because it's so feature rich, but the thing that pushes it over the edge is it has a screen where you can see what note you play and what I can only describe as the pitch frequency. As you get close to the note it has a graph type image that goes from slanted to straight, it's easy to tell how close you are using this.  If I could add one thing to guitar tuners it would be auto tuning (like in rocksmith, where you strum a string and it shows you what string you're playing and what you need to do, as in ""tune up, tune down"". BUT this feature needs to have something where we can select different tunings too. There is absolutely no reason why guitar players who like to experiment have to open up chrome or another app just to get a different tuning, then go back to the tuner app."

InternetIsBeautiful,39y7zv,AMcewen84,17,Mon Jun 15 23:52:52 2015 UTC,Maybe I'm missing something. I've read these studies before and the data they use are from college graduates from 20-30 years ago. While it's fact for them is it a realistic forecast for more recent graduates in a market when it's less competitive to be a college graduate?
InternetIsBeautiful,39y7zv,Opiate_of_the_Massas,10,Mon Jun 15 21:54:30 2015 UTC,"The article he linked referenced a study of all citizens as of 2010.  Baby-boomers born in the WWII era were just beginning to retire when this study was done.    Also, an investment for which I pay nothing but still makes me money is always a better ROI than one which costs $30,000.  Sure the college grad may earn more than me but the ROI was less.  Basically the entire education/stock market comparison is pointless and does not relate to lifetime earning whatsoever."
InternetIsBeautiful,39y7zv,aronnax512,3,Mon Jun 15 23:10:44 2015 UTC,"The ROI on college is a very misleading figure. College attendance is an indicator for a plethora of characteristics that raise lifetime income regardless of college attendance.  To compound the problem of signal to noise, those that are sucessful without attending college are going to get averaged with those that fail to graduate high school.  College is valuable, but that value is routinely overstated."

Basically you would have to get everything VERY wrong before the numbers started to look like college was a bad investment.
InternetIsBeautiful,39y7zv,aronnax512,3,Tue Jun 16 00:18:32 2015 UTC,"What you'd have to do to get an accurate figure is control for the other variables that contribute strongly to higher income that get tangled up in the ""attend college"" figure. Affluent, socially connected, good primary education, self starting/disciplined, ability to focus, low probability of felonies on your record and a low probability of debilitating mental or physical disability all strongly correlate with college attendance. College doesn't create these characteristics, it's just that people with these characteristic frequently attend college.  The opposing average has problems as well. People that have success without college will have their income statistically buried by averaging them with homeless addicts, felons and those with illnesses so serious it prevents them from working much, if at all."

It just looks at how much in debt you are.  Someone who makes $100,000/year and just put 20% down on a $300,000 house would likely show up as a 0 because they have 20% equity in the house ($60000) but a debt of 240,000.

InternetIsBeautiful,39y7zv,usersingleton,27,Mon Jun 15 20:43:29 2015 UTC,I think you have to count the whole value of the house as an asset in that case. So they'd have $300k in assets and $240k in debt.

InternetIsBeautiful,39y7zv,zbufferz,14,Mon Jun 15 22:40:42 2015 UTC,"The idea of taxing wealth has been around for a long time, and is the centerpiece of Thomas Piketty's book Capital in the 21st Century that got a lot of attention last year.  Fun fact:  The Forbes 400, the 400 richest Americans (each with a net worth of at least $1B) have a total net worth of $2.3 trillion.  Tax their wealth at 1% and that's another $23 billion per year in revenue.  Just from taxing 400 people.  The point of the slider at the end is to show you that unless you are in that rare 1-5%, then taxes on wealth can't really affect you in any meaningful way based on how much wealth you have to have before you actually start pay more than you receive."
InternetIsBeautiful,39y7zv,bjarneh,4,Tue Jun 16 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"That's the idea; we have tried taxing wealth here in Norway, it's at 1% for everything over 1.000.000 NOK ~ 128.000 USD.  It's called formueskatt which directly translates to fortune (or wealth) tax.  Most countries have abolished that tax (here in Europe) since it leads to strange problems, how do you tax assets?, and what are they worth?  I.e. if all you own is the Mona Lisa painting, should you take out a loan each year to pay 10.000.000 to the state? Or should you cut off 1% of the actual painting as taxation?  These types of problems have lead to massive loop holes in the whole wealth tax, and many of the politicians who got this wealth tax passed (our previous prime minister Stoltenberg for instance), pay zero wealth tax, despite owning much much more than 128.000 USD.  I.e. they have created a tax that mostly stop companies from saving cash, it does not really affect the rich."

The thinking behind it is that we have an issue with wealth concentration, and without some mechanism to re-circulate that money our economy is going to stagnate and the rich are going to hive off from the rest of us.   There is a slider for tax exemption, which you can crank up to $1million (I assume this would cover your furniture).   I thought it was kind of interesting. I came in top 90 percent, and dialing in the maximum 'wealth tax' with a $25K exemption my annual bill would be about $6K/year. I'm not really happy about the idea of being taxed (again) on my house. But it would generate a massive amount of revenue from the top 1%, and if some of that income was used to lower tax on low and middle income earners, I'd support it."

To put a better perspective on where you should be by age look here or look at the US Census data directly.   For example, if you have more than $34k and you're under 35 you are in the 70th percentile for your age group, but only about 55% overall wealth. relatively speaking you are doing great, it's important to keep in mind the scale of things as well.

If you don't have a TV, live in a trailer park, drive a 17 year old car, have never been to college and are socking away every dime you make of your $20K/year job, you could be wealthy as fuck.  So many people confuse the two. Without wealth, when you're 72 years old, you will face real poverty. The trick is to live like you're poorer than you are. This builds wealth.

On that default track there's a set of places that are just eating my cars up.  One at 133m (steep hill, kills racers) and another just a little past it.   It's also neat watching designs that do well in one part be crushed in another.  Those ""wheel on every side"" designs work fantastically in bumpy parts since they can't roll over, but they hate inclines.  Meanwhile the long ones do better on inclines (since they won't tip as easy) but they're easy to catch on a hill.  I think I'm going to let it run for a few hours and see if anything can get past that death hill everything is getting stuck on.    Edit, apparently the default track is randomized... hmm...  Well I'm going to use world ""reddit"" and let it run a few hours.  edit2:  there's a hill at 152m on that track which might be a game breaker, letting it go for a while.    Edit3  few hours later I'm stuck at 165m with a car that is practically specially designed to get over that 152m hill.  Pretty sure this is where it ends."
InternetIsBeautiful,39ylnr,digital_end,5,Mon Jun 15 22:34:54 2015 UTC,"Ive been playing around with this too and I found one of the coolest things develop in one of my cars... I suppose it's developed the ability to right itself? It's essentially an equilateral triangle but one side has a sort of square protruding shape that has a medium density large wheel and a super high density medium sized wheel.  Whenever the car flips over onto this side, it starts rocking back and forth and makes slow progress along planar surfaces but the moment it goes over a bump the car completely tips onto another side and starts scooting along at top speed. The benefit of this square tumor is that it allows the car to essentially climb up slopes by rocking back and forth from sitting with the square against the slope and then falling onto the more dense wheel, pulling it up and then catching again. This process repeats and I've yet to see it get stuck on anything for more than 1 generation, it seems to be finding the optimal balance of weights and angle for the protruding surface.  Man this project is so neat."

InternetIsBeautiful,39u1h4,pantofla,31,Mon Jun 15 05:41:30 2015 UTC,How do they even calculate those gravity assists? Do all the planets have to be in perfect position? This is like pure magic to me.
InternetIsBeautiful,39u1h4,furryscrotum,35,Sun Jun 14 21:08:22 2015 UTC,"They calculate the gravity assists using Newtonian physics, same as Newton would've, except we use computers to speed up the calculations.  If you've ever played Kerbal Space Program, it's like that.  Some players have piloted some seriously impressive Grand Tours in that game that have a much larger number of gravity assists than what Rosetta did.  It should be pointed out that there's always some margin of error, and various tiny adjustment burns are needed along the way to make everything line up just perfectly.  I wish the graphic had shown those."
InternetIsBeautiful,39u1h4,CydeWeys,9,Sun Jun 14 21:27:00 2015 UTC,"Well in KSP I just put enough Delta-V on my ship so that it can get there without gravity assists.  When I get gravity assist windows it's amazing, but otherwise I don't care enough to calculate everything.  I've seen some pretty cool things done on the subreddit where people do their own calculations and exact burns down to the second.  It's pretty amazing what some kids with a game can do."
InternetIsBeautiful,39u1h4,IWannaFlyShit,14,Sun Jun 14 23:25:25 2015 UTC,"You can't put enough delta-v on your ship to accomplish many of the things that the people doing really complicated stuff with gravity assists to pull off Grand Tours are doing.  They're visiting every single body in the system (including all moons), with manned return landings, in a single initial launch and no inflight refueling.  If you didn't make use of gravity assists, because of the exponential nature of the rocket equation, you'd need an initial rocket much larger than your PC can support, with god knows how many tens of thousands of parts.  The game engine just can't handle that.  That's what I find so amazing about it all.  I imagine I'd find it tedious to pull off myself, and so I'll settle for watching others' hundreds of hours of effort distilled down to a YouTube video I can enjoy.  Like you, I'm content to build medium-sized rockets and do normal Hohmann transfers.  And I definitely don't try to visit multiple different planets in a single launch."
InternetIsBeautiful,39u1h4,CydeWeys,7,Mon Jun 15 00:39:32 2015 UTC,"The greatest thing I ever did was Jool to Moho to Eve to Duna to Kerbin.  I only landed on Gilly, Eve's moon, and was able to get orbit in each of those planets.  It was an immense ship and I had no preflight plans beside the transfer to Jool.  I applaud all the others who are able to do a grand tour, even landing on Eve and returning is insane."

The four separate optical telescopes are known as Antu, Kueyen, Melipal and Yepun, which are all words for astronomical objects in the Mapuche language.

Investment in research and such programs is not a waste of money. It creates the foundation for new jobs and industries.  The US claims it has lower unemployment, but the US has a lot of ""hidden"" unemployment and new-jobs-that-you-can't-live-off. That's even worse in my opinion."

InternetIsBeautiful,39n429,Mithrandork,9,Sat Jun 13 14:36:42 2015 UTC,"Names are just a horrible way to remember people. They're incredibly repetitive and I see them as very impersonal. It's a word that you didn't even get to pick, most of the time. By far, I consider my username more personal than my real name. At least I got to pick it. So yeah, I assume I'm not going to end up getting to know someone, so I don't learn their names on purpose. I stick to judging their character and personality along with how they look and how they present themselves. It's much more interesting than a name.  In fact, even my cat, Shadow, I never use her name. She's ""Baby Girl"" or ""beautiful"" or anything else. That's partly because she has a non-human name, though, but I prefer talking to her as a unique creature rather than a name. Even ""the cat"" has a more powerful meaning in my opinion."

I do occasionally see someone and think ""where do I know you from"" and then realise they served me in a supermarket before or something. I expect most people do the same."

The only thing I didn't like is the fact that you just have one angle and then you have to recognise them from a totally different angle you have never seen before.

InternetIsBeautiful,39n429,tropikomed,18,Sat Jun 13 09:55:51 2015 UTC,"At the University of Oregon, in the cognitive lab, I was part of a students research. Images of faces would flash insanely fast on a computer monitor. There was a camera pointed at my face and I had to click everytime I saw one of three faces that they had shown me beforehand.  The first round was slow. The second round was faster. The third round was barely a blip on the screen.  At the end of the study they explained what it was and how I did.  When we scan a crowd of people for someone familiar, our brains filter faces at such an incredible speed that they wanted to quantify the rate at which we can identify faces in a crowd.   The slow setting was usually really accurate. They said the more faces and the faster we scan, the filter in our brains is insanely accurate. I might miss a click, but my eye reaction signaled that a match was made.   I had never noticed how acute our visual and brain work together without us being conscious. When I did event security, I could assess a crowd in such fast scans and even more so if I was looking for something specific  (pot smokers, potential fights, someone getting ready to throw something, beer or liquor containers).   Going to the bars, I could scan super fast for people I was looking for.   tl;dr - crowd scanning for familiar faces is accurate. Brain filters quicker than we can consciously think."
InternetIsBeautiful,39n429,DeltaUltra,7,Sat Jun 13 06:50:54 2015 UTC,"There is a mental disability (sort of) called ""prosopagnosia"" (sp???????) which is the difficulty of recognizing human faces.  It varies all the way from 100% (very, very rare) to practically non existent.  Bluntly, humans have evolved such fantastic software for various things that we think they are simple, but in reality are some of the greatest challenges of AI (math ain't one of them)."
InternetIsBeautiful,39n429,davidsmith53,10,Sat Jun 13 08:20:01 2015 UTC,"My stepbrother has this. It's just a brain development mess up. He recognizes people by hair, voice, context, and body shape. But if I stood next to a girl who looks like me, he wouldn't know me. It's a total mindfuck. It doesn't actually bother him much because everyone he sees he usually meets in context (I only see my Mohawk friend at school, I only see blonde curly Angela at soccer practice, etc.) Or they are already talking when he sees them so he just uses voice. All it takes is a tiny bit more observation than usual to assure it is the correct identification."

It makes it hard to form friendships, cos we accidentally act colder to people whom we were cheerful and friendly with the day before.  It sometimes has extra stupid problems - not being able to recognise cars / your car, your house, topography (can't recognise streets), can't estimate ages/ race/ gender.  I have the car thing.  I use the beeper on my key to identify my car, or I read the licence plate.

That data can't be statistically negligible.

These events are generated when a client (who has Fortinet installed in this case) triggers an alert (and 99.99% of those alerts are false positives). In reality, the real cyber attacks of today (save for DDOS stuff) are either users who clicked a phishing email or plugged in an infected USB, which wouldn't show up on a map like this. The really dangerous cyber attacks, the ones people stay up at night worrying about, are silent, as no blinky box could protect from them."

This isn't to create classifications for broad areas-- you could just say NewYork.cake.basil if you wanted that.  This is so that people can say ""I'm at wasabi.fort.hello"" and someone can plug it in and know exactly where they are using this system. That way they won't be confused about anything, from street corners to which street they're on in cities with 1st st. north and 1st st south or things like that. It just allows you to reference a small point in the world uniquely."

But one of the ""3 words"" in the parking lot is ""veal.slowly.last"" ... there's a good chance I could remember that, and it'd be useful if I could easily use these 3 words as navigation points."
InternetIsBeautiful,396gkw,nevyn,9,Wed Jun 10 05:57:14 2015 UTC,"Plus a small error in coordinates could mean the location is off by a few hundred meters or so, not enough to make it clear there was a mistake. With this system, if you're copying it down, not only is it easier to spot a mistake (as it would mean a misspelt word and is unlikely to be valid), but a quick sanity check will usually let you know if there's a mistake if you know at least the general region. Of course if you have literally no idea about the region you could be off by thousands of miles, which is the trade-off."

InternetIsBeautiful,396gkw,tensegritydan,11,Tue Jun 9 19:49:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but the amount of precision needed to locate something or someone isn't that high, as long as you are withing maybe 3 squares (9m, about 27 ft) you should be able to find the house, or building."

InternetIsBeautiful,396gkw,tensegritydan,18,Tue Jun 9 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Having similar name next to each other and around each other could make for easy errors.   For example if you were looking to get to lemon.fridge.swing and whilst you were travelling you came to fridge.swing.lemon or lemon.fridge.swung you might think you arrived at the wrong place if you forgot the location due to a bombardment of similar places all around you. Kinda like when somebody tries to confuse you by randomly saying numbers out loud when you are trying to count things.  Amazon use a similar method in their distribution centres. They have completely no order to where things are stored (eg. a Dumbo DVD next to a packet of tennis balls next to a tub of hair gel), this is to reduce picking errors that are made when similar items are kept close together."

InternetIsBeautiful,396gkw,stopmotionmanager,13,Tue Jun 9 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"If you're trying to remember it mentally, yes maybe... but if you're relying on the app to store or remember or translate a location wouldn't it be easier to just tag a location in the app and communicate directly with other people?

I live in New York City, where there are FIVE streets called Broadway, and a few more that have a word in front of the word Broadway (e.g. East Broadway, West Broadway, Old Broadway, etc).   If I were to tell you I was at 1115 Broadway in New York City.  I could be at a building at the corner of Broadway and West 25th Street in Manhattan, on the Manhattan/Bronx/Westchester Broadway.    I could be at the corner of Broadway and DeKalb Avenue in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn, on the Brooklyn Broadway.  I could be at an apartment building in Long Island City, on the Long Island City-Elmhurst Broadway in Queens.  Two other Broadways would have to be ruled out. The Broadway in Staten Island doesn't go up to 1115, ending at approximately 715. Finally, there's the Broadway of Howard Beach. This one is ironic in a way, as it's the only one that's actually a dead-end street."

A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a logbook (with a pen or pencil). The geocacher enters the date they found it and signs it with their established code name. After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it. Larger containers such as plastic storage containers (Tupperware or similar) or ammunition boxes can also contain items for trading, usually toys or trinkets of little financial value, although sometimes they are sentimental.

It's a testing site ran by BlurBusters.com  They dedicated themselves to 'Everything Better than 60hz.'  As such, many of these tests are designed for 144hz monitors, ULMB monitors, GSync monitors, and so on.  There are tests to check for 'frame skipping' which happens when you try to overclock 3D TV's and such.  The forums and blurbusters.com are chock full of excellent if not very technical information.  If you are an FPS game who likes framerate and hates lag, you'll be right at home!  Or HMD's like the Vive or Oculus. Those use Low Persistence Displays to kill motion blur!

InternetIsBeautiful,3931ov,king_of_the_universe,10,Tue Jun 9 13:11:23 2015 UTC,"I'm the creator of TestUFO.   Haven't used reddit in months -- but, I'm the inventor of this animation, and the owner of Blur Busters.    Here's the Coles Notes 101: What is happening is a special temporal optical illusion is occuring, that is generated by motion blur caused by the action of your eye-tracking. Each refresh on most LCDs are displayed statically, one frame after the next, usually at 60 Hertz on most displays.  As you track your eyes on UFO #2, your eyes are in a different position at the end of a refresh cycle than the beginning of the refresh cycle.  The static frame is smeared/blurred across your eyes in the 1/60th of a second.  The horizontal spacing of the vertical lines is precisely the exact motion blurring distance, so when you track eyes, it fills up exactly to solidness.  In other words, the motion blur of your eye-tracking (UFO #2) horizontally blurs the vertical white lines, so that the blurring exactly fills the gaps between the white lines.  So it looks like a solid background instead.    This animation shows that this specific kind of motion blur is caused by your eye tracking, and not caused by the LCD itself.When CRT / LightBoost / ULMB (found in modern 120Hz gaming monitors), you don't see this optical illusion anymore because there is no motion blur, everything is crystal sharp like a CRT display.  This animation's purpose is to demonstrate that most motion blur on a modern LCD display is no longer caused by the display itself -- but by the action of eye movements themselves, because of the display high persistence (each frame being continually displayed for the whole duration of refresh, and the static frame being blurred on your retinas as you eye-track across the frame).  That's why strobe backlights in modern gaming LCD monitors, work to eliminate the remaining LCD motion blur.  Motion blur reducing strobe backlights go by various trade names such as ""LightBoost"", ""ULMB"", ""Benq Blur Reduction"", ""motion240"", and other brand names."

InternetIsBeautiful,3931ov,RealBillWatterson,1 point,Tue Jun 9 04:02:17 2015 UTC,lightboost is too bright?  lightboost dims your monitor significantly.  You likely didn't set it up correctly.  Its not really needed unless you are heavy into fast moving fps's.  Its marvelous for BF4.

InternetIsBeautiful,3931ov,gloryhit,1 point,Tue Jun 9 02:31:44 2015 UTC,What I don't understand is why the moving UFO looks blurry but the black squares are perfectly clear.
InternetIsBeautiful,3931ov,Arsenic_Waffles,2,Tue Jun 9 01:56:38 2015 UTC,"I'm the author of TestUFO.  First, read the ELI5 text at http://www.reddit.com/r/InternetIsBeautiful/comments/3931ov/fix_your_eyes_at_the_ufos_and_watch_the_magic/cs5l0ec   Next, the squares are very sharp because your LCD is extremely fast at pixel transitions.  The blur of the UFO is caused by the eye tracking (not the LCD limits), while the blur of the small black squares in background of UFO #2 is caused by the speed of LCD pixel transitions.  All this means is that most of the motion blur on your LCD is caused by the eyetracking, and not because of the limitations of your LCD.  If you want the moving UFO to be as crystal clear as the black squares, you need to use a strobe backlight (like those in a modern 120Hz gaming monitor)."

InternetIsBeautiful,3956rm,Birdman1096,1 point,Tue Jun 9 17:25:44 2015 UTC,I believe all planes at least in the US are required to have ADS-B tracking installed. These sites are fed mostly by users/airports so the chances are that some data may have been available from those missing flights but it wouldn't have been any better than what they already had unfortunately. Now say if there was a user out in the Indian ocean on a boat and he had an antenna and was picking up flight data he may have been able to track that flight but I don't believe there are many marine based ADS-B stations.   I Know this thread is a day old but if you have any other questions I'd be happy to answer them! I actually feed data to this site as well as flightaware using a home-made antenna and a 20 dollar USB dongle.

InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,Atmoscope,1 point,Mon Jun 8 05:27:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know about that. These agreements pretty clearly spell out your rights as a party to a contract. Among other things,they typically tend to limit their liability in the event their software crashes your system, require binding arbitration in a jurisdiction of their choice, and more or less allow them to do whatever they want with the data they generate. None of those are disclaimers, they're legitimately spelling out both your rights and responsibilities and theirs within the relationship formed by the agreement."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,HuldufolkAlfar,3,Mon Jun 8 07:38:52 2015 UTC,"DISCLAIMER - I am not a lawyer and this isn't legal advice. It depends, really - the claims don't always stand up when put to the test (in court), but unfortunately you can't just count on them being un-enforcable. Some types of claims are more bogus than others - for example, fine print that disclaims any responsibility for damage, especially real, physical damage, is generally complete crap (at least in Australia where I am). I'm sure someone more qualified than me can give more detailed examples, if you're interested."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,felixphew,6,Mon Jun 8 07:17:48 2015 UTC,"There are occasionally actual contracts in the US that attempt to protect one party from being sued for damages even if the claimed damages were proven to be the result of willful neglect.   The courts here laugh at those types of things.   Also there are loopholes like ""vague and unenforceable"" -- if a part of the agreement you agreed to contains language that no reasonable person could understand the court will toss that part of the agreement out. If there isn't a severability clause they may nullify the entire agreement."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,autowikibot,4,Mon Jun 8 05:12:21 2015 UTC,"Schrödinger's cat:       Schrödinger's cat is a thought experiment, sometimes described as a paradox, devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger in 1935.  It illustrates what he saw as the problem of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to everyday objects. The scenario presents a cat which may be simultaneously both alive and dead,        a state known as a quantum superposition, as a result of being linked to a random subatomic event that may or may not occur. The thought experiment is also often featured in theoretical discussions of the interpretations of quantum mechanics. Schrödinger coined the term Verschränkung (entanglement) in the course of developing the thought experiment.    Image i - Schrödinger's cat: a cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor detects radioactivity (i.e. a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison that kills the cat. The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics implies that after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality collapses into one possibility or the other.

InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,Skexer,4,Mon Jun 8 06:25:32 2015 UTC,"Steams TOS are especially interesting. A game you buy on steam is essentially just an ""indefinite"" subscription giving you access to the particular game. They may terminate your subscription at any time they wish to do so. Another interesting thing is that when you refund a game on steam (this is a relatively new feature)  the money is stored on your steam account and therefore remains in Valves hands. GabeN really did create a very powerful platform and we all love it."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,JakeTheMaster,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:56:27 2015 UTC,So the money can not be cash. You have to spend it on steam anyway?
InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,PresidentRex,3,Mon Jun 8 05:12:16 2015 UTC,"In the recent update, it claimed it tries to return to the source you used to make your payment (i.e. returned to your credit card). If that's not possible, it goes to your steam wallet.  I haven't actually tried for any refunds, so I can't verify that setup."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,Gnoem,5,Mon Jun 8 05:38:53 2015 UTC,"Well I can. I refunded 3 games, 2 went to my credit card, 1 to my Steam account, as I bought it using Steam funds. People make all these accusations about the refund feature, it's like they think its too good to be true. It works well, the process is easy to go through and it only takes a few days for your money to transfer to your steam/bank account"
InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,itonlygetsworse,1 point,Mon Jun 8 06:22:53 2015 UTC,"Right, I assume that's their loophole for banning accounts from Steam so they have the right to take away the products."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,DoverBoys,2,Mon Jun 8 06:40:57 2015 UTC,"Well, game terms are easy to enforce. They simply ban you and any legal action you take is thrown out because of their terms."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,Juking_is_rude,1 point,Mon Jun 8 07:49:37 2015 UTC,"Since it's assumed no one reads the ToS, consumer protection in the us says ""if it's something a reasonable person would agree to and can legally agree to, it's binding"" and otherwise you're fine. ultimately, that makes a judge and precident responsible for what really is legally binding if it comes up in court."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ypu2,maca77aq,1 point,Mon Jun 8 11:52:30 2015 UTC,"Hard to say. In part, it's because they typically either require arbitration, which prevents you from going to court or they make litigation incredibly difficult for you as a plaintiff.   However, the fact that you don't read it, at least for now, isn't a defense to the fact that you've accepted the terms. There is an argument to be made that the terms are cumbersome for lay people, are unintelligible, and are so long as to be practically worthless. This is why you're seeing a movement toward human readable agreements, which use plain language and imagery to show you what you're agreeing to. The issue here is that because they do not use specific legal terminology, they may not necessarily provide you or the company with predictable legal rights. Essentially, they create the argument that you agreed to the human readable terms, not the legal terms. But again, I don't think this has been litigated.   The issue with licensing is up for debate in the courts. There's a test, from a case whose name I forget, which essentially lists several factors. Those factors are used to determine whether there is a sale or a license. A lot of what is being done with these contracts is claiming a sale is a license, when it really has all of the features of a sale (single transaction, no ongoing relationship, etc). This is currently being worked out in the courts, and the next major frontline for this is the automakers claiming that we cannot modify our cars because we don't actually own the rights to the software in the car. I'd expect to see any eventual ruling touch on this issue.   As far as enforceability, generally, unless a particular term has been deemed invalid by multiple courts, I would treat it as though it is enforceable. I would not put any stock in any opinion that says they are merely advisory or that they are not contracts. Assume they are until it is proven they are not."

First, the image contains a nice mixture of detail, flat regions, shading, and texture that do a good job of testing various image processing algorithms. It is a good test image!

The fonts are weird sizes and hard to read, there's huge amounts of 'white' space wasted, much of it on swooshy filler graphics... control placement is neither intuitive nor efficient. The best thing I can say about it is that the black base and dim pastels don't tire the eyes rapidly.  I think a real, top-of-the-industry professional software engineer and graphic designer could maybe create a pleasant to work with graphical user interface that looks and feels like LCARS, but it would need entirely new interface mechanisms and visual elements invented for it that LCARS has never exhibited. Everything I've seen that attempts to simply slavishly copy the appearance of LCARS and then add functionality is clunky junk."

InternetIsBeautiful,38nt9m,jubjamie,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:58:14 2015 UTC,Is there a geological or technical reason why the tubes change elevation?
InternetIsBeautiful,38nt9m,mdedm,3,Fri Jun 5 15:10:56 2015 UTC,Pretty much because there is other stuff in the way. For example due to the position on Westminster Station the stations are stacked on top of each other so the trains change elevation there. But it could be as simple as some poor clay or rock in the way or it could be because older parts of the line were built closer to the ground. A number of reasons :)

InternetIsBeautiful,38nt9m,HeartyBeast,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:27:47 2015 UTC,"Over half of the underground is overground, and unsurprisingly the stuff underground tends to be in the centre, there's also a dirty great river running through it too.   Also the older lines tend to be shallower and the newer ones deeper.  The mainline stations seem to have deeper underground stations which make sense."

There are two types of line on the London Underground: services that run on the sub-surface network that is just below the surface and uses larger trains, or the deep-tube lines, that are for the most part self-contained and use smaller trains. Most of the lines emerge onto the surface outside the central area. The oldest train running on the Underground was introduced in 1972. The Underground is electrified using a four-rail system, the DC traction supply being independent of the running rails. Planned improvements include new stations, line extensions and more lines with automatic train operation (ATO).

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,random_us3rname,19,Wed Jun 3 15:09:31 2015 UTC,"It's a question of latency not bandwidth. Pretty much any amount of bandwidth over 1mbps will be enough to load the whole clip pretty instantly, it's your latency that matters.  If your internet is a pipe with water flowing through it, bandwidth is merely the size of the pipe, where latency is the speed the water is moving. More pipe matters if you're talking about a huge volume of water over a period of time (you can move 1000 gallons through a 2"" pipe faster than a 1"" pipe even if the water is flowing at the same rate in both) but if you just want a single droplet of water to move faster through your pipe, getting a wider pipe doesn't solve that, you need higher pressure.  Sadly, US ISPs don't seem to care much or advertise about their network latencies, and have convinced the public that bandwidth is the most important factor."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,lol_admins_are_dumb,25,Wed Jun 3 16:50:21 2015 UTC,"Latency is more like the length of the pipe.  When you're taking a shower and you adjust the temperature and it takes a second before you feel it, that's latency. It has to flush out all the cold water before the hot water can get to you.  Edit: I see what you're saying but usually when you say speed of flow people think bandwidth and they think that's something you can just turn up. Latency is limited by speed-of-light and the time it takes each network node to pass a packet along, and even cheap Internet plans usually have good latency."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,JaykoV,77,Wed Jun 3 11:39:17 2015 UTC,"I did my dissertation on this exact thing. I even used Suzanne Vega as one of the test stimuli on my subjects. Because the MP3 algorithm is so refined now, I don't think there are many people at all who can distinguish between 320kbps and lossless.  Actually, Suzanne Vega's song is now considered by the Fraunhofer Institute to be  a relatively good example of the MP3 algorithm's compression transaprency (compared to its earlier iterations).  Based on the controlled experiment I ran on around 30 people (including another set of people who studied music techonolgy/production at a degree level), I'd say 9/10 people who claim they can tell the difference between 320kbps MP3 and WAV/Flac are either lying or vastly overestimating their abilities."

So, guess that's consistent with the Vega consistently transferring to 320 well.  Honestly though, I was listening on really, really shitty monitor speakers.  The thing that gets me though is that for each and every track the higher pitched sounds sound more separated from the rest of them with all but hers.  There's just not enough musically going on in that track for me to pick it out as it's just her vocals on the test segment."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,bruce656,14,Wed Jun 3 18:21:18 2015 UTC,"who claim they can tell the difference between 320kbps MP3 and WAV/Flac are either lying or vastly overestimating their abilities.   Depends on type of music. Cymbal, triangle or xylophone heavy music? Even half deaf person can tell the difference."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,lua_setglobal,5,Wed Jun 3 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"Do you know anything about OPUS files? I have the Pink Floyd discog in OPUS format, and it sounds great, but that's the only time I've ever heard of it."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Xunderground,6,Wed Jun 3 18:35:46 2015 UTC,"Opus claims better quality per bit than MP3 or Vorbis (Vorbis claims better than MP3)  The cost is that the CPU usages to decode it is way higher. For desktop computers this isn't a big deal but it might be important on a phone.  ffmpeg supports Opus, so I've tried ripping a CD to it, but I can't tell the difference. I have crappy headphones anyway."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,huehuedownboats,3,Wed Jun 3 14:56:05 2015 UTC,"When I use lossy compression, Opus is my goto."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,poopbath,10,Wed Jun 3 17:25:57 2015 UTC,"In the old days I pretty exclusively downloaded lossless, but that was when CDs were still a thing.  I do agree that 320k is acceptable these days. The gap between it & lossless is much, much smaller than that between 128k & 320k.  Most of the time I'm not listening just to listen anyway, so it ends up making little difference since I'm preoccupied."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,WisdomOfTheFalcon,118,Wed Jun 3 17:02:22 2015 UTC,"For me the Jay-Z one was the easiest because I just went with the one where I could feel the sub bass that the other two cut out.  Coldplay one sounds like it was compressed all to hell before it was sampled for these audio files anyway, so it was the hardest to tell for me. I picked the 128 on that one, because it sounds like trash anyway (not the music itself, just the way it's recorded), and there wasn't much left for the compression to throw out.  I hadn't heard any of these songs before, but I think that if one is familiar with the songs, it's easier to tell which is which."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,cmaddog111,86,Wed Jun 3 14:36:53 2015 UTC,"With Coldplay, the 128 kbps is the only one that doesn't crackle when it starts clipping. So in a way, the lower bitrate helped alleviate the issues of the original master."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,prozacgod,37,Wed Jun 3 14:08:49 2015 UTC,I'm going to say that's why I picked 128 kbps.    OK? OK.

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,RusskiEnigma,3,Wed Jun 3 18:04:11 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I noticed this too and picked the 128 kbps one because I thought the crackle was caused by the lower quality files."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,jiteshkris,8,Wed Jun 3 14:54:33 2015 UTC,I got the Coldplay one because of a really subtle synth in the background that I only heard in the lossless one
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,OregonianInUtah,8,Wed Jun 3 15:03:33 2015 UTC,funnily with the M50x I picked 128 too.. I am disgusted with myself
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Honsou,3,Wed Jun 3 15:38:59 2015 UTC,You shouldn't be.  The 128 was the only one that didn't crackle.  The mp3 compression actually helped alleviate the crackling problem from the master recording.  It was a poor choice of track for hearing the difference between mp3 and wav unless they wanted an example of a time when mp3 actually sounds better.  I just got some M50x headphones a few weeks ago and have been loving them
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,bury_the_boy,15,Wed Jun 3 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"The Jay-Z one was hard for me, because you could tell the samples he was using for the drums were ""lo-fi"", so no amount of high bitrate could make it sound better."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Jimbo-Jones,14,Wed Jun 3 22:01:47 2015 UTC,"Hip hop is easy because higher quality always has better bass separation. I agree, I expected the Coldplay track to sound waaay better than it did – they tweaked that song too much in production."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,NeonFights,6,Wed Jun 3 15:19:26 2015 UTC,"That's what I've always noticed between 128k and 320k there is a massive difference in the low end. I can play the same song from my phone, then play it on pandora, and the pandora copy has no bass, and sounds like a pillow case is over the speakers in my car."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,SnarfleMonkey,6,Wed Jun 3 16:21:53 2015 UTC,That's why hip hop producers only make hip hop records and pop song producers keep making pop songs. They know what sound qualities and tones work best for their genre to fit all types of compression settings. The nuances are so slight that sometimes only the producer and artist can tell the difference.
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Sluisifer,14,Wed Jun 3 16:50:44 2015 UTC,"I got 5/6 right but I have good headphones. The WAV sounds more full, there is less background static and how the artists pronounces the ""s"" sound is more clear. It's such a tiny difference that I wouldn't pay for it though."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,ONLY_POST_DANK_MEMES,2,Wed Jun 3 15:35:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was surprised I could actually tell 4/6.  You really need to crank it up, though, to actually hear the difference."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,steamruler,4,Wed Jun 3 14:53:24 2015 UTC,"or so I pretend, at least.   The important thing is that you're aware of your audiophilic tendencies."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,bruce656,4,Wed Jun 3 15:40:30 2015 UTC,"I wish everyone just used V0 if anything, gives high quality but if it isn't needed, it ends up smaller anyways."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Ahab_Ali,2,Wed Jun 3 14:57:32 2015 UTC,"I was listening in on 2.1 speakers, so I could turn the sub off, and the difference in the tracks became more apparent. I felt a lot of the compression was covered up by deep-end base, especially on the Jay Z track."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,baconost,48,Wed Jun 3 14:40:26 2015 UTC,"Ditto. I had 3/6, but I had chosen the 320k MP3 on the ones that I missed. That makes it a flip-of-a-coin difference between wav and high-bit-rate mp3.  ETA: Or maybe this is just a stealth marketing gimmick showing us how bad 16-bit 44kHz wav files are, and that we really need to be listening to 24-bit 192kHz files offered by Pono, Tidal, and others. I mean, if you cannot even tell the difference between CD quality and 128k mp3, the CD quality must be pretty bad, right? ;)"
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,carpetedman,19,Wed Jun 3 14:55:10 2015 UTC,"But Tidal doesn't have 24/192, just uncompressed 16/44. Generally 16/44 is considered more than good enough as it covers the entire audible spectrum. 24/192 (Pono quality) is useful for audio engineers needing the extra headroom, but as a distribution format it is often considered to be snake oil. Some even claim it sounds worse as it introduces interference from outside the audible spectrum."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,darklin3,36,Wed Jun 3 13:10:51 2015 UTC,"The marketing gimmick is actually 24-bit 192kHz.  16-bit 44kHz is all you need ever.  If you have time and want to really understand why read this.    ELI5/TL;DR  16 vs. 24 bit  The number of bits is like clicks on your volume knob.  16 bit gives you 65536 clicks and no one can distinguish between click 40001 and 40002, so there is no advantage in adding more clicks on the knob (24 bit is 16 million clicks).  44 kHz vs 192 kHz  This sets the highest frequency that can be captured.  There's some moderately complex math behind this, but all you need to know is that the highest frequency you can detect and record is half this number.    44 kHz is a high enough rate to detect and accurately reproduce the highest frequency sounds that any human on the planet can hear.  Increasing this rate to 192 kHz allows you to record frequencies from 22 kHz to 96 kHz which are all undetectable to the human ear.  They also are not in the source recording (unless your band has a guy playing a dog whistle) and can't be reproduced by your speakers.  Marketers and even suckers customers will often try to justify these recordings as just ""feeling warmer"" or some such nonsense.  You might hear auidosnobsphiles say something like ""well I can hear the difference in my $20000 listening room"".  All of this is bullshit.  You wouldn't demand that your camera be able to capture ultraviolet light and you shouldn't want your mp3 to capture ultrasonic sounds."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,OneBigBug,19,Wed Jun 3 14:44:06 2015 UTC,"Actually not quite right. 16 bit equates to a a 96dB dynamic range. Humans can actually hear 120dB of dynamic range (this is up to the threshold of pain). So you can hear the noise level in a 16bit recording - but only if the music is very dynamic (so probably classical) and you are listening with a peak level of over 100dB. Which again is not particularly common, but plasible in some cases."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,sweetbacker,12,Wed Jun 3 15:08:59 2015 UTC,"For reference, 100dB is the loudness of standing right next to a jackhammer. 120 dB would likely result in instant hearing loss. 144 (the limit of 24 bit audio) would probably burst your ear drum. Anything over 80 risks damage to your hearing in the long term.  I'm not sure we particularly need the bit depth to allow for hooking up to a system such that it can produce a sound that kills. Maybe my ears are a bit sensitive, but I very rarely stand next to a jackhammer and go ""Hm, I really wish the music I listened to could be absolutely silent one moment and then this loud the next; it really would add to my enjoyment of the experience."""
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,carpetedman,12,Wed Jun 3 18:25:41 2015 UTC,"Actually, even the camera you have on your cellphone is probably able to capture ultraviolet light. It's almost certainly able to see infrared."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,DrunkInDrublic,8,Wed Jun 3 22:43:41 2015 UTC,Does that improve your photos?
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,carpetedman,5,Wed Jun 3 15:18:40 2015 UTC,They also are not in the source recording (unless your band has a guy playing a dog whistle) and can't be reproduced by your speakers.   One thing you might have gotten slightly wrong; the notes in the high ranges of many instruments contain overtones that we cannot hear. The band does not need to be playing a dog whistle to have the original source contain these type of sounds. I am unsure if these are picked up in the recording however.
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,DrunkInDrublic,4,Wed Jun 3 16:24:06 2015 UTC,"This is true, but think about what you are implying.  Would there be an advantage to a recording and playback process that allowed the capture and reproduction of inaudible sounds?  In practice, high frequency noise can only corrupt a recording by being aliased (folded) into the audible range.  This is something that a good sampling setup is designed to prevent.  You couldn't hear it originally.  You can't reproduce it with your speakers, and even if you could, you would not being able to hear it."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,aikl,3,Wed Jun 3 18:55:34 2015 UTC,"Generally I agree with you. I was not trying to imply that anything is lost by cutting this out. I was only pointing out that almost all original sources have overtones in this range.   I do think there is a very small chance that we can ""hear"" these sounds in the sense that they impact our subconscious interpretation of the richness of the harmony. Perhaps a FMRI would reveal that the brain does in fact react to sounds in this range, but for some reason this reaction is not perceived as sound input.  I also think there is a small chance that the inaudible overtones do effect the way we perceive the tamper of the note as a whole, even though we cannot independently hear the overtone when isolated.   However, those last two possibilities are speculative. I personally would never pay more for recordings with inaudible sounds."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,HiimCaysE,29,Wed Jun 3 19:06:28 2015 UTC,Part of it has to do with the equipment you are using to listen as well.
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Omnitographer,15,Wed Jun 3 19:15:53 2015 UTC,"Or even the listener. I'm young and my hearing is good/not ruined by too high volumes. I was able to get 6/6 with a PortaPro on one ear, plugged into a laptop. Some luck was probably involved, but I did try to listen to the track, although knowing what to listen for playa in as well.  Anyway, I'd rather spend money on good headphones than a lossless music service. I should probably repeat the test with something more suited for analytics."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,SparklingLimeade,14,Wed Jun 3 13:56:53 2015 UTC,"although knowing what to listen for plays in as well.   This is what I assume many will miss. 128k can be discerned by audio compression, but telling the difference between 320k and lossless is only going to be noticed in the S and T sounds in the vocals or other short-lived high frequency areas. Without excellent headphones or monitors and listening to them back and forth multiple times, they are practically identical.  If these samples were just a single tone at the top of your hearing range, it would be far easier to tell, but that's just annoying and hardly ever applies to music."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,KeavesSharpi,3,Wed Jun 3 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"Same here. I could tell which was 128 kpbs, but even with good speakers, a higher end audiophile 2496 sound card, and a decent amp, I couldn't tell the difference between uncompressed wav and 320 kpbs."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Stalked_Like_Corn,54,Wed Jun 3 17:29:37 2015 UTC,After hearing basically no difference in the first set from my speaker system I plugged in my nice headphones for the test. Buying these was the moment I stopped caring about the difference between 320 and uncompressed. They highlight terrible compression but good enough really is good enough.
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,rotzooi,15,Wed Jun 3 13:21:08 2015 UTC,"I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone over the age of say, 18, capable of hearing the difference between 320 and uncompressed to be honest. The frequency response of 320 is over 19k, which is right on the peak of adult hearing anyway."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,bobstay,8,Wed Jun 3 18:30:13 2015 UTC,"This is why when I compress, I usually do 192 ogg, which from the research I've done, is about equal to the 320 mp3."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,ItsLikeRay-ee-ain,9,Wed Jun 3 15:11:34 2015 UTC,"Yes. V0 is transparent to almost every ear.  And if you'd do a test like the one from this post with V4, V2 and WAV, I don't think many people would even spot the V4 easily.  And don't forget, most people don't listen to music under 'ideal' circumstances.  In your car or on headphones out and about on the street, you aren't going to hear the difference between >128kbps compression levels."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,KenuR,35,Wed Jun 3 14:33:28 2015 UTC,You're not supposed to be able to tell the difference between 320 and lossless.  Picking 128 on the other hand... I did that with Coldplay :P
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,pajam,39,Wed Jun 3 17:46:10 2015 UTC,"There's no denying the Coldplay 128 sounded better. I wonder what the sources were on that. The other two had very nasty distortion that I don't recall hearing on the CD before, and I listened to that track extensively.   EDIT: Hmm. On prompting from /u/ohgross, I checked the full track from another source. Clipping's there, brought in at the mix or mastering process. It just becomes less noticeable with the lower bitrates as 128kbps MP3 typically ditches anything above 16kHz - i.e. the frequencies where digital clips are loudest."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,gayinhellkid,17,Wed Jun 3 14:41:32 2015 UTC,This! oh god this!  128kbps was the only one not crackling like mad!
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Guinness2702,4,Wed Jun 3 14:56:55 2015 UTC,Even if you don't crackling into the account the 128kbps version sounded kinda muffled to me compared to the other ones.
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,bobstay,3,Wed Jun 3 16:47:31 2015 UTC,"The crackling/popping occasionally threw me off. The moment I would hear it in one, I discounted it. And at least twice that one was the wav."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,bobstay,6,Wed Jun 3 21:06:20 2015 UTC,Yeah for fuck sake the 128kbs was the only one without the distortion in the background.

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,treycook,28,Wed Jun 3 17:14:01 2015 UTC,I don't think so. I rather think that the order is random. If you refresh the page they are in a different order every time
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Send_me_Pics_,6,Wed Jun 3 12:56:13 2015 UTC,"So it does. In which case, maybe I stopped concentrating..."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,theboatleft,19,Wed Jun 3 12:57:48 2015 UTC,"Thing is, there are definitely tracks where I can hear the compression at 128kbit. Just not all of them. I can especially hear it with cymbals."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Ronyx69,3,Wed Jun 3 12:59:56 2015 UTC,Yeah drum sounds almost always give it away. Without that its a bit harder to tell.
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Pluckerpluck,3,Wed Jun 3 13:00:54 2015 UTC,"Also depends on the mix. Soundcloud streams at 128 kbps. Almost everything sounds just fine on both my speaker and headphone setups, but there are a few tracks where their compression squashed just the wrong frequency range and makes everything sound super harsh (as you mentioned, cymbals and snare fuzz run along this freq. range). I've downloaded the tracks elsewhere and they sound fine.  There are a plethora of variables and potential bottlenecks to sound quality:   The Track (Performance, Engineering, Mixing, Mastering) Bitrate (Compression) Bitrate again (Re-compression for online and streaming services) Software (Driver) Hardware (Decoder, Amplifier, Speakers, Headphones -- all of which have many components themselves. Motherboard issues can cause interference if you don't have an external sound card.) Acoustics (Room Shape, Room Size, Sound Deadening, Noise Reduction) Biological hardware (Your ears. How well did you protect them for all those years at shows?) Listener experience (Trained ears. A professional can pick up on subtle differences that a casual listener cannot. It takes a lot of practice and contextual knowledge. I'll admit that my ears are not the most trained.)   If there is a fault anywhere along the line, it bottlenecks the rest of the line. Worse, if there are multiple faults, the quality can degrade.  As for me, when done properly, it's actually pretty hard to tell the difference between 128 kbps and 320 kbps. Anybody can tell the difference between a crappy 128 kbps comp and FLAC, which is as noticeable as going from 96 to 128. In compressing, you do lose a lot of information, by definition. But if you engineer with this in mind, you can make it hardly noticeable at most listening levels. I'll still always go with 320 kbps in my collection to minimize instances in which the artifacting is noticeable. But beyond that, in my opinion, you're mostly stroking your ego if you need FLAC for listening. Obviously, you want the uncompressed WAV or FLAC if your intent is editing, mixing or re-compressing the track. But for listening? It's the wine-taster's phenomenon, in my book."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,Kerfulfel,3,Wed Jun 3 14:36:39 2015 UTC,I got 2/6 but for the 4 I got wrong I picked the high quality MP3.

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,heavymetaljess,142,Wed Jun 3 17:22:56 2015 UTC,"Am i really the only one who noticed how distorted the coldplay track was on the higher qualities? The lowest quality has almost no distortion while the higher ones, especially the lossless wave is noticeably distorted.  Also half of these tracks just don't sound like they are very well mixed/mastered (loudness war victims) and don't contain a lot of highs, where the compression artifacts are usually the most prominent.  The only track where I could actually hear the compression was the orchestral piece, the white noise loses some high frequencies there.  A better test would be one where the listener could switch between the versions while listening, not stopping the track and starting it again."
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,boredinballard,31,Wed Jun 3 18:30:08 2015 UTC,"I did as well. Those crackles were probably just removed in the lower quality due to their frequency.  I just tested on Google All Access (uses 320kbps I think) and the crackling is there too.  I can't easily get a FLAC/WAV copy from a torrent because I'm at uni right now (plus, I'm not currently a member of any of the decent trackers for music, so wouldn't be able to vouch for quality). If you can grab a copy it might be interesting to test."

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,xfloggingkylex,10,Wed Jun 3 14:42:57 2015 UTC,The Coldplay one sounded so muddy on the highest quality. I really didn't like it at all and also chose the lowest quality.
InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,m1ss1ontomars2k4,5,Wed Jun 3 15:25:27 2015 UTC,I did that exact same thing. It's because the mastering is crap and it was a bad choice for this sort of listening test. The song has no dynamics.

InternetIsBeautiful,38ct0r,NotDaPolice,79,Wed Jun 3 18:01:09 2015 UTC,Most people seem to agree that 320 and uncompressed (lossless) are basically indistinguishable.

And if you're using a sound system that has more than stereo, MP3 is usually stereo only and FLAC is multi channel.

But that spectrum doesn't translate to source material nearly as well. With digital you hit a threshold pretty quick. For me any MP3 at or above 256 is indistinguishable from uncompressed. Vinyl does have it's own sound. I like it. I don't have a turntable though.

While the coldplay track is clipping the entire time. No I can't tell low bit rate white noise from uncompressed white noise.   I think the most I'd say as an audiophile is that the biggest gains are in your speakers (or in my case headphones). The next biggest gain is the DAC/amplifier. After that you're in the world of woo , bullshit, and getting swindled. Better cables will not help you. Flac isn't noticeably different than 320kbps, and don't empty your bank account because your ears like something."

I had to listen to each question many times, and my choices never felt 100% certain.  I am a musician not an audiophile, so I treated this as a listening exercise. Hearing these usually-ignored details in the sound was quite a challenge. Question one was basically a guess for me, but by question six I had mostly figured out what to listen for.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but I guess the uncompressed audio sounds more ""continuous."" I can hear this best in the decay of longer sounds, and in the reverb. For example, in the mozart sample, the difference becomes most clear during the descending piano run.  Still, I have a hard time concretely hearing the difference, and often it is my intuition that tells me which one. Like looking into a very dark room, focusing on details your eyes can see nothing, but looking generally at the whole room all at once you sense vaguely where the large furniture pieces are."

Could you find a $30 bottle I hate and convince me that it's something much cheaper, or a $10 bottle I like and convince me it's much more expensive?  Probably.  But I'm more likely to find the $30 bottle better tasting than the $10 bottle.  It's like talking about expensive food.  Is it really worth $60 or more for a single entree at some restaurants?  Who knows.  Just because it is expensive food doesn't mean I will enjoy it, and just because I'm eating $5 chik-fil-a nuggets doesn't mean I won't enjoy that (I love chik-fil-a).

Putting it this way either tests whether you think uncompressed sounds 'better', by appealing to your taste, or testing to see if, once you see two sounds are different, you can tell which of them is a distortion of the other.

For the latest news on when NotFound.org will be available in your country, please follow us on twitter.com/notfoundorg     Why do I sometimes see older persons in the missing children application? These are what we refer to as 'cold cases', that is to say children who have been missing for years. With aging software, we try to give an impression of how the person would look like now.  My country is not listed. Does it make sense to install Notfound on my website? If your country is not listed NotFound.org will show missing children from other countries on your 404 pages.

InternetIsBeautiful,38dm08,Nightgloom,2,Wed Jun 3 21:56:07 2015 UTC,"I don't like how the paragraph next to each image implies that the missing person can simply call if they need help. It just makes me a little annoyed because I doubt the majority of the missing people are able to call. I think the site should imply they are victims/survivors, NOT runaways who can call ""to be helped with whatever they are going through."""
InternetIsBeautiful,38dm08,Nightgloom,3,Wed Jun 3 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"I agree that it is badly phrased. Granted, a lot of victims are technically able to call or escape at several points, but still can't due to shame and fear.   Maybe ""If you have seen this person, call us. And if you are this person, contact us. We do not judge, we are here to help."" or something along those lines would been better?  Yet, the base idea of spreading pictures of missing children around like this is quite interesting. A modern milk carton you might say."

InternetIsBeautiful,382l93,pteaster3,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:10:17 2015 UTC,Too bad actually doing something like this would be stupid expensive.  308 1x2 black bricks cost around $42. Just to put it into perspective.
InternetIsBeautiful,382l93,Zylinbia_the_Seeker,1 point,Tue Jun 2 02:13:56 2015 UTC,You use 1x1 bricks for pixel art and 42$ isnt bad for a cool piece of art
InternetIsBeautiful,382l93,zombdi,1 point,Tue Jun 2 06:24:08 2015 UTC,"What do you mean? You use more than 1x1 bricks. And It's not $42 for the whole thing, that $42 is just going for that one set of 1x2 black bricks. That's not even counting the other bricks. An actual lego mural would cost a few hundred."
InternetIsBeautiful,382l93,DoctorBallsack,1 point,Tue Jun 2 07:05:34 2015 UTC,Sorry my bad I didn't see that before wrting the comment but 1x1 bricks or 2x2 bricks would be more common for pixel art

See who you are following: This is used  to help users find other people who they already follow on twitter. i.e. This will show you a list of everyone you follow on twitter who also has a wedrawcomics account.

InternetIsBeautiful,37xxju,UltraChilly,18,Sun May 31 13:04:29 2015 UTC,There's a brilliant written guide built into the software - just click the help button!
InternetIsBeautiful,37xxju,UltraChilly,9,Sun May 31 13:17:21 2015 UTC,"Ah computer music. When I was still in school my final project was building a version of PureData that kids ages K-12 could use to learn the basics of object oriented programming by building synths in PD and connecting to them with WiiMotes via bluetooth. They could ""play"" their synths by programming the individual components of the instruments to accept data from the WiiMote's accelerometer (side to side speed controls dynamics, a jolt up or down changes the note, hitting the A button swaps instruments, stuff like that).   This seems like it would be a good ""next step"" for that, because PD is primarily visual, and this would take them into actual text based coding (you can do that in PD already when you're actually creating the bare bones objects, but it can be a little intimidating to start).  Neat stuff! When it comes to what Sonic Pi can do, how does it rival the capabilities of MaxMSP or PureData? Does it have any noticeable limitations, or is it pretty much a ""You can do whatever you can think of"" type of software?"
InternetIsBeautiful,37xxju,Xuuxij,4,Sun May 31 16:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it matches the capabilities of MaxMSP, yet.  But it offers a great simple environments for people trying computer music for the first time.    I'm a musician first, techie second and was really baffled by Max.  This I was up and running in seconds."
InternetIsBeautiful,37xxju,stovenn,2,Sun May 31 16:51:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah that makes sense, it took a good 5 or 6 months for me to start feeling comfortable with Max, and then another year and a half of really digging into it and PD for that research project to realize how powerful it actually was. It's not exactly an easy learning curve - our computer music class (basically just a composition course using nothing but Max) started out with 15-20 people and finished with 6."

I have  seen the Sonic Pi IDE evolved quite nicely making it even better as a programming teaching tool. there seems to be a lot of teaching material for using it as introduction to programming   http://www.sonicpiliveandcoding.com/ http://sonic-pi.net/  The RPI sound out the mini jack is quite poor. I have heard that you can get better sound it you get the sound thought the HDMI. Is this correct?   Also there are a lot of ""hats"" (boards that fit over the RPi) the make it output better sound. Would they work with Sonic Pi?"
InternetIsBeautiful,37xxju,KloudRazor,2,Sun May 31 18:15:42 2015 UTC,Yes - Sonic Pi uses Ruby.   To be honest - I haven't actually tried Sonic Pi on the Raspberry Pi.  Sam Aaron (twitter.com/samaaron) Sonic Pi's creator might know more about using it on RPi.

Is this correct?   Yes, the audio from the 3.5mm jack is crap because it doesn't have use a DAC to produce sound, it uses a crude PWM signal created by the DMA controller on the Pi. Whereas the HDMI jack sends a digital PCM signal which can be decoded by an external DAC."

InternetIsBeautiful,37uak9,6022e20,11,Sat May 30 19:24:12 2015 UTC,"One reason would be that free certificates aren't available for corporations:   In the Class 1 settings (free), the only possible relationship between StartCom and the subscriber is with individuals, i.e. natural persons. StartCom has no relationship with the organization a subscriber may represents and acknowledges only the subscriber. All responsibilities according to the StartCom CA Policy are that of the subscriber personally, even in case he/she decides to obtain certification as an employee or representative of an organization."
InternetIsBeautiful,37uak9,Phantom_Shadow,7,Sat May 30 19:30:32 2015 UTC,"Different levels of certificate. Startsll isn't as well recognized as larger companies that provide ssl certificates so occasionally a browser might not recognize it and give a warning, but it gets the job done for a small personal website.  The ones you can buy from startsll as well as elsewhere will have identity checks etc and you can get features such as a green box with your company name in the url bar which makes it more obvious to customers.  If you're a company using the website to sell services you'll want to make sure every browser will accept your certificate, and make it clear to the user that the page is secure, belongs to your company etc. Basic certificates provide encryption, expensive certificates provide both encryption and assurance over who is running the website."

InternetIsBeautiful,37uak9,bigdon199,6,Sat May 30 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, nice concept!  Quick tips:  Some browsers will not allow you to have secure HTTPS. This is because in your source, you wrote  <link href='http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto' rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'>. Remove the http: and just make it ""//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto"", since it should automatically route you to the https version. You could do the same thing for the other ones that you have https:// in front and change it to just // since it should automatically route it to https, but that's up to you.  Otherwise, great job!

InternetIsBeautiful,37qilz,GAMEchief,18,Fri May 29 20:47:07 2015 UTC,"TL;DR:  Type in ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ for proper formatting  Actual reply:  For the   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯    like you were trying for you need three backslashes, so it should look like this when you type it out  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯    which will turn out like this  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   The reason for this is that the underscore character (this one _ ) is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does (this guy * ).  Since the ""face"" of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the ""face"" (this guy (ツ) ).  The backslash is reddit's escape character (basically a character used to say that you don't want to use a special character in order to format, but rather you just want it to display).  So your first ""\_"" is just saying ""hey, I don't want to italicize (ツ)"" so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since it's just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm, so you have to add two more backslashes (two, not one, since backslash is an escape character, so you need an escape character for your escape character to display--confusing, I know).  Anyways, I guess that's my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol  CAUTION: Probably very boring edit as to why you don't need to escape the second underscore, read only if you're super bored or need to fall asleep.  Edit: The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore (which doesn't have an escape character) doesn't have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddit's formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text, then you put the text you want to format, then you put the character again.  For example, you would type _italicize_ or *italicize* in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have \_italicize_ and don't need to escape the second underscore since there's not another non-escaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ but you don't need to since there's not a second non-escaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line (but not if you used a line break, aka pressed enter twice).  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the non-escaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this, you can type _italicize* and it should not be italicized."

The judge asked me two yes/no question, stamped my docket and sent me on my way with the mitigations I'd requested.

InternetIsBeautiful,37gt5d,Yodaddysbelt,46,Thu May 28 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"Here's what the paper says about programmers.   challenging or critical applications, as in ICUs, algorithmic recommendations may serve as inputs to human operators; in other circumstances, algorithms will themselves be responsible for appropriate decision-making. In the financial sector, such automated decision-making has played a role for quite some time. AI algorithms are able to process a greater number of financial announcements, press releases, and other information than any human trader, and then act faster upon them (Mims, 2010). Services like Future Advisor similarly use AI to offer personalised financial advice at larger scale and lower cost. Even the work of software engineers may soon largely be computerisable. For example, advances in ML allow a programmer to leave complex parameter and design choices to be appropriately optimised by an algorithm (Hoos, 2012). Algorithms can further automatically detect bugs in software (Hangal and Lam, 2002; Livshits and Zimmermann, 2005; Kim, et al., 2008), with a reliability that humans are unlikely to match. Big databases of code also offer the eventual prospect of algorithms that learn how to write programs to satisfy specifications provided by a human. Such an approach is likely to eventually improve upon human programmers, in the same way that human-written compilers eventually proved inferior to automatically optimised compilers. An algorithm can better keep the whole of a program in working memory, and is not constrained to human-intelligible code, allowing for holistic solutions that might never occur to a human. Such algorithmic improvements over human judgement are likely to become increasingly common.   tl:dr: compilers are so good that programmers don't need to exist.   It doesn't take into account the fact that just about all of the automation of all of the other jobs will be done by programmers. Also doesn't give any reasoning for Programming and Software engineering being 2 different jobs, or why they're so different in % chance of happening."

Your face is essentially a unique piece of art upon which the clothing can be placed.   Secondly, advertising laws mean that the real product (ie physical clothing items) have to be showcased in advertising in many countries, meaning that CGI models aren't an option."

Before you all go thinking that IKEA has got better artists than ILM or WETA, just remember that it is very different creating a still image compared to a whole sequence. You can afford some really time consuming renders because you only do one render instead of 24.. For every second of footage. Not to mention that the post-render touch up in Photoshop is less limiting than what you can do with a sequence in Nuke.   Also that article pisses me off because they don't know the difference between special effects and visual effects...   Edit: just saw you specifically mentioning pictures. Not sure what you have seen before but there are a lot of great renders on par or better than this. Also furniture or room CG is very rewarding and easy to make realistic compared to stuff like characters."

InternetIsBeautiful,37gt5d,Delphizer,10,Wed May 27 19:02:54 2015 UTC,"What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.  Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.  There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!"

Judges are public officials, as much as politicians or the Executive.   I suppose I have appellate judges in mind more than trial ones, but tricky issues can come up at trial too.

InternetIsBeautiful,37gt5d,WittyOriginalName,31,Wed May 27 17:03:18 2015 UTC,Look up servers- they will be automated as well according to this.  So the robot cook will totally hit on the robot server.

InternetIsBeautiful,37gt5d,pk_6,18,Wed May 27 16:10:36 2015 UTC,"Well the robots won't taste it, the robot technician will taste it, now the robot makes it that exact way each time. Now corporate is ensured that their recipe is being followed to a tee. Instead of you shaking that seasoning one more time or one less time the robot always does it X amount of times.  When I was a cook in a family owned place, the owner always talked about how we needed consistency between cooks. People would order differently if they knew who was in the back. That won't be the case with Mr. Roboto. He doesn't get lazy, he doesn't forget he dropped fries, he doesn't get impatient and flip the burger too many times.  You're probably a great cook, don't get me wrong, but the Robot would probably make a much more consistent cook than most.  It also probably won't be a robot in the sense of C3PO wearing a chef hat and holding a spatula. It'll be like those automated soda machines you see at McDonalds or the French Fry vending machines in airports. Just a big machine or a series of them that spits out food.  PS: in my Restaurant there was a whole week we weren't allowed to talk to the Waitresses about anything but work because we'd all be teasing each other in the kitchen all night with our man humor. In would walk a waitress who we'd just want to include in our fun and she'd run out crying. So the harassing the waitresses thing... My best guess is they'd have to keep one of you on staff just to do that."

So they take their data from the dozen or so websites that offer this information, put it in a better format and make those websites utterly redundant.  Personally I'm okay with it, but I could see why it might piss off some websites - especially those that grew their food databases with years of user addition and admin review (say like myfitnesspal - which offers a lot more than just dietary information anyway)."
