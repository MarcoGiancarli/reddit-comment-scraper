But to sum it up,  sometimes  during tournaments players will  qeue for pub  games  to  warm up or something. Envy, in blue, who is very serious at this point about his player ranking, left his computer and H4nni, at the desk, changed his settings  for south east asian servers.  These servers are notorious  in the  dota community for being especially  shitty for non-sea people  and having terrible  ping  for players outside of the region. This functionally doomed envy to lose player rating. He decided to dump water on H4nnis head during a casting desk interview. When this happened, lots of people thought  it was actual monster drink he poured, but it was just a prop sponsor can filled with  water. Shortly after, each of these playerss' pr reps claimed it to be staged and the discussions pretty much ended without a resolution. Envy is known for having a.. er.. passionate  mentality about  gaming."

Hanni pretty much says once you get to 6k it's whatever at that point, EE says it's hard and he's determined to get to 7k and beyond. So EE starts his queue as we're watching tinker game, he steps out for two minutes. During that time Hanni, knowing how important solo queue is to EE, switches the region to SEA which would result in roughly a 400 ping. Eventually EE returns, Hanni steps out and his queue pops, at which point Hanni returns as EE is picking his hero and starts laughing repeatedly. Shortly after Hanni leaves to go cast Tinker vs VP. During the cast Hanni references this SEA queue prank a couple times, needless to say EE hears about them, adding fuel to the fire. It's at this point EE get's the idea in his head to prank Hanni by dumping a Monster Energy Drink on Hanni during a live cast."

Really his other option is just sit there and take it when he's getting silenced, attacked and subject switched so fast.  I really can't tell what they're trying to achieve.

When Ali says he was lead on, he isnt joking. He knew from the start he liked this girl. So as a normal human being he told her ""I like you"" and asked her ""Do you like me?"". To that she responded yes. She confirms this herself in the video, although afterwards she says how that means nothing (great logic). Now thinking they are in the early stages of a relationship, Ali gets involved. She starts ignoring him. He gets hurt ( that is just how he is as a person, very passionate and emotional). He posts a video on Facebook telling his followers how he is feeling, never mentioning this girl or even hinting at anything specific. She thinks that this is somehow a personal attack on her and proceeds to flame Ali on her stream, hard. Ali realises that things are going to shit and makes a second video, apologising for the first one. He literally screams sorry and that he messed up.  But since she never cared about him and just lied to his face, she ignores the video and then this happens^ The reason he got so mad is exactly that, he did nothing wrong, and yet he is being called a narcissist by the biggest douchebag the world has ever known.( that and he has trouble holding back his emotions, that is just how he is and why his viewers love him) TL;DR: A lot of you are twats (but a lot of you are funny as hell xD)"

He just explains how he has a hard time at the start of a relationship because he hates that uncertain feeling from not knowing where he stands with the person.   She had been acting distant toward him (after apparently previously having shown some interest) so he became suspicious that she was just using him to boost herself on twitch and generally leading him on. He wanted to confirm their relationship and step it up but she dodged around it without giving him a definitive answer and seemingly avoided it (likely because she really was leading him on to boost her twitch career).  If that is true he does have a right to be upset with how this went down and how she used him.

Then he acts like he's all righteous and being fair.  The best thing for Gross to do was to just end the call and ignore Rainbow & Platypus and continue his life. However, I don't blame him for trying to defend himself... After all, he probably does care for Rainbows and that's why he just doesn't wanna end it like that (specially since she obviously has some fucked up people around her)."

After 20-30 minutes I would pile him into the ground like a fucking tent peg man.

LivestreamFails,3c955k,Opisnotwatuthink,-6,Tue Jul 7 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"No they didn't. They didn't at all, because whether you accept it or not, the meaning of the emote Kappa has lost its meaning over the last few years, and now that you guys think you're the smart-asses trolling people by ""pretending"" you're retarded, you're actually being retarded and promoting retardation.  Which ends up in that video. People who ""pretend to be retarded"" but actually are. This should represent around 90% of the Kappa spammers that there is on Twitch, as about 1 out of 10 people use it correctly."
LivestreamFails,3c955k,UndersizedAlpaca,6,Tue Jul 14 00:57:43 2015 UTC,"You need to take a step back and think about how worked up you're getting over the colloquial meaning of an internet emote how to ""use it correctly.""   Spamming and trying to incite spam is obnoxious and it's normal to be annoyed by it, but if thinking about how people use a glorified smiley face in internet chat rooms makes your blood pressure rise then you're taking this stuff too seriously."
LivestreamFails,3c955k,Opisnotwatuthink,-7,Tue Jul 14 01:18:29 2015 UTC,"I'd be curious to know how you can possibly tell about my blood pressure rising after seeing people spam an emote.  Fighting retardation has always been on my top priority list, and it's becoming quite big with the Twitch chat phenomenon, so I will simply keep on stating the truth so that people realize what they're doing.  A videogame chat itself, or an emote shouldn't be taken seriously. However the proportions and the direction this is taking is not to be underestimated, and I think I'm granting it as much importance as it requires."

One thing we can both(hopefully) agree on is that at least she tried to get the kid to do something else, took a momentary interest in what he did and even asked if he wanted to watch a movie with her!

But she doesn't know why and how she should be concerned at the symptoms, so the solutions are awful.   I'm at an [5] right now so I'll just jump into her shoes with the knowledge. If his eyes water often the screen and room lighting need to change for the heavy usage. I don't want my son streaming if he's gonna die early in the round like he did..regardless of distraction. Step-your-game-up. Damn right I'm gonna kiss you when you're shitstreaming in the middle of the day. CS:GO not all the time...its not for you. No more COD sequals unless co-op campaign...but yeah go play MineCraft, Mario, Smash Bros. a sports game. I would much much prefer my child playing CS online than Candy Crush on iPad, but I digress.

It wasn't even a chore or something she asked him to do, it was stop what you're doing and come watch a movie.

The mother is not being unreasonable and in fact I feel shes a good mother for trying to limit the amount of time her kid plays on a violent game at such a young age.   It seems shes ok with him playing games but wants to limit his exposure to violent games, thats a good parent, especially since she probably knows he is going to so she gives him limited access.   She also said to go watch a movie with her, family time is never bad I am 30 and I just got done holding my nephew for 20 minutes during fireworks with my mom and sisters and was super excited to see my momma, so there is nothing wrong with family time... ever.  You obviously do not understand what family values are or even moral values which is fine, if thats you then that is you so long as you aren't harming people. However, there is nothing wrong with this mom trying to raise her son right and you bet your ass if my nephew ever said something to my sister like that at the end, he wouldn't have to worry about momma but have to worry about uncle; joking around is one thing but you do not disrespect your parents, especially if there trying to do right by you (inb4, I know not all parents are good and their are shit ones, trust me I know.

What is the effect really going to be? It'd be one thing if she didn't want him to be lazy or wanted him to exercise or do school work ect. Go play the ipad? watch a movie with me?  Also I never said a thing about family time, but I find watching a movie with my parents is hardly ""family time"" you don't build much in the way of relationships, and it's not a really memorable or great activity. It's the same reason you don't take a first date to a movie, you don't get much of anything by watching a movie with someone. That was also not her only suggestion so she clearly didn't care about the family time or family aspect anyways.  Also I have no idea where you're final comment is even coming from. ""bad boys""? Not sure where you got that impression. Also this is not posted by the mother or the son, I don't know either of them and I'm not tell her how to raise her child. I wouldn't know how to contact her even if I wanted too."

Ya know this thing called legal parental rights and such? How parents have legal parental judgement and say over us until we are 18?   Want's to limit his time playing violent games. Why? What is the effect really going to be?   Again, because its his mothers decision and since hes probably around 14? She decided its not best for him, that is her choice and its her house, her system, her game because he sure as hell did not buy it and she can decide if he plays it or not.   Also I never said a thing about family time,** but I find watching a movie with my parents is hardly ""family time""** you don't build much in the way of relationships   Injecting your own reality into his I see, because its how you do it, its how everyone should do it? Maybe his mom finds that as family time? I invite my sisters over to watch movies for family time all the time, its just about being around family doing an activity together even a movie.   It's the same reason you don't take a first date to a movie,   Apples to Oranges, first date you are trying to find out if your compatible to date each other, just fuck, be friends or never talk again; Family time is about just spending time with family, before we had all this shit, games and all that family time was literally sitting around the TV and watching sitcoms. Family time does not have to be meaningful, memorable or a huge / great activity.   That was also not her only suggestion so she clearly didn't care about the family time or family aspect anyways.   Because you know what shes thinking in her head that was not said based on things she said? Again, injecting your own reality in that one.  Point is, you probably have a different family or thoughts of family. This mother is obviously caring about her son enough to be part of his life... there are people who have never even met both of their parents let alone have a parent care about them. Yes, even though they seem to be arguing, trust me she cares."

I catch his Hearthstone vids from time to time, just assumed he still did SC2 stuff too. Come to think of it, why do I watch Hearthstone videos?

One of them is a complete asshole and will wreck your arm if you so much as even get near it, whether or not your intention is to be near her. Another is very playful, constantly needing attention, and the other just sits by himself. He doesn't mind being pet wherever you want to pet him, as long as he's awake. If you wake him up, he's just a grump.  Another friend also has cats that will knock literally every glass over that they can, so she switched to ceramic cups. For some reason they don't care to knock over something they can't see through.  Owning 3 cats doesn't make you an expert on ALL cats because not every cat is the same."

LivestreamFails,3awokp,Senzu,12,Wed Jun 24 20:34:20 2015 UTC,"Twitch has VERY few legit ""camwhores.""  The definition way too many people use is basically a girl who wears a tank top, any form of shorts, etc. and occasionally stands up and walks away from the camera to do something.  Having a sub board is an instant camwhore designation as it involves turning away from the stream.    Because in every day life, women flaunt their bodies purely for attention by walking a direction away from you and showing off their booties in shorts.  Most moral people see this and demand women stop wearing shorts that don't go to at least finger tip length, tank tops that show midriff, and other immodest clothing choices as written in the Henderson County Christian School handbook.  But for real, the fact people think a girl is a whore because she turns around to write a name on a sub board is ridiculous.  If you can't handle a woman wearing shorts that my 90 year old grandmother doesn't have an issue with, you've got a problem.  Hell, and people wonder why society shits themselves over nipples on TV."

As someone who has wandered the streets of San Francisco at 3 AM, you see unadulterated homelessness. I've seen crazy people jive dancing. I had a woman come up to me, asking for a dollar to buy a hot dog at 7/11 at 3 IN THE MORNING. Shortly after that, I had a guy asking for a couple of dollars for a burger. You have to be really hungry to be wandering for money in the wee hours of the morning. People waste their money in so many ways but they're too scared to give a dollar because they might buy libations. Even if they did buy booze, they are fucking homeless. I think I might want a drink if I'm smelly, hungry, and sleeping on in the streets. Granted, you can't give all your money away but I try to give whenever I can."

I mean, 20-30 years CSGO will still be going strong and all that $$ you spent collecting gun skins will have been worth it. The playerbase will be 100x bigger and the internet items will be worth 100x more. It's not like valve or some other company is going to create a new game that involves collectable virtual items thus making the old games obsolete. CSGO will be around for a long long time.

LivestreamFails,3awokp,tupendous,82,Wed Jun 24 06:33:47 2015 UTC,"Ahh another case of rich entitled streamers gambling thousands of dollars.  ex post from another thread, but still relevant.   ""This doesn't surprise me in the least. Sodapoppin recently went on Twitter bragging about gambling literally $6000/USD (donation money) in a matter of hours and losing it.  I find it somewhat ironic that someone who 3 years ago was asking for donations to help with medical bills due to someone in his family being ill, is now a guy who is now a home owner, numerous cars, makes easily 6 figures and gambles/brags about losing 6 grand in a matter of hours.  https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/567897587937734656 https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/568070491111452673  Recently on April 4th he mentioned going to Casino again. (I just opened his Twitter page and found this in 2 minutes) no I don't follow him nor do I watch/sub to his stream anymore. (2 years ago I'd be lying). https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/584564628069285888  Sad to see these streamers acting like these donations support them in the sense of paying food/gas/electricity/health/investment for the streamer. But they're pretty much funding a 21 year old kids gambling addiction, who already alone from his Twitch/YT/Sub revenue makes more in 1 year than most people will earn with Bachelor degrees in their lives in that time span of 1 year.  Don't get me wrong though, this isn't a ""LETS BASH SODAPOPPIN"" clearly he worked hard and developed that following to be put in the position to receive such a huge income. He's a talented individual and lets not take that away from him, he knew his audience and managed to make it grow from 50-120 viewers streaming 2v2 on Arena Tournament (WOTLK Private Server) to averaging 20k concurrent viewers.  tl;dr Money changes people."""

LivestreamFails,3a66pp,Killerjas,10,Thu Jun 18 05:32:54 2015 UTC,"To be honest, after Wings got kicked off/left, the show got stale in my opinion. Wings, the over the top guy with the weirdest views on certain events and his unexpected answers really added something spicy to the show. Something that is lacking on the current form of PKA. Yeah, Murkah tries to be in some weird way a less controversial version of Wings, but its just... I don't know, the same topics and nothing interesting or make me laugh like it was when Wings was still on PKA"
LivestreamFails,3a66pp,CruiseBiscuits,8,Sun Jun 21 09:20:48 2015 UTC,"To me, Wings brought the whole show down a notch in intellect. Right now it has grown up, just like I have and I really do appreciate that they don't just talk about COD and silly stuff all the time. I enjoy these 3 middle class white dudes as people, so I am entertained even when they may not be ""putting on a show."" The show has moved on from the crazy stuff because that, believe it or not, got stale. People always say they want the old controversial days back, but if they tried, it would just be forced.  I will grant you that it did get stale right after wings left and it was just Lefty, Kyle and Woody for a slew of episodes until Murka came on. It took a while for me to warm up to him but I will say again, the show is in a golden age right now. If you left when Wings left and it was just Lefty and if you haven't seen any of the recent ones, you have no idea what I'm talking about. I you need to take up some air time like at work or in the car, I highly recommend it."

Kyle now shows his face, Wings came back twice and once with his personal trainer. I can't choose a best one to start with, but from this section I'd say start with one from 218-234, or whichever catches your fancy. They also do an hour long midweek show, Painkiller Nearly. It's just Kyle and Woody because Murka's schedule doesn't allow it but I love it."

LivestreamFails,3a66pp,vanguard_anon,20,Fri Jun 19 02:11:27 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the money from ads has decreased a lot.  My streams tend to go for about 3 hours and hover around the 300-500 viewer mark.  I'll typically get around $2-$3 in ad money for each stream.  If I ran ads more aggressively I could probably get that up to $10 or so but it's still a very small amount of money.  Donations on the other hand, can be pretty good for top streamers and streamers that really push them. (I'm neither of those)"

I mean I love watching one streamer in particular, but I'm never going to donate ever probably ...

Every sunday we went to my DM's place to continue our campaign, where we had a separate room set up. Unfortunately he was engaged to a girl who demanded far too much attention. She would make up any excuse to complain or to distract us from playing.   She baked a cake for us and afterwards complained we weren't appreciative enough. She claimed the cat was getting crazy because of our presence, and kicked us out numerous times because of this. She'd start vacuum cleaning the apartment, including the room we were playing in. She would make up excuses to ask her boyfriend, our DM, to come help her. These were all things that weren't urgent at all (e.g., ""I'm making a shopping list for tomorrow, can you come look and tell me what you want?"") She invited her friends over and kicked us out because we were too loud and they couldn't 'hear each other talk'. Keep in mind: she knew we'd game every sunday at 6pm and neither notified us or her boyfriend. Basically half an hour into the game we could pack our shit already, and for two of us it took an hour to get there.   They eventually got married, but she ended up leaving her husband for some other guy from our D&D group (she was crazy, but also good looking). At this point our DM had a meltdown and only a few of us continued with our own group, which at first didn't fare much better. The new DM's place was very nice, but his roommate kicked us out on a rather aggressive coke-fueled rampage. We decided not to go there anymore. We ended up in the tiniest of all rooms but no further crazy-people issues. Well, one of our players quit our group because his now ex-girlfriend threatened to burn all his books as he wasn't spending enough time with her.  That was all the out of game crazy, condensed in my early years of D&D. All is well now!"

There's several options here:   Play with friends you know are interested in the game: In this case you need to find someone willing to be a DM, and that's likely going to be you! Play with strangers from your local friendly game store (LFGS): D&D Encounters is an event your LFGS can participate in, designed for ease of entry for new and old players. Other game systems may also be used by your LFGS. Play online using roll20.net: Browse their community forums or /r/LFG to find a group, and use roll20 to as a tool to play the game. It's a virtual tabletop designed for PnP RPGs. It has a game map/board, voice/video chat, music tools, customizable dice tools, unit icons, etc.      Game System There are too many systems to list, so I'll list a few I have personal experience with and/or can recommend.   Dungeons & Dragons 5e: No experience with this one, but I only hear very good things about it. The game is one of the easier ones to get a grip on and play, but still requires some reading into the player's handbook (PHB) for players and DM, and the dungeon master's guide (DMG) specifically for the DM. You use the monster manual (MM) only for creating combat encounters. At the price of $150 ($50 per book) for the PHB, DMG, and MM (all gameplay essentials) it's quite a steep entry price. It is advised that your players also get the PHB so they can read through and understand the rules. If you play this at an LFGS (through D&D encounters for instance) the players an DM will usually be very friendly in introducing you, so you don't necessarily need to buy into anything just yet other than dice. You need roughly 1 or 2 of each dice for this (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20) but you can usually get those quite cheap. Numenera: My favorite. It's ridiculously easy to get in to, yet very expanded in terms of content. Unlike D&D, the mechanics tie in more to the setting but the setting is fantastic. You only need the core book to get started, which comes at a $60 price tag. Your players don't necessarily have to buy it. I read it and it took me about 30 minutes to not only explain all the rules but also build characters. We had no problem playing what so ever. This system is very easy on the DM too, so if it's your first time DMing this system is in my opinion the best. The dice you need are one d20, one d6, and a pair of d10s. Dungeons & Dragons 3.5e: It's the system I grew up with after we dumped 3e. However, it's best to ignore it because the books aren't easy to get and it is no longer being worked on. Compared to Numenera and D&D 5e the rules are a bit more convoluted as well. If you can find the books cheap, though, it's not a bad system at all and has a lot of existing content already. I would argue this is currently the most influential D&D version out there. I can't give a price on the books, but the dice requirements are similar to D&D 5e. Pathfinder: This is the reason I did not recommend 3.5. After WotC decided to work on 4e and drop 3.5e, Paizo went ahead and published Pathfinder. It uses the same system reference document as D&D 3.5 but introduces some balancing fixes that make the gameplay more smooth. They also add unique new content such as an entire campaign setting. It only has one corebook which you can buy, but you can also read the online system reference document.   All in all, my #1 recommendation is Numenera, but if you're only interested in D&D because of its name, then I suggest D&D 5e.     Materials All your players need a good set of dice, unless you play using roll20.net. I suggest you start with a premade adventure because it is easiest and it teaches you how to create adventures yourself. All of the games I've listed above have a lot of premade adventures you can buy (and they're usually not very expensive).  On your first day it's best to expect no gameplay just yet. You need to explain the rules and create characters. Make sure to take good time building the characters, including background and what the players intend to achieve with them. For this purpose you print character sheets, which you can find for free in PDF form on the websites of the respective systems (or by googling).  A battle mat and miniatures are not strictly necessary. It may make things easier, also heavily depending on what system you use. For instance, D&D 4th edition is almost impossible to play without a miniatures. I can suggest the chessex battle mat and heroforge miniatures if you're interested in using miniatures, although I suggest that for the systems I recommended above you try Mind's Eye Theater, which is a fancy term for saying that you're not using anything to represent the characters and the combat field other than your imagination (as you roughly know positioning of characters, for instance).  The DM should be familiar with the rules. If you go to an LFGS they'll likely help you out, but it would be very nice if you have at least read through the rules already. In any other case you should just read through at least the PHB/Core book to know what your character can do.      DM tips  If you're going to DM, then I have a few tips for you. The list is not exhaustive and you learn new things every day.   Have fun. Seriously. Don't get hung up on rules, because in the end you want to have a good time. Don't get hung up on rules. If you don't know something, wing it. Don't spend minutes searching through the books. You can do that after the session. The DM has something called ""rule 0"". Basically, anything the DM says goes. Don't let this go to your head, though. It's there to help the DM make a final decision to continue gameplay. It's not there for you to railroad your players. Don't railroad your players. By this I mean that you shouldn't push your players in the direction you prepared and leaving no other options open. For instance: You prepared a dungeon, but the players decide to ignore it for now. No big deal. You just recycle that dungeon into whatever dungeon they decide to end up visiting instead. Keep the same concept, but change the skin. Instead of a natural cave it's now a cellar. Your PCs won't notice the difference. Try to involve all your players and figure out what they want from the game (hence spending good time on their background stories during character creation). That way no one gets bored. Every time you only interact with 1 player, the others will be doing nothing. If that happens too often, you'll notice people start playing with their phones or lose interest. You can prevent that by involving the team in most cases. If you eventually want to design your own adventures, then I suggest looking closely at what the adventure packs do. One mistake I have made is to create huge labyrinthine dungeons with twisting corridors, dead ends, and many many rooms. Instead, you should stick to the 5 room dundgeon design for the optimal results.   Anyway, I hope this helps. If you have any specific questions feel free to ask."

He surrounds himself with people who tell him he's great/entertaining/funny only to feed his own ego. Glad I never browse the Runescape section.   But the WoW section has their fair share of drunk driving self entitled rich children. (No I won't say who).

I used to watch him during Xfire, and his early Justin.TV days to say he's been this way forever is simply incorrect. Chance when he was dorming and receiving donations used to skip meals and talked about how he needed to ""save money"".  Fast Forward 2-3 years later he's openly Tweeting about how he lost $6000 in a couple of hours at a Casino. Every week at least once he gets fake drunk on stream and does stupid silly things for donations.   College Kid skipping a meal to ""save money"" =/= Entitled young 21 year old on Twitter getting $6000 USD in cash and bragging about how he lost it all.   Also his ""you're fucking dumb for donating"" ect... is more of an act than anything. He's playing to his audience, he knows he'll still get subs/donations regardless if he gets them fuckheads/shit heads/retards. The chat calls themselves retards/psychos and a ""creature of their own"".   Edit: Another example, someone in his family was ill with what I believe was allegedly cancer and Soda openly asked viewers to donate so that individual could receive the treatment necessary and pay the medical bills. Someone who is using their platform to assist family or someone who is willing to sit through hunger to save a few bucks."

Just because at one point he didn't have money, and now he does have money, does NOT mean that he's changed or lost humility. He cannot control the amount of money given to him. Also, he still skips meals just so he can stream for his viewers. Just watching him the other day, it had been 7pm and he still hadn't eaten... Not to mention that just because he tweeted that he lost money, does not mean that he's bragging about it. You're assuming quite a lot and putting them into a context that suits your agenda."

I'm not assuming anything, who openly TWEETS sharing that hey look ""I've lost $6000 USD!"".   Also your point of skipping meals for streaming vs having the money/saving are comparing two seperate situations.  The situation I was in was Chance saying he was hungry, but the food place was closed and he didn't wanna waste money on delivery so he skipped the meal.  I still don't understand your logic of ""he tweeted he lost"" so what? He's openly saying ""Hey look here's $6000 USD, I'm gonna just gamble it in a Casino and if I lose it oh well"". Regardless of tweeting it or not, the way he's spending is income speaks to how he's changed. I'm sure Chance Morris in his dorm room would say ""You're fucking dumb if you lose $6000 USD in a matter of hours at Casino save the money or buy a million fleshlights/hire hookers"".   I haven't assumed anything, it seems like you're simply nit picking and a fan white knighting. Your whole PoV is bias as shit, it's pointless to even discuss it. You're defending someone you like/enjoy.  If there's one thing I learned about Twitch fans, people will go to the grave for their idols/streamers and backwards rationalize their defense.

I have no bias, and could careless whether people actually like him or not, he's just pure entertainment.

LivestreamFails,3777h8,MILK_DUD_NIPPLES,11,Tue May 26 10:35:10 2015 UTC,"Kripp simply doesn't care, and Forsen revels in the fact that he's got the most cancerous stream. Plus, as you say, it brings in the donations."
LivestreamFails,3777h8,Mikchi,27,Tue May 26 14:25:14 2015 UTC,"To an extent I can understand it for like sub-only Sundays or something to give back to those who pay  4.99 and support your stream. But you're right it does have this weird arrogance vibe to it.  But not always, I know streamers like Soda/Summit/Lirik literally need it to visually read the chat. This guys stream isn't one of those cases.  I remember when Ducksauce tried to make it so subs could only watch VoDs/ or his stream in HD, ended up backfiring in his face. Luckily for him he quickly changed it and didn't face too much backlash for his money grubbing behavior."
LivestreamFails,3777h8,ShammyWoWLoL,6,Mon May 25 22:14:09 2015 UTC,Really? Cirno_tv has around the same viewers as you and he interacts with his chat non stop with no submode/slowmode
LivestreamFails,3777h8,FUCKFACED_REPOSTER,1 point,Tue May 26 01:00:03 2015 UTC,"With respect, speedrunning leaves a LOT of room for non-stop chat interaction due to the nature of speedrunning having a lot of ""down-time"" between the high concentration segments.   That really depends on the game.  I don't stream, but i run Postal 2 from time to time and i'd be able to chat/read chat all the time, theres a lot of running"
LivestreamFails,3777h8,BeeKayTF2,3,Tue May 26 02:28:40 2015 UTC,"Why not use slow mode?  As much I don't like it, I find it much better than subs only, because it(subs only) presents an elitist attitude in my opinion, as oh, you want say something about your favorite streamer, pay $5.  Yes, Twitch becomes cancer the larger your viewbase gets, but I would never enforce subs only if I streamed or had a big enough stream that's it's viable for me to do so."

I don't like to watch the guy(but I do when he does certain activities and there's nothing on) and I think he's pretty cringeworthy at times, but what the guy you're responding to said is just plain wrong.  His chat is open almost all the time and in fact if his mod puts it into subscriber only mode he'll tell them not to and change it back to open.  And in regards to the bans, he really isn't ban happy at all, even though his chat is full of trolls(which is basically the exact opposite of what was said above) and there have been quite a few instances that I've seen him unban people just because they ask nicely ingame.  TL;DR: There's a lot Sparc can be criticized for(donations for song requests???), but what Shammy said is almost entirely false and he doesn't deserve hate for that."

I pretty much assumed he was part of that toxic self circle jerking community that Twitch has created, perhaps he's not. I apologize for blanketing him in if he's not that type of streamer and in fact if he was simply just joking and being sarcastic."

Imagine someone giving you $500 then Streamtip takes 1%. Say that $500 gets reversed, there is no money but Streamtip will charge you the certain percentage still. Yea there is a process to fix it, but it's still another way of annoying the streamer.  It's just another way of getting to the streamer that trolls use from my experience.

Work with your fellow streamers don't alienate them.  Networking can be done with streamers with high or low viewer count than you, you don't just have to target big streamers, target your own level or even smaller streamers for networking, but also don't let anyone take advantage of you either.  The fear of losing a viewer to someone else is a made up fear in your head, because you don't own these people, and they will watch what they enjoy, you cant protect your viewers from seeing someone they might enjoy watching more than you.   All this does is cause you stress, and diverts your attention from the real issue, the quality of your show in the first place, and also promoting your show via networking :P"

LivestreamFails,36ynqx,TTVRaptor,93,Sat May 23 05:53:26 2015 UTC,Ahh Crumps the man who single handedly destroyed his own very successful Binding of Isaac tournament simply because he was not happy people were making money streaming during his tournament.  This guy gets huge power trips anytime he gets an ounce of power over something. He always wants to exploit it and never is willing to admit he abuses it when called out. He plays the victim and does typical stupid shit.
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Oldwise,6,Sun May 24 23:16:54 2015 UTC,Could you go into more detail about him destroying the Boilr races? I honestly believe you because I remember how confrontational and pissy he can get but I haven't heard much about that.
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Tru_bearshark,27,Mon May 25 23:10:58 2015 UTC,"This was about 1 to 1.25 years back now(not 100% sure the exact time). He was running the 2nd or 3rd ""season"" of Boilr and a lot of the casters that were running were BOI casters who many got partnership/sub button off exposure from the tournament. Meanwhile Crumps was not getting more than a couple hundred viewers when he wasnt streaming the tournament. Crumps was not happy about this.   He pretended to be happy about it in front of everyone saying stuff like ""its great for the community and great for the streamers."" This didn't stop him from implementing rules that were aimed at stopping streamers from claiming any monetary value of tournament streamed matches.  They were not allowed to stream ads. They were not supposed to save the VoD for their own youtubes. They were not supposed to acknowledge monetary gains during races(subs/donations). I also heard rumors that they would have to pay to get into the following leagues(never seen this confirmed).   Once some people got wind of this they stopped joining and stopped racing. People tried to keep some what quiet of it. Most of the racers were very hush hush about the issue not wanting to smear Crumps' name about it.  I remember when BOILr died he would ban anyone who mentioned it even if they were just concerned or not informed."
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Oldwise,13,Tue May 26 03:38:44 2015 UTC,"Jeez I knew he was petty but that is just messed up, and here he is going on about lost wages.  The fact Balls of Steel is so popular must be killing him and you know what, that's good, crumps doesn't deserve that popularity."
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Tru_bearshark,9,Tue May 26 10:18:11 2015 UTC,BoS came from Cobalt who was one of the first runners to ditch BOILr  because of how shitty Crumps was about the situation. Crumps had the biggest problem with Cobalt from what I have heard(again a rumor).
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Oldwise,8,Tue May 26 18:32:05 2015 UTC,"Honestly it makes a bit of sense, Cobalt is now the biggest pure Issac streamer(yes he plays other games regularly but his numbers are at their highest when Issac is on) and he kinda became the main attraction for Boilr with his undefeated streak.  So I could see that rumor being true in some way but unless some one involved confirms it, it's just highly believable hearsay."
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Tru_bearshark,13,Tue May 26 18:43:02 2015 UTC,I love how everyone just moved to BoS league
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Bochhhhh,11,Tue May 26 12:43:04 2015 UTC,Crumps' shitty behavior was a major reason people moved over. And the fact Cobalt is 100 times more like able than Crumps. Even though I myself an not the biggest fan of Cobalt.
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Oldwise,2,Tue May 26 18:35:50 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and honestly BoS is much better than Boilr was in my mind, and besides the drama from the first Issac races about them disqualifying that one racer I don't think I've heard much over it."

And modding for channels under 1-2k viewers is very easy since it's pretty laid back. Especially a smaller stream where not a lot of people are even typing or when everyone knows each other."

LivestreamFails,36ynqx,SuleyBlack,8,Mon May 25 00:17:50 2015 UTC,Then why did you feel the need to name drop?
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Scrubing,-6,Mon May 25 04:56:12 2015 UTC,To give a perspective really. Not gloating or anything. Like I said channels are a fair bit different when they're smaller. Smaller channels have a vastly slower chat. Meaning less to actually do. Same with less influx of new viewers as well. While some channels are big enough and require enough attention the broadcasters even pay them to essentially work for the channel.
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,SuleyBlack,8,Mon May 25 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"There is never a need to name drop like you did, hell I'm a lead mod on a channel that has been the highest viewed stream on Twitch when high viewer counts was close to 30k.  Where in that previous statement is anything relevant to the argument? Correct answer, it doesn't. All you've stated is actually common sense and honestly a bunch of streamers have 0 PR skills which often get themselves in trouble."
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,HellBryant3,11,Mon May 25 06:41:48 2015 UTC,"The only person who has the right to say they're a ""professional twitch mod"" is someone who is an Admin / Global Mod / Staff... since then they're actually doing something.

LivestreamFails,36ynqx,MystifiedMustard,-7,Mon May 25 07:20:24 2015 UTC,"especially some random channels with 300 viewers     erm, but you're some random channel with <300 viewers, and you went on a modding spree like 2 or 3 weeks ago with like 9 mods watching at once, while you had 60 people watching. For people like us, getting mod in a channel is like getting a twitch diploma. It might not seem like much to you because you rule that part of twitch with an iron paw, but to us, even getting mod in a channel with <40 viewers feels like an accomplishment. also, if a professional twitch mod is only a title for twitch staff, are riotgames mods the same as mods in channels with 50-100 viewers? Are Kaceytron mods the same as mods in your channel? No, I thought so. LoL mods have to go through 100x the shit that your mods have to go though, giving them the same rank as your mods is a fucking disgrace. I wouldn't have downvoted if you just said the first paragraph of your comment, but ""since they're actually doing something"" is just sad to see from someone as familiar with twitch as you. Not to mention, you use the ""I'm a lirik mod"" card more than the amount of times you've gone full sellout. Signed, one of your longest subscribers, at over a year."
LivestreamFails,36ynqx,Corvese,12,Mon May 25 13:48:35 2015 UTC,even getting mod in a channel with <40 viewers feels like an accomplishment.   Speak for yourself. I think anybody who cares about getting mod anywhere is retarded.

LivestreamFails,36hhw2,StabbyMcRunFast,7,Tue May 19 16:50:37 2015 UTC,From watching clips of people play fifa games I gather it's a card game?
LivestreamFails,36hhw2,DudeWithTheNose,10,Tue May 19 17:47:31 2015 UTC,"There's a game mode on FIFA called Ultimate Team (FUT), whereby you can create your own team and play in both online and offline tournaments or divisions. Each football/soccer player has their own card (and in some cases several), which can either be obtained via the opening of 'packs' or through a real transfer market. You can purchase packs using FIFA points (which you buy with Microsoft/PSN credit) or with coins that you've gained through playing matches or through trading. There are three main kind of packs, those being gold, silver and bronze. They correspond to player ranking, the highest being gold and the lowest being bronze. As you can imagine, the gold packs are more expensive than the bronze packs. However, if you're wondering why there's a need for anything other than top players, then there are tournaments that require bronze only players, for example. It can also add more variety to the gameplay.  I don't know how good of an explanation this is, but those are pretty much the basics. There are little in the way of limits as to what teams you can build. You could, for example, create a team comprised of gold, silver, and bronze players, each one being from a different nationality and from a different league. The trouble there is that there's a thing called team chemistry, which has a bearing on how in-sync your team is, so to speak. A team comprised solely of Brazilian nationals is going to play better than a team of multiple nationalities from multiple leagues.   There's more to it, too, as you can get fitness cards, cards to heal injuries, cards for team kits, stadia, cards that change position, cards that enhance attributes and so on.  TL;DR Kinda, but you actually play games of football/soccer, too. Madden and NHL also have Ultimate Team modes."

The pack opening video things always show up on my reccomended videos on youtube for some reason.    The last FIFA I played way on PS2 and even then I preferred Pro Evo (most of my friends did). I'd be keen to find out if they actually improved the game since as Konami is basically pulling out of game development.
LivestreamFails,36hhw2,tommygunner91,1 point,Wed May 27 07:27:11 2015 UTC,"Fifa is on a downward spiral ever since they decided Ultimate Team should be their focus for the game at the expense of everything else (Career Mode hasn't had one of my favourite features since 08, Visual Sim) and I haven't actually bought a Fifa game since Fifa 10, because after renting them for a week or 2, I've got bored of them.   Pro Evolution Soccer has lost it's touch ever since the PS3/360 when they decided to try and rival Fifa without any of the licenses,so now you have a game that's trying to take itself too seriously and has lost the fun it had during the PS2 era.

LivestreamFails,369123,sumwut,10,Sun May 17 13:14:10 2015 UTC,ehhh yeah I certainly wasn't meant that way...but it's not a good idea to compare black people with monkeys

LivestreamFails,369123,flemmorg,31,Sun May 17 22:34:41 2015 UTC,"The only reason the monkey thing is considered racist is because people use to say it and still do as a derogatory thing. Like people throwing bananas at black players at soccer matches in Europe isn't a friendly gesture.  The comments in the video weren't derogatory, they were just an actual neutral observation. People in the past would call blacks  monkeys in a form of hate and racism, and that's why it is generally watched out for as racist because it usually is someone being racist.  That said I've seen people of all races exhibit looks and behaviors of rats, dogs, monkeys etc... we're all animals."

LivestreamFails,369123,Hsinhan,1 point,Sun May 17 23:10:40 2015 UTC,"The failure on your part is that he didn't say the black guy looks like a monkey, he said the black guy performed an action that monkeys often perform and humans don't.   Since you clearly don't understand the point I'm making, let's look at it this way:  Scenario 1: Commentator notices a white guy doing the monkey lip thing and says, ""Oh he's doing that monkey thing."" End result? This is ignored and no one thinks anything of it.  Scenario 2: Commentator notices an Asian guy doing the monkey lip thing and says, ""Oh he's doing that monkey thing."" End result? This is ignored and no one thinks anything of it.  Scenario 3: Commentator notices a Latino doing the monkey lip thing and says, ""Oh he's doing that monkey thing."" End result? This is ignored and no one thinks anything of it.  What happened in the video: Commentator notices a black man doing the monkey lip thing and says, ""Oh he's doing that monkey thing."" End result? People cry ""RACIST!"" and upload it to youtube and reddit.  That's pretty much what I mean by ""you can't point anything out about black people or it's racist."""

Someone then said it's not a good idea to compare black people to monkeys even if it's not meant in a racist way, to which I replied that he wasn't comparing the person to the animal but rather the action, and then on a tangent I regarded how explosive any sort of commentary on a black person can become.

LivestreamFails,369123,MestR,2,Sun May 17 20:01:47 2015 UTC,"It is a glitch.  The longer a combo goes in marvel, the less stun is inflicted. This means a combo can't go on forever because eventually you instantly flip out of hitstun.  Some super moves invoke cinematics, and these moves have fixed hitstun scaling (otherwise you could fall out of them if used at the end of a long combo)  A DHC  is when you cancel a suprt into a partners super. When this is done between certain supers (a cinematic one into one that whiffs, or one that doesn't directly hit the oppoenent) the game RESETS damage and hitstun scaling, and you get to continue the combo as if you are starting a new combo, without actually starting a new one.  The result is that you do WAY more damage after the DHC than was intended. This was patched but used to be an important part to the competitive game."

LivestreamFails,35sujn,ideagle,35,Wed May 13 07:25:16 2015 UTC,"What you are watching is the last boss of Zelda II, Dark Link. He will randomly perform one of three attacks if you go to the left side of the screen like this guy did. If you are lucky you can kill him really quickly. With bad RNG luck, the fight will take 3-4 times as long like it did now, which caused him to not beat his previous best time."

LivestreamFails,35sujn,Krozni,5,Wed May 13 14:22:29 2015 UTC,"Hail RNGesus. RNG=Random Number Generator. Anytime you see RNG, you can pretty much replace it with 'randomness factor'. There's some degree of randomness in many (if not all) games. In this context, there were 3 different actions the boss could take, chosen at random. RNG determined that the boss took X action instead of Y or Z. X was not the preferred action for the speedrunner, because it extended the time of the fight.  This is a rudimentary explanation. Think 'critical strike chance' for RNG. You have 20% crit chance. The game rolls a 100-sided die. If the number it lands on is between 1-20, you critically strike. If it's between 21-100, you do not. If you have 55% crit chance, the die must land on 1-55 to critically strike."

LivestreamFails,35sujn,kyoushunsui,26,Wed May 13 08:34:45 2015 UTC,he wasted time   I mean technically the game wasted time  I'm not familiar with Zelda 2 speed runs but I know that the final boss you need to sit in the bottom left corner and wait for him to come to you.  If the boss is doing all this weird maneuvering/horseshit in between coming at you you are essentially helpless with the clock ticking.  the RNG rekt him

LivestreamFails,35sujn,Arvendilin,3,Wed May 13 16:08:31 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming because he was just short of beating a world record (or just getting a good time and setting a personal goal)... in speedrunning, there are a ton of people just grinding these games trying to beat them flawlessly for a perfect time, so every little second counts since that's what differentiates a lot of top runs"
LivestreamFails,35sujn,multiplyinghorsey,3,Wed May 13 16:37:26 2015 UTC,"It must've been personal, then. I guess he's really passionate about getting better at these runs and getting that flawless time. judging from the pace shown on his stream, this was a huge stepping stone for him and it was kinda ruined by bad RNG which nobody wants- to get screwed by something completely out of your control is one of the worst feelings"

I'm sorry I'm pretty casual with live streamer knowledge but doesn't this guy make revenue off of his stream? I've seen wives and moms disrespect these guys while they're making money because they can't grasp the concept of what or why they are doing what they do. Even though it's the ignorant other party's fault for not understanding, I still think the streamers should find a studio away from home to make their money streaming."
LivestreamFails,35if2n,SpadesAspade,28,Sun May 17 06:53:54 2015 UTC,"Yes but most of the time the revenue they make is very small. Unless you're a popular streamer or you get lucky to get one of those big donations that aren't chargebacks, you'll probably make way about... $30 a day? Maybe even less, and that is if you have dedicated people."
LivestreamFails,35if2n,Reggiardito,11,Wed May 13 04:11:27 2015 UTC,Thanks for kicking knowledge my way. I empathize with these unconventional money earners though still because I used to earn money developing flash games as a minor and noone understood shit until I got paypal'd the results. Not enough to rent a studio so maybe I should've said they need to sit these ignorant mother fuckers down and have a grown-ass-man chat.
LivestreamFails,35if2n,SpadesAspade,18,Wed May 13 04:25:37 2015 UTC,"From what I understand it's only been in the past few years that people earn anything from streaming. Society still has a ""you need a 9 to 5 job making $X/hour"" mindset."

LivestreamFails,35if2n,Trumpetatoes,3,Wed May 13 15:48:50 2015 UTC,Agreed.  A lot of people dive in with no money saved up or way to support themselves and are convinced they're going to be raking in money within a few months.  A lot of people making phenomenal to decent livings with Twitch but they definitely still put in a huge amount of time to get it to that point.

LivestreamFails,35if2n,SWAGmoose,11,Tue Jun 9 01:53:47 2015 UTC,Well if those streamers get a huge amount of money they're likely living on their own and don't have to deal with this kind of stuff. Or they can just show their parents their bank account/paypal to shut them up.
LivestreamFails,35if2n,Reggiardito,5,Wed May 13 17:08:51 2015 UTC,"Yep, probably.   Just to clarify, I'm not disagreeing with you, most streamers don't make money"

LivestreamFails,35if2n,Kentucky6996,58,Mon May 11 00:38:51 2015 UTC,"Normally at that event, the speedrunner gets to choose who is on the couch to do commentary. As far as I understand, in this particular run, Chibi just invited himself on the couch without being asked and Caveman (the runner) decided to just roll with it instead of starting drama by kicking him off. However, Chibi wouldn't stop talking and constantly chimed in (this is frowned upon, since it distracts the runner) while avoiding social ques to be quiet (which is understandable since he apparently has Asperger's or something).   Caveman made a brief video shortly after this took place talking about it, check it out to see his side of things: https://youtu.be/w8rUzA8O_aQ"

The speedrun marathon events are great. Both to watch the games go quick and also to witness the severe autism.  The Arkham City run last year was fucking rage-inducing. I love the game but holy shit the runners were up their own ass about how good they were at breaking it."

The guy speedrunning is allowed to invite people on the couch, you can't really come, if you're not invited, and autism guy wasn't, but there wasn't a lot of people, so he sat down.  He keeps making jokes, none of them getting any laugh, but the poor kid keeps on truckin', not taking a hint. Let the speedrunner play, talk if you know something about the game, or if asked.

This kid doesn't get it (which makes sense considering his age), but he doesn't recognize that his entire lifestyle is a gift and he either needs to move out and make his own rules or play ball with the landlord.

Of course you can always beat a living creature into submission but it doesn't necessarily create a semblance of respect towards the person who is carrying out the beating. Check out some more info about countries banning corporal punishment: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporal_punishment Pretty interesting stuff!
LivestreamFails,35if2n,Murbah,1 point,Mon May 11 03:08:21 2015 UTC,"Corporal punishment:       Corporal punishment is a form of physical punishment that involves the deliberate infliction of pain in order to punish a person convicted of a crime or as retribution for a perceived offence, including physical chastisement such as spanking, paddling, or caning of minors by parents, guardians, or school or other officials.  Official punishment by the infliction of pain or injury, including flogging, branding, and amputation, was practised in most civilisations since ancient times. However, with the growth of humanitarian ideals since the Enlightenment, such punishments were increasingly viewed as inhumane, a barbaric relic of bygone times. By the late 20th century, corporal punishment had been eliminated from the legal systems of most developed countries.   Corporal punishment in the twenty-first century may be divided into three main types:   Parental or domestic corporal punishment: within the family—typically, punishment of children or teenagers by parents or guardians; School corporal punishment: within schools, when students are punished by teachers or school administrators, or, in the past, apprentices by master craftsmen; Judicial corporal punishment: as part of a criminal sentence ordered by a court of law. Closely related is prison corporal punishment or disciplinary corporal punishment, ordered by prison authorities or carried out directly by staff.   The legality of various forms of corporal punishment differs by jurisdiction. Corporal punishment has traditionally been considered in many cultures an acceptable way of correction of children by adults with direct authority over them,  but has fallen into disfavor in recent decades, especially in Western countries. It has been banned in an increasing number of jurisdictions:  Corporal punishment of minors within domestic settings has been officially outlawed in 46 countries as of April 2015.   Corporal punishment in schools has been outlawed in many countries, including Canada, Kenya, South Africa, New Zealand and nearly all of Europe.  Judicial corporal punishment has long disappeared from European countries, including former states of the Soviet Union.  However, it remains lawful in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America.  Corporal punishment is also allowed in some military settings in a few jurisdictions.  There are campaigns against corporal punishment in several Western countries as well as internationally. These campaigns usually aim to bring about legal reform to ban the use of corporal punishment against minors by adults.

LivestreamFails,35if2n,glorkcakes,-4,Mon May 11 04:28:24 2015 UTC,"No need for hostility, friend! It's always a positive thing to question human behavior, especially when it comes to sensitive things such as a child's upbringing. Judging by your reaction you're sensitive to questioning your parents actions, and you feel that they were justified. That's quite a common occurrence and it's okay!   Well you don't see me showing up on these threads so I got to give them props haha   You take pride in how they raised you because you didn't turn up on a thread on reddit like this one?  I know quite a lot of people who do this and they all have issues with articulating disciplinary lessons vocally, and when they feel threatened (whether it's a threat to their pride/respect/etc) they respond with violence because they cannot formulate any other potential solution, and to me that is an admission of a lack of intelligence on their end. It's always good to carefully think about the repercussions of every action when disciplining, because respect can be broken just as quickly as it is built. Corporal punishment is a primitive disciplinary method that is used when no other solution can be formulated by the subject parent. Our evolutionary path (and also Human Rights Organizations) suggests that this method will eventually cease to exist due to our ability to critically process certain situations, and will be eventually banned as a common practice.   Sorry you felt the need to try to make an attempt at /r/iamsosmart[1] over something that was just a funny passing comment. Good luck in your future attempts!   Funny comments from your end though!"

Do you really think streamers make a full living off the generosity of kids?

You think if streamers didn't listen, entertain, and care about keeping their viewership they would be able to hold down work? Do you know how many failed streams there are?  The difference between a top streamer and a failed stream without viewership is the quality of content and the care of the streamer to actually GIVE the viewer the content they want to see.

LivestreamFails,35eai2,herkaburger,3,Tue May 12 19:47:38 2015 UTC,"Maybe its the wrong job for someone with a child and his wife doesn't want him to do it because she doesn't see it as a real job?

LivestreamFails,35eai2,Shizo211,6,Sun Jun 21 20:45:09 2015 UTC,"As someone who doesn't watch him, I am going to offer input based on what I know anyway:  This is based off the assumption he makes some kind of money streaming. If he doesn't, then I understand her frustration with him.  Does it seem like he is a bit immature, and that he says some really, really stupid shit? Yeah. He could work on some things, for sure. Does his wife seem kind of bitchy, and immature, and all that? Yes, she could use work as well.  Here's my biggest issue with the situation. Instead of sitting down, and talking it out, they do stupid passive aggressive things to annoy the other person. Talking behind closed doors about the person, only for the person to be listening, putting a crying kid in the others face and then saying ""you're a shit parent,"" ect. I don't know if she works, and I don't know if he has a different job, but if this guy's only income is his twitch account, then hell yeah, it's a job. You're being paid, that makes it a job.  She needs to respect the fact that, during streaming hours, that's him at work, and she need's to also respect that his PC is essentially his office, and she needs to just suck it up during that time and let him bring the whatever amount of money into their household (just like a real job. You don't drive a kid downtown to the guys office when it starts crying).   His issue is that he needs to grow the fuck up, address these issues, and stop talking to his wife like they are in High School and dating again, because that's stupid as fuck."
LivestreamFails,35eai2,herkaburger,2,Sun May 10 08:24:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's pretty obvious the relationship is fucked and they need counseling.  Based on the tenor of these two arguments alone, I'm pretty sure that streaming isn't the only thing they have these kinds of arguments about, so it's kind of pointless about whether or not its bringing in any income for them.  It's the relationship itself that's messed up.  That said, no, he doesn't make a significant amount of money streaming, so it's basically just recreation time for him.  That's worse than putting work ahead of your family but only slightly worse since most of the outcomes are the same.  It just reflects more poorly on him."

I don't know anything about him but it seems as if he simply plays video games from morning to evening and not spending time with his family. If he worked in a regular job he would work for 8-9hours and then be at home to spend time for the family and help out. So all he needs to talk to her and agree on a set schedule in which he won't be available to help her out and after that schedule he quits streaming and helps her with stuff. But I doubt that this is realistic for them."
LivestreamFails,35eai2,deathsquadwarrior420,0,Mon May 11 10:52:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean, it's not like streamers stream 24/7. There are plenty that are on a streaming schedule. If this guy has a schedule, and stops playing after, she has no room to really complain at him during his stream. If not, he's an asshole.  I guess, bottom line, we don't have enough info to really even judge what's going on here."
LivestreamFails,35eai2,ThechronoGamer,1 point,Mon May 11 10:57:36 2015 UTC,Maybe its the wrong job for someone with a child and his wife doesn't want him to do it because she doesn't see it as a real job?   It's not different than any office job it's even better because it's like permanent home office when having a kid.  If it does bring in enough (long term) income then there is no problem with it being a real job or not.  I think that the biggest issue is scheduling. I mean if he had a set schedule than it would be like any other job in which he wasn't at home (or atleast not available) for a certain amount of time but it seems that he simply plays all day longer than anyone who would work on their regular job would do so he doesn't have time for his family.
LivestreamFails,35eai2,SvaboBech,-2,Mon May 11 11:00:47 2015 UTC,"Why, because his wife is clearly home not working or off doing anything. She puts an infant in there while he's ""working"" and he can't do both. If he got another job what would that fix? He'd just be gone at work and she wouldn't be able to do this. Would he still be an asshole then for not helping? If that's your job, you can't just drop your job whenever. If the kid is sick or something sure, but there's no reason she, sitting at home not making money, can't watch the child while he makes money."

So he's not really being that loud, she comes in and ""whispers"" for him to be quiet, slams the door and the proceeds to yell at everything he says in the other room. He shouldn't have insulted her sure, but she was being a bit of a bitch.  If he's the one bringing in the money and this is the main source of income then why the fuck have they not tried to insulate the room to prevent being overly loud? Why does she feel the need to come in and scream at him instead of sending him a message on his phone for being too loud?  They are either both incredibly dense and childish or they are doing this shit on purpose so people can send the clip around on sites like this and get him more viewers."
LivestreamFails,35eai2,chrismartinherp,36,Sun May 10 07:35:02 2015 UTC,"There's clearly some residual anger between them two for her to flip out.  Anyone know how old the kid is? I stayed with my sister in law for a few days once a few months after they had the baby and I turned on the bathroom light which I didn't know also turned on the extractor. She flipped pretty instantly. She apologised in the morning but when you're tired, stressed, not getting any sleep and have a small human to monitor I can imagine you'd snap pretty quick.  Plus if his kid is trying to sleep at that time maybe he should move his streaming schedule? Maybe he shouldn't laugh at her and call her a stupid bitch when she asks him to quiet down.  Also men have really base-y voices that kind of carry even when whispering. So even if he was trying to be quiet its kind of hard. Plus him whispering isn't really entertaining for his viewers.  Really they should either change up his schedule times or get some sound proofing stuff for the room he streams in."

LivestreamFails,351tga,HoldenMyD,2,Wed May 6 16:24:35 2015 UTC,"Man I did exactly that once. It was a game where you can max out your character then you could reset and switch to a different faction with a few small bonuses.  My friends and I were playing together and planned to switch factions together, but I had maxed out more quickly than they had. So I was getting slightly impatient. I was screwing around on the character select screen (I don not remember why) and hit the right sequence of buttons to delete the character.  Long story short, I ended up power-grinding for like a week or so to get my character leveled back to max, while my friends all waited on me because they were nice.  I really don't get why they don't have an option to retrieve a character shortly after deletion or something, they may just underestimate user stupidity."
LivestreamFails,351tga,qwertpoi,7,Wed May 6 18:53:11 2015 UTC,That's why in MMO's they have you type the name of your character when you delete. I'm sure they can think of a way to do it with a controller.

LivestreamFails,351tga,Mutatiion,6,Wed May 6 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"Well, being dumb somewhat refers to being high, but since I smoke the exact same way when smoking the last tip of a rolled cigarette, I'm just saying it's entirely not certain he's smoking weed. Could be plausible, I'm just playing the devil's advocate. So, yes, Definitively realistic."
LivestreamFails,351tga,IrrationalDesign,9,Wed May 6 22:09:16 2015 UTC,What kind of progress and how much did he lose by doing this?

LivestreamFails,351tga,KAWAll,9,Thu May 7 03:19:06 2015 UTC,"Nope.  Saved over level 8 progress with level 3.    Of course, that also means that he lost the progress from level 3 to level 8."
LivestreamFails,351tga,TwinkyTheBear,1 point,Wed May 6 15:02:02 2015 UTC,He wrote over a lvl 8 save with the lvl 3 save.  So he lost about 3 hrs and 5 levels.

LivestreamFails,351tga,BeyondModern,59,Wed May 6 15:49:09 2015 UTC,4 hours in a Fallout game is generally the tutorial and a bit of exploration. An 100 hour+ save would be something to be upset about overwriting. At 4 hours the worst I'd say is 'Damn. Oh well'.
LivestreamFails,351tga,Brettshock,26,Wed May 6 15:50:00 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'd still be pissed about wasting 3 hours on a tutorial and exploration save IMO. I'd hate to have to replay that 3 hours immediately again."
LivestreamFails,351tga,BeyondModern,15,Wed May 6 15:52:47 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, no one likes wasting time, but at that point he's lost maybe 3% total completion of the game. Nothing to really flip out over when you're already devoting time to a game like Fallout."
LivestreamFails,351tga,Brettshock,10,Wed May 6 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"Also, he can probably breeze through those four hours if he played them recently enough to remember what happened.  A lot of time in Fallout is spent talking to other characters, and you can speed through the conversations if you remember what they said and what dialogue choices you picked."

I deleted a 36 hour save.  :(   Fortunately, I found someone's save file online that was on the exact mission I left off, so I didn't have to completely start over  :)    http://gtasnp.com/ in case anyone is wondering where to get GTA save files."

People keep playing the 'oooh he's drunk just let it go card"" but no, you can't let it go. He said it, address it. Disregarding something because he's slightly drunk won't solve a damn thing. You called out people who choose not to sub. He should be grateful he even got that sub button with the average viewers he gets. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. I lost A LOT of respect for duff.

LivestreamFails,34z4us,BigC23,5,Sat May 9 04:46:34 2015 UTC,it really is just the nature of the medium that he chose as his new job. if he could set up a paywall for his content it'd be career suicide

LivestreamFails,34z4us,Kony2012IsRelevant,19,Thu May 7 01:09:48 2015 UTC,"How can you say that? I see people say this about every youtuber/twitch streamer who has a bad reputation, it's completely mind boggling, ""he's actually a smart/nice guy"" seems to be the go to saying for people to legitimize the reason why it's okay for them to be watching trash."

I don't mind a sub or a donation alert to thank people and read off a message.  Being able to make a living off of it isn't some awful, disgusting thing.  It doesn't degrade their content completely.  But obsession with money isn't the way to go of course.  For example, licking your dog's ass for subs is pretty weak.  It just sounds like in a lot of cases people associate making a living off of it with being a greedy pile of crap.  Not you specifically, just from what I've seen.  But I do feel Twitch is going the Youtube route where everyone just tries to brand a perfect personality.  Just look at the two biggest categories on Youtube: vlogging and lets plays.  Heavily personality driven and it ends up being a game of ""lets see what we can talk about"" rather than ""lets see what we can create.""    But Pewdiepie, at least according to his AMA, really doesn't milk his status for money all that much."

LivestreamFails,34z4us,TheGutsyBat,2,Wed May 6 08:26:20 2015 UTC,If you stream League and get 500 viewers it will be harder to get a sub button versus someone streaming in the creative section to 200 viewers.  Also there are different people in charge of handing out sub buttons in different sections.
LivestreamFails,34z4us,TheGutsyBat,2,Wed May 6 12:05:13 2015 UTC,Definitely see that a lot from speed runners. Especially if they're playing niche games.
LivestreamFails,34z4us,BejitaMarius,1 point,Wed May 6 16:08:00 2015 UTC,Do you mean the 500 concurrent viewers thing?  When was that put into effect?  I've seen many a streamer pull in only 50-100 viewers per stream with sub buttons and all.
LivestreamFails,34z4us,TheGutsyBat,1 point,Thu May 7 01:03:48 2015 UTC,"It was put in effect at the beg of the year. The ones that were grandfathered in have the low view counts. But for now on, its quite difficult. Theres more then just the 500 view count you have to do to qualify."

LivestreamFails,34z4us,carlsmaxxed,13,Wed May 6 07:08:58 2015 UTC,So ad revenue just doesn't exist?
LivestreamFails,34z4us,glorkcakes,9,Wed May 6 07:33:24 2015 UTC,"It does exist, but it's really weak on Twitch, regardless, if you can't make enough money from doing this unless X amount of people sub and X amount of people donate, you probably shouldn't be doing it full time in the first place. Relying on others giving you/Twitch money is just pretty silly."

LivestreamFails,34z4us,CatSizedLymphNodes,10,Wed May 6 12:45:20 2015 UTC,"I stream and get on average 2-3k viewers, I've tried playing ads before and see no difference between that and not playing ads at all, and the amount I personally make from ads is a lot less than minimum wage. Not complaining, I don't rely on that to survive, but that's just my personal experience.  Ignoring that, those people that get 5k+ get 95%+ of their revenue from sub money/donations/sponsors, ad revenue is just a very, very small part regardless."

He's a genuine nice guy, he tries, he is entertaining and he just never rages at his chat. Someone is a dick in chat? He won't sit there and call them out ranting about it for a good 10 minutes like some streamers seem to do these days.  I think some streamers forget the fact that this is meant to be entertainment, not just for themselves but for us too and it's too bitchy these days. I personally only get 5 viewers on a good day and I'm happy to have those guys, they make my playing experience enjoyable and I hope they enjoy it too.

On top of that, when THEY accelerated the conversation they got all defensive when he started to get shoot-mad because, like many, he doesn't like people giving condescending advice. I'm sorry, but I have to deliberate that this was instigated by them. The part he lost me at was breaking the monitor, that's funny but I wouldn't want to be seen doing that."

Although this Zeke's guy might be a bit over the top and have anger management problems the people who he was talking with were douchebags. They were acting extremely condescending towards the fact that he wasn't as good as them. He accepted it and was frustrated that he couldn't complete these drifts or whatever. He said it takes time and practice. Then the girl and guy say no you don't need practice it's easy. Like. You're either oblivious, ignorant, or a complete asshole to say something like that."

LivestreamFails,34lnjy,EnmaDaiO,0,Mon May 4 04:55:27 2015 UTC,You take what i'm saying too literally. No shit it's easy to press a button to drift. This guy obviously was talking about drifting in a manner where you wouldn't hit walls. For ALOT of players who are new to racing games that can take some time to learn. You can't even deny that.
LivestreamFails,34lnjy,DudeWithTheNose,0,Mon May 4 06:55:17 2015 UTC,"That not true at all though. Mario kart is hardly a racing game, in the sense that the racing aspect is very simplified.   All you do is turn in the direction you want to go while holding the drift button."
LivestreamFails,34lnjy,cheesycoke,1 point,Thu May 7 20:57:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly, drifting is the most basic and necessary strategy in Mario Kart. All you really do need to do is hit one of the two right shoulder buttons while turning and sorta make some adjustments to do the turn properly. It's not like some pro Mario Kart move.  If they were fire hopping (hopping repeatedly to elongate a boost) and mocking him for not knowing how to do that, then it would be different. But all they were doing was trying to say that, with an easy maneuver, that he could actually start having fun playing Mario Kart."
LivestreamFails,34lnjy,BrapadooMan,2,Sun May 17 22:03:55 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes, I'll agree that the drifting wasn't all that hard to get a grasp on, but I also didn't have smug assholes throwing thinly veiled insults at me while I learned it. Anger always seems to make things really easy or really hard, and I'd imagine that learning game mechanics isn't the most approavhable task in a fit of rage."

LivestreamFails,34lnjy,Endaline,29,Sat May 2 10:44:48 2015 UTC,I think people misunderstand then. He's not mad because they are better than him. He is mad because they keep telling him how easy the game is when he obviously doesn't find it easy.  Chat does this constantly to streamers when they get stuck. They spam that is easy or say that they didn't find that section of the game hard. This is why he is saying that as streamers they should know better than to tell him it is easy.

Thats the reason I don't agree that just by being successful you're suddenly required to be a rolemodel for everyone. If anything streamers like this show that you don't have to cater to everyone and you don't have to be a highly skilled player to be a streamer.  I'm not a regular Zeke viewer, but from my understanding getting upset is something he does often and the people he plays with know that and if they hated him for it, they wouldn't be playing with him anyway. To me its kind of understandable that anger sometimes leads to taking it too far and in this case breaking a monitor, but so what? If he can afford to break monitors and/or other things its up to him. I don't see why anyone should condemn him as long as he isn't crossing the line by directing that violence on other people for example.  Your point about about gaming being something fun, making friends and enjoying is fine, but don't expect everyone to share your views. Many gamers are competitive for example and trying hard and then succeeding is what gives them the enjoyment."

He's not perfect, but you take the good and the bad.

I have a few friends who don't really play Mario Kart much and they struggled with learning how to drift and learning the courses at the same time. I don't know why they took out the choice of automatic drifting in Mario Kart 8. Not having to worry about drifting makes things so much easier for new players.

Twitch is literally through that partnership fase Youtube went through.  Before downvoting go to twitch and watch a stream. The lowbobs want more viewers to get a fancy subscribe button and the only thing you hear by the highly watched streams is only money related. Don't pretend it isn't an issue.

Is thanking people the clear cut line, or is it having a little animation showing a message?    We live in a for-profit world, literally your peanut butter is made by a company who's goal is to maximize the amount of profit they make.  By definition there is never ""enough.""

There are certain things that should be enforced at all times, like don't steal or hurt others, but to force the child to stay in bed all day because they're sick, well that's just totalitarianism. I suspect the child was a mistake which is why the mother resents him.  How was he being a douche about the situation? His mother was being a thundercunt and he calmly replied to her buffoonery that is yelling.  He clearly said in the video he was sleeping all day. Staying in bed all day is not good for you. The mother should have been giving him lots of liquids. The flu can dehydrate you very easily."

Why is him just laying there better for him than doing anything else?  It isn't as if sitting in the chair is much more difficult than laying in bed.  What if he was in bed with a controller?  The point of staying home isn't that you're so miserable that you can't function, it is to prevent yourself from spreading your sickness to other people."

After 17 hours of skilling and trying to drive up donations, the family came and they barely seemed to care that the dude (Joey) raised over $2000 for them. Additionally, the mother was a bit fat (to honestly put it lightly) and he had the Twitch chat up, so there was a bunch of people calling her obese/a land whale/etc in the Twitch chat and the father was reading the chat the whole time. Also, if you donated, a message came up on stream and people abused that too to call her fat and crack jokes. Eventually people found out that the father has a hard time getting a job because he committed some crimes (he didn't say what), and it went further downhill from there. The mods decided to ban people who were sending hate but it was a bit too late. It was a very awkward broadcast and the host, Joey, was visibly disappointed."

LivestreamFails,32i8y6,Icemasta,21,Tue Apr 14 19:13:19 2015 UTC,"That's really not true in all circumstances. $1 per 500 works out to $2000 per million.  Another figure that I've heard before $3000 per million, and so those are roughly in the same ballpark. But a lot of it has to do with providing decent content and convincing people to SIT THROUGH the ads, so you need a decent fan base for actual good content. If you reupload TV shows to YT and have random people watch them (assuming your monetization goes through), you're going to get like 1/10th the regular rate. Those viewers will be strangers, they have no link to you, they'll sit through way fewer ads, and might use adblock as well.   While this might be true for the guy we're talking about (since he has some YT subscribers), I've racked up a total view count of 250k views over a few months from random people, forums, and Reddit. For a typical medium sized YouTuber, this would generally be about $500-$700 dollars in ad revenue. I don't have a subscriber base, so I've got like $60 sitting in my Adsense account. It just goes to show how much having a fan base and meaningful content matters when you're monetizing."
LivestreamFails,32i8y6,Playsbadkennen,7,Tue Apr 14 20:11:07 2015 UTC,Barely. I have over 500k views monetized and only made around 500 bucks total.

Also why you shouldn't stream your desktop 101. If you only stream the games there's virtually no opportunity for this to happen. Put a splash up.  It's visible in the bottom right of the launcher for those that don't see it.
LivestreamFails,32i8y6,FunkTransmission,13,Tue Apr 14 00:45:24 2015 UTC,Steam has a thing where if you launch a game that requires a cd key it will show it in the overlay until you tick 'don't show me again.' It's a rookie mistake and something steam should honestly remove now that they also have an in-built streaming service.
LivestreamFails,32i8y6,distortednet,8,Tue Apr 14 06:41:24 2015 UTC,"Tis why i disable my overlays :D  also the built in steam streaming service won't render the overlay.  obs won't even render it, the only scenarios in which it does is when you use desktop/window capture or you're using a dual stream setup where the entire desktop is captured over a capture card.  still, it would be nice for stream to figure out a better way."

Ended up getting the tv paid for by donators.  Edit: In trying to find the original discussion I mentioned, I also ran into this post that seems much more believable, given his mute reaction (dude will nuke an animal shelter and a maternity ward if someone beats him in any game, no way he's this calm over the TV)."

If you saw the damage you'd know it was unplayable.  2) He didn't ask for donations. This was long before live streaming was an e-begging session and long before he had money issues."

Fourth of July AND July Fourth are also common ways of saying the name of the holiday. Secondly, if you're going with the Fourth of July route here (implying that its the exception or breaks the rules or whatever the fuck you're going on about), that doesn't really work for your argument either. The Fourth of July is a holiday (Independence Day) that occurs on July 4th. Problem solved. This pedantry really just needs to stop."
LivestreamFails,3295sp,LyricalMURDER,0,Thu Apr 30 05:28:39 2015 UTC,"I think the US way is retarded, but in this case ""Fourth of July"" is correct in US format. It's a name of holiday, not date, and thus is ruled by different naming scheme."

This mentality that says ""everyone has to get a job and pay everything for themselfes"" denies free healthcare. It is not a direct thing, but i see the strings.   -> People even shame each other for not getting a degree like seen here. This is not the case in the EU on that scale.  We in Germany for instance have better statuory health insurance than NA and also people dont have to get a degree to get a good job as much as in NA. Well, the NA mentality has sadly swapped to us too recently. But i can enjoy studying for 280 bucks a semester on non-private universities."

I made a living selling weed for a few years. Was that a career?"
LivestreamFails,329psl,Dynamiklol,15,Sun Apr 12 01:46:39 2015 UTC,"As long as streaming is relevant, you can have a career in it as long as you stick to what you know.  Some people get burnt out or fuck themselves with controversy but others that just stick to gaming and producing content can have lasting success, it's the same as YouTube personalities that have thrived for years.  The pool of people currently doing this is incredibly small, but not impossible. Lethalfrag has turned it into a career, putting in 40 hours a week streaming games/pinball and makes more money than he did as a chef. Sodapoppin makes an absurd amount of money just playing games, his friend Nick makes YouTube videos and highlights and that's now another revenue stream.   It's an entertainment job, it'll last as long as anything else in entertainment."
LivestreamFails,329psl,EnmaDaiO,-20,Sun Apr 12 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"Very good points. Unfortunately, for every 1 sodapoppin, there are probably 200 unemployed 20+ year olds still living with their parents, claiming to be streaming as a career. Just makes it all seem like a big joke."
LivestreamFails,329psl,evilchefwariobatali,6,Sun Apr 12 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"None of those people are claiming that their current career is streaming.   You're absolutely right that for every 1 successful streamer there's 200 new/struggling streamers, but that's because they haven't gotten established yet. You have to put a LOT of hours and work into your stream to get to the point to make it successful enough to support yourself, even if you're living in your parents basement.  You have to set a schedule, find games you can stream for hours and hours and hours, get your name out there and make friends who will spread the work, get partnered, get sponsored if you're looking for something extra, branching into YouTube is also a factor.   If you're diligent, streaming can be the exact same as any other job."
LivestreamFails,329psl,EnmaDaiO,8,Sun Apr 12 03:50:59 2015 UTC,That's a very ignorant statement... You could say that for anything really. How many people are in the NBA? And how many people who have been playing basketball for their whole lives are not in the NBA and can't make a living through the NBA? Is the NBA a big joke because of that?
LivestreamFails,329psl,evilchefwariobatali,-9,Sun Apr 12 02:49:39 2015 UTC,NBA players aren't payed off their fans donations.
LivestreamFails,329psl,EnmaDaiO,5,Sun Apr 12 04:10:47 2015 UTC,I mean you could technically call fans paying for merchandise the same thing as donations? It's all entertainment and these entertainers get payed in different ways. For streaming they're receiving direct payment for the entertainment they put up on a daily basis. For basketball players they're being payed by the organization who collects all it's revenue from fans buying merchandise. There really is no difference. ALSO: Fans pay to see the NBA games. That's where alot of their money comes from. It's literally the same thing but in different form.
LivestreamFails,329psl,RobintheLarge,-11,Sun Apr 12 04:35:35 2015 UTC,I get what you're trying  to say but you are comparing two things that  just aren't the same.
LivestreamFails,329psl,Endaline,5,Sun Apr 12 04:37:54 2015 UTC,Right and how is it not the same? The entertainment industry is pretty much the same. You're just distributing moneys in different ways to support the entertainers. Tell me then. By condemning streamers then you're basically saying streaming shouldn't exist. You do realize that? Youtubers are also all people who don't have careers.
LivestreamFails,329psl,EnmaDaiO,0,Sun Apr 12 04:42:39 2015 UTC,Streaming is becoming like TV more and more. It's absolutely possible to get a great career out of it. Look at The Young Turks on Youtube. It's a full size news station like you would see on TV but on the internet broadcasting live.  You guys can downvote and deny all you want. Sure internet is not yet as stable as original broadcasting but it will be there and for some people it is here already.
LivestreamFails,329psl,spikeforlife,12,Sun Apr 12 17:23:25 2015 UTC,"How is it not an actual career? They are entertainers same as radio show hosts, movie stars, musicians, etc. Most of them are a lot more small scale than that but they are still entertainers.   If a lot of people reliably make a living from something I would argue it is a legitimate career."
LivestreamFails,329psl,geihrg_throwaway,7,Sun Apr 12 01:14:55 2015 UTC,"I'm actually confused too. Streaming is entertainment. It's in the entertainment industry. It is a legitimate career. Like you said, it's exactly the same thing as watching sports, or watching T.V. I guess you're saying all those channels and products from the media aren't considered a real career as well. EDIT: Honestly seems like this guy is just jelly people are making a living through something they're passionate about and have fun doing. Also, that person at the top left of the video hardly represents the streaming community. Does the streaming community have a problem? Yeah it does. This guy is a part of that problem. In fact, that guy at the top left is despicable and I can't believe there are people who support his behavior. But anyways that's not how all streamers are."

I honestly don't give a fuck whatever (legally) you want to do on stream and whatever kind of audience you get, great.

LivestreamFails,325zs2,i34773,14,Sat Apr 11 11:13:09 2015 UTC,I also don't find it to be really a fail considering they know exactly what they're doing. I mean going to a casino and gambling is a fail then with the same mindset. My .02

Not so much."

LivestreamFails,325zs2,Patentlyy,3,Sat Apr 11 16:59:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm definitely sick of these. It's not really a fail anyway. If you count gambling as gaming - the game is working exactly as intended. No matter how much you bet, there's always a chance you will lose, and they are aware of that when they bet their skins. So what's the fail? You can argue that participating in this ""game"" is in itself a fail, but that doesn't mean we should have tons of posts of people gambling and losing. That's just a part of gambling - sometimes you lose big, sometimes you win big. There's no fail here."

LivestreamFails,325zs2,__author__,3,Sun Apr 19 01:24:14 2015 UTC,"Can someone explain CS:GO and its money system? It's marked as dollars, but surely the amounts aren't real money...?"
LivestreamFails,325zs2,Raven_of_Blades,3,Sat Apr 11 16:07:11 2015 UTC,The money systems uses real money and the amounts are real as well. You can buy and sell skins in the steam market which will add money to your steam wallet. You can also sell your skins via. Paypal which is pretty risky or use ebay.  Steam market gives 20% to Steam with every transaction so skins are usually a little cheaper when sold out of the steam market or traded.
LivestreamFails,325zs2,SumThinChewy,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:20:23 2015 UTC,"How do you obtain stuff that you can sell for such high prices? Is it all luck based? I mean, you could basically make a living off of this game."
LivestreamFails,325zs2,flawlessbrown,4,Sat Apr 11 16:23:01 2015 UTC,"There are a few ways to get skins.     At the end of the game After every finished game you get the chance to get a random drop which is either a skin (mostly 0,03-0,10$) with a really really low chance to get something that's worth a lot or a weapon case. I think there is a maximum drop amount per week. Opening weapon cases As just described you can get weapon cases from playing or buy them from the market (0,03cent - 1$) - if there is a new case released it's usually worth a lot more in the first week of the update. To open a case you need to buy a case key which is 2,29€ (don't know the exact $ price). When opening a case you have a random chance to get a really bad skin ~0,10$ or to get a really high skin up to 1000$. I guess I don't have to say that you mostly get the 0,10$ ones. Just to give you an example. I've opened ~400 cases ingame and the best skin I got was ~30$. Of course you can get lucky and make a winning out of it but it's really rare that people actually have that much luck. Betting and Gambling There are various inofficial sites where you can bet on professional competetive matches or just gamble. The more you put in, the higher the chance/amount you'll win. Easy system, high risk. Trading You can also try to trade your skins for better ones and make a winning out of that. This takes a lot of time and the win is usually pretty low.    Making a living out of this games items is pretty unrealistic. Most of the people owning high tier skins put a huge amount of money in time in the game. There's of course also people who get gifted skins or keys by others. For example streamers, youtubers or professional players with a huge fanbase."
LivestreamFails,325zs2,Zelmont,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"That's interesting, thanks. So all these multi-thousand dollar bets that I keep seeing are just people who got incredibly lucky multiple times and/or have made playing the game basically they're job.   Does skill play any part in what kind of a drop you get in the end of a game? Like if you got more points/kills, or play at a higher tier, can you have a better chance at more expensive stuff?   You also say ""unofficial sites"", but is it actually something punishable (or illegal) from the game's perspective, like botting? Or is it just something that's not official supported, but Valve doesn't care that it happens?"
LivestreamFails,325zs2,fatalxmts,3,Sat Apr 11 16:41:21 2015 UTC,"Most of the items you get after a game aren't worth more than a few cents and skill has nothing to do with it. All of the expensive items except for a few very rare exceptions are from opening cases.   Also valve doesn't do anything about the sites, but recently banned one of the gambling site's bots for having scammed items. Because people would scam items then dump them into the sites to try to not get banned."
LivestreamFails,325zs2,RecycledSatan,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:33:44 2015 UTC,So could that guy of just like... easily turned those items into money and have like 6 grand in his steam wallet instead of gambling them?
LivestreamFails,325zs2,Amberg22,2,Mon Apr 13 08:56:28 2015 UTC,"Well not easily, the Steam Market price cap is $400 USD and almost every item he put in is worth much more than that. And to get real money he'd to sell through PayPal or something which is risky as fuck. So yes he could have technically, but trying to sell these for real money is basicly the same risk as what he did with them"

On average, such a bet would result in a net loss of $255.24  Would you place a bet knowing that you're more likely to lose money, than you are to gain it?"

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Lepke,5,Tue Apr 7 00:53:51 2015 UTC,"It's economics and risk management.   Expected value = (Probability of success)(Payoff of success) + (Probability of failure)(Payoff of failure)  In this circumstance, the expected value of his bet was lower than the bet he made.

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,TheCyanKnight,1 point,Tue Apr 7 05:00:14 2015 UTC,"While true, it's the same situation of gambling in a casino. Putting all your money in for a high risk high reward outcome such as this and the reaction of devastation would be the same in both situations."

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,TheCyanKnight,-6,Wed Apr 8 12:59:06 2015 UTC,Because he lost $5100 lol. How can you NOT see why he's pissed?  Just because there's a chance to lose doesn't mean you won't be pissed if you do lose. He also had a chance to win. It's not like it was  a 99% chance of him losing.
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,adamkex,8,Mon Apr 6 23:11:44 2015 UTC,"That bet wasn't even ""high reward"" though. If you took into account probability and the expected return, you'd find that 2/3rd of the time you would gain $2154.31, while 1/3rd of the time you're going to lose $5099.  On average you would expect him to lose $255.24. Not really the smartest decision to make.  Edit: I like how people are down voting this because I've pointed out that it was a stupid bet to make. It's basic probability. If he were to make the same bet multiple times, it would more than likely result in a net loss."

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,TweetsInCommentsBot,101,Mon Apr 6 19:46:53 2015 UTC,"This doesn't surprise me in the least. Sodapoppin recently went on Twitter bragging about gambling literally $6000/USD (donation money) in a matter of hours and losing it.  I find it somewhat ironic that someone who 3 years ago was asking for donations to help with medical bills due to someone in his family being ill, is now a guy who is now a home owner, numerous cars, makes easily 6 figures and gambles/brags about losing 6grand in a matter of hours.  https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/567897587937734656  https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/568070491111452673  Recently on April 4th he mentioned going to Casino again. (I just opened his Twitter page and found this in 2 minutes) no I don't follow him nor do I watch/sub to his stream anymore. (2 years ago I'd be lying).  https://twitter.com/Sodapoppintv/status/584564628069285888  Sad to see these streamers acting like these donations supports them in the sense of paying food/gas/electricity/health/investment in the stream.  But they're pretty much funding a 21 year old kids gambling addiction, who already alone from his Twitch/YT/Sub revenue makes more in 1 year than most people will earn with Bachelor degrees in their lives in that time span of 1 year.  Don't get me wrong though, this isn't a ""LETS BASH SODAPOPPIN"" clearly he worked hard and developed that following to be put in the position to receive such a huge income. He's a talented individual and lets not take that away from him, he knew his audience and managed to make it grow from 50-120 viewers streaming 2v2 on Arena Tournament (WOTLK Private Server) to averaging 20k concurrent viewers.   tl;dr Money changes people.  Edit: For whatever reason my spacing got messed up."

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,ilovetoeatpoutine,17,Tue Apr 7 07:23:17 2015 UTC,"This should be top comment. This is why I cant watch a lot of streamers. It's not envy at all.  I've talked to viewers on list of ""top 5 donations"" and quite a few of them are living in their parents house and have no/shit job, and debt, and they still got hundreds of dollars.   To have a donation message that makes a sound, interrupts gameplay, allows a global message to be played, a high score list. It's pretty much gambling exploitation. Most of the twitch population is zombified like this and do not even realize it. These streamers are making tens of thousands of dollars a month off of you, they don't need your $10 donation.  They have made the word ""donation"" sound very ugly."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,jrr6415sun,13,Mon Apr 6 23:40:17 2015 UTC,"That's why I love streamers like LethalFrag, he doesn't have a sub notification and doesnt have an annoying donation pop up either. He cares about streaming and putting on a quality show. He has said that he stopped looking at numbers (viewers/followers/subs) because that just made him want to do dumb things that would make the stream lower quality but potentially bring in more viewers.  It's the same with kripp, even though his chat is cancer he doesnt have shitty pop ups that distract from gameplay."

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Foldafolda,-2,Mon Apr 13 22:36:52 2015 UTC,It's different having a 5 second animation/loud sound combo that distracts than the guy just noticing the sub notification by twitch in chat and saying hello.

Sub chat is a preference, he likes talking to chat and that's practically impossible when you have 1000+ viewers so sub chat works out fine.  I don't know what your last paragraph has to do with anything. Maybe you have a personal problem with him or streaming in general but him having a child is irrelevant imho, streaming for someone like him and most big streamers is no different from having a job and needing to put in certain hours to pay the bills."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Dyqo,4,Wed Apr 8 21:44:18 2015 UTC,"Sad to see these streamers acting like these donations supports them in the sense of paying food/gas/electricity/health/investment in the stream.   It was always the ""support what i do"" kinda reason for me. Streamers don't tell you what they'll do with that money but you can already guess what they'll do with it if you watch for like one hour. You immediately realize what kind of person the streamer is (Soda got a new keyboard a few days ago and he presented his old one on camera - it was probably the most disgusting thing I've seen in recent times. That thing had frickin spiderwebs or giant dust stains all over it. It looked like that thing was rotting in an attic somewhere for like 10 years.) So you can bet your ass that a young community college dropout like Soda's going to throw that money out of the window. At least he's honest about it though and not another ZilianOP."

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,ShammyWoWLoL,-1,Tue Apr 7 01:04:06 2015 UTC,"Mind you, the stream that he did for his family wasn't his direct family. It was a charity stream that he was asked to do by his immediate family for his relative who was dying, and they wanted to live for a few more years.  I can assure you that the money did go to their care, but no followup has been talked about on how the relative is doing.  Sodapoppin doesn't ask for Tips, people just happen to give him them. Even during his charity stream for his relative, he never asked, people just want to be generous and help out."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,HandOfBl00d,2,Tue Apr 7 01:07:57 2015 UTC,Dude will you ever stream again ? at least on hitbox if you can on twitch anymore :(
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,ShammyWoWLoL,2,Tue Apr 7 17:12:08 2015 UTC,"I think you're absolutely missing the point. Helping promote a charity/relative with a terminal illness and asking for money is a completely different game than going on Twitter and bragging about gambling $6000 USD.   Money and fame has clearly blown his ego out of whack but I don't blame him. When he has hundreds of thousands of people supporting his actions/ego and throwing money at him why should he stop? It's just a self circle jerking toxic environment.   Also let's not forget how much people change in a few years, he started streaming at what 16/17 and is now 21? I'm 20 right now and the difference 4-5 years can make is extreme. (With or without the streaming/fanbase/6 figure income variable,  I'd imagine that only helped make it more extreme.)"
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Elfking88,20,Tue Apr 7 18:57:51 2015 UTC,"I remember a couple years ago he pulled a bunch of donations in one night and was literally crying on stream, he might have been hamming it up a bit for the camera but it seemed genuine to me at the time and I was very glad to see him get some money. That was back when he was in his little apartment and was still with Mary.  Now he's throwing away 5k like it's nothing? This coupled with the fact that his stream has turned to complete shit lately has left me incredibly disappointed with the guy, I want old Phantoml0rd back.  And his old girlfriend wasn't nearly annoying as this one. ""JAMES OH MAH GAWD JAAAAMES"""
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,ShammyWoWLoL,9,Tue Apr 7 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"I'm sure that night was genuine to him. Prior to that his life experience was working at Best Buy making maybe at best $12/hr+commission or something?   Now he's used to having thousands of dollars thrown at him daily. I think slowly neurologically his brain got rewired and this is what we see today. Sodapoppin used to be really grateful/cheap with his money. He literally skipped meals on stream to ""save money"" when he was in College.  Now in a matter of hours he's blowing thousands of dollars on casinos. I'm guessing Phantom is experiencing the same change."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Sheepolution,2,Wed Apr 8 15:41:52 2015 UTC,It's sad but it's what happens when someone suddenly gets access to a lot of money and are not used to dealing with it. It doesn't take a lot to go to someones head.
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,JuanCarlosI,1 point,Tue Apr 7 21:16:48 2015 UTC,You're absolutely right. Just look at all those tragic stories about people who won the lottery and how it literally destroyed peoples lives/families.   Look at NFL athletes who went from nobodies to multi-millionares in a few years. As soon as an injury puts them out and they don't get those pretty 7/8 figure NFL contracts they all go broke/bankrupt.  Mike Tyson is another example of a man who went from a nobody to  having a net worth of 250 million at one point. He burned through his money like nothing and if you watch his recent Howard Stern interviews he'll tell you how he literally gave away cars to get out of a traffic ticket.

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Dert_,2,Tue Apr 7 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"I just kinda wish he'd lose the viewers. The things he's doing now are pretty bizarre.  He licked a dogs ass a few days ago for 10$ (then wrote it on twitter to get attention for the stream.) https://twitter.com/PhantomL0rd/status/590208430675271680  The shock collar thing was VERY bizarre, why the fuck would you do that? he doesn't even need to do it!   I don't honestly care about the CSGO shit, the betting and rampant case openings. I didn't even watch him before because he was good at league. There was a certain meta of mages that got him high-ish in the ladder. But, it was the way he reacted to things in the game, reacting with the chat who would troll him [kinda like Sodapoppin's chat I guess.] that made him entertaining. A personality.   It's completely gone now, I'm not going to say ""It's since he met Dingle and they seem to be finding ways to get the most money"" 'cause that's too easy to say. But the personality he once had is just vanished."

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,MacFatty,5,Tue Apr 7 20:34:18 2015 UTC,"I have grown to absolutely despise twitch.  It's so filled with moneywhoring and bullshit, it's disgusting.  You got people living in their parents basement making less than minimum wage, throwing the few hundred dollars they have saved up towards their favorite twitch streamer that doesn't even need it, just so they can feel special for 3 seconds when the ""donation"" notification pops up.  Are they willingly donating, with their own free will? sure. Are they being manipulated into doing it? Kind of."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,vcc0m,4,Thu Apr 9 09:22:19 2015 UTC,He makes that amount of money every 3rd day so it's no big deal for him D:
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,MacFatty,12,Sun Apr 12 09:53:52 2015 UTC,He earns over half a million a year..?
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Temil,17,Sat Apr 25 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"https://i.imgur.com/OLyQNpk.png Forsen is a big streamer, far as I know. He accidentally shared this back in December the 17th. (date bottom right on the bar). This we can assume is 17 days worth of donations, not counting what he earns from subscriptions and ads."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,MacFatty,20,Sat Apr 25 19:44:25 2015 UTC,And these big streamers make you believe they're leading a rough life in which at every second they're in danger of becoming homeless.
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Temil,4,Wed Apr 15 23:43:16 2015 UTC,Ha-Ha. They earn more than a lot of bachelor-degrees net you.
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,m4hleon,15,Mon Apr 6 19:26:06 2015 UTC,"If we take forsen's screenshot, that's $1100 dollars, PER DAY.  That's not more than a lot of bachelor's, that's more than any starting salary at any job you're going to get for going to a school.  And unless he does something colossally stupid like show his dick on stream, or lie to people about being disabled for donations, he will probably continue to receive that level on donations for a really long time."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,zeppelin123,4,Mon Apr 6 19:30:52 2015 UTC,"Yep. If he pulls an average of $20k a month in donations, he is looking at at least $240k a year. And again, that is not counting ad revenue he gets, and all the subscribers. (They pay $4.99 a month and far as I know, half of that goes towards the streamer, and some streamers have 2-4000 subs. That is an additional $6-10k.)"
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,LenfaL,2,Mon Apr 6 20:17:01 2015 UTC,I think the thing to keep in mind is that the people that are making this amount of money streaming are in the minority by FAR. There are  probably only like 20 streamers in the world with the viewerbase the size of this guy.
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Temil,6,Mon Apr 6 22:22:28 2015 UTC,"Forsen is small time compared to Lirik who just hit 10k subs. 10k subs is equal to $25k and that's monthly. Add in donations/sponsors/ad revenue and you're looking at over a million for the year, easy."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,mwmwmwmwmmdw,3,Mon Apr 6 23:09:37 2015 UTC,"Yep, and lirik is selling a tshirt right now too. With 5k+ sold he's probably going to net ~$100k on tshirt sales alone, I think I've heard him say he's planning on doing a few shirts (3-4?) per year. I wouldn't be surprised if lirik is around a million/yr, very likely to be over it (pre tax).  And with an other big name streamer, summit, no doubt he has tons of subs (several thousand) but watch the donations pour in. He probably gets a $3 donation every 10s.  Big streamers like these guys are also able to negotiate better rates on subs. By default it's 50-50 and I think the split goes in favor of the streamer as the sub count hits certain milestones. So they could be getting 65-35 on subs. I think they also get better rates on ads if they run them."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,LenfaL,1 point,Mon Apr 6 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"I see 16 millions total views on the Forsen guy channel. If this can be indirectly correlated to revenue, then quite a few streamers get these numbers. There are probably over a hundred of them, not that rare really."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Temil,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:04:53 2015 UTC,That's still 100 people IN THE WORLD.  That's less than 1 in 70 million.
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,mwmwmwmwmmdw,2,Tue Apr 7 04:06:54 2015 UTC,yes but that bachelors degree will always be something valid on your resume. how much weight is being a twitch streamer worth if they ever need to get a real job?
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Temil,3,Tue Apr 7 05:08:28 2015 UTC,"I don't have any knowledge on this, but I would assume it would be a marketable experience in the entertainment industry, and maybe in advertising, business, public relations, etc. They could also go back to school, or just go for a regular low-end job, which isn't the end of the world. Most streamers weren't headed for a bright future before streaming anyways."

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,McRawffles,2,Wed Apr 15 02:20:34 2015 UTC,lets say they make 500k a year for 5 years. thats 2.5 millions which could be enough but considering these people are barely 20 it wont last a lifetime
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,MacFatty,3,Wed Apr 15 03:03:30 2015 UTC,2.5 Million is plenty enough to make money by investing it in property or whatever.  These people should be able to be smart enough to not go hungry after making this much.
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,NeoDestiny,1 point,Tue Apr 7 11:10:55 2015 UTC,There was a day where Forsen got $11750 from one donator. And then his other top donator also donated a couple hundred or thousand just to keep his top donator spot. I wouldn't be surprised if his last months income was above $50k
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,eggman198,4,Wed Apr 15 02:23:40 2015 UTC,Even assuming that's a full month (30 days) for Forsen that's a ton.   Also Forsen only has 1/4 as many followers as Phantom.

LivestreamFails,31nrtw,McRawffles,-3,Tue Apr 7 18:28:29 2015 UTC,i wish i could make the money you guys make at your ages i just hope the bubble doesn't burst because im not sure twitch stream looks good on a resume
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Bluedidit,20,Mon Apr 6 21:35:28 2015 UTC,"How about ""project lead of website that served over 1mil pageviews per month, manager/organizer of several personal sponsorships, including advertising of and communication with said sponsors, manager of social outreach (twitter, facebook, reddit) that dwarfs the size of some small companies, and individual manger/head of PR for said entity operating everything above""?  It's all about how you market yourself."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,Easily_lmpressed,2,Thu Apr 9 14:47:20 2015 UTC,"That's not the definition of a bubble.  A bubble is over-inflated asset prices relative to intrinsic values which will correct itself (crash).  Live streaming isn't an asset to start with, and it is not going to disappear because it basically offers interactivity with celebrities/top athletes, something which professional sport doesn't offer.  That said, most people never become famous, and if you never become famous, you have relatively little on your resume.  There's also a lot of variance involved because nobody knows the next big game.  People would have never guessed during Starcraft's (both of them) heyday that hey would be where they are now."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,CloakyTengu,11,Tue Apr 7 11:12:09 2015 UTC,"Probably not but guys with half his followers earn 6 figures.

I would not be surprised if I heard he was making upwards of 300k a year and that the vast majority of those skins he gambled were ones he either won through gambling or were donated."
LivestreamFails,31nrtw,eggsfried,-3,Tue Apr 7 11:25:58 2015 UTC,People give him a lot of skins and from what I can gather he does a lot of trade ups for Dragon lores (which can cost over 500 at a time).

LivestreamFails,30vdvq,xzer,8,Tue Mar 31 06:10:59 2015 UTC,Yeah some of them are pretty fucken good because they can instantly react and will always cast the best spell in any situation. AFAIK humans still move but the rotation is done completely by the bot.  Some people also do the same with raids but they're harder to spot.
LivestreamFails,30vdvq,xNervus,4,Tue Mar 31 09:34:44 2015 UTC,"I used honorbuddy during WoTLK, after that I quit the game, and only used it for a few months when I've hit a point where I could no longer stomach leveling/farming. (I played since vanilla, I had several level 70's all leveled by hand)  The bot might be a little retarded, but if you didn't put delays on him, he would instantly interrupt and do full rotations on mobs burning all cooldowns, sometimes a poor guy would jump on my bot to try and kill me and he would get crushed by this perfect rotation killing machine. (I never afk'ed, had dual monitor, and would watch a film while making sure the bot would get stuck)  If you can put the rotation on the bot and disable movement, you have a perfect slaughter house right there, no need for skill, easy 2k arena rating for sure."

Sure there would be an occasional terrible ass person that would fail against the chained combo while back peddling and turning slow as fuck.   I arena'd from S3-S7 think my highest was only like 2050. Unless ratings have changed since then (2k was decently high, top people were close to 3k) There is no way in hell that you could use that shit to even get above 1800. Let alone break 1600.   It was retarded and just used as a last ditch effort to not look completely afk, you'd just look like a terrible PvE player. Maybe if you ran some ultra burst combo, (I have no idea what arenas is like now, I quit at the end of WoTLK) I couldn't see anyone getting past 1600. Also did they even have profiles set up for arenas? Then again that bot was really legit and I'm sure they've probably added a lot of features to it. So I could be totally fucking wrong but I'm just interested."

LivestreamFails,30vdvq,faustus666,6,Tue Mar 31 05:01:52 2015 UTC,"Cryptocurrencies are mined by basically abusing the fuck out of your computer hardware.  So someone using your computer to mine crypto for you will quickly overheat, if not kill, either your CPU or GPU, if not both, while also sending your power bill through the roof. And to top it off, they earn a bit of money off killing your computer for you.  Mining cryptocurrency even intentionally, when you're pocketing the magical internet funbux for yourself, is ""negative EV""- basically a fancy term for ""it loses you money more often than it earns you money, though it has a chance to earn you money if you're lucky"". However, that chance is astronomically low, so you basically just always lose money even though you're earning funbux. Now when you aren't earning the funbux, then it's even worse, and you're just killing your computer for no reason.  Having a crypto miner on your computer is bad news."

LivestreamFails,308t3w,wanilob,8,Wed Mar 25 21:34:35 2015 UTC,Depends what you mean by normal. Everything that was intended to be completed is completed. But the strats are very optimized and the movement difficult. It's far from a let's play if that's what you mean.
LivestreamFails,308t3w,SulliverVittles,1 point,Wed Mar 25 18:42:37 2015 UTC,"Oh I'm sure there's a ton of optimization and strats and all that, and I don't mean to diminish the difficulty of this type of run. It's just that when I hear the phrase ""glitchless any%"" I imagine two kids racing against each other to beat the game before the other does without doing anything different than a normal playthrough would require.   I'm biased of course because the runners that I watch are Cosmo and Sinister1 and such, so I'm used to glitches and all that shit."

LivestreamFails,300kfz,gazwel,1 point,Tue Mar 24 16:35:42 2015 UTC,"I'm just now stumbling upon this thread and I wanted to give a better answer.  My inventory in CSGO is decently sized, about $1300 total, highest I've been is probably $2500.  I bet on pro games, sometimes I even put low value stuff I win on websites like the one from this vid or equally stupid gambling sites and yes, I spent a decent amount of money early on when skins were first introduced.  With that being said it's about the only game I play now, and from one bet on csgolounge I can often finance buying some other game I may want, as seldom as it may be (most recent was GTAV and occasionally buying some cheap DLC for Payday 2).  So looking at before I played CSGO, buying a game or two every moth at $40-60 and putting maybe 20-30 hours into each compared to having spent $600 on steam market on CSGO, having an inventory worth twice that and 2300 hours played in the game it doesn't bother me.  Before I got into CS, I would think it crazy I would own $1000+ of virtual items for a video game and would finance other game purchases with it, now it kind of makes sense.  Looking at inventories of my friends as well, most people with high inventory values on my friends list either never play other games, have played CS for 10+ years and will likely never stop or are really good at betting skins."

Third party companies use these skins as gambling, some use them to bet on pro matches, this website is a jackpot system.

LivestreamFails,300kfz,MrCoops,15,Mon Mar 23 17:16:40 2015 UTC,Basically what you do is you put skins in the pot and depending of the value of the skins you put in you get a certain probabilty you will win the pot. So lets say the pot is worth 500 dollars and you put in 250 dollars you get a 50 percent chance of winning the pot. When there is 50 skins in the pot minimum it chooses a player randomly.
LivestreamFails,300kfz,jsquareddddd,9,Mon Mar 23 17:43:24 2015 UTC,"The way the jackpot system works is it pulls a winner after 50 skins are put into it, then moves on to a new one."

The more money you put in the more tickets you get. A random ticket is then pulled, whoever owns this ticket gets the jackpot.  So the people who put in more money have a higher chance Of winning, but also are risking more to get a lower return on their risk.  Those that put in a small value of skins have a much lower chance of winning, but if they do they get a much larger return on what they risk.

LivestreamFails,2zotqh,coffeediarrea,8,Fri Mar 20 16:46:31 2015 UTC,"Even if it was a scam attempt (which i think its not) he still should check the trade properly, clicking next trade > next trade > next trade within seconds of eachother you beg people to send trades like this. It's still his own fault, it's not a scam if he can say no to it and walk away with all his items.   And to take it even further, this isn't the first time it happens either, he did exactly this once before (which i linked in my edit) so he clearly doesnt learn from experience, so i dont feel sorry for him what so ever. Don't do trades like this if you sometimes ""give"" away items, or slow down when you trade. It's nobodys fault but his own.  And if it was a scam, the guy sending the trade wouldnt give the items back to him.  There's nothing really to discuss here, he is a moron trading like a moron and this is what happens, when you do the same mistake again with high-value items i feel he should be ""scammed"" and not get his items back, so maybe he doesn't do it anymore, he got the items back both times and didnt deserve it."
LivestreamFails,2zotqh,Lasti,-7,Sat Mar 21 06:16:56 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that this guy isn't a moron and a total idiot for not checking anything but that still doesn't justify this kind of trade behavior. It's not giving someone the right to do something like that towards anyone. You wouldn't take advantage of a mentally challenged person on the street like that because he doesn't know any better.   If he did this stuff to other people as well - sure take all his items from him,  I don't care and he deserved it.  It's kind of a bad joke however if the guy who did it is a moderator in his channel and only did it to scare him (or got so much shit from anyone that he decided to give it back)."

That's like signing a TOS that says you are going to fork over your next 5 paychecks to the company that you signed a 34171 page TOS with.  That's scamming, and if someone disagrees with you/me, they're still downvoting you incorrectly.  inb4 ""but shady TOS documents won't hold up in court"" --- That is completely beside the point here.  A scam attempt is a scam attempt."
LivestreamFails,2zotqh,Lasti,3,Mon Mar 23 23:16:14 2015 UTC,As far as i can tell everybody who's saying that this is a clear scam attempt got down voted so far for basically defending the streamer (or they actually think that this is an OK method to do trades) - which means (for me at least) that there are some really shitty people in here who can't even see where the true problem lies. This whole topic is a lost cause in here. I'm on Reddit long enough to realize that.   It's just strange that anybody just bashes the streamer for making the mistake but completely disregards the method of trade-offering here.
LivestreamFails,2zotqh,H_L_Mencken,2,Mon Mar 23 23:33:26 2015 UTC,"I'd rather just say scam, at the end of the day, they are looking to reep LARGE benefits from me, to me it is a scam, even if it does depend on me being an idiot.   What? I'm not sure that you understand what a scam is.    Yeah, it's my own fault, but what do you want me to say? ""Oh, I got the skin back from that dude who TRICKED me""?    You could just say ""Oh, I got the skin back that I mistakenly traded"". It does not appear that he scammed or tricked you. You just messed up with a trade and are trying to play it off as a scam so that you feel better about it.     Either way, who the fuck cares about semantics   I'm sure that all the people you falsely accuse of being scammers care about those semantics."
LivestreamFails,2zotqh,H_L_Mencken,6,Tue Mar 24 00:42:53 2015 UTC,It is not dishonest if what is being traded is clearly shown right in front of your face. You just made the choice to not actually look at what was being traded.  You're trying to make yourself look like a victim of some grand heist - when really you're just the victim of your own absentmindedness.    This is something done by MANY   Then stop trading shit without looking lol Jeez.

LivestreamFails,2zotqh,Mycaelis,-13,Fri Mar 20 22:02:45 2015 UTC,"""Fairly traded"" is something different and that's what i was hinting at. It was a fair trade in the general sense of course because he agreed to do it but the guy who did it had no fair trade in mind at all. Maybe it's even Valves fault in a way because their trade window is garbage with no item sorting what so ever - put the most valuable items automatically at the first place once the trade window is up so you can easily spot them.   I already commented on the subject in another comment in this thread - you can read that if you want."

Now focus and let's down this."" It would show it's a non-issue for the raid leader and give the guy complaining the chance to either calm down or leave. Instead, at about 1:20 the raid leader does what a lot of people who aren't good with conflict do. He starts mocking and belittling the angry person. He starts with the line ""Like you have some serious issues man. Like you can't separate real life from this game or whatever...""  It doesn't help that several others start rattling off with insults and diminishing comments. At that point, the argument was doomed to end in a disbanding of the guild. The already worked up player was now being ganged up on so he went into all out defense mode.  This situation is incredibly irritating because, like most arguments, it never even needed to happen."

A situation like this doesn't arise out of nowhere with no prior events.  Everything needs to be factored into consideration.  The two were obviously still very sour over something small, and it was only a matter of time until something tweaked them.  Guild disbanding and throwing the other 20 players or so under the bus and then selling over 750 auctions of stuff the guild earned collectively is definitely the mature, correct decision.    https://theunderminejournal.com/#us/kiljaeden/seller/mistbeaver"

It's just a show that if someone is being misogynistic why counter that with more misogyny? Isn't that just a never ending argument?

He randomly quit the raid of ""Rehabilitation Clinic"" while on Azgalor and transferred after subpar play where he joined ""Blood Legion Spec Ops"", failed his trial, and then began changing his name to follow ""Galice/Galiks"" around in guilds secretly without him knowing.    This is Asmodan/Barachus/Telomir - now that the spotlight is shed on him expect him to once again return to the shadows and pick new names besides ""Elder Scrolls""-based names to stay close to people without them even knowing.  This includes transferring to different servers that ""Galice/Galiks"" was in, joining his guild under aliases and trying to get into the raid, and befriending fellow guildmates - all to just secretly stay close to him (the person he is directly calling arrogant in this thread).  http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/kiljaeden/Telomir/advanced  Creep level over 9000  He also was following Galiks on twitch, in addition to several female streamers that he donates to and white knights.

LivestreamFails,2zg379,Kiwibeard,-1,Thu Mar 19 05:44:25 2015 UTC,It's a game.  If you're going to disband because someone called your girlfriend bitchy when she probably was being bitchy you probably shouldn't be in any kind of leadership position.   Even if you did have a problem you handle it between the people.  He just punished an entire guild because of his petty bickering with some other guy.
LivestreamFails,2zg379,rustrustrust,1 point,Fri Mar 20 18:50:08 2015 UTC,The proper response would have been to kick her from the raid if she or anyone was being a problem but unfortunately she had protection.   AS someone  said later in the video to me its worse that she didn't fight her own battle as she went and whined to her boyfriend who punished everyone.   They were both being stupid. Maybe the rest of the raid was just fed up with her also if she was  a repeated problem and people were just tired of not being able to say anything.

He isn't treating her like this to get what he wants from her, he is treating her like this because he knows she won't leave and because he doesn't really care that much if she did.  Basically, it doesn't come down to him actively trying to abuse her to get what he wants. It's not some game to tease people into liking him."
LivestreamFails,2zbpcm,dslyecix,23,Tue Mar 17 14:20:09 2015 UTC,"That may be the case (I don't watch him regularly, or even occasionally) but that's not how you treat another person.  At least not while remaining a normal, respectful human being.  If he doesn't want her the way she wants him, the correct course of action is to set her free, let her get over her feelings and move on to find someone who shares her desire for a relationship.  He's taking advantage of the fact that she loves him to keep a steady girl around he can presumably fuck, while abusing her naivete to let himself see other girls too.  He is absolutely abusing her to get what he wants, even if it's more passively than actively so."
LivestreamFails,2zbpcm,Ickyfist,-22,Tue Mar 17 14:26:53 2015 UTC,"It is easy to say all of that when you don't understand the situation. There are many things about reckful and his relationship that make this not so cut and dry as everyone thinks it is.  1) Reckful has a difficult time understanding his feelings. He wants Jenna to be happy and he likes her but he also has drifted apart from her for so long. It's difficult for him to know if these feelings are just from being apart from her for too long and that he should just stick it out or if he really isn't that into her anymore. He doesn't know ""whether or not he wants her the way she wants him"" (or at least he didn't for a long time). He always thought he would end up with her and that their troubles were just how a relationship had to be over such a long time. Now he has realized that this isn't the case and he IS ""setting her free"".  2) Jenna will do anything to stay with him. IF this means being treated poorly and being in a one-sided open relationship to keep them together by accommodating his doubts and distance from their relationship then that is how it will go. You can't say he is a bad person for agreeing to let her go so far out of her way to keep him. That is what she wanted and she would have been happy as long as he didn't outright break up with her.  He isn't abusing her to get what he wants. He is abusing her because he doesn't know what he wants and so that she can get what she wants."

LivestreamFails,2zbpcm,Asks_Politely,24,Tue Mar 17 08:17:10 2015 UTC,A lot. Is say 200k+ a year.
LivestreamFails,2zbpcm,TargetQ2,22,Tue Mar 17 16:53:35 2015 UTC,"He said (on his stream) after HS he had a PT job and a friend got him on to poker. He started watching it and learning how to play with said friend before putting money down. He started out breaking even, but eventually got better so he would make $300-500 a week. He dropped his PT job so he could get better at poker, and spent his free time playing WoW.  The first time he streamed he passed sodapoppin for views (he was/is considered the best Rogue in the world) and was constantly battling soda for top viewer. He said that after streaming for a week, he gave up poker cause he could easily make a weeks poker earnings in a day. The first day of Hearthstone closed Beta, he was donated $400 to buy packs, alone. Not on top of the other donations he was getting.  Then came stocks. He said that he was making his weeks worth of streaming in a day from the stock market. This is a guy that lost $123k in one day when a company went bankrupt, and he wasn't even upset.   Not sure his net worth, but he has money."
LivestreamFails,2zbpcm,ALoudMouthBaby,8,Tue Mar 17 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"Then came stocks. He said that he was making his weeks worth of streaming in a day from the stock market. This is a guy that lost $123k in one day when a company went bankrupt, and he wasn't even upset.   As far as I can tell he never actually discusses investments. He just makes incredibly vague references to ""stocks"" and having lots of money.   People that make vague references to owning ""stocks"" but never seem to discuss details usually tend to be broke idiots who think making vague references to the stock market makes them sound intelligent AND wealthy.  People that actually make money playing markets live and breathe that type of thing. When they talk about playing the markets they are not vague."

If you think this streaming thing is going to last for decades you are certainly delusional. I hope he is at least smart enough to use that money as an investment for college or his retirement first before putting them into high risk stocks. In reality his job prospects are shot because putting streaming on your resume is not going to land you a job."

I don't even like reckful but he has almost 80k twitter followers and thousands of people that listen to him for hours every day.  that's worth a lot now (not even including the skill required to set such a network up), and the value of that kind of reach is only going to grow with time."

LivestreamFails,2zbpcm,TargetQ2,1 point,Wed Mar 18 01:09:31 2015 UTC,"I replied to someone else saying something similar here  Quite frankly it comes down to is he lying, and if so how much and why. Do you think he wasn't making ridiculous amounts of money streaming? If so, then he has a bunch of fake donations raining in every couple seconds. And then why? Most streamers try to have the illusion that they are struggling so that more people are inclined to donate to support them. Saying you have lots of money is counter productive.  If you think it's to pull in more viewers, maybe. But I know for a fact that Reckful has taken up to 3 months off at a time, when he & Hearthstone were most popular. If he cared about viewers you would think he would stream more consistently.  Lastly, he never plays adds. He mentioned (and it's been mentioned by other streamers) that he doesn't make hardly anything off of Twitch adds, so he stopped running them. He used to have it in his FAQ that a donation of $3 every month or 3 months (can't remember) would be more than in add revenue.   So to answer your question, would I believe everything I am told? No. But to me it logically makes more sense that Reckful has lots of money than that he doesn't."

Few people come out of a relationship that long better off, and if they do, they're probably emotionally numb.    The rub of it is we now know the dude's a dick.

They feel like trolling the people they were jealous of during that time is a way to be the ""cool guys of the Internet"", which consists of knowing that it's Kappa, and not GreyFace that makes the emote, and that knowing how to conjugate ""to win"" in order to say that TSM won, but not doing it propperly anyway is a way to pretend ""I've been acting socially retarded THE WHOLE TIME, even in high school !!1!"" when in fact, they know deep inside they never did.  It's their way to finally be a part of something, to feel included into a society. Which is fine, and human.

Not sure if you know this guy, elajjaz. He streamed Dark Souls speedruns, had 100-300 people at most watching him, pretty fun guy. I was even one of his first subscribers when he got accepted into the program, then stopped watching him because of uni work.  Holy shit how his stream changed. Memes in stream title, kappa emotes (he even made ""his own"" as one of the sub icons), constantly speaking in twitch memes and in general being as generic as possible. And people love it, for some reason.   I had to stop watching a few other people because I couldn't stand how over a week, usually due to getting partnership/sub button, they went from normal streamers to ""HYPERINOO"" screaming retards."

Kappa spam or any spam really, is what makes Twitch fun. A cascade of retards reacting to something otherwise innocuous with hundreds and hundreds of silly faces or quotes is funny.   Think of it as a large crowd watching a person do something. Everyone is constantly shouting out advice on how to do the thing, or making jokes in poor taste about the person's efforts. And when something legitimately funny happens to the person doing the thing, the crowd makes it 10x funnier because everyone is laughing at once.  Do you think a crowd is an ideal place for discussion and debate? Because it's not. Go to Trump's chat and see the folly that thing is. Endless amounts of /r/iamverysmart material. Hordes of intellectual children taking a chatroom too seriously, discussing Trump's oh so brilliant Hearthstone manoeuvres. It's boring and pretentious. If I wanted to discuss Trump's genius I would do so in a medium that supports it, like Reddit or 4chan or literally any other forum.

I will say it again, an instant message chat room is not the right place for discussion and eloquence and wit. For those things you go to places that appreciate it, like Reddit.  Twitch chat is analogous to a crowd at a soccer game. People are screaming and shouting and doing whatever they like; trying to have a good time. And then there's you, the dense one who thinks everyone else should shut the fuck up unless they're using full sentences and big words to describe the game.

LivestreamFails,2yoycl,sgtmas2006,-4,Wed Mar 11 16:44:52 2015 UTC,... And that kids is why you never show your ass on stream.
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,TrillBillvol2,20,Wed Mar 11 16:45:39 2015 UTC,Wait is he streaming himself using a Runescape bot?  The fuck's the point?  Do people really find that interesting?  It doesn't help that Runescape isn't really an interesting game to watch someone else play in the first place.
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,Archey6,7,Wed Mar 11 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"He wasn't botting, it's just a client."
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,sgtmas2006,12,Thu Mar 12 05:58:46 2015 UTC,"Fantastic, I already knew that.  The comment I replied to says this:   Wait is he streaming himself using a Runescape bot? The fuck's the point?   To be botting, he'd have to run a script in the client. The client itself is no different than logging on through the website, and there's even a Jagex-approved client ""RSBuddy Orion"" that was once the biggest bot client for Runescape.  He wasn't botting, just using the client. Like I originally said..."
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,Archey6,-1,Wed Mar 11 16:40:03 2015 UTC,The difference is RSBUDDY Orion is now OSBuddy and does not support scripts for botting anymore.
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,only_your_enemy,7,Wed Mar 11 18:18:10 2015 UTC,"The difference between the two is irrelevant, I only brought up RSBuddy as an example of another client that is more well known.  This isn't a conversation about whether or not he was using a client that supports botting scripts, or the differences between clients, it's about whether or not he was botting. He absolutely was not, please stop bringing up completely irrelevant things."
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,Archey6,-1,Wed Mar 11 18:39:14 2015 UTC,Why is it accepted in the RS Community to use a botting clients (even if you dont run scripts)?
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,sepulker,5,Wed Mar 11 19:03:14 2015 UTC,Because it literally causes no harm whatsoever to use a botting client and not use scripts.
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,SG-,1 point,Wed Mar 11 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"And why would someone use the botting client over the OSBuddy Client or the vanilla client? Whats the advantages?  Not trying to argue here, I'm just confused why a community does accept using a botting client openly. I mean, this only encourages spreading of the client which in return makes it easier for People to bot because all they now need is a Script they have to run."
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,Darkstrategy,2,Wed Mar 11 21:27:50 2015 UTC,The vanilla client sucks fucking dick.
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,We0921,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:41:44 2015 UTC,"For the last few years it's been really hard to bot on Runescape, I just went over to the Powerbot/RSBot (now the biggest botting client) forums and a lot of people are saying they get banned within 3hours - a day or two.   Using the client doesn't really cause any harm, because if anybody uses it to try and bot they'll be permanently banned quite quickly."
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,Harperlarp,-3,Thu Mar 12 07:09:47 2015 UTC,The client is what gets people banned though
LivestreamFails,2yoycl,Johnnyb3Good,1 point,Thu Mar 12 07:55:15 2015 UTC,"No, it's not. You're allowed to run some clients as long as you don't run scripts."

I can see why someone would get pissed over that. Especially if it's her birthday too and no one cared. And probably no one cared in real life too. And she learns she is now being replaced. I can see why people would rage over that and I don't think it's that egocentric.

Come to think of it, these people aren't any less disrespectful to guys, they just change the profanity they use based on your skin colour/gender!  It's not too hard to find regular people who just want to play games, and treat people like people, regardless of who they are. But it's also not too hard to find shitty people either.  And when it comes to this video and the girl in it, I've heard and seen many male players that say stupid stuff and make a fool of themselves online. When a female does it, it's literally no different. Both genders can be dumb as fuck. We just don't pay as much attention to it when it's a guy because its a mainly male demographic."
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,Trewper-,1 point,Mon Mar 2 16:28:58 2015 UTC,"These are pretty good points, but it depends on the game you are playing. In FFXI and WoW, the only behavior I really saw was what I mentioned, guys drooling over every female member of any guild and sucking up to them, no matter how rude or terrible at the game said females may have been. Though on the opposite spectrum, I am playing FFXIV now, and in our very large guild, we have a ton of couples and women who are just chill as fuck, I haven't seen any of the previously mentioned behavior, or any rude behavior that you mentioned. Not that they don't exist in any other games, or even in some guilds of these games, I just haven't experienced it, despite playing each of these mmorpgs for 2-7 years each.  My main point was that the majority of the behavior I see is what I mentioned. Guys going crazy over every female member in the game, thinking they will get with them. A lot of the time, this allows or causes the female to think she is the queen and crave the attention she gets. The behavior you mentioned absolutely exists, there are just flat-out assholes in every game, but as you also mentioned, they are equally as rude to other people of other genders, races etc. so it's kind of a moot point."
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,Samuraiking,41,Mon Mar 2 19:52:39 2015 UTC,It sounds like she doesn't want her raid spot and since she doesn't know the fights she should get benched for being a drama queen and not doing any research.  I hope she got gkicked because harboring those sorts of players is a great way to fail cascade any community. As soon as people start feeling entitled to spots based on time spent in a guild rather than merit you need to get rid of that entitlement and lay down the law.

It's the same as them taking one crazy girl and applying it to all women. You're going to get people who are mean to you. You're going to get people who invite you just because of X reason. It happens. But you need to play the game and find the right group just like everyone else. I have to do it as well. Just because some guys says ""oh gurlz le gamers suck."" Doesn't mean everyone does.   And when he said ""guilds want girls"" he meant it in the way that they want some girls in the group to break up the monotony of it JUST being guys. It's fun to have something different for once. Like people on North American realms like Australians sometimes because it's unique and different.

Play the games you enjoy, you meet someone who's levelheaded, add them on steam/skype, and try to play with them more often. Keep adding people who aren't completely lacking in the social skill/common sense department, boom, now you have a group to play with who aren't complete idiots. Also, if you feel like every single person you meet is an ass, or is against you in some way, it's probably time for an attitude change. I run into people that are asshats every now and then, but a majority of the people don't care, and just want to play the game.

LivestreamFails,2xnizd,Zaeh,14,Mon Mar 2 12:58:49 2015 UTC,"Wasting? I'd sure as hell continue doing something I very much like, despite having a near death situation. Unless that situation was directly caused by it, of course."
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,HellbenderXG,-11,Tue Mar 3 22:16:23 2015 UTC,"Sitting in your chair all day, eating unhealthy rubbish? I'd say it was the direct cause of whatever she was in the hospital for. It doesn't matter whether she likes it or not. It's bad if it's all she lives for."
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,herkaburger,13,Mon Mar 2 21:03:23 2015 UTC,Playing WoW isn't synonymous with sitting in your chair all day or eating unhealthy rubbish. All you're doing now is ignorantly enforcing stereotypes.
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,Zaeh,-11,Tue Mar 3 06:33:54 2015 UTC,Listen to the video.
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,Bashasaurus,6,Tue Mar 3 08:11:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, she's an asshole. How does that link to your previous comment?  Spoiler Alert: it doesn't."
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,adanceparty,4,Tue Mar 3 10:26:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sure. That doesn't change the fact that playing WoW was not the direct result of her going to a hospital. It's all the other shit around it, that have varying stages of little to do with the actual game itself."
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,Bashasaurus,-6,Tue Mar 3 12:13:19 2015 UTC,"Some people have a total inability to distinguish between people they play games with online and friends.  I've played mmo's and fps's for years online and met thousands of people, spent serious time with 100's of them but the amount of real friends that came from it...  zero.  As soon as the interest in the game/guild/clan ends the ""friendship"" ends."
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,adanceparty,10,Wed Mar 4 07:40:12 2015 UTC,"then you didn't make great friends. I met my best friends on xbox live over 7 years ago. We transitioned to pc, we played wow together. We quit wow, we played LoL together, minecraft, terraria, resident evil. We continue to play games and speak almost daily. I don't make a lot of money but I go 900 miles to hang with them in person for a week every year and it's great. I've met hundreds in real life within 20 miles of me and none of them are good friends or even great to hang out with. It's all luck of the draw or time invested."
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,imkirok,3,Tue Mar 3 12:20:43 2015 UTC,"In hindsight I probably didn't think out my post.  Of course I made friends but like any longterm relationship they were fragile and over the span of years I couldn't even tell you how to contact them anymore so of course you can make and maintain online friendships but what I was speaking more to is especially in a guild of 50 people, you may see and interact with them daily but that doesn't equate to friendship and that was what I meant.  Some people just don't really seem to be able to distinguish between an acquaintice and a friendship.... I did not put enough effort into the first post to be clear, my bad!  and now I've overdone it trying to clarify shrug"
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,Auroros,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:31:04 2015 UTC,Nah thought about it later and thought I should clarify that I do understand this situation though. upset that guildies didn't call and visit her in the hospital and stuff? She definitely doesn't understand friends vs acquaintances.
LivestreamFails,2xnizd,saminga81,-8,Tue Mar 3 00:03:17 2015 UTC,That's kind of fucked no one wished her well when she was in the hospital though... Assuming they knew that is.

LivestreamFails,2wowzf,ItsTempaaa,43,Sat Feb 21 21:03:45 2015 UTC,"while I do blame him for taking it, She knew there was only one mic and should have controlled the situation better. Fuck thats hard to watch.  I used to work in tv news, constantly had people trying to grab the mic when the interview starts, you just have to be solid and not let go, let them grab your hand around the mic, they'll feel awkward and stop... instead she just lets go like if he touches her skin she will melt...  (Edit) I just finally watched further into the video. She finally gets her shit together, But damn that kid keeps trying, My favorite is the ""thumb and pointer finger with the pinkie up like a royal drinking tea"" grab on the windscreen of the mic."
LivestreamFails,2wowzf,Deadpool1205,-17,Sat Feb 21 23:46:32 2015 UTC,"The videos 2 minutes long, you seriously couldn't finish it before writing up a paragraph about it? She very clearly had control of things from the start, this kid is just socially retarded."
LivestreamFails,2wowzf,evilchefwariobatali,11,Sun Feb 22 03:19:41 2015 UTC,"what?  look I'm not saying she was the worst part of the video, but she totally didn't do this well, as stated she gave the mic up right away, this is what caused him to then continue to grab for it.  she asked two questions off mic, knowing no one could hear her. she then asked about his sweatshirt... This was just painful to watch.   and I stopped not because of length but because she was doing such a piss poor job of leading this ""Social Retard"" through the interview, that I didn't think it would get much better. And it doesn't, I just found entertainment in his different methods of attempting to grab the mic again."
LivestreamFails,2wowzf,Deadpool1205,-11,Sun Feb 22 03:25:47 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, but to be fair to this girl, she gave up the mic right away because he took it. Was she supposed to just yank it back? She certainly wasn't perfect but interviewing guys like this is probably very very difficult."
LivestreamFails,2wowzf,evilchefwariobatali,9,Sun Feb 22 04:20:32 2015 UTC,"I get that, but essentially yes, she should have held it tight. So she remains in control. And i do understand it was difficult, just saying had she not made that first mistake the whole thing could have gone better"

LivestreamFails,2wowzf,ClocksandDocks,7,Sun Feb 22 11:25:37 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but my point is that you don't have to pay to get the best cards. It just takes longer. It's not like other games where content you pay for is superior to free content, it's all from one pool of content."
LivestreamFails,2wowzf,Binerexis,-1,Sun Feb 22 09:34:09 2015 UTC,Surely it's more correct to say that it takes significantly longer if you don't put money into the system?

LivestreamFails,2wowzf,ClocksandDocks,7,Tue Feb 24 21:42:52 2015 UTC,"Again, you've missed my point. I'm not saying that you are incorrect that player who will spend money on the game will win more matches (sooner, at least). So I'll say it again, all content is in the same pool, and therefore it is not pay to win. Some games, you pay and you get better weapons/characters/whatever. Hearthstone is not one of those games. Therefore, it is not pay to win."

LivestreamFails,2wm671,undanny,77,Sat Feb 21 02:12:50 2015 UTC,"In Fifa, there is a coin system, where you earn Pretend money from playing, and using the transfer market, where you can sell players you get from packs. EA has something called Fifa points, which allows you to only open packs, and its expensive. So these websites found a way to farm the coins, and sells them for dirt cheap via the transfer market. This streamer promotes one of these websites, and its illegal to buy, sell and promote.

LivestreamFails,2wm671,AGREENLIZARD,22,Sat Feb 21 05:14:22 2015 UTC,Its easy to think that way. But its not better. The people who buys millions of coins raises the prices of players so much that free to play players Cant do any thing. Fifapoints are so expensive that noone buys it in a huge bulk
LivestreamFails,2wm671,AGREENLIZARD,-13,Sat Feb 21 06:17:30 2015 UTC,"well lets stop right there, EA made a $60 game and they are making micro transaction possible but increasing the price these coins?  please correct me if i am wrong, is EA allowing you to use real money to buy coins or points?"
LivestreamFails,2wm671,Centauris,7,Sat Feb 21 08:31:21 2015 UTC,"Im sorry, EA lets you buy the points, making you only able to open packs. While the websites which is illegal, sells coins, that can be used for packs, and buying players from the transfer market."

And why would anyone buy points for 99 dollars which gets you about 93 packs, rather than 5 million coins (which is a lot) and get to chose what to use them on, or open 666 packs.   To show you how much 5 mill is, take it like this. 1 game that lasts 12 minutes gives you about 400 coins"
LivestreamFails,2wm671,javitogomezzzz,-3,Sat Feb 21 08:42:51 2015 UTC,"the problem resides with EA and their retarded microtransaction gimmick, remove the ability to pay real money to EA for points and only allow coins, EA wont make any money but big deal its not like they are hurting for money am i right, so why do they need to do microtransactions and get mad when players cheat the system? if they never would have charged anyone money for points they wouldnt have this problem, the are thinking GREEDY like they always do, thats why i no longer support or buy ANY EA games"
LivestreamFails,2wm671,Pep_Gorgonzola,2,Sat Feb 21 10:46:24 2015 UTC,that's fine. the millions they are making off of Microtransactions will cancel out the butt hurt people like you not buying their games anymore.
LivestreamFails,2wm671,javitogomezzzz,1 point,Sat Feb 21 19:42:52 2015 UTC,EA just needs to get rid of the point system and sell coins. At a price that makes it inconvenient for coin farmers. They would make way more money and resolve the issue. 20$ gets you 2 top packs which guarantees nothing. But go to a coin seller and you get 15mil coins that cost 30$ (ios). 15mil coins is the limit for market transactions so guaranteed the best player(toty messi/Ronaldo)  or a ton of gold player packs for 50k/100k coins.

LivestreamFails,2wf3o3,MarkJankowski,15,Thu Feb 19 14:20:04 2015 UTC,"Ok here's some insight. Tip's friend Jake was on skype with him when a girl sent him a msg that she's nearby his home, ending up leaving his skype on with cam. He came back and stuff started to happen, when we were watching it. As soon as they started kissing tip removed his cam but since other people were on the skype call aswell, streamed it on another website There was some action there but not much. He didn't do anything wrong as he didn't show porn, both were dressed before tip removed the cam. we didn't even see even kissing action. The ban happened after he ended his stream, and most likely is not perma but 24-48 hours. It's not his fault that someone else streamed this to another site, the catch must be that he had tip's stream behind the skype call  tl;dr: there was a second stream going on with a skype call with sex involving but nothing explicit showed up, tip got the blame, that's all"

LivestreamFails,2w4lcm,HowGamersPlay,-28,Sat Feb 21 03:50:04 2015 UTC,"Yes that is a general rule of the channel, don't say he's not mad, because his whole party just got wiped in a permadeath game.  I think what you posted is more applied to when he gets a sub he puts on this devilish background and voice and thanks them in, which might offend some people.  Of course it may be somewhat exaggerated for entertainments sake, I mean he knows he is being recorded etc. But people do actually rage in real life aswell.   Edit: Not sure if I misunderstood your comment, that you mean it's funny he gets so mad when his channel rule is to not take things too seriously. The way I read it makes it seem like you are calling him an entertainer and saying that it was for show."

No.   Do I think he's pissed off and wants to smash the keyboard?   Yes, haven't we all been at some point? I know I have.  This is what I meant by my first comment.

LivestreamFails,2w4lcm,Milhouse_is_a_meme,2,Tue Feb 17 04:04:06 2015 UTC,I've only seen it streamed briefly.  That's why I'm asking.  It looks like it only has like 5 levels.
LivestreamFails,2w4lcm,FostertheReno,11,Tue Feb 17 04:14:17 2015 UTC,It'll probably take 50-100 hours to finish all 5 zones once theyre out

LivestreamFails,2w4lcm,Milhouse_is_a_meme,3,Tue Feb 17 05:23:02 2015 UTC,"I would definitely recommend trying it out.  It's a game that could definitely work for mobile, so it might come out on iPad."
LivestreamFails,2w4lcm,thekeanu,0,Tue Feb 17 06:58:01 2015 UTC,"I thought it was really fun, but after a few hours in once you tried out all the characters and stuff it does get a bit boring. The dungeons can be pretty repetative and there aren't too many enemy types. The biggest problem that I have is that the game is ridiculously easy after your first dungeon or two. It's almost impossible to lose a character once you have a semi decent party, and even if you do you get 4+ new recruits between every mission, so it's impossible to actually lose the game. Hopefully once more content is added it'll get a bit better, because overall I still like the game a lot. The art style is nice and the narrator is absolutely badass."

Let me put it this way. Fighting games is all mechanics with reaction time and character movement. The strategy of fighting games is so minimal compared to mobas and fps games. Your response is based on such an elitist viewpoint which again proves my previous point. But lets get back to the main arguement. Tell me how fighting games provide a superior stategical aspect of gameplay compared to mobas and fps games, thus creating a higher skill cap which you said is 10x that of a moba or fps. In fighting games it's a 1 on 1 battle. You use your knowledge of combos and counters to outplay your opponent. You also use your mechanical skill and reaction time which separates the good from the best. Different characters obviously have different purposes. WHAT STRATEGICAL ASPECT other than knowledge on counters and characters is there? Now how do you determine that fighting games has a higher skill cap when you only have to focus on a 1v1 game? LETS look at games like league of legends, dota 2, csgo. All three games are 5 on 5 games. They're team games. You not only have to worry about your individual gameplay but how well you work as a team. Let's talk about individual gameplay first to display the amount of skill needed to become one of the best individual players at the game. First i will discuss league of legends. ITS very similar to fighting games. RAW Mechanics is what separates the great from the good. Your clicking precision as well as your knowledge and reaction time are all important and vital aspects to your individual skill. THESE are similar aspects shared in competitive fighting games. They're completely similar. It can be argued both ways so i say that this aspect of individual play is similar. But that's only 1 aspect of competitive play for mobas. Now about STRATEGY. MOBAS are real time strategy games. Strategy is 50% of the game if not more. In a setting of a 3 lane map with over 100 champions and items the meta/strategy is endless and consists of thousands of possibilities. Professional moba players have to focus and adapt to these changes on a weekly basis. I will laugh at you if you can even compare the meta/strategy of fighting games to that of a MOBAs. It's not even comparable. Do fighting games have specific strategy map movements? No it's locked in a two dimensional screen with one player to the left and one player to the right. WHAT strategy is there other than countering moves and moving your character for a finishing blow? There's strategy when to move in another character to sub in etc. but that doesn't even exist for all fighting games like street fighter. It's so one-dimensional. So to argue that fighting games have a higher skillcap shows that you don't appreciate the strategic aspect of competitive games. You're basically the tennis player in sports. All you do is hit a tennis ball over and over again. What separates the good from the bad is your raw mechanical skill. How hard you can hit the tennis ball and how well you can aim. That's it. There's no thinking involved. Jk i lied there is you can do research and find weaknesses of your opponent but that's it. But then there's football which i would compare to the mobas. The game without a doubt appreciates raw mechanical skill. People adore those flashy plays. BUT At the end of the day it's the strategical aspect of calls and plays that gives a team a win. And that's why it's so popular. Because on a basic level everyone will appreciate the skill of the individual. But on a more advanced level is the strategy behind the game, something that doesn't exist on a similar level of a fighting game or tennis game. So calling a fighting game a 10x more skilledcapped game is an absolute joke. I'm done. Please enlighten me on how fighting games take so much more skill. Edit: That's right don't respond but downvote me. What a joke. God i hate elitists they're always so ignorant of anything other than what they believe in. And don't even think about calling me an elitist. IM simply arguing with you and providing evidence from what i have seen from two different perspectives."

Also I don't even play fighting games, I just dislike people that think everything has to be professional, or catered to their sensibilities, it's obviously not shit to the people that enjoy it and gentrifying it would ruin it's uniqueness.   As for a serious point I think mechanical skill is much more taxing than strategy, the average player can read up on strats and blame losses on their team to keep thinking their good in a moba, 1v1 in a fighting or rts game you get shrekt and you'll probably never improve enough to beat someone who naturally has better reflexes, it's disheartening and you have nothing to blame so it's inherently worse for casuals."

LivestreamFails,2vujmo,MrJellly,22,Sat Feb 14 06:31:34 2015 UTC,"The glitch is called ""Item Manipulation"" or ""IM"" for short. It was found many years ago but they have only perfected it and found a use for it maybe 9 or 10 days ago. So the trick is fairly new.  While the camera is locked, you can pick up an item for the first time, then get hit by an enemy. During this state, you can write a specific value to the game by standing in front of a chest. What Skater was doing was climbing Deku Tree to stand infront of the chest where you get the map from. This will give that item a value. Once you obtain that value, you can jump into a body of water (It has to be deep enough so that Link is in his swimming animation).  After he's in the water he will hold up an invisible item.  Depending on the contents inside of the chest you stood in front of, will determine what item will appear in the inventory. You can either get light arrows early or a blue bottle. The bottle is better as it makes the category he is running (Any%) partially quicker.  Here is a video of the glitch in action."
LivestreamFails,2vujmo,CarlR818,2,Sat Feb 14 13:51:53 2015 UTC,It was found many years ago but they have only perfected it and found a use for it maybe 9 or 10 days ago.   Never say a speedrunning method is perfected in a game as big as this. You never know what innovations poeple discover next.  Definitely improved.
LivestreamFails,2vujmo,tadpoleloop,1 point,Thu Feb 19 17:04:36 2015 UTC,How does the bottle speed up the game?
LivestreamFails,2vujmo,Empire_Of_The_Mug,2,Mon Mar 16 22:16:12 2015 UTC,"In the old route, you would have to leave Kokiri Forest through the Lost Woods with Forest Escape and WESS to Kakariko Village where you would collect all of the cuccos to get a bottle. Collecting the cuccos can be rather time consuming based on the RNG. Collecting the cuccos will give you a bottle.  In the new route, you don't ever have to leave Kokiri Forest. You get a bottle from Item Manipulation and then you go to the Lost Woods to get a bug.  So it's faster because you don't have to WESS to Kakariko Village or rely on the RNG of the cuccos."
LivestreamFails,2vujmo,CarlR818,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:30:19 2015 UTC,"What's the purpose of the bug? In the world record speedrun posted below, he never uses the bug"
LivestreamFails,2vujmo,Empire_Of_The_Mug,1 point,Mon Mar 16 22:53:06 2015 UTC,"You need the bottled bug to perform a glitch known as Ocarina Items. It allows you to play a fake ocarina when you don't have the actual ocarina yet.  If you perform Ocarina Items in the basement of Deku Tree on the blue warp, you can start the infamous Ganondoor glitch.  This video should help you."
LivestreamFails,2vujmo,CarlR818,1 point,Mon Mar 16 23:00:10 2015 UTC,"He does. Item Manipulation gives him a bottle. If Link is holding a full bottle in his hand and you press the button for the bottle then another item while in the air, the game thinks you played the ocarina. By playing the ocarina and entering the end dungeon warp at the same time, you trigger the game to play a the Kokiri Emerald cutscene but don't warp. By manipulating the camera to show the portal for a certain number of frames and leaving the boss room at a certain angle, you wrong warp to the final area of the game."
LivestreamFails,2vujmo,thatJainaGirl,13,Thu Mar 19 14:50:09 2015 UTC,Recently someone discovered a way to get a bottle which is a broken item needed for speed runs in the deku tree. It looks like he was trying to copy that as it's been said getting the item this early could save a llt of time in speed runs. But he messed up and fell in the water which I guess messes up the glitch

It would be different if it looked liked these people had careers+streaming, but they only have streaming. In addition, most won't work when they pull in 100K a year.   Pair that up with relevancy, does anyone want to watch 35 year old streamers? Any girl streamer is going to have issues post-30 because of looks, males will lose relevancy based on age (not-relate-able).   I just don't see how this can keep going for 10+ years.

LivestreamFails,2vhh4o,midairroxx,1 point,Sun Feb 22 23:30:01 2015 UTC,"Swifty is in his 40's, I believe he's said it on stream before.  Sodapoppin also has 5k subs consistently so he rakes in a guaranteed $150,000 a year on top of probably another $100,000 in donations along with t-shirt revenue, youtube ads, and sponsorships.  Not to mention Amhai and company donations.  He won't need to work because he'll have so much cash on hand.  When you have that much money smart investments can potentially keep you going.  For example a Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF can net you decent money if you were to invest  $700,000.  If Soda streams and makes consistently $250-$300k a year he can potentially invest that much.  If Sodapoppin invested $700,000 in that ETF and their quarterly dividends were $.47 per share he'd make $19,000 just off that before any taxes."

Him and Keemstar started a stream together and they started a ""donation war"" to see who could get the most free money in a certain time (The amount of money can be seen in the bottom right of OP's video). They were playing GTAV but it  was basically keemstar driving around in a limo while blade sat in the back reading off donations for like an hour and a half. Then when the time was up on this ""war"" Keemstar started getting really pissed off saying that Blades viewers were DDOS'ing his donation button (topkek) and that's why Blade got more donations. So Blade decides to allow another 5 mins of donations to make it fair, which makes a flood more of donations come in. Clearly it was all a plan to get as much money as possible from their gullible viewers by making them think that they are helping their fav streamer win this made up war. I mean Keemstar and Blade are friends in real life, why would Keem be pissed that his friend got more free money than him?

When I - and loads of others - used to stream to hundreds/thousands of viewers on JTV years ago, it was for the pleasure of streaming and interacting with people. Now it has just devolved into a bunch of YouTube style actors faking reactions, popping cleavage (male or female), and sitting in their basement getting pissed that someone only gave them a free dollar. I appreciate that people want to make a living out of this, but shit, the whole culture that has built up around trying to be the next KSI or PewDiePie has got really out of control.

LivestreamFails,2vfcyi,that_guy_on_the_lawn,68,Wed Feb 11 04:06:24 2015 UTC,"I used to watch gaming on JTV and then on Twitch all the time.  Now I almost never watch it.  Twitch has devolved into a never-ending telethon.  On most streams the game play is constantly interrupted by donation, subscription, and follower announcements, and on many that has become the actual focus of the stream itself.  Can you imagine watching a YouTube video, but getting a notice every time someone favorited the video, or added it to a playlist?  It's not about saying donations, subscriptions, following, or financially supporting streamers is wrong, it's the implementation. They know that psychologically the constant reminders increase the flow of money, just like a telethon, and are willing to sacrifice the game play to chase after the dream of being a full-time caster."
LivestreamFails,2vfcyi,Beer_is_good_for_you,13,Wed Feb 11 04:59:17 2015 UTC,"Hit the nail on the head. One big telethon and constant interruptions, which sacrifices quality for a quick buck."

He is exactly like the fuckers on YouTube who ask to like fave and subscribe.   Nobody will do it because we aren't a bunch of mindless drones. I'm pretty damn sure neither KSI or pewdiepie do that.
LivestreamFails,2vfcyi,that_guy_on_the_lawn,11,Tue Feb 10 18:43:36 2015 UTC,"I believe that there are some major differences between what's happening on Twitch and YouTube. On Youtube, you are probably only going to be asked to hit the like, fave, and sub buttons at the end of the video. No one is flat out asking for money, unless it's something like Subbable (which would actually be a great way to cut down on the telethon-like feel of Twitch). They ask for likes, faves, and subs because that's the primary way they get feedback on the content and that's what Google uses to determine placement.  On Twitch, you're getting constant psychological pressure during the entire stream to flat out give them cash. The constant reminders that other people are donating and subscribing exerts tremendous psychological pressure on other viewers to get out their wallets. For example, I've seen several streams, by various casters, where people have apologized for not having enough money to subscribe or donate, or, worse, said that they really can't afford it, but ""here's all the money I have"" or similar messages. Especially when you don't see the caster's face (Lirik), or you only see them in front of a greenscreen, it's very easy to imagine them as poor casters, barely making ends meet, when in reality they might be pulling in more money in a week then most of their viewers might make in a year. That's one of the reasons I've stopped watching Twitch.  Of course, on Twitch, streamers get feedback through chat all the time, but it's not about feedback to many casters, it's about the dollars. So many people are chasing the dream of casting fulltime. It's another thing that's heartbreaking.  I'm just saying that there is a difference between Twitch and YouTube in this regard, and that it sickens me to see people apologizing, or giving money they can't afford, to casters with high viewership."

Honestly, as someone who was one of Sky's earlier fans of both his YT and Twitch, I do take notice of a decline in his personality. I barely follow his content anymore, the little he does release.  As someone who went through the vast majority of an education program and stepped out because it was just too much combined with some personal issues, I have the utmost respect for what teachers in America deal with. Shitting on them without knowing what you're talking about instantly knocks you down several notches in how I see you as a person."

He revolves around a persona of a gay guy bitching about stuff, minus the gay part and it's the epiphany of why people hate playing league and it's community.  No problem with his sexual preference, but all he does is bitch albeit in a way that is funny to many people.

I was selling a knife not long ago and Penguin was the only MM that accepted my request (I added THROUGH Steamrep and it added THAT account with 2 games).

LivestreamFails,2uag7q,BertDeathStare,6,Mon Feb 2 02:16:14 2015 UTC,I don't. I use Chrome for regular stuff and just open up Firefox if I want to look at stuff I don't want others knowing about. You can set options to clear all history every time you close Firefox.
LivestreamFails,2uag7q,felixthemaster1,16,Mon Feb 2 03:13:13 2015 UTC,Why not incog? seems a lot easier than opening up another browser
LivestreamFails,2uag7q,BertDeathStare,-6,Mon Feb 2 03:21:43 2015 UTC,"Well it takes about 2 clicks and 2 seconds to open up Firefox which is probably about the same as opening an incog tab.  Another thing is if I open Chrome, and then Firefox, they go next to eachother on the bottom of my screen (where you can see what programs and stuff are currently up). So I can instantly click to change and their icons pretty easy to differentiate between.  If I open Chrome and then an incog, they don't go beside eachother, they go behind eachother because they're both from Chrome. So each time I want to switch, I would have to click on the Chrome icon, and then select normal or incog. Seems like more of a hassle.  That and just being used to it."

Well, thanks for telling me but I'm alright, it's really the same either way. Either I move my fingers and hold 2 buttons or I move the mouse and click once.

LivestreamFails,2uag7q,Chippas,2,Sat Jan 31 22:56:16 2015 UTC,"The reson he didn't realize before going with the trade was because he didn't check out penguins steam profile.

LivestreamFails,2uag7q,JohnCoffee23,1 point,Sat Jan 31 20:43:36 2015 UTC,Why would someone send payment before receiving the item?
LivestreamFails,2uag7q,GAMEchief,1 point,Sat Jan 31 20:28:08 2015 UTC,I'm probably wrong here but it seems like it would be easier to get your money back if you're paying with paypal as opposed to sending an item and probably never getting it back.
LivestreamFails,2uag7q,RacerX09,6,Sat Jan 31 20:47:32 2015 UTC,"Don't ever trust PayPal, period. Their refund policies are completely arbitrary. I had a guy take back a few hundred dollars for work I did. They send you an email asking you to prove you did it, which I did. I forwarded emails to them from him saying the work was done, as well as multiple other screenshots of conversations of me showing the work as well as giving the documents to him. They said it was insufficient evidence (I am literally clueless as to what would count as sufficient evidence, if the actual product itself nor the receiver stating that they received it doesn't count) and refunded him anyway.  I am 90% positive that all PayPal does it says whoever has the largest bank account is correct in any dispute."

It's one of the most competitive games which is what i love about it, i mean counterstrike: source was huge back in the day without skins."
LivestreamFails,2uag7q,JohnCoffee23,3,Sat Jan 31 22:16:00 2015 UTC,"Well we know that to not be the case based on the history of CS:GO. The competitive CS players didn't like it. Casual players didn't like it. Valve added skins to create a community in the game and it was hugely successful. Casual players got into it because there was this strange gambling, progression system put in place. Streamers started playing just to open cases and it brought a lot of new interest into the game. A lot of people do see the merit of it as a competitive game now, but without the addition of skins no one would have cared and the game might even be dead by now."

LivestreamFails,2uag7q,iLikeToBiteMyBalls,5,Sun Feb 1 19:19:46 2015 UTC,"Scarcity and the fact that other people want them and are therefore willing to spend money on them.  The only feasible way to obtain a rare CS:GO item is by spending $2.50 on a key to open a case and hope to randomly get the item (the vast majority of the time you get something worth very little).  The average amount of cases someone would have to open to get that item or something comparable almost certainly costs more than the cost of the items themselves.  The whole cases/keys system is economically very similar to Magic: the Gathering cards, and I am sure there are a number of detailed articles explaining the economics of Magic cards, if you want more details."
LivestreamFails,2uag7q,Catacrusis,2,Mon Feb 2 16:29:45 2015 UTC,"Real money..if it was ingame it would be a simple trade dude wtf...  It's so expensive because knifes are extremely rare,  it's one of the new skins, it's factory new and it tracks your number of kills.

LivestreamFails,2uag7q,iLikeToBiteMyBalls,-17,Sun Feb 1 20:01:32 2015 UTC,"Man, they've ruined TF2 doing that same bullshit. Fuck this new Valve. Honestly, I can't stand this company anymore, and I can't stand its new community either. Fuck cases, fuck crates. What the fuck do you gain by getting a cosmetic item? Nothing. Absolutely nothing game-wise, though you might get something that's 'visually appealing' to the basement dwellers and make a buck or two.  Whatever happened to content? You know, shit that actually affects the game? Oh right, skins affect the game. 'Operations' that you have to pay 6 fucking dollars for is 'content'. Music kits, just wtf. Who in their right mind thinks any of this shit is acceptable?   Micro transactions are pushed into your face every single day you play CS. Oh you played for a while and now you get an item drop, here let me give you a case. Let me make more than half of your drops cases and the rest dull skins so you can be forced to pay money on pixels that you don't need.  When you load the game up you're greeted with advertisements for items and 'special offers'. And there's no way to turn off skins.  People honestly believe that paying for all these micro transactions are helping build CS:GO. Fucking stupidity at its finest. As though a company that makes more than a hundred million dollars from Steam alone is going to need more funding. Pull your head out of your ass, look at how much money Valve is making. They have more than enough to completely upgrade CS:GO, to hire competent software developers to fix the critical bugs that have still not been touched on for over 3 years.  But no, Valve chooses not to. Instead, it continues to fill its pockets. How much fucking money does a company need? Especially a gaming company? Apparently all of it."
LivestreamFails,2uag7q,vmldu,2,Sat Jan 31 10:08:00 2015 UTC,"I guess I don't understand the issue.  I don't play either game, so I'm not entirely sure on the system.  You're making it sound like you get cosmetic character and weapon skins from the game that have no affect on actual game play.  I fail to see the issue if that's the case.  A cosmetic item that has no game play value doesn't give anyone else a disadvantage.  If a company is able to generate additional revenue by offering things that don't change game play that's great.  That doesn't harm the game in any way and allows them to continue supporting their projects as a company.  Tangent aside...I still feel bad for that guy.  Sadly the Steam trade TOS is made pretty clear and prompts you several times throughout the process."
LivestreamFails,2uag7q,Leaxe,1 point,Sat Jan 31 12:01:01 2015 UTC,"Actual game play? No, it has no effect. The community, on the other hand, that's a different story. The majority of new CS:GO players are there just for skins. They're terrible at the game, in fact a lot of them don't even play the game. They just want the 'cool' skins.  This means that every time Valve releases a new case these people get an erection and start praising valve for the 'hard work' it's putting into this game when they don't even know how many issues that are affecting gameplay have not been fixed for the past 3 fucking years."

A direct trade leaves whichever party who sent their item first at risk of being scammed. However if you have a trustworthy middleman, he can broker the trades and should someone not live up to their end of the bargain, he can just return the other item back to the original owner.  On the other hand, a middleman would have both goods from both parties in this scenario so a trustworthy middleman is very important."

LivestreamFails,2uag7q,minus1millionKarma,10,Sun Feb 1 06:33:06 2015 UTC,"He was trading an ingame knife for real money. The simplest way to do this is to agree to send money via paypal and trade the knife over. Unfortunately, this means if one party wants to scam the other it's really easy to do so.  The other way is to use a middleman.  You trade your items to the middleman, the middleman tells the other guy to give you the money, and once you get the money, the middleman gives the other guy your items.  Steamrep has a list of middlemen you can use. At 3:03, you can see this list.  When the streamer asked about getting a middleman in, the scammer got an account that appeared to be ""Penguin the Fluffy"", one of those middlemen. He linked the streamer to that middleman, and tricked him with that.  The Penguin the Fluffy as shown in the video, with broken English and only 2 games on his account is fake.  The streamer traded the fake middleman his knife, and that's it, really. The streamer lost his knife and isn't getting  his money. The scammer then asks for the M4A1, which is him basically trying to get more stuff."

LivestreamFails,2tzdm1,Not_your_average_ant,11,Wed Jan 28 23:46:05 2015 UTC,"Teamviewer is a program that lets someone else take control of your computer from their own computer. It's a tool mainly used to help people with computer problems that are too lengthy to explain in words and would be handled better by doing it yourself.   Though both parties need the program, and the owner of the computer has to give the person that wants in their one time log on and password, this makes it so no random person could take control of your computer, and if someone did get into it, they wouldn't be able to again because the log in and password has changed.   What happened here was he accidentally showed on stream his one time log on and password, and someone that was watching the stream took control of his computer, and sent himself $1000 of the streamers money without him knowing."
LivestreamFails,2tzdm1,lamBerticus,6,Thu Jan 29 00:09:39 2015 UTC,Thanks. But why would he be using a program like that while playing poker? And who would be dumb enough to show something that important in a livestream with random viewers?

He did this so often that he created that ""mob mentality"" and his viewers would join other streams and just spam his stupid GiG type of crap.   He created a negative community around his stream the past few months and I'm glad its gone. Twitch doesn't need streamers like this.

LivestreamFails,2tsdpi,Mongrel54,33,Thu Jan 29 01:48:01 2015 UTC,"SOE needed someone to be a villain for their erroneous decision. They were looking for top midnight to late in the morning streamers, and GIG had the most viewership during those hours.  But they didn't Vette him, like the representative claimed. Instead of investing the thirty seconds to look at his stream like he claimed, he saw 5k viewers, and then hosted him without GIG's knowledge or consent.  So when the question was raised on SOE reddit, Legion stepped in, made a bull crap story about how he promotes random channels after browsing the channel to save face, and then contacted twitch to report GiG.  SOE being the larger company with more arm power than Twitch coerced Twitch into banning one of their best late night streamers, thanks to a bunch of pretend butthurt white kids jealous of the donations GiG got from his stream.  I really hope you feel proud of yourself Legion. You turned your mistake into a righteous crusade to save face for only yourself without thinking about the fanship of GiG's stream. But hey, at least people aren't focused on how hacked your game is and how unfair it is for a majority of your players to be combating people they can't even see or fight back against.

Would I want someone like GiG representing me, working for me, playing my game on stream, etc... absolutely not.  The kid is extremely immature and racist with no respect for twitch or any other company.  Respectable people who work hard deserve to stream and entertain others, not someone who sits there worshiping Hitler on stream and allows/joins in on major racism live.

You use the term representing as if h1z1 asked to host him. They never did. They just leeched off his viewers for the website without doing any research on him.

Now every twitch streamer i watch I purely watch only for the game which only keeps my attention for like 5 mins but Gig was one of the only peeps that could keep me watching for hours on end. With Gig being banned every streamer is just too boring and lacks any personality to keep me entertained. Twitch was completely dumb by banning him.   If he was banned solely for racism then that's completely stupid because I've seen multiple streamers with music constantly blaring the ""N"" word.  And if the case was that he was disrespecting viewers then that's even less of a reason. Because even more streamers use that same level of disrespect towards their viewers, heck some even call them and eviscerate them live too. And all gig ever did was put top dick on his channel, which for a a 18+ channel shouldn't be a problem.  I guess twitch doesn't understand that the games bring in viewers but the personality keeps the viewers watching."

You can only hold 6 Pokemon with you at once and all other pokemon that you catch are stored in a pokemon box. This box however has limited storage. Werster didn't remember to switch to a different box to be able to catch the pokemon. He's so upset because you only have one chance at catching that particular pokemon I believe, so the run was basically over at that point."
LivestreamFails,2tmry2,defterade,3,Sun Jan 25 23:39:20 2015 UTC,there are speedruns to catch all 151 pokemon? How long do they usually take?
LivestreamFails,2tmry2,Timmmmel,13,Mon Jan 26 18:13:35 2015 UTC,"This category allows the use of glitches because it is impossible to obtain all 151 pokemon using legitimate ways on a single cartridge without trading pokemon between other gameboy consoles. Earlier runs of this category took 5-6 hours (perhaps longer). These runs used commonly known glitches to, for example, obtain unlimited numbers of certain items (master balls) to have a ~100% chance of catching a pokemon on the first try, among other glitches. Over time more complex glitches were found that could be used to manipulate luck or to force a certain pokemon to appear. The current record stands at 2:23:11 realtime by SheNanagans (October 19 2014), but is likely to be broken very soon due to new routing and even more complex glitches. Here's a vod of the current WR, I added a timestamp to show off some of the crazy stuff that happens during the run."
LivestreamFails,2tmry2,defterade,3,Mon Jan 26 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember that we did the masterball glitch too when I was a kid, it involved resetting the gameboy while saving IIRC, and there was also this missing no glitch that could mess up your game really hard.. But still, catching all the pokemon in that little time is insane, thanks for the vod."

LivestreamFails,2sur33,Calpack2007,81,Sun Jan 18 19:09:01 2015 UTC,"Explanation for those confused:  B0aty found a Harry Potter Distorted track on YouTube and started to troll other streamers/friends with it. He might ring them up and blast it through the mic or he might set it up so that he donates asking for them to listen to a new tune and it's that instead.  So B0aty has been bragging for a few days about how he started the trend and he hasn't even been hit by it yet. He recognises the link and he even got a couple times where it was put into a different video for him and he still realised he was about to get ""Harry Potter""'d.  So B0aty uses a RuneScape client called ""Runeloader"" that's created by his friend, Harry. B0aty has a special beta version with different features to the actual release. Knowing this, IanSpam (B0aty's friend / streamer) and Harry (Runeloader creater) put in a sound-file that they could play remotely into B0aty's Runeloader client.  They waited for him to start bragging about not being caught by it and then activated it, resulting in what you saw in the video."

LivestreamFails,2stj71,megaderek2011,5,Wed Jan 21 12:33:31 2015 UTC,"A straight flush is the best hand in poker.* It's very rare, which makes it all the more absurd that virtually every movie that features a poker tournament will end with the protagonist winning via straight flush.  First of all: in case you don't know, ""your hand"" in Poker (specifically, Texas Hold'em - the variation featured here) is five cards taken from any combination of your two personal cards and/or the five community cards visible on the table.  That said...A straight occurs when your hand is five cards in sequence. In this example, it's 5,6,7,8,9.  A flush is when your hand is composed entirely of the same suit of cards. In this example, it was five spades.  A straight flush is when you have both simultaneously. As you may guess, it's exceedingly rare and, as mentioned prior, is unbeatable except by a higher straight flush (and the odds of two players having an SF are astronomically low.)  '  *Some pedants will argue the Royal Flush is the best hand, but that's just a straight flush with the highest possible cards."

So what happen was... they had a set of matches in Utlra Street Fighter IV once online.. Low Tier God got bodied 20-6 or something like that... and got salty about it like he ALWAYS does when he loses... and attacked Viscant in a Youtube video that he posted on Oct 18th last year.  And well.. Viscant found out about it and holy fuck he went IN on him.  I mean.. he WENT IN HARD and he called him the fuck out HARD.  But because Low Tier God is a bitch, he refused to play him for money but had no problem making phsyical threats of violence at all, so someone backed him so the match would take place.. because Viscant does NOT play for no money.... It was complete bullshit that Low Tier God couldn't man up and money match Viscant... he flat out refused...  So you can thank whoever the hell decided to donate his 200.01 dollars to Viscant pretty much.  And then here's the entire match with the trash talking/pop offs and everything.  This match took place at Super Arcade in Walnut, CA  You are welcome.  And thank you Viscant for putting that piece of shit in his place.  EDIT: This is Low Tier God in a nutshell & If you don't believe me that he deserved the pop off's from Viscant, well... credit to Ippp but this might change your mind.  He also won multiple awards among the Reddit board called Kappa (Kappa does mean the same term as the one on Twitch, but the reddit is predominately just Fighting Game Community Drama stuff) and he won multiple Kappie Awards this year for his behavior.  He even won 5 Kappie Awards... and none of them are flattering ones.  Worst FGC Member  Worst FGC Joke  Best FGC Joke (For when Viscant went in on him on Twitter)  Blowup of the Year (For when Viscant went in on him on Twitter)  Fuccboi of the Year  He also was the runner up on  Stream Moment of the Year (When Viscant popped off on Low Tier God after the match)  Saltiest Moment/Player (When he got desperate for a verbal comeback and pulled out the race card, saying he was just mad at Viscant because he called him A Black DSP/DarkSydePhil)  So please don't defend Low Tier God's actions.  The bitch can never man up and admit when he is in the wrong ever.  He's a cancer to the FGC has been a joke/fuccboi in the FGC way before Viscant blew him up on Twitter and then IRL.  He just simply got what he deserved, and that's called karma.  And once again.... Thank you Based Viscant.  EDIT Again: I WANT TO MAKE THIS CRYSTAL CLEAR. You probably see alot of people dickriding Low Tier Fraud in that match, we actually have lost a lot of respect for those people in the Kappa Reddit board... even the man announcing.. who is Alex Valle (and keep in mind this man is no scrub.. he's a legend and one of the greatest American fighting game players in Super Street Fighter II Turbo of all time, and was once very solid with Ryu in Street Fighter IV)  So with that said... THE MAJORITY OF US IN THE FGC, DO NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM WANT A THING TO DO WITH LOW TIER FRAUD, AND ANYONE IN THE SOCAL AREA THAT WAS DICKRIDING HIM. PERIOD.  Infact on the Kappa Reddit board we have zero respect for anyone who likes him.  He is hated SO MUCH there that even being his friend will blacklist you.  However can we show some love to 2 Time Evo Champion of Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix & the best Zangief player in the world in Ultra Street Fighter IV named Snake Eyez? He's the chilled black guy who got in between Viscant and Low Tier God so they wouldn't actually hurt each other... he's one of the nicest and most humbled people in the community by far.  I use to play on Xbox Live with him back in 2009/2010 period just as he was starting to learn Zangief in Super Turbo HD Remix."

LivestreamFails,2qs4uy,theStroh,43,Tue Dec 30 07:25:47 2014 UTC,"The players involved are BigTymer (who you see in the video) and his two teammates Nadeshot and Scump (the loudest one in the background, the ginger). They were all members of a competitive Call of Duty team known as Optic Gaming, and lived together in a gaming house in Chicago.   Nadeshot is a very large Youtuber, and so he had been playing a lot of Minecraft on the side with other big Youtuber's such as Syndicate. He fell in love with a game called TNT Run on Hypixel's sever (large server, he's in the game watching them play in the video). In this game mode, there are several platforms each with a block of TNT under each other block. As you walk on a block, it gets destroyed. If you fall through all the floors, you lose.  The three of them all being competitive decided to compete with each other at this game mode. It became a fairly routine event, and they would often wager $5-10 on the games. This game was for a much larger sum of money I believe, I guess $180 each from the video description.   It's not ""real"" rage, it's like when you get mad at your friends for hitting you with a blue shell in Mario Kart. They're all very good friends, but Scump is known for having some way over-the-top reactions in rage and in joyous moments. He's fairly arrogant, but he's also one of the best CoD players so it's not without good reason."
LivestreamFails,2qs4uy,SatanIsLove,2,Tue Dec 30 07:55:17 2014 UTC,I still don't understand what's going on.  Why is he mad at the other guy because he fell off?  Wouldn't that be his own fault?
LivestreamFails,2qs4uy,Gnadalf,2,Fri Jan 9 21:46:02 2015 UTC,"Well, rage. The guy you see right before he slips down has actually already stepped on the block the ginger guy is about to step on, that's why it disappears. The ginger gets mad because in his mind the other guy ruined his run."
LivestreamFails,2qs4uy,ben7005,-25,Tue Jan 13 01:22:53 2015 UTC,Look I get what your saying but personally I don't think it's ever justified to be arrogant.
LivestreamFails,2qs4uy,theStroh,18,Tue Dec 30 08:08:32 2014 UTC,"Well regardless of your opinion it was stated as part of the context, because that is what he's like. It's not really important whether or not it's justified. However, if you really wanted to discuss it, I would say it's okay in limited situations. Scump thrives off of being arrogant. When he makes a big play and stands up and yells to the crowd, ""I'm the best in the fucking game!"", he's being arrogant because he's not literally the best player in Call of Duty. However, he sure plays better when he gets in that mindset.   His arrogance is important in the context here especially because he doesn't really play Minecraft while BigTymer and Nadeshot had been playing a lot recently. Scump has the attitude where he believes he will be great at whatever game he plays. His first game of TNT Run he was talking so much about how he was going to be the best, and he ended up winning quite a few of the games the three of them played. He may be arrogant, but it gives him confidence that helps him perform better."

LivestreamFails,2quq9t,lolthinh,-8,Tue Dec 30 23:14:57 2014 UTC,"Yep. I remember when I was a teenager, about 15 years ago, I spent my summer at a computer arcade playing Counterstrike, this was probably when it was still in Beta.  There was an older guy we nicknamed ""Enraged"", he was probably in his 40's, and he was hanging out with 14-20 year olds at this arcade. The dude would throw massive hissy fits if someone headshot him, claiming they were cheating, on a LAN game, on rented computers none-the-less. So one day my friend who was maybe 16 tells this guy to fuck off. Enraged threatens to beat up a 16 year old, to which my friend doesn't back down and calls him a pussy man child, and that he's happy to go out front and beat his ass. There was a small scuffle and some pushing, but it was my friend being the aggressor to this man who deserved it and asked for it for a long time.   Looking back, I'm just flabbergasted that this 40 year old talked so much shit. I'm even more amazed the owners didn't just ban him from coming back to the store, but the owner was a manchild himself and couldn't be 'aggressive' to anyone.   But I got into a fight over video games too. I was 19, stationed in North Dakota while in the USAF. The air force opened a ""Airmen's Center"" that was stocked with pool tables, Xboxes, and other fun stuff. One night these 3 guys from communications come in and want to play Halo against me, 2-on-2, then 3-on-1.  I'm fine with that, I was undefeated at Halo, and while playing 2-on-2 I'm beating the shit out of the other team, like 25 to 0. But one guy starts talking mad shit, just offensive shit to his buddy who he is beating, then starts talking shit to me after he kills me once. So, I start talking shit back, and the dude freaks out. He throws down his controller and jumps me. He didn't know that I fought regularly, so we scuffle for a bit and I pin him down, then security forces walk in as I'm fighting off his two friends.

LivestreamFails,2quq9t,fidelitypdx,2,Wed Dec 31 01:03:22 2014 UTC,IT'S MAHVEL BABY!
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,fidelitypdx,2,Wed Dec 31 05:26:53 2014 UTC,This guy has a history of violence and should be banned from all events. Here's an article about one of his more recent exploits.
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,kyzabro,-2,Tue Dec 30 23:16:09 2014 UTC,"Seriously, the gamming community needs to police their own shit. It's like the other day I chimed in a thread about guys who were not actually competing but collaborating in tournaments. How the fuck do the organizers not take care of their own competitors? Do they not bother to check and see if the competitors have references?  How the fuck is this guy not just universally banned from competing?"
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,fidelitypdx,0,Wed Dec 31 01:02:55 2014 UTC,"That's refreshing to hear. It's not like competitive gaming is new, so I imagine there's established leagues that do have tight tolerances."
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,SuleyBlack,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:56:19 2014 UTC,How the fuck is this guy not just universally banned from competing?    We ask ourselves this question every time he gets brought up. Here's some more reading for you relating to the incident.
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,kyzabro,0,Wed Dec 31 04:34:52 2014 UTC,"Another question: how is the organizer of these events not just mocked when they put them together?   I mean, accountability should fall on multiple people here. I can easily imagine a class-action law suit by the players to the organizers for letting in someone they know was violent. But, I guess that's entirely repudiated within the sad gamer community. It's just amazing. The people I run with, Noel would have been shot, murdered, on his second offense. Guy is a violent psychopath who sucker punches a dude in a leg brace and beats his girlfriend. It's amazing."
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,SuleyBlack,0,Wed Dec 31 01:19:06 2014 UTC,"While I won't ever condone what Noel Brown has done as a good thing, he is an active member of the fighting game community. Since his ex does NOT participate in tournaments she would have zero reason to be there while he would have the greater reason for going since it's a source of income for him."
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,kyzabro,3,Wed Dec 31 01:32:31 2014 UTC,it's a source of income for him.   That would require him to actually win something first.
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,SuleyBlack,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:12:46 2014 UTC,The article did mention he won the 3v3 tournament and before the issue of him assaulting his ex he was a sponsored player. After the incident his sponsor dropped him and not sure what he's been doing since.

LivestreamFails,2quq9t,kyzabro,0,Thu Jan 1 00:19:58 2015 UTC,"Because the incident in the previous post did not happen during the event, it happened after the event shut down.  While he did attack another person at an event in the video above, it's clear in the video that he was being provoked."
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,fidelitypdx,0,Thu Jan 1 01:03:01 2015 UTC,"It's clear in the video that he was being provoked.   In what way is a guy standing off to the side shaking hands with another dude provoking a sucker punch? The dude leaped from a chair and punched a guy who wasn't looking.   I'm not 100% up to speed with this dude, but considering his shenanigans are well known, this isn't the 2nd incident, but one of many."
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,kyzabro,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:08:37 2014 UTC,On top of that in what universe is provocation an acceptable defense?
LivestreamFails,2quq9t,fidelitypdx,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:29:50 2014 UTC,"""Fighting words"" but those usually have to be directed specifically at an individual, specifically to illicit a violent reaction. Not all states have fighting word defenses, but in my state, if I said ""I'm going to fuck your mother"", you could punch me, and a decent lawyer would get you off by claiming the force was necessary because I was engaging you in disorderly conduct in the second degree or harassment. If one purposefully intimidates another person, i.e., ""I will fuck you up"", much more harm could be done to them. If I said, ""I will fuck you up, faggot"", then hit you, it would be a felony in my state."

LivestreamFails,2qok6h,Jai_Guru_Deva,3,Tue Dec 30 22:46:43 2014 UTC,"Yeah they are good at that and sometimes it's hard to tell, but there are moments when you can tell it's genuine. Like, in the Unboxing Ring videos I can actually hear the thought process as they try and improvise a skit live that starts from nothing and all of a sudden things are dying and someone bangs on the shutter or throws something into the set or pretends to have had a scooter related accident to keep the thread going. Things like these seem more genuine and immediate and sometimes you are just having a bad day, like when Shawn is pissed because the podcast is running long. This seems legit to me."

Tournaments are about competing at the highest level, not fucking around on someone else's stream so you can split the prize money.

In fighting games lag is an absolutely horrible issue and it makes an entire session pointless. If this guy is playing ranked i can totaly understand his rage. I don't play street fighter though so i don't know if this is ranked or if there actualy is a reasonable bit of lag but if it's anything like smash bros or mortal kombat 30 ms is far too much to play.  Also don't see why you'd upload a video like this of yourself...

The principal characteristic of voyeurism is that the voyeur does not normally interact directly with the subject of his/her interest, who is often unaware of being observed. The essence of voyeurism is the observing but may also involve the making of a secret photograph or video of the subject during an intimate activity.  The term comes from the French voyeur which means ""one who looks"". A male voyeur is commonly labeled as ""Peeping Tom"", a term which originates from the Lady Godiva legend [citation needed] However, that term is usually applied to a male who observes somebody secretly and, generally, not in a public place.

I'm sure everyone in the speed running community is well aware about the situation with Cosmo during his TWW run, but for those who aren't in the know, basically one of the most popular speedrunners in the world did the same thing to a person commentating his run and blamed the commentator for him not achieving a world record.

LivestreamFails,2p8gdl,Fractura,9,Wed Dec 17 17:47:21 2014 UTC,"For those who can't see what happened (because it's pretty hard to catch if you don't know what you're looking for):  At 02:01:10 he accepts a trade containing most of his TF2 items, but with a CS:GO weapon in the middle. The weapon in question is a rare AWP Dragon Lore, likely the most expensive and rare weapon in the game aside from knives.  Screenshot where the AWP is marked: http://puu.sh/dKOib.jpg  Bottom line: Do not accept trades where you have to give away own stuff without verifying what you give away."
LivestreamFails,2p8gdl,teious,20,Sat Dec 27 03:07:17 2014 UTC,Why is he entitled to have it back? Did the other guy con him into placing it on trade?

To get these cards you either buy packs and unpack them, or use dust to create them. Using dust to create cards is very inefficient. (For example, it takes 8 commons to make 1 chosen common.) Obviously, people want to be more efficient and get the new packs. Some people complain that the UI is too complicated and leads to people being confused about pack.   Here are some links that show other people who have done this:  http://www.np.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2ooktk/first_misplay_of_gvg/ http://www.np.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/2ooihr/warning_if_youre_buying_gvg_packs_double_check/    Based off of the threads, the UI is either too complicated or people are too careless."

When Blizzard released new cards in the past you unlocked them with regular packs.

(yes I know this wasnt the first, just using it) what a loser!  Before serious gaming, before affordable gaming, there was sports and such, that was the cool thing to do.   Gaming started out as a solo thing or at very least 2 to 4 people, this meant you were either alone or part of a small, very small group playing these games. Girls were not into it for the majority as it just was not popular enough.   Once the gaming world became more open, more mainstream and thus more saturation, more people picked it up and especially now, you can play games with who ever; When I pick up Call of Duty, if I play a match, back out and go to a new match every game for 24 hours, meeting upwards to 5000 people that day is reasonable so its no longer a loner game.   TL;DR: Big game titles, Saturation, Mainstream and affordable brought in more people and now you can find a console in most homes."

LivestreamFails,2onhg7,Cole_the_Kosmonaut,3,Mon Dec 8 17:16:48 2014 UTC,wait I can't tell what's going on. so a guy places one of his camps in the other guy's base. the guy either is force to build troops to destroy the camp or lets the camp be built. what happens if the camp is built?
LivestreamFails,2onhg7,lolthinh,4,Mon Dec 8 16:26:34 2014 UTC,Protoss (which is the race the red player is playing as) has an ability on the Mothership Core (the floating orb thing you see) that turns the Nexus (camp as you called it) into a giant cannon for a short time. If that happens it's basically game over for the Terran (race of the green player) player.  The green player is upset that the red player did this and wasn't set far behind. So when his all in failed he gets angry and rage quits. Hopefully that helps.
LivestreamFails,2onhg7,JL235,0,Mon Dec 8 16:38:04 2014 UTC,wasn't set far behind   so you're telling me the red player was able to make a winning play early on in the match like this without being punished? do you think this is balanced? how can you beat this?
LivestreamFails,2onhg7,fishesbishes,27,Mon Dec 8 17:11:54 2014 UTC,"The build that Huk did is not that common in tournaments because most professional players know how to beat it. Avilo also did shut it down and was ahead. So it's totally balanced.  The reason he complained about Huk not being behind is because after Avilo prevents the nexus from building he grabbed all his troops and the workers too, and then moved them across the map to attack his opponent. Pulling his workers means the attack is a bit stronger but ruins your income. This is known as an 'all-in', a bit like going all-in in a poker game. It's do or die, if the attack doesn't win then you lose.  The attack didn't work.  What Avilo did is a really bad reaction to what Huk was doing, Huk saw it the moment it left Avilo's base giving him tonnes of time to prepare, and even if it hadn't of been scouted so early Huk would have still probably been fine.  It's pretty trivial to shut down Avilo's counter at that stage of the game.  So the tl;dr is that his workers stopped working, took a trip across the map, a third of them die, and then they march home back to work for nothing in return."

LivestreamFails,2onhg7,Huwaweiwaweiwa,8,Mon Dec 8 21:53:03 2014 UTC,"Then why not pull less SCVs and build bunkers in Huk's natural? Why not do the all-in lined up with medivacs coming out so the sentries become a non-issue?

LivestreamFails,2onhg7,Huwaweiwaweiwa,1 point,Wed Dec 10 02:51:40 2014 UTC,He was set back but not nearly as far as the green player anticipated hence why he went all in. In the video you can actually hear the casters talking about how the green player handled the red player's play very well and was now in a good position. Instead of using his advantage properly the green player goes all in with his SCV's (ruining his economy) and essentially throwing the game away.  I don't play SC2 much any more and wasn't very good in the first place but I believe the proper play was for the green player to set up a contain on the red player while expanding.
LivestreamFails,2onhg7,_pupil_,1 point,Mon Dec 8 17:15:41 2014 UTC,"Either that or try and hit a timing with medivacs and/or stim, hell why not a contain and that. But you're definitely right, the SCV all in was a terrible decision"
LivestreamFails,2onhg7,Swineflew1,0,Wed Dec 10 02:54:07 2014 UTC,"The twist with the play is that the red player (Huk), didn't actually finish building his building, so it only cost him 100 minerals a minor investment.  It was a feint towards an expensive early attack, but he didn't commit.  The green player had a passable defence but over-reacted after the building got cancelled, gave up on income and a long-term strategy, and sent his workers to attack.  Green expected a quick win from this, but lost due to his over-committal.  In hockey this would be the goalie diving after a deke...  Beyond newbs and casual players (like me), no one is losing to this tactic.  It's balanced, but some poor analysis (Huk lost 100 minerals, not 400), and a poor ""all-in"" reaction from green caused him to lose.  That said: starcraft has lots of ways to win/lose almost as soon as the match starts.  The balance is that failing to win off an early commitment should leave your opponent in a dominant position."
LivestreamFails,2onhg7,Dynamiklol,5,Mon Dec 8 19:59:20 2014 UTC,He lost more than 100 minerals. The entire build time of a nexus ties up a lot of minerals.

LivestreamFails,2onhg7,theNAKAMI,2,Tue Dec 9 08:23:36 2014 UTC,wtf is happening
LivestreamFails,2onhg7,Huwaweiwaweiwa,9,Wed Dec 10 02:47:34 2014 UTC,"There is a strategy in SC2 where a protoss player (Huk) can build a main base building (nexus) right next to the main base (command center) of the terran (Avilo) opponent. If this base finishes building, then an ability can be activated on the base that turns it into a very powerful cannon. This is usually game ending as this cannon just kills everything.  However, Avilo successfully stops the strategy by preventing the nexus from finishing. This was a large investment by Huk that failed, putting him behind compared to the terran player.  What happens next is that Avilo greatly underestimates how ahead he is, and decides to go for a strategy where you pull all your workers from mining resources, and bring them with your army to attack the protoss player. This is what's known as an all in, since if the attack fails all your workers are dead and it's game over. However, this can be a very strong attack in some instances. Avilo's attack does fail as Huk is able to create a force field on the ramp into his main base, cutting Avilo's army in half and allowing Huk to deal with the weak workers separately from the stronger marines.  Avilo then proceeds to insinuate that the balance between protoss and terran is off, and that protoss is stronger than terran, even though he pulled most of his workers from mining resources and lost a lot of them, and lost some mining time with the remaining workers."

As someone who is full of rage most times, it's hard to explain to someone and most times you end up just hating people in your life that care and taking it out on them. Nonetheless, I am not here to whiteknight some guy playing BF3 but shit, hope he gets some help with that."

LivestreamFails,2oeva9,Element7AB,-1,Sat Dec 6 13:32:04 2014 UTC,"Nah, that's not it.  The kid obviously has serious issues and is using BF3 as avoidance (getting bullied).  This is nothing new.  His Dad makes an offhand comment about his cursing, in which he was justified.  The kid who was still mad decides that his built up anger and frustrations can easily be vented on his Dad.  His father and him have clearly had altercations before, and due to the fact that the child is venting and not listening to reason, the father has no choice but to use the ""police"" trump card to get him to take a step back.  At which point the kid is embarrassed that he's causing a big enough deal to get the police ""called"" on him, and does truly worry about his future, so he pretends he doesn't care about the consequences in order to continue his tirade.  He will most likely continue this as far as he can until he truly believes that his parents will do something about it.  I'm sure they have tried to help him and I'm sure he will get the help he needs eventually but all that angry energy he's emitting isn't going anywhere near the right direction."

LivestreamFails,2ng1tr,SkoobyDoo,-66,Mon Dec 1 11:23:32 2014 UTC,"Infestation (warz was renamed) is actually not a terrible game for what it is, which is a different game from dayz.  The problem with it is that the developers are (or were, i think the game has changed hands in the past few months) complete morons, change drop rates and all kinds of stuff on complete whims   (one week body armor is everywhere, like 95% of all spawns, next week everything is canned soda. The sorts of things that are definitively not just random chance, and they just flatly say they haven't changed a thing, vehicles buggy as shit, not fixing obvious bugs, etc)  they also have (had?) ""developers"" who are basically just kids who stream the game and cheat in their own items and hand them out to their friends (best gun in game, VSS, one shot kill on any body part including hands/feet, completely silent outside of about 10 feet, 20 rounds semi automatic with a sniper scope, 100% accurate hip fire)  Hacking and duping were also really prominent, but this is a category where dayz definitely has no leg up.  I had about 250 hours into dayz mod when I got into warz (at the time already named infestation:survor stories), and went on to put ~300-400 hours into ISS. Looking back at the time spent, dayz was a lot of walking around and not a lot, but when things happened it was pretty damn epic. ISS encounters were about as common (though just as easy to avoid if that's your thing) and much more fast paced in terms of ratio of time spent wandering to time spent interacting with other players. Note that just like in dayz, 95% of encounters are KOS.  And now the sketchy part. Towards the end of my playing ISS before I got burnt out on it, a friend of mine came up with an esp program he wrote. I guess people these days are calling it wallhacks? it's basically just a program that overlays over the game screen and shows you a little circle (like a waypoint) where someone is, how far they are, and what weapon they have out. Yes, I know it's cheating blah blah whatever.  Part of the reason why we used it was because of how often we were certain people were cheating. Experiences like we're in a building see someone run in, and then the exact same person drops off the roof into our room and kills us from behind. What we learned from using this to observe people from a distance is that around 30-50% of players use jump hacks to get over walls and onto buildings, including onto buildings you cant otherwise get to. Extremely common to join a server and turn on the esp to see snipers on top of the skyscrapers (about 100+ meters outside of the highest thing you can otherwise get to) in town. On top of that, it's really common to be walking along in a town and get into what my friend and I deemed ""ESP battles"" where you and another person have absolutely not at any point had LOS to one another, nor been in sound range, and yet you're both dancing around walls/buildings and reacting to each others' presence to get a kill. Basically, nearly 100% proof that the other person has ESP. that happened, no joke, about 95-99% of the time.  After about a week or so of playing like this, and once it became clear to us that nearly everyone was using ESP and as many people were using fly/jump hacks, and some scattered autoaim experiences, it became clear to us that the game was fucked and we stopped playing. That doesn't mean we didn't enjoy the time we played where we weren't cheating and we were none the wiser, but in the end, it eventually became clear that pretty much everyone in that game cheats and it's really something the devs should do a better job of stopping people in a game where finding someone and killing them could rob them of hours of looting (though because ISS has a bank, it's more like robbing them of the last person's gear they looted, since they can just hit the bank and load back up).  Sold off everything in my bank for ~$200 and haven't touched it since. Neither I nor my friend have expressed an interest in firing up the game to investigate the cheaters: the impression we had of the devs at the time was negative enough to not warrant a second chance. But I will say that we enjoyed most of the time spent playing--not a lot of dull moments if you know what towns to check out.  TL;DR game wasn't actually that bad once they fixed the early problems, but cheating is wildly more prevalent in the game than any game I've ever bothered to analyze for cheating (which I determined by cheating)."
LivestreamFails,2ng1tr,legacyofblake,15,Wed Nov 26 18:24:07 2014 UTC,Game is and was and will still be forever just a horrible game.  And devs are indeed streamers who got contacted and they now give items away indeed (spawned in items at that).  Artemis knives is one of them

LivestreamFails,2ng1tr,legacyofblake,2,Thu Nov 27 04:15:47 2014 UTC,"Well you can't really enjoy the game with cheaters.

LivestreamFails,2ng1tr,alcoslushies,83,Thu Nov 27 01:00:33 2014 UTC,I like to play video games. I am a father of 2 baby girls. They and my wife are the largest of priorities above all video game playing and streaming. Sometimes I'd rather play video games than take care of a crying child. But you know what? I love my family and I won't sacrifice my relationship with them over a stupid game. I admit when I got married and kids came I had to make some major changes to my gaming habits. But in regards to my relationship they were for the better.   This guy is an idiot and has his priorities messed up. For the sake of the kid I hope he gets his act together.
LivestreamFails,2ng1tr,Clitaristocrat,40,Thu Nov 27 02:53:09 2014 UTC,"Yea I don't think any one around would RATHER deal with a sobbing child than play video games, but, ya know, the whole point of being an adult in a relationship and functioning as a member of a family is that sometimes we all agree to do things we don't really WANT to do because that makes the family unit...work."
LivestreamFails,2ng1tr,Zorkamork,5,Thu Nov 27 02:57:37 2014 UTC,You're totally right on that front. No it's not fun dealing with a crying child and of course you'd rather do other things than deal with a child who just won't stop crying. But honestly that child's needs have to come first before video games. I don't care if you're streaming to make money even. People put their families above their jobs all the time if the situation calls for it.

I've seen 'pro' (in the sense that they get paid and seem to have that at least a part of their income, not like I do their books or whatever) streamers with babies right next to them and junk. The simple fact is pro or casual it's still a videogame, there's plenty of moments when you can go 'woops, baby's crying' and handle that, especially in this case where it's not even like he's a single dad, just that his wife needs a couple minutes to brush her dang teeth."

It was $600k.  Attach your paypal to a bank. When it hits $15k drop it to $5k.  Make that a regular thing. You'll have enough to cover normal expenses, chargebacks, etc. but you won't be risking your big bucks with a company that pretends to be a bank but actually isn't.  Don't be lazy about this either.

LivestreamFails,2n0503,DrCakePan,10,Sat Nov 22 19:34:40 2014 UTC,"Money changes how people act around each other.. or at least most people. For example, if you were in charge of paying a group of people and one person got double the amount for no more effort than the other people in the group, you might look at him differently than everyone else in the group. Some people might feel entitled to the idea that they deserve more than what they're making if they see the other person making double the amount.  It's not a matter of dropping his paycheck at work, it's a matter of his viewers seeing him differently from now on. People are greedy mofos and the moment they see big numbers they assume some people just got all that dough instantly instead of the 3-year build up that he's been doing this entire time.  Although an even bigger fail is keeping everything on paypal instead of a bank. Paypal is garbage and the moment they freeze his account it's all gone. /u/psisyndicate put it in an actual bank."

LivestreamFails,2n0503,cruelynx,2,Fri Nov 21 20:33:15 2014 UTC,"Yeah even ""smaller"" streamers are. I know of some partnered streamers with <15k followers who are making $10k+ a year just off of Twitch. Expand that to the more popular streamers and you can imagine how much they're making.  Of course a big part of that equation is how many subs per follower--and there's not a consistent formula or percentage to guesstimate that for the average streamer, but they can earn a lot. Also donations are a big thing too. If you go watch a big streamer's Twitch it's not uncommon for someone to donate them $500 or even $1000. In fact based off one very big streamer (>100k followers (<250k though)) I watch regularly who chronicles his top donators each month I know from ONE PERSON (generally a different person each month) he gets over $500--every month. Based off his donation rate from other people too I'd guesstimate every hour he streams he earns $20-25 just off of donations. Add subscriber money and ad revenue... and that's a helluva lot of money each year from just Twitch."
LivestreamFails,2n0503,saintsudden,-4,Fri Nov 21 18:40:44 2014 UTC,I have nothing against the guy in the video but 78k from 3 years of youtube and streaming is not that much. Especially if you consider he probably spends more than 8 hours a day streaming and editing videos.
LivestreamFails,2n0503,SpazzyBaby,12,Tue Nov 25 05:24:57 2014 UTC,If you ACTUALLY believe that he has saved every single cent for 3 years in that account you are really stupid.
LivestreamFails,2n0503,Nickalollyoff,7,Tue Nov 25 13:20:15 2014 UTC,78k sitting in his paypal account. There's a difference between how much someone has earned and how much is sitting in your bank.

LivestreamFails,2n01tr,MacGyver_Survivor,9,Fri Nov 21 19:46:19 2014 UTC,"I watch a few streamers when I can catch them. All of them are YouTubers I know with some 50,000 subscribers, who either never use facecams or use them only once every six months or so when playing a horror game, and who focus on the game and give either insightful commentary if it's a game their proficient at (for example, a speed runner explaining how a particular glitch works, like most of the regular AGDQ/SGDQ guys) or are just funny as fuck.  Yeah, a lot of people watch these other streams where a guy or girl's cam takes up 75% of the screen, banners and shit take up 20%, and 5% is a tiny screen of them playing a basic Hearthstone deck  or wandering aimlessly with a trial character in WoW, while they practically beg for donations (or, in some 'girl gamers' cases, just straight-up get their tits out for - which, don't get me wrong, is totally rad, but Twitch isn't the place for that shit). They bot for viewers, rage or whine for money and followers, and would really be better suited to bugger off to BlogTV or something and drop the pretense of having anything to do with gaming (which won't happen, because there are 'gamer' streamers who make more money than all of us put together).  But, some people do like it, just like some people watch reality TV. No, I don't watch it, yes, it's inane and scripted as fuck, but some people just like it.  I've been subbed here since day dot, and I've noticed the livestream fails are less 'fails' and mostly just /r/cringe-worthy streamers. Old matey potatey in this video may have handled it like a right dickhead, but he had a point. If I choose a stream at random, there's about a 50% chance that it'll just be some guy or gal ranting at the camera about their day and begging for subs.

LivestreamFails,2msdk3,Jai_Guru_Deva,3,Thu Nov 20 13:23:17 2014 UTC,The problem with that is that the whole point of MOBAs is teamwork. Once you get past the lower tiers of play you have to start communicating with your team or else you'll get obliterated.  It's pretty much either play through the ragers or only play with friends.   I do insta-mute/ignore someone if they're raging though and just go on communicating with the rest of the team.

As far as how much he makes he gets thousands of dollars every time he streams and ive watched him pass it on by donating thousands of dollars himself to other streamers.

LivestreamFails,2m5ye5,vcc0m,7,Thu Nov 13 20:15:12 2014 UTC,Most of those big donations get charged back on PayPal. They're used to most of them being trolls so they probably just ignore them untill they found out they're legit later on.

He customized it so when people donate money to him his character skin alongside the lion king music plays on screen (because of all the music he could have chose he chose the lion king song for some reason?).   He was being raided which is when one streamers tells their viewers to go visit someone elses twitch channel for the purpose of saying a message, harassing them, or just mess with them (although usually done with good intentions many times the people being raided will thank the person who sent them for the extra viewers and publicity).  The people coming from the raid began donating with obscene or funny names knowing that he reads the donation out loud on stream to thank the donators. Hilarity insues as the donators won't let up. The streamer handled it rather poorly and acted childish even though he was making a good amount of cash."

LivestreamFails,2j097x,Krayzed896,11,Mon Oct 20 03:15:55 2014 UTC,"I don't know... I feel pretty bad for the guy to be honest.  He actually wanted to prove his words with actions and I can respect that. He got down on the floor and tried really hard doing those push-ups.   Yes, he passed out and pissed himself. THAT, however, is not normal. Passing out after a few push-ups isn't normal, even if you overexert yourself and make your muscles go bust. He went for full-force blackout, pissed himself, and was completely disoriented after he woke up. Not something that should happen.     It seems like he has some kind of medical issue (whether he was born that way or is that way due to substance abuse) and I feel really sad for him.  If I were one of his viewers, I wouldn't think any less of him after this. Yes, he is a show-off that talks big and doesn't really have much to show for it. But I knew that before he pissed himself. Just listen to him, nobody cares about that, he most likely is entertaining and that's why people like him. That he pissed himself really was an accident and he did it while trying to prove himself instead of only pretending.  When I was in the army I saw many men fail spectacularly at things they claimed to be the ultimate pros at. But hey: At least they tried and weren't just talking without actually showing us the truth."

Basically it is a gamble that a player can make, they fire off some rounds at an area as soon as they round a corner in the hope that an enemy player is waiting there.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  Also see stuff like people throwing grenades etc. at specific times or points of a map without knowing for sure that they are going to hit someone, its a gamble that experienced players make in the belief that at least some of the time they will catch a player with it."

A mate of mine attended last AGDQ and said it's an even split between regular guys/gals who just speed run the games they love, and cliche socially awkward gamers and fedora-wearers.  He maintains the only reason speedrunning isn't considered 'nerd cool' or 'le geeky' is because it hasn't been featured on that Big Bang Theory show, so you get no hipsters and the like at the events. The events are still refuges for a lot of gamers and viewers who get a huge amount of their social interaction through streaming.  S'all good either way, and it's for a great cause which we should all support - but also explains your question."

So why did you spend it all inside your room, spending hundreds, thousands of hours playing the same thing over and over, getting mad and frustrated when you mess up. It's the definition of insanity.   I think they are fun to watch once to see how they did it, but damn. I wish I spent my youth years more wisely than in front of a t.v. plugged into a wall.

Getting stronger has improved my life outside of the weight-room over the last 4 years. More than say, spending my entire summers are a teen in highschool playing WoW, instead of socializing with my friends. All it rewarded me with was a face full of acne and loss of a lot of weight. Also, loss of friends.  I used to love games as a kid, but I see how spending an extraordinary amount of time on them is damaging. The real world is out there, and it's full of shit a game can't give you. Hell, life is a game. An experience. The problem I'm posting about here is that to be a speedrunner, you have to devote more time than one ever should to a fantasy. Real world is out there.  As a finisher, I usually cant help but notice that these people who speedrun often get mad at the games they are playing, frustrated, and lose their shit.

I'd like to say that I don't do bodybuilding; bodybuilding is a vanity sport that ruins it for the rest of us.  Anyways. Perhaps I as a person am just too different to understand it from their point of view now. I look at it as a complete waste of time because I feel like it takes away from our purpose in life, which is to progress spiritually [to learn how to deal with different aspects of ourselves]. The roles we play in life are a lot like a video game, except the video game is so limited.  Hobbies, outside of playing the same game over and over, have a certain uniqueness to them that allows you to always experience something new. However, literally repeating the same actions over and over. You aren't learning anything new. You are replaying old experiences.  I myself love to experience. I currently can play several instruments, I like to read and I like to learn. I am not trying to say I am better than anyone else, because I am not, but what I'm trying to say is that I have lived both the world of gaming and beyond. Garnering what wisdom I have, I see how staying indoors all day playing video games obsessively deprived me of living.  It is hard to express my opinion through language alone and not experience. Same with one not being able to hear my tone, or see my facial expressions. I never meant to put down the hobby, but to merely point out that I see what it does to people. I see people get angry at the game, break things, ruin relationships with their families, neglect important matters.  Perhaps it depends on the individual, because we are all insane. Insane in our own way.  Thank you for taking the time to write to me. I sincerely apologize for coming off as negative."

If he were to play the game on an ique his game time would of been around 18:15 or so seeing as an ique is about 15 seconds faster.  Last I heard he's getting an ique, so who knows."
LivestreamFails,2gtpzm,thecacti,1 point,Fri Sep 19 17:49:12 2014 UTC,"It's different however. The reason the ique is faster is because AFAIK it doesn't drop any frames, specially during cutscenes.

The fun of pulling off that frame perfect trick, or killing that boss in optimal time, or going outside of the map to skip a cutscene, all culminating in a Personal best time. Dedication is key, and the feel of a new Personal Best time is exhilarating. And each game is different. One speedrun may rely on proper strategy when fighting enemies, or properly judging distance for that long jump, or maybe finding a way to fix a mistake on the fly. It's a very diverse playing field. Speedrunning adds the fun of playing the game in an interesting way, that takes understanding of the games mechanics and how it works, and knowing where those items are.    That's what speedrunning is about. /r/speedrun"

LivestreamFails,2gm3ah,DoomKey,9,Sat Sep 20 10:04:30 2014 UTC,"The opponent hero had more board control by far, basically meaning they had much more of a damage output to this streamer's hero. The card the streamer really wanted to play, Deathwing, reads ""Destroy all other minions and discard your hand."" It is a very situational card, but in this specific situation it was a dream come true. If the opponent Mage had not ""topdecked"" the heavy damage-dealing card ""Pyroblast"", (aka happened to draw the exact card he needed, meaning it was on top of his deck) the streamer likely would have won. The reason they may not have anyway is because, to put it really simply, the Mage had a minion that when it dies, it puts a random secret from the deck in play, many of which could have potentially screwed this guy up."

But I must admit, there are so many outs for a mage that it's hard to believe he really thought he was going to win. There's still a secret out for the mage, and the mage could've had a polymorph or, as it seemed to be the case, a pyroblast. Even a fireball would've killed him , as it could've been combined with a fireblast.  On the other hand, he might've just been annoyed at the fact that not even his deathwing could help him against the inevitable pyroblast."

During portions of the UHC event, people were able to donate while also choosing items to give to certain players in the game.

I'm in college and there are a metric fuck ton of people who have these really small channels with quite poor content. Everyone in my age group thinks it's so easy because they all have games consoles/PCs, recording software and mics. But that's not what it's all about. I don't see the point in aspiring to be a Youtuber etc any more either way, there are now so many that they're over saturated and it's ridiculously hard to come up with original content that people want to watch. There's now a good 100 or so channels for each specific game and taste with at least 100,000 subs. Some with upwards of 10s of millions.   I'm not saying don't have ambition, but people chasing this dream and removing themselves from reality has seriously affected their performance in school, causing them to begin failing etc. I have friends who now take extra days off to record and edit something they've been working on for months on a channel with less than 100 subscribers.  And the worst thing? None of them do it for passion or love of gaming/recording.  They just do it because they want to be rich and ""famous"". It's holding them back from reality and they get frustrated when they release some montage they've been working on and slaving over for months, only to get ~200 views with vigorous advertising. They take it out on their friends and work.   Everybody wants to be rich and famous, but only very few are going to get there and only very few are willing to actually work for it."

He was popular around the time Let's Play became a budding video genre (though it had been around long before). He had hundreds of thousands of subscribers and would post like 10 videos or so a day. They were all pretty funny and he wasn't absolutely terrible at gaming like he is now. His blog ideas were funny and being that he had a job you could tell he didn't give a shit. The best part was that there was never a face to his videos. Then he started filming himself and then he lost his job and turned Youtube into a fulltime job. He was still funny for a bit of time and his V-logs were kinda funny but it was getting a bit out of control having 30 videos a day in your inbox. Every videogame video around 2010-2011 had around 3-5k views each and then his video updates would get about 50k-100k views so he was doing well when it came to views. Then his main channel got shut down, opened up a buncha different channels and moved to Blip. Then came back to a new main channel and fans just didn't have the time or energy to keep up with what the hell he was doing. It wasn't funny anymore, it all seemed really desperate.   This is all coming from someone who had watched him back in early 2009 through 2011 because he was genuinely not shit back then. But after listening to him try to make youtube work, then moving to Blip and being fired form Blip for racism, and then defending said racism, yeah it became hard to like him once he started really showing his personality. Now he just mindlessly drifts through youtube producing an obese body of content."

LivestreamFails,2fq5jw,herkaburger,3,Thu Sep 25 20:11:15 2014 UTC,I hate LoL and most mobas. I've never been able to get into any of them because of how bad the community is. I don't want to continue to play a game if I keep getting shit on by my own team mates. In my opinion they have the worst communities and sure their are some great people playing but I feel like most people are assholes.
LivestreamFails,2fq5jw,pman8080,2,Thu Sep 25 21:20:03 2014 UTC,"You'd be right. Like, take roles for example. In LoL, you can be a top lane tank/bruiser, a mid lane mage, or one of two bottom lane roles, which are support, Attack Damage/Ability Power Carry (although most people do AD carries), and lastly there's jungle, who's the guy that floats around killing stuff in the woods, and coming from the shadows to help kill people.  Now, there are other ways to play, like roaming. You can just mull around the map, and pretty much add an extra person to any lane, but whenever you say you're going to roam, all four of your team mates get unimaginably butthurt, and say they are going to report you. Funny thing is, Riot throws out all reports of people breaking the ""meta,"" because you're allowed to do what you want, if it's productive.  So, once you tell these people it won't matter, and that Riot has a rule saying it won't matter, they dissolve into calling you a ""faggot nigger cunt,"" and either start intentionally feeding, or trying to get the other team to report you as much as possible as well. It's completely ludicrous."

LivestreamFails,2fk6er,HunterKitsune,27,Sun Sep 7 01:49:34 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure how great this video really demonstrates anything. If you watch the cat portion, you'll see they clearly did a lot of things differently, the most obvious being that the stranger played with the cat the entire time, including when the lady came back into the room. Another big difference is that the cat DID notice the person leaving (you can clearly see the cat turn their head and watch the person leave the room).   But besides that, they're completely different animals, and it's ridiculous to even begin to compare how one animal behaves next to how a completely different animal behaves. Dogs are pack animals and cats hunt alone.  Obviously one person's conjecture doesn't prove anything, but I own cats and the cats adore me. They run up and rub up against my leg, and then they'll run away and face directly away from me, as if they're testing me to see if I'll run up after them. If I don't, after a while they turn around and come back up to me so I pet them. Cats and dogs are just completely different animals, and if you raise a cat to be a loner (not cuddling them or holding them or introducing them to other people) then yes, cats can get angry and swipe. Same with dogs though, I believe."
LivestreamFails,2fk6er,QUSHY,16,Sat Sep 6 03:08:29 2014 UTC,"Great experiment. A sample size of what? One cat? Yeah that proves a lot. Anyone who has owned a few cats knows that they all have different personalities. I have owned cats that were terrible pets and did nothing but harm, but i currently own a really good cat that has never bitten or scratched me, is quite intelligent (can open doors), and is an all around great pet. I know for a fact he has some attatchment to us because he's extremely affectionate and friendly, yet shy around strangers. If i have company over, he generally hides and eventually comes out and comes to me. There's also shit like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx14ohE6nHs that proves your video wrong. They have very good memories. They are hit or miss animals. Either you get a little shit, or a great pet.  The main reason that they aren't all overly friendly like dogs is because they come from solitary hunters as opposed to dogs which come from pack animals, where social skills are vital to survival."
LivestreamFails,2fk6er,AyoJake,-5,Sat Sep 6 20:05:57 2014 UTC,"I wasn't saying that cats were attached to people, and your same statement can be said of cats... Most cats would not react this way. A cat doesn't have to personally love you to not want to hurt you. You could say that cats generally avoid attacking people because they don't want to ruin their only source of food. Being attached is irrelevant."

Cats do not have the same emotional attachments to their owner as much as humans and dogs do."" In fact, it's a fact that cats can be very close to their owners, a cat can be depressed because her owner is not here anymore,you just can't see it, for example my cat don't eat and panic if she is not with me for a long period of time. But in fact a cat is harder to educate,and if you don't do it, it can be painful,like the video linked.  edit : in fact an aggressive cat is often a cat that don't feel well..."

LivestreamFails,2fk6er,Vogey,5,Sun Sep 7 21:24:31 2014 UTC,I honestly don't think the cat was attacking her intetionally. By the looks of it the cat was trying to catch the side of the chair with its claw and the poor girls face was there. He might have been avoiding her kiss but trying to stay on the chair or just generally playful. The body language of the cat doesn't seem to be aggressive before or after the strike.

I had a dog that was the sweetest thing, but if you put your face in her face and got too close, she would nip at you.

Under New Hampshire's Offensive Conduct law (chap. 378, para. 2 of the NH.

It's a restricted area, and he could have walked into a part that had less security, he could have asked to see the person in charge (which seems most likely, being that he wanted something turned down according to the statement the host made), ect.   The point is, there are a lot of ways for someone to get into a restricted area like that, and I don't think that coverage of people talking about video games at a video game event is as important, to some, in comparison to events with actresses and actors everyone knows, so security could be worse.

Now, we have kids who have this superiority complex because they know how to hide their face behind a screen and proxies, virtually letting them do things like this without any consequences. It's stupid, and programs like Skype, and other VOIPs need to enact a feature where calling emergency services, or the police station in general, can't be done.   You don't need to use Skype to call if you need help, pick up the house phone, or even a cell phone that has no service, because they can still make emergency calls.

There is no way he didn't know calling him an idiot would escalate his mood and the overall situation, and expecting him not to react would be akin to expecting someone to not react to your offense because you hastily left the room you were arguing in. Worse yet, he did it in front of an audience, selfishly involving them in the conflict and putting even more shame on the idiot without leaving a reasonable way for him to react. despite this, instead of taking the events in stride and having fun with it, he disdainfully disparages the idiot from his exalted position, and drama happens from his difference.

LivestreamFails,2evb6h,PM_ME_YOUR_PLOT,6,Fri Aug 29 03:00:59 2014 UTC,"I think the problem might be that they aren't sure whether the trailer is playing somewhere or if they are still on cam. They see that the cameras are still filming them but there should be a trailer running.  So they keep quiet in case the trailer actually is running (and they just can't hear it) but try to act thrilled in case they are still on cam (without exactly knowing what they should do as it's not in the script).  So, they can't talk and are just awkwardly trying to cope with it."

There is usually a light on top of one of the cameras that indicates if the feed is broadcasting. Usually it only takes a few seconds to switch to the other footage, and the hosts are supposed to look at the camera until they aren't being broadcasted anymore. They were probably staring at the camera anxiously waiting for the light to go off. As the seconds dragged on, they were unsure of what to do. The people talking to them on their headset probably weren't helping much either. As a result they sat there staring at the camera awkwardly.

LivestreamFails,2dxg49,Apf4,2,Tue Aug 19 05:20:22 2014 UTC,"EDIT: Made a TL;DR  TL;DR - This guy annoyed me, and the word ""Toxic"" should result in the person using it being berated for using it, because it's no longer holds the same meaning as it used to.  This guy makes me upset. His voice, and inability to listen to his friends advice. He could of held still, like his friend said, and when Trynd left he could have follow HIM. But I guess not.  You know what I hate? I hate how ""toxic"" is a term EVERYONE uses now. Like, it was relevant the first few times it was used, but now it's just another one of those terms people use to describe anyone doing anything wrong now, or someone has a legitimate gripe, and they're ""toxic.""  Like, someone does something silly, like a support initiating, and you say ""Hey, please don't do that when I am not there"" you get called ""toxic,"" and you're reported.  It's like people using the report button as a vindictive way to outlet their rage. Not because they actually did something wrong, but because they are mad that they are playing bad, so obviously it's everyone else's fault, so he should smash the report button after calling you names and saying you're the toxic player.  League is not a game I would recommend to people. It's way to trashy now."
LivestreamFails,2dxg49,herkaburger,77,Thu Oct 2 21:37:13 2014 UTC,LoL definitely has one of the most toxic communities I've ever seen. Maybe it's because I don't play and I only see its community via twitch/youtube videos from time to time.
LivestreamFails,2dxg49,Dynamiklol,29,Mon Aug 18 23:16:50 2014 UTC,you are correct...it seems like mobas attract people with negative attitudes.  I enjoy playing with my friends in ARAM but those games are generally ~20 minutes so if someone is negative I don't have to play with them for long
LivestreamFails,2dxg49,brobrogadget,23,Mon Aug 18 23:59:50 2014 UTC,"It's because it's a highly competitive TEAM-based game. If there was anything a single person could do to win a game when the rest of his team messes up, it wouldn't be as rage-inducing. But that is compounded by the fact that the game is a grind unless you pay real money for unlocks. If you lose, you aren't getting many points at the end.  It's as if it was made for the sole purpose of crushing each and every man's soul who plays it. The original mod may not have been, but it also didn't have grinding and unlocks. Even HoN had a box price with full unlocks. LoL was clearly made to raise the suicide rate in the world.   Also, the fact that LoL has THE biggest community of any other game, it will absolutely have the most toxic community by default, regardless of the game type because of the sheer number of players. It probably also has the biggest population of nice gamers as well, but no one ever brings up stories about that.  A lot of games end up leveling about, because after the trolls have their fun, they leave the game to the people who are dedicated to it. LoL just doesn't end, is constantly updated and just gets bigger. The toxic players will never leave."

Obviously those 2 didn't make up 100% of my matches but the rest is such a small part that I might as well not even name it. I kept playing because I didn't have much else to do, but now that I started playing Dota again I find it harder and harder to come back to League."

LivestreamFails,2dxg49,gitykinz,1 point,Wed Oct 29 01:28:42 2014 UTC,"It's not false. I don't have any issues with their F2P model, nor do I think it's Pay to win or unfair, but it IS a grind. Period. You have to do hundreds and hundreds of matches to unlock a decent amount of characters, get decent runes etc. So when you lose a match that your team was doing good on, except for one person, consequently causing you to get even less points, it is going to make you angry at them.   Now, no one should ever rage like the guy in the video, ever, but it is understandable why he was mad. The system is designed (though unintentionally) to do that.  For the record, my ""unless you pay real money for unlocks"" was just directed at being able to buy characters. Which there is nothing wrong with, you are completely missing my point and focusing on the wrong thing. Runes are still a grind, but buying the characters you want heavily cuts down on that grind."

LivestreamFails,2dxg49,FreeToDoAnything,6,Tue Aug 19 01:20:13 2014 UTC,Back in the Dota 1 (Warcraft 3 map) days I knew a couple of people from the clan who punched holes in their walls when they raged hardcore. I played LoL and Dota 2 for a couple of years each and it's all the same toxicity. The communities in the MOBA genre are the definition of toxic.
LivestreamFails,2dxg49,vcc0m,3,Tue Aug 19 02:16:58 2014 UTC,"To be honest, I played a lot of both (currently Dota 2 only as I left league shortly ago) and Dota 2 isn't NEARLY as bad as LoL, or atleast not in South America (LAS in LoL)  I mean people insult in Dota as well but not nearly as much, and you don't get 'trolls' nearly as often. I did not play Ranked in League though, maybe the environment is a bit better there."
LivestreamFails,2dxg49,Reggiardito,3,Tue Aug 19 23:38:04 2014 UTC,"Well, DOTA has a good system for reporting which puts troll players with other trolls really quickly."
LivestreamFails,2dxg49,gu3st12,2,Thu Aug 28 05:54:25 2014 UTC,"Games against bots aren't too bad, but if you get into a game where it's 5 real players vs 5 real players, you're probably going to get yelled at. Whether someone can't believe that ""OMG you think you can solo top with Nautilus"" or in-game they start yelling at you when you have 1 kill, 6 deaths and 7 assists saying that you are ""feeding"", it can get very annoying. The word ""feeding"" is confusing because that kind of insists that you're purposely helping the other team while at the same time they could defend themselves and say that's not what they mean (even though they do).  You will very often enter a lobby and within 10-15 seconds one guy is yelling ""WTF"" and saying ""n00b faaggot"" with two A's because you can't say ""faggot"" and get past the word filter. It's a great game but the safeguards on chat don't make sense. I think you can say ""fucking"" but not ""fuck"". You can also say ""fuuck"" or ""fuckk"" or any other variation.  And if you run in to help someone who's about to die, and kill the enemy, they yell ""OMG KS"" meaning they think you did a kill steal. From my view it's a team game, and any time you find people that thank you for helping out you can bet your ass you've found a great team."

The hamburger I ate last night certainly didn't try to be consumed, but it sure as hell fed me.

LivestreamFails,2dtczv,pvtfish,-25,Mon Aug 18 01:33:52 2014 UTC,If it was 60 fps it wouldn't look like a movie.  See criticism of the Hobbit.  The game looks like a movie because of 30 fps.
LivestreamFails,2dtczv,iiRockpuppy,9,Mon Aug 18 01:44:39 2014 UTC,30 fps vs 60 fps
LivestreamFails,2dtczv,IOnlyLurk,11,Mon Aug 18 01:51:03 2014 UTC,"Yeah, 60fps is just objectively better, in movies included. Intentional 30 fps lock ""because it looks like movies"" is an absurd argument. It doesn't look ""cinematic"", it looks stuttering compared to 60 fps."
LivestreamFails,2dtczv,iiRockpuppy,-7,Mon Aug 18 02:01:36 2014 UTC,"It's an aesthetic choice.  Declaring one ""objectively better"" is just silly.  30fps is still plenty fast to not look ""stuttering.""  The human brain doesn't work that way.  A combined side-by-side  of simply text like the above is a misleading comparison because your brain will adjust to 30fps when it fills the entire frame.  It won't look jerky.  It instead takes on a different visual feel associated with film.  I mean, do you go to the movies and sit there thinking ""Wow, this is so jerky!  They should really increase the FPS!""  If so, you are a rare exception."

LivestreamFails,2dtczv,iiRockpuppy,2,Mon Aug 18 02:28:14 2014 UTC,Why are you comparing two vastly different technologies? Are you stupid?   What movie projects at 30fps? Have you ever played a game that was 24fps? Of fucking course not. And you know why? Because it would look like shit to play.
LivestreamFails,2dtczv,Osego8,2,Mon Aug 18 04:13:46 2014 UTC,"I'm not taking sides, but don't you think there's an important difference between a consistent, deliberately imposed 30fps and 24/30fps as the result of a system struggling to run the game?  Personally, I suspect that framerate consistency is more important than peak framerate which it comes to how immersive a game feels, but if you have the technology to choose a framerate then what makes it so different from film/video?  Television and move producers make those sort of choices all the time, and no one argues that it's stupid and pointless and that there's one ""objectively"" correct answer.  Everyone can see that digital video shot at 60fps has a different look and feel than 32mm film shot at 24.  Why is this suddenly a debate when it comes to video games?  Is it just because people are used to flashing marketing materials from GPU makers boasting higher frame rates?"
LivestreamFails,2dtczv,JordansEdge,2,Mon Aug 18 06:27:50 2014 UTC,"Sorry, this is going to be a long post, it's hard to explain and some of the more technical aspects have been talked about in depth elsewhere:  Because gaming is an interactive medium to begin with.   Also films that have tried to make the move to a higher fps have been criticized for doing so due to a number of reasons, mostly because people felt it was like watching a television show due to the fluidity, some going as far as to say it made the special effects and sets look ""fake"" as though you were watching a making of rather than the film itself. Some even reported feeling more motion sick because of it.  To answer your question I really feel like it's because PC gaming has hit such a such a plateau of popularity in a strangely different light.  I mean if you go back a decade Console games were largely in their own ""little"" bubble, there was such a huge divide between Consoles and PC gaming that it was never like a ""war"" between them, they both had their rightful place.  Fast forward to when the 360 and ps3 came out and to me it always felt like it was trying to muscle in on PC gaming's market, things like FPS Games, DLC, Online Gaming, Patches and even attracting a strong indie market. Finally it was also about the spectacle, which I really don't remember being such a huge deal from the last generation of consoles (as much at least)  I really don't think the FPS argument is because of GPU marketing schemes, it's just as consoles slowly becoming neutered PC's (not necessarily a criticism) and information is widely available these sort of complaints come to light far more easily.  I agree that consistency is far more desirable than a higher number, which is why Console games are at such a low FPS, however personally I think people who claim FPS makes no difference have not experienced the other to make a valid claim.  I'll give you an example, most competitive PC gamers back in the day would play on CRT monitors, and even to this day still do (I still do for FPS games). Why do such a thing? Because the refresh rate would go 120hz+ which makes for a far more fluid looking and responsive experience when paired with games running at 120fps respectively.  Most monitors and TV's do at least 60hz, it would make sense to match that.  The easiest way to explain this is by looking at side by side examples and you'll see what I mean by the fluidity. It works for games because there is no illusion to break, and because it's a largely interactive medium it just feels right.  http://30vs60.com/  Watching pixels move across the screen your brain immediately picks up on the jerkiness of it at low frame rates. While you might have gotten used to it, I assure you, if you played games at 60fps for a while, 30fps would irritate you slightly. (especially if you're playing the same game)  Sorry, I wish I could sum it up easier.  TLDR: It's because games are an interactive medium, and there's no illusion to break. The only reason why this is a debate now is because consoles have been muscling in on PC's territory and as a result people are now wondering why they can't compete graphically.  Watching film and watching TV is so different because TV uses higher FPS, if you use the same FPS to shoot a film your brain can feel there's something off, it makes you feel like you're watching TV or a making of and everything feels a little more fake."
LivestreamFails,2dtczv,FLAMBOYANTORUM,1 point,Mon Aug 18 07:11:36 2014 UTC,"It works for games because there is no illusion to break   But doesn't this depend on the type of game you are playing?  Sure, for an online, competitive FPS it makes perfect sense to have the highest frame rate possible, but suspension of disbelief is obviously a factor when it comes to things like survival-horror titles such as Silent Hill so couldn't a lower FPS, closer to the one we're used to seeing at the movie theater, be a viable option aesthetically?  I feel like it comes down to what people actually experience.  Maybe it doesn't make any difference, but if someone were to tell me that Silent Hill locked at 30fps feels more immersive/cinematic I couldn't argue with them.  I do wonder if the game studios have actually looked at this in focus groups or anything.  It'd be interesting to have some real data."

Maurice was in the ghetto and Sky became best friends with him. He's been doing shit like this fora long time now and recently he took a phone from somebody else in the house read through all their texts and when Sky found out it was Maurice that did it he told him to go into her room and just put it back and he (Sky) wouldn't say anything about it. This came after sky covering a lot of Maurice's wrong doings. He went in there and told her that sky took her phone and read through all the texts. She (temporarily) turn on Sky saying how bad of a person he has while he had no idea of what happened. He found out what Maurice told her and sky had finally had enough of Maurice's bullshit. He kicked him out and the rest of the people in the house understand now. Sky is now somewhat scared of what the others in his house could do. He was Maurice's friend for around 5 years and he tried to ruin Sky's image for no reason. Now Sky may or may not be moving out soon to completely focus on making videos.

One example is missing calls, how do you get those if you just mute everyone? And yes there definitely are a fair amount of trolls and assholes, but you can selectively mute them after it's obvious their intentions are not to communicate in a decent fashion to you. Even then I hesitate to mute because believe it or not a lot of these guys will still try to communicate unless they're the lowest of the low."

I can't tolerate very many streams for long because they always lack SOMETHING. Some pander too much, some are hilarious but lack anything else, some are awesome at a game but have no personality. I don't know where I fit, I just know that watching me play a game would probably not be so entertaining. I do play League but I'm Silver level.

You have to really pull ahead to carry a game by yourself. Otherwise, it's a team effort and half of the people don't want to be team players. I'm not saying that I blame my team every game, I really am a pretty average Silver V player and I can't carry myself. I belong where I am. However, there are a lot of really good players who get held back because of this. It is frustrating when every other game, there is that one guy who is either a troll or thinks he can make all of the plays themselves, which ruins the game for the whole team.   TL;DR you have to rely on your teammates more than individual skill. Teammates are not always team players."

Now I understand making YouTube videos can be demanding and a lot of effort but is he being serious? The guy is a complete moron, and now he insults his entire fanbase watching and supporting him and punishes all of them because of a select few.

LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,non_troppo,3,Tue Aug 5 00:12:07 2014 UTC,To be honest speedrunners have the least anger issues out of all gaming subtypes. You have to have a lot of patience to sit there and run the same game over and over and over and over for thousands of hours.
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,LordOfTheLemon,2,Fri Sep 19 03:02:35 2014 UTC,"For these in particular, there's a lot of RNG (random number generator) involved. So you can get easily frustrated by things that should, in all probability, go your way. Or you could get to the very end and it all goes wrong. For RNG speedruns, it's kind of like gambling with your runs until you get the perfect run. So if there isn't a lot that is in your control, it can be pretty frustrating."
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,praxadox,-21,Sun Nov 2 18:58:21 2014 UTC,There's a special kind of narcissism that accompanies the delusion that people will literally pay to watch you sit on your ass and play video games that tends to go hand in hand with anger issues
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,LordOfTheLemon,11,Sun Aug 3 10:59:53 2014 UTC,"Eh, not really. It's just that people who do get paid to play video games will tend to take the games more seriously than your average person, hence the frustration."
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,braulio09,2,Sun Aug 3 11:09:48 2014 UTC,"I don't know that this really applies here, though. /u/Eshetun was referencing ""every speed runner"" and /u/non_troppo specifically referred to speed runners ""delusion(al)"" enough to believe they will be paid for their efforts. I agree with your point wholeheartedly as it is a perfectly logical explanation as to why paid speed-runners would react in such a manner. However, it does little to explain why the other 99%+ of speed-runners who, though unpaid, react in much the same manner."
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,ButterNuttz,1 point,Mon Aug 4 04:11:25 2014 UTC,"Well, whenever someone gets really invested in something, whether or not they get paid they get frustrated when they're not doing well.  Have you ever been to a Little League Baseball game? Tons of players and parents lose their shit over something that essentially means absolutely nothing. These same kind of emotions can be manifested in practically any other hobby, especially one that is competitive. Now that may show a lower level of emotional maturity, but I don't think it has anything to do with delusion or narcississm per se."
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,Notsdlog,15,Mon Aug 4 04:24:53 2014 UTC,"why is he pissed for losing that run? It was only 9 minutes in, wtf"
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,nzieser27,25,Sun Aug 3 05:13:02 2014 UTC,Because it takes like 30 minutes to get the right starting stats on your Squirtle. And since speedrunners often don't use save states they kinda just have to start rerolling starting stats over and over again everytime they fail their run.
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,Laihoard,4,Sun Aug 3 07:30:24 2014 UTC,Your pokemon start with random stats?
LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,foairdfvadr,9,Sun Aug 3 19:16:35 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know the exact stats but a google search can probably fix that.

LivestreamFails,2cg4sp,aeroheadvg,3,Sun Aug 3 20:16:15 2014 UTC,"They start out with a random nature. Natures will  improve one stat by 10% and lower another by 10%.

He would restart because Squirtels are bulky and not speedy so that nature would hinder his best ability and improve one that is pretty much useless to him, since the base speed stat is so low to begin with."

LivestreamFails,2ael6p,VintageSin,1 point,Fri Jul 11 06:13:16 2014 UTC,"Sure, but it's not accurate.  After hearing that, someone might download a registry cleaner like CCleaner, but it won't do anything to find rootkits.  A rootkit can hide registry entries to conceal its operation, but it is not inside the registry itself."
LivestreamFails,2ael6p,CheezyWeezle,0,Fri Jul 11 16:12:16 2014 UTC,"To be fair, I did not know what a rootkit was a few years ago, I still tech. dont know what it is beyond, a ""virus"" type thing thats in the registry.   When Virus is used like that, its mostly a blanket term, kinda like how we give the blanket term ""Animal"" so saying a Bear is an Animal is technically correct but more correct would be calling it a Mammal.  So in this sense we would see it like...  Virus | | Worm----Trojan----Bloatware----Browser Hijacks----Rootkits----etc.  Then, in those subcatagories is probably a vast amount of even more sub catagories if possible..   Does that help you understand why people say that to people who havent heard of more defined definitions? Virus is a catch-all for the uninformed.   Now, if you want to help people, there are places on reddit where people like my self go to to learn, If you wrote a detailed and ACCURATE description of each type, average ways of catching, symptoms(usual), and easy ways to get rid of, even I would be more than happy to upvote it and read it (with sources)"
LivestreamFails,2ael6p,TaylorWK,1 point,Fri Jul 11 06:23:10 2014 UTC,"ok, how about ""It's a sneaky virus"". There.  It's not the 'virus' part that's wrong. It's the rest. A virus cannot be in the windows registry, since none of it is actually executable. The executable part of the rootkit that is critical exists on the actual filesystem rather than the registry, and thats the part you'd want to get rid of that first, since it could just revert registry modifications.  in other words: it's a virus, but it lives in the filesystem like all viruses, not the registry."
LivestreamFails,2ael6p,klumpp,-3,Sat Jul 12 00:46:48 2014 UTC,"A virus certainly can be in the registry. When a program calls a register for data, it reads this data and will execute any data needed to continue. This is how a virus can infect an existing program, rather than being its own program, because it puts its code into the registry of system programs, and when those programs are used and call on an infected register, malicious code is executed.   It's hard to detect these viruses because most AV programs will see the system registers and think ""Yeah, those should be there"", and will skip them to save time. That's why a rootkit scan takes longer, because it looks at a system register and thinks ""Yeah, that should be here, but let's just make sure it's the right thing"", and that's how it detects rootkits."
LivestreamFails,2ael6p,MoocowR,1 point,Sat Jul 12 01:57:52 2014 UTC,Viruses can use the registry but are not in the registry. A virus by definition is a self replicating malware that creates it's files repeatedly.   A r
LivestreamFails,2ael6p,Dynamiklol,1 point,Thu Jul 17 04:18:25 2014 UTC,"If you're executing data from the registry, that's a huge problem already. That's not what it's for. It's for storing values. Execute things from the filesystem. Not that executable code stored in the registry is automatically considered a rootkit anyway. Again, it's just a sneaky virus.  If you mean it'll read a filepath and execute whatever is at that, well then the antivirus could just... find and remove the malicious executable that it's pointing to, without needing to look at the registry."
LivestreamFails,2ael6p,nthman,-1,Thu Jul 17 04:48:12 2014 UTC,"When code is read, it is executed, automatically. In order to read the registry, the registry code must be executed. In order to find a file path in the registry, the register that holds that path must be executed in order to read the data. Registers hold values for things, and can hold values for anything. When notepad saves a file, it looks at the registry for default document values. This includes sharing policies. A virus can make the default values have all saved files shared to a proxied server that the virus maker controls. Now all the documents you save that you think are private are sent to some random person. This is hard to detect, because AV programs might think that is normal. Of course, registers can point at files, too, and this in and of itself can also be very hard to detect.   Viruses can make a virtual hard drive that is just a few megabytes big, but separate from the main drive (i.e., C:). When you start a virus scan, it asks which drives you want scanned. By default, C:\ is selected. However, this tricky virus isn't located on that drive, so a scan won't find it. The virus can make the location of the drive hidden and not assign it a drive letter, making it completely invisible unless you go into Disk Management or something else that shows partitions, such as Parted Magic or DiskParted.  The registry could also hold small instructions for when doing something. The drive could be disabled by default (Completely invisible to everything), and when the register is read, it changes the value of the state of the drive to be ON. Then, a few lines down, it points to a file on said drive. Then, at the end of the register, it changes the state of the drive to OFF. So the register is read, the drive is turned on, the file pulled from it, and then the drive is turned off.   Source of knowledge: Years of IT work and IT cetification. I've encountered and removed many viruses."

LivestreamFails,29xtd3,Haredeenee,0,Sun Jul 6 06:08:23 2014 UTC,The live stream community is one ill never understand.   Who wants to watch unedited boring gameplay?
LivestreamFails,29xtd3,JackBread,6,Sun Jul 6 06:23:12 2014 UTC,"Thousands of people. You're not just watching for the game, though. You're watching for the personality. Or maybe it's the education.

LivestreamFails,29xtd3,Dynamiklol,1 point,Sun Jul 6 06:50:54 2014 UTC,"You're looking at it the wrong way. It's a combination of watching a game that you're passionate about and finding a streamer who both knows what the hell they're doing or at least makes it enjoyable (both if you're lucky).   It's not like people watch a 4 hour long speedrun in the hopes that someone rages, they do it because they enjoy watching a game be completed the way they do it. Shits hard, some are fucking astonishing to watch. It's most definitely not for everyone, it's just about finding a personality/game that you enjoy and starting from there."

LivestreamFails,29xtd3,leaptheman,2,Mon Jul 7 01:14:48 2014 UTC,"The prominent cultures in the world do sexualize breasts, of course, but the argument stands for ""no reason but to show off his muscles"". This isn't taken into account though since a special argument is made for men that ""it's for comfort"". Women wearing tank tops or choosing not to ensure their cleavage is fully covered can be for comfort to, but the male dominated Twitch/gaming communities tend to go nuts about women ""only doing it for attention"". Just watch the chat for female streamers as well as /r/creepypms for the types of messages they get on a regular basis. It's nuts."

One, subjective much? Two, he expresses himself by putting out videos just as low of quality, if not lower than what he's complaining about? At least there was some production value in the videos he was ""critiquing"".  We'll go past all of that though, it still doesn't give him any right, to come on to a podcast that he wasn't invited to, interrupt them multiple times, and insult the hosts and the viewers because he doesn't agree with an opinion.   The guy originally invited on the podcast isn't much better either, cause he was kicked from that weeks episode after letting it persist, then went on to social media try to claim he was unfairly kicked off the podcast because ""our personalities didn't mesh"".   If anything, these guys just seem upset that they can't make the videos that bigger channels can, or even come close to making the same amount of money."

His main form of entertainment between games is his e-dates. He finds a random girl on twitch and has his thousands of viewers spam her chat asking for a date. He then proceeds to be awkward as hell.  It is also important to note that the girl he is on that e-date with in the WoW video is one of his best friends who is constantly on his stream.

Not your typical ragequit stuff, but a lot of gold here. They'd play along a lot and come up with really funny stuff after people figured them out like Steven being blown apart by lightning and being put together by scientists in which they had a memorial service to raise money.

LivestreamFails,27v14b,Describe,16,Sat Sep 6 02:43:57 2014 UTC,"If I was to do a drunk stream, I'd get drunk enough so that I was funny and out of it, but not drunk enough to pass out."
LivestreamFails,27v14b,OneTimeIsAll,3,Wed Jun 11 16:09:13 2014 UTC,"I know you posted this a month ago, but I just found this sub, sorry. My favorite version of a ""drunk enough to be funny but not pass out"" is definitely Paperbat's first time getting drunk in his life. He does it with a vodka kool aid mix. it's archived here: http://www.twitch.tv/paperbat/c/4015335 watching the beginning where he's all calm and collected and then skipping in 2 hours when he is just schnozzed is hilarious"

LivestreamFails,27v14b,cl0udaryl,12,Sat Jul 12 09:44:09 2014 UTC,"I wasn't actually looking for this clip, just came across while looking for another one.   A few months ago about 5 or 6 guys were playing Zelda A Link to the Past(?) racing on SRL while drinking. One dude vomited everywhere, fell off his chair and hit the deck for a while vomiting more, got on and then fell off his bed and then like 5 or 10 minutes later reappeared on cam without his shirt off covered in vomit, looking bewildered that his stream was still on during this whole thing.  I can't remember who it was though, anyone know?"
