She could have originally planned for Lucius and Narcissa's punishment to be this -- their son, their only heir and pride, turned into a werewolf.

That's like saying she asked them to kill Lavender brown. The movies are their own. That's how selling rights to a director and company works. There's Rowling with the books and them with the movies.   And to put the nail in the coffin: Rowling did not give them rights over her characters, only the story itself.

harrypotter,3e1uy9,Chocolate_Salad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:55:54 2015 UTC,"This theory is certainly valid but so is Sape being a vampire. I think it's just a head canon thing.

Or, seriously Merlin went to Hogwarts? I know he's a fictional character but I think you should check your dates on that one. His story is usually dated as about three hundred years before the founding of Hogwarts so that one bothered me."
harrypotter,3e2p7h,Zhao16,2,Tue Jul 21 15:42:18 2015 UTC,Maybe Merlin was just from the House of Slytherin? Old Wizarding families probably had some very old roots. I think JK confirmed that many came with the Norman Conquest.

harrypotter,3e2p7h,MaimedPhoenix,4,Tue Jul 21 15:50:42 2015 UTC,"The movies are adaptation of the books. The books are the true cannon and the movies are one person's way to tell the story laid down in the books.

I will always hold that if Lavener's feebly stirring was to lead to death, she wouldn't have left it in the air like that without a follow-up. Lavender is alive, sorry.

harrypotter,3e2p7h,MaimedPhoenix,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"My last argument is that if she is supposed to be alive, why would they put in a scene to confuse us on the status of her life? All they would need to do is NOT show her, and we never would have thought she might be dead."

You expect me to believe that Rowling agreed with making a plot hole like that?   I'm not trying to make you agree, but the books supersede the movies and always will. The books had her feebly stirring which implies she was still alive. If Rowling meant for her to die, she would've followed up on that. What the movie say has very little impact on her real fate.   Alive until proven dead."

harrypotter,3dzb2c,SomethingwithPM,53,Mon Jul 20 19:30:43 2015 UTC,I would think they could keep an eye out for the Snitch and actively block the other team's Seeker until the Snitch disappears again.  Then only try to catch it once their team has enough points to win.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,Alyys,19,Mon Jul 20 19:35:48 2015 UTC,"They could definitely block passes and could probably stop a shot were they to pretend it was an accident (no ref, it just happened to bounce off me!). The rules don't say anything about them not being able to handle the quaffle (at least not in that version),  so it's possible they'd be allowed to carry and pass it so long as they didn't actually shoot for the hoops.  They could also do their best to injure the opposing team. Obviously there's the various sorts of foul (the best would probably be aiming to collide head-on then pulling up at the last second so your broom hits them in the face), as well as not-really-fouls like flying close to them and 'accidentally' side-swiping with an elbow. There's also being a pseudo-beater by flying close to bludgers to attract them towards you then aiming for a group of opposing chasers, with the bludger following you. That would, of course, rely on being unusually nimble even for a seeker, but would be entertaining. Plus, a bludger ricocheting off all three chasers would do a lot of damage indeed."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,spineyrequiem,9,Mon Jul 20 20:47:10 2015 UTC,as well as not-really-fouls like flying close to them and 'accidentally' side-swiping with an elbow.     Cobbing is definitely a foul (although the HP films make it seem like it's pretty easy to get away with).
harrypotter,3dzb2c,tinsmith63,2,Tue Jul 21 02:40:44 2015 UTC,"Eh, cobbling sounds like you have to be deliberately and repeatedly elbowing them to get it. After all, 'excessive use of the elbows' implies there is an acceptable level of elbowing.. A single side-swipe probably wouldn't get you done. I dunno though, suppose it would depend on the referee."

harrypotter,3dzb2c,arahman81,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:46:56 2015 UTC,I just don't see why the opposing seeker would fall for that if they are up by over 150 points
harrypotter,3dzb2c,dirkforthree,3,Tue Jul 21 03:42:15 2015 UTC,In a tournament it matters just as much how many points you win by as it does whether you win in the first place.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,Rodents210,5,Tue Jul 21 03:46:29 2015 UTC,I'm sure they could be generally annoying or draw penalties or some such.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,jmartkdr,7,Mon Jul 20 19:43:47 2015 UTC,But the seeker could join the chasers then? Having an extra chaser should be an huge advantage! and the qualites of being fast and agile should trancend quite well.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,buckybone,9,Mon Jul 20 19:41:35 2015 UTC,They're not exactly known for their durability...putting them in the thick of the action is just making them an even bigger target than they already are.

Can someone confirm?"
harrypotter,3dzb2c,Lorenzo_Matterhorn,33,Tue Jul 21 03:18:27 2015 UTC,"They could also pretend to spot the Snitch and keep the other Seeker from actually finding it, therefore giving their teammates more time to catch up."

harrypotter,3dzb2c,dirkforthree,2,Tue Jul 21 04:08:49 2015 UTC,Krum did that and his team was still outmatched.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,DavenportCabinet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:22:19 2015 UTC,That strategy doesn't make any sense. The opposing seeker would realize that the one pretending to see it has nothing to gain by catching it. He would be just fine with letting the other guy catch it and still win. This is assuming he is paying any attention whatsoever to the score
harrypotter,3dzb2c,lurker628,38,Tue Jul 21 03:48:30 2015 UTC,"Tell that to Viktor Krum. In '94 World Cup the Irish were womping the Bulgarians by over 150 points. Viktor decided he was bored of losing so he caught the snitch even though it meant his team lost for sure. I mean, I get it that there was almost no chance of them beating the Irish, but that was classless."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,DavenportCabinet,5,Mon Jul 20 20:39:52 2015 UTC,"It's directly explained in the books.  It was 17 goals to 1.  Krum did his best to catch the snitch before the Irish pulled too far ahead (successfully getting Lynch to plough himself - twice), but once the Irish were up by 160, it was clear that the Bulgarians weren't going to come back.  It was the opposite of classless - he chose to end the game as best he could, rather than continuing to abuse Lynch while his own team got similarly clobbered to no final effect."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,dsjunior1388,0,Tue Jul 21 03:37:41 2015 UTC,"While I see your line of thinking, and would agree if it were just a regular match, but this is the World Cup we are talking about! My dad scraped enough galleons together to take my older brother and I and we were all three dissapointed with the match."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,WateredDown,16,Tue Jul 21 13:17:39 2015 UTC,"As a sports fan I have a huge problem with that. I know Rowling is on record saying she doesn't know much about sports, and it is never more obvious than right here.   No world class athlete would intentionally lose a national championship game. Especially knowing two scores from his team and a snitch and he can win it. It's such a baffling scenario. It's like Kobe Bryant going to the Olympics and intentionally scoring on his own net, or Wayne Rooney doing the same thing. It's unfathomable, except in cases of deep, deep corruption like gamblers paying him to throw a game."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,dsjunior1388,10,Tue Jul 21 00:38:02 2015 UTC,In those cases there is a clock and honor in battling to the last minute. Quidditch goes on until the snitch is caught. There is honor in recognizing your defeat and ending the game on your own terms. In some games and cultures recognizing you are defeated and conceding is considered a step in maturity and class.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,WateredDown,3,Tue Jul 21 03:26:48 2015 UTC,"No, there is no honor. Not two scores down. Krum knows the snitch is his he knows he can prevent Lynch from capturing it.   By catching it a quaffle score and a snitch down, he's telling his six teammates he doesn't have any faith in them to turn things around or even make a tiny bit of progress. He's telling them he would rather surrender early in a game than believe in his teammates, and that personal accolades are more important than team goals. No honor to be found."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,rixuraxu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:54:13 2015 UTC,Two scores down with the points from the snitch. The gap was only going to get wider. Again in many games without time limits where an opponent can concede its considered poor sportsmanship to draw a game out when the end is already decided in a contest among equals. Seeing the game as lost and ending it with dignity is the sign of a professional.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,dsjunior1388,2,Tue Jul 21 07:16:32 2015 UTC,"It's not common in sports because they simply aren't scored in that way, but if you look at other games like chess, or some esports, it's pretty common to surrender when you know you've lost."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,WateredDown,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:51:22 2015 UTC,"I've been watching baseball, an untimed game, my entire life and I've never seen players intentionally concede defeat.   All he needs is one chaser to grab 10 points and then he gets the snitch, at least walking away with a draw or going to a tiebreaker."

It's one thing for a team to win entirely on their own merit, i.e. Ireland scores all the points and catches the Snitch, when Ireland scores heaps of point but the Seeker fails to catch the Snitch, sure a win is a win but how much does it really mean when the other team's Seeker catches the Snitch."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,mutant6653,4,Tue Jul 21 12:53:26 2015 UTC,"Haha just checked it up, they lost with 10 fucking points! (1 goal) He could atleast have waited given he's team a chance to make 1 goal."

harrypotter,3dzb2c,MinaHarker1897,19,Tue Jul 21 02:07:39 2015 UTC,"Before he caught the snitch the score was 170 to 10. Bulgaria had scored once to Ireland's 17 times.

harrypotter,3dzb2c,teh_maxh,3,Tue Jul 21 02:21:48 2015 UTC,"Damn, that makes sense."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,MinaHarker1897,2,Tue Jul 21 02:37:27 2015 UTC,"That does make a lot of sense, but I'd say wait a little longer until it is absolutely out of reach before conceiting"
harrypotter,3dzb2c,teh_maxh,9,Tue Jul 21 03:46:25 2015 UTC,Krum knew they that the Irish chasers were too good and that Bulgaria were never going to catch up so he wanted to end the game on his own terms
harrypotter,3dzb2c,MinaHarker1897,3,Tue Jul 21 02:13:13 2015 UTC,"You're right, but what's always bugged me is didn't they only need two goals to come within 150 points? Sure, the chasers weren't going to catch all the way up, but they only had to catch up to within 150, which seemed feasible. Krum's logic would have worked better if they were down by more than a few goals"
harrypotter,3dzb2c,arahman81,0,Tue Jul 21 02:33:35 2015 UTC,They were down by sixteen goals. I'm fairly sure that qualifies as more than a few.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,Waterknight94,0,Tue Jul 21 03:40:35 2015 UTC,"Down by 16 means two goals and the snitch gives them the victory. That was my whole point, they don't need to catch all the way up by scoring goals, they just need to get within 150 points. Hence only needing to catch up by a few"
harrypotter,3dzb2c,creyk,4,Tue Jul 21 03:47:40 2015 UTC,"But while they're scoring goals, Ireland would be scoring more goals."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,mo0nsugar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:51:02 2015 UTC,"My point was just that victory was still plausible at that point, so it seems way too early for Krum to throw in the towel like he did"

harrypotter,3dzb2c,dirkforthree,6,Tue Jul 21 17:52:14 2015 UTC,Perhaps that is why some of the longest games in history have gone on as long as they did. Maybe the seeker of one team knew he couldn't win yet so devoted his time to stopping the other seeker waiting for the score to even out.

harrypotter,3dzb2c,hmpsnj,4,Mon Jul 20 20:23:58 2015 UTC,"At Hogwarts, I believe they get House Cup points for every quidditch point. And if I remember correctly, their championship is based on total points across all games, as well. So in those instances, if you're definitely not going to win you can at least do damage control by catching it anyway."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,AaronGoodsBrain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:58 2015 UTC,"Right. If it were the final game and they just had to lose by less than a certain score to retain a year-wide advantage, it would make sense to still catch it if behind."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,hmpsnj,4,Tue Jul 21 03:01:44 2015 UTC,Does anyone have any argument for why the Quidditch rules aren't the worst sporting rules ever?
harrypotter,3dzb2c,AaronGoodsBrain,4,Tue Jul 21 02:23:35 2015 UTC,Quidditch doesn't make a whole lot of sense
harrypotter,3dzb2c,tegtsauce,9,Tue Jul 21 03:39:59 2015 UTC,"It really bugs me that all the scores are multiplied by 10 (10 points per score, 150 for snitch). I can't think of a single real world sport other than tennis that does anything like it. Makes it feel more like a video game than a sport."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,sfzen,17,Mon Jul 20 21:56:05 2015 UTC,"150 just sounds better and more imposing than 15.  And American football counts by weird increments, as does rugby football"
harrypotter,3dzb2c,Feldew,7,Mon Jul 20 22:22:00 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with rugby, but in American football the weird scoring system is totally justified. The point values for different types of scoring all make sense relative to each other, and are at their least common denominators. There is a way to score 1 point, and a 1 point differential in a game actually matters.  None of that exists in Quidditch. Tennis is the only other sport I can think of where the smallest possible interval between scores is greater than 1 (15, 30, 40, love).  You could drop the zeros from the point values in Quidditch and it wouldn't change the sport at all. And in my opinion, it would make it feel more like a real sport and less like a video game."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,Bingbongday,-7,Mon Jul 20 23:28:46 2015 UTC,"In American football you can score 1-2-3-6 depending on the type of score  In rugby you can score 1-2-5, similar to football  Neither one of those scoring systems seem very logical. Tennis does seem the most illogical, I agree with that. The other convoluted scoring system I can think if is bowling  Scoring in Quiditch just sounds better with large round numbers to me. A score of 17-3 doesn't sound as fun as 170-30."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,Feldew,18,Mon Jul 20 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"A touchdown has to be more than twice as valuable as a field goal, otherwise teams would settle for field goals too often, which would make the games less exciting. But, if a touchdown is worth three times as much as a field goal, teams start abandoning field goals entirely, resulting in a lot of wasted drives and lower overall scoring, making games less exciting.  Furthermore, you need to have a conversion that's worth more than a regular PAT kick in order to create more possibilities for ending close games. But, the conversion still needs to be worth less than a field goal or else kicking once again goes by the wayside.  Also, you need a safety to be worth less than a field goal yet still have an impact on the score.  Given those conditions, I challenge anyone to come up with a scoring system for American football that's more logical than the one we've got."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,chakrablocker,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:56:35 2015 UTC,You can't really score 1 point in football. Extra points might be worth 1 point but really they turn a touchdown into 7 instead of 6. It's not like a team can drive down the field in a tie game and score just one point to win.
harrypotter,3dzb2c,tusing,2,Tue Jul 21 02:58:54 2015 UTC,"It's rare, but technically possible. A Conversion safety occurs on an extra point or 2-point conversion attempt when the defense gains possession of the ball (through blocked kick, interception, fumble, etc.) and fumbles the ball in the back of their own end zone. The offense is awarded 1 point."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,ewic,-2,Tue Jul 21 03:21:33 2015 UTC,What? A touchdown plus a field goal being 7 points makes perfect sense. /s

harrypotter,3dzb2c,b__w,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:35:06 2015 UTC,"The losing seeker would want to do anything they could to keep the game going, keep the other seeker from catching the snitch. Remember, the game doesn't end until the snitch is caught. We know one World Cup game lasted five days, which means there's a good chance the score could fluctuate a lot in that time.   If the seeker is distracted by trying to block passes or goal keep, they may miss the other seeker seeing the snitch and ending the game."
harrypotter,3dzb2c,SleepingRegi,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:35:18 2015 UTC,Yea its idiotic for a team to catch the snitch while down by 150.

There were ~30 7th years fighting, maybe 20 teachers (idk how many there are though), ~20(?) members of the Order (keeping in mind that some of them were also teachers), and let's say 30 randoms.

harrypotter,3dzqsf,marzipanrose,2,Tue Jul 21 02:46:05 2015 UTC,Exactly this. I always had trouble falling asleep because my mind would race and work up my anxiety.

Listening to the audiobooks in my hospital bed really helped get my mind off the possibility that I could have a stroke at any second. I guess a stroke could happen at any point, but at that time it was a lot more likely than it usually is.  I don't see how I would have been able to fall asleep without HP. When I had the heart attack, I had already been awake for 22 hours, and by the time I was in my hospital bed, it was around 27. Trying to fall asleep when you are less sure that you will wake up than you usually are, is really difficult.

harrypotter,3dzqsf,craftsy,9,Mon Jul 20 23:49:22 2015 UTC,"I was a very sad, lonely, anxious child. I never believed that people could like me for me. I was often treated differently for how mature I looked at a young age, sometimes good and sometimes bad. Reading HP gave me comfort that no one in real life could. It was something I could use to drift into an unknown place, daydream about when I was worried or scared. Harry was scared when he was going through all that he did. If he could survive, so could I."
harrypotter,3dzqsf,SpaghettiTuesdays23,4,Mon Jul 20 23:59:04 2015 UTC,Definitely. Helped me get my mind off problems at home and school for years. Still helps me deal with stuff that's hard for me. And sometimes it's just a nice way to unwind.

It definitely helped me. Maybe even saved my life."

I just never pictured myself as a reader and always felt that if I had tried to read, I would give up from boredom. But dammit, I wasn't going to quit those books. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that this was a couple of years ago and I'm 27 now. But it also helped that the movies left me with a lot of questions that I knew the books would answer. To this day, I feel that I've gotten over my anxiety of reading."

If it weren't for the books I wouldn't be who I am today. I started reading them when they came out in '97 so they pretty much helped shape me up until '07.

The first thing I did when he was diagnosed with Leukaemia was order him an ipod to give him all the HP audiobooks to listen to while he was having chemo (he loved the series as much as I do). It arrived 3 days later, the day after he died.  I've been listening to the books while I'm driving to and from work every day since he died. I used to speak to my dad while driving home from work so find driving alone particularly difficult. I'm up to Deathly Hallows on my second time through at the moment.   Sometimes I think that maybe I should listen to something else, when people make comments like, ""Are you still listening to these?""... but I'm not quite ready for that yet."

It's stupid but I've always had this image in my mind of Snape arriving in the ""beyond"" and the first two people he sees are Lily and James. After a moment James stretches out his hand and the two men shake hands. Lilly then runs forward and embraces him.  I've often thought I'd like to paint this scene. It would make for quite a powerful image."

Rowling worked on the books she had a certain ambivalence towards death, the after life etc. I'm sure she even said that her thoughts on the matter parallel frequently with Harry in the books. She would flip-flop between no belief in an after life to uncertainty and at times even strong belief.  Edit: I found an interview in which she talks about this subject.  It's quite far down. The paragraph starts “The truth is that, like Graham Greene...""."

harrypotter,3dwsub,4everpurple,24,Mon Jul 20 12:42:33 2015 UTC,What a great catch. This is an amazing detail to see and think about and literally made me stop to appreciate its simplicity and power. Hat tip to you for giving us some new to enjoy about JK Rowling's writing.

harrypotter,3dwsub,YamadaDesigns,21,Mon Jul 20 07:31:00 2015 UTC,"Man, the first time I read the books ages ago, I didn't think she Rowling wrote that well. She created an amazing world that I would love to be a part of, but it was very cut and dry and not really impressive.  I have reread this series at least 8 or 9 times and every time I do, I find something new that just impresses the hell out of me. Some authors I believe we look for symbolism where it doesn't exist. The more I read, the more I believe the placement of every single sentence was deliberate."
harrypotter,3dwsub,ich_habe_keine_kase,19,Mon Jul 20 19:38:27 2015 UTC,"I totally agree...her style seems very simple at first glance, but the little breadcrumbs throughout are what really make her an excellent storyteller"
harrypotter,3dwsub,dylanthegrey,9,Mon Jul 20 19:45:53 2015 UTC,"I love how easy these books are to read honestly, it's hard to find a writing style that is that captivating."
harrypotter,3dwsub,Darkohaku,8,Mon Jul 20 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"You're so right about this.  I was actually an English major in college and switched because I got sick of the over-interpretation of everything.  And apart from the incredible detail and symbolism and foreshadowing she puts in, she is actually a great writer.  Her writing is very plain and unembellished, but she writes dialogue incredibly well and is so descriptive about everything you can visualize it all perfectly.  (She's also funny as hell.)  What's also striking, which because I read them first as a young kid, growing up always only a few years behind Harry, I never noticed until later read throughs, is just how well she nailed the thoughts and actions and manner of speaking of 11-17 year olds.  Going back and reading them now as an adult they really feel like children/teenagers in a way that I think not a lot of authors successfully capture."
harrypotter,3dwsub,TheCodeGuy,15,Tue Jul 21 02:02:43 2015 UTC,"While not necessarily on the subject, this made me think: What if Harry had been more brutally killed (specifically something that would ruin his body: beheading, dismemberment, slit throat)? When he came back to life would that have been healed? If Voldemort slit his throat, would Harry come back to life and die again from the same wound?"
harrypotter,3dwsub,MivsMivs,22,Mon Jul 20 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"I think that in that case Harry would've died for real. It was only because Voldemort used the same wand that belonged to Harry that he survived and only the piece of soul of Voldemort died. In either case the sacrifice would've been made, and Voldemort would have been mortal once again."
harrypotter,3dwsub,YamadaDesigns,16,Mon Jul 20 16:22:57 2015 UTC,I don't think it had anything to do with using a wand that belonged to Harry. Voldemort was able to kill other people easily enough with that wand. I think it had a lot more to do with the piece of Voldemort soul that was in Harry. The spell killed that piece and if Voldemort had cast the spell again it would have killed Harry for real. That's why he had to play dead.
harrypotter,3dwsub,Rodents210,10,Mon Jul 20 16:52:41 2015 UTC,I think the point is that the wand's allegiance was with Harry - it didn't work properly when used against its owner. Though Voldemort could use it just fine against other people. I think all factors worked together in keeping him alive.
harrypotter,3dwsub,YamadaDesigns,5,Mon Jul 20 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"I thought Harry was able to come back because of the way that he approached Voldemort, and the meeting of the ghosts using the Resurrection Stone.  I thought the fact that he accepted and embraced death was the reason he was able to come back from Limbo.  Isn't that the lesson of The Tale of the Three Brothers?  Becoming master of death means confronting Death with no hesitation."
harrypotter,3dwsub,bisonburgers,10,Mon Jul 20 21:02:37 2015 UTC,It was two things:   The Elder Wand is reluctant to kill its true master. This is also how his spell rebounded in the Great Hall.  The blood connection he established in GoF acted like a sort of Horcrux for Harry.
harrypotter,3dwsub,Mr_Lawrence,3,Mon Jul 20 19:41:22 2015 UTC,"I forgot about the blood connection, does that have to do with Lily's charm then working for both of them, or what do you suppose? The fact that Voldemort would recover from it because Nagini was still alive meant that Harry would also live?"
harrypotter,3dwsub,YamadaDesigns,8,Mon Jul 20 22:51:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think he would have died in that case, but Dumbledore knew Voldemort well enough to know that Voldemort's ego and ignorance of magic would prevent him from using anything but the Avada Kedavra - ""That which Voldemort does not value, he takes no trouble to comprehend"". It was Voldemort's biggest weakness for many reasons, one being that it makes him horribly easy to predict for someone as brilliant as Dumbledore."
harrypotter,3dwsub,akameiro,8,Mon Jul 20 17:53:49 2015 UTC,"I think he probably would have been dead for real in that case, but Voldemort would never debase himself so far as to kill Harry in a muggle way. Dumbledore knew that and was counting on it."
harrypotter,3dwsub,capitolprostitute,3,Mon Jul 20 18:04:14 2015 UTC,Imagine if Voldemort just pulled out a Glock and shot Harry several times... how anti-climactic.
harrypotter,3dwsub,KolbyKolbyKolby,4,Tue Jul 21 02:11:40 2015 UTC,yess I was wondering the same thing re-reading the end of DH. Maybe if his body was unusable his soul would latch on to another living thing and act kindof  like Voldemort's soul when he would possess other creatures? That seems too dark magic-ey for Harry though so idk

harrypotter,3dwsub,servantoffire,6,Mon Jul 20 14:07:58 2015 UTC,I still wonder how he (Dumbledore) thought Snape was going to convince Harry to just amble up to Voldemort and let him murder him.  I can't see him just handing over his most intimate memories and letting Harry browse around them in the pensieve to prove he was really working against Voldemort and should be trusted.    Maybe he was going to let Dumbledore's portrait explain it to him.
harrypotter,3dwsub,Zwizzor,4,Mon Jul 20 18:43:15 2015 UTC,"I have no doubt that Snape planned to give the memories of Dumbledore's explanation so he knows where the truth comes from, whether he would live or not. Could Harry really be convinced any other way? That's why he was so easily able to give up those memories as he lay dying. He already prepared to. Whether he included Lily's as a way to establish why Harry should trust him when he couldn't explain it himself, or because in his dying moments that was what he was remembering, I can't be sure."
harrypotter,3dwsub,i_am__thewalrus,2,Mon Jul 20 19:39:17 2015 UTC,I'm not sure I would have believed anything Snape dumped in a pensive while he was standing there sneering at me.      Since Slughorn fiddled with his memory I imagine Snape would be even more competent at it the he was.
harrypotter,3dwsub,TheMonkeyJoe,5,Mon Jul 20 20:16:22 2015 UTC,What an awesome detail.
harrypotter,3dwsub,Entstinct,5,Mon Jul 20 15:56:35 2015 UTC,"Another great small detail she wrote in is that Slughorn recognizes Voldemort's ring when Dumbledore shows up to his place wearing it.  ""...with a heavy black stone that had cracked down the middle. Slughorn's eyes lingered for a moment on the ring too, and Harry saw a tiny frown momentarily crease his wide forehead."""

harrypotter,3dwsub,LydiaBendrick19,4,Tue Jul 21 03:31:26 2015 UTC,"Reading your post I thought about something. What if Dumbledore never trusted Snape but was thinking Voldemort might come back? What if he kept Snape around just to pass wrong informations to Voldemort, pretending to trust him?"
harrypotter,3dwsub,TinOwlJohn,4,Mon Jul 20 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"All the chills. I think you're spot on, and I can't believe I didn't make this connection the first 9x reading this smh"

harrypotter,3dwsub,SorcerersStoned,5,Mon Jul 20 19:03:26 2015 UTC,"I think you're spot on.   I'm always amazed how such small details are considered from the get-go. One that relates to this in particular, ""For a fleeting instant, Harry thought that he had seen a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes"". This was such a brief, forgettable moment during Harry's recitation of what happened in the graveyard. Yet it relates to one of the BIGGEST moments in the entire series!  I think we can all agree that JK. Rowling is fucking smart!  Edit: Grammar."
harrypotter,3dwsub,DancingNut,2,Mon Jul 20 20:13:29 2015 UTC,"Not so forgettable. I think about this line of the series all the time. Even when i'm not doing harry potter related things, it just pops into my head and i'm amazed."

harrypotter,3dwsub,DancingNut,2,Mon Jul 20 23:30:05 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying, that's the joy in re-reading, there's always something i missed last time. I meant to imply that i've been thinking about it since i read it the first time before the 5th book came out. It was always a line that i came back to, and still think about now. and i thought about it for years after first reading it, wondering if it would ever be referenced again, or if it was just a passing thing.  hope that makes more sense."

harrypotter,3dwsub,zombiemittens,3,Mon Jul 20 22:49:15 2015 UTC,This is very interesting and a nice catch! But what is Dumbledore hiding? From what you've written you seem to imply Dumbledore actually knew harry won't die.
harrypotter,3dwsub,mackenziecarp,7,Mon Jul 20 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"From the King's Cross chapter:  Dumbledore suspected (""I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good"") that Lily's protective magic for Harry was transferred to Voldemort when he took Harry's blood in book 4. So Voldemort's ""body keeps her sacrifice alive, and while that enchantment survives, so [does Harry]."""
harrypotter,3dwsub,Theroonco,7,Mon Jul 20 19:37:01 2015 UTC,"""Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not real?”   Problem is, I always considered the Dumbledore in King's Cross as Harry's projection of Dumbledore, not actually Dumbledore. He needed to make peace with Dumbledore and so needed to have this discussion. Every conclusion they came to in that chapter, I believed Harry had reached it subconsciously. Even the info Dumbledore revealed about Gindelwald and Ariana... I didn't consider them absolute truths, but Harry's version to accept everything. So for me that wasn't proof that Dumbledore actually knew, but just that Harry wanted to believe he did.  Excuse what I said, didn't want to turn this into a different discussion but typed what was on my mind. What Dumbledore said here is definitely consistent with your observation and I'm still amazed by that finding that I'm considering starting a re-read as I'm sure there are many small details like this that I've missed before."

harrypotter,3dwsub,TheProdigalPoster,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:55:58 2015 UTC,"I've always wondered if that part about Harry seeing it as if through a long tunnel meant that it was a false memory, Snape trying to get Harry to go to his death as one last bit of revenge on the Potters."
harrypotter,3dwsub,JoseElEntrenador,3,Mon Jul 20 16:14:18 2015 UTC,"I really don't understand why you are getting downvoted.  It's not exactly farfetched a thing to wonder about, considering she made a point of detailing how Harry was hearing the memory.  Though, I suspect it was less of an indicator of it being false, and moreso just Harry's reaction - kind of like how when you get bad news everything can seem to warp or 'slow down' around you while you are trying to process it.  Now whether that was due to Harry's perception, or if that is how the memory formed, who knows."
harrypotter,3dwsub,kinyutaka,-1,Mon Jul 20 21:45:13 2015 UTC,"This is a cool theory, but the only reason Harry survived was his ownership of the Elder Wand.  Dumbledore had no way of knowing Harry would come to own the Elder Wand.  He had even said he meant for Snape to get it.  I figure he closed his eyes here to keep the bigger picture hidden from Snape.  Dumbledore would have been thinking about all the horcruxes during this scene, and if Snape found out there would have been that small possibility that Voldemort would have found out somehow.  I think that's why he shut his eyes.    And Dumbledore had no way of knowing how Snape would tell Harry he had to die.  So Harry might never have seen the memories (re: your fourth point).  For all Dumbledore knew it could have been in a letter or something.  The memories were a last ditch effort because he was dying and Harry wouldn't have known otherwise."

I guess they could hurt you based on what they turn into (jk has referenced a boggart that had become a serial killer), but it's not like you dont know how to deal with it.  I also dont really think people would have that many different fears..at least maybe not as they got older. For chlidren I guess it makes sense to be afraid of random creatures and stereotypical things like mummies and spiders, but I would think as adults you'd mostly fear either yourself or someone else dying."

Unless boggarts have some kind of magic aura that makes you be scared even if you know what it is...still that wasn't mentioned inthe books."

Perhaps she knew that and was only taking some time to vent some feelings and worries it brought out, or she genuinely thought she had stumbled upon a dead family member?...I'll need to reread.

Your worst memory is not necessarily your deepest fear; for example, look at Mrs. Weasley's boggart in OotP. Her boggart turned into dead family members (ex. dead Ron, dead Percy, dead twins, etc) but since that never happened, it's not her worst memory.  Harry's boggart was a dementor simply because he was afraid of dementors. He really WAS afraid of his worst memories because his worst memories were so much worse than anybody else could imagine."

harrypotter,3dzzbf,Ramona223,7,Tue Jul 21 00:21:24 2015 UTC,I think the boggart has to look at you. Think of when Lupin redirected the attention away from Harry. It is whoever the boggart focuses on; not whoever looks at the boggart.

harrypotter,3dzzbf,Ramona223,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:45:26 2015 UTC,This is actually a really interesting question! It is mentioned in the book that no one knows what a boggart truly looks like. But maybe Mad Eye does!
harrypotter,3dzzbf,Felichor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:52:27 2015 UTC,I imagine a boggart without being seen may just default to something that many people fear. Like a large spider or a constantly morphing blob of mixed fears. Spider into a rat into a clown face into a snake into a puddle of blood.

harrypotter,3dzzbf,bfisher91,3,Tue Jul 21 01:41:19 2015 UTC,"This is quite an interesting thought actually, as Lupin's justification for not letting Harry face the boggart is that he assumes it will assume the form of Voldemort. Firstly, Harry hasn't got a clue what Voldemort looks like at this stage. Secondly, everybody else in the wizarding world has heard WAY more horror stories about Voldy than Harry.

harrypotter,3e0qd4,sociablebot,14,Tue Jul 21 07:47:50 2015 UTC,"Not only does it require a ton of concentration, like /u/douggie305 said, it also requires the desire to do it. Casting unforgivables requires a certain mental resolve, particularly an evil one. Even Harry, who is himself a powerful wizard, can only cast them at extreme times when he kind of lets his morals go for a bit (when he uses imperio in Gringotts) or when his absolute rage takes over (when he crucio's on McGonagall's behalf), but even then it's not as effective, especially in the latter case when having a just reason makes it not as strong.  Not all Death Eaters have the mental strength or lack of morals required to do so. I think that Voldemort and Bellatrix, two people who do have the mental strength and desire to see others hurt for it, don't use it more often because a) they are often fighting against people who they see as part of the superior race (they don't want magical blood spilled (this doesn't protect muggleborns because they don't see them as magical) because they want the rest of the wizarding community to join them) and b) they like to play with their food."

harrypotter,3e0qd4,Karnman,2,Tue Jul 21 02:31:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's not feasible to use the spell over and over again because it's so powerful that it takes a LOT of effort to use.   I hate to use a video game analogy, but when you're playing a game like streetfighter, there are certain moves that are freaking brutal as attacks but require you to press a very particular combination of keys in the right order. It opens you up for attack so you can't always use it right away or every time.   I imagine it's similiar for spellwork, having a spell that takes a rediculous amount of steps or a particular thought, breaks your concentration from the duel in front of you and opens you up to attack."
harrypotter,3e0qd4,mklimbach,2,Tue Jul 21 02:26:57 2015 UTC,"I think the thing that hasn't been mentioned yet is that Voldemort did not want to spill any more Wizard (pure) blood than necessary, either.  He was all about making Wizard-kind dominant and did not want to kill 75% of the bloodlines doing so.  I think that may be why most of the killings were done by him or in his presence."
harrypotter,3e0qd4,Brolympia,2,Tue Jul 21 03:24:57 2015 UTC,I've always imagined it being so draining that you couldn't do it over and over. Like the black dragon thing in Yu Yu Hakusho.

AK is much more useful for assassination of unsuspecting target, for a battle I would go for area spell like Bombarda or the Doholov curse."

I think the biggest reason they don't do it in big battles is because they don't want to risk hitting an ally with the spell. Dolohov didn't care and Voldemort clearly doesn't care so they're content to spam killing curses, but, on the whole, Death Eaters probably try to avoid friendly fire. Another possible reason is, despite it being almost completely unstoppable, if it hits, skilled witches and wizards probably require more finesse to subdue. Once they ARE subdued, however, Death Eaters probably have no problem firing off a killing curse on them."

harrypotter,3e0bzo,GoneParcel,18,Mon Jul 20 23:50:19 2015 UTC,"I think that training Harry magic beyond his age would not necessarily achieve anything; Voldemort is one of the most talented wizards known and is willing to use magic that is far beyond what Dumbledore could (or should) teach an underage wizard. Above all of this even is the fact that Voldemort is unpredictable - most of the time Dumbledore can only speculate what he is planning. It was wise to allow Harry 6 years of believing that's whilst he is the most important tool in the war against Voldemort he is not the only one fighting.    As for the animagus idea Voldemort had Petigrew as a loyal follower who was well aware that James Potter was an animagus and probably would know that his patrons is a stag. Harry would have to be an unregistered animagus (as otherwise Voldemort would find out with the infiltration of the Ministry) and IMO this still  wouldn't stop Voldemort finding him. In PS Harry didn't know Voldemort was on the back of his teachers head so wouldn't feel the need to transform, and this is the same for COS, GoF etc- most of the time Voldemort is only revealed at the last minute. In the later books Harry would not transform either IMO - when he's being moved the Order would not leave him unprotected and therefore the Deatheaters would soon cotton on that the Order seem to hang around with a stag a lot! And other times he would not transform in times of danger because that's not who he is - he would not leave his friends unaided nor would he run away from battle."
harrypotter,3e0bzo,FKSTN93,-6,Tue Jul 21 00:43:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, listen. I'm not saying that Harry should've been completely informed the second he entered the castle. I'm just saying they should've trained him just a little bit beyond his level. This could be explained to him as ""You're a target, and if he comes back or any of his followers try to complete the mission, you should be ready.""  Granted, Voldemort was believed dead, but I think Harry of all people would agree that extra training would make sense. In fact, he doesn't even need to be told anything about horcruxes for a long time. I'm just saying he should have been a bit more prepared.   As for the animagus thing. First off, I know that he probably couldn't be a stag. And that if he were a registered animagus, that would've been found out after Voldy invaded the ministry.  The thing is, that's not what I meant with my idea. I meant that Harry could be an animagus, not necessarily a stag. That was just an example. He could be anything - A mouse, a dog, a cat. Anything. And as far as the registered bit goes, I know that his disguise would be useless in DH. I'm just saying that it would be handy in his first few years at Hogwarts. And even though it didn't happen, let's say some Death Eaters go and attack Hogsmeade in Harry's third year, looking to kill Harry - to finish the job. Then, he just turns into whatever animal he is, and runs off into the forest.   I'm not saying he runs off and leave Ron and Hermione behind, either. In fact, the Hogsmeade idea is a shitty example.  Think of it like this. He's in Privet Drive, lying down in the garden like at the beginning of OotP. Then everything happens and the dementors come. It's just him and Dudley. Instead of it being a big ass ordeal where he needs to get away from the kiss and get his wand and cast his Patronus, Harry could just transform into an animal, slip away (we learned in PoA that the dementors can't recognize animaguses) and get into a better position to save his cousin. Or in a worse scenario, he sees Death Eaters coming while he's in Privet Drive, he just slips out a backdoor or a window, turns into a cat or something, and just walks away.  Obviously, in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, he couldn't slip away, and if he could, he would still fight with Ron and Hermione and the others."
harrypotter,3e0bzo,DoctorTaeNy,4,Tue Jul 21 01:33:48 2015 UTC,"I don't know about this. It is given that he would be a target simply from his incredible feat at the age of one. Extra training depends on what you define as training; Dumbledore allowing him to push the boundaries during his 1st few years could be counted as training. After all, what's the use of powerful spells if the caster is mentally unable to face the challenges?   The idea of horcruxes was only confirmed by Dumbledore after the events of GoF as mentioned by Dumbledore which he took bits and pieces of information over the years to formulate, so there is no way for anyone else to know about it."
harrypotter,3e0bzo,davect01,4,Tue Jul 21 07:31:50 2015 UTC,"This was Dumbledore's plan, shield Harry for as long as possible.  It turned out ok in the end, but caused some stress.  Who knows how it would have turned out by letting young Harry in on so much at a young age."
harrypotter,3e0bzo,davect01,-4,Tue Jul 21 00:09:29 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying that when he gets sorted, you sit him down and explain what a horcrux is and that he might have to die. I'm just saying that they should just lightly start training him at first sort of as a precaution. If he had more than a 4th year's magical education (His patronus being an exception) in the graveyard in 1995, he could've had a bigger chance of survival. I mean, he survived just fine, but there would've been less room for uncertainty."
harrypotter,3e0bzo,emash1994,3,Tue Jul 21 01:19:43 2015 UTC,"Part of the story is seeing that as powerful Dumbledore is, he still had to make judgment calls, and sometimes they were not the best."
harrypotter,3e0bzo,chaosattractor,3,Tue Jul 21 02:10:43 2015 UTC,Harry was 11/12 and not really a person that loves to learn.

harrypotter,3e0bzo,jeffala,3,Tue Jul 21 14:21:11 2015 UTC,"I think Dumbledore explains this best when he admits he loved Harry and wanted him as much as possible to have a normal childhood. All things considered. He didn't know when or where Voldemort would crop up or that his diary found its way into the school or that Harry's entry into the tournament was just to kidnap him. I'm sure in his way he believed he could protect Harry if necessary.   Besides Voldermort is frighteningly powerful, resourceful, learned in magic and has decades of experience under his belt. Unlike so many fan fictions out there about super duper Harry - I don't think it just works. Harry needed time to grow as person and magician and it was something no amount of extra training or learning could substitute.  Take boat scene for example - Dumbledore said Harry's magic wouldn't even register for the boat.  And of course Harry is more a person of action rather than study. He doesn't want to sit with his nose stuck in a book."
harrypotter,3e0bzo,Hpfm2,3,Tue Jul 21 10:51:42 2015 UTC,"Think, if Voldemort ever came onto the school grounds, he wouldn't have been able to find Harry, since poof he's a stag now.

Now, it could've been a coincidence, and could've just worked out as far as being a reporter goes, but I kind of doubt it.

harrypotter,3e0hnl,Obversa,3,Tue Jul 21 02:16:37 2015 UTC,"From info released about wand woods and cores on Pottermore:  Cedar  “Whenever I meet one who carries a cedar wand, I find strength of character and unusual loyalty. My father, Gervaise Ollivander, used always to say, ‘you will never fool the cedar carrier,’ and I agree: the cedar wand finds its perfect home where there is perspicacity and perception. I would go further than my father, however, in saying that I have never yet met the owner of a cedar wand whom I would care to cross, especially if harm is done to those of whom they are fond. The witch or wizard who is well-matched with cedar carries the potential to be a frightening adversary, which often comes as a shock to those who have thoughtlessly challenged them.     Phoenix  ""This is the rarest core type. Phoenix feathers are capable of the greatest range of magic, though they may take longer than either unicorn or dragon cores to reveal this. They show the most initiative, sometimes acting of their own accord, a quality that many witches and wizards dislike.  Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners, for the creature from which they are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world. These wands are the hardest to tame and to personalise, and their allegiance is usually hard won."""
harrypotter,3e0hnl,trekkie_becky,3,Tue Jul 21 00:54:49 2015 UTC,"I like the sound of both of them, sounds like I'm a pretty lucky Wizard"
harrypotter,3e0hnl,Obversa,5,Tue Jul 21 00:58:46 2015 UTC,"Elaborating on what /u/trekkie_becky posted from Pottermore:  With a wand made of cedar and with a phoenix feather core, you have a match as unusual as it is exceptional. Among the wand cores, phoenix is among the rarer ones, but can be among the most powerful if its allegiance is won by a worthy witch or wizard. In the Americas, particularly among the Cherokee, cedar trees are regarded as carrying the souls of the ancestors. Tradition holds that the wood of the cedar tree holds powerful protective spirits for the Cherokee. Many carry a small piece of cedar wood in their medicine bags worn around the neck. It is also placed above the entrances to the house to protect against the entry of evil spirits, and a traditional drum would be made from cedar wood.  Likewise, the cedar wand is held in high regards among the Cherokee, and among witches and wizards in general. As Gervaise Ollivander noted, those chosen by cedar wands are of an unusual inner strength, or a ""rock"" for others. They also possess uncommon loyalty and powers of perception, and tend to have a natural sense of intuition. Often times, a cedar wand wielder will almost never be wrong about a ""gut feeling"", and can easily detect those who are dishonest, liars, or otherwise putting on a 'false face'. Beware, however, as the cedar wand owner tends to have a particular sense of fierceness, protectiveness, and vindictiveness towards those who harm their friends and loved ones.   To those familiar with the Cherokee legend, it is also said that the ""spirits of one's ancestors"" reside in the wand, lending their protection and magic to the chosen. In the Americas, it is usually thought of as unwise to challenge cedar wand wielders due to this. In other parts of the world, however, the belief is not as widely or well-known, resulting in others tending to underestimate the cedar wand owner.   As the phoenix is not native to the Americas, and not often seen there, the combination of the phoenix feather core with cedar wood is definitely a rare one. While in the Americas, cedar wands often come highly prized with cores of the phoenix's electric relative, the thunderbird, the phoenix adds an entire feel altogether to the magic of the cedar wand. While cedar-and-thunderbird-core wand pairs are usually focused towards glory and duelling, the cedar-and-phoenix-core pair is far more subtle.   Like slowly kindling a growing flame, the phoenix-and-cedar-combination takes longer than its cousin to reveal its true range of magic. It also takes some coaxing, time, practice, and effort to get the wand used to performing more powerful spells, and sometimes will dispel magic on its own. Those with this wand-and-core pairing must treat his or her wand as if it is a living, breathing creature, with care, patience, and respect. Coupled with the wand wood, your wand will not take lightly to attempts to abuse its power or the wood itself, and may even 'rebel' by shooting off powerful magic as a result.  Likewise, no witch or wizard has yet succeeded in 'tricking' a cedar-and-phoenix wand into obeying purely out of abrasive force of will, or heavy-handedness. The wand will always be able to sense its chosen's true intentions, and stubbornly act out in response.   While this wand combination may try your patience at times, by staying steady and strong, and taking good care of your wand, with time and mastery of magic, your wand will flourish from a small spark into a roaring blaze of magic, just waiting to be tapped into.  [edit] I would also add, due to the nature of the cedar wood to ""ward off evil spirits"", this wand is generally regarded by the Cherokee and American witches and wizards to protect not only from evil spectres, but from Dementors, Lethifolds, and all other manner of Dark creatures as well. Ollivander himself also has yet to find a cedar wand choose a witch or wizard who later turned to the Dark Arts, and it is generally thought that the cedar wand is wholly incompatible with such spells. As such, this wand may be found among those later Sorted into Hufflepuff at Hogwarts, as Hufflepuff is the house that has produced the fewest Dark witches and wizards out of all four Houses."

harrypotter,3e0hnl,Obversa,2,Tue Jul 21 13:53:34 2015 UTC,"Thank you!    Did you do the reasearch yourself?   The Cherokee bit came from a website of Cherokee fairy tales, but otherwise I wrote it myself, based on previous studies. I studied and read a lot of mythology and mythical beast lore growing up, namely cryptozoology. Cryptozoology is a pseudo-science that includes creatures that would be regarded as ""fantastic beasts"" in the magical world, the thunderbird and phoenix included.   In case of the latter, do you have a bit more of the mediterranean viewpoint of the mythology?   If you mean that Western European and Greek mythology is generally more focused upon in mythology books in bookstores than ones with Native American ones, then yes. It is difficult to find a mythology book for children that contains Native American tales in my area.   That line about the ""rare combinbation"" because the ""Phoenix is not native to the Americas""   Oh, I meant that the combination of cedar-and-phoenix-feather is only rare in the Americas. In the Americas, they would be more likely to have a different core, as phoenixes are typically found to have originated in the Middle East in mythology. i.e. Egypt, Phoenicia, etc. China and Japan even have their own variations of the phoenix. For example, at the Japanese magic school of Mahoutokoro, they would be more likely to have a cherry-and-phoenix-feather wand combination."

Wands of English oak demand partners of strength, courage and fidelity. Less well-known is the propensity for owners of English oak wands to have powerful intuition, and, often, an affinity with the magic of the natural world, with the creatures and plants that are necessary to wizardkind for both magic and pleasure.  The oak tree is called King of the Forest from the winter solstice up until the summer solstice, and its wood should only be collected during that time (holly becomes King as the days begin to shorten again, and so holly should only be gathered as the year wanes. This divide is believed to be the origin of the old superstition, “when his wand’s oak and hers is holly, then to marry would be folly,” a superstition that I have found baseless). It is said that Merlin’s wand was of English oak (though his grave has never been found, so this cannot be proven).

harrypotter,3e0hnl,MyZania,2,Tue Jul 21 15:40:25 2015 UTC,"My wand description is my tag: 10&3/4 inches, hornbeam and unicorn hair, surprisingly swishy.  The same wand-wood as Krum and Ollivander, the same core as Ron.  They both fit, too, which is nice. I like my wand.  From the wikia:   Hornbeam selects for its life mate the talented witch or wizard with a single, pure passion, which some might call obsession - more kindly - vision, which will almost always be realised. Hornbeam wands adapt more quickly than almost any other to their owner’s style of magic, and will become so personalised, so quickly, that other people will find them extremely difficult to use even for the most simple of spells. Hornbeam wands likewise absorb their owner’s code of honour, whatever that might be, and will refuse to perform acts - whether for good or ill - that do not tally with their master’s principles. A particularly fine-tuned and sentient wand.    Unicorn hair produce the most consistent magic, least subject to fluctuations and blockages, most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts and the most faithful of wands. However, they do not make the most powerful of wands and are prone to melancholy if mishandled."
harrypotter,3e152u,thorlil,7,Tue Jul 21 03:52:31 2015 UTC,"I always thought of soul as ""indivisible"" and ""unmeasurable"" - in normal circumstance anyway. Every time he split a soul it just ... fragmented. All sizes equal, but one cannot measure the size or weight or length of it. Soul fragment just is ... that's how I always interpreted it."
harrypotter,3e152u,albeva,2,Tue Jul 21 07:57:43 2015 UTC,"Huh, that's an interesting one."
harrypotter,3e152u,MyZania,6,Tue Jul 21 10:20:10 2015 UTC,"I always assumed it got exponentially smaller.  You become effectively immortal, because your current body only contains 1/128th of your soul after the 7th Horcrux is created. Which is a very insubstantial amount."
harrypotter,3e152u,Hendo8888,4,Tue Jul 21 04:03:56 2015 UTC,"I have thought of this before, and I don't buy the option that the soul pieces would be each half the size of the previous. I like to think they either ""split themselves evenly"" as Voldemort creates them, or (my preferred theory) Voldemort chooses how much of his soul goes into each horcrux creation.  We know he planned from the beginning to split into 7 pieces due to the magical power of the number (we know he also failed because he accidentally split into 8), so maybe he put a seventh of his soul into the diary, a seventh on the locket and so on."
harrypotter,3e152u,leoxyz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:32:52 2015 UTC,"He couldn't do that, he'd need some soul left to live I imagine, or at least some left for the accidental eighth horcrux."
harrypotter,3e152u,Feldew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:44:58 2015 UTC,"Maybe he first decides to leave a seventh, then a sixth of what's left, then a fifth :P  Then Harry accidentaly took half of what was left by accident, and Nagini/Voldemort ended up with less than a seventh of the original soul.  Anyway we're just speculating here, and I also think /u/albeva and /u/bob_condor could be right. But we'll only know if/when JKR reveal the details."
harrypotter,3e152u,leoxyz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:18:20 2015 UTC,Interesting theory. I didn't think about Voldemort deciding himself how much soul he was leaving in a horcrux.
harrypotter,3e152u,bob_condor,2,Tue Jul 21 15:35:21 2015 UTC,"Potentially neither. A soul is not a physical object so it's rules of splitting might not be the same as it would be for, say, a piece of paper. The split might not be a percentage like many theorise. Not everything in the magical world confines to the laws of the muggle world and things like souls are not likely analogous to objects in the physical world."
harrypotter,3e152u,AlfonLawliet,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:37:35 2015 UTC,"Very interesting indeed,the ring made Dumbledore's hand rot and eventually he was going to die because of it,also the locket instead of rotting Ron Harry and Hermione when the put it on they just started feeling angry,i don't recall anything regarding the Diadem or the cup since they were destroyed pretty quikly. I really like thi theory!"
harrypotter,3e152u,albeva,2,Tue Jul 21 04:05:31 2015 UTC,the ring was cursed. Had nothing to do with it containing fragment of a soul.

harrypotter,3e152u,bob_condor,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:01:39 2015 UTC,Is there any evidence that the soul splits into halves? It was never more than briefly touched on in the books from memory.
harrypotter,3e152u,JessySaysRelax,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:38:43 2015 UTC,"You are right. I think I am just recalling speculation. It has never been fully addressed. According to the HP Wiki, JK Rowling is the only one who knows fully how the horcrux process happens and she hasn't revealed it. The books always just refer to ""splits"" and ""fragments."""
harrypotter,3e152u,Feldew,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:13:19 2015 UTC,"You lose half your soul. Then you have half a soul. If you split that remaining half, you have a quarter of a soul, and it would just get worse and worse as time goes by."
harrypotter,3e0nkt,mackenziecarp,17,Tue Jul 21 01:25:00 2015 UTC,"I am always astonished how many people misinterpret this, because Harry misinterprets this in exactly the same way and Dumbledore corrects him. so lets allow Dumbledore to explain  “He made seven Horcruxes?” said Harry, horror-struck, while several of the portraits on the walls made similar noises of shock and outrage. “But they could be anywhere in the world — hidden — buried or invisible —” “I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem,” said Dumbledore calmly “But firstly, no, Harry, not seven Horcruxes: six. The seventh part of his soul, however maimed, resides inside his regenerated body. That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile; without that, he has no self at all. That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack — the piece that lives in his body.”"
harrypotter,3e0nkt,Booster6,3,Tue Jul 21 01:46:18 2015 UTC,ohh ok that makes more sense thanks for the clarification
harrypotter,3e0nkt,Hpfm2,3,Tue Jul 21 02:09:00 2015 UTC,"SO he unkowingly has his soul divided into 8 parts, not seven.  I guess that's why he lost, then. 8 is not nearly as magic as seven."
harrypotter,3e0nkt,sociablebot,3,Tue Jul 21 11:03:11 2015 UTC,"He did make seven though! Harry was number 6, but he makes Nagini into a horcrux sometime during the events of the fourth book (I think it's using the death of the groundskeeper at the beginning), which makes 7."
harrypotter,3e0nkt,danceydancetime,4,Tue Jul 21 02:42:23 2015 UTC,"Yes, but his goal was for his soul to be in 7 pieces by making 6 horcruxes. He had no idea that Harry had a piece of his soul."
harrypotter,3e0nkt,sociablebot,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:30:15 2015 UTC,"I know! I forgot a part of the text in the question, I was just clarifying that seven had actually been made, despite the intention of only making six.  /u/Cuddle_phish"
harrypotter,3e0nkt,Cuddle_phish,2,Tue Jul 21 03:38:44 2015 UTC,"Yes. But he didn't mean to. It wasn't his plan. Dumbledore knew about the seventh Horcrux, but Harry wasn't to know until the others had been taken care of, and neither were we as readers. Even Voldemort didn't know Harry was a Horcrux."
harrypotter,3e0nkt,Hpfm2,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:15:32 2015 UTC,I got excited when I saw this title. I thought it would be about the fanfic that EVERYONE should read.

harrypotter,3e0564,fxofarubberduck,4,Mon Jul 20 22:56:13 2015 UTC,"I've read some fanfictions that speak of it as if it's used to perform the death penalty, which I found pretty interesting. It could just be some mythical thing, the closest the world has ever gotten to the afterlife. An archway that just separates the living and the dead.   Jo has said that the arch has been there as long as the Ministry itself, and that whether someone hears voices coming from it depends on how much belief or doubt they have about ""what lies beyond"".  Edit: Found a quote from Jo: ""It’s the divide between life and death. I tried to do a nod to that in The Tale of Three Brothers – she was separate from them as though through a veil. You can’t go back if you pass through that veil, you cannot come back. Or you can’t come back in any form that will make either person happy anyway."""
harrypotter,3e0564,danceydancetime,0,Tue Jul 21 03:37:15 2015 UTC,I found the veil to be very confusing and unfittingly ambiguous. They should have made Sirius' death more clear. I didn't understand what was going on when I was reading it at first.
harrypotter,3e0564,sinclair_heather,-1,Tue Jul 21 15:59:12 2015 UTC,Hmm I wonder if any other living person has gone through the veil. Sirius was surely alive when he passed through it because he was hit with stupefy in the book or abracadabra (or so it sounds haha) in the movie.

Everyone I've asked agrees. I love Helena Bonham Carter, but she really did not speak clearly enough at all in that scene. Especially not clearly enough to perform a spell.

I had a friend with one who printed all my parts for me, so I didn't have to pay for that.

harrypotter,3dut45,NoCommentsYaDingus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:20:52 2015 UTC,How is that not just enough? Because it's a good number.
harrypotter,3dzvtl,Alias416,12,Mon Jul 20 21:45:54 2015 UTC,"I feel the series has a believability that others do not have (as stupid as that sounds). The characters IMO show emotions and actions that are not necessarily heroic or ""magic"" but human; I felt like I could have been alongside the trio in their journey rather than an outsider reading about about characters with qualities that I could never possess.   This factor  IMO is what makes the series so special and changed the lives of so many - for many including myself it was the first time I had experienced a character battling the same raw and powerful emotions that I was feeling. The whole series is essentially about the power of love and friendship yet still depicts loneliness, betrayal and loss- feelings which as a teenager I could not explore elsewhere.   JK provided myself with a world which I could fall in love with and characters to which I aspire to be like - it really is the only fantasy that I have been so thoroughly engrossed in."
harrypotter,3dzvtl,FKSTN93,10,Mon Jul 20 23:02:58 2015 UTC,"Scale, depth, story, characters. The sheer amount of detail in all the characters and places. I love it. Not to mention it's one of the coolest things ever, magic. If it were real, imagine the possibilities. Never having to get up to get the remote again... As long as you had your wand to hand."
harrypotter,3dzvtl,NymphadorasNymphos,10,Mon Jul 20 21:51:56 2015 UTC,It's very very charming. And it doesn't overstay its welcome.
harrypotter,3dzvtl,Joseph-Joestar,6,Mon Jul 20 22:36:14 2015 UTC,"Besides nostalgia? Ha.  Seriously though - the thing I love about the series is how many little details she included regarding the plot and the world.  It adds a certain depth to her books that would otherwise of been lacking, and yet she does it while keeping her writing style simplistic - a feat that I seriously commend her for."
harrypotter,3dzvtl,BadLuckNovelist,5,Mon Jul 20 21:51:01 2015 UTC,Gah the details! Things in book 1 that come up in book 7 etc. Rowling did an excellent job in that and is just amazing no matter how many times I re read the books
harrypotter,3dzvtl,dm1436,5,Mon Jul 20 22:16:09 2015 UTC,"It has a lot of details, yes, but not the kind of details that end up with me putting the book down and not wanting to read anymore. It also started off pretty action-packed. I didn't have to wait the typical 150 pages for something relevant and interesting to happen. I really really hate that about so many epic fantasy series."
harrypotter,3dzvtl,forfearthatuwillwake,2,Mon Jul 20 22:56:39 2015 UTC,"I think that's key.  While I love the LOTR books, for instance, they contain so much detail that sometimes I have to reread passages to make sure I'm not missing something (and I have fairly good reading comprehension and such).  The Harry Potter books somehow get in tons of detail in a VERY friendly and easy to read format.  JKR is also talented at weaving humor in among all the action and details... I appreciate the fact that I can still laugh out loud (literally lol) when I'm reading them."
harrypotter,3dzvtl,EleanneG,5,Tue Jul 21 02:10:48 2015 UTC,"I think it's engrossing in a way that no other book is. It makes you want to stay in Harry's world - thinking about what your house would be, what your patronus would be, what your favorite class would be, what your life would be like at Hogwarts."
harrypotter,3dzvtl,akameiro,4,Tue Jul 21 01:29:15 2015 UTC,"Realistic character growth. Most fantasy starts out with a ""weak"" person, and then there is a tipping point where they become badass, and then they kill the evil lord of darkness.  Because Harry Potter goes trough several ordeals, and it is not just a single fight, and he goes trough puberty, it allows him a steady growth trough the series. There is also a realistic day to day, instead of a single great adventure."
harrypotter,3dzvtl,BeedleTB,4,Tue Jul 21 00:16:29 2015 UTC,"The world feels complete.  Few things go unexplained and we get to see the characters in all facets of life - home, school, out in the wizarding world, their interactions with the gov't, etc.  Theres a lot going on.  I don't think its the best series I've read (Its got nothing on Dune) but it has so much going for it.  One thing that I like is that Harry doen't act like a god.  He even admits that most of his success is due to luck and JKR makes his success very organic.  One thing that does bother me is some of the special things Harry is given that make no sense.  Somehow he has an invisibility cloak that carries him through all seven books, and somehow ""love"" protects him while it doesn't do anything for the other characters.  There are plenty of people who have the same love and who are willing to sacrifice themselves for their loved ones yet they just get blasted.  But overall the characters are great.  Snape is one of my favorite characters bc he is so complicated. Also James potter is great bc he isn't a saint, rather a bit of a trouble maker that Harry looks up to yet has to reconcile his problems."

harrypotter,3dzvtl,blinddivine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:50:01 2015 UTC,For me it is the sense that I grew up with the characters. You could understand their motivations and problems. I haven't really found another series that does this.
harrypotter,3e24g9,lionstealth,3,Tue Jul 21 11:01:58 2015 UTC,"Neville could not have been the chosen one. As much as I love MatPat, he got this one wrong.  The only reason Lily's death granted protection over Harry is because she was given a choice, Voldemort gave her the opportunity to walk away. This is why James' death doesn't create a protection, or why protection like this is not incredibly common. If Voldemort had killed James, gone upstairs, blasted Lily immediately, he could have killed Harry with no trouble. And as we learn in The Prince's tale, the only reason she was given that choice was because of Snape's request. I do not see any set of circumstances where Frank or Alice Longbotton would have been given any similar choice. Voldemort would have killed them without a second thought, and moved onto Neville"
harrypotter,3e24g9,Booster6,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:38:52 2015 UTC,"As in a one for one switch? Neville's parents die and Voldemort gets banished while Neville survives then James and Lily are tortured into insanity. Not a chance.  A) Neville's grandmother and other overbearing relatives were 100% the reason Neville was introverted and unsure of himself. So he would still turn out the same way, probably even worse since now he also has the Boy-Who-Lived expectations thrown on top of that.  B) The Longbottoms weren't under the Fidelius Charm (as far as we know) like the Potter's were. If Voldemort was defeated Peter would freak out and either disappear or throw himself 100% behind Dumbledore and the Potter's because he's a power junkie and relies on those who have it. Therefore, Bellatrix and her gang wouldn't be able to find James and Lily to torture before the Ministry and others captured them.  c) Even if Lily and James are tortured into insanity, Sirius would most likely not be in jail. Even if he went after Peter during the Lestranges trial it would come to light that Peter led them to the Potter's not Sirius. So Sirius would raise Harry and there would be no chance he'd go to the Dursley's.  I'm at work so I can't watch this video and I don't know who the game theorists are but this theory would require a lot of things going wrong and little decisions made by certain characters and even then it comes down to Harry and Neville's personalities. I don't see those taking a complete 180 just because some circumstances in their childhood changed."

harrypotter,3dzfun,Obversa,4,Mon Jul 20 21:20:59 2015 UTC,"I haven't purchased from any of these suppliers, but they all look like quality products. Keep in mind that a more intricate, delicate design will be easier to break. If you want to use it for cosplay, the cheaper, plainer wands are your best bet, but if you just want to display it you can go all out.  I've had a bit of fun making my own. I wish I had all the equipment these guys do, it would save me a lot of nicks and bruises from my pocket knife."
harrypotter,3dzfun,aurthurallan,4,Mon Jul 20 20:10:03 2015 UTC,"That's a good point that I hadn't thought of. There are a bunch of HP-style wands on Etsy in the $15-$30 range that would serve cosplay needs, I guess, but it's just not as cool as pulling out something that's been lovingly designed and intricately crafted as some of the more expensive ones. Hmm... something for me to think about."
harrypotter,3dzfun,aurthurallan,4,Mon Jul 20 20:16:35 2015 UTC,"I mean, I definitely recommend going with hardwood. You can still have a decent amount of elegance without being overly fragile, as long as you're careful with it. I've made about 15 or so and probably spent around $40 in the process for wood stain, a hand saw, etc. The wood itself is quite inexpensive. For example: http://i.imgur.com/vrfHFXz.jpg  The one in the middle is the first one I ever made, for a Snape cosplay, and it's still my favorite. The other two were ones I made as wedding presents for some friends and they are about the fanciest I ever tried to get with the faces.

harrypotter,3dz4gb,MissPippi,8,Mon Jul 20 21:41:29 2015 UTC,Yes it's very much worth it. I'm totally addicted and listen to them every day.

harrypotter,3dz4gb,meckfadiish,5,Mon Jul 20 19:02:38 2015 UTC,I found the opposite. I think fry is extremely dull. Jim has some of the best character voices (and a few terrible ones) but personally he does a better job.
harrypotter,3dz4gb,arcticblue12,2,Mon Jul 20 23:16:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. In my experience it is close to a 50/50 split between people who like Jim Dale over Steven Fry and vice versa. Eh, to each their own."
harrypotter,3dz4gb,hauntedlunch,3,Tue Jul 21 05:05:32 2015 UTC,Maybe try renting them from your local library. That's what I always do when I go on road trips. You probably could also rip them to iTunes to put on an iPod that way as well.

harrypotter,3e08g5,chimpwizard,2,Mon Jul 20 23:21:55 2015 UTC,"First of all, it suggests that Dumbledore trusts fake moody unequivocally. He doesn't suspect a thing.   Not sure about this. In the very next chapter Dumbledore clearly has Barty Crouch Jr. on his mind, because he has that memory in the pensive.   I believe at this point he already has a very short list of suspects who might causing these events to happen, and Moody must be on that list.  I think what J.K. Rowling is trying to tell us here is keep friends close, and your enemies closer."
harrypotter,3e08g5,bootkiller,2,Mon Jul 20 23:51:01 2015 UTC,"Ron's almost immediate impulse is to try and blame Krum for what happened. Krum has forever earned his ire.   Yup.   the twins tease Ron about becoming a prefect. Ron hates the idea here but when it happens, he seems cool with it.   Probably because by that time, he wanted to Hermione to think more of him. He was quite hurt when she thought it was Harry and then acted surprised.   Do you think the twins teasing of Ron hurt his self confidence? They make quite a few cracks at him even in this short conversation.   Of course it does. It would hurt mine too. He's easily their biggest target, Bill and Charlie are older and get more of their respect, Percy is older as well so has an easier time blowing them off. Ginny is the baby and she's the only girl, so she doesn't seem as fair game. I don't think there's a single scene where they make fun of Ginny, even in PS they're promising her ""loads of owls"" and cheering her up. Ron's their prime target.    fake moody says that Hermione could be a good auror. And even though she doesn't get into that line of work, I think she could've been good at it. Better than Harry and Ron at least.   I actually disagree. Hermione's smart and competent, and could be decent at most things. But I don't think she's cut out for auror work. She's better at the planning than the actual in-the-moment stuff. I also think that while she's willing to take risks for the sake of the cause/the boys, she doesn't get as much actual enjoyment out of them as Ron/Harry do. Not that Harry/Ron are just in it for the adventure, but I think the part of Hermione that actually enjoys riding hippogriffs and dragons is a lot smaller. We obviously see that she's an excellent balance for Harry/Ron, so if it were a team of three, then yes. But I don't think Hermione herself is particularly cut out for detective work.   They're studying planetary divination here. Isn't that basically the same thing as astronomy? And didn't they study that the previous year?   Planentary divination is more like astrology. Definitely not the same thing. Studying the stars and the planetary motions is a science, deriving meaning from them is a completely different matter. Obviously this is the wizarding world, where prophecies and such have a little more legitimacy. But they're still two completely different focuses.   I don't study the same things every year, why is it odd that they would introduce a new type of divination. She seems to move through different forms of divination, they do tea leaves, crystal balls, and palmistry. They can't fit them all in 3rd year, nor should they have to.   It never made sense to me that wormtail would stick with Voldemort here. He could've hidden for years without the protection of Voldemort. Surely it's better to take that risk than go back to this.   He's paranoid. Voldemort does have one loyal follower (Crouch) and a few others that would come to his aid if he had to ask.   the security for Dumbledore's office is pretty bad if someone who has only been there once can guess the password.   Shouting random types of candy at the statue seems something that no one but a desperate student would think to do. I can't picture someone like Fudge or a Death Eater sinking to that level. And in several of the books, the fat lady seems to have some level of control over who she lets in, she's not charmed to automatically open at the sound of the password. I'm guessing Dumbledore's gargoyles are the same way since they shut Umbridge out even after she was technically headmistress. The gargoyles can assess a situation and use their judgement. But this is Harry Potter, who's already a favorite of Dumbledore's and who looks pretty desperate.   I just noticed a typo in my book. At one point it says Crouch when clearly it was meant to say Fudge.   Which line?"
harrypotter,3e08g5,OwlPostAgain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:03:26 2015 UTC,"who do you think inherited the estate of Barty Crouch Snr?     Unless he had some distant relative that the reader never learns about, I assume that his property would escheat back to the state, i.e. the Ministry would take possession of his property. After all, his only heir (his son) was given a lifetime sentence in Azkaban for using the Cruciatus Curse on the Longbottoms, and I assume a lifetime sentence in Azkaban precludes a person from any inheritance.     the security for Dumbledore's office is pretty bad if someone who has only been there once can guess the password.     I don't think that Dumbledore's office is meant to be super high security; after all, Hogwarts has so many protective spells around it, that if someone is already inside the castle, it's only by Dumbledore's leave.  Which means that the only real function the gargoyle serves is to prevent people already inside Hogwarts from stumbling onto Dumbledore's office accidentally.  Basically it's there so Dumbledore doesn't get constantly pestered by students."
harrypotter,3dyiza,fluffybunnyboo,31,Mon Jul 20 16:02:18 2015 UTC,"I'll go first to get the conversation going: I was 100% convinced that the true death eater spy was McGonagall.  Now bare with me, we all love her, but for the last 3 books I was dead sure that she had to be. Every little passage she was in I was scouring for clues and perhaps came up with the most complete case of confirmation bias there has ever been.  In order for this to make any sense, though, you need to buy into the thought process that Minerva is what can only be described as the spy close to Dumbledore. Snape's the guy that grabs the limelight but we know he didn't attempt to ally with Dumbledore until the very end, which means for years, maybe decades before, our favourite Transfiguration teacher was essentially the perfect spy, playing the long game, keeping as close as possible to the only Wizard capable of overturning Voldemort's plan for a world in which Wizards don't need to hide themselves. With that established:  Why was she at Privet Drive? She's supposedly unsure whether Voldemort's really dead but she knows exactly where Harry Potter is going to end up? It seems a bit fishy. She's constantly disgruntled and bothered throughout the scene, which completely fits with her character , but could also be explained by the fact that she's just lost her master, and the boy she was about to kill in revenge doesn't turn up, instead the most powerful Wizard currently alive does instead. Of course this is hidden well, but again, she's a fantastic actress.  Again, in Philosopher's stone- why on Earth is Professor McGonagall's Chess set unharmed, despite all the other obstacle's being obviously fought past? The key has a bent wing in madam Hooch's room, if I remember correctly- the Ogre was knocked out, etc. Why is that? Is it possible that Mcgonagall left a failsafe for Quirrell to get past?  It jumps a bit forward now but these are important.  In the Goblet of Fire, McGonagall was the only one in the room when Barty Crouch Junior was administered the Dementor's kiss, which seems completely shocking considering she's obviously a stupendously powerful witch. Is she incapable of a simple Patronous?  Something else about the Goblet of Fire was that when Harry was in the graveyard Voldemort referred to his “most faithful servant” being at hogwarts. Most people seemed to think it was referring to Crouch, but others thought it was referring to Snape. But what about McGonagall? Isn't she the one that cleans up the mess? By covering his tracks and allowing Barty to be kissed by a Dementor? Incidentally the Goblet of Fire was the book which made me question this theory, because why the hell didn't Voldemort just get McGonagall to take Harry to him at any point? I couldn't work it out and always assumed there would be a reason that JK would give us at the end.  Other bits and bobs are stuff such as McGonagall referring to Voldemort as “the Dark Lord” at some points, and the idea that McGonagall is roughly the same age as Voldemort. Maybe they went to school together? Again, I read that online, though.  Admittedly as a 14 year old Harry potter nerd I was probably reading a little too much into things, and you could probably make a similar case for many characters in Harry Potter, but from a purely plot perspective she was definitely the perfect person to be a spy if there was one."
harrypotter,3dyiza,onekrazykat,14,Mon Jul 20 16:07:16 2015 UTC,I don't like you very much.     This is an amazing breakdown of how it could have been possible McGonagall (my favorite character) could have been a Death Eater spy.
harrypotter,3dyiza,tintin_92,12,Mon Jul 20 17:26:34 2015 UTC,"Wow, that was a really good one. If Harry Potter had been written for more mature audiences, this would've been a good plot point. Of course, Harry Potter is allegorical, so the only known Death Eater from Gryffindor also has to be a coward. The death eater spy had to be a double agent because of the power of love. I like Harry Potter, but I wish at times that it didn't have to be so... ""perfect""."
harrypotter,3dyiza,Obversa,10,Mon Jul 20 17:52:02 2015 UTC,"Other bits and bobs are stuff such as McGonagall referring to Voldemort as “the Dark Lord” at some points, and the idea that McGonagall is roughly the same age as Voldemort. Maybe they went to school together? Again, I read that online, though.   Rowling ultimately retconned McGonagall's age, I think, to put an age gap between her and Voldemort. Before the retcon, McGonagall was only a year older than Tom Riddle, meaning that they were roughly the same age [like Harry and Ginny]. McGonagall also wasn't half bad looking, nor was Dame Maggie Smith."
harrypotter,3dyiza,b__w,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:06 2015 UTC,I still can't see how it would be possible and she would have prob been last on my list of suspects.   I thought it would have been Bagman in GoF. Hes a new character introduced and acts suspiciously throughout.
harrypotter,3dyiza,litladyloveshp,20,Tue Jul 21 03:46:48 2015 UTC,"I totally thought one of Susan Bones's parents was RAB.   I watched the first movie before I read the books, and I remember thinking that Susan Bones was going to be important because they showed her being sorted into Hufflepuff. It was also mentioned in the books that Susan's family had been killed by Voldemort's followers and I remember connecting that to RAB. Voldemort knew that the Bones family had the locket, which is why he personally killed Amelia Bones, Susan's aunt, hoping to get the locket back and once again turn it into a horcrux. I figured her mom or dad stole the locket and that Harry, Ron and Hermione were going to have to go back to Hogwarts to ask her about her parents involvement, then have her reveal that the locket was in her possession at Hogwarts.  My crazy theory got spoiled before the 7th book even came out since JKR released the identity of RAB early."
harrypotter,3dyiza,litladyloveshp,12,Mon Jul 20 17:37:28 2015 UTC,"This is actually fantastic.  I remember talking to people about RAB and refusing to believe it was Regulus (mainly because my Dad who also read the books came up with the theory before I did, and I wanted to be the guy with all the right theories) and I couldn't think of anyone else it could be. If somebody had mentioned Susan Bones to me I'd have jumped on that theory like a it was the only life raft in the middle of the ocean"
harrypotter,3dyiza,Alyys,3,Mon Jul 20 17:43:28 2015 UTC,"I know, I had such a thorough theory and I was like ""oh, sad days""  I also hate when a mystery gets figured out long before the rest of get a chance. It feels too easy or I guess I feel stupid for not figuring it out/getting a chance to figure it out. So when the fan theories started pouring in about Regulus as RAB I was adamantly against it."
harrypotter,3dyiza,icomeprebroken,30,Mon Jul 20 18:00:45 2015 UTC,"I was convinced that Sirius wasn't actually dead and would somehow come back.  Sure, he went through the veil, but I thought there would be some magicky way that part of him would survive.  I even considered that his portrait would magically show up at Grimmauld Place and Harry could converse with him that way.  I'm still sad that I was wrong. :("

harrypotter,3dyiza,b__w,5,Mon Jul 20 17:53:48 2015 UTC,Yup. I had to re-read it about 3 times to really grasp what had happened. But then I was sure he would come back.

harrypotter,3dyiza,Alyys,15,Mon Jul 20 20:07:40 2015 UTC,"I thought Bill Weasley would be the DADA teacher in book five, and that he'd also turn out to be a death eater spy.  Given the format of the four previous books- it's always the DADA teacher- I thought JKR would really need to up the stakes to have us fall for the same trick again.  And Bill Weasley was tailor-made for the role.  He'd be hired because of his curse-breaking abilities, as they translate perfectly to teaching DADA, and he could also try to break the curse on the position while he was there.  No one would suspect a Weasley, and he'd be friends with the trio already.  His betrayal would deeply hurt them and drive home the real darkness of war and all that.  Hed go dark for pretty much the same reasons as Percy split from the family: bitterness from being so poor when he was young, thinking his family members were fools for sticking with the losing side when they were purebloods and could easily be accepted by Voldemort."
harrypotter,3dyiza,strider_moon,8,Mon Jul 20 20:21:27 2015 UTC,this would have been great! That storyline would have knocked me for six.  My favourite part is that the actor who plays Bill Weasley in the movies is also the son of the actor who plays Mad Eye.  having him inherit the role of DADA teacher would be a pretty snazzy TIL that would pop up every couple of months in reddit.

harrypotter,3dyiza,TheBardsBabe,14,Tue Jul 21 05:09:20 2015 UTC,"OK, so after Half Blood Prince came out and we learned about Horcruxes, there were theories flying around everywhere. One of the most accepted was that it would be revealed in Book 7 that Harry was a Horcrux, and I always thought this theory would turn out to be completely wrong. Obviously, we know how that turned out, but I guess that's one of my biggest ones that was way off."
harrypotter,3dyiza,secret759,8,Mon Jul 20 16:17:50 2015 UTC,"I'm with you. I thought the idea that the magic could rebound and somehow turn Harry into a Horcrux was ridiculous (and I still kinda do grumblegrumble), and I was rather upset when I was wrong.  Not upset enough to not enjoy it, but just enough to be annoyed."
harrypotter,3dyiza,TheBardsBabe,6,Mon Jul 20 17:19:24 2015 UTC,"My theory was that Harry's scar was the Horcrux and that he was only magical because of Voldemort's magic inside of him, so I thought the sacrifice he'd make in the last book would be giving up his magic (and his whole new world and relationships he'd discovered, a place where he was finally loved and special and important...of course Hermione and Ron would still love him but they would have a very different relationship if Harry were a squib) in order to defeat Voldemort."

harrypotter,3dyiza,TilKen31,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:36:22 2015 UTC,"Well in this one fanfic he does just that. He said Avada Kedavra but he thought Levi/Liberacorpus. It was incredibly timed, so that his nonverbal spell hit Dumbledore before the green light of AK.  (Dumbledore still died though)"

harrypotter,3dyiza,4thefat,3,Mon Jul 20 18:10:48 2015 UTC,"I kinda wondered this myself. My problem with his death was that I always imagined the killing curse to just make a person not be alive anymore. No trace, no lifting them up, and throwing them backwards."
harrypotter,3dyiza,litladyloveshp,2,Mon Jul 20 23:52:45 2015 UTC,"Yes! Whether this was a theory or simply a coping mechanism, I firmly believed Dumbledore wasn't dead."

harrypotter,3dyiza,Heir2theThrone,4,Mon Jul 20 20:22:11 2015 UTC,Me too. I actually thought it up until he died. McGonagall just didn't seem like she lost of romantic love when she found out he was dead.

harrypotter,3dyiza,TilKen31,5,Mon Jul 20 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"I used to think so too. Probably because I would make it my life goal to do so if I was a wizard.

harrypotter,3dyiza,PreSchoolGGW,6,Tue Jul 21 02:46:28 2015 UTC,Back before Order of the Phoenix came out I always thought up of crack pot theories as to why Voldie ever chose the Potters to kill. I believed there was going to be time traveling storylines resembling that of the Terminator franchise. How Harry would go back in time before voldemort rose to power to kill him off. This in turn would cause Voldemort to search out the potters to stop this future from ever happening. I was mental.
harrypotter,3dyiza,Karnman,6,Mon Jul 20 18:04:31 2015 UTC,"I used to think Snape wasn't bad and that he was going to turn out to be good, then he killed Dumbledore and I remember telling my mom how I was all wrong...If only I held onto my beliefs till the 7th book..."
harrypotter,3dyiza,Gadzookie2,6,Mon Jul 20 18:07:41 2015 UTC,"after OotP I was convinced that somehow Neville was going to be the ""chosen one"" all along because Voldemort had marked him as an equal in some unknown way.

harrypotter,3e18p1,supershawninspace,9,Tue Jul 21 04:27:04 2015 UTC,"Hufflepuffs are hard working and compassionate. They are loyal to their friends and are accepting and welcoming to all sorts of people. (Or they aspire to be, in my case.)  There are people who say that Hufflepuff is the ""catch-all"" house. The house for people that are not smart enough for Ravenclaw, not ambitious enough for Slytherin and not brave enough for Gryffindor. However, I always felt the students were sorted based on the trait they admired most. As such, it's entirely possible for a Hufflepuff to be brave, smart and ambitious, they just appreciate kindness the most.  tl;dr It means that you are a fantastic person to know.

However, the reason Harry cannot see them that time is because it takes awhile to process someone's death. Harry, and everyone else were most likely still in shock.   After having the summer for the memories to sink in, Harry was able to grasp the reality of the situation, and that's why he was then the next year."
harrypotter,3e2zcw,deathbatcrash,5,Tue Jul 21 15:54:48 2015 UTC,"There's even a line right after Cedric's death that specifies that Harry couldn't take it all in:   And then, before Harry’s mind had accepted what he was seeing, before he could feel anything but numb disbelief, he felt himself being pulled to his feet."

harrypotter,3e2zcw,4everpurple,7,Tue Jul 21 16:11:27 2015 UTC,That is well known. the explanation is that the death did not have time to sink in yet so he could still not see them.
harrypotter,3e2zcw,GravityTortoise,4,Tue Jul 21 15:59:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this has been mentioned a lot, its actually in the FAQ, but basically Rowling knew the Thestral thing would be a bit of a problem, but didn't want to introduce them at the end of GoF because there was so much else going on. She decided that a death needed to sink in, that the person had to come to terms with an accept the death before they could see the Thestrals."
harrypotter,3e2zcw,Booster6,2,Tue Jul 21 16:16:00 2015 UTC,"Yes, this has been argued extensively. Something about the death not having set in yet with Harry or something. I believe it was an actual mistake, but Rowling or fans came up with a reason to justify it."

harrypotter,3e052o,chickenmann72,9,Mon Jul 20 22:55:32 2015 UTC,"I think if you're giving an overall Hogwarts teaching award, it would go to Lupin. Regardless of how well he knows his subject, he is good at being a teacher. He's patient, even-tempered, encouraging, knows just how far to push a student, fair, and honest. He endears his students to him pretty quickly, and Dean Thomas calls him the best DADA teacher they've ever had.   Examples include how he defended Neville against Snape's (rather malicious) bullying, the way he successfully used the ""I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed"" line on Harry, the even-tempered way that he handled various problems, etc.   Snape was no doubt an excellent teacher,    I would dispute this. He did seem to know his subject, but he was quite clearly not cut out for teaching.   There's a difference between Harry learning and Snape teaching. In fact, in HBP, Harry says that the prince was a far better teacher than Snape was. This is rather ironic in hindsight, but if Harry can learn better out of a book that Snape annotated then Snape himself, there's something wrong with Snape's teaching methods. Snape was essentially such a poor teacher to Harry that Harry found it easier to read the textbook.   When it comes to the expelliarmus, Snape didn't teach Harry anything. Harry just used a spell he saw Snape use."
harrypotter,3e052o,OwlPostAgain,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:25 2015 UTC,"Admittedly, Harry was probably a little reluctant to try and learn anything from Snape because he was Snape, so it was easier for him when he was out of the room (like during the OWLS, Slughorn or the HBP's book). I am sure many of us have had teachers/classes where we couldn't bothered to even try and learn properly because the teacher was a, excuse my language, dick. I would say that Snape was a good enough teacher because he generally got most of his students through with passing grades - even though he was impatient, cruel and showed favouritism. Not excellent, like McGonnagal and Flitwick, but good enough for the most part."
harrypotter,3e052o,strider_moon,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:22:08 2015 UTC,"It is ironic that the mutual enmity between the two of them prevented Harry from benefitting more from Snape. But how extraordinary is it that Harry is able to reproduce a spell after only seeing it once? I don't think there was ever a spell Harry learned on the first try, yet he does it not once, but multiple times with Snape's teaching. Add to that the fact that Levicorpus works so well nonverbally at the merest suggestion from HBP at a time when Harry is struggling with any kind of nonverbal spells, and it's hard to dispute that on some level, Snape's and Harrys minds worked in a way that ""clicked"" so to speak"
harrypotter,3e052o,mrSnorkack,10,Tue Jul 21 01:54:48 2015 UTC,"Snape was excellent at potions himself but a terrible teacher. He relentlessly bullied students he didn't like and intimidated them so much they couldn't concentrate on their work. At the start of a class he would usually just put the instructions on the board and tell them to get on with it without explaining anything, he never even shared the many simple alterations he made to some potions that allowed harry to go from an average student to the best in the year with minimal effort."
harrypotter,3e052o,HalfBloodPonce,4,Mon Jul 20 23:44:23 2015 UTC,"At the start of a class he would usually just put the instructions on the board and tell them to get on with it without explaining anything   That's exactly how most of the teachers teach. They tell you a spell and what it does, and then ask you to demonstrate it. Slughorn did practically the same thing, only he told them to read from the textbook and completely ignored students who weren't a part of his club. Also, Snape stated that his class has a higher pass rate than average for OWL (""whether you are intending to attempt N.E.W.T. or not, I advise all of you to concentrate your efforts upon maintaining the high-pass level I have come to expect from my O.W.L. students""), and Umbridge admitted that his class was advanced for their grade level. Despite being harsh and often unfair, he was an effective teacher.    never even shared the many simple alterations he made to some potions   We don't know that. He wrote his instructions on the board instead of making them use the textbook, they could have very well incorporated his alterations. Also, the alterations that he made were in the NEWT textbook, which they would not have used in years 1-5. Or it's possible that only at NEWT level are potions complicated enough that you can get creative with them, as is the case IRL once you get to more advanced levels of science."
harrypotter,3e052o,lokidemon731,2,Tue Jul 21 01:35:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think you can say he was an effective teacher by comparing him to other incompetent teachers and saying ""eh, well, could be worse"". He created a hostile environment for the students, didn't give extra help to those who were struggling, and played favorites which ensured that his favorites did better than those he disliked (self fulfilling prophecies are something educators need to be very mindful of). I think he probably did give the students his potions tweaks, but that again only makes him good at potions and not a good potions instructor. What he should have been doing was explaining why the book was wrong and how to make corrections like that.  He may have had a high pass rate, but we shouldn't judge teachers on the kids who pass, we should judge them on how they work with the kids who are failing. Especially when they have such small classes at hogwarts, there was plenty of time for individualized instruction.  Snape was a genius and a great character but he was a depressingly bad teacher."
harrypotter,3e052o,icomeprebroken,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"I never said Snape was a nice teacher- only that he was Harrys greatest teacher.   As far as him bullying his students, while I don't agree with his methods, they were undoubtedly effective.  Even Neville was able to pass OWL level potions. Indeed, the only people mentioned who didn't pass were people he didn't bully- Crabbe and Goyle.   And as far as not teaching his additions to potions, he was being paid to teach the school-approved cirriculum, not his experimental solutions. He had neither the time nor the desire to write a new textbook for the class."
harrypotter,3e052o,lokidemon731,4,Tue Jul 21 00:20:59 2015 UTC,"I guess it depends how you define a good teacher.  To most people, a good teacher is one who doesn't antagonize their students and will actually teach that extra information if they think it'll be helpful."
harrypotter,3e052o,SorcerersStoned,2,Tue Jul 21 00:22:49 2015 UTC,"while I don't agree with his methods, they were undoubtedly effective.   I very much doubt it was effective considering the fact -- and I know this is a work of fiction, but still -- there are numerous studies that show negative reinforcement and punishment are ineffective teaching methods. And we do see evidence of that in the books, Neville did not do well in the classroom because of Snape. He passed his OWLs because he wasn't bad at potions in the first place, he just had a bad teacher. This is evidenced by the fact that Neville does well when Hermione whispers instructions to him -- you know, teaches him -- but can't make potions when he's under constant stress and not given proper instruction."
harrypotter,3e052o,GravityTortoise,4,Tue Jul 21 16:27:10 2015 UTC,"While Snape has his moments. I would vote for Lupin. He was just a cool guy, and he reminds me of a teacher I had in HS."
harrypotter,3e052o,onekrazykat,4,Tue Jul 21 02:28:36 2015 UTC,Except for the he was really a Death Eater part Barty Crouch Jr was an effective teacher.
harrypotter,3e052o,onekrazykat,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:28:38 2015 UTC,"Heh, Harry just has a knack of learning from his enemies :D"
harrypotter,3e052o,Pigwarts,3,Tue Jul 21 03:34:03 2015 UTC,I'm actually going with Hagrid. He loved selflessly and unconditionally. He was proof to not judge a book by it's cover (or a person by his race.) That confidence can be the difference between a Hippogriff or a Flobberworm. He was possibly the most loyal character in the series. He taught the importance of friendship. He in short taught Harry the most important lessons in life by simply being himself.
harrypotter,3e052o,OwlPostAgain,3,Tue Jul 21 04:05:32 2015 UTC,"I agree that Hagrid was Harrys greatest father figure, but when it came to teaching, he wasn't exactly the safest around, was he?"
harrypotter,3e052o,Pigwarts,2,Tue Jul 21 04:11:14 2015 UTC,Why is it that we only think that about Hagrid? How many times were there injuries in Potions class? How many charms misfired? How many transfiguration injuries were there? How many students are injured during Herbology? I'd argue that injuries occur in ALL the classes. .
harrypotter,3e052o,DoctorTaeNy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:59:55 2015 UTC,"That's a fair point, but the other teachers weren't introducing NEWT level creatures to their first year students, were they? Or having them care for anything as horrible and dangerous as the screwts?  Hagrid's problem, really his only problem, was that he vastly underestimated the danger of the animals he cared for, and therefore taught about."
harrypotter,3e052o,DoctorTaeNy,2,Tue Jul 21 06:17:42 2015 UTC,Most of the examples you gave of Snape being a good teacher was actually just Harry being a good learner. If Harry would have had an even better potions teacher then he could have been great at it.
harrypotter,3e052o,Ryder10,2,Tue Jul 21 00:07:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's about Harry being an especially good learner though (that's more of a  Hermione thing). Look at how long it takes Harry to learn Accio, or how long it takes before he can finally produce a corporeal patronus. Harry may be a dedicated learner, but he's by no means a fast learner.  Until we come to Snape. Spells Harry learns from HBP he learns with ease- even nonverbal ones, which he always has problems with. And he is immediately able to cast an excellent Expelliarmus spell just from one demonstration, but only because Snape was teaching."
harrypotter,3e052o,Curae,4,Tue Jul 21 00:43:30 2015 UTC,"Snape wasn't teaching, he just happens to use that spell in front of him."
harrypotter,3e052o,mackenziecarp,2,Tue Jul 21 01:34:13 2015 UTC,I wasn't trying to say that Harry is a good learner (which is exactly what I said). What I meant was that if Harry had a different teacher he would have learned just as much (and most likely more). It didn't have anything to do with Snape.
harrypotter,3e052o,HalfBloodPonce,2,Tue Jul 21 01:58:27 2015 UTC,"I agree that Harry did picked the spells in HBP and Expelliarmus spell pretty fast as compared to the rest of the spells he was able to do, but could it be because these few spells are actually pretty rudimentary?   In OoTP, Lupin did mentioned that that particular spell was popular during their time, can we assume that everyone could do it?   And won't disarming your opponents the most basic stratergy to defending yourself? They did mentioned this as much as during the first meeting of DA, although no one learnt it as quickly as Harry."
harrypotter,3e052o,lokidemon731,2,Tue Jul 21 07:52:12 2015 UTC,"In Ootp Harry teaches the disarming spell to the DA. From second years to seventh years, he sees issues that need to be corrected. In addition, Harrys first use of the spell is against a fully qualified (if crappy) adult teacher. Harry picked up sectumsempra and successfully cast it (albeit with devastating effects) on his first try. Same goes for levicorpus, muffliato and all the other spells Harry picked up from type HBP. And all this is in addition to the tips and tricks in potions learned from the HBP."
harrypotter,3dzde8,sydni_x,3,Mon Jul 20 19:35:20 2015 UTC,"Most definitely. The first 30 seconds of Arrival is similar to the first 45 seconds of Hedwig's Theme, both in instrumentation and feel; the violins build up in an almost identical way, but different enough you say ""that's exactly the same"". There is a few bars of Hedwig's Theme at about the 1:00 mark in Arrival, it's a slightly different key though. At about the 1:45 mark in Arrival, we hear the beginning of Hedwig's Theme, and it's fairly prevalent from then on, in different ways. Sort of like variations on a theme.  It wouldn't surprise me if these are the two pieces that were the foundations of the series, and the first ones that Mr. Williams was happy with. It's also possible that they were the very last pieces done for similar reasoning. Being the closing credits, and the opening scene, it wraps the movie up nicely, they're the bookends, what everybody is going to remember. Of course I'm just a musician and not a composer, and I don't know Mr. Williams theory on writing, so that's purely speculation.  Additionally, it should be noted that Hedwig's Theme is considered the main theme for the series by many. When you ask somebody what the main theme music for Harry Potter is, most are going to say Hedwig's Theme, or if they don't know the name (which is probably likely in most cases) sing a few bars from it. So it would make sense that it's the oft repeated piece throughout the entire series, rarely outright, mostly as a few bars here and there, sometimes in the forefront as the melody, sometimes in the back as the counter-melody."
harrypotter,3dxg7s,ImHully,8,Mon Jul 20 09:48:40 2015 UTC,"I've read the entire series through maybe 5 times. I never go more than about a year without picking them up again, been that way for years!"
harrypotter,3dxg7s,SighNaps_,9,Mon Jul 20 09:56:41 2015 UTC,"23 times. As a child I had many books because whenever I asked for a new book my parents bought me one (books were the only thing my parents would never say 'No' to, so I was basically able to read new things constantly), but Harry Potter was always my favourite series.  I grew up reading Harry Potter. I'm fairly certain that several aspects of my personality and general character come from reading Harry Potter so much, that's how much the books affected me. I never really read any other children's books (I always read adult books because they were longer and more interesting things happened in them) apart from His Dark Materials and Narnia, but HP was always just the best. So I've read all the books 23 times each because I've read so much fanfic in the last decade or so that it's nice to get a 'reset' every once in a while."

harrypotter,3dxg7s,haloraptor,4,Tue Jul 21 09:53:43 2015 UTC,"I read the series exactly 1 time and that meant a lot of breaks, because I read every book when it was published and that's it. I have to read tons and tons for my studies, so there isn't much time for reading books for nothing but pleasure unfortunately. I wouldn't mind a re-read, but it's seven books and I have a list of at least 300+ books left to read. I have listened to the audiobooks a lot of times though as I can get other stuff done meanwhile.

However, I had read the first three books multiple times, then re-read them all right before the 4th book came out, and so on (as one does), and would reread the incomplete series just because while I waited to whatever new book to come out. so while I've read the first books in the series at least 8-9 times, the entire series, not so much. Doesn't help that if you grew up with Harry you aged faster, so I was in college by the time the 7th book had come out and leisure reading time got more and more scarce as time went on. Still get embarrassed when I mess up minor details with other fans due to not having read the books in so long. Such a massive part of my childhood/life though."

I went through a period of depression and my parents would take away my electronics a lot which made me feel isolated and contributed to the negative feels, so I would open up the fifth book to where Harry yells at his friends and it helped a lot for some reason.  I know a lot of people hate that scene. But it's just... so human. Harry's not perfect.

I'm inclined to think voldermort bought the house after he did what he did,because it will be a brilliant prize. It'll be a constant reminder (of his what we think was his 1st murder).

harrypotter,3dyxx4,Obversa,2,Mon Jul 20 23:14:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think Voldemort would have bought the house. He didn't have any money as an orphan, and he didn't make much as a sales clerk for Borgin & Burke's, either.  My theory is that the Malfoy family bought and owns the house."
harrypotter,3dyxx4,Obversa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:51:50 2015 UTC,I think that was just given as a reason as to why there was no one living in the house at the moment.

harrypotter,3dyl8z,BadLuckNovelist,2,Mon Jul 20 16:27:04 2015 UTC,There is so much in the Wizarding World that leads to pain an death.  ;-)   Raising a young wizard must be doubly hard as a normal kid.  It would not be surprising to see a higher infant/child mortality rate.
harrypotter,3dyl8z,davect01,2,Mon Jul 20 17:08:57 2015 UTC,They seem to have supernaturally strong survival instincts though. Remember when Neville's uncle (?) threw him out the window to force him to show magic and he bounced?

harrypotter,3dyl8z,PotassiumArsenic,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:47 2015 UTC,"There's mention of toy brooms (Harry had one) and school brooms. I guess I've always figured that there are brooms that limit altitude, speed, and possibly even location.   That would explain why both of Harry's gift brooms are such a big deal. They are not only excellent for Quidditch, but also unrestricted (or at least the movies suggest they are by showing him flying well outside the castle grounds)."
harrypotter,3dyl8z,ColourSchemer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:35:34 2015 UTC,"Since there's no trace for enchanted magical items (since you don't have to use magic to use them), parents are expected to maintain responsibility for their children not flying off towards a city. There are lots of things that could potentially break the statute of secrecy, and most are probably coming from adult wizards playing ""pranks"" on muggles rather than from kids."
harrypotter,3e04fz,momotheflyinglemur,4,Mon Jul 20 22:50:42 2015 UTC,"A World War I or II film about wizards and witches on the front lines fighting their own secret battles against enemy nations would be awesome. A story about a kid dropping out of Hogwarts to fight for his country, maybe, and all the horrors he witnessed while fighting. You could play around with the roles magical creatures had, too. House Elves helping in the nursing tents or forced into the trenches by their masters, Goblins growing richer off of the chaos, and Centaurs growing more mistrusting of wizard-kind over the destruction of their land. The wizarding world could be startled, for the first time in centuries, about the type of destructive technology the muggles suddenly have and whether or not they should be worried.  It's a story that could be taken in quite a few directions."

harrypotter,3dzev9,kornkobz69,4,Mon Jul 20 19:46:44 2015 UTC,"So there are a few things going on here. It wasn't (strictly speaking) the protection that caused Harry to carry a piece of Voldemorts soul, when Voldemort tried to kill Harry, the protection responded by rebounding the curse. The trauma caused by the destruction of Voldemorts body ruptured his soul and caused a fragment to attach itself to Harry (I will mention at this time that while Harry was a soul container, he WAS NOT a Horcrux. I realize Dumbledore calls him one, but that was for simplicity, Rowling has said a Horcrux must be created deliberately. Since Harry was a mistake, it makes him his own unique category of object).  So what would have happened in the battle? This is speculation, but I believe the protection manifested itself differently in the battle. Instead of rebounding curses, it simply caused them to miss. In the chaos, and with the distances involved, this was possible, whereas with baby Harry, you had a wand pointed directly at a stationary infant, so rebounding the curse was the only protection that could be offered.   But what if Voldemort had grabbed someone, pointed his wand right at their head, and said ""Avada Kedavra"". Presumably, the curse would have rebounded onto Voldemort, just like it did 17 years prior. Would that person become a carrier for Voldemorts soul? I don't think so. At this stage, there are no other Horcruxes. Yes Voldemort's soul is even more tattered and unstable, but there is nothing remaining to bind his soul to the earth once his body is destroyed. So the curse would rebound, destroy Voldemort, and his soul would them immediately pass into the next life without opportunity for a fragment to attach itself to a new host.  As for a theoretical limit on the number for Horcruxes that can be made, I do not know. Voldemort already split his soul into 8 pieces, I don't think there is anyway to determine what the effect of doing it more times would be. As for was he able to do this because he could not love, the answer would be, indirectly, yes. What I mean is, it was because he could not love that he was able to so recklessly murder and cause harm to other human beings. The lack of love didn't give his soul the ability to be split so many times, but it did give him the power to commit so many horrible acts to split his soul so many times"
harrypotter,3dzev9,Booster6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:15:56 2015 UTC,"Great answer. However, Voldemort could love. Rowling said he only loved power and himself, but that is love too, don't you think? Does love have to be focused on another person outside of yourself in order to be valid?"

harrypotter,3dzev9,SorcerersStoned,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:12:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe -just my speculation- not. The thing is, when Lilys protection made his killing curse backfire to him, all his other horcruxes were intact. So although his body got destroyed, his soul stayed alive, and because it was already so unstable it parted again. Thats why Harry became something like a Horcrux.  But when the snake died, there were no more ""insurances"" for his soul left, so it would be finally destroyed and would not part again as there was nothing left where it could anchor itself to on earth."
harrypotter,3dzev9,da_aundare,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:17:08 2015 UTC,"I think the key thing about Voldemort not making more Horcruxes was because he believed that splitting your soul into 7 pieces was the strongest thing to do, because the number 7 is magical (cant quite remember where i saw/read this so please correct me)."
harrypotter,3dz0le,riddin365,17,Mon Jul 20 18:04:36 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head yourself, you haven't read the books. Movie ginny you're right is almost just a filler. There is so much more detail in the books where you get to know her more and see how much they are suited she also has her brothers twins sense of humour and is actually very funny"
harrypotter,3dz0le,badassvoodoomonkey,4,Mon Jul 20 18:15:27 2015 UTC,"I just reread (okay I listened to the UK audio books) just recently and they build her up in books 4,5 and 6 so much that it was someone who you really want to be in their circle and know more about."
harrypotter,3dz0le,jaytrade21,14,Mon Jul 20 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"In the books you'll notice that Harry cares a lot less about Hermione than Ron. Whenever Hermione isn't around, Harry doesn't care. When Ron isn't around, Harry constantly goes like 'I wish ron was here'.  Also Ginny is a funny, intelligent and great character in the books. She's more like a cardboard cutout in the movies, she's just very bland there. :(   Also some very important things about Hermione have been left out in the movies, which is a shame, because it shows how annoying she can also be. In the movies I feel that Hermione too has been made less flawed by far, which helps as well to team her up with Harry rather than Ron."
harrypotter,3dz0le,Curae,7,Mon Jul 20 18:12:50 2015 UTC,"All of Ginny's character development happens in the background of the books 2-5. You see glimpses of it but since she isn't part of the main trio it's not presented to you on a silver platter and you have to actually pay attention to get it. This isn't just for Ginny it happens to a lot of characters.  By the time we get to the sixth book Ginny is an attractive, popular, funny, athletic girl with a fiery temper who's loyal to a fault and willing to stand up for her friends. She's a star quidditch player who just won the Quidditch house cup for Gryffindor as a fill-in seeker and is now trying out for the house team as a chaser. She's also one of the few characters who has no problem putting Harry in his place when his brooding and angst gets out of hand.  Hermione on the other hand is one of Harry's best friends. However, in the books she's also the complete opposite of Harry. Harry will flaunt the rules if he thinks he can do something better, he takes action and rushes in headlong. Hermione will usually want to hold back, read a book on the subject, and get a teacher. While towards the end of the books she becomes much more willing to ignore authority and do things herself near the beginning of the series Ron and Harry usually have to goad her into everything. She's also constantly annoying Harry to do school work and talk about his feelings which Harry really doesn't want to do. The biggest problem with Hermione though is that she doesn't challenge Harry. If Harry works himself up and starts yelling Hermione rolls over and just lets him do what he wants. Ginny will slap Harry down when he starts acting like that.  Your biggest problem is that you only watched the movies. As others have stated in the movies Ginny is a cardboard cut-out character with no development and no actual use to the plot.  Hermione on the other hand is the best character ever created with no flaws who everyone needs to love. She steals character development from almost every other character especially Ron and winds up being this unattainable figure of amazingness that doesn't actually exist in this or any world. I blame most of this on the huge popularity and talent that Emma Watson gathered to herself as the movies progressed, causing the writers and directors to favor her character over others.   In the books it's very clear that Harry loves Hermione like a sister but has no physical or emotional attraction towards her. It's also very clear to Harry by the fourth book that Hermione likes Ron and Ron like Hermione. It's obvious to everyone except for them really."
harrypotter,3dz0le,Ryder10,9,Mon Jul 20 18:33:11 2015 UTC,"Book Ginny is an actual present character after book 2, unlike in the movies. It's also the way their (Harry and GInny's) relation evolves during books 2-5. You don't really see that in the movies, she kinda just disappears after the second one and shows up in the order of the phoenix with pretty much no lines.   And  I'd like to add than from reading the books you get to read what harry is thinking rather than just listen to waht he says. From his internal dialogue is quite clear that he never regards hermione as anything more than his best friend.  It always bothered me that people find theat harry belongs with Hermione, but I think you may have just decoded it for me. Most of those people may be movie-goers primary or even exclusevely, and fromt hat perspective, I supose I can see your point. From watching the movies there is no way in hell I'd pair Harry with Ginny and be happy with it.  Hell, did they ever solved the whole Cho Chang storyline in the movie? i think they just kissed and never talked to eachother again."
harrypotter,3dz0le,Hpfm2,4,Mon Jul 20 18:26:44 2015 UTC,Basically they put Cho in again as the one who tipped off Umbridge instead of her Ravenclaw friend and then I can't recall if you see her again.
harrypotter,3dz0le,jaytrade21,4,Mon Jul 20 18:39:34 2015 UTC,CHO tips off Umbridge?  HOW DOES THAT MAKE ANY SENSE?

harrypotter,3dz0le,scottydanger22,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:20:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah it was veritaserum, Snape says so when Umbridge wants to use some on Harry. He says something along the lines of ""I used the last of it on Miss Chang"""
harrypotter,3dz0le,Eaglemeele,2,Mon Jul 20 20:12:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks, I couldn't remember from the movie. In the book, it was made to look like the friend did it because of her parents, can't recall if it was Veritaserum as well (I know she tried to use the majority on Harry, but failed because Harry threw away the spiked tea)."

harrypotter,3dz0le,bikeboy7890,5,Mon Jul 20 20:35:05 2015 UTC,"her first instinct was choosing to stay with Harry because she blindly trusted harry enough to know that harry will succeed in this msision   WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA Are you sure you even watched the movies??? It was her mission too, she recognized Ron was being a dick and she still needed to do her part, as well as support her friend.  Why would she ""blindly trust"" Harry? There's nothing to even trust him on, it's not like he had some secret plan for killing the horcruxes. They were in this together and just because Ron was abandoning them didn't mean she would too."
harrypotter,3dz0le,icomeprebroken,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:34:55 2015 UTC,"Yep. i have watched all the movies in perfect order.    sorry for being so naive, you're right. it was her mission too. its good that she stayed with harry.   but when i watched that scene, i thought hermione might go with ron considering the fact that people were disappearing and it was too dangerous to roam alone at a place like that (as evidenced by the scenewhere ron was listening to the radio and there was news of people disappearing) .. i mean , didn't hermione thought for a second that Ron might die or disappear on his way back? didn't she consider even for a second that it wasnt safe for Ron to travel alone? .instead , she was like ""NOPE. Let him leave, im sure he'll be totally safe and will return sooner or later to join us again""   ron was already under the impression that harry and hermione have a thing for each other . ron was hermione's BF. if i was hermione , i wouldve tried to reason with ron and ask him to stay with harry , clear his misconceptions. ron was already doubting hermione, why would she make him doubt her further more by staying with harry instead of clarifying ron's misconception. like i said, if i was hermione, i would've made sure that ron doesn't think that im having an affair with harry. i wouldn't wanna break ron's heart like that.   Btw in the movie when ron was leaving , hermione didnt agree to leave, ron said ""i understand, i saw you two the other night"" and then all she said was ""Ron , thats nothing"" .  She didn't make any other effort to make ron stay with them in their mission . i mean, RON is her soulmate , she didn't even consider for a single second that RON might never come back/return.  whether he was being a D**k at that moment or not, RON is still the love of her life . if i was hermione, i wouldn't want love of my life(ron) leave like that without worrying about it and risk losing him.  so thats what kinda made me think that hermione maybe cares more about harry . well , im a new fan, im naive, im not an expert. its not only that scene, theres other scenes too , in the series, that'll make you think that harry and hermione are MADE for each other.   However, as people are saying, ginny wasnt properly developed as harry's love interest in the movies, so anyone who has watched only the harry potter movies might get under impression that harry and hermione pairing are better than harry and ginny. so i think thats the reason im under impression that harry and hermione are a better pair. because i havent read the books."
harrypotter,3dz0le,stefvh,4,Mon Jul 20 22:03:52 2015 UTC,Read the books. The Harry/Hermione in the movies is portrayed in a completely different way than their relationship in the books.
harrypotter,3dz0le,creyk,3,Mon Jul 20 18:29:33 2015 UTC,"Here is how the author addressed this question:   Answer from JK Rowling in 2005: [The] plan was, which I really hope I fulfilled, is that the reader, like Harry, would gradually discover Ginny as pretty much the ideal girl for Harry. She's tough, not in an unpleasant way, but she's gutsy. He needs to be with someone who can stand the demands of being with Harry Potter, because he's a scary boyfriend in a lot of ways. He's a marked man. I think she's funny, and I think that she's very warm and compassionate. These are all things that Harry requires in his ideal woman. But, I felt — and I'm talking years ago when all this was planned — initially, she's terrified by his image. I mean, he's a bit of a rock god to her when she sees him first, at 10 or 11, and he's this famous boy. So Ginny had to go through a journey as well. And rather like with Ron, I didn’t want Ginny to be the first girl that Harry ever kissed. That's something I meant to say, and it's kind of tied in. One of the ways in which I tried to show that Harry has done a lot of growing up — in “Phoenix,” remember when Cho comes into the compartment, and he thinks, ‘I wish I could have been discovered sitting with better people,’ basically? He's with Luna and Neville. So literally the identical thing happens in “Prince,” and he's with Luna and Neville again, but this time, he has grown up, and as far as he's concerned he is with two of the coolest people on the train. They may not look that cool. Harry has really grown. And I feel that Ginny and Harry, in this book, they are total equals. They are worthy of each other. They've both gone through a big emotional journey, and they've really got over a lot of delusions, to use your word, together. So, I enjoyed writing that. I really like Ginny as a character."
harrypotter,3dz0le,DoctorTaeNy,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:40 2015 UTC,"I am really sorry to say this, but knowing that people just watch the movies and not read the books makes me feel really sad about it. Some people might like the movies better, personally the lack of important details in most of them just drives me crazy."
harrypotter,3dz0le,Almavet,3,Tue Jul 21 03:05:35 2015 UTC,"It can't really be answered if you don't read the books, because the movies completely fucked up when it comes to her. This article however gives a pretty good explanation.  http://www.hp-lexicon.org/essays/essay-hh-suited.html"
harrypotter,3dz0le,stefvh,5,Mon Jul 20 19:01:00 2015 UTC,"No, her words were taken out of context. She only said that ""in some ways"" that they were a better fit (in comparison to Ron/Hermione, not Harry/Ginny - she went on to say that Harry and Ginny's love is true)."
harrypotter,3dz0le,Allwaswell7,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:25:59 2015 UTC,"I agree, the dance scene was so well done."
harrypotter,3dz0le,Awesomeguyandbob,-3,Mon Jul 20 18:28:48 2015 UTC,"Personally, I still believe that Harry/Hermione is a better choice than Harry/Ginny, and I've read the books countless times.  You might come to the same conclusion too if you read them also; it's a matter of opinion.    Many people here are saying that Ginny is an infinitely better character in the books than in the movies, and while that's true, she's still a horribly written one.  Her character is literally written to be a perfect companion to Harry.  Some may like that, but to me, it felt horribly artificial and contrived.  You see, book Ginny may have a great deal of personality, but she is written with the depth of a blank sheet of paper.  Her character arc is being in love with Harry to not being in love with with Harry, expect, nope, she still is.   Add on to the fact that the deepest connection they have in Half Blood Prince (which is supposed to be the story where they fall in love) is a physical one.  Seriously, read through that book and count the number of times that Harry remarks on anything else than how she looks or smells like (it's like only three).    In essence, I just feel that it's an extremely shallow relationship that had potential if Rowling put any effort at all into making it genuine.  So if you like Harry/Hermione, there's nothing wrong with that."
harrypotter,3dz0le,stefvh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:06 2015 UTC,"Her character is literally written to be a perfect companion to Harry.   Which would be the case if JKR had written Hermione to end up with Harry. This isn't an anti-H/G argument, this is an anti-Harry/Anyone argument.  It's only in the movies where she is basically just Harry's LI. When the Trio is going hunting Horcruxes, Ginny doesn't sit and meep over him. She along with Neville and Luna restart the DA and resist against the pureblood fascists.    Add on to the fact that the deepest connection they have in Half Blood Prince (which is supposed to be the story where they fall in love) is a physical one.    I seem to remember Harry realizing that they understood each other perfectly (obviously not physical).  Now why don't I believe you...  It's all in good faith, though. :P   Finished that book yet so that you can get around to answering me on Potterforums? :D"
harrypotter,3dz0le,Awesomeguyandbob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:24:01 2015 UTC,"Clarification:  I felt that Rowling wrote Ginny more as a person who fits every need of Harry, but not as a three-dimensional character like many of the other women in the series. I get that some people enjoy that, but to me, it felt like lazy writing.  It's a technique that I've seen in many other stories where the author is not great at writing romance.  But then again, just opinion.  And yeah, I finished.  Thanks for asking!  Totally forgot about going back to the forum though .  I'll head over tomorrow."
harrypotter,3dvh11,Hoodier,60,Sun Jul 19 21:30:56 2015 UTC,"I don't think there's anything I dislike about it except for one thing - JKR's treatment of the Slytherin house. It can't possibly be that all of the Slytherins in Harry's timeline or earlier were bad people. Yet Draco was only shown to become a slightly better person at the very end of the last book; Phineas Black was the least popular of all the headmasters of Hogwarts; Slughorn was well-known for his favoritism and, well, he was quite a coward in HBP; Snape, while greatly skilled and very heroic and brave, was still an awful bully; Salazar Slytherin himself was a pure-blood supremacist. How many of the Slytherins left the castle before the battle? All of them, save for Malfoy, Crabbe and Goyle? And I don't care that some of the people on Voldemort's side might have been their parents or relatives.    So yeah, I'd love it if there were at least one good example of a Slytherin in the books. We do have Andromeda Black (Tonks's mom), but her character, as interesting as it is, was only mentioned a few times, and that's not enough. Merlin was a Slytherin too, but was mentioned even less."
harrypotter,3dvh11,Moonstone1966,28,Sun Jul 19 21:48:48 2015 UTC,"RAB? Sure he became a Death Eater, but he was always kind to his house elf, Kreacher, and he sacrificed himself for Kreacher to obtain the locket.   But yeah, outside of Gryffindors, you don't see much glory given to other houses."
harrypotter,3dvh11,Ratchet6859,13,Sun Jul 19 22:02:14 2015 UTC,"I can't believe I've forgotten him! Yes! Regulus Black was a really nice example of a good Slytherin. I think he was a Death Eater because, firstly, he was raised by people who hated Muggles and Muggle-borns and ""blood-traitors""; secondly, he was attending Hogwarts when Voldemort was more powerful than ever before, and I bet lots of his house mates supported him, even if they weren't Death Eaters themselves. So Regulus was a product of his environment, but seeing as he was capable of kindness and sacrifice and when he truly understood what Voldemort was, he hated him and he willingly chose death so that Voldemort could be killed, he was, in the end, a good person."
harrypotter,3dvh11,Moonstone1966,11,Sun Jul 19 22:13:33 2015 UTC,"Regulus Black plastered newspaper clippings of Death Eater activities from the Daily Prophet all over his room. He did eventually come to regret his decisions and do the right thing, but I don't believe he was merely a ""product of his environment"". JKR has said that like Draco, he was drawn to the idea of being a Death Eater and willingly became one, but the reality of it was too much to handle."
harrypotter,3dvh11,HalfBloodPonce,5,Sun Jul 19 22:38:13 2015 UTC,"She also said that had Tom Riddle had a loving mother to raise him, he wouldn't have turned out the way he did. Maybe if Regulus was raised by the Weasleys, he wouldn't have become a Death Eater? He probably would've been a lot like Persy, seeing as they were both hungry for power. But I doubt he would've supported Voldemort. But he was raised by the Blacks, who weren't only hateful, but also abusive (there was post here a few days ago on Sirius's home life, you should check it out). His mother verbally abused Sirius on a regular basis and loved and praised Regulus, I don't think he ever ventured to sit down and think about his family's views in depth and realize how wrong they are. His family members weren't Death Eaters, but they thought Voldemort was right. Now, when he discovered the Horcrux, he must've finally realized what kind of person Voldemort truly is and what lengths he's willing to go to to achieve his end. If he was simply a coward, if he was just too afraid to fight on Voldemort's side any longer, he could've just gone back and told Kreacher to never speak of it again. He could've disappeared, changed his identity and traveled to another country, if he thought his life was in danger, Voldemort would've probably thought he'd been killed by Aurors, that wasn't uncommon. But he decided to give up his life so that Kreacher could survive and destroy the Horcrux. The reality of being Voldemort's ally was too much to handle for Lucius Malfoy. Not for Regulus."
harrypotter,3dvh11,Moonstone1966,3,Mon Jul 20 00:12:09 2015 UTC,"no, he couldn't have. if he tried to disappear, voldemort would have found him and killed him, as with karkaroff. if he told kreacher to never speak of it again, voldemort can still legilimise him and find out that kreacher is alive and all he told him, and kill him.   JKR: Well Sirius said he wouldn’t have been because he wasn’t important enough, remember?  MA: But that doesn’t have to be true, if [R.A.B.] is writing Voldemort a personal note.  JKR: That doesn’t necessarily show that Voldemort killed him, personally, but Sirius himself suspected that Regulus got in a little too deep. Like Draco. He was attracted to it, but the reality of what it meant was way too much to handle. JKR: That doesn’t necessarily show that Voldemort killed him, personally, but Sirius himself suspected that Regulus got in a little too deep. Like Draco.

harrypotter,3dvh11,zojgruhl,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:00 2015 UTC,"If he wanted to get out because it suddenly became too dangerous, he would've run; when you run from someone, there's still a chance that you'll survive. Plus the time on the run, when you're alive, it's still better than being dead. But Regulus chose to die right there and then, and try to bring Voldemort one step close to death.    The interview you quoted took place two years before DH. Obviously, Joanne couldn't have spilled the beans about Regulus and Kreacher and everything. Kreacher's tale in DH and the contents of the note Regulus left in the locket clearly state that Regulus saw how wrong he was and that he was anything but a coward.    Also, when Harry, Ron and Hermione search the house on Grimmauld Place, Harry sees a picture of Regulus and his Quidditch team at Hogwarts. Harry mentions that Regulus was a Seeker, like himself. Why would that piece of information matter unless Joanne wanted us to understand that Regulus wasn't really the kind of person he's been believed to be all those years."
harrypotter,3dvh11,Moonstone1966,11,Mon Jul 20 18:30:02 2015 UTC,"Not to mention the constant quips toward the house from the narrator, how they are always portrayed as haters of good/harry/hogwarts/dumbledore. I would give a lot for a more robust portrayal of slytherin house in the series. There is, of course, the argument that since the books are from Harry's perspective, that portrayals of Slytherin are going to be one-sided and immature, but it really grinds my gears and makes me way less partial to constant Gryffindor success and praise.   I am definitely not a Slytherin but it is the only thing about the series I absolutely despise and cringe at whilst re-reading the books. I love to imagine Slytherins intermingled with classmates like normal children, apart from those who are explicitly described as stemming from that crowd.  I also find the movies beyond the first two to be terrible but I still understand and appreciate them as separate visionary works from the books, and can understand why others like them."

If we're ignoring that, I would keep in mind that, in a way, we experience Slytherin through the eyes of the characters in the books. All of the adults have lived through Voldemort's reign of terror, and Slytherin is (or seems to be) the sole House for Death Eaters and Voldie support, aside from foreign wizards and other creatures. Slytherin still has that association hanging over their head during Harry's generation. Honestly, Slytherin was supposed to be the bad guys. Harry Potter is supposed to be primarily a children's/YA book, and I don't really think it was necessary for her to pander if the goal was to have an obvious ""bad"" house."

harrypotter,3dvh11,LordDVanity,23,Mon Jul 20 01:31:16 2015 UTC,"The actual worldbuilding beyond Hogwarts is shaky. Rowling once said that there were only ~3,000 wizards in Great Britain, a scale which makes sense in some places but none at all in others. The claim that there are only four wizarding schools in Europe makes no sense when you think about the scale. There's a lot of other poorly explained features, like where the Ministry or Hogwarts get its budget from, who the ""school governors"" are (who are mentioned in COS and then more or less totally forgotten), etc. Rowling's expanded universe is going to need to some retcons if it wants to make sense."
harrypotter,3dvh11,jogarz,8,Mon Jul 20 03:02:04 2015 UTC,Yeah a hundred thousand people at the world cup. Where did they all come from?
harrypotter,3dvh11,MemphisMike11,13,Mon Jul 20 03:24:04 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if we take Great Britain as an average for wizarding populations in muggle countries, this means roughly 3,000 wizards for every 64 million people, or roughly 0.000046 wizards for every muggle.   Multiply by seven billion, and you get about 328,000 wizards. That's roughly the population of all wizards on the planet, apparantly.   So this means that nearly 1/3 of the entire wizarding world attended the World Cup. And tickets are supposed to be hard to get.  It makes no sense. Personally, my headcanon has a much higher wizarding population."
harrypotter,3dvh11,jogarz,2,Mon Jul 20 03:43:34 2015 UTC,Didn't she also say that there's on average a thousand students at Hogwarts at any given time? I'm bad at math but come on Rowling you're not even trying.  Edit: see to she

For example, in the U.S., once you get an hour or so outside of the major metropolitan areas, it gets to be a lot of wide open spaces that could easily hide large wizarding communities in the HP world. Not to mention areas muggle don't want to live. (Deserts, extremely cold areas...) so I imagine the 3000 isn't a representative sample of the ratio of wizards to muggles."

harrypotter,3dvh11,danceydancetime,9,Sun Jul 19 21:49:22 2015 UTC,"After making it half way through the 4th movie, I decided it would be better not to carry on with any of the others. The books have so much depth and the movies failed to capture it. Perhaps the movies 5-8 did a better job, but I'd rather not take the time/risk to find out. I did however like the visuals and actors that were chosen for the movies.   Perhaps if there were a tv show made, a show that could take the time to capture all the little things...I remember my disappointment with the movies started with the first one, when they cut out one of my favorite moments in which Dumbledore told Harry he saw himself holding up a pair of woolen socks when he looked in the mirror.   Anyways. If I had only watched the the movies and hadn't read the books, I don't think I would have any love for HP at all. And it's unfortunate, a lot of people I know have no interest in HP or say that it's overhyped..but most of these people (especially the youngsters) have only seen the movies, which don't do the series justice"

POA was my favorite Harry Potter book and I was so annoyed that they couldn't take 5mins to explain who the Marauders were. I had to explain so many things to my parents after we would see the movies because they left so many things like this out.

However, that was hardly the first change that was made and was arguably less impactful on the rest of the story than other changes made earlier in the series of movies.   I find the movies nearly incomprehensible without an outside understanding of the books. As a result of the movies' inability to stand on their own 16 feet, I deem them a failure in storytelling. However, as other commenters have noted, the movies did a wonderful job of assigning beautiful visuals to some of wonderful things the readership had been enjoying for years.  On an unrelated note, absquatulate is a fun word and it appears not once in any if the books or movies. A travesty."

Sirius Black was sentenced to Azkaban for life WITHOUT A TRIAL. Who elects the Minister? Is s/he appointed? How does the justice system work? Is Azkaban the ONLY wizard prison?

For example, Crookshanks(yeah, he's a cat) was one of 2 who knew Peter Pettigrew was alive and evil, and was the only one aiding Sirius for a while(he helped get Harry his Firebolt too). Then, he was pretty much non-existent in the books. He wasn't at Hogwarts during GoF, where he could've IDed Barty Crouch Jr through his disguise as Mad-Eye, yet he was there in OotP, glaring at Ron and Harry as they faked predictions for Divination. I don't even think he was mentioned in the 7th book.   So many things like time turners(I read the thing where Rowling said she wanted to have them destroyed via the combat in the Department of Mysteries, but they were still there for book 4), Fluffy(never seen after book 1, pretty useful to have in battle, I mean the spiders from book 2 got involved, why not a giant 3 headed dog?), Myrtle(not mentioned in 7 either, though I doubt any ghosts could've done much in the battle), and every foreign group of wizards(primarily the Beaubatons given Maxime helping Hagrid in the diplomatic journey to the giants) have no significance in most of the later books. I know that Rowling gave some of them mini stories/explanations, but in the overall series, a bunch of them just got shunted.  EDIT: For movies, the Cinemasins videos on them sum up many of our shared grievances with them."

But I always thought that Quaffle and Snitch are bewitched at Hogwarts to go slower, because they are just unprofessional children and a game cannot last for days.  But in professional leagues and tournaments, I think the balls are faster and hard to catch. Because we know that games last for few days occasionally. As Harry saw in the World Cup Final, chasers are more important and catching the snitch doesn't always mean winning. And think about a long tournament, all goal matters at the end.

The most obvious one being Dumbledore's sexuality—retrospectively looking at the relationship, you can see how it makes sense. But knowing his feelings for Grindelwald makes the whole situation SO much more robust that it's pretty shocking it wasn't more explicitly hinted at in the book.   Also she could have done better with that cheesy epilogue to include a few more substantial details about everyone's grown up lives.   On the other hand, I can't hate on it too much.

Like how everyone always refers to Dementors exclusively as the ""Azkaban guards"" until we find out what they are and then they're always called Dementors. Same with Voldemort's followers not being called Death Eaters until GoF and then consistently using that name from then on. I get from a literary standpoint why it needed to be written like that, but it just comes off as awkward during rereads.  Also, in the first book, Hagrid's description of Quirrell doesn't really sound like he taught Muggle Studies up until that year. He talks about how Quirrell was studying from books, but took a year off to get real experience and now he's scared of students and his own subject. I guess you can look at what he says in a way that makes sense, but it doesn't sound like it was written in that mindset (and most likely wasn't). They changed a few other things in the books to keep things consistent with later developments, and I think that part would probably benefit a lot from that."
harrypotter,3dvh11,bevyofbacon,3,Mon Jul 20 07:10:15 2015 UTC,I was really shocked that DADA didn't have anyone teaching it over one year since Tom applied for the job it just seems unrealistic given there is not many wizards in UK. But idk if I remember it properly tho.
harrypotter,3dvh11,Privatdozent,3,Mon Jul 20 12:37:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, so this might be a bit weird, but I always loved the parts of the book when they went to the school on the train. In the first book  the journey there was written down so nicely and it was one of my favorite chapters, and it was recreated beautifully in the movies too. Then in the later books, it is hardly mentioned or horrible things happen while on the train (Harry being attacked by Draco, attacked by a Dementor). I just really liked the cheerful mood of going into Hogwarts as it seems like it would be something so exciting if it was happening to you....but then the book turned it to something different later on"

harrypotter,3dvh11,csmalley3777,3,Mon Jul 20 14:36:19 2015 UTC,"Voldemort is way too clear cut of a villain. I like morally ambigus situations which are closer to no existant than poor in the harry potter series. I just feel like villains are more ""realistic"" (ironic I'll grant you) than just oh look it's wizard hitler"
harrypotter,3dvh11,Ryder10,2,Mon Jul 20 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"I feel that the more we found out about Voldemort, the less clear-cut he became.  He grew up in an Orphanage in what I think was 1920s Britain - not a time period that was very nice to children, especially lower class orphans. He hates his life, and feels like he deserves more, daydreaming that he is somehow special, a lot like Harry does before he finds out the truth.  He learns that his mother died giving birth to him, and decides she must have been a muggle, because anyone with magical powers must be able to prevent death. This is where his obsession with immortality started.  He's a vindictive little sod, but ravenous for knowledge about magic. He finds out that his mother was a witch, who succumbed to the pathetic ailment known as Death. His Muggle father, he learns, abandoned him and his mother (to be fair, he was drugged and raped, so I can't blame him too much), which starts his hatred of Muggles.  So we have a bright kid who has learned a lot about really old magic, who grew up in a loveless, harsh environment (with Muggles), who hates and despises anything non-magical, and has a pathological fear of death. He also knows he's directly descended from one of the most legendary and powerful Wizards ever, who also happened to be a blood-purity fanatic.  He descended into the Dark Arts to chase immortality. He wanted to rid the world of Muggles, and the Dark Arts gave him extra tools to do this. He was a frightened, jealous sociopath with the tools and ability to pretty much rearrange the world as he saw fit."

harrypotter,3dvh11,MemphisMike11,2,Mon Jul 20 15:16:31 2015 UTC,"I think JKR has gone on record saying that Voldemort was capable of feeling love, but never experienced it, so was unable to find it for himself.  He wasn't born evil - he became it through circumstance and choice."

I understand that Rowling herself has admitted some fault there, but in my head time turners are not an issue. If you notice in PoA, Harry+Hermione don't actually change anything about the past.

I strongly feel Harry should have remained single and let the readers fill in the blanks. Epiloge. It came out of the blue, somehow so ... forced down our throats... Numerous Factual inconsistencies. e.g. did Voldermort disappear for 10 or 25 years after the school? Harry resorting to unforgivable curses - twice! Dumb luck with the Eldar Wand - I have no issue with the elder wand plot device, but the way Harry gets it is just so ... dumb. I wish he would've known he had to defeat Malfoy and then gone and done it on purpose - would have been so much more powerful! Binding Magical Contract - in GoF. Frankly this was unbelievable. Harry didn't sign it, didn't submit it, it should not have affected him at all. If that's the case anyone can put anyone into any kind of binding contract ..."
harrypotter,3dvh11,Uneje,6,Mon Jul 20 11:49:35 2015 UTC,"I think the Ginny issue is partly due to the books mostly following Harry's POV. He doesn't really interact with Ginny for ages, then suddenly she's back, and awesome and hot and cool. People can be like that, but the lack of shown development hurt her character.  The Epilogue also fell a bit flat for me. I know JKR wanted to set the canon for the future of the characters, but it felt rushed. Honestly, I'd have preferred a 'Message from the Author' style thing where she just said what happened.  I don't mind Harry resorting to Unforgivable Curses. Moral ambiguity is something Rowling went for quite a bit, and showing that even the heroes have to do bad things was quite realistic, I feel.  Dumb luck, small actions and ripple effects - these are Tolkien-esque ideas that I really like. Sauron was defeated because Bilbo spared Gollum. A small, physical scrap between two seventeen year olds ultimately decides the fate of the whole Wizarding world. Stuff like this happens all the time in real life - it's a bit too pat, but it mimics reality.  I don't think we know enough about the contract, but Dumbledore does state before the Goblet is lit that entering your name means accepting your place in the competition should you be chosen, so to not enter if you're not 100% sure. Hermione's jinxed paper in OotP shows that people can unknowingly sign contracts, however I think the Goblet is a rare, specific case."

And considering that Parvati and Lavender were mentioned to be good friends who both really admired Trelawney and loved divination class (in the books), I think those things make a strong case for the body lying between them being Lavender's.  But really, though, the book leaves it somewhat open-ended. After the movie, I was left with the thought that she had died, but I guess it's not definite."

It's frequently been wrong about quite a few things."
harrypotter,3dwnhr,Lord_Cronos,2,Mon Jul 20 05:23:06 2015 UTC,"At some point I found a discussion page regarding this, and the Wiki admin's explanation was that they treat the books as ""first-tier"" canon, and the movies as ""second-tier"" canon... so basically, anything in the movies that doesn't specifically contradict something from the books is treated as canon. Not saying I agree with that practice, necessarily, but that was why they decided to include Lavender's death in the wiki entry."
harrypotter,3dwnhr,goodbyereckless,2,Mon Jul 20 19:50:04 2015 UTC,"That certainly explains a lot. I feel like it would be an OK practice if they just implemented a tagging system to identify which things are movie canon and which are book, or write the articles in a way that identifies both canons separately.

harrypotter,3dwnhr,shaun056,7,Mon Jul 20 09:19:46 2015 UTC,"Well, you asked the million dollar question so here we go:  Rowling never said anything on Pottermore. Look... Rowling always says 'there's me with the books and there's them with the movies.' Books supersede all in canon but what the wikia does is merge the two in some crazy messed up conclusion.   Look at the differences:   Book: Lavender falls of balcony. Greyback attacks. Hermione fights back. Trelawney fights back. Lavender stirs feebly.  Movie: Greyback attacks someone, Hermione fights, Lavender dead. Dead. She went through more crap in the books and lived. The movie has a simple attack and she dies.  So, we see that the cause of death is conflicting between both. How the wiki concluded that this means death is beyond me, especially as it would delete the meaning behind Lavender being saved by Hermione.  The wiki says she died of her injuries, but that is only because the book has her feebly stirring and the movie shows her dead. Personally, I believe the movies is just that, movies. Adaptation does not equal canon and it never will. The books says she stirred, she moved, she was alive. If Rowling meant to kill her, she wouldn't have even implied a sliver of hope that she might pull through and never follow up with it. Therefore, it is to be assumed that she lived.   Not to mention, if she did die, she would've almost certainly been mentioned among the dead after Harry beat Voldemort. 'Fred, Lupin, Tonk, Colin Creevey and fifty others.' One can argue that she was simply one of those fifty, but I can't imagine why Rowling would see fit to confirm Colin's death (someone much less significant than Lavender) and leave hers I the air and expect us to believe she dies.   The wiki is just a site forever at work. They take the tiniest, stupidest sources and cite them as canon. They take books, movies, third-party books, games, Lego games, newspaper articles, images from the making of the movies, anything they can get their hands on and use them cite a source as canon.   Under the wikis' canon hierarchy , books supersede. The only reason Lavender is counted as dead is because they cite a third party book and use it to back up the movies and merge that with the events in the book.   This crime isn't only with Lavender. They cite Armando Dippet as being still alive by Harry's second year, they cite Wiards can live to be 300-some because of some image from the making of the movies, and when Rowling says Slytherin students came back and fought Voldemort, they blatantly deny this and insist the Slytherins fought with Voldemort because Voldemort said so.   The wiki, I'm beginning to think, has their own version of events and it's a shame they're commercializing it for fans to widely believe even though it's not true. Take what they say with the smallest grain of salt you can find (and break that grain to emphasize how small it is.) I believe they simply do this because tbh, Lavender is not liked at all. Fans hate her, the wiki is run by fans, therefore, it stands to reason if there's anyway the events can be twisted to say she died, that's what happened.  And let's be honest, Wikipedia and all its children wiki sites are never canon. They can be edited by anyone. I can edit them. I used to be able to edit Lavender's death off the wiki before they locked that page and declared that unless we had something new to add, she's dead. These wikis are run by fans and fans do not dictate what is and its not canon. So, what the wiki thinks is hardly meaningful or impactful in any way.  Therefore, to me, she's alive unless Rowling specifically says otherwise. The wiki can go to hell. They did not publish the books, they are not canon, and they never will be. Sorry for being harsh (though I do hope a wiki moderator is reading this.)  Tl;dr: Lavender is alive. The books supersede, the movies are plain not canon, never were canon, and the wiki sucks."

harrypotter,3dwnhr,Alyys,2,Tue Jul 21 15:52:15 2015 UTC,"I consider movies and books to be separate from each other, first, and I consider the storyline of whichever was created first to be 100% cannon (hence why I still believe Han shot first in Star Wars, even though Lucas himself changed it in a later release of the films.)  So I believe the feebly stirring of Lavender in the books trumps the stillness of her in the movies.  You're correct showing her dead (which is another argument in and of itself) doesn't affect the storyline, so if the director, screen writer, producer etc thought it would be more affecting to show her dead, why wouldn't Rowling go ahead and approve that change?    Again, I'm not telling you that you're wrong, I'm just saying I choose to believe otherwise because her fate is ambiguous."

You have to look at it from a storytelling perspective, not fandom.   Slytherin's main themes in history do not include ""spreading corruption, greed, and hatred"". Slytherin had actually won the House Cup for many years in a row before Harry went to Hogwarts, and Slytherin students like Tom Riddle and Merlin were brilliant, ""exceptional"" pupils. That, in itself, shows that Slytherins are not only ambitious, but also earn top marks and grades, resulting in the top academic scores and accomplishments at Hogwarts.  The Slytherin Quidditch team in the books, despite being accused of cheating, were also known to be formidable foes.  If anything, the other three Houses have shown ""hatred"" in the past due to jealousy over Slytherin winning so many times. In a study done at one convention competition, people were divided among the four Houses. The Slytherins were actually found to be the least likely of the Houses to cheat, and also won due to working hard and striving to have the best quality work. Similarly on Reddit, we of /r/slytherin also work very hard, putting a lot of thought, effort, and quality into our homework assignments and participation each month.  In its history, Slytherin has also consistently produced excellency in those of the House that become teachers and instructors, many of whom come back to teach at Hogwarts. Some have even served as Headmasters and Headmistresses at Hogwarts.   So, in Hogwarts's history, Slytherin was just fine until Voldemort's first rise to power."

It's the same as taking gossip as truth, and you are ignoring the thousands of Slytherins throughout the centuries who have actually been normal, productive members of magical society (not to mention Merlin). Merlin was a Slytherin and a big supporter of Muggles, Muggle-borns, and living and coexisting peacefully with non-magical folk. He did a lot of good. To label Slytherins as ""corrupted, greedy, and hateful"" is a farce and blatantly untrue."
harrypotter,3dv2qd,Obversa,-3,Mon Jul 20 02:34:01 2015 UTC,"So the sorting hats warnings in 5 and 6 mean nothing? ""Slytherin took only pure blood wizards""  sounds like he hated mudbloods to me. Book 5 chapter 11."
harrypotter,3dv2qd,themoneybadger,5,Mon Jul 20 02:43:19 2015 UTC,"Taking only pure blood wizards doesn't equal ""hating Mudbloods"". There's no evidence that Slytherin even hated Muggle-borns, only that he didn't trust them. Obviously he tolerated them for some time, as he was good friends with Gryffindor and the other Founders. Rowena and Godric also discriminated in taking only the wise and the brave for their students, which isn't any different. It's still discrimination, and it wasn't limited to Slytherin.  Hufflepuff is the only Founder who accepted every witch or wizard who wasn't chosen by the other three."
harrypotter,3dv2qd,Obversa,-2,Mon Jul 20 02:59:34 2015 UTC,"Except slytherin disagreed so strongly that he left the school.  Maybe hate was the wrong word by me. But refusing to teach people based off their blood vs based on the individual themselves are very different.  Slytherin didn't even give people a chance.  Its like saying I dont hate x race I just don't think they have the right to a magical education, regardless of their personal character."
harrypotter,3dv2qd,atwatwaba,5,Mon Jul 20 03:05:40 2015 UTC,"Muggle-borns aren't a ""race"". Race doesn't even exist. It was orginally a flawed concept to begin with, created by and for social Darwinists and eugencists to support their twisted worldview (and the idea of imperialism and slavery). All Muggle-borns are are witches or wizards with Muggle parents. That's it. There are absolutely no differences aside from that.   Except slytherin disagreed so strongly that he left the school.   Considering that he had tolerated Muggle-borns up until that point, I think there was some impetus there that is overlooked. I think Slytherin left the school because of an event involving Muggles attempting to find, and perhaps destroy, Hogwarts. The Viking invasions were also taking place at the time, and Morgana le Fay, a Dark witch, also likely lived during that time. What did Morgana le Fay do? Help lead an army against Camelot, the latter of which Slytherin's own pupil Merlin supported with his pro-Muggle rights.  Morgana, with the aid of her son Mordred, used a Muggle army to attack Camelot, resulting in King Arthur's demise. Coupled with the Viking invasions, Slytherin saw the power that Muggle armies could wield and did not trust Muggle-borns due to their relations to said Muggles, because he feared that Muggles would attack Hogwarts.   It's discrimination, but it would explain why Slytherin went suddenly from tolerating Muggle-borns, to demanding that they be expelled from the school. He did not trust them because he viewed them as a threat to Hogwarts as a whole. It would also explain why he left a huge, killer snake in the Chamber of Secrets that could only be controlled by himself, or his descendants.  I don't think the basilisk was meant to kill all Muggle-borns. I think it was meant as Slytherin's idea of protecting the castle from Muggle invasion."
harrypotter,3dv2qd,cRavenx,4,Mon Jul 20 03:22:24 2015 UTC,"This is awesome and I really hope it's true. I never truly liked the idea that Slytherin was just a bad dude. Otherwise, why would the other founders be friends with him? It makes more sense to me that Slytherin's character was distorted throughout the years to fit people's ill-informed ideals.   I like the idea of the basilisk being for castle defense too."
harrypotter,3dv2qd,Obversa,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:00:00 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with the fact that the ""Slytherins are evil"" stereotype is not 100% true, but I find it hard to believe that the basilisk wasn't meant to kill people. It's an enormously dangerous creature that only has to look to kill! So that's not really that great of Salazar... Typically killers are closer to the category of evil than good.  Of course, just because Salazar had the intent to kill people (if he did) doesn't mean that all Slytherins are evil. The house was founded off of ambition and cunning, not off of everything that Salazar did. And besides, Houses can grow and evolve."
harrypotter,3dv2qd,cavelioness,2,Mon Jul 20 20:09:44 2015 UTC,"Yet, out of all of the Muggle-borns in Hogwarts, the basilisk, 90% of the time, seems to only petrify. The only person it actually killed was Moaning Myrtle, and her death was confirmed by Rowling to be used by Tom Riddle to create his first Horcrux - the Diary. Riddle also says in Chamber of Secrets, ""I don't care about killing mudbloods anymore"" [with the basilisk].   It's an enormously dangerous creature that only has to look to kill!   That's why he put it, according to Pottermore, in an enchanted sleep that lasted for about a thousand years. The basilisk could also only be controlled by his heirs or descendants, and the Chamber could also only be opened by a Parselmouth. Seeing as how there are very few Parselmouths that attend Hogwarts, the basilisk was relatively secured in the Chamber for several centuries."

For instance, in POA with the time turners, in HBP with the memories and the Horcrux hunt, and even on his deathbed in the astronomy tower. He's calm and collected, trying to talk Draco out of killing him. An lastly, in DH2, in King's Cross Station, he is very calm and wise when he answers Harry's questions"

Dobby can't just pick up Malfoy's boxers and be free."
harrypotter,3dw4p3,rayyychul,2,Mon Jul 20 02:48:57 2015 UTC,"Indeed so.  It seems like the intent of handing doesn't necessarily matter, just that the master does in fact hand it over.

harrypotter,3dw4p3,BadLuckNovelist,2,Mon Jul 20 02:57:26 2015 UTC,"It seems like that would be a loophole, but I don't personally think it would work.   I imagine the intent to hand something to the elf has to be there. So, Lucius hands Dobby the book with the sock. Dobby is freed because, although Lucius didn't mean to give Dobby the sock, he definitely meant to give Dobby the book. There just happened to be a sock in there, which sucks for Lucius. He obviously wasn't intending to free his elf, but he (technically) deliberately gave the sock to Dobby."

I really think Lucius was just furious that his plan to discredit Arthur was foiled and wasn't thinking clearly.     I think the problem with house elves and the rules for granting freedom are exacerbated by the movies changing the sock to being inside the diary (IIRC). As it would mean that you couldn't even hand a house elf luggage to carry to a room without it meaning that they are then freed."

harrypotter,3dw4p3,rayyychul,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:08:52 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly this. I has to do with intent. Like Hermione in GOF, she couldn't have freed the Hogwarts' elves even if she tried because she wasn't their master. That's why I think SPEW was a horrible page filler."

I'm sure it's much more obvious if a wizard actually intends to give the item to the elf.   Edit: also, I feel like even if it were an accident, most elves wouldn't just be like ""okay peace out"", they'd probably say nothing or be like ""uh Master?"" and then their owner would be like ""silly me! I love you Flopsy, go make dinner."" The Malfoys probably are very careful about it because they know they're assholes and they know that Dobby knows too much for them to risk him leaving (not that that really worked out...)"

Couldn't the same be done for the laundry? I mean, I guess I can't really imagine people like the Malfoys bothering with even that simple of a task themselves, but if it's to prevent their servants from leaving maybe they would."
harrypotter,3durad,Obversa,12,Sun Jul 19 17:52:58 2015 UTC,I've always thought that this sort of supported the idea that students are sorted according to what traits they value rather than what they have already. Pettigrew probably admired courage and thought it was something to strive for at that point in time (though he apparently didn't strive hard enough).
harrypotter,3durad,PM_ME_UR_AMPERSANDS,14,Sun Jul 19 22:51:54 2015 UTC,Sorta like a failed Neville?
harrypotter,3durad,BritishBear,10,Sun Jul 19 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I wonder, if Peter had had different influences on him, he would have turned out as brave as Neville did. With that line of thinking, I'm beginning to think of the Hat's sorting system as one designed to help students become their ideal selves."
harrypotter,3durad,PM_ME_UR_AMPERSANDS,4,Sun Jul 19 23:37:39 2015 UTC,Peter learnt that the strong bully the weak and therefore he should associate himself with powerful people else he'd become a victim.   Neville learnt that the strong encourage and help others (I think from Hermione mostly but of course the rest of the gang).   I really hasn't thought about it until BritishBeer's comment but it makes a lot of sense!
harrypotter,3durad,Bwyd,3,Mon Jul 20 07:27:52 2015 UTC,"It certainly makes Hermiones sort a lot more sense. She was already brainy and enjoyed the pursuit of knowledge, but going into Gryffindor made her better because it encouraged the less developed traits she had."
harrypotter,3durad,BritishBear,2,Mon Jul 20 11:06:04 2015 UTC,"I feel like it better supports the idea that the Hat can see all your potential and would push you towards your 'best' self by sorting you into the appropriate house. Unfortunately, Peter didn't fulfill that potential, instead drifting further and further away from it"
harrypotter,3durad,Eaglemeele,6,Mon Jul 20 04:55:45 2015 UTC,"/u/kemistreekat, just as a friendly suggestion, maybe you and the mods could discuss adding this answer to the ""common questions"" section?"
harrypotter,3durad,YamadaDesigns,2,Sun Jul 19 17:55:19 2015 UTC,I guess it would be the same reason Harry was almost put in Slytherin.
harrypotter,3durad,hollywoodhoracehogan,2,Mon Jul 20 04:26:50 2015 UTC,Maybe he asked?   The fact that families seem to often end in the same house always kind of slightly implied to me that asking would make it more likely you end up in that house.  Plus do you think you're the same person at 20 you are at 11? Sorting does happen too soon.
