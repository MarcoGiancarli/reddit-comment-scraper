NorwayPics,3bi9f7,InhalingIcicles,2,Mon Jun 29 19:08:20 2015 UTC,"Det gick inte att köra där alls faktiskt, lite längre fram på vägen blev det bråstopp där större delar av vägen rasat ut av ett vattenfall (det går även att se att vägen även verkar vara översnöad på vissa ställen längre bort). Så vi blev tvungna att göra en kärv vändning och bege oss tillbaka.  Det roligaste med hela historien var att vi även blev tvungna att backa en stor bit av vägen först eftersom vi mötte en stor bil som kom åt andra hållet när vi försökte köra in där första gången, vilket även fick oss att tro att det gick att köra hela vägen. Och så klart den optimistiska skylten i början som hälsade att vägen var ""väl värd en tur"".  Men trotts allt var det nog värt det, vägarna uppe i Haukeli är nog en av de vackraste ställena jag varit på. Hade gärna försökt ta mig an den vägen igen utan bil också, kunde varit ett härligt äventyr."

NorwayPics,37l30y,male_specimen,1 point,Thu May 28 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"Definitely can't bring a bicycle, except if you're willing to carry it on your back for an hour getting up the moutain :D  The height difference in such a short trail means very steep paths, and most of it was trails on big stones.  You can get up to the sheep farm on the road (Westerås Gard, near road 63). MAYBE do a few hundred meters in bicycle (if you have a dirt one), but after that it's 100% on foot."

NorwayPics,373dba,TheLostCrusader,1 point,Mon May 25 14:02:57 2015 UTC,Looks a bit overshopped.
NorwayPics,373dba,Voicy,2,Sun May 24 15:52:30 2015 UTC,"To be fair, to capture these accurately to how they look in person, you need to use quite a long exposure (notice the blurriness of the water, a typical point in longer exposures). Our eyes adjust automatically to low light, camera lenses need to be fiddled with in order to replicate what we see. That means keeping the camera stable, using a large aperture, longer shutter speed, and often boosting the ISO sensitivity (at the cost of image smoothness, as you can see by the noise here).  I think the only post-processing this image may have had done to it was a slight increase in saturation and vibrance. The rest is all camera."
NorwayPics,373dba,Voicy,1 point,Sun May 24 15:54:04 2015 UTC,"I've found shorter exposures (typically 5-8sec) more accurately depict them, since up here in the north when you see any variant to the green, chances are its moving quite fast so you won't have water blur.   What made me question it is the amount of light on the right side. I've never once seen aurora with that much light and still get the colour variant flashes.   My aurora hunting buddy takes great shots of them but often touches them up more than what I feel should be allowed. They make them look better, but less accurate is all I'm trying to say."

NorwayPics,31swfm,DaHitcha,2,Wed Apr 8 20:26:09 2015 UTC,"For anyone that was curious, since some kind stranger gilded me, here's how i ended up here. I like when people provide context for photos so ill try my best.  I was heading to a midnight sun music festival on Værøy, departing from Moskenes (southern end of Lofoten archipelago) via ferry, and fell asleep, missing my destination and waking up here, confused. There are no people on Røst in the summer, as it's a fishing island that bustles in the winter, but in the 24 hours i was there, outside of the hotel I saw 3 people at the supermarket (only store on the island) including the cashier, 1 cat, and 1 car.   When I arrived , it was raining and i went straight to the first shelter which was a hotel, and one of maybe two places to stay on the island. I woke up some hours later, and took one of the free rental bikes for a spin around the island. That took about 20 mins and i covered every possible road. It was eerily silent and cloudy, it was the most peaceful place I had ever been.  The next day i did a bird watching tour, something i'd never thought i'd say, and it was one of the most amazing things i did in Norway. We were on a high speed raft, everyone else was a Norwegian tourist, and the guide translated everything to english for me. This island and many others are basically uninhabited except for a few small cabins and farmhouses."

NorwayPics,308ikh,liamt07,2,Thu Mar 26 02:07:49 2015 UTC,"Borgund Stave Church (Nynorsk: Borgund stavkyrkje, Bokmål: Borgund stavkirke) is a stave church located in the village of Borgund in the municipality of Lærdal in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway. It is classified as a triple nave stave church of the so-called Sogn-type. This is also the best preserved of Norway's 28 extant stave churches. The church is part of the Borgund parish in the Indre Sogn deanery in the Diocese of Bjørgvin, although it is no longer used regularly for church functions, it is now used as a museum and it is run by the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments.   ""Stave church"":   A stave church is a medieval wooden Christian church building once common in north-western Europe. The name derives from the buildings' structure of post and lintel construction, a type of timber framing where the load-bearing posts are called stafr in Old Norse and stav in modern Norwegian."

NorwayPics,2zir3u,The_dog_says,15,Thu Mar 19 00:40:01 2015 UTC,"All I know is that in Svalbard, you must carry a high calibre rifle if you're travelling outside a settlement, because of polar bears."

NorwayPics,2zir3u,Pesshau,3,Thu Mar 19 15:04:02 2015 UTC,"Here are the firearmrules at Svalbard http://www.sysselmannen.no/en/Shortcuts/Firearms/  Note that firearmlaws at Svalbard differs from the mainland.  At the mainland: You have to be an acitve member of a pistolclub to own a pistol. To buy a shotgun or rifle you first have to take ""jaktprøven"" a hunters test. No full auto weapons are allowed. And rifles with more that 5 bullets are not allowed at hunting. Though you can buy ex. an AR15 for competition shooting. I have no idea of the waiting period, but i presume its probably a couple of months.   The University at Svalbard loan out weapons to tourist. I`ve heard stories that students were given a 15 minuttes tutorial with a rifle before they go outside.   Also Persons that do not have a firearm permit may apply to the Governor for a permit to rent a firearm. http://www.sysselmannen.no/en/Shortcuts/Firearms/Renting-firearms/"
NorwayPics,2zir3u,Puleband,3,Thu Mar 19 08:18:00 2015 UTC,"All UNIS students are required to participate in a 1-day rifle training, where each student practices half-loading the rifle and fires at least 12 shots. Rifles are then only issued to students who managed to hit a 25 cm diameter target at 30 metres distance, with 4 rounds.  Surely it's not a difficult procedure to go through, even if you've never shot a handgun before, but UNIS takes this rifle business quite serious.  -[edit; grammar]"
NorwayPics,2zir3u,hooahguy,2,Thu Mar 19 09:33:58 2015 UTC,"From what I know, hunting rifles and shotguns are ok to use, but only if you have a permit for it of course. And from what I know, permits are only given for valid reasons for needing it like hunting or sport. Handguns are much more regulated, and much harder to get."
