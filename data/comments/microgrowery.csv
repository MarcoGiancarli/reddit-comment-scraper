microgrowery,3e3bjr,howlermonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:50:35 2015 UTC,"I planted her on the first week of April and she's been outdoors her entire life. I had her growing in a pot up until June 10th since she appeared to be outgrowing it. Absolutely no shock issues, she actually looked perked up and happy by the next morning. She was about 2-2.5 feet tall (she barely reached above my knees) when she was transplanted."
microgrowery,3e3bjr,conspiracy_thug,4,Tue Jul 21 22:42:33 2015 UTC,"You should be supercropping the fuck out of that thing.  Get rid of those long scraggly branches by cutting the plant into a rounder shape.  Also, cut out anything on the inside that gets 30% or more shade all day, includinguttle branches. If you leave it, they will turn Into airy bammer popcorn that's total dildos do deal with.

If ruderalis grows tall, this could also be a factor, i don't know. But even the buds have sort of sativa traits."

The ratio of Big Bloom is only 0.01-0.3-0.7 (NPK) and that won't grow you good cannabis.  It has virtually NO nitrogen, potassium or phosphorous in it and that is what makes plants grow big (and green).  Big Bloom is really only 1 part of the 3 part system for fox farms (it contains only the micronutrients).

Remember feel what the pot feels like before watering and then after and always water when it feels like it did to begin with. But they look very perky and happy. I like to reiterate this to people, overwatering is watering to the point the media can not dry out. (ie: watering every day when your media doesn't allow, watering seedlings too much before they have adequate root structure to remove the water from the media.) As long as it is drying out you wont over water, just go by how heavy they feel. In a week youll have the hang of it. They are really going to get thirsty soon."

microgrowery,3e4bff,PriceZombie,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:17:02 2015 UTC,"The heat will be a problem?   Oh yeah... You're basically running a 400W heater above the plants, so if you don't have a way to remove the heat, it'll build up and be a real problem.  Cannabis does best at temps under 84° F.  You're also going to have to figure out how to get rid of the smell as well.  I would invest in something like this as it will take care of both problems.  You're going to need to figure out where to exhaust the heat.   Will more wattage cause the plant to wilt or something?   Nope.  The 50w/sq ft is just a recommendation, not a stern requirement; worse case is that you're just 'wasting' the light.  I run at 62.5W/sq ft in my garden and it's wonderful.   I would have thought being under would be better.   Not at all.  Light and growing skill are the single largest factors when calculating yield."

microgrowery,3e33dm,JeF4y,-1,Tue Jul 21 23:52:56 2015 UTC,"Definitely not light shock...you will never accomplish anything with those lights. You need better lights (LED or HPS), you need better soil...get better equipment and start over imo."
microgrowery,3e39h1,Loguer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:56:38 2015 UTC,Can you elaborate?  I had a 3x3 tray and a 26 gallon reservoir. Really could have used a slightly bigger res.  Used Lucas formula with maxi bloom.  I could grow up to 36 plants in it. The beauty of the system is you can grow tons of small single cola plants with no topping.  You can also grow a smaller number and top and and train.
microgrowery,3e39h1,djwonderful,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:10 2015 UTC,"I was just curious as to what the best configuration would be.  I was planning on a 26 gallon reservoir and a cement mixing tray on top of it, but I feel like the plant roots would get too much light exposure."
microgrowery,3e39h1,djwonderful,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:07:17 2015 UTC,No. The roots stay in the pot and grow a little bit out the bottom.   You can also just fill the entire cement tub with hydrotron.. but I hear that is a pain to clean up.
microgrowery,3e4udf,bengtal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:37:11 2015 UTC,"in the third pic i pulled aside 3 vegging seedlings as an example. the two closer plants don't look so happy right now, but the third plant in the back (jacks cleaner 2) is planted in the same mixture and looks great. The yellower, down-curved leaf seedlings were being eaten by thrips a week or two ago, so i sprayed with spinosad and the trips are gone i'm pretty sure. could the unhealthy state of my seedlings be a consequence of the thrip attack earlier? otherwise it looks kind of like my plants did when my soil was too acidic, but i have amended my mix since then (including oyster shell among other things) and my plants are otherwise loving the mix. its time to water them today anyway, i'm hoping they will come around. any thoughts or advice are welcome !"

To answer your other question you can get along jus fine without using any nutes for the first few weeks, since my clones were a bit on the large side when I potted them I started nutes about 2.5 weeks into veg. Total veg time was only about 50 days. Plants showed no signs of stress or nute burn once I started either so I think I could have probably started feeding right away if I wanted to but that would probably be a waste of money."

The one on the left looks like some kind of sativa. And sativas will stretch and stay in vegging longer (from my experience). How much sun are they getting?   Edit: I meant to respond to the comment

microgrowery,3dzdcy,JBird99,0,Mon Jul 20 19:37:47 2015 UTC,The picture of the yellowish leaf is the only leaf on the plant that is yellow so that doesn't really match nitrogen deficienty and it's at the very bottom of the plant so I don't think it's mites seeing as it was touching the ground.

Second photo is just old leaves falling off because they are the very early leaves that worked hard to get the plant started. Perfectly healthy plants will drop some older fan leaves right about the time they get as big as your plant. Suppose you had a nitrogen deficiency..... You would see all The leaves at the bottom start to turn yellow simultaneously and moving up the plant. That's not happening here. Your plant is just shedding old tired out leaves that are no longer contributing more sugar than they consume   Third photo might be mites.

Bring someone else's car to the hydro store or wherever you plan on buying grow equipment. Don't tell anyone you grow, no matter how close they are to you (girlfriend, brother/sister, etc). People talk, and say things they really shouldn't, especially when they're high/drunk.

First off, always start your plants at 1/4 or 1/2 what ever the bottle states to give to your plants.  Meaning you should be adding 1 tsp a and 1/2 tsp b to a gallon of water.  Most people give nutrients every other or every 3rd watering.  Make sure that the soil is nice and dry between each waterings.  (It's ok to let the plant begin to wilt just a tiny tiny bit before giving more water)  Over the next couple feedings increase to full strength nutes and be sure to watch for nutrient burn.

The KoolBloom they refer to is a 0-10-10 nutrient that will help bulk up buds during flowering. I use KoolBloom and FloraNova (similar to yours) and get good results by following their schedule. Dudeyaman is right, check your pH. Mine would be close to 5.0 after mixing nutes if I didn't adjust pH. That would be bad for plants."

microgrowery,3dwfyr,madilyn02,23,Mon Jul 20 02:36:35 2015 UTC,"These are great, but only if your growing situation allows you to use them safely and according to the labeling. If you cannot do that, these are a terrible choice and not safe at all.  Absolutely not in any occupied living space whatsoever. You can only safely use these in a location like a garage or shed that is not connected to your living space. Edit: a safe garage does not have any ventilation connection to the house. If the garage is heated/airconditioned, then it is part of the occupied living space and is not a safe place to use this chemical.  Brief exposure such as the few minutes one needs to water and check plants daily, is safe, as mammalian toxicity is very low because it is rapidly metabolized by the body. The label advises no more than 4 hours exposure per day.  Also, dichlorvos is a good choice in the grow room, because of it's rapid degradation into safe, non-toxic substances.  So why does a militant organic gardener like myself use this stuff? Because I work in an organic community garden every day so it is impossible for me to avoid bringing home lots of garden pests every single day to my medical grow. This is the one place I can make a small compromise and get a huge benefit. If I did not use these, I would literally be fighting a non-stop battle against the critters I bring home to my grow every day.  I simply cannot afford to risk my health by not having a safe supply of my medical cannabis. Analytical test results which also test for pesticide presence do not detect this chemical even when it is used during the last week of flowering. This is because it breaks down into non-toxic compounds quickly, and is never actually applied to the plants.  Or course, it is up to all of us to weigh the risks and benefits of our growing choices.   Here is a comprehensive and generally understandable description of the properties and hazards of using this stuff.   http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/extoxnet/carbaryl-dicrotophos/dichlorvos-ext.html  As a former quality control analytical chemist in the pharmaceutical industry, I've satisfied myself that this is a safe way for me in my own particular growing situation to prevent pests. I know that it does not directly deposit onto the plants like a spray would, that it degrades rapidly in the presence of water and light, that it is metabolized and excreted rapidly by mammals, and that I am using this product according to the label to ensure maximum safety.  For many, this should be considered absolutely off limits, especially if you are growing in a bedroom closet like many here do. But if your growing situation allows and warrants it, these can be a great way to go.   If I was unable to use this, I would use Neem oil on my plants every week until flowering and then hope for the best."

If the vented air is being sucked directly outside and the tent is constantly getting fresh air I feel like this would be ok.    The exhaust fan would of course be powerful enough to prevent air from the tent getting outside the tent as it effectively creates a vacuum.  Is that sound?

It never actually deposits onto the plants, nor does it persist very long due to its rapid degradation.   So it's actually not anything like spraying plants with a much more persistent liquid insecticide you would directly spray on a roach.

You can tell if yellowing is caused by too much nitrogen because the rest of the plant will be dark green, and the yellowing leaves will turn into claws first.

When you do this you risk creating bugs that are resistant to that chemical. Also you should rotate active ingredients to prevent immunity also.  Azamax, and all the other ""aza"" products, are simply concentrated neem oil. Neem oil is not a contact killer. It prevents juveniles from maturing, it helps to suppress appetite and makes the plant smell/taste bad to the bugs. Once you actually spray the bugs with an aza product it is going to take anywhere from days to a week before those bugs die. Now if you used a contact killer they'd be dead in 20 min.  Rotate active ingredient, don't use diluted pesticide and get a contact killer. These 3 steps will help you battle these bitches."

microgrowery,3dxmzp,tinjah4,5,Mon Jul 20 11:24:02 2015 UTC,"Science!    In nature, the chloroplasts inside the plant's cells gradually migrate to the anticlinal cell walls and cluster there, trying to avoid direct sunlight as it is too intense and can cause oxidative damage to chlorophyll. I could go way down a rabbit hole  and point out that this is why there is such a thing as too much light in a grow tent; at some point your lights cause cytoplasmic streaming and photosynthesis actually decreases.      The oxidative damage to plants is most frequently seen with LED growers who have their lights turn on full brightness instantaneously, giving the chloroplasts no chance to 'run and hide'. Hence, bleaching. Having your lights come on slowly (over a period of 5 minutes) would theoretically help decrease the chances of oxidative damage, however every set up is different."

Since your not getting new outside air in the room you have to add co2 with a tank ,controller and regulator ($400) to keep the plants happy as they use co2 much like we use oxygen. What is nice is you can add more co2 then what is in the air outside and this allows the plants to be grow well in temps up to the mid 80s."
microgrowery,3dxs8l,noseasguey,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:39:45 2015 UTC,RH is ~55 so I can't go up any more there but I do notice a big difference in how hard the a/c works relative to the dehumid setting. I am pretty well sealed up and used oversized sugar/yeast co2 gens for the last grow (I only vented once a day then). I can scrounge funds for a co2 setup like you listed but am also looking at LED but can't bring myself to abandon the 1kw setup I just sourced last February.
microgrowery,3dxs8l,Jaysallday,2,Mon Jul 20 20:36:46 2015 UTC,"1kw of HPS uses the same amount of electricity as a TRUE 1kw LED set up. I use MARS II LED panel in a 5x5x7 tent, I have 4 of the 400w so in theory I'm suppose to have about 1600 watts but in reality it only draws about 720w out the outlet. I like them, but I think I should of bought more panels or stronger panels to truly pull 1kw. The only difference I notice between hps vs led is with leds the buds look a little frostier, nodes are definitely tighter and barely noticeable denser buds. The benefit of HPS is your able to collect the heat better to remove it from your tent, on LED's its slightly cooler by about 4-8 degrees but the heat it puts off becomes tricky to collect. Benefit of LED, I can veg & flower with same panel + most likely I wont have to replace any lights for at lease 2-3 years where as hps is every 6 months of use which is about every 2 grows."

microgrowery,3dxs8l,003n1gm400,2,Mon Jul 20 22:26:40 2015 UTC,"You need a bigger window unit or more of them. My electric bill was running close to $600 (FL heat) because I was running my central AC, along with grow room, and all other household things you could imagine. My grow room accounts for around $125 a month.  I turned off the central AC, and got a 15k window to cool the living room/kitchen. That alone brought my electric bill down to $350. I have to turn on the central ac at night to cool the bedrooms at the moment, but if I got more window units for the bedrooms I would drop my electric bill even more."

For whatever reason, when colloidal silver solution is sprayed regularly on a  female cannabis plants during the early flowering stage, she will grow male ""balls"" (which are full of female pollen) instead of growing buds.  This allows the grower to collect pollen from afemale cannabis plant. You can use this all-female pollen to pollinate another female plant. With two female plants as parents, ALL the seeds will end up being female.  That is why colloidal silver allows can be used create female x female cannabis crosses and produce your own feminized seeds."

Geographically, indoor, outside, greenhouse?  They all determine major aspects of the operation. Which fish species will tolerate the climate year round..   Another argument/issue I've been reading about regarding aquaponics had been fish might not be enough or people overstock the fish to get better results.  Check into adding worms for extra waste breakdown.    The symbiotic relationship is fish shit poisons the fish but plants love fish shit.

They're are a few good DIY methods that I'm too lazy to Google right now but essentially you can get everything from Walmart for around 20$ and it will work just as good as that big one.

There's some videos on the actual wattage being pulled which is around 50 watts full speed which is half of anything nice out there. And it's very strong and better made. Controller is nice if you want it to barely run which is all you would need for that room so even lower actual draw. Damnit I'm regretting not getting it now lol hurricanes had good reviews too and you can also tune em down but you gotta buy the controller separate..

It just needs something to give it a boost in photosynthesis at those branches to be able to have the energy to throw out the real leaves.
microgrowery,3du3r8,Negative__One,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:41:01 2015 UTC,Do you have a pic of before you chopped the buds off? Where did you cut the plant? I plan to cut mine right in the middle of the stalk and keep just the lower leaves.
microgrowery,3du3r8,Negative__One,3,Sun Jul 19 14:30:49 2015 UTC,"I cut the main branch about 2/3s down, literally just left a few low shoots on with probably 6/7 little buds between them.  I mean small, the type of buds you'd normally throw into your trimmings.  Literally used a bread knife to trim 50% off the rootball, added new soil and replanted back into the same pot.  Added 150% strength veg nutes for the first watering, and have treated them like normally vegging plants since then.  This was about 16 days ago http://imgur.com/hkxfJVG"

It's been a month and when I browse this sub it seems that it has made little progress compared to other plants. Having said that, it does only get afternoon sun (outdoor grow on the balcony of a flat). Could that be the cause?"
microgrowery,3dugfi,Trees4twenty,2,Sun Jul 19 18:03:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, it should be growing faster. They need a good six hours of direct light in addition to indirect during the rest of the day. Also, remember that many pictures you see here are of indoor plants grown under 24/7 lighting at carefully controlled humidity and temperature, so you will be slower just die to those factors you cannot control."

microgrowery,3dugfi,smartbrowsering,3,Sun Jul 19 18:27:35 2015 UTC,"Normal for the cotyledons to drop, but your plant does look like more of a lime green than the deep, dark green that it should have, which could indicate a hungry plant. Also, I don't see anything in your soil mix at all that looks like it helps with drainage. If that pot is staying wet for more than a few days at a time, you need more drainage. The soil you have looks like straight up garden soil, which will not drain anywhere near well enough in a pot.  It also looks more spindly than it should be. What kind of light do you have it under? Looks like it might be outside, what kind of exposure does it have? Anything other than southern exposure probably isn't going to get enough light to the plants to have very good results."

Hydro is cool, i don't use it anymore, just as a personal preference,   I prefer a nice simple setup, organic, low maintenance.   The biggest thing I have found is that it's not what you grow in, it's how you grow it,  topping and lollypopping are two things that will make a good grow great and well worth practicing a little. I always look to invest in a bit better gear after a grow,  let the hobby pay for itself, for instance, after this one I'm going to get a second 400watt hps in the room and a good fan/carbon filter.   My advice, for what it's worth(fuck all),  is to go super simple if your confused,  learn from experience,  upgrade to hydro,   buy the best tent, light, fan, that you can afford,  learn how to train the plant, then get technical with hydro.

Here is where I found someone using it. Thread goes from seed to harvest with 1 vero 29 2.7K 90 CRI and 1 vero 29 5K 80 CRI.   http://www.rollitup.org/t/bridgelux-vero-29-led-test.702193/  The 2.7K 97 CRI is a new chip and does not come in the vero 29 size. It is easier to drive the vero 18s than it is the 29s because the 29s use from 2-3 Amps each and it can get pricey for a good driver that can do that.   I have fought the same anti LED battle for reef tanks and fought the constant miss information and I will continue to do so for growing.   All those LED builds with a ton of 1W leds are cheap, innefecient and you are grtting ripped off when you pay $200-500 for them. This LED light cost me $200 and it will provide a wider, smoother and closer to a HPS/MH bulb light than using red and blue leds will."

microgrowery,3dun3z,LEDwizard,2,Sun Jul 19 17:46:16 2015 UTC,"Wattage is one of the worst measurements of light there is. A 20W LED and a different 20W LED can provide completely different PAR, spectrum and light quality."
microgrowery,3dun3z,LEDwizard,4,Mon Jul 20 00:35:54 2015 UTC,"Well sure. But still 160w is not much for 6 sqft. Are you under the impression that 160w of light from these will out perform higher wattage LEDs in the same space? Spectrum and lumens are important, but I still think you need more than 160w in a 6 sqft space."
microgrowery,3dun3z,LEDwizard,0,Mon Jul 20 00:50:17 2015 UTC,"Yea thats exactly what I think this will outperform a commerci fixture of 200-300W  So assume im wanting a flowering led set up which fixtures on the market use all red LEDs in the 640-660nm range. These LEDs are usually bridgelux 1W LEDs. On occasion they will have Cree which will drive the fixture price up even more.   Bridgelux 1W leds at 660nm are usually about 20-30 lumens (cree and phillips rebel are 3W leds and usually are about 70-120 lumens)  One of these bridgelux vero 18 2700K 97CRI ran at 1.3 amps is about 3500 lumens and 40W. Even 40W of bridgelux leds is not close to the vero 18.   Although not all 3500 lumens are in that same deep red spectrum, it provides a closer replica of light to the sun which grows cannabis the best. Cannabis can and will grow under red and royal blue leds, but cannabis is a complex plant and complex plants require a large range of spectrum to photosynthesis with.   Heres the data on the 97 cri dexor series. Page 18 (27E graph line) shows the spectral output of these, theres a seperate spectral output for the 4K one and its peaks are more in the 430-480nm range and less in the 600nm range like the 2.7K."
microgrowery,3dun3z,LEDwizard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:34:26 2015 UTC,I think the disconnect is around your claiming that spectrum and lumens are king and watts don't matter. You clearly understand that watts matter too or else why not just use one of each chip? I'd be curious to see how results compare between 160w of Vero chips compared to 300w or so of cheap Chinese 100w COB LEDs.
microgrowery,3dun3z,LEDwizard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:19:41 2015 UTC,"Watts do matter, but I didnt use 1 of each chip because that would have been barely below enough so I doubled it to have more than enough. The trouble with a chinese one would be finding a white that is as warm as these (lots of red)"
microgrowery,3dun3z,VTGreenery,2,Mon Jul 20 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"These LEDs are usually bridgelux 1W LEDs. On occasion they will have Cree which will drive the fixture price up even more.   Where have you seen these fixtures with 1W LEDs? 3W and 5W are predominant in the industry, virtually no one reputable is even manufacturing 1W LEDs now.     One of these bridgelux vero 18 2700K 97CRI ran at 1.3 amps is about 3500 lumens and 40W. Even 40W of bridgelux leds is not close to the vero 18.     You cannot use lumens to describe an LEDs photosynthetic efficiency and compare two LEDs. You just can't. Lumens are scored based on the human eye's receptivity to various wavelengths, thus a light source with a lot of green produces a lot more lumens/Watt of input power than say, a deep red LED that consumes the same amount of power. So when you say:       ""Bridgelux 1W leds at 660nm are usually about 20-30 lumens (cree and phillips rebel are 3W leds and usually are about 70-120 lumens)""     People are going to be dismissive because no one (reputable) in the LED industry uses lumens to describe the output power of red or blue LEDs. For instance here's LEDEngin's data sheet for their LZ4 in 660nm red. They rate their output in watts of flux, not one mention of lumens to be found. So when you are comparing the lumen output of deep red LEDs to a white Vero18 you are not really comparing apples to apples.    Your Vero18's are great, don't get me wrong. Everyone that uses them loves them, they are highly efficient and 100% of their output is PAR. You can drive them at a higher wattage than Chinese COBs due to them being so much more efficient. Just be careful about making extraordinary claims."
microgrowery,3dun3z,LEDwizard,0,Mon Jul 20 14:35:53 2015 UTC,"You can use lumens to describe and compare a white and colored LEDs. In my previous reply I did say the entire lumen count of a vero 18 is not in the same spectrum as a deep red led so the lumens are an exact estimation of the amount of red, but if you look at the spectral output on the vero 18 2700K it has almost 100% of the relative intensity centered over 660 nm with only 35% relative intensity in the blue spectrum.   If you found the area under the spectral curve from 600-700nm and compared that to the area under the curve from 400-600nm you would find that the 2700K vero 18s have about 75% of their light output in the 600-700nm range. Even 75% of their 3400 total lumens is 2500 lumens in the 600-700nm range and this range peaks at 660nm the same as deep red.   The reason I converted the red leds from their mW rating to lumens is to have a relatable number from white to a colored led. Comparing the lumens of a white LED in the same nm range as a colored led is a perfectly acceptable form of comparison. You cant compare apples and oranges because theirs no conversion rate, but you can convert mW to lm using math. Its just like converting from feet to meters, its a different unit, but it measures the same thing with lumens taking into account the nm. You can work backward too a vero 18 and convert the 2500lm in the 600-700nm, peaked at 660 and convert that to mW.   Lumens are a direct relationship to PAR and the PUR.   Most fixtures do use lower quality leds, you are right they are 3W but the ones they choose do not have high outputs compared to other 3W leds.   The G8 240W light, I am positive these 4 LEDs can outperform this fixture especially since they also recommend a 80W ufo for flowering and I will be using these 4 from start to harvest."
microgrowery,3dun3z,ChippyMalone,2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:24 2015 UTC,"Comparing the lumens of a white LED in the same nm range as a colored led is a perfectly acceptable form of comparison.    This would only be true if you had actually converted with the right correction factor. If 75% of the vero18 is outputting between 660-700nm, you need to apply a correction factor based on each wavelength similar to the green curve shown here: http://www.econoluxindustries.com/Technology/CIE%20Vs%20PAR%20curves.png As you can see, the conversion from watts to lumens at 660nm requires a correction factor of .05 or lower, the closer to 700 you get. The same is true on the blue end of the spectrum.    I'm sorry to say it's not as simple as just running a hand-calc."
microgrowery,3dun3z,VTGreenery,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:06:27 2015 UTC,Using the luminous efficacy K formula and assuming 25% of the total lumens has the same 660nm peak shape as a deep red led and with the .05 shift from your graph its still over 800mW of 660nm deep red which only uses 10W to achieve this. This combined with all the other red spectrum that it outputs and cannabis will use to grow is a much more electricity efficient way and equally if not better as far as the growth and spectrum of light provided compared to the colored led set ups.   The 4K vero 18 provides almost all of the blue spectrum and a little bit of red up to 640nm. It also provides the 500-600nm section which the plants dont use but helps us visually see better so we can inspect the plants. Its quite difficult to look at anything under 200W of red LEDs.
microgrowery,3dun3z,ChippyMalone,2,Mon Jul 20 17:02:03 2015 UTC,"is a much more electricity efficient way and equally if not better as far as the growth and spectrum of light provided compared to the colored led set ups.   Nah. To create a white LED you must first use a blue LED and give it a phosphor coating which causes the blue photons to be down-converted into a spectrum. Chemists adjust the makeup of the phosphor coating to achieve 'warmer' or 'cooler' white light. In order to get red photons this way, you are paying for the extra energy to emit a blue photon, then you are wasting a lot of that energy as heat as it is absorbed and re-emitted through the phosphor coating. A regular red LED needs not go through this process. So for example a blue/white 3W LED generally runs at 3.2-3.4V, while a 3W red consumes the same power but only runs at 2.2-2.4V, so you can see there's a huge energy savings to just go straight red than to try to derive a percentage of red from a blue-turned-white."

microgrowery,3dtkfi,Trees4twenty,0,Sun Jul 19 13:49:00 2015 UTC,"Well since half of each leaf (at least) is still green I don't want to pull them off as it's still photosynthesising as soon as the whole leaf (or at least 85%) has turned yellow/crispy i lightly pull them off, this is also one of my smaller of the 50 plants I have as it was easier to reach pull out and take a picture of."
microgrowery,3dtkfi,Trees4twenty,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:08:05 2015 UTC,they are rotting and not doing anything but blocking light that could hit other functioning leaves. The best thing to do at this point is to pinch the leaf off where it connects to the stem. this will avoid trauma to the branch itself and in a day or two the stem will pull right off. Having dying leaves can cause issues like pests or when in flower it can cause issues inside the bud itself. thats why when you take a leaf in flower you pinch it like i said above.
microgrowery,3dtkfi,Trees4twenty,0,Sun Jul 19 14:31:18 2015 UTC,"Those leaves are at least 50% green, green leaves are still using photosynthesis, iv never understood any type of removing leaves to promote growing as pulling off leaves require some mending time for the plant, second of all its 3 weeks from being done so some leaves are going to die. this is also my 6th grow and I have tried the removing yellowing leaves, and it always seems like it harms the plant more than helps it. I know a lot of people do try and remove leaves and lolly pop with good results, I just seem to get better results by only removing leaves that need to be taken off. iv also only had a problem with pests when I got my clones from a place infested with spider mites, I quickly got rid of them with neem spray with soap water and haven't had the problem since."
microgrowery,3dtkfi,Trees4twenty,3,Sun Jul 19 14:46:46 2015 UTC,"your leaf isn't even using photosynthesis any longer. Like i stated before, if you just pull a leaf off it can cause damage to the branch, reason for pinching instead of pulling.   As the leaves on the plant begin to age, they eventually reach a point where photosynthesis peaks and begins to slow. At this point, the leaves are less efficient, and glucose productions declines. New leaves grow in to replace them as the primary solar panels, allowing more efficient photosynthesis to continue. The older, less efficient, leaves begin to work much like the root system, distributing their stored nutrients and plant sugars to wherever it is needed. When they have no more nutrients left to redistribute, these leaves will begin to yellow, and eventually fall from the plant.  This is particularly important to remember if you are experiencing root problems. Older leaves may be sacrificed to allow light to shine on fresh growth–but only if you have a healthy, robust root system. If your roots are not well established or are damaged, you may do more harm than good by removing the older leaves.  I should point out that most of the older leaves will be lower on the plant and therefor unlikely to  shade much of the fresh growth. Any fresh growth lower on the plant is probably on shoots and  in the shade of fresh foliage that is closer to the light.  The principles of light and the inverse square law tell us that artificial light intensity quickly diminishes the further you get from the light source. So, you certainly do not want to sacrifice fresh leaves closer to the light for fresh leaves further away.  You can tell that leaves are beginning to give up their nutrients when they start to lose their dark green color. If these fading older leaves are blocking the light from new growth, feel free to remove them. By the time the leaves become pale green, or begin to yellow, they should be removed–even if they are not blocking younger foliage.  Be sure not to remove leaves that have not yet reached their full size, unless they have been damaged by pests. Healthy leaves exposed to the light are facilitating photosynthesis. So your plants require them. http://www.marijuanagrowershq.com/removing-cannabis-leaves-to-maximize-light/"
microgrowery,3dtkfi,Trees4twenty,0,Sun Jul 19 15:03:29 2015 UTC,"Well like I said way more than 50% is green I do remove leaves as they are dying but when only 1-2 of the actual 7 prongs per leaf has gone yellow it still means that there is nutrients in those leaves, and like I said I am removing dying leaves but when you have 50 plants and this is the smallest I think I can be forgiven for leaving a yellowing leaf on there a bit longer, especially when there is only 2-3 discoloured leaves throughout the whole plant, I actually have a whole bin bag full of dead leaves ready for putting in my composter for my vegetable garden next summer. also because I have 50 plants watering them can take upto 1 & 1/5 hours (even longer if I am moving the plants around which I do once a week), so I'm not going to worry about the sub 1% of yellow leaves I have missed."

We are quite good at this now) maybe in flower, the entire plant develops and coats itself into forming giant bud clusters going entirely up and down each branch, stem, leaf..."

microgrowery,3ds5nt,MyWeedGrowingAccount,2,Sat Jul 18 22:58:42 2015 UTC,This is our first plant. She is a Blue Mystic Autoflower from Nirvanashop.   She started her life in a bucket. She quickly outgrew that space so we had to find her a new home.  She is now in a 4'x4'x6.5' grow tent with a single 300 Watt LED panel on a 12/12 light cycle (she is sharing the tent with a photo).   Soil is FFOF with a layer of perlite on the bottom (we have since realized that a layer on the bottom does nothing and have mixed it throughout). She gets FF Trio using a more diluted version of their schedule) she is getting about 600ppm of nutrients at the moment. Watered with RODI water that is pH'd to 6.5.

How  you handle things now, like a girl telling you how you can and cannot enjoy your hobbies, will affect your relationships and quality of life for a long time.  With some things, it's better to just do it now and once it becomes normal to her after a couple grow cycles, you can just never stop to grow peppers and lettuce.

Do you have an intake/return to get fresh air inside?  Also, I'd try to get some more lights on these girls, especially with the wide variety in heights."
microgrowery,3drmxv,fanarc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:16:52 2015 UTC,"A new light is definitely something that I'll get once funds become available! The fan is pushing air in, and I am opening the door for about an hour or so at night to try to clear the air. I've just recently done some supercropping, where I've taken the tallest branches and pushed them nearly horizontal, creating a more even canopy. Any advice on light height? It doesn't have a cooler so I'm worried about it being too close, especially with this heat."
microgrowery,3drmxv,fanarc,2,Sun Jul 19 16:27:32 2015 UTC,"Having an inlet fan is all good, but having no exhaust makes it virtually useless.  You're trying to force air into a sealed box, with no where for the old air to go (except for one hour a day).  No fan, especially a box fan, can over power that amount of pressure.  Since this is your only fan, and it is mounted up high, I would run it as an exhaust.  Have two vents down lower in the room so that cool, fresh air can be drawn in, and have the fan sucking hot air out of the top of your room.  Especially if you aren't running cool tubes or anything, you need to ventilate the heat from your HPS lights.  Definitely recommend 2-4 smaller fans around the room to circulate air; will keep the heat down, but also help keep temps and humidity consistent.  Would keep lights 24"" away from seedlings and young clones (first couple weeks) then drop it to 18"" if temps aren't a problem.  The issue here is the huge variety in plant size.  You could put the smaller plants on boxes/crates to help make up some of the difference, but you would probably also benefit from having more lights so they could run at different heights.  This way you can lower your lights for autos or stubby indicas, or raise them for monster sativas.  That sounds much more like training, specifically low stress training, than supercropping.  If you're just training the branches down, and not cutting anything, there is no ""cropping"" involved.  Definitely a good idea to train your plants though; they all seem quite tall and thin.  I would start earlier with LST training, tying the plants down or adding clothes pins to the branches, and maybe try topping or FIMing to get even more bulk."

One fan draws the air in from outside through a dryer vent and the other inline fan pulls the air through back out of the tent.  It's a pretty shitty airflow system, but I'm managing so far. I don't make much money so I had to build as I went along.  I have a really powerful exhaust and carbon fiber scrubber that I haven't installed yet primarily because the thing is fucking huge and there was no way of installing it especially since I was already tying them down. The exhaust I have is: VenTech VT IF6+CF6-B Inline Exhaust Blower Fan with Carbon Filter and Variable Speed Controller, 440 CFM, 6""  Basically the exhaust looks like an exhaust stack for a tractor trailer.

It's my experience that fresh leaf is FAR superior to dry in that you get almost zero leaf matter in your mix.   Additionally, can I interest you in attempting what we call the 'dode rinse' (dode aka colas). We found it was amazingly helpful for us since we were having some spidermite issues and if we didn't take care of them the drying buds would be attacked to the point of uselessness. So we'd take a huge stem / branch / plant and dunk it quite unceremoniously into a 5g bucket of cold water. Not only does this clean it of any dust and grime, but it keeps it pert while we trim. We'd actually trim it into manageable size so we could just grab from the bucket. Wet buds = easy trimming = less scissor / finger hash = clean kif = clean buds."

I don't have experience in organics so that is a question better left for someone else.  A better way of detecting a problem with your current methods is to look at your crop as a whole while keeping an eye out for strain specific issues.

microgrowery,3ds4zm,growingkind,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:25 2015 UTC,"Definitely wont cause the curling (tacoing) you got going on , was saying for the brown spots. The leaves, I'd say is heat related. Where's your thermometer at? Put it directly under or near your canapoy and see what it climbs too. 72 is damn near perfect temp though.

What could have caused this?  The last two images are just me wondering what parts I should take away in order to top/fim it. I'm new to growing and don't know much about LST so any pointers would be good.   I know image quality isn't great and they're very close up.

microgrowery,3drlhl,dylz73,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:00:00 2015 UTC,Those holes look like they are from pests. Check the under side of your leaves for caterpillars. Curling looks like heat or light stress. Try raising your lights a bit.

microgrowery,3dqp6w,mrcomic,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:38:31 2015 UTC,It seems to only be on the top. And strangely it seems to be only on the side where my intake fan to my space bucket is.   I put one of my girlfriends succulent in the bucket for a quick minute to try to perk it up before we planted it in a terrarium. But when we transplanted it I don't remember seeing any of these green balls in its soil and it had a tiny little pot the size of my thumb and there are a bunch of these balls.   So now I'm even more confused since you say you've never seen before. Wtf are these things....

microgrowery,3drf1u,whetchup,3,Sat Jul 18 19:00:23 2015 UTC,"To answer your question, yes, the buds should be a similar size if topped/trained so that the tops will be near equal distance from the source light. I however am not a fan of topping or any procedure that causes harm or distress to the plants. But I do train my girls. Starting around 4 or 5 weeks into veg I'll start tying down the main stalk so that it is lower than the remaining tops. As time goes by I will tie down other branches if needed so that all of the main tops are at equal distance from  the light. This time around I am trying something new. Tilt training, at 4 or 5 weeks into veg. I will tilt the plants, soft pots and all at a 45 deg. angle thus allowing maximum light to the head stalk and most of the remaining stalks. When I water/feed I will adjust the pots to the conventional configuration, water, and then return them to tilt mode. The plants seem to be ok with this method and I see no adverse effects. My setup is soil, 3.5 gals., FFOF, House and Garden Ferts, 1000 watts HPS, in a 4' x 4' tent. I typically pull 3 to 4 ozs per plant. Good luck!!"
microgrowery,3drf1u,sugarpantz,2,Sat Jul 18 21:11:41 2015 UTC,I see no notable slowdown in growth when I top. I did 5 rounds of topping and by day 60V it had over 20 well established tops level with eachother. It was 2' tall and 3.5' wide. Recently switched to flower.
microgrowery,3drf1u,Cannabrew,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:14:24 2015 UTC,I agree that topping doesn't really slow growth. I recently topped a two week old and it recovered within about three days. These plants can take a lot of abuse in veg.

If you could somehow get a good mother plant and keep said plant in veg (or maybe a few) and just take starters for your outdoor garden. This way you know for sure that you have females, less time wasted. It's also much easier starting from clone then seed (from my experience), less work as well.  I've never grown outdoors but from the looks of the latest album you posted, a few things stand out: pots look rather small, seems as if your plant isn't getting enough light and is therefore stretching   What kind of nutrients are you using? Growth looks very minimal, it could just be due to stretch issues. I'd recommend keeping it in relatively direct sunlight, keep her well watered and make sure your checking the ph of your water and nutrient solutions before you apply them to your medium.

The method that has worked best for me is to harvest the stems to above the bottom one or two buds, then put them back under 24/0 until what time as you start seeing new growth (Maybe three weeks, but probably sooner.)  When you start getting new growth go ahead and fall back to whatever your preferred veg cycle is.

It's easier to trust an expert grower/author than to believe all of the stoner growing lore that is not based on sound botany and standard successful gardening practices.   For instance, only pot growers flush away soil nutrients at the time when they need the fertilizers the most. In all my years of gardening, I'd never come across this practice used with any other flowering plant or vegetable at the end of fruit production.   Most people here have bought into this. It's certainly never been beneficial to me. But not you've got they fake conflicting info. At least a good book doesn't contradict itself.   Happy growing."

To me it looks like a slew of deficiencies, most likely from ph lockout; given the different pics I have seen I would start flushing with 5.8-6.2 test your runoff and see if it's wacky if it's 4.5 flush with clean water until you get the runoff to 5.8-6.2 then water with a light nutrient solution at the ph. You should see a difference overnight if that's the problem. You can also test this the next time you water. Just check your runoff.

Not sure if I'm familiar with that type of training but I will definitely look up a guide for it.  Seeds for me, in general, are tough to get from sprouting to something decently rooted. I've had more success with the seed starting mixes, but even then you really have to baby them. I'd say I probably lost at least 10 decent sized little seedlings, although I don't know how much of it was my fault and how much of it was just the heat baking them. Got a good little hoard of these seeds now though so I can afford to experiment. Would gladly share a few with you.

Currently on day 27V of my first grow, details of my setup here:  http://tinyplantas.tumblr.com/about  Grow diary here: http://tinyplantas.tumblr.com  I have been having some small issues with what seems to be light intensity due to my mars hydro reflector 144x5 being too close to the plants. When I started the seedlings I had the light at about 24"", but when I transplanted into 3gal smart pots a couple weeks ago they moved closer to ~20"" and started to show signs of what I thought was heat stress, but temps have been between 72-80 consistently. Recently I noticed that the top leaves were canoeing a bit and some of the larger fan leaves are rippling and slightly limp - as in the imgur link in the title.   My question: what is the ideal distance to put these lights from my plants during veg vs flower? Does anyone have experience with this particular light (mars hydro reflector 144x5 new model with the 5w chip), and if so how tall should I let my plants get before flipping in my 2x4x5ft tall tent? I'm concerned that I will need to keep the light at least 18"" away from the top colas during flower, which limits my vertical space considerably, especially since the smart pots raise the plants about 8"" off the floor.  Thanks as always for any guidance, I love this sub - so many friendly and knowledgeable growers.  edit: I emailed mars hydro about this yesterday and just heard back from them, their advice:   It's still the same height for the 144x5w, you can hang it at 18-24 inches at veg and 12-18 inches at flowering.

microgrowery,3dox79,Chemie93,-4,Sat Jul 18 04:49:00 2015 UTC,you need to flush a lot more. This is telling you excess nutes locked in the soil are lowering the output water pH to 5.5. You are nutrient locked hard and burnt causing these leaves. You flush a lot so that your run off MATCHES the input of correctly pH'd water. Upon establishing this one can feed then or allow to dry and continue normal feeding schedules

Expecting to keep it running perfectly for 12/12 light cycle without ever screwing up or running our of gas is unreasonable.   I cannot imagine anything more difficult than laying on the ground reaching down into a refrigerator to tend plants.
microgrowery,3dpfeu,Justforpot,2,Sat Jul 18 08:07:38 2015 UTC,"Alright, here's the problem: Refrigerators are made to be pretty damn close to air-tight, your plants would suffocate from oxygen overdose in no time.    So maybe you drill a hole in it to let some CO2 in?  Well now there's a bright ass spot in the middle of the forest floor, practically a homing beacon to your grow.    If you lay the refrigerator on it's back you run the risk of it being so short that you get your leaves tangled with your lights.    I appreciate your idea and it's ingenuity, but I don't think that a refrigerator is the best the best vessel to try your idea in.    If you're going to go to all that work, why not just plant your seed somewhere out of the way, out in the wild?  Do a stealth forest grow with the realization that it's inherently insecure.

There's only one chair where sitting in means that cops can pretty much do whatever they want to you, and that chair is the driver seat of any automobile.   As a chronic pain patient, I'm vaping all day long. When I arrive at a shopping center parking lot, I exit the vehicle, drop my car keys on the ground and sit in the passenger seat before vaping.

microgrowery,3dozod,weightedimpact,2,Sat Jul 18 01:54:55 2015 UTC,"I pull intake air from an attic, as well. I can tell you that the air temp in the attic is ~120°F. This is what I do. I pull passive intake air into the room, that has an a.c. unit. Then I have the tent setup with open bottom vents>filter>flex>light>flex to fan outside of tent>back out of room. It works pretty well, for my situation. If it's an option, It would probably be easier to pull air from a conditioned space."
microgrowery,3dozod,Dcwburns,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:35:21 2015 UTC,Heat rises. 100F intake air will make your room 100F without an air conditioner connected. Its best to intake from basement (cool air) and output to basement (no heat for helicopters to spot.)  Even in-taking from the basement and outputting to your attic is a better choice.
microgrowery,3dozod,NecroticFury,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:59:37 2015 UTC,I must have described what I'm trying to do wrong. I'm not pulling air into my tent from the attic..... I'm pulling air through my reflectors to cool the lights. The hot air from the attic doesn't ever actually come into the growing environment.... just through the air cooled hoods to remove the hot air produced by the 600w hps bulbs. I'll have a seperate fan that will hook into a carbon filter inside the tent and suck air through the filter and out the top of the tent and into attic. Through passive intake the air in the bedroom will get pulled in through the bottom flaps of the tent.  What I'm worried about is the air cooled hoods getting hot and raising my temps in my tent. If the lights can't cool down since the air blowing through them is 130F then it may cause problems.   Does anybody run a setup similar to this?  Edit:  Also... I do have an air conditioner connected. I agree with you that intake from basement would be best for cooler air but I don't have a basement. Thats why I have an air conditioner in the bedroom that the tent is in. I cool the room down to the temp I want and then just passive intake for tents. I exhaust (output) into the attic because thats the best place in my opinion to exhaust hot air. Heat rises so the higher you exhaust the better. If you exhaust into the basement then you will essentially be heating your basement. (which would be beneficial in winter) I'm in a legal state so no reason for me to worry about the dreaded helicopters.
microgrowery,3dozod,NecroticFury,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:14:26 2015 UTC,"yea well here is what happens, unless he attic has two separate rooms, cool air comes from attic through lights, cools lights. warm air (both from lights and tent) go back into attic. Within a few hours the entire attic is filled with hot air, and suddenly your room is hitting ridiculously high temps. Hot air goes through lights, heats up lights, heats up room. Once your attic is filled (without good ventilation in attic) its a vicious cycle. Consider connecting the intake for the lights through the air conditioner, or putting an air conditioner in the attic. Because basements are below ground level, output air to the basement won't have that bad of an effect.  Run your lights only during the night and allow some ventilation in the attic and you should be fine."
microgrowery,3dozod,NecroticFury,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:51:28 2015 UTC,Okay... I get what you're saying. That was my concern exactly was the hot air heating up the lights/hoods and raising my temps.   What I'll end up doing is pulling air from the bedroom to cool my lights during the summer months. I was hoping to not have to do that because what ends up happening is my air conditioner unit that is in my room has to work harder to keep it cool because the two fans are sucking air out of the room and dumping into attic.   Do you have any suggestions on controllers to use for the fans?
microgrowery,3dozod,Angryh0b0,2,Sat Jul 18 20:51:11 2015 UTC,"I run all my fans at full speed or not at all. Speed controllers are known to cause inline fan malfunctions over the long term. Try your setup now and see how it works, no point in worrying if you didn't even try first. If it is absolutely too hot then put the extra conditioner in the attic and that should cool the air going back into your tent."

microgrowery,3dmq8v,JBird99,3,Fri Jul 17 19:30:10 2015 UTC,3 or 4 weeks out try backbuilding (where you snip the very tips of the buds to encourage fattening up).  2 weeks out start flushing with plain water.  1 week out stop watering all together so the plant is that much drier when you chop.

microgrowery,3dorg7,chronikkilljoy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:28:37 2015 UTC,I was thinking more towards indica. The clones are in the same soil I've been using. Heavy on perlite plenty of drainage. The soil is actually pretty dry already.  How does the mother look for 13 days of flower?
microgrowery,3dorg7,chronikkilljoy,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:59:48 2015 UTC,"They look pretty good, don't show any obvious signs why they have slowed down growth wise. Sometimes, in my experiences, there is a period where the plant focuses on hormone changes, to flower, and may stunt growth for a few days. No new sprouts anywhere? Since they are still just flowering, I wouldn't be too concerned. If something is truly wrong, they will let you know soon and you can adjust. They look pretty happy in my opinion so I wouldn't be too worried.  If you are concerned with the discoloration, you can always just trim those leaves off, it won't kill it. If you are on schedule to use nutes on those babies, maybe hit it a lil earlier than normal with like a 1/4 strength or something and see if that clears it up. The ones I planted (this is my first outdoor, I have a bunch of indoor experience) that have similar markings are doing fine now and I didn't do anything to them."

microgrowery,3dnv4w,alwayssadbuttruthful,4,Fri Jul 17 20:10:08 2015 UTC,I would say that the clone was unhealthy when you got it.  There are only 2 leaves on it.

It's only a problem in soil because they fight for nutes and then you have a really really hard time separating them if you need to transplant.

Looks like your gonna be smoking a few bugs.  Honestly if you have never smoked mite poop you havnt smoked much weed.  It has a distinctive...flavor?  Several ways to clean the weed but nothing is 100%.  Best practice is preventitive spraying early in flower.
microgrowery,3dn9mp,6trees1pot,2,Fri Jul 17 17:49:48 2015 UTC,This is our first grow and we did mess up a bit on the preventative. What methods do you know of to clean the weed? Just trying to salvage what I can. Next grow we'll be more proactive about preventing an infestation.
microgrowery,3dn9mp,6trees1pot,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:13:42 2015 UTC,"There are products out there that address this issue.  I cant recommend any because I dont have experience with any.  I've heard that using a simple garden hose with a good spray nozzle to wash the plants after harvest.  For now, you can still use neem up to the day of harvest.  I cant answer as to why others suggest to not use it but its organic and a natural insecticide.  IF you are going to wash the poop off why not kill the bugs first.  Every 3 days for 2 weeks no more no less 15 min before lights out or sunset.  Added bonus to the neem is its also a fungicide to kill that powdery mildew that happens late in flower."

If you grow in an unoccupied space (separate from living space) Combat No Pest Strips will prevent them for the long term.   While the chemical doesn't get absorbed or deposited on the plants, it is not safe to breathe for extended periods of time in living spaces. Packaging says less than four hours a day. Since I only spend about 15 min per day in the grow area, it's a compromise I make.   I don't have a lot of options because I work every day in an organic community garden and it is guaranteed that I bring pests home every day. Don't tell my organic gardening buddies! Ha!

I believe it is just frequecy water, as in it is water that has a certain frequency surged through it to change it's molecular structure into a more aggressive solvent. Be careful not to wet your buds too much or you risk mold/bud rot. I've also heard that the company that makes it doesn't do a great job at sterilizing batches so there's an even higher chance of mold.  Luckily, I haven't gotten a bad batch.

microgrowery,3dn9mp,TA_145836,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:14:56 2015 UTC,That didn't happen in a couple of days. You need to be in there looking at them every day checking for problems or this is going to be your life forever. You need to take that room down today and burn the weed. Bomb the room and then remove and clean everything and bomb the room twice more and then clean everything again...and guess what...you're probably still going to have mites next crop and the crop after. They are all over the area and will be hell to get rid of. The eggs can sit dormant for ages. Next time you need to hit them with oil and mavrik mix a couple of weeks into veg and then one week after you 12/12. I can seal my (empty)growspace so I also shut of the vent system and throw an ozone generator in there for a couple of days to superkill the shit out of everything. If you are desperate to keep the weed...garbage bag it in the room and take it somewhere far away to a non growers place to process it. Everywhere in your place that that weed goes will have mite eggs just waiting to hitch a ride back in.

microgrowery,3difx8,Product_ChildDrGrant,13,Thu Jul 16 15:08:45 2015 UTC,"Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.    This has less to do with technique, or pH, or nutes, and more to do with the zen of gardening.    When we begin something new we have a tendency to seek out best practices.  If you look around this subreddit you'll see a lot of variations on the same question:     What is the best training method? What is the ideal temperature? Which is better organic or synthetic? 24/0 vs 18/6, which will get me the best results?   These are all fine questions to ask, but they ignore the most important aspect of the grow: The Grower himself.    There is a regular poster on /r/Microgrowery who is head over heels for the benefits of super-cropping, but I've never quite gotten the feel for it.  His go-to method is my sure-fire fuck up.  I prefer LST and revegging, but for others that's the path to failure.  If I pursued what I have been told is the ""best"" training method I would have consistently poor results.    First know thyself, then know thy bud.    Make mistakes and make sure to learn from your mistakes.  Experiment and find what works for you.  Don't stress over having the ""perfect grow.""  Your grow won't be perfect.  Your box will get too hot or too cold, your timer will bug out your light schedule, you'll get deficiencies and overdoses, a limb will break when you supercrop; roll with these punches, learn from them, and do better next time.    In my humble opinion experience will prove more helpful than advice, but take the advice too.    From a more practical and less philosophical perspective:     Keep a journal!  My God this is so fuckin' helpful you won't even believe it. Easiest (Not best, just easiest) way to avoid over watering is to wait until your leaves begin to wilt.  I have not noticed any ill effects from this. Learn to make compost tea.  This is one of my favorite tools for healthy plants, a good brew of compost tea can significantly de-stress a plant. Pick a light schedule, stick to that schedule.  Don't fuck with your light schedule. Oscillating fans really do toughen up the limbs. Know that foliar feeding is not foolproof.  Source: I've nearly killed plants with foliar feeding before. If you have trouble cloning your plants try adding Hydrogen Peroxide to your water.  (1-3tsp/gallon) Almost all advice you receive, even mine, is likely to be anecdotal.  Right now there is very little formal research into best practices for growing our favorite plant, so what you tend to get is from casual or recreational growers.  This is quickly changing though. Do your research before buying nutrients.  There's a ton of snake oil out there, a ton of overpriced over-diluted fertilizers, a ton of mystery ingredients.  When in doubt pick the tried and true... except Super Thrive, they've been ripping people off for decades.   Have fun and make sure to keep us up to date on how you're doing!"
microgrowery,3difx8,LcbZzVd3fS,3,Thu Jul 16 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, what's the story behind your opinion of Super Thrive?  I know it's pretty much only the sea kelp in there that's useful, but overall I haven't noticed or heard about any detrimental effects."
microgrowery,3difx8,BucketOfTruthiness,3,Thu Jul 16 22:37:52 2015 UTC,"This video did it for me.  A side-by-side comparison of a half a dozen different species of plant with no discernible difference between the control group and the fertilized group.    In theory SuperThrive is a combination of Vitamin B1 (Thiamine, which while widely used has no evidence of benefit to plants), Kelp/Sea Weed which are loaded with auxins (Plant growth regulating hormones), and the rest is mystery juice.  The thing is that they don't list their ingredients on the label, they don't have any clinical studies, there's no hard and fast evidence that it actually does anything; and that all sounds skeevy to me.    There are tons of anecdotes that ""I used it on my dying english ivy and it sprung back to life!"" or ""We used it when transplanting a tree and the tree didn't die!"" or ""I've been using SuperThrive for ten years and I can tell you my yields are better now than they every were before!""  (Seriously, you remember crop yields from a decade ago?  You don't think maybe your crops are better because you're a better grower?)  But there are no studies, no research, no actual proof.    In my area the smallest available bottle of SuperThrive runs around $8 USD.  There is much more reliable stuff that $8 could be spent on that will net you better results.  Get an extra oscillating fan, pick up some yellow fly traps, grab another pack of CFLs, spend that money on something you know will work.

It's not only possible but obtainable to get incredible plants while trying to control EVERYTHING and I admire the people who do so, but I've found that getting the basics right is far more important than getting the little things right. Because of that, I've landed on a very simple formula that has worked very well for me:  Soil: 80%Fox farms ocean Forrest soil, 20% perlite, 1tbs/gal of garden lime  Nutes: organic bottles nutes (I've had good results with botanicare pure blend line and general organics GO box). Just make sure to get calmag to add to your basic nutes! And blackstrap molasses as a sweetener.  Watering: tap water with chlorine/chloramine removed run through a filter. Alternate between water + 1tbs/gal molasses and feeding.  Ph: I don't even check  The above has gotten me the best results out of any method I've tried. I could've saved hundreds of dollars if I just stuck with this method.  TL;DR - my one 1 piece of advice is don't overcomplicate things if you don't need to."

microgrowery,3difx8,LcbZzVd3fS,5,Fri Jul 17 03:26:56 2015 UTC,"ALWAYS use a hygrometer. Proper temperature and humidity are important to consistent, robust growth while avoiding mold."
microgrowery,3difx8,CUNTstandinople,2,Thu Jul 16 16:07:57 2015 UTC,Ph contol.  IMO water ph contol is compared to the air quality we breath.  If we have poor air we suffer.  Poor ph and weed does the same.
microgrowery,3difx8,6trees1pot,2,Thu Jul 16 15:29:32 2015 UTC,"Playing Devil's advocate here: With organic growing pH is somewhat less important.  In synthetic grows the plant requires that the water be a certain pH to be absorbed into the roots, sort of like how a beverage must be a certain temperature for a person to be able to drink it.  Just like you can't drink a 200° Pepsi your plant can't drink nutrients in 2.0 pH water.    In organic grows the bacteria and fungi act as a buffer, they digest the organic fertilizer then deposit the waste (Nutrients) into the soil, and in some cases directly into the roots.  Since the bacteria are doing the work instead of the plant we don't have to worry too much about the ideal pH range.  In this case it would be akin to a mother drinking the pepsi, then passing it along to her child via breast milk.    This is an imperfect explanation, but it does illustrate a point: Not all techniques and practices are applicable to all grows; what may be necessary for an organic grow could be a luxury in a synthetic grow and catastrophically wrong for a hydroponic grow."
microgrowery,3difx8,CUNTstandinople,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:53 2015 UTC,What kind of water do you use? How do you control the ph?
microgrowery,3difx8,6trees1pot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:29:35 2015 UTC,Regular tap city water.  If i need the water right away I use an aquarium water conditioner that removes the chlorine immediately.  Or if I'm ahead I will fill jugs and let it sit for a couple of days.  I use an oakton ph2 pen for testing and calibrate the meter once per month.  Adjust with ph up or down.
microgrowery,3difx8,CUNTstandinople,2,Thu Jul 16 16:43:42 2015 UTC,So chlorine is bad?  Why not buy bottled water?  I don't think it contains chlorine or fluoride.
microgrowery,3difx8,6trees1pot,2,Thu Jul 16 17:09:39 2015 UTC,Chlorine and chloramines may kill the microflora in the soil that we so desperately try to maintain.  Typically bottled water has some chlorine too to maintain the water quality.  Distilled is free of chlorine but also has the micronutrients  (calcium and mag) removed.  The issue with tap water mostly is with chloramines which cannot be removed by gassing off.  Aquarium water conditioners remove that.
microgrowery,3difx8,CUNTstandinople,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:19:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, so when I water my plant, I should filter the water and test ph first?  Can you recommend a filter?"
microgrowery,3difx8,6trees1pot,4,Thu Jul 16 17:22:07 2015 UTC,Sure.  Filtered water from a tap is fine.  Always check the ph after all additives have been added.  I dont have a preference in filters and dont filter my tap water.

microgrowery,3difx8,BucketOfTruthiness,2,Fri Jul 17 17:35:00 2015 UTC,Reverse osmosis is the ideal filter system.

microgrowery,3difx8,LcbZzVd3fS,2,Thu Jul 16 22:30:07 2015 UTC,"Chlorinated water is bad for organic grows, where we depend on the soil bacteria to buffer our fertilizers, as mentioned below the chlorine will kill the living hell out of soil cultures.    If you're going with a synthetic grow there's significantly less practical impact, very generally speaking synthetic fertilizers tend to kill soil bacteria anyway.    Also note that chlorinated water can be beneficial for cloning!  Since bacteria can't grow in the water your cuttings are at less risk for a bacterial or fungal infection."
microgrowery,3difx8,CUNTstandinople,2,Thu Jul 16 20:09:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info.  Is it better to go organic rather than synthetic ?
microgrowery,3difx8,LcbZzVd3fS,2,Thu Jul 16 20:18:14 2015 UTC,"Short answer: No.    Longer answer: It depends on the competence of the grower.  Organic growing offers significantly more room for error than synthetic growing does, but that's at the cost of potentially lower yields.  In synthetic growing overfeeding can kill a plant, with organic growing overfeeding is far less risky since you've got the bacterial buffer in place.    I have killed otherwise healthy plants by overfeeding with synthetic fertilizer, I don't have the skill set necessary for a synthetic grow.  Going organic allows me to be sloppy safely.    Now the downside is that organic isn't as efficient as a synthetic grow because of the bacterial buffer.  You're not just feeding the plant; you're feeding the soil.  Synthetic fertilizers are comparable to force feeding, and as such you can (theoretically) feed a plant to it's maximum capacity.  A ""perfect"" organic grow will produce less than a ""perfect"" synthetic grow.    You're going to need to learn your own strengths and weaknesses as a grower to find out which method is right for you.  Experiment, try both, mix and match!    Oh, one more thing: Organic fertilizers smell fanfuckintastic.  No joke!"

Get some more insight before you decide either way, as both methods have their merits.    If you're the type who always had his homework in on time a synthetic grow might be better for you.  If you can keep your room clean a synthetic grow might be better for you.  If you keep a journal with regular updates a synthetic grow might be better for you.  I have absolutely none of those qualifications.  :P    Experiment, learn, screw up, learn more, then decide for yourself which is the better fit for you.

That the dosages on nutrients is there for a reason, and should never be increased unless you know your plant can take it.

Can't tell you where I read it, just common knowledge really.   If I had a gallon of water at 9, I'd add about 30 drops of ph down then measure again. If it's where I want it, great.

microgrowery,3dkxcp,TheReginald,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:02:14 2015 UTC,"Looks more like magnesium than calcium. Calcium starts with tiny brownish spots, whereas magnesium starts with yellow/white spots that grow and then turn brown which is what I'm seeing.   Magnesium deals with photosynthesis so when it's lacking the leaves turn yellow.   Calcium deals with cell strength so when that's lacking the cells just die and turn brown.   Foliar spray with a 2% solution Epsom salt or add epsom salt to your water when feeding.   Epsom salt is Magnesium Sulfate, so you get Magnesium and Sulfur.   pH should be between 6.5-7 for soil in order for it to take it up, I know other people will have other numbers, but from all the charts I've looked at it seems like it can take it up through a pretty wide range.   And to end this by saying I'm not a professional, this is just what I've learned over the many trials and tribulations. Currently dealing with a calcium def. on my end."

microgrowery,3dkxcp,TheReginald,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:37:23 2015 UTC,cal-mag works. I am running aquaponics so I just add calcium carbonate (pH up) plus the calcium that's in my water already. But here's a secret:   Amino Acids! Adding amino acids to your feeding helps the plants take up much more calcium. Instead of 1 ion at a time it allows it to take up thousands. NPK Indusrties products It's called ominA   Harley Smith on plant nutrients take the time to watch this. It's really informative on how plants works.

microgrowery,3dk1i1,Poonsquad420_696969,-1,Fri Jul 17 18:32:41 2015 UTC,They're feminized seeds. You can't stabalize them when you have to literally stress the chromosomes in their genetics. It's not possible as of now to have a 100% guarantee that it will be feminized.
microgrowery,3dk1i1,roythehamster,4,Fri Jul 17 19:14:11 2015 UTC,"i just replied to your other comment but im going to reply to this one too since its different. if you don't want to read this whole thing, read this: the chance of 8 feminized seeds being male is on par with the chances of winning the powerball lottery.   i agree that the line is not fully stable, that is impossible to accomplish. but with extensive inbreeding you can fix alleles in a population, making them very stable for chosen alleles. the difference between smell profiles of jack herer and OG for example.   you say it's not possible to have 100% feminized and i also agree with that. however, when making feminized seeds, you are using female only chromosomes (XX). Male chromosomes are of course XY. Do the punnet square and crossing a male gamete with a female gamete will result in 50% XX female and 50% XY male. Do the punnet square and cross two female XX gametes and you get 100% female. of course these are the theoretical rates, so actual rates will likely be different.   Now we have regular seeds 50% female/50% male and feminized seeds 100% female, theoretically. Let's be very generous and say that feminized seeds produce males 20% of the time and females 80% of the time. At this rate, out of 8 seeds, you should expect around 6-7 seeds to be female and one to be male. For regular seeds, 4 males and 4 females. The OP planted 1? feminized seed and got a male. That could be terrible luck, since the actual rate of females from feminized seeds is well over 90%, probably closer to 99%. Then he linked to someone who planted 8 feminized seeds and got 8 males. The chances of 8 males with regular seeds is (0.5)8 =1/264=0.38%. The chances of 8 males with our generous 80/20 rate is (0.2)8 =1/390,265=0.000026%. The chances of 8 males with feminized seeds at a more realistic rate (lets say 95% female) is (0.05)8 =0.0000000039%.   Something is seriously wrong here."
microgrowery,3dk1i1,Poonsquad420_696969,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"But you have to factor in the THOUSANDS of seeds that come out for commercial sale. 8 isn't that many. It's improbable that one person would get them, but in reality, it's really not many for a company. yes he should be compensated, but op only had one plant be a male. That's not something to make a fuss over."
microgrowery,3dk1i1,roythehamster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"a company should be vigorously testing its product before it goes to market. if it is unstable, they need to do more work. if feminized seeds are producing males something is wrong. if feminized seeds are producing more than half males, something is DEFINITELY wrong. i'm just saying that any company that knowingly -- maybe they didn't know, but if they didn't that isn't very attractive either -- puts an unfinished, sub-par product on the market should be embarassed by that. the first batch should have very similar allele frequencies as the any other batch because the strain is bred using two phenotypes. you continue to use clones of those phenotypes to produce future seeds, otherwise the line will lose stability. i'm not saying breeding is easy, i'm saying that a company with the reputation of barney's farm shouldn't be having high rates of males coming from feminized seeds. that's not a small mistake."

You all are acting like this doesn't happen anywhere else, when yes it does. It's very common. 8/8 is improbable, but not impossible. thats also only one person saying that happened. OP had 1 fem be a male, that's not as uncommon. A batch of commercial seeds will be in the thousands of seeds, it's not that hard to imagine that there would be a handful of males in there. I'm not sure if you understand the feminizing process, but you're chemically stressing the female plant to produce seeds with a higher chance of not having the male chromosome. It's not totally eliminating the male chromosome from the seeds, there's still going to be some that have it. They don't breed out the male chromosome so breeding isn't the problem. It's the genetic stress that they're putting on the plants.  edit: I'm not saying that person who got 8/8 shouldn't be compensated and given free seeds or something, but OP only had one plant of it which that's not something that should be a big deal over 1 seed."

Many growers who have run into this agree that the type of sap produced is sweet and doesn’t contain much (if any) THC. It is mostly made of sugar and water and so is not smokable. Seems to be related to the plant over-producing sugars, and sap productions is more common when:   Plants being in the flowering stage Using sugar supplements like molasses, Botanicare Sweet, Sugar Daddy, etc. Big temperature difference between night and day, especially if it gets cold at night Certain strains or individual plants seem more likely to produce sap Yet sometimes oozing sap seems to happen for no known reason   No need for alarm as far as I am concerned."

Filter-cool tube-ducting-fan-out is how I've got it set up.   I'm glad I went with the hyperfan. I feel the ventech inline would have been too big and really, more than I needed. The hyper is rated at max 315cfm, the ventech I was looking at was 440. But the wattage difference is huge! Hyper is 35-80ish if I remember correctly. I figure I'm pulling about 50 watts with it.   They're more expensive, but I'm glad I went with it. It's small, lightweight, quiet, and blue (doesn't matter but it looks pretty).   For the filter, I went with some cheap filter from Amazon. I thought about the phresh filter, but I settled on a cheap-O. 6x18 I think was the size. It's perfect for my setup. You really can't smell a damn thing in the room. If I had to do it over again, I'd get the same shit I got."
microgrowery,3djthq,youngandstupiddumb,2,Fri Jul 17 18:56:22 2015 UTC,Wow man thanks for the info. I've been reading up on them and they are definitely the next generation of fan design. I desperately need it as I'm running close to 90 constantly. Plan to use this and exhaust into my attic. Prob go with a cheap carbon filter too as I don't think the kind will be as bad and def better than current setup.

Some strains more than others. You could always start and find out for yourself then add the carbon filter later if needed. Most townhouses have a ""Firewall"" between each unit. That may help mask some of it. Those should work fine. Keep in mind those will generate some heat that will need to be displaced."

No i have never smelled my neighbors cooking while in my house, only if I'm outside and they have their windows open. Adding it later if it becomes a problem makes a lot of sense.  Would using the 9 42w bulbs suggested in the beginners setup produce less heat than the ones i selected?"
microgrowery,3dk3dd,FailCollins,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:54:11 2015 UTC,"They will all produce some heat but not nearly as much as HID lighting. I would still go with the bulbs you first suggested the 105w. You will need some way of removing the heat from the tent. A smaller 240cfm INLINE FAN  or a booster fan should do the trick.  I have a 1000w HPS in my 4'x4'x7' flower tent with a 400cfm inline fan with a CONTROLLER and I usually have it on half speed.  They do also have kits including carbon filter you can get.. THIS one would be perfect for you. 190cfm should do the trick and your tent has 6"" and 4"" inch ports.   Of course if you got the coin you can always go with the LEDs mentioned by others here. Fair warning.. This hobby is addicting and you will want to upgrade in the near future. :D"

Yes, the carbon filter and fan will be your only source of heat displacement.   Edit:  I see you are doing the same tent size as me as well, that light will be really great and with 2 plants you can plan on about 2 ounces or so every 3-4 months.

microgrowery,3dj1tt,DoeDoe33,4,Thu Jul 16 17:49:50 2015 UTC,"Even if you don't add nutrients, leaves take CO2 from air, hydrogen from water and use energy from the light to make atp to power cells and sugars to build cell structures. Once leaves have grown, they are net energy contributors to the plant. There is a leaf at the base of every bud, if that leaf is removed that bud will be deprived of a local energy source. If a leaf is going to be removed it is better to do it before the plant invests resources in making a big fan leaf.  I don't check ph, I don't do run off, I reuse coco, I water heavily, erratically, basic nutrient schedule, ignore humidity levels, flush once for salt between grows, just grew a pound of perfect hybrid in 1.2m sq tent. could easily have had more with a longer veg and flower time, so my advice is the simplest of all  don't cut except to top  long veg  long flower = loads of weed.

microgrowery,3dj1tt,thatswinkydude,2,Sat Jul 18 13:56:51 2015 UTC,"Yes, combined water/feed every four or five days, I water heavily if I have to go away even leaving water in the tray does not phase the plant at all, lightly if I can monitor dryness (lighter watering leads to much less evaporation, saturated soil is pointless imo), molasses instead of canna boost because it is so expensive, I have a pretty full tent no light gets to the floor when they are mature, Gavita 600w, 12 litre buckets. Maybe I am just lucky with water ph etc. I so don't miss doing run off, what a hassle that was with ten plants, and by my observations so far serves no purpose whatsoever. Flushing I also question - if you lay off nutrients for ten days before chop the plant has loads of time to metabolise whatever is in the soil, you just have to look at how quickly a plant recovers from excess nutes to see how quickly this process happens.  We don't hear enough about revegging. I am shocked to discover that weed is pretty much a perennial, not an annual, and can just be regrown utilising the fully mature root and branch system ie they grow like fuck with thick woody stems and multiple nodes. Two are full reveg on my current grow and are going to be unbelievable, twenty colas each."

Two possible problems I saw: it's not in veg anymore so it can't take abuse and I'll kill the plant when I transplant or the plant is already root bound by spending time in a very small container and transplanting is worthless. In the future,  I will not sex my plants in small cups and have to deal with something like this again, because I'll make sure to buy femized seeds.  I didn't know any better and bought normal seeds, which has casued immense amount of space problems for me since 2/3 of the plants I've planted are male.

microgrowery,3dhpw4,sauceLegs,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:53:51 2015 UTC,I dont use mh because I dont have a bulb for it.  I dont really need it.  HPs is suitable for veg and flower whereas MH is for veg only.  If you have both of course switch them.
microgrowery,3dhpw4,6trees1pot,2,Fri Jul 17 20:57:36 2015 UTC,Count the nodes. A cutting needs to be from a node onwards. So you really can't get anything until the mother plant has at least five nodes.

Referencing that Jack Herer should be the exact same from one shop to another shows that. He doesn't understand that selective breeding among different breeders has created many different forms of one strain, each favoring the characteristics that they desire. That's like saying every single Chinese person should have the exact same DNA makeup, physique, personality, etc. Even broader to compare one strain to another. That's like saying an English person is the same as a Chinese person. THC will give you the same high from strain to strain, as well as the many cannabinoids. It's the concentration and varying combinations of them that makes them different and gives you a more or less complex high/effects. I have a mind to send this guy an email and tell him he's ignorant to some pretty basic concepts.

Sure, we are starting to understand the effect of THC and CBD, but what about the other 50+ turpenes in a typical strain? Just because two strains have a similar THC/CBD ratio and percentage might not mean ANYTHING about the medical efficacy of one or the other.    His argument that indicas and sativas are pretty much the same seems rather naive to me, considering my siblings and I are genetically almost identical but we look nothing alike nor do we act similarly (I have a PhD in botany, my sister is a preacher). So just because two strains are genetically almost identical doesn't mean anything.    However, anyone that has grown a few seeds of the same strain will agree that - just like my siblings example above - different plants that are the same strain can be VERY different phenos. I think the cannabis industry would be doing itself a favor if it only allowed naming to pass from a mother plant to her clones."

There are tons of examples of this in biology so its not a huge surprise.   To be clear he is not saying all highs are the same, but rather that buying a sativa or indica specifically isn't going to give you a consistent desirable high unless you are growing a cloned plant that you're smoking consistently."

Of course different strains have different effects. They are all packed full of different cannabanoids and terpenes and varying thc and cbd levels.   It's not like cannabis hasn't been broken down and studied extensively at the molecular level many times. It has.   Fuck sativa and indica are two completely different species.

microgrowery,3dhamt,Lord_Kossity,9,Thu Jul 16 07:10:24 2015 UTC,"Woof, this topic makes me nervous.  How old is your home?  How old is the panel/wiring?  What size service is entering the home, and how much is available for this grow? Breakers or fuses? Are the outlets already grounded (three prong)?  Does the house have two legs of service to run ""high"" voltage (208-240v) equipment?  Also consider you will need some large exhaust fans, possibly air conditioners, heaters or de/humidifiers, which all draw a ton of juice and ""surge"" when their motors/compressors turn on and off.  There are so many factors here, you really need to get someone in who knows what they're doing, and do it right.  You should calculate the load for all of the things you need to run, and then talk to an licensed electrician, or at least a grower in your area who knows enough to not burn your house down."
microgrowery,3dhamt,fanarc,5,Thu Jul 16 13:09:37 2015 UTC,"Electrician here.  Unless you decide to get a solar array or something similar backup batteries aren't really going to be a great option. A backup generator is really common though especially in rural areas. Plus with the generator you can have them set up to the mains power of the house so you don't even have to do anything to set it up. Batteries are also typically fiercely expensive.  Powering lights and fans etc with a generator is no problem but if you have to do any aircon/heating/water pumping that uses way more amps than most typical appliances. Make sure that when you get the generator you seriously consider everything in the house and go find the label with it's ratings on it. Hot Water is a big one but if you aren't going to be living there turn the hot water mains off.   tldr; get your shopping list of grow gear, do the math on it's power draw, get a generator that covers that and then some. Maybe consider buying a diesel storage tank. Get the fuel on bulk sale price."
microgrowery,3dhamt,Neipsy,4,Thu Jul 16 11:58:20 2015 UTC,"I definitely second doing your research, buying a generator larger than you feel you need, and considering diesel if this is going to be used frequently.  If you intend on installing a cut-off or transfer switch to attempt to connect a generator directly to your house or service, please contact an electrician!  You can easily back-feed the mains to the generator (or vice versa) or be supplying something with both shore and generator power and overload it (or kill yourself).  Battery backups are hugely cost prohibitive, and would realistically only be big enough to run a single fan or a light for MAYBE an hour or so before dying.  Getting one large enough to run your rig would cost an arm and a leg, and take of serious space."

Definitely this for sure. This is the difference between home DIY jobs and requiring some training. edit: while the electrician is there get him to check out the rest of the house. Getting an electrician out rural is usually expensive and infrequent. Worth using his time while he's there. It won't be suspicious at all to him. A half decent grow op is less shoddy then some farming rigs I've seen before.    Battery backups are hugely cost prohibitive   This is true as well. It's the biggest reason all our renewable sources aren't as efficient as they could be. Solar technology far outweighs battery tech nowadays."
microgrowery,3dhamt,Neipsy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:33:38 2015 UTC,"Licensed electrician, solar engineer..  A few things, first off you want a natural gas generator that way it can run as long as necessary. You will also need an upgraded electrical service with a critical loads panel (grow circuits, hvac) with a proper ATS (automatic transfer switch). Although there are many good battery options, I don't think it is needed in your situation.. you could use a device like the Sunny Island and connect the generator and home electrical to it, this acts as a charge control, ac/dc and dc/ac inverter with a connected battery bank. Your proposed setup is going to require a proper electrician and potentially some engineering.. don't half ass something like this."

Solar is an attractive option and now that the tesla backup battery will be here soon that would be an awesome setup. Other than that get a good size generator but don't expect to run your lights reliably off of it. This should be used as an emergency measure to keep one light at most running until service is restored. One thing I should note is the laws in your area. Make sure you know the penalty before doing this. It seems you just had a windfall, better to not make that windfall your local law enforcements because you decided to grow some plants."

If I can have some specific answers to what I may need to ask (will my electrical system support it), what brands of battery backup\ups and what not should I look into? Sorry if I sound dumb but even differentiating AC\DC seems complicated to me."
microgrowery,3dhamt,Justforpot,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:22:20 2015 UTC,Hmm. Well your electrical service to your house if you are on a grid should be reliable. 5 600 true watt panels will draw 3000 watts or 3kw. This is AC or alternating current. DC isn't used so you don't need to worry about that. Budget another 1kw for everything else related to your grow so your looking at needing 4 kW of reliable power which should be no problem for your utility. A good generator will put out like 20kw and run into the thousands so this would work fine to cover an outage from your utility. Getting a standby generator won't be suspicious given that you live in a rural area. Make sure you have plenty of fuel to feed it as well. These generators will hook up to your electrical service and may need to be turned on in an event of a power outage but it should power your whole house if you lose power with your grow op consuming about a quarter of the output. Yes your house should be able to handle this without any problems. What I would recommend is to shop for one and talk to the store about being concerned about not having power. They won't think anything of it. You are going to need a qualified electrician to go to your house and make sure everything is right but no one will think anything of you getting one. I'm sure most people in rural areas would have one of they could.

Something that if i have to be away from there for a couple days I could be fine with just leaving as is? I mean I would like to be able to tend to my own thing and visit every 2-3 days. So if it goes out not to have to worry about it if it gets snowed in or just a drag to drive up.

microgrowery,3dhamt,X0dium,0,Thu Jul 16 07:56:09 2015 UTC,"How much do you plan to grow? The general rule of thumb is do not use more than 1000 watts per bedroom in the house or it will look suspicious. This makes it look more like your typical family. For places with unreliable power outages just run your vegging plants on 24/0. That way, if there is a power outage, the power will likely come on before you fall below 18 hours of light. Flowering it does not matter if plants only get 5 or 6 hours of light one day, they will still be in flower."
microgrowery,3dhamt,JBird99,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:11:00 2015 UTC,"I find this hard to believe. There are a ton of appliances, computers, tvs, etc. That can take up 1000 watts easily. Is it really that low? At 120v on a 15 amp breaker you can push more than 1000 watts. So I don't see how that's correct?"
microgrowery,3dhamt,X0dium,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:31:02 2015 UTC,"The comment was not saying that is the limit a breaker can handle, I was saying do not go over this amount to avoid suspicion from police who get tipped off from power companies.

microgrowery,3dhamt,fanarc,3,Thu Jul 16 16:57:28 2015 UTC,"Yea, I see what you are saying. I just don't see how this small amount of usage would tip off the power companies.

microgrowery,3dhamt,dingodego,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:22:38 2015 UTC,"I'm with you here.  Simply having all appliances (electric water heater, dryer, range, etc) could skew someone's usage by several thousand watts/month.  Also a home with central air/heat will draw a ton more juice.  I grow and probably still have a bill less than half that of my neighbor because we have gas appliances and no A/C.    I guess if one unit in an apartment complex was using 5 times the average it might raise some eyebrows, but only if every unit was identical.  Even then someone could be running servers, large fish-tanks, or growing something legal indoors.  Doesn't make sense to try and just target people based on their power consumption.  Maybe if I used 100+kwh/day AND had a purple glow coming from every window and door 24/7."
microgrowery,3dhamt,GeneralTeeSoo,-1,Thu Jul 16 23:13:41 2015 UTC,You need to inspect how much amperage your home can take. The standard two prong plug can take 15amps with 6 large led's and all the associated electronics you will likely be well over that. If you have  three prong washer and dryer plug you should use that.
microgrowery,3dhamt,fanarc,1 point,Thu Jul 16 07:54:49 2015 UTC,Sounds like something I want to do. How do I check the amperage? I need an electrician? Hydro company?
microgrowery,3dhamt,GeneralTeeSoo,3,Thu Jul 16 08:14:42 2015 UTC,"This is not sound advice, a washer has its own 120v 20a plug and a dryer has a dedicated 240v ~40a plug. To see what your home's main over current protection is just go look at the main breaker in your panel. From there you are interested in the over current protection for the circuits you intend to use for your grow. You will need to do load calcs once you determine your setup then you can see if the existing circuitry in the grow area is sufficient."
microgrowery,3dhamt,fanarc,2,Thu Jul 16 13:18:17 2015 UTC,"Everything you buy should have a UL/CTL or other underwriter's sticker on it that certifies it is electrically safe and typically tells your the operating voltage and power consumption of the device.  Take the power consumption figure (in either watts or amps, just use the same unit for everything) for every single device, and add them up.  Don't forget exhaust fans, air conditioning, heating, de/humidifiers, etc.  You can use these numbers to perform some basic load calculations, and see if you have enough service available to run this grow.  Break up your loads onto different circuits (ie breakers or fuses), and never load anything over more than ~75-85%.  If your fuses are rated for 20amps, never put more than ~16 amps on it.  These loads will be continuous (fans or lights on 24 hours a day) and can literally cook the wire in your walls if overloaded.  Extra room on your circuit means you can go into the room, and plug your cell charger into any wall not worrying about blowing a breaker.  Also, things with motors and compressors (ac, dehumidifiers, etc) can cause a surge or extra load when they start up.  Never change the size of a breaker or fuse without talking to an electrician!  Avoid running extension cords, especially anything over 25'.  Try to buy larger gauge extensions cords (ie 10/3 or 12/3) to run anything that draws a higher load.

microgrowery,3dh2jb,GOASTT,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:35:30 2015 UTC,Are you sure you mean calyxes and pistols because those are parts that shouldn't show up until flowering.  You might actually be looking at stiplules which grow out of each node.  Its ok if these die off because they aren't important but if the leaves and growth point next to them dies off then that is something to worry about.  Pictures would help.
microgrowery,3dh2jb,Tree_Eyed_Crow,0,Thu Jul 16 06:32:30 2015 UTC,"Will get home from work in about 3-4 hrs so ill post pics then, the reason i thoughts they were calyxes and not stipules is because they had hairs coming out (assumed they were pistils). I would love for them to be flowering but i didnt think flowering would start till at least early august. I am in the northeast US and have been concerned with how much flower time ill get before i chop cause first frost usually hits by 3rd week of sept or so."

microgrowery,3ddxzw,Chemie93,7,Wed Jul 15 16:39:03 2015 UTC,Just press them between the pages of a book. Leave for at least a week. It'll be pretty fragile when all done.
microgrowery,3ddxzw,Palindromer101,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"oh thanks! So, the idea is just to hold them steady as they dry into the position they're in? Like hanging roses upside down as they wilt? EDIT: Big books  > small books?"

microgrowery,3ddxzw,EnterestedGF,-2,Wed Jul 15 21:12:35 2015 UTC,"I think the best way would be to lay the leaves face down on the glass of a picture frame, and then lay a stack of A4 copier paper on top for like a month, then simply attach the glass to the frame.

microgrowery,3ddxzw,BabyFaceMagoo2,3,Wed Jul 15 20:05:38 2015 UTC,"That's not the best way to press leaves at all. You put them between paper so that the moisture lost doesn't stay on the leaf and cause issues while it dries.

microgrowery,3ddxzw,EnterestedGF,-1,Wed Jul 15 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"it would not ruin it, no. not sure what issues you refer to but in this case the resin and moisture would help the leaf stick to the glass without glue or support."

microgrowery,3dghjr,ConvertsToMetric,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:50:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Not intentional to not rotate them...just my first grow and I was actually stressing about LSTing them at all. Once I saw how christmas tree they got, and how few branches I'd have, I threw some bamboo sticks in there and tied the tops down. Canopy came out pretty nice, but will definitely continue to modify my LST and other techniques as I grow more.   Was planning on lollipopping. The guys at the plant shop said the latest I should do it was three weeks into flower. Any thoughts? was thinking this weekend  They were in veg about 11 weeks...didn't mark down exact date. Another thing to correct next grow : )  Thanks again!"
microgrowery,3dghjr,Cannabrew,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:19:36 2015 UTC,Now is a perfect time to lollipop. Using a combination of multiple toppings (starting very early on) and LST is nice because you can make the canopy very wide and flat to utilize the light most efficiently. Start with topping after the second node develops (around 2 weeks in). I topped as many tops as I could until a couple weeks before switching to 12/12. LST just the branches rather than the stalk itself. Over a couple adjustments pull the branches down to horizontal. The branches can bend a decent amount without breaking as long as you do it slowly. Keep moving the tie-downs farther out on the branch as they grow to widen the plant. Here are my girls. Strawberry sour diesel and shoreline 60V. Edit: links
microgrowery,3dghjr,KoreEnt,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:45:21 2015 UTC,Nice. Gonna lollipop tomorrow and transplant an ak 48 into a 3 gallon tomorrow. Always something to do with the plants!

I can try to break it down in a bit more info.  -Started from seed (feminized) -Early life up untill now has been smooth sailing - started at 1/4 stength nutes and worked my way up using basic nutes. Using dutch nutrient formula (DNF) 2 part veg solution A & B mix together and ph to certain level    ph has always been in and aroun 6.0 to 6.3...so some sort of fluxuation but nothing to major   The black dots started off small from the get go but it was on normal green leaves. The effected leaves are now turning yellow with increasingly bigger black specs. Stared from bottom and worked its way up to mid way of plant.  Tried my best to inspect for mites or any other bug with a basic magnifying glass. Didnt see anything but I ran across the odd spider and an earwig crawling around.    If it is a bacterial / fungi issue am I able to just remove the infected parts of the plant and hope it doesnt re- appear?

microgrowery,3dgml7,Newfff,4,Thu Jul 16 02:56:01 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, bovedas are better at giving moisture back rather than taking it. I burped my jars down to ~60% RH the normal way, without the packs. Once I reached 60% I put 1 pack in each of my quart sized mason jars and sealed them. They sit right at 62%-64% even a year after i sealed them. It's more so to help keep bud stable for long term storage rather than taking any of the work out of curing.    TLDR: you still need to cure the old fashioned way so you evaporate moisture, use the packs for long term storage."

microgrowery,3depcp,lrn2grow,3,Wed Jul 15 18:10:56 2015 UTC,Honestly the bottom of the plant is the least of your concern. Its the oldest and becomes the most shaded. Nitrogen and other nutes can be mobile or immobile. When a plant cannibalizes a lower fan leaf quickly its moving at least one mobile nutrient out such as nitrogen.   The plant is hungry but unless you're getting lots of lower fan leaves turned to crisp over night I wouldn't worry too much.    The tops look great.  Keep it up.
microgrowery,3depcp,mindcrimez,2,Thu Jul 16 02:57:00 2015 UTC,"I think it could be a bit of nute lock out caused by a lack of micro nutes, get some cal/mag to add with the feed. This late you won't see much of a difference, but next grow you should. Leaves yellowing later in flowering is normal, but heavy yellowing is usually during flushing. If lower fan leaves start yellowing and then dying during the first few weeks of flower, progressing higher up into 3-7 weeks, the plant is most likely eating stored nutrients in them to produce flowers, As many different nutrients are needed for a healthy, high yielding plant."
microgrowery,3depcp,Trollbard,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"The term ""nute lockout"" refers to a pH out of range for a particular or multiple nutrients be it macro or micro.   He could be lacking a micro nutrient but there's no way to tell from these shots. Suggesting cal/mag with this data seems misguided."
microgrowery,3depcp,mindcrimez,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:03:11 2015 UTC,"Unless you are growing purely organically(Where you will have a natural source of cal/mag) you need cal/mag if you want any sort of yield, you obviously grow small yielding bonsai's under insufficient light.  Because a person says they are checking ph does not mean they are checking it properly, he could be sticking a ph dip stick into the top inch of soil, that will tell nothing about the ph around the root-ball, especially the main nutrient uptake area.  When a plant is flowering heavily and uses all the available cal/mag and other micro nutes stored in leaves etc when it is not getting them through feed, which are needed for the plant to use p/k efficiently, it becomes deficient via nute lock out, regardless of obvious ph variance.  From the info he gave, the shots and experience of seeing similar things in my learning curve, this was the best I could come up with, if you can provide another theory with any sort of relevance, then please do."
microgrowery,3depcp,Trollbard,1 point,Thu Jul 16 08:47:22 2015 UTC,"Im sorry thought I replied to the OP as well as you.  Considering the photos given and the info provided they look like healthy flowering plants.    Plants will cannibalize old and ineffective fan leaves, is the lower ones.  Nutrient lockout will be present at the top of the plant as well.  This is typical of flowering, especially indoors.   If people chased every yellow leaf we'd have a lot more sick plants in here. And IMO most sick plants posted in here are usually overwatered.   Chasing pH, TDs/ppm, and moisture usually leads to more issues than there was and often the best response is leave it alone."

microgrowery,3deng0,Fizzy_T,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:15:07 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Read up on how to use it. You want to spray until there is runoff. Make sure to get the bottom of the leaves as well because that's where mites live. Also make sure to spray multiple times. If you only spray once they may come back stronger.

(I can't remember the site to be honest, I had tried a few different ones around that time.)  Grown in organic soil under a 2"" T5 fluorescent on a 20/4 cycle. Nothing special, honestly.    Once it germinated, within 10 days it already had pistils forming on the nodes.  I let it grow a couple tight nodes and topped it.  Within 2 days I noticed that the plant wasn't splitting the way it should and buds had started to form.    I did some research and it turns out I had been given an auto-flowering seed mistakenly and didn't know it.  I think, by topping it I stunted its growth completely as those tops turned to buds. (If someone knows if my theory is correct, please let me know.  I'm genuinely curious myself!)   After I noticed it wasn't getting any more height to it I just kept the lights nice and tight and let her cook at 350° for 25-30 minutes until golden brown.  Here were are 46 days later!"

The best place to make this cut is just below the last fully developed node. This will make the plant more bushy in appearance and allow the light to penetrate deeper into the plant, in turn developing more quality buds and a larger yield.  I don't grow so I can't vouch for the accuracy."

microgrowery,3ddvbg,Pineapple_8ob,2,Wed Jul 15 15:38:57 2015 UTC,"My recommendation would be to start small. My first set up was 2x 96w 2' 4 bulb T5 in a 2'x4'x6.5' tent. I learned the basics with that set up, how they grew, what they needed, ect... When I felt like I out grew that set up I got a 4x4 tent and 1000w hood off of Craigslist (for a really good deal) and my original tent became my veg tent. Start off with just one or two of the Mars hydro lights (or whatever lights you end up choosing) and grow a plant or two under them. See the spread of the light, get first hand experience as to weather the light will cover the area you are working with at the height you want to hang them. With some careful planning you can build your dream indoor garden a few pieces at a time, spreading out the coast of setting up an indoor garden and giving you time to figure out how you like to run your garden. I guess what I'm trying to say is it's really hard to give you specifics because there are so many variables. For example if you are planing to run 8 plants and want to harvest one a week and replace it with a new one, you will have to pick a plant that finishes its flower in 8 weeks.

Obviously that isn't ideal, you want to give them the best start possible but it also really isn't a disaster.  I didn't feed them I didn't do anything other than let the roots bust through the shitty soil I gave them.   When you are potting up you want to wait until you see the roots just starting to poke out the container then you can pop them in to a bigger pot.   But again - it isn't a disaster if you don't do that  Either way I fully expect those seedlings to hit a growth spurt soon.   Come back in 7-10 days and update us - I bet they'll be bigger ;)"

Coco specific nutes contain higher amounts of these two elements since coco binds them up. Too much calcium can definitely cause an issue. Just keep an eye out for lockout.

Pretty obvious now looking back but man its truly a big difference IMO. That said the potency is there, taste is there and smell is fucking jaw dropping with nebula. Also what really helps is get a flat(tray) then a big humidity for $5 at grow store makes world of a difference instead of trying to cram them into a little one from big box store. I've been using rapid rooters really like them. One thing very important use alcohol in between plants to insure your not cross contaminating. Mist once a day, open the lid twice a day for fresh air that's all there is too it. Just make sure to label and insure you have good roots before you flower the mother's so you don't lose the strain.

microgrowery,3dacd4,mindcrimez,3,Tue Jul 14 19:01:50 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call it finished or my last but it seems to do the job.    I was lucky enough to find the 5 gal bottle without a handle for 3 bucks at goodwill.  Im using the smallest model of the ecoplus commercial air pumps. Uses about 30watts.  Including the pump you could build this for 50 bucks or 20ish without.   I originally had an airline running down the tube with and without an airstone.  I then decided to do more of a direct injection with a brass barb siliconed into the button of the up tube.   The amount of flow you can get from an airlift is amazing. I plan to incorporate it into an organic dwc grow.   I guess I'm open to recipes.

But yes, just the air pump connected to a brass barb on the bottom of the tube raises the water up and into the main tank.  It has a 45deg bend at the tip to help the vortex.  Down at the bottom is just a rubber coupler that hose clamps to the water bottle and then hose clamps to the pvc.   I used a T so I could put a tap on it.  Don't use this tap, they clog, get a plastic ball valve or something else creative but definitely find a means of pouring/emptying it out easily.  I'll shot a video of it when it's done and I'll use fresh water so you can see the vortex."

microgrowery,3db77i,gobbler87,5,Tue Jul 14 22:36:09 2015 UTC,"The solution doesn't become bad. We swap it out because the nutrients are depleted at different rates. Sometimes the girl needs more nitrogen than potassium. We refresh the nutrients to renew the levels of NPK to the required levels.  Ideally the PPMs coming out of the reservoir are the same as the PPMs going in. If the PPMs are higher at the end of the week, we lower the amount going back in, because she isn't using all the nutes. She wants more water. But, if the PPMs are lower, we add more nutes next time because she is using them!  The PPMs that are absorbed vary depending on the ""phase"" the plant is in. As do the NPK levels. This is why we dump and flush. We don't know what levels of each of the N and P and K are left.  I run one plant at a time. DWC. I probably dump 20 gallons of 1000 ppm solution down the toilet each run (7 weeks). That is counting the flushes."

Unless you are hydro there isn't a reason to dump nutes. No grower should be letting their nute reservoir go bad to the point where they dump it. That's user error.   The Only thing I've done similar to what you're talking about is cleaning my reservoir. It an extremely weak concentration of nutes and I'll just dump it on my grass.

microgrowery,3d9ovv,LEDwizard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:42:24 2015 UTC,This is true =)  I thought about using a pump but I really wanted to mess with an arduino anyways so I talked myself into it.

microgrowery,3d9ovv,quickaeroponics,2,Tue Jul 14 16:51:55 2015 UTC,"Gravity feeding is nice because its easier. However NEVER put water above your lights. Especially if you are not home to deploy a fire extinguisher. Small pumps are pretty robust, I wouldn't worry about them failing. You can get small fountain pumps on the cheap and they last forever. Also, you might consider using a Raspberry Pi instead of an Arduino, that way you can use crontab to schedule your watering, its easier than having the arduino try to keep track of what day it is, and if you suffered a temporary power failure while you are gone the Arduino is screwed but the RaspPi would just pick up where it left off."

There's someone in my area who sells a soil ammendment that is groundu up rock they claim had some sort of crystals in it that align various magnetic fields and shit like that to fully realize the THC. I'm sure there are some beneficial minerals, but that's it.   One thing that constantly bothers me about cannabis growers is their willingness to accept illogical unscientific voodoo as solid growing advice. Every time someone removes all their fan leaves to get their plant to concentrate on buds, I want to pull my hair out. In 30+ years of gardening, I've never come across any reference to any other plant producing more fruit through defoliation. But then again, few people here have ever paid attention in high school biology, much less read a general vegetable gardening book to realize that half of the stoner growing lore is complete bullshit."

I want to say most people running 2k watts systems use some sort of AC in the summer time.    Consider a 2000 watt heater running in your room, because that is what those lights are going to be.  If you can't keep the room cool with a 2000 watt heater running, then your lights will definitely heat the room to the same level."

microgrowery,3d8fwj,6trees1pot,3,Tue Jul 14 11:33:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah this. Also you can tilt the whole pot to one side slightly, and the plant will make up for the tilt gradually. Then, you return the pot to original position and the plant will be naturally tilted to the other side"
microgrowery,3d8fwj,HairyGnome,3,Tue Jul 14 12:55:59 2015 UTC,"They're too far along in flower to do any sort of training, and they don't really look like they need any trimming.  Any leaf that is getting light, which most of yours probably are, will produce energy for bud/trichome production, so leave them on until they shrivel and die.  The plant also pulls energy out of dying leaves so plucking yellow ones before they die is like taking candy from your babies.  You should top this strain when it gets to 6-8"" tall and you'd get 4-5 tops on each plant instead of one per plant.  Do this during veg, you generally don't want to top the plants once they're put into flower, and once they start producing flowers you can stunt they're production by even touching them, so it to not really mess with them as much after the stretching is over and buds start getting alot bigger."

microgrowery,3d6imj,mindcrimez,3,Mon Jul 13 22:22:54 2015 UTC,Training is definitely beneficial outdoors. As /u/Justforpot said you should top your plant. Multiple toppings as well as LST will keep your plant short with a large canopy and give you the most amount of colas.
microgrowery,3d6imj,Cannabrew,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:30:44 2015 UTC,"I have two plants in my backyard that are doing very well but I'm wondering if training is all that beneficial outdoors.   Last year I did 1 blue city diesel with some super cropping. It was very indica dominant and was a big round bush. I have what looks like a sativa dominate plant, thought it was blue dream, that has long gaps between nodes. I'm concerned about it getting too lanky and needing lots of support.   The other should be boy scout cookies and has much tighter nodes.   Should I start pinching or let em go?"
microgrowery,3d6imj,Justforpot,4,Mon Jul 13 22:28:33 2015 UTC,Instead of pinching just top them. All the outside branches will grow out and up. Should keep the plants much shorter.

(Notice in picture)   What are some pest prevention measures I could take just incase something comes up that will not harm flowers?
microgrowery,3d5xcp,ErisGrey,2,Mon Jul 13 19:56:51 2015 UTC,"I see some bird shit, the big white leaf, and what looks to be some hard water deposits from rain or spraying the plants.   Where I am, budworms are a really bad pest. As far as pest prevention, I prefer predator insects and TLC. There are plenty of safe pesticide options. Azamax is a good one that is food safe, and can be used during flowering. Neem oil is another good pesticide.   Some completely organic pesticides get recommended occasionally. I don't have any experience with them but others might. Of those, simple liquid soap (not antibacterial), seems to be the base for almost all of the variations of organic pesticide. I imagine the one that is soap and cayenne/jalapeno/other pepper would be really effective if you are worried about animals eating or destroying your plant."

microgrowery,3d8bqf,quickaeroponics,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"You'd need to almost double the LED number you're talking about.    Whats the ambient temp where you're at?  2 1000w HPS will put out a lot of heat and if you've only run about 340w of lighting you'll probably have to add some significant cooling.  On the g/w thing for LEDs, you'd need to look primarily at the actual wattage, not the marketing wattage."
microgrowery,3d8bqf,quickaeroponics,2,Tue Jul 14 16:17:37 2015 UTC,"If the g/w rule really only applies to actual wattage, why in the WORLD are people paying so much for such little yields? Those four 300w panels I posted are only 680 actual draw total.. I would theoretically yield 680 grams with those LED'S vs 2000 grams with HPS? That's insane"
microgrowery,3d8bqf,X0dium,2,Tue Jul 14 23:33:22 2015 UTC,"No, its not as simple as that.  And the truth is that the actual yield will likely be between the listed marketing numbers and the actual wall draw.  However, I'd always aim to underestimate and over deliver when it comes to yielding.  And since the marketing number is often generated via ""voodoo magic"" and no real world, consistent and measurable value, I'd rather toss that number than the wall draw number."
microgrowery,3d8bqf,X0dium,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:51:52 2015 UTC,"Please remember the TOTAL cost of HID Lighting and not just the value of start up costs. Also, when you buy cheap HID Reflectors, Ballasts, and bulbs, you get what you pay for.   What's the efficiency of that reflector/ballast? Are those bulbs worth anything? How often will you have to replace the pieces of that set up? Do you have sufficient A/C for the area? Will that need to increase thus upping the total cost of having a HID setup? There are a lot of things to consider and not just actual wattage. While that's a good unit to measure to figure out what to put in a space, There is a lot more to consider when purchasing lighting then actual wattage. If you are only concern is start up cost, Go HID. You are going to get more wattage for your dollar to start. But be very aware of the heating issues and have proper cooling or you are going to start a fire, and it's very hard to explain that to the fire department."
microgrowery,3d8bqf,quickaeroponics,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:14:02 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the very informative reply, I actually an having a hard time finding articles / info about fires and grow ops. It's not really a concern with LED/CFL's, correct? Why are HID's such a fire hazard? Any and all info would be appreciated...   And I actually don't currently have any AC... If I use a cool tube hood and exhaust hot air from the light, should I be alright? How necessary is an AC with a 1000w? I have no experience with HID's, only LED lights"
microgrowery,3d8bqf,plainbraindrain,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:25:16 2015 UTC,"LEDs still give off heat. You are still running high powered lights. The thing with LEDs is the way the heat dissipates. I run 3 300 watt (not actual wattage) in a 3x3 and the jump from on and not on is about 5-8 degrees on Veg and 8-10 on Flower. But good air circulation helps combat that. I run a 315 CFM In Line Fan attached to a 6x16"" Carbon Filter and I run that fan at 30% in Veg (and detach the filter) and 100% with filter attached in Late Flower and I have NEVER had heat issues. That 10 degree fluctuation is the largest I have ever seen.  As for why HIDs are such a fire hazard, I think it has to do with cheap/bad wiring, especially between the ballast and reflector. I know another cause is lamps burning out or breaking and starting a fire that way. I'm just going off common sense though as I've never actually run an HID but I did a ton of research on both HID and LEDs before starting my grow.  As for needing A/C it really depends. Is the tent going in a room that is temp controlled? What is the avg temp of the room that you will be placing the tent in? If you can control the room temperature then I think you will be fine with a good exhaust system. If not then you might consider a portable A/C unit."
microgrowery,3d8bqf,PriceZombie,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:29:33 2015 UTC,"It's actually pretty hot here.... That's something I was thinking about also...  What options would I have for heat? I've seen 'air cooled reflectors' but not really sure how those work / if they are enough. My Temps are already 73-84F as it is, with the exhaust fan on high!"
microgrowery,3d8bqf,LEDwizard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:29:15 2015 UTC,"You will most likely need some AC to handle the temp then.  In room AC units (dual hose models) are a pretty strong option.  Mini-splits are also good.    Air cooled tubes are probably a must for you as well, they largely isolate the incidental heat from the lamps and let you pipe it out of the tent.  They don't do anything for the radiant heat, so you likely will still want AC with them but the cool tube tends to reduce the amount of AC you need.  For the record you generally will need about 4,000 BTU of AC for every 1000W of HID lighting."

Give it a week or so and they'll start to explode again. With DWC you have to constantly manage the reservoir, but you can't dance around it. Keep to a constant system and you'll start to predict the PH swings, water evaporating, ppm drop, what environment promotes slime, ect... When shit starts going south ALWAYS remember to make sure the basics are dialed in (PH, ppm, temperature, humidity, air flow, reservoir). 83 isn't crazy, but can cause some root. Lower the temperature to around 78 and it'll keep your reservoir cool preventing brown roots (root rot). I recommend picking up some ""zyme"" product for emergency slime protection in the future.

By the size of that plant in a solo cup shouldn't be getting a bunch of nutes.    Get them in bigger pots as you have a bit of height already. I guarantee they are super root bound already. Everyday of bound is a day you get very little growth. Lay off the nutes a little and let them recover some.   On a plant like that I'd stay with 1/4 - 1/4 - 1/4 on the flora series. Move them to a new pot water them in, no nutes.. give them a couple days for the soil to dry some then water with nutes. On a small plant like maybe 1/4 - 1/3 of a gallon of mixed solution. Then start following the grow chart on the GH site.   In my opinion you are a week or so behind on transplanting."

microgrowery,3d6pyy,The_Revolutionary,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:43:25 2015 UTC,"im pretty interested in one of those two i linked. i played around with the idea of diy lighting but i don't have the time, tools, or money to make something i'd be happy with. what are the advantages of each and why should i buy one or the other? the area i'll be working with is approx. 3ft deep x 6ft high x 6ft wide"
microgrowery,3d6pyy,Tree_Eyed_Crow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"If you're maximum height is only 6ft, then you might be better off going with T5/HPS instead.  You'd just have to give the plants a slightly longer veg time.  If you want to try out LEDs, you could do a small DIY fixture and add it to a T5 for veg.  I did this for my first tent, mainly because I had used T5s at work and saw the results, but wanted to test out how the LEDs would compare."
microgrowery,3d6pyy,Tree_Eyed_Crow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:18:18 2015 UTC,"from the top of the pot to the top of my tent would be about 6ft. Any reason i would use T5 rather than a MH and switch to HPS bulb for flowering? im diy-ing almost all other components aside from lighting, the whole idea is to keep cost as low as i can while still making it as efficient as possible for the space im working with."
microgrowery,3d6pyy,growingkind,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:32:10 2015 UTC,"When the plants are small and young they can't usually take the heat or brightness of a MH very well, so it is best to ease them from planting to about 2-3 weeks on T5s and then switch to MH for however much longer you want to veg, then switch them to HPS for flower.  It mainly has to do with acclimation.  If you had high ceilings you could just raise the MH up higher but 6ft might not be enough because the light is going to be about 5 to 5.5ft."

microgrowery,3d6pyy,COILTOIN,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:20:50 2015 UTC,"I'm kinda tired on the LED cult on this sub reddit. I've heard far and wide from this sub reddit to an abundant of hydroponic stores that one is far better than the other. They both have their ups and downs. LEDs are energy efficient. They use about half the power of their rating. Some are cheap and cheaply made. They emit a fair amount of heat but nothing compared to the bulb of a MH or HPS. LEDs can get expensive if you get serious.  HID setups are much cheaper in price and like the one you have listed, you would need to replace the bulbs each grow. Not bad cuz they only cost ~$11 on Amazon. They do use more wattage but you know what your getting in doing so. You need to have good ventilation with HID since you're good isn't designed to exhaust the heat efficiently. An air cooled tube for $50 would solve that ( along with some ducting of course).   Your choice ;)"

microgrowery,3d6pyy,Cbdjxbbxx,-6,Tue Jul 14 23:26:01 2015 UTC,"The only reason you'd want to go with the LED is if you can't manage your temperatures for some reason and need some help from the cooler running temps of the LED fixture, otherwise I would suggest going with the MH/HPS.  You'll get better yields in your grow area compared to have the same wattage of LEDs.  With LEDs you might get slightly better smelling or slightly healthier looking plants, but they'll yield half as much and the plants will be half the size compared to those grown with MH/HPS.  Source: I work in a 200,000sqft grow and we don't have a single LED... except in the tissue culture lab."
microgrowery,3d6pyy,Tree_Eyed_Crow,3,Tue Jul 14 00:07:04 2015 UTC,I'm not trying to argue anything you said but I would assume in a wide open grow like that or even a bedroom sized grow room HPS/MH would give you better light coverage and better yield. In a microgrowers tent I wouldn't think the difference in yield between LED vs HPS(same wattage) would be that great. I could be wrong though
microgrowery,3d6pyy,LEDwizard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:39:02 2015 UTC,the reason the LED appealed to me was the compactness of it all but if im risking a large difference in yields then i will stick to conventional.
microgrowery,3d6pyy,Tree_Eyed_Crow,3,Tue Jul 14 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"I just wanna say that guy is selling leds way short based on his commercial op experience (here on the closet grow board). Ive seen a solar flare 220 with a few supplemental cfls produce large yields with fat dense 10 inch cola tops. You just gotta tend well and keep the lights the right distance. Excellent flavor and potency.  Hps is cheaper and easier though, just gotta duct the heat out."
microgrowery,3d6pyy,LEDwizard,-1,Tue Jul 14 02:03:28 2015 UTC,"LEDs aren't all bad, you just have to get a really high-end one or just amp it up and get 4-5 of them to get the same results you'd get with MH/HPS.  Also ""results"" is relative so in my mind yields and quality of smell/potency are what qualifies as good results, and you can get good smell/potency with LEDs, but you just don't get much weight overall compared to MH/HPS watt for watt.    LEDs just don't have the same amount of light penetration as MH/HPS, so you end up with similar results in the top part of the canopy, but get less quality in the mid canopy with LED compared to MH/HPS, and in the lower canopy you can still get good results with MH/HPS, but the lower canopy doesn't usually get enough light with LEDs."
microgrowery,3d6pyy,Tree_Eyed_Crow,2,Tue Jul 14 00:42:36 2015 UTC,"but you just don't get much weight overall compared to MH/HPS watt for watt.   Not true.   LEDs just don't have the same amount of light penetration as MH/HPS     I see this myth all the time. What the hell even is ""light penetration""? If you mean the amount of light reaching the lower leaves, then it makes absolutely ZERO sense to claim that one type of bulb will outperform the other. What does make sense is to say red light generally does not penetrate through leaves because the energy is easily captured by the antennas of PSI and PSII, green photons are better at penetrating deeper into and through the leaves. Therefore, you could say that ""warmer white light will not penetrate as deeply as cooler white"" or ""red-heavy LED lights will not have as many photons reach the lower leaves."" Most people, however, seem to think ""light penetration"" is this magical quality that allows some photons to behave differently than other photons due to their source. Like ""5W LEDs have better penetration than 3W LEDs"" as though that extra 2 watts imbued the photons with magical abilities.    Furthermore (and I'm not attacking you I am attacking this myth) the importance of light reaching below the canopy is debatable, considering the plant is fully capable of moving sugars around its branches."
microgrowery,3d6pyy,LEDwizard,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:33:53 2015 UTC,"Light penetration has nothing to do with the spectrum.  It simply means that the light is brighter over a given distance.    For example if you use a PAR meter and measure the light intensity at different points in the canopy with LEDs compared to HIDs, you'll see that deeper into the canopy the PAR value is higher with the HIDs, meaning more photons are making it there."

microgrowery,3d5r44,Christomato,3,Tue Jul 14 05:37:49 2015 UTC,"This is called light deprivation technique. If your plant is small enough, you can use an over turned trash barrel. A few ways to do this. Cover the play at 7ish at night and open it back up at 7ish in the morning, making sure that it receives 12 hours of dark. Or- cover it up at 5am and uncover again at 9am.

It will cannibalize lower leaves, even healthy plants will. If you notice a lot in a short period of time it's probably hungry.    Your plant looks great, especially that third pic. You're right about the roots, a plants size is majorly determined by the size and health of its roots. I like transplanting a couple times before they get in their final flower setups. If you're careful to not over water you can start a plant in the pot you plan to harvest  from."

microgrowery,3d5v82,howlermonkey,6,Mon Jul 13 19:36:49 2015 UTC,"It is really best to avoid using total dissolved solids/ppm and always use E.C. (electric conductivity).  PPM has multiple scales 442x, 500x or 700x and often when people discuss ppm they rarely specify which scale.  To make things worse different nutrient companies use different scales without making it clear which one they are using.  The E.C. however is always measured as E.C, the electric conductivity of the ions in the solution.  1.1 EC is always 1.1 EC on every calibrated meter.  The industry should just put away ppm for good  Cheers"
microgrowery,3d5v82,greenmtnherbalist,2,Tue Jul 14 01:27:52 2015 UTC,"When ever you see ""per"" think ratio. Miles per hour. Thing is in ppm the unit is skipped because its usually referring to total parts.   Its a measure of concentration.  If we were making the same fertilizer recipe and I had 10x as many plants as you I'd make a batch 10x bigger but it would have the same ppm of nitrogen same phos ppm etc. Thyis way we can compare concentrations.   When you put a TDS stick in it doesn't know how big of a bucket its in but it can give a ratio of what's in there.   TDS stands for total dissolved solids.  IMO if you're a beginner its good to understand what it is but its not nessecary.  The more metrics you give to a newb the more they chase their tails.  I stopped ph'n and what not and honestly an organic soil grow gives amazing results without all the worry. Let nature do her thing."
microgrowery,3d5v82,mindcrimez,2,Mon Jul 13 21:38:37 2015 UTC,"Parts per Million (ppm) or Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is just a ratio that tells you how concentrated a mixture is.  For nutrient mixes in water the ppm value is telling you how much stuff is dissolved in the water.  If your tap water is starting off at 200 ppm then that means there are trace minerals and other chemicals already mixed in to begin with.  Usually this is just trace amounts of Calcium, Salts, and Metals.  You can use an Reverse Osmosis (RO) machine to remove the trace elements and get the ppm down to 0.    When you add nutrients to the water it is going to raise the ppm each time you add anything.  If you're shooting for 900 ppm in veg but have a starting ppm of 200, start off with feeding them a 700 ppm nutrient mix, and then bump it up gradually until you see some toxicity or burning and then back it off.  Then you'll know the exact amount you can feed with your particular tap water, which will have a unique mix of whats in it already, based on where you are."
microgrowery,3d5v82,Tree_Eyed_Crow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"If your tap water is 200ppm that is slightly high but not terrible. Mine is worse and I make it work very well, although filtration would be ideal and is in the works.  That 200ppm is most likely calcium and some other trace elements. Many local municipalities provide water testing results that tell you exactly what is in it. Or you can get your water tested if you really want to know."

microgrowery,3d5v82,HighsenbergHat,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:33:45 2015 UTC,"You know the ratio of your nutrient mix based on how you mix it. PPM tells you the quantity of your mix in the water. So to account for your tapwater, the PPM reading should be 200 above your target PPM."
microgrowery,3d5v82,thebub77,-1,Mon Jul 13 22:51:38 2015 UTC,"ok... this is pretty elemental stuff here. I suggest you start at the beginning and read some tutorials.. or you know... a book. about plants, preferably.   google says ""Just as per cent means out of a hundred, so parts per million or ppm means out of a million. Usually describes the concentration of something in water or soil. One ppm is equivalent to 1 milligram of something per liter of water (mg/l) or 1 milligram of something per kilogram soil (mg/kg).""   Easy.. right? ""per million of hydrogen""?! no... HELL NO..   So that basically means the amount of shit (useable nutrients, sediment, hard metals or whatever) in your water. If your nutrient guidelines say to add 900ppm of feed to your water, and your tap comes out at 200 (really high, I suggest filtration or reverse osmosis if you want to take it further), you should be getting up to 1100. Which is pretty high unless your plants are in heavy flower production.   Each nutrient or supplement you add to your mix is going to raise the ppm of the solution, some more than others."

Probably more or less negligible if you have clean water. My tap water is just over 100 (through a Boogie Blue filter) and I haven't noticed a difference doing it one way or the other. I'd assume it's best to factor it in, especially if you're dealing with hard water."

They will give off a bit less heat just because they have less infrared spectrums usually. The best way to beat an HPS with LEDs are the Bridgelux and Cree COBs and build it yourself since manufacturers have not really jumped on the new technology yet.

Compare that to.. let's say the Evo 360 from Growblu (Only used this panel because it's same wattage), that's 700 dollars. I've seen complete grows from both and can honestly say that the outcome is about the same. So why spend 100 more dollars and get the same product? Not trying to argue (Sometimes people say I come off that way) I'm just curious as I'm looking to build out a 4x8 flower room in the next 6 months and have been going back and forth with lighting."
microgrowery,3d4q5t,X0dium,2,Mon Jul 13 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"Simple, because the high end COBs are more efficient and you will easily pay for the difference in initial cost in a year or less just depending on what you are comparing it to / how long you run them per day. Also the COBs will last 20+ years at a lower amperage. That monthly savings adds up and you don't have to replace anything.  Get whatever you want, most lights will grow dank nugs, I just like letting people know there are better options!"
microgrowery,3d4q5t,thebusinessfactory,2,Mon Jul 13 20:52:15 2015 UTC,"LEDs are the better choice over HPS. I recently bought a 900w LED grow light and tested it against a 1000w HPS with the same exact setup in different rooms with clones from the same mother. The LED produced a better quality product as far as density/trichs and produced quite a bit more. The veg stage was noticeably better with the LED too.  My advice to you would be to figure out the type of LED light you want by searching USA vendors, and then go on alibaba.com or aliexpress.com and find the same model. All vendors buy their lights from alibaba, so just compare the technicals to identify the light you want. You will save a ton of money doing it this way."

There is a company on amazon called apollo led and ive used several of that type of model which i bought for 1/4 of the price fromthis chinese company   The lights work excellent and i would recommend going with the larger models instead of the smaller models if you are running around 100 square feet just to avoid all the cordage.

microgrowery,3d4q5t,black_edelweiss,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:15:26 2015 UTC,How much did you yield from that LED fixture if you don't mind me asking?
microgrowery,3d4q5t,Tree_Eyed_Crow,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:41:31 2015 UTC,"I yield slightly more with a 900w LED than with a 1000w HPS, and trich production is noticably higher. I generally grow blue dream from clones and veg for 3 weeks once the clone is rooted. A typical 900w led that uses 3 watt diodes uses slightly less than 3 watts per diode to extend the life of the product so you will actually only use 600w. It also doesnt require AC units or inline fans so you save on electricity with that also"
microgrowery,3d4q5t,black_edelweiss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:04:00 2015 UTC,How much is slightly more though.  I can yield 2-3 lbs per 1000w HPS fixture and just want to see how the yields from a similar LED might be.
microgrowery,3d4q5t,Tree_Eyed_Crow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:34:40 2015 UTC,"Vegging for 1 month in 20 gallon cotainers using coco, blue dream clones i yielded 1.4lbs and 1.2lbs with the 1000w. The same setup using 900w LED i yielded 1.8lbs and 1.7lbs. Of course, if you veg for a longer period you will have larger plants and larger yields. I did not top my plant or scrog them which of course would help with yields. My friend has a 1000w hps and same setup. He has taller cielings and is able to veg for 6 weeks and yields nearly 2lbs per plant. There is a noticable difference in the density and trichome production with the LED light.  2-3 lbs per plant indoors would have to be a massive plant. I dont have that kind of room, do you have pics of this 3lbs beast?"
microgrowery,3d4q5t,black_edelweiss,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:58:58 2015 UTC,I get 2-3 lbs per 1000 watt fixture not per plant.  I usually veg for  30-45 days depending on the strain and fit 3-4 plants in a 4x4 area under a 1000 watt HPS.  I just might have to try out an LED fixture next time I add to my grow.
microgrowery,3d4q5t,Tree_Eyed_Crow,2,Wed Jul 15 01:20:49 2015 UTC,"You won't find a clear answer here. Some people will say HPS, some will say LED. It's a full circle. Has been for a while. Will be until cannabis industry is property booming and companies get into real RnD."
microgrowery,3d4q5t,firesidematches,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:56:54 2015 UTC,"LEDs aren't really more efficient than HPSs, they don't give off near the same amount of light intensity, so if you want to truly have similar results, then you have to multiply the number of LEDs that are usually used by probably 4-5 times as many and you probably still won't get the same amount of light penetration deep into the canopy.  At that point they'll be using the same if not more energy and heat than an HPS.  If you are switching from soil to hydro then I'd suggest trying coco coir.  It is the best growth medium imho, and it is similar to soil, but you water it more and treat it like a sterile hydro medium, and in the end you get the same if not better growth and yields compared to other hydroponics.  Plants can get pretty fried when exposed to high temperatures for several hours."

The biggest thing I've noticed about the hydro galaxy lights is there is a ton of red, a few blue, and a couple of white LEDs vs a good mixture of the colors (leaning slightly red) on the Mars hydro LEDs.

I'm not sure what is causing the lower leaves to turn crispy but i do know that a lot of first time growers, myself included, overwater their plants.

microgrowery,3d4evu,HighsenbergHat,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like either to me.    It looks like there might be some Nitrogen deficiency going on.  The Nitrogen deficiency symptoms would be the yellowing of the lower leaves and subsequent crisping. This is because Nitrogen is a mobile nutrient within the plant and is pulled out of those leaves to support growth at the top of the plant when the roots aren't absorbing enough from the soil.    So to fix the problem you probably just have to let the soil dry out like normal and then feed a higher slightly higher strength nutrient mix next time, but there could also be the possibility that the problem is that the plant can't absorb Nitrogen because of nutrient lockout.  This is usually caused by the soil pH being too low because of a buildup of nutrient salts.  You can kill two birds with one stone and just water really heavily and allow plenty of runoff and what you'll do is wash out the possible excess salts and leave behind the nutrient solution you want."

microgrowery,3d2p6g,munkadelix,3,Mon Jul 13 01:21:13 2015 UTC,"I made a greenhouse in the corner of my chain link fence out of scrap wood, pvc, and plastic. It is above a 6'x8'x12"" raised bed. I just kinda made it up as I went. A couple structurally sound ideas would be a lean-to or an a-frame. Use 1inch pvc and connectors as a frame, heavy duty foggy plastic as your cover, packing tape to secure the plastic to the frame, and a few metal or wooden stakes to hold it down in wind. If you want to make it better use velcro to make a sealable door. Get a fan for circulation. Here's mine minus the top, I'm raising the roof one of these days when I have time.  Edit: if you can't see it from the street or public property you shouldn't need to make a greenhouse. It does help with humidity but also makes it harder to control temperature. Mine gets up to 90°F when the ambient outside temp is 75-80°F."

You would just have to buy some 10 mill black plastic and give it a consistent 12 hour light schedule. You could harvest sooner and get better weed.  Could you conceal it with a privacy fence?

She's Lemon G13... So frickin stinky.  I did consider building a structure around her and forcing flower now, I know people that do that in southern Cali with great results.   I have been feeding her, she began with lightly amended soil and has been receiving ACT every couple weeks. I honestly haven't really paid much attention to her, just keeping it simple. My indoor ladies are so needy!  She's super happy though. If I do find a way to keep her I will become more vigilant with the feeds.  Also, I have a full privacy fence that is 8ft tall.

I've had strains mature at the 56 day mark counting from 12 and others take as much as two weeks longer.

I went the cheap route, you could easily spend double what I did for better equipment, but is it really worth it? Not in my opinion.   Edit: try to get things with a 2+ year warranty. My vent tech fan died after 16 months. I got a new one for the same price with a 3 year warranty from my local grow shop. After a couple grows you will know exactly what you want to invest in.

While this theory has been thoroughly disproven, there is currently a lot of study into epigenetics, a process where genetic code is selectively turned on/off in response to environmental cues. Given that your clones plants are genetically identical to the mother, they may be expressing certain stress/resistance genes that were not activated before the mother was stressed.

Essentially they found genetic markers from a Russian famine in the grandchildren of women who were gestating a child during the famine. Those markers were found on the grandchildren, which were never is a famine. Fucking crazy"
microgrowery,3d0xsf,luciferprinciple,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:20:47 2015 UTC,"That study is actually what made me second guess the viability of clones from these stressed plants. Also, I've heard plenty of people claim that the quality of clones will degrade after they've had the moms around for a very long time. Perhaps there could be truth to it.  Also, you would think that if you cloned a person who lived through a famine, the clone would have the same 'famine genetic markers', so why wouldn't a plant?"
microgrowery,3d0xsf,luciferprinciple,2,Mon Jul 13 05:47:19 2015 UTC,"The reality is that although we can detect it, we can't measure a discernable negative effect post 1st generation exposure. We know it happened, but children of those exposed to famine are otherwise completely normal. Clones of clones of clones of plants can be virus ridden, carry bacteriological contamination, or be otherwise complete shit but if they are disease free a daughter of a stressed plant is probably fine"
microgrowery,3d0xsf,reductase,1 point,Mon Jul 13 05:58:39 2015 UTC,"I linked the Överkalix study in one of other posts in this thread, in which they found various phenotypic effects potentially linked to famine conditions that children's grandparents experienced. In OPs case, it's hard to say either way. The clones could be expressing stress/resistance proteins that actually make them stronger than the mother plant; however, they could also be diverting energy away from growth/flower production to make these proteins. While plants do not have a complex innate & adaptive immune system like mammals do, they do respond to stressors. With cannabis, this could be increased resin production. It would be a really cool experiment to grow two plants, intentionally infect one, and then compare clones from each. /u/norklebudz, report back with some data!"

microgrowery,3d0xsf,Wildfire9,3,Mon Jul 13 05:55:18 2015 UTC,"Systemic means it is everywhere. The cutting you take off a plant with a systemic infection will still have the infection.   While humans and plants are completely different, there are ways to get rid of systemic problems, like PM, in plants. These methods usually involve extremely harsh chemical fungicides such as Eagle 20 and Avid, which are horrible for humans (and the use by dispensaries of these chemicals was recently banned by the state of Colorado).   When using chemicals on cannabis it is extremely important to remember that the plant is an herbaceous annual that you will smoke. Just because it has applications for a woody vine like grapes, which will go through your digestive system, doesn't inherently mean it should be used on cannabis."

microgrowery,3d0xsf,tehbored,8,Sun Jul 12 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"Stress can induces changes in the expression of genes without changing the genetic code through modifications like methylation. The study of this process is called epigenetics.

microgrowery,3d0xsf,reductase,2,Sun Jul 12 19:26:12 2015 UTC,"Actually, this isn't true of people. Stress can induce genetic changes. It won't change your genes, but it will affect the methylation of DNA, which activates or inactivates certain genes. I don't believe this happens to plants though."

I have done a lot of training and I've tried a lot of methods. When it comes to LST or tying down terminal and lateral buds (high and low branches), anything is possible. Distribute those auxins!!!  When a plant is older you need to be very patient and work slowly as it will break easily. You will want to wrap string or wire loosely around a branch, I find it works best about 60 - 70% up from the base.   Now you will want to tie a string from the branch down to the pot or ground (outdoor). Lightly pull on the string until you feel resistance and then stop. Fasten the anchor to the line and walk away. In a day or two test it out and see if you can pull it down even farther.   Work slowly and you will be able to pull it off."
microgrowery,3d1ixd,Trees4twenty,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:15:21 2015 UTC,What will help you do this is watering your plant really well at night then bend the next morning. The added water in your plants will help them bend without snapping.

These were probably sufficient but I recently added a 900W to the mix to really have the best light coverage for flowering.  You can definitely get away with smaller lights in your veg rooms and then beef it up a little for the flower room to make sure you get the most out of your buds. As for temperatures, my flower room is in a garage and its consistently been 90+ here as well but I'm able to keep the room below 80 at all times without additional AC.

microgrowery,3d24hg,Justforpot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:33:56 2015 UTC,"Do you mean you have an excessive amount of foliage? All this means is that there is enough light for the plant to grow like crazy and therefore capture as much light for photosynthesis as possible. Its a good thing. When the days get shorter she will stretch out and fill the branches with buds. You can prune the plant but she doesn't need it at this point. Just keep doing what you are doing.  Edit: Looks like you may have a bug in the first pic so consider getting neem or azamax. And it looks a little pale may need nitrogen, consider veg nutes."
microgrowery,3d0k62,microgrowthrowaway19,2,Sun Jul 12 14:21:30 2015 UTC,"well are you watering when the pot is light and the soil is totally dry, or are you just feeding this plant ever couple days regardless?  looks like you have a few thhings going on, the plant is far too close to the light, and looks to be too big for the pot - I'm kinda guessing on the pot size cuz I cant really see it, but it looks like you just went far too long in veg.   if you dont have room to raise that light you really need to tie it over or the tops will just burn out on the light.   Did the leave start curling when you switched to bloom nutes?  I'd transplant into a proper sized pot with fresh soil, check to make sure your feeding the proper amount of food, on a proper schedule. and do your best to get it away from the light. It really needs to be trimmed and cleaned up, but you don't wanna do all of that stuff in flower, cuz doing all of that at once will be to much an you will shock it.   next time, before you flip to flower, make sure your plants have plenty of pot size, and are at a height where they can double in size, and still have plenty of clearance below the light source."
microgrowery,3d0k62,cutanddried,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:33:31 2015 UTC,The top leaves are doing fucking amazing I totally over grew before flowering I had it growing in my closet while I made a 4x5x8 foot box for later grows and took a lot longer than planned because of heat issues. I water elwhenever the soil gets dry and give it roughly a gallon of water its in a 5 gallon bucket that seems to look big enough guess not. The curling started after I started flowering and flushed it and got real bad after giving it nutes.  What size pot would you recommend? Also what kind of nutes and schedule? I can raise the light up another foot or so. Definitely a lot to learn anymore tips?

microgrowery,3cyou4,youngandstupiddumb,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:25:59 2015 UTC,"I choose this strain because I wanted a high yielding harvest. It is White Widow crossed with Big Bud, and Green Spirit which sounds alright to me.   Not to sure how she is going to end up weighing after she is dried, but I am sure it could be better. I started in DWC, and had to transplant to coco which took some time off root development. Also I made a scrog but cut it down because I added it to late and made it out of string which is not rigid enough for me.   The other two plants, have more girth in the colas, and the hairs have recently started to change colors. I think those two will probably go a week or two longer than the one pictured.  With all that said it should be a decent harvest."

microgrowery,3d15q4,NecroticFury,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:40:54 2015 UTC,Where did the gnats come from? Usually you should be fine with ffof as long as you flush it gently before planting to remove some of the hotness. But at this point you shouldn't have gnats unless they came from the miracle grow which isn't hard to believe. What I would do at this point is flush those guys well then use a very mild like 10% nute solution and give it a week. Stop with hydrogen peroxide as well those little guys don't like that. Treat the gnats after the plant is stronger if you have to.
microgrowery,3d15q4,Justforpot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:28:13 2015 UTC,wouldn't ffof cause at least the same amount of nute burn as miracle grow? Ill start giving them fox farm in a few days when I transplant to 5gal.
microgrowery,3d15q4,Justforpot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:38:46 2015 UTC,It's a much higher quality soil than miracle grow. Flushing it before planting the seedling removes a lot of the nutes that will burn a young seedling. And it most likely won't have gnats either.

microgrowery,3czfrv,Cannabrew,2,Sun Jul 12 15:44:07 2015 UTC,"Low stress training. You use tiedowns to pull branches down to almost horizontal with the plant. This allows you to widen the plant and maintain a large flat canopy. It also tricks the plant into thinking the side of the branch is now the top so it shoots new tops out, which means more colas. If you do a combination of multiple toppings and LST you can get significantly more yield."

microgrowery,3cxem0,jinqsi,2,Sat Jul 11 21:17:54 2015 UTC,But the whole point of the equivalent wattage is that it's supposed to be putting out the equivalent micromoles of photons in the visible spectrum. Haha

microgrowery,3cxem0,cutanddried,2,Sat Jul 11 23:27:41 2015 UTC,Exactly. The argument about actual watts per Sq ft being more important is almost exactly equivalent to saying the more money you spend the better off you are.

microgrowery,3cxem0,RonnieMac420,2,Mon Jul 13 21:34:23 2015 UTC,"I think somewhere along the line the community decided a common average of around 50w/sqft as a general guideline. Using actual wattage was used in this calculation. The equivalent wattage refers to what the bulb equivalent would be for an incandescent light and has no real relevance to growing.    There are of course better ways to measure light efficiency, but as a simplified guideline the watts/square foot is sufficient."

If people need clarification or specific questions on how to do a technique asking here would be good. There really isn't that much to learn in terms of the fundamentals of growing. Even HST (topping, mainlining..) and LST (tie-downs, ScrOG..) techniques can be done well your first time by just reading about it. People get all finicky and nervous about their plants which is a detriment to their final yield. People think they are somehow going to kill it by stressing it out causing them to avoid important techniques or going far enough with them. Plants are extremely resilient and hard to kill unless you do something very wrong."

microgrowery,3cxg3j,fiddygalluns,3,Sat Jul 11 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"I got the seeds from a homie when I visited him in Toronto. Don’t know exactly where he got them from, but he would only purchase from a legit source, (my educated guess is from Reeferman).  In regards to this specimen being a triploid, in my humble opinion it seems like one due to the appearance of certain traits : asymmetrical growth, double bud sites, thick leaves and stems, 4 sets of leaves at most nodes, pistil discoloration under black-light. In order to determine if it truly is a triploid I would need to take this baby to the science lab at the university down the road… Unfortunately I don’t have any insider connects at the Uni so I can’t use the lab. I did take 4 clones from this specimen- the only reason I flowered her is cuz a light fixture fell on her and the stress forced her to flower… So I got 4 clones and another 11 seeds, if anyone is a major “baller” and wants to fly me out to them so that we can research this strain together I’m all for it  Polished off a sample gram of this last night, blend of 90% green with 10% tobacco, bong snaps out of glass bong, clean smooth rips fresh aftertastes high comes along very rapidly (5-10min) predominantly “sativa ”style creative head high mixed with a “narcotic” feeling pain relief high!

microgrowery,3cxjz4,youngandstupiddumb,7,Sat Jul 11 17:51:31 2015 UTC,Way too wet. Your dying tips are due to rot because they are touching wet soil. Your roots need air just as much as they need water  Edit: the issue is that your plants are not big enough for that pot quite yet.
microgrowery,3cxjz4,H0FFM4N,0,Sat Jul 11 19:29:08 2015 UTC,I actually just transplanted a couple of days ago. The other pots were getting too small so I had to transplant to these. They took it well and I figured I'd go ahead and top and clean up the bottoms. The wet soil would explain the leaf rot. Thanks for the heads up I'll try and keep them from touching the medium.   O and I just let them go like 3 days no water and they were starting to slump so these pics are right after watering them.
microgrowery,3cxhzv,NightLightFright,2,Sat Jul 11 17:34:42 2015 UTC,I just let it dry out so that most of the roots and soil come off when I shake it out. Any root pieces that are too small to survive that won't really hurt anything. You could rinse them in water but that sounds like a mess.

I'd imagine less hungry sativa strains would be better suited, or do they all seem to be happy with the same levels? Do you add rock phosphate to your system at all?"
microgrowery,3cspck,ThatsMrDorkToYou,5,Fri Jul 10 15:51:38 2015 UTC,Some indicas seem to stress alot when we put them in the system initially. But others that are also pure indica don't. For example ak47 seems to freak out and lose maybe 1/4 of its leaves when we transplant the clones into the system even from an AP mother. But warlock which is afghan x skunk both indica does not so it seems very strain dependent and my thinking is it just has more to do with ph shock going from soiless rockwool and nutrients that way to half soil half hydroton. After a week or 2 they all do just fine but some do seem to stress after transplanting more. I have been messing with my soil mix to get the ph lower to see if it helps but so far no luck.   Rock phosphate is one of the things we use. In the book I'm working on I will have full dosing charts for water vs soil layer vs foiliar vs soil amendments and even some fish foods to boost certain nutrients or gain desired effects on the system its the thing that is taking the most time right now as far as finishing the book up. Just testing stuff in our smaller test grows over and over to see whats best for what uptake and what not with our system design. Its been a ton of fun and a huge learning experience in regards to fish safe nutrients that we can also apply back to herb and veggie growing as well. I'm currently working with an organic nutrient company to get this nailed down so that aquaponic cannabis growers will have the same number of tools to adjust desired nutrients as hydro people. To my knowledge there is no top to bottom dosing option chart for aquaponics so we are building one right now :) Its been 2 years in the making. If you have any suggestions or anything you'd like us to try let me know and I will see what I can do to add it to the list.

This plant is coming up on it's 4th week since germinating and it's been through hell having lights fall on it, fungus gnats, burnt a couple fan leaves. When can I push it into flower and change to 12/12. This is the height of it right now, haven't topped or done anything except remove the first set of leaves near the bottom because they yellowed, and the cotyledons are falling off. http://imgur.com/eTl4DrW  I started this plant in a solo cup and maybe three days ago moved it to this larger cup since it's all I could find at the time.

People naturally think HPS is hot because you can't touch the bulb while you can bump an LED.   Doesn't matter if you have one 500w bulb or fifty 10 watt bulbs there's 500 watts in your closet.  More power in more heat in. Doesn't matter who's bringing the power.
microgrowery,3ctfvz,Mac_drevious,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:54:57 2015 UTC,i think the HPS is better cause you get more light penetration than leds and it can be way further away
microgrowery,3ctfvz,mindcrimez,1 point,Sat Jul 11 00:35:56 2015 UTC,... It has to be further away from the tops of plants.  This gives LEDs an advantage when height is an issue.
microgrowery,3ctfvz,Mac_drevious,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:05:28 2015 UTC,of course. but thats a benefit to me. because you have to constantly adjust LEDs and keep them as close to plants as possible. whereas the HPS could be put anywhere and still give light to the entire plant. (has a buttload of light distribution and penetrates canopy)
microgrowery,3ctfvz,mindcrimez,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:59:14 2015 UTC,Sometimes maximum height limit determines the lighting  of indoor grows.  An LED setup will allow much more vertical growth in the same tent as an HID setup.  If your lights are all the way up in your closet/tent/growspace you've got a lot more height before your lights burn your plant if you're running LEDS than HPS.
microgrowery,3ctfvz,Mac_drevious,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:46:41 2015 UTC,i agree with you there with the tents. but in closets/rooms HIDs are fine as you have up to the top of the ceiling and plants rarely get taller than 6-7 ft tall. not to mention usually only needing one light for several plants.  id say LED is def better for small grows and stealth for sure though.

The less energy you use the longer its going to take to get the work done.    There's a minimum amount of light (and the right light, PAR) you need for a healthy plant, the more you have the faster they can convert light into growing until they have too much.    You want to consider how much light you need for your space to be covered by at least the minimal healthy amount, which is probably like 2000 lumens (of PAR) per square foot.  totally rough estimate depends on a lot of variables.  On the other end of the spectrum you can safely run a 600w 95,000 lumen HPS bulb in a 4x4 tent and grow 4 monsters at around 10,000 lumen per square foot.  I've grown great results under CFLS, i just had about 250 watts surround 1 plant.  I loved building my own reflectors and adapting CFLs to fit them and my growspace best.  One thing to help you consider how much you can use is about 1800watts for a typical US household circuit.  Thats not 1800w per jack thats per circuit, usually 1 per room or group of rooms.

microgrowery,3crxlt,Mac_drevious,1 point,Sat Jul 11 02:35:43 2015 UTC,"what about LED components going bad? Ive heard of people buying ones and the IC components are the first to go, not the lights themselves. (to be fair its really easy to  fix if you are electronic savvy) if not you have to buy a whole new panel or exchange it if warranty is available  400W HID bulbs are only 10$ each and I doubt anyone goes thru one in 6 months. thats an ideal one for small grows. also there  are only 3 main components to HID lights; ballast, socket w/reflector and the bulb itself.  personally to me the most ideal setup would be to use both. HID on top while LEDs/T5s on the sides."
microgrowery,3crxlt,NecroticFury,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:01:15 2015 UTC,my light has an extremely long warranty so they would just replace it.  That's why I buy from a good company.  5 years on my warranty.  With an LED no Ballasts required.. just plug and play.

I theorize that some of the allergic reactions can be attributed to bugs, mold or pesticides too. I know a woman who has been trimming since the 70's as her full time gig, and doesn't have a problem until it's time to trim sour diesel, and headband, then she dons long sleeves and a mask."

microgrowery,3cua8a,Fizzy_T,3,Fri Jul 10 21:04:59 2015 UTC,Gloves are friends! Honestly it's good practice to always wear gloves when handling bud at any stage. Contact with skin can only harm plants.  I know someone with the exact same thing tho. She doesn't smoke anymore so idk how that affects her but gloves cure any handling issues
microgrowery,3cua8a,Fizzy_T,2,Fri Jul 10 21:21:15 2015 UTC,thanks... will do. it just kinda sucks cause i even start breaking out when throwing it into the grinder and packing a bowl. maybe i should start using tongs or something...
microgrowery,3cua8a,reductase,2,Fri Jul 10 21:38:08 2015 UTC,I actually use a metal 1/8 teaspoon to pack bowls. If your grinder has a magnet then you can attach the teaspoon to the grinder while it open and you're taking a hit. Works pretty well.
microgrowery,3cua8a,JimmyTheDog,2,Fri Jul 10 21:45:58 2015 UTC,"Sounds like an allergic reaction to me. Any repeated exposure to a foreign substance can eventually elicit an immune response to that substance. Latex gloves were a big deal for healthcare workers because wearing gloves many hours a day for years on end caused people with no latex allergy to eventually build one. You should invest in a few boxes of nitrile gloves. Steroids like hydrocortisone will alleviate your symptoms, but chronic use will cause your skin to become very thin and fragile."

microgrowery,3cqmvp,ExoticStrains,2,Fri Jul 10 01:14:28 2015 UTC,"Dig a hole in the ground under each one and fill with your soil, then with the plant and bucket on sawhorses go under it and grab the plastic holes you put into the bucket with pliers and break away as much of the plastic as you can. From there place the bucket on the soil in the hole and go for it. You could do just one and compare it to the others when done. Of course having a friend pull the bucket off the plant while you hold the stock would be easier."
microgrowery,3cqmvp,Cannabrew,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:53:57 2015 UTC,Take something long and flat like a ruler. Go around the inside of the bucket to seperate the dirt from the bucket. Tip out the plant and transplant into larger bucket. Already half filled with soil. Loosen the lump of dirt that was in the bucket you just transplanted from and fill in the remainder.

microgrowery,3cqmte,LEDwizard,2,Fri Jul 10 04:28:40 2015 UTC,So the printer power supply goes into the buck booster and that up volts it to 33v correct? Isn't that only enough to power one 100w COB? Can you educate me how that's able to power 2? I have access to lots of power supplies and this may be a good cheap way for me to do this too. Also if the COB is at 3.5amp and 33v isn't that just about max for the COB?
microgrowery,3cqmte,IbuyWolfTickets,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:53:24 2015 UTC,"Just based on the pic I believe he is running 2 COBs off the printer PS, which means they're each pulling half the current."

microgrowery,3cqmte,firesidematches,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"They were super cheap chinese ebay drivers, I think they were $12 a piece with free (very slow) shipping.

It covers my 26""x36"" tent just fine but that didn't stop me from keeping the 90w Bloom Boss LED I had in there before int here with it. How far you choose to space the COBs is the biggest factor in coverage. These things are fkn bright though, I try to stay at least 18"" away from the plants.    Found the ebay link...I went with the 50W 1500mA version. No voltage boosters or anything so long as you choose the right driver specs for whatever your COB needs."

microgrowery,3cr9cq,LazyGrower,7,Fri Jul 10 03:22:27 2015 UTC,Wind chill factor only relates to the perceived decrease in temperature felt by the human body on exposed skin. It therefore has no bearing on your plants.
microgrowery,3cr9cq,Stewagen,2,Fri Jul 10 05:53:28 2015 UTC,"I've heard the same from a reliable source. Wind (ventilation) does move the air around and can cool things down but it can also increase heat if the ambient temperature is higher than what is presently hitting your plants. ""Wind chill"" refers to our human response to temperature. Essentially, you want good ventilation and just about exactly the temperature you're getting."

microgrowery,3cr9cq,Canna_Man_Growery,2,Fri Jul 10 03:27:01 2015 UTC,I think you're over thinking things with the whole wind-chill factor. Wind chill is something people came up with to tell you how much colder it will fell to you SKIN. You might be playing with a .25 or .5 a degree.   Now being able to hold your hand under the light? That would be because the fan is cooling your skin.
microgrowery,3cr9cq,vhdblood,2,Fri Jul 10 07:00:50 2015 UTC,"I read your answer and it makes complete sense. Thank you. But then I asked myself why do the books and the all knowing internet tell me to increase the air flow if it is too hot in the tent?  I found the answer: http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/wind_chill_doesnt_really_matter_to_a_plant  ""Plants are usually close to air temperature. On a cold winter day, they are close to the temperature of the air. If the wind blows hard it cannot cool down the plant any colder than the air temperature. If the plant gets colder than the air temperature, the warmer air will warm the plant. On a sunny day, if the plant warms in the sun it may get much warmer than the air if the conditions are calm. If conditions are windy, then the plant will only get a little warmer than the air as heat is carried away more quickly.""

microgrowery,3cqh5h,horycwap,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:39:05 2015 UTC,With a 60 day autoflower you'll harvest in 60 days from seed. Not sure where OP is but if i planted today and it started to flower in 40 days it probably wouldnt be ready for harvest before frost happens.
microgrowery,3cqh5h,GOASTT,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:43:43 2015 UTC,I started one in late June in a 5 gal bucket once and got a little over an ounce from it. Around 3 months of potential growth or half the season has already gone by but you could probably harvest enough to make it worthwhile still

I always keep the vent in the wall closed. Anyways, I capped the duct in my basement and hooked my inline fan to the other side that goes upstairs. So far so good but I haven't used my heater yet. I don't know why it would cause any problems though.    My situation is a bit different though...you are trying to push air the wrong direction and back into the furnace. Mine flows the proper direction, just is connected to my tents rather than the furnace. As long as your hvac is totally off...it probably won't hurt but I would in no way run it like that if the system is on. Wait for someone that knows more than me to decide, it's probably the most dangerous component in your house."
microgrowery,3cprub,thebusinessfactory,2,Thu Jul 9 21:08:03 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input you're situation seems to work out great, effectively heating your house while growing some treasures! I would much rather have too much cold than too much heat getting major swamp balls.  Totally agree on the potential danger. In my mind I see it going fine, but I also see myself driving up to my house on fire or exploding or in a fiery explosion cluster. The hvac pipes are visible in the garage so I was thinking of disconnecting them before they hit the heater just to be extra safe. I'll wait for a bit more input though.   Thanks for the response happy growing."
microgrowery,3cprub,Zanalingus,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:03:43 2015 UTC,"When I exhaust in my house it pulls air through my house and often fucks with the furnace I get airflow errors. It does not effect the a/c. It also has developed the habit of blowing out the water heater pilot, that could just be a shitty old water heater problem though. If your system is electric I dont see that being a problem. In the winter I reverse my light vents air flow back into the house. This heats the house and prevents the furnace/water heater error. That vent is not connected to the central air/heat system though."
microgrowery,3cprub,purp13rain,3,Sat Jul 11 01:12:45 2015 UTC,82F is definitely not hot enough to necessitate any major changes. Adding an extra A/C definitely won't hurt but I wouldn't vent the wrong way in your HVAC. As long as you're consistently under 85 I wouldn't do anything drastic.
microgrowery,3cprub,weedconnoiseur,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:02:51 2015 UTC,"If it is set up like I am imagining there shouldn't be and issue. Does your light's hood have an air intake and exhaust outside the room already? If not, I would use the fan in the garage in place of the heater and pull air from a separate source or carbon filter. Both should reduce heat from the light. Hopefully this helps give you a visual of what I'm getting at."

I'm guessing that is why they have been growing outwards as well.  edit: just found a thread where you said they are white widow and there is a 300w mars hydro as well
microgrowery,3cqpdk,tinyplantas,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:43:58 2015 UTC,Hey plantas!    These are 2 white widows from ILGM.com  Not sure about how good the genetics are from them but no real problems thus far besides my own mistakes.  Its my first grow and this started with cfls but I ended up getting a marshydro LED with 130 true watts and it sure has helped.  Also i just installed the strip lighting yesterday and its a pretty shotty job but it will have to work...  I have some CFLs that i plan to put back in but temps are extremely hard to control where im growing and its driving me nuts!  I have progress all the way from the start but reddit is hard to navigate that far back haha.  I'll be watching your grow so don't let me down!

I don't think it was stressed at all and the little black/rustic spots have seemingly subsided. My plants are stinking too, I don't know if it's the plants or the new soil but it's very earthy and my roommate is noticing it. And I guess the strip lighting is making them grow outwards but I will tie them down after a few days of monitoring the post-op top.  I guess since I'm ahead I'll be the test rat haha.   Stay tuned bud and hope you have a good weekend."

Video: https://youtu.be/nCHYIhJNwMQ  After reading a bunch online and talking to another caregiver friend, it looks like the ppm of the vaporized water should only be about 10-20. That being said, those trace elements are probably only from the copper, aluminum, and may be other elements in the unit itself.  The only other thing I can imagine that might cause problems would be any sort of bacteria build up in the unit. The reservoir is easy to clean, but I don't know how you would clean the inside of the unit. Just make sure you are clean your filters monthly.  I will probably be doing a test on this on my YouTube channel in the coming weeks. Maybe I will just test the water on one plant. I think I am getting between two and three gallons a day, so it seems silly to waste all that."
microgrowery,3coviy,fregrowli,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:44:27 2015 UTC,maybe a slight charcoal filtering could help before you splash on your plants...or filtering through one of those life saver drinking straws if you are worried about the quality.
microgrowery,3coviy,ubguessin,2,Sat Jul 11 19:23:29 2015 UTC,I use dehumidifier water when I am running it. Treat it like distilled. .
microgrowery,3coviy,ModernDayNeanderthal,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:01:32 2015 UTC,If you have a ppm meter you could at least test the runoff water to see if it contains many contaminants or not
microgrowery,3coviy,Poacc,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:21:26 2015 UTC,"I don't know about the quality of the water from the dehumidifier (my guess is that it would not be harmful if the unit is well maintained), but  it won't contain any nutrients. So unless you are supplying nutrients directly into the pots, your nutrient solution in their reservoir will become more dilute all the time. Eventually you will just be growing in pure water, and your plants won't like that."
microgrowery,3coviy,TheChonk,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:45:00 2015 UTC,I wouldn't trust a regular dehumidifier as you could get some pretty nasty chemicals from those coils.

microgrowery,3cr0e2,LazyGrower,2,Fri Jul 10 03:50:34 2015 UTC,"Definitely from the top. Try to make your canopy as large as possible to most efficiently use light, especially because you are using florescent. Topping and LST are essential in doing this. Keep the lights fairly close to the tops for deeper penetration and shorter internodes."
microgrowery,3cr0e2,Cannabrew,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:10:47 2015 UTC,"Light hitting the undersides of leaves is wasted because the plant cant absorb as much light from that side. Unless you had a vertical reflector most of the light emitted isn't directed at plants, rather at the walls - instead of the top of the leaves. Vertical lights create shadowing, along with various other reasons.   If you have unequal lighting, your plant will grow disproportionately bigger on one side in an attempt to reach light."

(or to grow with gravity in the case of roots)  Phototropism- the tendency of a plant to grow towards light.  There are various other factors that can influence direction, for example many vining plants will respond to touch which causes them to grow around things"

microgrowery,3cmzom,Molinkintov,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:42:13 2015 UTC,I was always taught to break up root balls.   I didn't know there was such a heated debate around it though with no clear answer.   I would say read this over and make a decision for yourself.  http://forum.grasscity.com/outdoor-medical-marijuana-growing/373125-break-up-root-ball-when-transplant.html  The logic is breaking the root ball encourages the roots to grow faster in the correct direction.
microgrowery,3cmzom,Hjalmark,2,Thu Jul 9 09:28:59 2015 UTC,Lol that discussion is literally every other person is against it with good reason and the ones for it have done it successfully a hundred times with amazing success rate.  What I got from it is if your delicate and only fluffing up the roots then it's okay but the less you mess with them the better.
microgrowery,3cmzom,GreeneryJoe,2,Thu Jul 9 13:39:53 2015 UTC,"Yea, so was I by my mother and grandmother.  They told me to loosen the roots from the soil, not tear it up, just loosen. I'll read up on it. Thanks"
microgrowery,3cmzom,Trees4twenty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:06:40 2015 UTC,It's my understanding that you should be careful not to disturb the root growth as much as possible.
microgrowery,3cmzom,youngandstupiddumb,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"Speaking with my knowledge with farming I found that to be a terrible idea, you want to keep as much of the soil around the roots as possible because the time microorganism have spend breaking down nutrition around the root zone and thus avoiding stressing the plant as much as possible  root trimming on the other hand is something I not tried yet but sounds like it could be functional for plants with root structures like cannabis"
microgrowery,3cmzom,youngandstupiddumb,2,Thu Jul 9 10:43:26 2015 UTC,"Root trimming is a great idea when keeping mothers long-term. I don't see why it wouldn't be a good idea at other times, too, like if you're transplanting after a plant has already outgrown it's pot and the roots are circling the edge."
microgrowery,3cmzom,tigrisend,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:32:06 2015 UTC,nope. you want to keep the ball intact so that you don't break the root system and slow down the growth process. they will expand quickly from the small rootball that it is now. the less you mess with them the better.
microgrowery,3cmzom,tigrisend,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:03:03 2015 UTC,Awesome man! Looks exactly like my transplant! Did you stick with the same mix of FF OF and perlite? Add any nutes or just ph'd water? They already look happier too!

About an inch.   Get something to stick in the ground, like a stake, or even chop sticks (my personal favorite) and tie her around it to give her support.   One thing though, you know she's about to start flowering right? Unless you're in the southern hemisphere. Which wouldn't make sense either because it's winter there. So, even if she recovers from this, I can't see you getting much yield from her."

I've lost faith in my girls before, only to have them bounce back and look beautiful.   You haven't been giving enough water. If it's regularly above 90F in your location, you should water almost daily. Stick your index finger into the dirt up to your middle knuckle. Is it wet that deep? If yes, wait another day to water. If no, water until you get run off out of the bottom of the pot.  That last part is important, because this is a water loving plant. Even more so when it's very hot."

Consider getting a tent to put inside,with a light and everything. It seems complicated because it is, at first. But read enough about it, make enough mistakes, and then you understand it, and you'll find yourself making adjustments and seeing improvements. Next year, plant in May/early June depending on temp/light period. Train your plant using FIMing/super cropping to increase yields. Cannabis doesn't yield much without human intervention.

microgrowery,3co4hf,Trees4twenty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:44:16 2015 UTC,"you have to treat them like having kids, they need things. if you forget them they die. i would say with the way the stalk is degrading at the bottom end its probably only going to make it a little while longer. seedlings this size don't really need to be out in full sun yet either. you could be burning them up. also it should grow a lot longer before flowering. flowering outdoors won't start for yet another month or so. so you have a little time left to veg one."
microgrowery,3co4hf,Trees4twenty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:10:17 2015 UTC,ok so you reckon the problem was too much sunlight? or too little water?
microgrowery,3co4hf,cheef0,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:20:45 2015 UTC,"that would be my guess. i usually don't start working my plants into the sun until they have a few sets of leaves, this also allows the roots time to grow so the plant can maintain its water level while in a container in the sun. small containers will heat up faster and bake out all your water and your roots. i try to get them in at least 1gal before the sun. and i wean them into the sun, start out under a shady tree and work your way out into full sun"
microgrowery,3co4hf,Trees4twenty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:24:44 2015 UTC,"interesting, thanks for the insight. I always thought that they should get the most light possible specially in the seedling stage.

microgrowery,3cppwo,blpsoup,0,Thu Jul 9 20:43:44 2015 UTC,The pot is a 2 gallon pot and I would pour a cup or two in (faucet water). Not exactly sure if that is enough. Id say the soil is moist but not damp or dry. Its more damp closer to the stem. Underwatering and lack of light seems like the issue.
microgrowery,3cppwo,ubguessin,3,Thu Jul 9 20:50:51 2015 UTC,"The rule of thumb is to wait for the soil to be dry a knuckle deep, then water until water comes out of the bottom of the container. The real game here is ""The Law of the Minimum"". The weakest resource your plant has available will be the ceiling for it's maximum potential. CO2, Light, Oxygen, Water, Nutrients, and Medium all dictate the outcome of your plant and are all equally important. Adding a seed to some dirt and watering it will indeed make a plant, and if you keep it alive, it will indeed eventually flower. To get the most out of that plant and the effort, put as much as you can into making your weakest available resource to the plant 'better'.

I also like to start pinching parts of my plant until you hear the cell walls kind of pop, dont use your nails just the skin between your fingers.  this will start to strengthen your plant to hold its heavy buds.

Everything else has been re-purposed materials that I had laying around. I have some landscaping fabric left over from a flower bed I made a few years ago.

microgrowery,3cnkt3,Hjalmark,2,Thu Jul 9 10:59:47 2015 UTC,"When you buy the 400W, and plug it in, your plants aren't getting 400W. Probably around 150. My 600w Mars hydro LED uses 280 ACTUAL WATTS. This is to make the LED panel last longer. So I'd go with your original idea and get four. Three would be fine too.   Mars hydro on eBay is $160 for a 600w led. BTW"

microgrowery,3cnkt3,thebusinessfactory,4,Thu Jul 9 20:44:25 2015 UTC,"I would pass on Mars, you probably won't be super happy with the results compared to the 600w HPS. No doubt you can grow some bomb plants with them but IMO if you are going LED, you need to go all out, not try to save $$. I have done a lot of research on many different LED companies and built 2 of my own COB lights...take my opinion for what you will.  Also, the extra room from those lights would be nice but if you are running 840 or 720 watts at the wall, you won't have less heat than a 600 watt HPS. With LEDs you need to surpass the efficiency of an HPS (~30-35% if it's new w/ clean reflector) to really see the benefits. This is mostly only possible with Cree and Bridgelux COBs  driven at a low current. For example, a Cree CXB3590 [36v] at 700mA is 58% efficient and would CRUSH an HPS of the same wattage."
microgrowery,3cnkt3,thebusinessfactory,2,Thu Jul 9 14:54:05 2015 UTC,CXB3590 huh? I'll look them up. Pass on the Mars... even at 1 400w per plant?  I mean I am not opposed to building my own. I have component electronic experience and can solder pretty good. Just kinda lazy haha but if its a lot more efficient and cost effective i would.
microgrowery,3cnkt3,thebusinessfactory,4,Thu Jul 9 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"The energy savings will make up the initial investment in under a year at 58% efficiency. You will need a LOT of COBs for 5x5 though. For that space, I think that 4x MeanWell HLG-185H-C700B drivers would do it. Then you would need 8x CXB3950s per driver for a total of 32 COBs. That would run you about $1700 just for the COB and drivers though. Then you would still probably need COB holders (cheap) and 4x monster heatsinks with 1 140mm fan each. I'm guessing total around $2k. With that said, it will destroy any other pre-built light out there no question. That would be about 800w at the wall with 4 of those.    Do whatever you want though, HPS, Mars 2, CXBs will all grow pot, it's just a matter of your grow constraints, budget and effort you want to put in. I personally loved the time I put into my lights and knowing they are saving me on my power bill but to each their own! Oh and these lights will last 20ish years running at that low of current. Nothing to replace!    Check this thread for an almost identical setup to what I mentioned."

The drivers to properly control a LED lamp aren't cheap and you must have a good electronic/software background to be able to get a good lamp, you want most of the electrical output to be under a good PAR conversion and just not a lot of ""wasted"" lumens. I personally think that the best LED lamp in the market is the 880 solar storm from california light works, it comes with a pair of T8 UV lights at 285-315 nm, those are antimicrobial and bacterian lights (the same light used in SteriPEN) they are expensive, I think they are a bit over 2 grand."

He should move that a LOT closer. To within 15cm.  Yeah they could have been buried deeper but it looks like they got over it.   So in pic 7 and 8 you show the leaves sort of taco - ing in shape. That could be due to a minor stress or simply the genetics of that plant and it seems to be effecting only one? Doesn't look like something that warrants any major worry.  Those spiky things in pic 12 are normal stipules.  Now those plants are going to double in size, or more, when they flower so if he's not changed the lighting schedule to 12 hours on 12 hours off then now's the time. Ideally you'd have the lighting hood down within 30cm of the top of the plants and raise it as the plant stretches up."

microgrowery,3cn383,Stickybomber,2,Thu Jul 9 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"Man I'm a new grower but I'll give it a shot.   You probably want to completely enclose and capture the light. It looks to me like all that nice light he's paying for is leaking right on out and away from the plants.  Also, more lights. Looks like you're running two 54w t5 bulbs and a 60ish w cfl? Man honestly I would get 4x that amount of light on them when flowering hits. Fluorescent lighting doesn't carry very far so keep them close to the plant maybe 2-8 inches if possible.  You'll also help to avoid stretching to find light. Keep in mind plants get about 2-3x bigger in flower and you might run out of space soon. Maybe look into low stress training to keep them low and spread out.   What soil is it in? It looks super dense from the close ups and cannabis loves loose, airy soil. Make sure you have adequate drainage on those buckets, the soil looks very moist. The plants look like they aren't deep enough because roots should not be exposed.    While we are at it, how often are you watering and are you using nutrients yet? How old are the plants? Did they start from clones?"
microgrowery,3cn383,Stickybomber,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:43:36 2015 UTC,He used fox farm for the soil. He says he has been feeding/watering them 18oz each of water mixed with roots organic and cal-mag?  They started as clones and he says he brought them home on June 6th. so 32 days old?  Edit: I really appreciate the reply. I am going to show him this in the morning and hopefully get him to make an account. You mentioned you would get 4x the amount of light on them when flowering hits. Does this mean the light he has now is ample? And when does flowering hit? (he may know this but maybe not)
microgrowery,3cn383,jweeze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:54:04 2015 UTC,"Nice, fox farms is good stuff.  It sounds like the roots organic could be nutrients? If so make sure not to add them every watering, rather every other. 18oz of water doesn't sound like enough. Are those 5 gallon buckets? I usually put 2 gallons of water per plant per watering in a 5 gallon bucket. One, not adding enough water means you water more often. Second, you don't really flush out the extra salt build up and it will start to accumulate over time and could harm the plant.  Make sure to ph balance the water somewhere around 6-6.5 or so and try to get soil ph around the same.    If he isn't adding balanced nutrients now would be a good time to start.  They look mostly healthy. The plants typically require less light during the vegetation stage which is where they are now. They could benefit from more light now but mostly during flowering you'll want more light to create dense buds. You'll want about 3000 lumens per square foot. That's about 60 watts or so per square foot with average florescent bulbs.  Some people also say 100 true watts per plant minimum, and I try to run 200 watts at least per plant."

microgrowery,3cn383,Stickybomber,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:03:19 2015 UTC,"ill add to this.. excessive run off = a lot of extra moisture and humidity, that equals PM, bud rot etc.   water only when the pant needs it, you cant say ok I'm going to water on monday and thursday. you may have to water one twice before the other one uses its water up. just lift the pot if its light water it. or what you can do is water it and watch the plant. if it takes 5 days for the plant to start showing it needs water next time water it on the 4th day.  ph is super important although I've harvested 3.5lbs outdoors on one plant and never phed the water once."
microgrowery,3cn383,assfed,1 point,Thu Jul 9 15:18:07 2015 UTC,"It depends on the size of the plant and how hot it is, but yes usually with the soil I use I find I only really need to water ever 5-7 days for plants during veg.  I go for 30% runoff when I water."
microgrowery,3cn383,LEGALinSCCCA,0,Thu Jul 9 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"flowering is started by giving them 12 hours of uninterrupted darkness each 24 hours. (putting a timer to 12h on and 12h off)  they are already too big to flower in that area, mj will double to triple in size during the first 40% of flower (first 3-4 weeks of 12/12).  cut the top half of branches off of each plant and allow 1 week to reestablish vigor.  if the area can be increased in height then flip them in to flower immediately.   light drives plants.  light dictates yield. if your a half decent grower it's reasonable to expect .75 grams per watt of light used for the entire flowering cycle.  triple the light at the least, best bet would be a 400w HPS bulb.  maintain 70-80 degrees and 50-60% humidity, day and night.    always water till runoff and allow containers to dry to about 30% residual water weight.  using a simple floor scale, when the top 1/2 inch of the soil is dry (i'm recommending a conservative estimate) weigh the containers, then water till runoff, and weigh again.  do NOT water until they need it, ideally always just before they fully dry out, but don't feel the need to push them to dust. that's why ~30%. keep in mind that hotter than normal days will increase the speed the soil dries.   switch to a 1 part bloom formula for the first 7 weeks of flower, then tap water for the last 2-3, depending on trichome color."

microgrowery,3cm3m5,maxxl,3,Wed Jul 8 23:44:19 2015 UTC,"They're deff not showing sex yet. The most important thing is to get them seperated and into some decent soil mix. After that get yourself some nutes there are plenty of brands out there General Hydroponics (has great customer service), I've heard Fox Farms is good too, Canna, Dynagro, Technaflora are some other brands. Most importantly MEMORIZE the ""beginners guide"" in the sidebar."

microgrowery,3cm3m5,heyderjohn,2,Thu Jul 9 00:02:40 2015 UTC,"I second that they need to be separated. The bigger one likely has roots through most of the pot now, so do it very carefully and slowly so's to not damage or break them."
microgrowery,3cm3m5,Goats22,1 point,Thu Jul 9 05:05:07 2015 UTC,"Separate those two ASAP! Also get them on a good nute schedule, I can see the beginnings of yellowing tips which may because they are hungry for nitrogen. Get a PH test kit and make sure you're keeping the plant between ~6.2-6.8 otherwise you'll lock out anything you're feeding it. Nutrients can be pretty acidic so you'll want to pick up some ph up to keep it at a good level.  Overall they are looking pretty happy, though!  Do some reading on super cropping, something you might want to think about (but don't necessarily have to) doing."

It would be better if you made a separate hydro container for it, as peach roots will spread throughout a whole bed normally, and that's non hydro so hydro will be worse. Otherwise looks great!  Are you growing with natural day night cycle, or are you supplementing with lights?"
microgrowery,3chf86,ErisGrey,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:20:25 2015 UTC,We plant the fruit trees in big dual root zone pots we make out of half a 55 gallon drum. They work GREAT. There are a few out of the picture that are waiting to go to there finally spot in the greenhouse I just haven't had time lately. Its an ever evolving greenhouse lol.    We are using natural day cycle. We veg them indoors and flower in the greenhouse. We have lights to supplement in winter to keep it at least 11 hours when its below that.
microgrowery,3chf86,roythehamster,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:47:49 2015 UTC,"Nice, I've seen people make terrible mistakes with hydro beds... Good decision with the 55's... You might want to look at root pruning in the off season to help keep them under control, in addition to the vase pruning...  And you are using poly as a covering? I'm a horticulturist and have been wondering if poly would be enough light and direct light for bud plants... I'm in Texas, and if we legalize I'm going to throw up greenhouses of bud and have been prepping greenhouse designs. I was going to go for glass and long stem rose design utilizing a hydro set up and supplement with lights and shade cloth. So what are your experiences with bud and poly film?"
microgrowery,3chf86,SweatyButcherMeat,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:25:19 2015 UTC,yea just a dual layer poly covering. I wouldn't do glass to much chance of shattering there are so many good plastic panels out there now that are just as good and way less shatter resistant. If your in texas you will get hail eventually. You don't want to lose your crop to that.
microgrowery,3chf86,pushkill,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:43:43 2015 UTC,"Have you inflated the air gap between the layers?   Hahahaha I wouldn't use normal glass but tempered glass (aka auto glass)... The transmission is the same, durability is WAY higher, and like glass you never need to replace unless they break, which is very rare with tempered glas on greenhouse. You can get small and HUGE panels, and everything between. They constructed a Quonset style tempered glass house at my university when I was studying there, and it made it through a violent hail storm that trashed all the other houses, even double poly houses and soild panel plastic houses.   But I appreciate the thoughts... I took a greenhouse design class and learned quite a bit about greenhouses and structures and the various materials and products that can be used."

microgrowery,3cjd1f,CannabisGardener,4,Wed Jul 8 10:54:39 2015 UTC,"I always harvest right before the light comes on. As soon as the lights come on, photosynthesis starts and your plant is going to begin up taking water and possibly any leftover nutes.  I think of it as though I'm ""draining"" the plant at night, and then chopping before it starts ""filling"" up again."
microgrowery,3cjd1f,AdamBarnhouse,3,Wed Jul 8 15:02:29 2015 UTC,Its more like when the lights are off/on the plant produces certain hormones that effect growth.   I've heard that at night is when your plants primarily produce resins. So it would be optimal to harvest during the day when resin production is slowed.

microgrowery,3cjd1f,tmonz,2,Wed Jul 8 12:40:14 2015 UTC,I harvest right before the lights/sun shine. The buds seem to smell more at this time.
microgrowery,3cjd1f,SweatyButcherMeat,2,Wed Jul 8 13:55:52 2015 UTC,"Here is a good article about harvesting.  ""Timing the harvest is Paramount to the final quality. Harvest your precious buds in the dark, just before the lights normally come on. If possible, do not allow the plants to see direct light as long as their roots are attached. Direct light on a plant will draw up stored starches and sugars from the root system. During the nighttime hours, our ladies are busy storing food down in their root system that they made during the daylight hours. During “lights out,"" starches and sugars produced by photosynthesis during the day drain downward to the roots. Knowing this, it is easy to figure out that you want to cut your plants away from the roots before the lights come on, when food moves back upward into the buds.    Outdoor herb is often harvested during the daytime hours and the result is a harsh, difficult burn and an extra long cure. The starches and sugars present in daytime-harvested herb act like fire retardants—not the effect we're looking for. In addition to tasting and burning bad, these fire retardants also change the chemical make up of the smoke you're ingesting. This means that the THC, cannabinol, cannabidoil and other active cannabinoids can't burn at the perfect temperature to get you properly high because they haven't properly converted to their psychoactive forms."""
microgrowery,3cjd1f,Fizzy_T,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:01:56 2015 UTC,"From my understanding you want to harvest right as the light comes. This is because terpines are used to ward off periditers and are released through the day, and regenerate at night, so in the first hour you should have the strongest terpine profile"
microgrowery,3cjd1f,grumpy_gardner,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:25:17 2015 UTC,Technically the best time to harvest is before any light is on the plant. During the night the amount of terpenes and terpenoids increases. This is your flavor and smell of the plant. Thus the reason for the smell of marijuana gardens and such are stronger in the morning than the evening.

I've hit a roadblock waiting for my new LEDs but once they're in the updates should come rapidly.  There's only two light cycles in progress but I can switch a plant from one to the other with ease. It's just a matter of switching power points.   The three different spectrums are an accident. They should all be warm white.  The two vegetating plants are in hempy buckets and my first foray into hydro. So far so good and they seem well suited to the system. I did make a mistake and not give the perlite a thorough wash and pH balance before putting it to work. The type I bought is quite alkaline and dusty sending my pH into the stratosphere. I'm still coming to grips with it but it's a volatile problem.  http://i.imgur.com/lXlECjn.png  http://i.imgur.com/XqAi0Z2.png  There are are only two things that I do that I haven't seen others do before.

microgrowery,3cf181,Mearbert,3,Tue Jul 7 18:29:43 2015 UTC,"It's a fair point. There are few reasons to build one of these instead of a tent.   I can have the entire op secreted in less than five minutes. Thankfully I've only had to practice this but its reassuring to know that I can if I need to. I do have to pack up my grow every three months and its not a big deal at all and interrupts nothing. Gives me a chance to vacuum properly.  Grams/watt. My leeroy harvest yielded 75g dry from 120W with lots of room for improvement. No lumens are wasted. Because all of the light generated is either hitting the plant at close range or hitting a nearby reflective surface, that's the theory anyway and there's still lots to prove. Soon the entire unit will pull up to about 750W from the socket and allow six plants to be fully grown.  I really enjoy building/improving on it. That's probably the main one. If I didn't have the time (plenty of it an accident) and inclination to try new things then a tent would be in action.  It's also comparatively cheap. Each pod costs me about $100 including lights."

microgrowery,3chtvq,weedconnoiseur,2,Wed Jul 8 00:51:36 2015 UTC,I would start by checking the ph of your run- off then if that's normal look into the soil for some sort of mite/pest. If nothing seems to be helping go for a straight water flush with maybe some silica.
microgrowery,3chtvq,weedconnoiseur,2,Wed Jul 8 06:28:52 2015 UTC,I checked the runoff and it was 6.97. A little high so I flushed with 4 liters of gradually lowered ph all the way down to 4.5 but the run off was climbing. Ended up going up to 7.2 before I stopped. What's going on here?
microgrowery,3chtvq,weedconnoiseur,2,Wed Jul 8 13:49:46 2015 UTC,I usually have my experience with hydro/coco but if it is climbing the more you flush I believe there is some leftover nutes in your soil. Do you water with just straight water from time to time or has it been just straight nute feed?
microgrowery,3chtvq,weedconnoiseur,2,Wed Jul 8 18:59:16 2015 UTC,Straight nute feed for last 5-6 waterings. Started about a week before flower and every watering has been with nutes since except this morning when I gave them low ph water.
microgrowery,3chtvq,weedconnoiseur,2,Wed Jul 8 19:49:22 2015 UTC,Were those at full strength?
microgrowery,3chtvq,grumpy_gardner,2,Wed Jul 8 20:14:45 2015 UTC,"I have the flora series from GH. The first watering was .5ml floragro, 1ml of micro and 1 ml of bloom per liter of water. I left them for about 5 days and they got quite a bit bigger so the next watering I started full strength and removed the grow nutrient because they're autos so I knew they would start flowering within the next week which they started showing pistils. This is the formula I've been using for the last 4 waterings.  floramicro: 1ml/L Florabloom: 2ml/L  Except the last watering with nutes. I found I've had to water more often because they got a lot bigger so I started watering 2 liters to each plant instead of one liter and in that watering I simply doubled the nutes so 2ml of micro and 4 ml of bloom and that's when I noticed the black mark and now they're getting rusty and dark spots."
microgrowery,3chtvq,grumpy_gardner,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:25:19 2015 UTC,Alright I think that's where you are having the issues. I looked up the recommended feed and it looks like you are on the right track with feeding for a one-time feed during the week (try to make it on the same day/time every week) and use ph balanced water to keep it going until the next feed time. If you want to feed it nutes every feeding you're going to have to reduce it down by 1/4 or a 1/3 depending on the frequency during the week. If you feed the full strength amount more than once a week it builds up salts in your soil and raises your ph creating burn or nute deficiencies from ph imbalance. I have had some plants that can handle the amount of nutes that you are  giving it and sometimes even more but you have to be careful with the ph I would flush it with more to bring it up to 6.

microgrowery,3cj95c,originfoomanchu,1 point,Wed Jul 8 10:20:39 2015 UTC,How many cfm is your exhaust moving? What's the size of your enclosure?  You want enough cfm to replace the air 2-3 times per min or more with this high heat.  You might try using both fans as an exhaust with a passive intake and vent into a separate room or even better vent outside. Run the lights during the cooler hours too   I am running nearly 400cfm on a 2.5 x 3 x 5 ft box and still hit mid-high 80s when it's hot out. Without AC you really just move the hot air so try to get it moving as fast as you can

One is the above cytokinin theory, the other is I am trying to minimize the free area on the floor of a 4x4 tent. I tried a few different optimizations and ultimately decided a 3x3 of 16"" pots would give me the highest volume of soil with zero open tent floor.

microgrowery,3cfi2r,X0dium,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:25:00 2015 UTC,Ah ok.  I thought maybe you were adding them from another plant/source somehow.  I really like large containers.  It seems like quality stays really high every grow and the plants just seem so healthy and vibrant.  The larger size holds moisture in a good way and it seems to help growth stay consistently fast.  I lose less fan leaves in larger containers also  I know what you mean about wanting to fill up the bottom.  That's why i usuallly use rectangular tents and just line the bottom with plastic sheeting for drainage and cram as much soil in as possible!

microgrowery,3cfi2r,ThePotanist,2,Tue Jul 7 16:22:47 2015 UTC,Not sure how much of a difference it makes but those pots are pretty see through which means lots of lights will be hitting your roots. This may not be the case for indoors but I was under impression that it was not good for the roots to be in direct light when they reach the pots.
microgrowery,3cfi2r,jazzytime,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:25:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah that's actually intentional with smartpots, the air/light penetrance at the soil boundary encourages the roots to self-prune and branch, instead of turning and running."
microgrowery,3cfi2r,ThePotanist,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:21:08 2015 UTC,Smart pots aren't see through or transparent like yours. They block the light until the roots reach air. Then they self prune. Your roots will see the light much earlier. I choose smart pots over the aurora pot for this reason. But it could be a non factor in all honesty.

I guess I was hoping for an explanatio as to why it wouldn't matter see through or not. When I looked at purchasing these aurora pots the guy at the shop showed me how much light comes through as if it was bad thing. Your plants always seem to be doing great so I wasn't questioning your ability. Mind if I ask what you put in your ACT? I currently use boogey brew and have been loving it because it's so easy amd has everything. But is it better and cheaper to brew it on your own?

For ACT I keep it simple: 1) 2 gallons RO water, add 1 cup of worm castings and 1/4 cup of blackstrap molasses 2) Aerate the FUCK out of it for 48 hours 3) Add two more gallons of RO water and drench plants and soil"

microgrowery,3ch81q,pufpuff,3,Tue Jul 7 23:14:20 2015 UTC,for outdoor are you in the ground or in a pot?   the ground or a huge pot will save water better than a smaller pot; but the huge pot takes more water to saturate :P .  have a nice layer of mulch to retain moisture as well; and have a foliar sprayer and maybe hit them with water on  days early or evening.   that is all i can think of and do.  maybe get some beasty indica plants or strains hardy against high heat or somewhat lower water needs
microgrowery,3ch81q,Anarchy-peace,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:08:52 2015 UTC,Yeah I chose a supposedly heat resistant strain(mikromachine auto from kanabia) and I'm glad to say they are living up to that claim. They seem perfectly healthy so far despite the temps getting up to 110F.

microgrowery,3cfmap,thebusinessfactory,2,Tue Jul 7 16:58:31 2015 UTC,"I have and do use this. Sanctuary makes a soil called Victory that is their version of FFOF. Empire Builder is Sanctuary's super soil, taking Victory up a notch. EB is the same price per cubic foot as FFOF (EB is $20 for 2 cu/ft vs. FFOF $15 for 1.5 cu/ft. which comes out to $10 per cubic foot for both soils).  I currently have 36(?) plants sitting in EB in fabric pots. They have been in veg way too long (3 months or so) as I deal with AC issues before I flip the switch. No nutrient deficiencies as of yet, and I don't even pH my water. Because of my AC issues and flower time, I expect I will have to feed this batch closer to the end of the flower cycle, but that is my fault, not the soil's.  This will take MOST plants through a 1 month veg/2.5 month flower cycle. I've had some heavy feeders require some nutrients toward the end of the flower cycle. I usually just hit it with some General Organics BioBud and call it a day.  FWIW, I also use this soil in some of my potted veggies like tomatoes and peppers. The veggies that are planted in EB grow like gangbusters, while the veggies (also tomatoes and peppers) that are planted in Kellogg Patio Plus soil (cheap home depot soil) showed calcium and magnesium deficiencies from the get go."

microgrowery,3cfmap,thebusinessfactory,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:04:25 2015 UTC,"I've seen something similar before. And I'm sure there are mixes available. Basically you'll have to see if the mix has what your cannabis needs to thrive. Often times alfalfa meal,soluble potash, kelp/seaweed additive,mycorrhizzae,azomite and others make a good ""super soil"". In my opinion I would rather construct my own soil by buying seperate ingredients and following the super soil recipe online.  It may be more costly but you would have a good ratio and your cannabis will thrive. Otherwise look for the recipe online. And look at ingredients and see if you can find a mix that incorporates these different elements."

microgrowery,3ch1i9,jenabell,2,Wed Jul 8 01:56:18 2015 UTC,lady bugs dont really eat spider mites. Use kapow. Its the only thing I have found that kills them off completely. Not saying it will always work but so far it has for me in 2 indoor grows and a greenhouse.
microgrowery,3ch1i9,PotentPonics,2,Wed Jul 8 01:23:17 2015 UTC,"Hey,  spidermites are very easy to control. Depending on temps they will reproduce faster meaning you need to spray more often. If your room is 90 or above spray every 2-3 days, any less 3-5. Should spray 3 times before you can be confident they are gone. It is very important to spray bottom of every leaf and all over stems of plant, also depending on what your spraying get the top of your soil to get eggs that are knocked down. Azamax is a great product and kills all stages of mites including eggs. A drop of original dawn dish soap in the mix helps if you are really under attack."
microgrowery,3ch1i9,H0FFM4N,2,Wed Jul 8 09:12:41 2015 UTC,It is the larval stage of the lady bug that eats the most tiny bugs. So not really effective in an emergency situation because you need the ones you buy to reproduce first. Use neem oil.

microgrowery,3cgauj,6trees1pot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:08:20 2015 UTC,Overwatering is difficult to recover from.  Especially with a sprout that has few roots.  In addition to the overwatering issue you are growing in a windowsil which tells me you really arent interested in growing good weed.  I would suggest lots of study on proper setups.

microgrowery,3cgauj,6trees1pot,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:25:00 2015 UTC,The mold is from overwatering and not drying out in between.  I would suspect that either letting the soil dry out and or transplanting into another container will ultimately need to happen.

You might consider checking your carbon filter for air gaps and leaks, or adding another before using ONA. If money is no object and you want to keep your grow perpetual, invest in a small ozone generator and stuff that in your outgoing exhaust pipe. *edit: I'll add, I've seen ONA being used when a grow was being exhausted through an outside clothes dryer vent.

I am starting my second grow, and am planning an outdoor Auto in TLO soil.    Germination Stretch Question: Did I mess up? And if so, what can I do to help them? [Iranian Autoflower, outdoor, soil, not move outside soon enough]    One month check in, I don't know what is going on. . .    Day 61, Iranian Auto (Indica), outdoor soil [more info in comments]      Day 75 of my two 90 day Iranian Auto Flowers, Trichomes under a USB microscope!    I made a gif with my USB microscope and a flower sample tonight! Look at those trichomes!    Q&A with /u/bong_sau_bob from /r/autoflowers     Would you recommend the strain to grow it again?      I would totally recommend growing this Iranian Auto strain again,  here is the link to Dr. Greenthumb's site  http://drgreenthumb.com/cannabis_seeds_GreenthumbSeedsEntrance.htm  Dr. Greenthumb has fast and discrete shipping on their seeds.  In another thread I mentioned their shipping was so stealth I did not know they had arrived until I was going through the mail at the kitchen table.  Once the plants got over my mistakes they took off and were 100% self sufficient.  The only thing I did was pinch off a couple smaller flower sites at the base of the branches to reduce the popcorn buds.  No topping, No LST, No FIMing, No feeding or nutrients, only dechlorinated Ph adjusted tap water in a soil mix based on The Rev’s 2.1 soil. For this harvest I did not try to make the mongo colas like on my first grow.  I went with smaller buds while trimming and will try a slower dry time to improve the cure.  The amazing thing about Auto’s is how fast they are from start to finish and how they do not care what the sun cycle is!    Would you mix the soil differently next time, how might you change it? Do you see any point in the spiking and layering he does?       Great question! I would not start all 10 seeds at the same time.  That was my big mistake and did not give me time to investigate and fix any problems.  For me and my space, I would have started 3 and got them going, then wait 4 weeks to start another 3, then wait 2 weeks and start my last 4.  That would have given me time to discover they are a little more tender than a photo plant in veg stage.  This is all because I think (remember to include n00b factor) my soil was too hot and I did not compost it long enough.    I do not think the spikes would have been beneficial to my grow as I cannot take care of a plant well enough for the plant to benefit.  When I have just growing down, then I will consider spikes and layers.     What's growing next?     Next up is 3 Girl Scout Cookies and 3 Sour Diesels.  These guys are in the ground, in 24 in deep holes with the soil mix. (you can kind of see them in the dark outside photos)  This might be a good experiment with spikes, as the dirt around the hole is just crappy clay.  I could see the plant eating up a lot of the soil based nutrients.  I see teas playing a bigger role in the summer photo grow."
microgrowery,3cdyih,samsreddit92,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:08:22 2015 UTC,Very cool.  I would love to see an update with the dry yield when you have it.   I'm becoming very interested in growing autos due to high humidity in my area during harvest time for photos.
microgrowery,3cdyih,Xponic,2,Tue Jul 7 04:25:46 2015 UTC,"I will keep the group updated.  I got 14 oz from 3 photo Atomic Northern Lights last year, so I can divide and compare (per plant and per month of growth).  But the Autos will always be smaller due to their fast veg and flower."
microgrowery,3cdyih,Xponic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 04:41:46 2015 UTC,"Did you check the trichomes? It looks like you harvested a bit early. Since this is only your second harvest I will dole out some advice.   Do not under any circumstance clip anything off of an auto ever again. You're just hurting your overall yield. Nobody likes popcorn but you can always make extracts or edibles if you think it's not worth smoking.  Get a jewellers loupe and start checking your triches before you harvest. You want about 10% amber, the rest ""cloudy"" If there are still fat white hairs all over the majority of the plant and not just a few spurting out of the colas...it's not ready. Trichomes are the best way to tell but the color and size of the hairs is also a good ""starting"" indicator.    If this is was a Sativa strain I'd still say you chopped too early. But some of those have a tendency to run so long I'd never wait for ""full maturity"" if this was my second harvest.  Best of luck with your future grows!"

microgrowery,3cfr8j,clm93,3,Tue Jul 7 15:51:54 2015 UTC,"organic compost, just mix it in with the soil when you dig the holes and then top dress the plant with more compost when it thins out.

microgrowery,3cey8l,SuperbTomatos,2,Tue Jul 7 11:34:58 2015 UTC,"Both hempy and regular pots work with coco.   I would say it is more maintenance than soil, sometimes needing to be watered multiple times a day or every day, but can be reused without amendments and gives very quick growth, some say faster than soil. It also can yield more per root volume."

microgrowery,3cey8l,Risky_Clicks_NSFW,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:05:46 2015 UTC,"sometimes needing to be watered multiple times a day or every day   I've found the opposite to be true.  I've been running pure coco for YEARS now and I only have to feed/water them once-a-week (growing in 5 gallon buckets).  However, the temps in my room are right around 80 degrees so I don't have much evaporation."
microgrowery,3cey8l,MakeItLegalBitches,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:30:04 2015 UTC,"You might be using too large of pots, which sounds counter-intuitive but many people believe that coco actually performs better in smaller pots. The idea being that smaller pots actually allow you to water more frequently, which is actually better for growth and health as you are introducing more dissolved oxygen and nutrients more frequently to the root system.  What do you yield in a 5 gallon on average?"
microgrowery,3cey8l,bluehat9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:34:21 2015 UTC,"Not who you asked, but I do coco in 2 or 3 gallon smart pots depending on the strain size. We water every other day, rarely every 3 days. It gives more opportunities to either fert or add preventatives. Yields are better than when we used 5 gallon pots, but that can be subjective."
microgrowery,3cey8l,FatZombieMama,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:31:27 2015 UTC,"Interesting... I have never even considered pot size as a limiter for growth (because, like you said it runs counter to the pot size==more root mass==better growth method of thinking).  Average would be a bit difficult to come up with since I run about 6 strains (4 of which are constantly changing) and 10 plants on a 10 week schedule, in a perpetual grow under 1500W (upping to 2000 this weekend when I run new electrical).  The last plant I pulled netted 100g, but the next one is going to be a shit yielder (terrible pheno of Mango; I'd be shocked if I got 50 grams on this guy).  I also have to make concessions on my grow methods since every plant moves every week (can't ScrOG, etc).  So, if I were to try and average them, I'd have to say 90g/plant or 900g total or about .6 grams per watt..  Not great, but again some concessions need to be made due to the way I grow.  However because of your suggestion, I'm definitely going to try a couple different size pots and see what the results are!"
microgrowery,3cey8l,MakeItLegalBitches,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:53:17 2015 UTC,"I think there's a balance to be had. People who promote this type of thinking with coco usually say that the multiple daily feedings that a smaller pot necessitates are the secret to achieving incredibly fast hydro-like growth with coco, but you have to listen to the plants, right?  I'd love to hear what your results are if you do end up experimenting a bit."
microgrowery,3cey8l,bluehat9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:58:48 2015 UTC,"I'm planning on running side-by-side experiments using only different size pots (2 & 3 gallon) and keeping strains & nutrient schedules identical.  I want to see if that by itself will improve yield enough to change the way I grow.  I rather enjoy the relatively maintenance-free way I do it now, so the results will have to be pretty stellar."
microgrowery,3cey8l,MakeItLegalBitches,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. Do you use a reservoir or do you mix nutes every time you feed?  My only point is that a 2 gallon pot with the same size plant should dry out faster than 3 gallon (or in other words require more frequent watering).  I've especially noticed the effect when transplanting a newly rooted clone. If it goes into a pot just a bit bigger, it quickly fills it out and needs water frequently and grows bigger quickly. If its a much larger pot, it takes a long time to fill out the pot, doesn't need to be watered as often, and seems to get somewhat held back until it does fill out the pot with roots."
microgrowery,3cey8l,bluehat9,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:08:11 2015 UTC,I mix for every feeding; only having to do it once-a-week is easier than running a reservoir.
microgrowery,3cey8l,MakeItLegalBitches,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:16:32 2015 UTC,You have your yields dialed in to the level you would be able to see that kind of difference? I'm impressed!! One day I hope I can get dialed up like that!
microgrowery,3cey8l,Canna_Man_Growery,2,Thu Jul 9 01:57:36 2015 UTC,I have been using using coco hempy buckets for my last few grows and I can't recommend this style enough. The growth rate is significantly faster than soil and by using the hempy style you have to water far less often. You also get the benefits of hydro but you can move your plants when needed and don't have to worry about reservoir changes or maintaining pumps and air stones. I've made a few mistakes but seeing the rapid growth is worth it. Plus you can easily wash coco and reuse it.

Although they look very healthy and loving the sun, it either looks weirdly deformed in some of these pictures if they are girls, but if they are boys then they look pretty good. Take into the account of getting more seeds before chopping them if they do turn out to be boys. Best of luck"

microgrowery,3cefmi,vaporizeTV,6,Tue Jul 7 07:14:25 2015 UTC,"Are you doing this for personal use? If so, I don't think co2 is worth the investment and operation costs. Yes, you'll get better flowers, but how much better? You might be better off spending that money in others areas of your garden.   Here's an example. There's Honda civics you can buy that are gas and there's hybrid civics as well. Everyone knows the hybrid civics get better gas mileage, but they cost $7k more than gas models (I don't actually know, pulled that # out of my ass). So, how long does it take you to actually make the car worth the extra $7k? If fuel prices stay the same, it's longer than the average person owns a car. So it's actually less expensive to own the gas model, at least in the short, average usage term, even if you don't gas up as often. Maybe that's a weird analogy, but I think you could spend the money better elsewhere. Co2, imo, is for the advanced grower who has already exhausted all other resources."
microgrowery,3cefmi,Treefarmr,0,Tue Jul 7 07:34:12 2015 UTC,"This, but with a note: you might actually get WORSE flowers. CO2 changes ideal ranges for humidity temperatures and feeding so if you don't have those set up properly you are not only wasting money on CO2 you are actually hurting your plants"
microgrowery,3cefmi,HairyGnome,2,Tue Jul 7 12:35:17 2015 UTC,The question with co2 is usually about how you are going to handle heat management. Yes you can get killer results in a sealed room with co2 if done correctly. But this usually requires a dual tube portable ac unit that will intake and exhaust from outside of the room. This way you can keep temps at 85 and run 1500ppm and as much light as possible. With that size room and co2 id run two of those 1200 watt panels. Co2 only benefits if you have the available light for the plants to synthesize. So basically you want to flood that room with tons of intense light. You will go through 3 #20 bottles of co2 in one flower run this way but the results will be absolutely killer. Oh and this is assuming you are running everything else perfectly. You need to have your nutes dialed in perfectly for this to work and know exactly how much food the plants need to take advantage of this supercharged environment. Any stress will hurt the results and could cost you money. So yeah it's pretty hard. In my experience I've found that supplementing co2 twice a day during lights on by shutting off the exhaust fan for an hour gives me very good results. I will use way less co2 and get a good return on investment. All without needing the extra ac unit and extra power usage.

microgrowery,3ce6vy,GuttermanBrigadier,2,Tue Jul 7 05:31:53 2015 UTC,Weekly changes of the reservoir are recommended but I've gone two and had no issues. I set the nutes and ph down the solution when it's fresh then just ph the water after topping off the res with fresh water without nutes. This dilutes the solution but it gets changed out a couple of days after topping off anyway so it works for me. I don't actually move my res as that would be to big of a pain. What's easiest for me is to pull the tube off the tray and pump the old solution out into a heavy duty trash can then down the drain or in my yard it goes. Never down the storm gutter as that can send nutes into the lake and cause Eco problems. I've never seen my ppm increase as the reservoir gets used so not sure where you saw that.

Im sorry i dont have a link on mobile, but icmag forums have an organic section. Read the organics for beginners sticky. I think with organic tea there is no ""best recipe"". Most recipes ive seen look like a combination of the same fundamental ingredients with variations here and there. A lot of it has to do with what is available to you locally. The beginners guide also has recipes fpr soil. Remember that in organics, tea is food for your soil, and your soil makes food for your plants via beneficial microbes. My biggest mistake so far was not letting my soil sit to allow microbes to grow. I had to supplement one of my seedlings with 1/4tsp of grow big due to a nitrogen deficiency. The guide also mentions that you dont have to ph but i do anyway using organic ph adjusters from earth juice i believe. Hope this helped out. Good luck and good decision on switching over to organics!"

microgrowery,3cd311,groventures166,1 point,Tue Jul 7 00:26:25 2015 UTC,I would suggest finishing this batch and starting with a clean slate next round. That will give you time to research and gather the ingredients. If you get the soil mixed now and let it sit until you are ready for the next grow there will be plenty of microbial life to get you started.
microgrowery,3cd311,H0FFM4N,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:41:27 2015 UTC,If you have been using synthetics in your soil it will make it very difficult for microbial life to live/reproduce. If you do start brewing teas you need to be very cautious of temp/time depending on what you are trying to achive. Also important to remeber most teas are not meant for feeding plant so you will need to supplement from time to time

(I did this because I was showing strong N deficiencies the first few weeks after 12/12 switch on my last few grows with this strain) The PPMs are a little higher than I normally go @620 and I'm beginning to see signs of burn on a few of the tips of lower leaves.

microgrowery,3cbywm,krymz1n,2,Mon Jul 6 18:52:20 2015 UTC,Ideally for a perpetual grow you need a minimum of 2 seperate areas.  A veg area and a flower area.  One can veg a plant for a long time but once flower begins the end is in sIght.  Maintaining the health of the veggers is essential as one wants healthy flowers.  The more light the better in each.  Veggers can be cut back while the flowers are finishing.   I clone off a vegger a week before transfering to flower.  The more light the happier the plant.

microgrowery,3cbywm,JBird99,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:28:01 2015 UTC,"How many clones do you want? I've seen 12 clones root under a single 9 Watt CFL. I'm sure you could root even more, just they won't do much in terms of growth under a 9w after they root. Growth will be pretty much stalled from how weak the light is, which may be perfect for you to wait until your flowering box is empty. Clones can be kept alive for weeks with just water and a weak light. Once the lower leaves on the clones begin to yellow, it's time for a bit of nutrients, and they will carry on happily for another few weeks."

microgrowery,3caws6,m3owjd,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:43:31 2015 UTC,"general rule of thumb is you want to flush with at least as much water as the size of your pot (so 5 gallons of water for a 5 gallon pot). I've read in a few places that some people like to use 2-3x the size of your pot, but personally I find this excessive. The idea is a sort of system re-boot, it helps a lot with nutrient lock out and pH issues. I wouldn't worry too much about continually checking the runoff pH while flushing.. the real test will be a few days after the flush when the plants are back under normal conditions. Just flush with the correct input pH for your medium and it should take care of itself."

Can say Attitude seems a bit slower in shipping compared to people having described their order from other places like Herbies. But that's about the only downside I've ever seen.  All my orders arrived with no mistakes or anything.  Nothing ever got seized at customs. Got plenty of freebies  - some of which were good others seem like junk ... but its free so whatever.  If you're really interested in getting the most value for your order i'd have to suggest you save up some funds and try to place a slightly larger order - even better if you can swing it when one of the sites are having a sale. For instance attitude does monthly promos and a few larger deals during the year (xmas and 420 I think?).  You get pretty crappy rates when you order only 1 or 3 seeds at a time especially when you include the shipping cost (I always paid extra for stealth shipping).   If you get a couple larger packs 5 or 6 seed packs the price will be more but then you generally qualify for more freebie seeds so in the end you can end with with a better seeds/dollar ratio. It never made sense to me to only try and order 3 seeds for $20 or whatever it'd be but then pay like another $30 in shipping costs.  But fi you need the seeds ASAP then either attitude or herbies is probably about the same cost - herbies maybe a bit cheaper

microgrowery,3c9kw5,spacebucketquestion,2,Mon Jul 6 16:52:53 2015 UTC,Ah. Interesting. Try perlite then. It's white so it reflects a lot of light. And it's porous so it holds air.
microgrowery,3c9kw5,minimicrotinygrower,2,Mon Jul 6 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"I've put a lot of perlite in my soil, already (about 15 cubic feet). I'm sure more on top would help as well. Thanks for the advice, sir."
microgrowery,3c9kw5,PunchinPriests,2,Mon Jul 6 17:20:23 2015 UTC,"Oh you did? That's why it dries out man. You gotta put moisture retaining stuff in there. Perlite is basically air. Try vermiculite or Peet Moss I think. You could also increase air flow somehow, either artificially or by removing obstacles to natural airflow, to decrease the effect the heat has. Just yesterday, I trimmed the hell out of a tree to get more light and air."

Purpling of the plant could look like this. The latter is usually due to cold temps, phosphorous deficiency (often cause by cold temps or too much nitrogen) or just something the strain does.  Closer pictures would help a lot!"
microgrowery,3c8hur,FatZombieMama,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:35:51 2015 UTC,Hey mate sorry for the wait. Here's an album of 3 pictures of it.   http://imgur.com/a/wPOKA  That's the closest I could get. I just sprayed the plants with a mix of 1 liter water and 5 ml of dawn dish soap just on this one plant. It doesn't seem damaged. Just black and weird.
microgrowery,3c8hur,FatZombieMama,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:49:21 2015 UTC,"Here's a better one of the inside of the stems. http://imgur.com/t1IH24w you can probably see by the pictures it's on the stem going up to the main cola as well. When I look closely at it, I'm not seeing anything small in there moving and based on the pictures I've been looking at of aphids, they'd be pretty easy to see."
microgrowery,3c8hur,FatZombieMama,2,Mon Jul 6 14:53:36 2015 UTC,"Still hard to tell.. some bugs can be microscopic - and hard to find even with a microscope! I'd run a few tests. First off, the color is either coming from something on the outside of the plants or is in the plant itself. Let's try to find out.   I would wash those areas really thoroughly with a hard spray of clean water. Not enough to damage them, but close. A GOOD HARD wash. Put a fan or something on them after so they dry quickly - I have actually dabbed mine dry with toilet paper when I can't get a fan over to them. Before and after pics can help identify if it helped at all.  If you have bugs or mold, the color should go away in places after the wash. If it doesn't, then it's something causing the plant to change colors. It can be too much water, cold temperatures, some deficiency.. but let's try this one first and see if anything can be ruled out."
microgrowery,3c8hur,FatZombieMama,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:31:35 2015 UTC,I used a garden spray bottle to spray my mix of soap and water. Is this enough?
microgrowery,3c8hur,waffleisland,2,Mon Jul 6 16:54:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe - if it's a really strong spray so that anything on the plant gets knocked off.  From your pictures, it SEEMS like there is something going on inside your plant. Personally, I would cut off the affected part in case it could spread. Then do some dissection and see what it looks like inside. It could be a worm that got in there, a mold or blight or something.. I've honestly never seen symptoms like these and would be interested to find out too. It's almost like ink got into that node and has been spreading into the stem and leaves.  I wouldn't risk it spreading. Most growers have to chop and cry at some point, this one may be yours."

microgrowery,3c7sp0,schwammerlklauber,5,Sun Jul 5 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"I've been gardening my whole life. I've read literally hundreds of gardening books, and have grown almost any flower, herb, or vegetable you can think of, but none of those books ever told me to deprive fruiting and flowering plants their most critical nutrients at the most crucial time of their lives: right as the flowers fully mature and ripen.  Even the stuff we all learned in elementary school or junior high school about osmosis is enough science to understand that flushing could not possibly work to cleanse immobile elements from a plant.  Literally no other plant growing guide for any species of plant on earth suggests that flushing is beneficial for the growth and development of a flowering plant. But without any valid scientific justification, this practice is considered to be the Gospel around here.  And yet, sometimes, I think I'm the only one here questioning this and asking for someone to provide solid evidence that flushing is anything more than stoner lore that goes against pretty much everything man has learned about agriculture since the last ice age.  If flushing was really the best thing, then we would all be washing the soil from our roots and placing our plants in distilled water for the last 2 weeks of their lives. That would truly be a ""flush"".  I do wish that someone had"
microgrowery,3c7sp0,ModernDayNeanderthal,3,Sun Jul 5 21:54:49 2015 UTC,"no idea if this is true, but thats the best explanation i found:  Myth #4 “Flushing plants with plain water removes chemicals.”  Flushing your plants in the last two weeks of a grow is one the most common pieces of knowledge when it comes to pre-harvest time.  So is flushing your plants before harvest a good idea? Yes. But not for the reason that most people think…  Any time you feed your plants, they intake nutrients which - in too-high amounts - are not able to be used by the plants and therefore can add a 'chemically' taste to your buds. Flushing in the last two weeks gives your plant a chance to “drink water” without extra minerals to further alter the taste. It also clears out any build up of excess minerals or nutrient salts in your medium (such as coco coir, or water for DWC).  However, flushing does not ""leach out"" nutrients/minerals that are already in the buds. While your plant can use up extra stored nutrients in the leaves of the plant, this does not remove a ""chemical"" taste from your buds if you've provided too many nutrients throughout the flowering stage.  Many people believe that flushing with plain water takes nutrients (and thus bad taste) out of the buds, in a sense, returning them to their ‘natural flavor’. Unfortunately, this just isn’t the case.  When it comes to ensuring good taste and smell of your cannabis plants, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Instead of relying on the flush to prevent extra nutrients from being stored in your buds, it's better to avoid ever giving the plant more nutrients than it can use in the first place. That means keeping nutrient levels as low as you can throughout the grow while preventing nutrient deficiencies.  source: http://www.growweedeasy.com/top-7-most-common-growing-myths"

microgrowery,3c81xu,574X,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:09:13 2015 UTC,"You should focus on growing one type of plant correctly instead of trying to handle multiple when you already said other attempts have gone poorly. You don't want to risk loosing what you put into nutrients and electricity. Your best bet is knowing your genetics and giving them the right conditions.   You say you're in a medical state, you could even buy clones. Every plant will be genetically identical, allowing ease of care and a uniform bag at the end. You can ensure you have quality genetics that have gotten other's results. They have been selected from seeds as elite genetics. You can even get tips on growing them. Just make sure you treat them before introducing them to the space.  The idea with seeds is you clone them all, and based on results of each plant you keed the best clone as a mother. There can be a lot of genetic variation in the seeds."
microgrowery,3c81xu,574X,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:14:20 2015 UTC,"Didn't say it went poorly, just I approached it poorly, also we knew a lot less about cultivation at that point in time.  I definitely understand what your saying about getting my time and money's worth though, and the easy of working with a uniform crop.  However, even with seedbank seeds I was hoping to grow a variety of strains; I don't have the space to cycle several crops, and wanted to give myself some options.  I guess I'll need to research some strains that are easy to grow under similar conditions, and go from there.  Clones aren't a particularly viable option.  Very few clubs/dispensaries deal with clones, selection can be limited, and they still tend to be fairly pricy for good genetics.  Maybe after I get a couple grows under my belt.

microgrowery,3c81xu,krymz1n,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:35:02 2015 UTC,"If you want variety pick a couple of different plants, don't grow 9 different things. You'll have to check each one to figure out when to chop, you'll be treating a bunch of deficiencies because everything will have slightly different needs at certain parts of it's life cycle, and your whole space will have different height plants. Light intensity from indoor lights diminishes at a geometric rate. If you keep your light at 6 inches from the tallest plant, and its a foot taller than the shortest plant, the short tops will recieve 1/9 of the light. That's not even accounting for shading from taller plants. You want an even dense canopy and a dialed in nutrient system.  If good clones are expensive then just buy one or two and veg out mothers. You could scrog them in the space and take cuttings of less important branches before you flip them. It would probably be cheaper than seeds too.  You can grow dank the first try."

microgrowery,3c6yr8,PirateCrew5000,2,Sun Jul 5 13:09:59 2015 UTC,humidity is low and temp is high. There is no way you can grow in those conditions. You need to get the temps down right away for sure. You can look online for humidity charts that show what it should be based on your temperature.

They just grow naturally for self preservation and try to pass on their genetics. I thought that flushing was mainly to leech out extra nutrients that the plant would need/like but you don't need it in your smoke because it can interfere with smoothness of burning and taste bitter. Perhaps if the plant knew it was going to be smoked it might do you a solid and stop the uptake of nutrients towards the end of its life cycle.  ;)  just a thought, I'm not trying to be a dick"

Lift the pot to see if it needs water but you can probably go a week between watering. Just make sure the environment is the best you can provide and it will reward you.
microgrowery,3c4u1j,Forestfriendly,16,Sat Jul 4 20:12:29 2015 UTC,"Lumens are for humans. Lumens measure the amount of visible light to the human eye. For measuring light available to plants we need to look at the PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) rating.  Really we should be looking at ""Par Watts per square meter"". So this is making sure we have a spectrum visible to the plants and strong enough that they will thrive.  Using time released fertilizers gives the grower little to no control over the available nutrients to the plants  For example, most growers like to drastically reduce the nitrogen during the full flower period. If your soil is continuously releasing N throughout the grow it would be impossible to cut it back.   Also it is easy to build up excess nutrient salts around the root zone with time released fertilizers and will throw off your ph and desired nutrient ratios.  For example, if your soil keeps releasing more potassium than the plant can take up it may go from 3-1-4 to 3-1-7. The potassium can interfere with calcium uptake and lead to lockouts etc Then the soil ph starts to rise because calcium is building up etc."

AT ace and kmart I've seen full spectrum tube lights(florescent) like this. I never see people on here using these kind, are they bad for cannabis? Or are the other recommended lights just a way better choice?"
microgrowery,3c4u1j,greenmtnherbalist,5,Sat Jul 4 20:44:05 2015 UTC,"Supposedly full spectrum lights should cover the spectrum available to plants. But most people using those style fluorescent lights go with bulbs in the 3000k spectrum for flower and the 5600k spectrum for veg. You could use a combination of both and make your own 'full spectrum'.  Those particular bulbs in the link would not be great though because they look like 'T8' bulbs, you need the 'T5' for those style fluorescent lights.  T5 fluorescent lights will do okay for flowering but are actually really great for the vegetative stage and keeping mother plants happy.  happy growing."

microgrowery,3c4u1j,LEGALinSCCCA,2,Sat Jul 4 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"I can answer the soil question. It's because 'slow release' soils can cause nutrient burn, whereby the plant has too much of one or more nutes. It also causes problems with feeding nutes. When do you start? You have no idea when those nutrients are used up. And it takes longer than it does for one grow.   You ""can"" grow in any media, but some are easier or more or less recommended. Time release soil is highly not recommended."

microgrowery,3c4u1j,Justforpot,2,Sat Jul 4 20:45:30 2015 UTC,Different bulbs and lights will have different lumen output. Hps and MH have high outputs as high as 150k lumens. T5 fixtures have relatively low lumen output compared to hps and MH. But what's important is that they draw power at almost a linear amount. The higher the lumen output the the higher the wattage draw. Now the new tech is LED which actually has a higher lumen output for the wattage required over older technology. This means you can grow with comparable light intensity but use less power.

microgrowery,3c5biz,AfricanTokingDrum,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:01:44 2015 UTC,"300-500 is a really really small budget if you expect quality. With that said the easiest cheapest route to go is a bat wing 600 or 1000 hps and magnetic ballast. Get a carbon filter and fan, smart pots and fox farm soil. You need a ph test kit and get basic nutes like flouro duo. Get ph down and make sure it's 6.5. And you're going to need the dehumidifier for sure to keep it around 50% unless you can vent the area very well. With your skills I would build a ""clean"" room inside that area of which it will contain the light and allow you to control the environment a lot better. Or you can just buy a tent. Another note, I wouldn't split anything with your friend unless he is putting his ass on the line with you. Considering its your house you should reap the reward of the risk. If he wants some then sell it to him. A 4x6 area will be perfect. You can grow a pound or more easily with this setup in 4 months."

microgrowery,3c5biz,Justforpot,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:05:49 2015 UTC,Hps will add heat and soil should minimize humidity though between soil and hydro I bet the difference is very small. Hydro flood and drain I've found to be the easiest and most effective form of hydro but it costs more to start and is less forgiving than soil. There's no buffer with hydro so you can mess them up very quickly. Soil is very easy and you can go days without even looking at them.

If I find the source a bit later I will try and leave a link. also because you are lollipopping that should rectify the problem as after the 2 ft mark most of your plant will he bare and all light will be focused on the top part of the plant."

This is not a permanent change as the water coming back to temperature would fix the problem. orrr unfix your problem potentially.

microgrowery,3c4dyk,Vintage_Loat,3,Sat Jul 4 17:46:45 2015 UTC,"wayyyyy too hot and perhaps a bit of nute burn. In no circumstances should your temps go above 36 degrees celcius/97 degrees farenhieght, unless you are supplementng C02 at large amounts/ strain has some sort of high temp requirements"
microgrowery,3c4dyk,TheProphecer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:58:22 2015 UTC,"I thought it was too many nutrients at first and dialed it way back, but it persisted so thinking it was heat. I live in so cal though so its over 97f the majority of days. I'll move it to a cooler area, can I expect to see it get better or would it be better to cut off the dead portions?"
microgrowery,3c4dyk,nastdrummer,2,Sat Jul 4 18:23:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mess with it. By removing the dead portions you are opening a wound, think of the burnt portion as a scab, if you tear it off all you are doing is exposing raw fresh tissue to potential damage.  Anytime the temps get over 90* the plant will suffer. I am in NorCal and been having a hell of a time this last week with temps varying from 105-111. I use a trellis to shade them anytime the temp reaches 90*. They have been tolerating the temps pretty well."
microgrowery,3c4dyk,sauceLegs,2,Sat Jul 4 19:13:49 2015 UTC,"This is solid advice. If the plant can recoup, it will naturally shed the dead bits like we shed dead skin."
microgrowery,3c4dyk,Doormancer,2,Sat Jul 4 21:00:40 2015 UTC,"Heat can do some damage. In my experience, it's better to cut off the damage, as it will be generally unproductive but still draw resources from the plant."

microgrowery,3c4ad6,call_me_gunner,7,Sat Jul 4 17:13:46 2015 UTC,Put it in the ground
microgrowery,3c4ad6,dudechilll,5,Sat Jul 4 17:21:48 2015 UTC,"Don't expect to get good yields or potent buds if you are not spending time, effort, and money to create the perfect environment for the plants to grow in. Its as easy as throwing the seed and forgetting or as complicated as measuring CO2 and lumen levels."
microgrowery,3c4ad6,NecroticFury,9,Sat Jul 4 17:29:37 2015 UTC,"you will need a few things.  1: a small enclosed cupboard /closet or a large box you can grow in. It  needs to be at least 1 foot by 2 foot really if you're going to get anything.  2: Some lights. You can use everyday household lights, the CFL kind work well. Or you can go spend $50 on ebay for a cheap LED light. Spending money on a nice light will get you at least 5x more in bud.  3: A pot of nice dirt. 1 per plant. Prefereably moist soil with lots of lovely compost. You can get soil mix that has fertilizer in it already, but that costs money. Weed likes high potassium, FYI.  4: Some method of collecting rainwater  5: a timer that automatically turns power on and off and a fan.  Pop all of your seeds into some lukewarm water in the dark for 24 hours. I use a rubber ice cube tray as I think it keeps the water warm for longer.  While they are soaking get your pot ready. You simply place a few large rocks or stones into the bottom of the pot, then fill the rest up with your nice dirt.  After they are soaked they will swell up and may pop out the beginning of a tiny white shoot. They are ready to plant. Just pop them in the soil about 1 inch down. Make sure the soil is damp and warm, around 20C is good. Try to plant with the white shoot side facing up or sideways.  So just leave the pot somewhere warm with light, and in about a day or two a little tiny shoot with 2 leaves should poke out of the soil.  Get the pot into your box and under the light. Ideally the light or lights should be directly above the plants.   If you use CFL, you can get away with just a small desk fan or large PC fan blowing air around, you don't need to worry too much about ventilation other than to make sure air has some way of entering and leaving your box or closet. Holes would do the job.  If you use Halogen or some other hot light, or even a cheap Chinese LED grow light, you will need to make sure you ventilate the box so that there is a fan sucking out and a fan blowing in.  Once the leaves show up then the lights need to be on, and controlled by the timer. All you do is set it so that it's on 16 hours and off 8 hours.  Then just leave it alone until it puts roots down. It's important that it doesn't move at this stage. Any small vibrations can break the tiny root hairs that it's putting out. After a couple of days, start to water the soil with the rainwater.  Watering is pretty easy, but you need to remember to do it like clockwork. Basically the rule is you water until the soil is completely soaked and water starts leaking out of the bottom of the pot. You then leave it until the soil on top is very dry to the touch, and if you dig down an inch or two it's still dry, before you water again. At first, this will take a good few days for it to get this dry. As the plant grows bigger it will need water more and more frequently.  Always use rainwater, never tap water. Unless you add nutrients to tap water which cost money, then it isn't really going to help. Rain water should have everything your plants need in it more or less. They won't be winning any biggest bud of the year competitions unless you feed them nutes specifically designed for growing weed, but beggars can't be choosers. Toward the end each plant will be drinking 10 or more litres per week, and this is when they will need the good stuff in rainwater the most, so make sure you collect enough.  Then wait. Around 4 weeks will pass and if you water whenever the plants need it, they should grow nice and big. It's a good idea to put some rainwater in a garden spray bottle and spray them every day. The more the better. Be careful with that if you're using standard lightbulbs however.  If you find the leaves start touching each other, then pluck them back. There's no point having two leaves which push into one another competing for space in your small growing area. Whenever you see this happen, just choose one of the two and pluck it off at the base.  About 8 weeks in you should be able to tell if any of your plants are male. Look it up on google how to tell the difference. Only female plants are worth smoking, and male plants cause females to produce seeds, which reduce the potency of your product (sorry to say that if you found the seeds in your pick up, you paid for garbage).  If you are unlucky enough to get a male plant, tear it out and throw it away. If all your plants turn out male, tough luck kid.  Around the 8 week mark, or maybe 6 weeks if you bought a bright light, you should ""flip"" your plants.  All this means is changing the timer from 16 hours on 8 hours off to 12 hours on 12 hours off. You also need to make sure no light can get into the box /closet during the dark period. This isn't really important before flipping to flower, during veg the plants can get as much light as you can provide, and they don't really mind being woken up in the middle of the night, but once you flip to flower then no light during dark period, and I mean NO light. If the plant gets any light at all during its dark period in flower, even for a few minutes, then it's likely to ruin your weed or at the very least stunt the growth. I'll leave that to you to figure out, but Duck tape is your friend.  And that's kind of it. Keep watering, keep spraying and eventually you will get lovely bud. Pay attention to the white flowers when they appear, and don't let any fan leaves block out the light getting to them. Feeding nutes obviously bumps up the yield, as does paying attention to the soil pH and regulating it with additives, but all of that costs money, and you asked for free.   Apart from a $5 desk fan and a $5 power timer, this is about as free as you can get."

What you can do is cut the plants at the base and harvest like normal. Then take the large leaves, stems and any other green waste and chop it down to fit into paper grocery bags. With the soil and root balls you can put into heavy duty black trash bags, I then drop those bags on the ground a few times to break up the container shapes and mix the soil together. With the trash bags of soil and paper grocery bags of green waste I will take them to an unsecured dumpster that doesn't have cameras on or in the parking lot and ditch the green waste then move on to another dumpster and drop the soil. Have the dumpsters and route scouted out. Go early mornings before work starts at said locations this will minimize interactions with anyone including the cops. And make sure you have a reason to be where you are going. Keep the trash in the trunk. Don't speed, have anything wrong at all with your car or do anything stupid while riding dirty and you will be fine."

This is probably from a combination of the root bound nature of the plant, the fact that you have only fed twice after 50 days of veg, and possibly lockout due to pH if you are not checking the pH of your feedings. Where you go from here depends on what medium you are transplanting into. It needs food and a bigger pot asap. Good Luck!"

microgrowery,3c1r57,cdnj,2,Fri Jul 3 23:51:14 2015 UTC,Sour diesel seed. Day 49 veg. It's not that big because it's still in a one gallon smart pot. I was told to right these issues before transplanting.   Under one 300W (180 true) MarsHydro LED. Last water PH out was 6.27. Been using mostly distiller with some calmag mixed in. Only used FF nutes twice  I have been letting the soil dry out very well in between waterings so it shouldn't be over watering.   35% FFOF 35% OF 30% perlite. On 18/6 temps 77-85 RH 38-48% good ventilation  I really want to transplant this thing soon so any advice is much appreciated. If I forgot anything just ask. Thanks
microgrowery,3c1r57,JohnCri,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:30:58 2015 UTC,My plants do 30 days roughly in a 1 gallon pot before being upgraded to a true 5 gallon.  The roots need the space. Helps with having to water less in a larger pot.  Add root microbe enhancement such as Microryzae Root Enhancement
microgrowery,3c1r57,6trees1pot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:23:24 2015 UTC,Do you check the ph of what you are adding?  Most problems with uptake of nutrients are ph related.  I take issue with smart pots with their inability to keep the soil flushed.  There are no drain holes And even though water leeches through the fabric its not fast enough to run through for me.  The symptoms of under watering are very close to over watering.  I also notice when i grew in small pots pronounced yellowing when its way past time for transplanting.  Feeding rootbound plants is futile.  Good luck.

microgrowery,3c1wmy,IamMatthewOk,5,Sat Jul 4 03:43:55 2015 UTC,"you should always have a run off man. usually, you want to take the run off water and that's where you can calculate what your plant is taking up and how much its spitting out. Not sure if you have a pH and ppm meter, but next time you do, water a plant until you see about 10-20% run off. Try to collect this run off into a dish,cup,etc so you can take your readings from there. As mentioned above, from here you'll be able to adjust.   Now if you don't have those things, you should still be watering until you get a lil run off so that you're ensuring everything that was built up in the soil can be replaced by fresh goodness. Grab some saucers for your pots if you're doing soil ( i think you are...) and this will collect the water. This also allows the roots that have reached the bottom of the pot to drink water!   https://www.youtube.com/user/Just4Growers/videos?view=0&sort=dd&shelf_id=0  Good stuff"

The bursting bubbles should still reach it from there. Also, when you don't have significant roots, some topfeeding will help. It's just my personal preference to wait until roots are showing, but I've seen journals from growers who germinate their seeds directly in the cubes and stick them straight into the buckets with success. In terms of starting nutes, wait until the cotyledons are starting to yellow a little bit. They provide the seedling with food at the start of life, but once they start to yellow out they are almost depleted and you can start feeding. Always start with 1/4 strength to start and increase from there. Pay close attention to your PPM and the plant will tell you if she needs more, less or the same amount of nutes."

Fogponics for a whole grow does not work well though. I ran into two main problems which were the fogger vibrating disk heats the water - as hot as low 90s (f) when my cabinet air temp was low 70s.   Also nutrient deficiency came into play after about 4 weeks of veg. Many people theorize that the fog water droplets are too small to hold all the nutrients that are  in the reservoir basin. Compared to areoponics where its a fine spray mist out of a pressurized line. Advantage of fogponics though is unless yourpumping the fogged air in from a remote reservoir, you have a dwc hydro setup below the main roots so if something fails your plant wont die in a few hours, unlike areoponics  But hey, vibrating fogger disks are cheap on ebay, try it out for youself and see what works and what doesn't.

I had left the bottom 50% of the fan leaves alone, which I stopped the trim at the node (or one below) where I discovered the aphids.  Yesterday's pruning was the rest of those bottom leaves as a part of the lollipopping process, save the small ones that are still in the back.  I would have left my beautiful canopy alone, had I not had the pest problem, but I took a ""you can have the leaves, but the buds are mine"" approach to the plant, and the aphids managed to not touch the buds at all. Three weeks from harvest was when I discovered it, so I took the dish soap/water 7 day spray approach and I haven't seen a bug since.  I still don't understand how the infestation even happened.

If you aren't planting into it immediately keep watering it with a cover crop to keep the soil microbial life alive and working.  http://forum.grasscity.com/organic-growing/1299862-no-till-gardening.html  that thread will teach you everything you want to know about no-till cannabis gardening from coot himself."

microgrowery,3bzvmq,dudechilll,2,Fri Jul 3 16:58:18 2015 UTC,I read about 15 pages of some guys grow log when he was trying out all of the major lines of nutrients and came to find earth juice worked best for him. I still ended up going with the ff trio and solubles because everyone says good things about them. Im using bloombastic and bud candy as well so we'll see how they do.

I'm only on 13F so i still have about 8 days before i'll start it but i also heard you pretty much notice differences overnight. Did you grab it from a hydro store or somewhere reputable? Ive heard of people claiming amazon waters it down or something.
microgrowery,3bzvmq,003n1gm400,2,Fri Jul 3 19:33:52 2015 UTC,"Well the first bottle I got was from a local hydro store. It was in a beat up bottle so the guy threw in some roottastic. The bloombastic was sealed in but when I opened it, it was chunky and dried out. So I ordered some off Amazon and it came out looking like how I would expect it (green slime).

microgrowery,3bzvmq,ThatsMrDorkToYou,2,Fri Jul 3 22:07:10 2015 UTC,"There are side by side trials all over the various forums. ""X vs Y"" kinda stuff. But these are all kinda sketchy, as the grower usually favors one variety, and may not be using the nutes properly, or to their full potential.  Most of the cannabis tailored nutes are good enough to raise your plants. Its really about taking those 3part mixes, or 1part+additives, and giving your plant what it wants and needs. Nutrient requirements are similar, but also vary from strain, environment, medium etc.  Just cuz some bro claims 2gpw with X nutrients, doesn't mean that your results will be the same.   Get a solid nutrient supply. Learn your plants. Dial that shit in!"
microgrowery,3bzvmq,grodadro,2,Fri Jul 3 17:36:20 2015 UTC,Aside from a few macro ingredients plant require essentially N-P-K and O. These are elements on the periodic table. There is no distinction between organic and mineral. Some of my best results have been from hydroponics using inexpensive GH maxi (grow and bloom) used at half of recommended strength which I believe allows more dissolved oxygen in the nutrient soda which promotes unbelievable growth.

Check out the ingredients, what they're derived from, and their percentages and you'll find that there really isn't much variation between lines of nutrients (and even different nutrients within the same line!).   So many new products have fancy packaging, catchy names, and buzz words littering their descriptions.... but it's the same shit that's been on the market for years.   There are one million and one ways to grow pot. Choose what sits easiest on your conscience, easiest with your time schedule, and easiest with your checkbook.

microgrowery,3c2nwp,I_am_jacks_reddit,2,Sat Jul 4 04:52:12 2015 UTC,Depends on what it's planted in. Drop a clone in hydroton without nutes and it will be dead pretty quick. Plant it in high quality soil and you could probably flower it out with nothing but water. But I would expect the flowering to not be very good if you do that.
microgrowery,3c2nwp,Justforpot,2,Sat Jul 4 05:46:55 2015 UTC,Again out of nothing but curiosity I'm using FFOF I believe that has some nutes in it already.

They all developed really bad deficiencies, lost all their leaves halfway through flower, and died.  The spider mite infestation probably didn't help either.  So, yeah, FFOF doesn't really have enough nutes to carry a plant all the way through flower.   I understand that you're just asking about this because you're curious but, if this has sparked your interest in growing without nutes, there are some supersoil recipes that might allow you to do that.  It's something that I've been wanting to try for a while now."

microgrowery,3c2nwp,Justforpot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:33:02 2015 UTC,Nutes that have synthetic salts or high levels of chelating organic acids will kill them.  Better to just cut your soil with  1/3 castings and 1/3 little perlite.
microgrowery,3c2nwp,Justforpot,1 point,Sat Jul 4 20:04:20 2015 UTC,It does. I'd use plain water until flower then go half nutes and see how it likes it.

Two of them are in 3 gallon pots and the other is in the ground in my vegetable garden. I've been feeding the two in pots nutrients and letting the one in the garden go on just water.  The two in the pots are currently in week 2 (roughly) of flowering and are almost 2 feet in height. The one in the garden is about a foot tall so roughly half the height. This is just eyeballing it.   The soil composition is different between the pots and garden but the actual vegetables growing are pretty tall so I feel confident in attributing the grow rate mostly on nutrients or lack thereof.   Edit: just for added information, all water for all three plants goes in with a ph of 6.4. The nutrients I'm using is GH Flora series on the Lucas formula for the two plants."

microgrowery,3c0f8m,Sofakingcoolstorybro,5,Fri Jul 3 21:19:57 2015 UTC,As someone who started growing like this about 3 years ago I've seen my stock strengthen. But more importantly it opens up the canopy and gives you a bigger radius in your plant if you grow it properly. Those little branches that you might end up cutting or dying will instead start to reach for the light and and it's own branch will start to produce it's own nodes. I should mention that I also super crop certain branches to open the top. You can see some of the plants I've submitted. Hope this helps. Cheers!

Botrytis has no soluble toxins (or insoluble toxins) and has a particle size in the 10-100 micron range, you can completely remove it with a simple filtration.

Sometimes I think we make this way more complicated than it needs to be. No other flower or vegetable requires daily pH adjustment for its biweekly prescription nutrients that change from day to day.   I'm leaning more and more towards providing most nutrients from organic soil amendments and using the bottles only as supplements to ensure no deficiencies. I've also completely stopped defoliating any of the understory fan leaves. I just pinch off the tips of growing shoots to minimize lower bud production. In short, to grow much more like my organic community garden plots than like a mad scientist in a lab (been there, done that)."

microgrowery,3bvvil,Accerbus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:44:34 2015 UTC,They do if you're growing hydroponically. The point of soil is to build a system within to keep you from having to add nutes. If you have to use bottle fertilizer then you probably didn't mix your soil right. It's like finding the exact ppm ranges and nutes for hydro. Different beast.

microgrowery,3bzhfn,waxhive,2,Fri Jul 3 13:07:23 2015 UTC,I've seen people recommend reducing the light/slightly shorten the light schedule to trick the plant into thinking its life cycle is ending.

microgrowery,3bym1u,quickaeroponics,2,Fri Jul 3 08:06:15 2015 UTC,"1000W Wall draw per 4x4 or 16 square feet approximately.  In your case that makes 2000W wall draw in total.  Right now your wall draw is probably...  less than 900W.  I'd add at least a 1000W HPS under that assumption.  Or if money wasn't an object perhaps 2x 600W Led panels.    You're likely going to want more exhaust fan than a 6"" at your tent volume.  You have 208 cubic feet to vent, and will want to vent that 2-3 times a minute.  That means you'll need about 600CFM of exhaust fan.  Most 6"" fans will not achieve that."

microgrowery,3bxiqp,6trees1pot,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:12:49 2015 UTC,Its certainly not going to hurt the plant for some very light training.  You should be cautious to not do anything that might slow it down.  The only way to find out what your plant will take is experimentation.

Most people on their first grow don't see .5 grams per watt.  1 gram per watt is typically considered a good yield and while some people get the occasional higher yield per watt its not typical, and not usually their average yield.  In a 5x5 space you will be able to utilize roughly 1200W of lighting.  And with the germination -> Veg -> Flower times you'll have I'd expect at most about a LB per cycle at an average cycle length of 3-4 months."

microgrowery,3bw8me,quickaeroponics,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:16:23 2015 UTC,Ok and how long does that go on for and what humidity percentage are we talking about? I can usually keep my tent around 60% without too much trouble.
microgrowery,3bw8me,quickaeroponics,2,Thu Jul 2 18:20:19 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess I simplified a bit.    1) Take your cutting from a plant that is about 4 weeks old (has about 5-6 nodes on it)  2) Use a clean sharp tool, sterilize the edge of it with rubbing alcohol and then make a cut at a 45 degree angle.  This cut should be a green branch, low on the plant, that has 2 or 3 nodes itself.  Make sure the cut is about 1/4 an inch below the node.  3) I strongly suggest using rooting gel/powder as it helps to speed up the process and increase chances of success.  4) You place the cuttings into your growing medium, most people use rockwool or rooting plugs, but you can also use dixie cups or a cloner, or whatever.  5) Keep the humidity as high as you can, 60 is okay, 80 would be better.  (Though this is just for the cloning/germination period, you'll want to bring that down into veg/flower).  It takes a few days to a week or so depending on the health of the clone, mother and the quality of the environment.  You can usually tell when they can be transplanted by identifying root growth.  A couple inches of roots is ample."
microgrowery,3bw8me,ThatsMrDorkToYou,2,Thu Jul 2 18:45:16 2015 UTC,"If you are buying rooted clones, throw em in the net pot and let em go. Feed as your nutrient line recommends for cuttings, and go from there."

microgrowery,3bxkwj,fanarc,2,Fri Jul 3 00:01:23 2015 UTC,"I would think it depended most on the lights you're planning to use. I own the Mars II Hydro 900, which is square, so it perfectly fits my square tent. Some lights are rectangular is shape, so they better suit a rectangular tent. Another thing to consider is that the 2x4 tent will only accommodate plants in single file, which makes tending to them a bit easier, as you don't have to reach over or under another one in front of it. With the 3x3, there is a good chance you'll be stacking plants behind each other. I guess it depends how you're going to grow, but a few things to think about."
microgrowery,3bxkwj,Goats22,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:40:55 2015 UTC,"Definitely like the idea of having everything nice and accessible in the 4x2, but worried it might waste some growing space in the corners, or be harder to light evenly.  Sadly this closet has a bulkhead for an airduct, so the majority is just below 6', otherwise I'd get a 4x3x6.  I was strongly considering mars-hydro fixtures. Want to go with LED because we already have quite warm summers and want to keep cooling/lighting costs lower with a smaller grow.  Looked at all the options and boiled it down to mars, platinum or BML, but don't want to spend an arm and a leg, hence mars.    Haven't bought panels yet, so my options are wide open.  Was thinking either a Mars II 900 or 192x3w reflector for a 3x3 tent, and two Mars II 400s or two 96x3w reflectors for a 2x4, but open for ideas."
microgrowery,3bxkwj,Goats22,2,Fri Jul 3 02:26:14 2015 UTC,"Well, the Mars 900 says the coverage is good for 4x4, so it should reach the corners. There are posts by others in this sub using 2x300w mars panels as well that have resulted in some great yields using similar space."

microgrowery,3bxkwj,X0dium,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:42:00 2015 UTC,Basically you are looking for 50 watts per sq. Ft. A Mars 900 will come in a little low in a 3x3 and a 1200 will come in a little higher. So really it's about preference. I just set up a 3x3 and I'm using 2 p300s. While I paid a little more for less watts I feel like the 5 year warranty was worth it. On top of the fact that I'm only running 200 watts in veg is saving me on an electric bill. Everyone has their own opinions on LEDs so take what we say with a grain of salt. Do some research and remember that ALL of these companies are out to make money.
microgrowery,3bxkwj,2moreweeks,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:22:07 2015 UTC,"I am really interested in the platinum fixtures, but the cost concerns me. Do you have any more details about your grow?  I don't see many true micro grows using mid range fixtures (BML strips, Platinums, etc).  The manufacturers claim significant gains for your money, but do I get close to double the par/yield for more than double the money?"
microgrowery,3bxkwj,overgrowthegovt,1 point,Fri Jul 3 05:13:08 2015 UTC,I am still on my first grow. So I can't really say if yields are better or worse. I can tell you that the company is always going to give you optimal setup readings and you have to remember that is not always going to be the case. I like the lights so far. I'm only about a week into veg and they are looking pretty.  Remember that 5 year warranty though as well as Mars is only offering a 1 year warranty. That really is going to make a big difference. The quality (build) of the light is great and they are super sturdy while not being super heavy. My Temps have never gone above 85 in my tent so there's that as well. I've also been monitoring my electric bill and it hasn't made a significant jump since I've started.

The cheaper version of this is a tent. Cover it with a couple tarps to keep sun out but make sure there's airflow. Light a fire upwind so heat (but hopefully not too much smoke) gets blown onto/into the tent. Then just camp out till it's ready to jar.  Old school growers dry in the shade all the time, there's obviously some quality loss but it works. Rough trim so you get even bud sizes, thow it on something in the shade on a hot day. The key is the hot day, which isnt always available around harvest time. This might also take more than one day.  Good luck Bud!"

microgrowery,3bvu8r,Dr-MantisTobogan,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:52:23 2015 UTC,How do you plan on keeping light out during flower   Huh?  There is no light that gets into the tent at all.......  thise are mesh vents built into the bottom of the tent and it spends 100% of its life in a dark garage.  Not sure what airflow has to do with light leaks...
microgrowery,3bvu8r,LazyGrower,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:56:40 2015 UTC,Cool.  Just checking since you said they were big holes.   Is your mesh very fine? Makes me worry about bugs
microgrowery,3bvu8r,ThatsMrDorkToYou,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:13:43 2015 UTC,Its a fine mesh.....but i stress the FUCK about about bugs....so i tapped some 220 micron silk screen over the mesh on the outside.  Aint nothin but air getting in/out of this tent. haha
microgrowery,3bvu8r,LazyGrower,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:15:04 2015 UTC,Noob Opinion: Keep sucking out the air. Gives them fresh air to breathe when new air comes in.   I stopped my fans this weekend to do work on the room and the plants got sad really fast because they didn't have their usual air circulation. And the room warmed up because of lack of airflow.  Edit: Temps where 107 last weekend.
microgrowery,3bvu8r,xcdc802,2,Thu Jul 2 16:04:14 2015 UTC,"That's no noobie opinion. You definitely want to keep air flowing in, out, and around.. 24/7.  Stale air is bad. Moisture builds really fast in an unvented grow. Temps rise. All great reasons to keep it running.  OP, you need some AC or something to battle that heat. Or at the minimum, consider venting the garage."

I agree with the lazygrower, air circulation and fresh air will be more important than hoping to trap some cool air. If things start getting hotter and money is tight you could make a redneck AC unit with a styrofoam cooler, a fan, and lots of ice."
microgrowery,3bvsl0,grikstein,3,Thu Jul 2 15:40:17 2015 UTC,"1000 watt is also more efficient, more lumens per watt than the 400."
microgrowery,3bvsl0,mikejones425,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:49:12 2015 UTC,Totally agree
microgrowery,3bvsl0,quickaeroponics,3,Thu Jul 2 19:03:31 2015 UTC,"For a 4x4 the 1000w will give you perfect coverage, the 2x 400W will actually have less coverage at ideal lumens/par than the 1000W for the same space.  Not by a huge amount mind you, but less.  I also think a single light setup is going to reduce your potential for failure.  On the other hand, it increases your loss in the case of a single unit failing.  Which is to say with the 1kw if your ballast/bulb dies your plants are lightless until you fix it.  With the 400s you get some redundancy and in the case of failure you could limp along on a single light.  If you keep the ambient temp of the room around 70 degrees, and properly       exhaust your air your temps should be fine regardless of which setup you go with.  If you can do that, then the value of LEDs is much lower for you and I wouldn't look at going that route.    All that babbling aside, I'd either go with the 1KW, or 2x 600W (not 2x 400W)."
microgrowery,3bvsl0,Mac_drevious,1 point,Thu Jul 2 18:23:40 2015 UTC,"I appreciate the thorough response,  you addressed all of the concerns I had. The lady at the shop suggested just doing away with the 400w's as well for the space i'm designing. And with cost being a factor, having additional ballasts and additional energy costs would only hurt me in the long run. I think the 1000w is looking like the answer at this point. Any suggestions on where I can get a solid ballast? I'm buying the bulbs from 1000bulbs, and I believe i can use the same hood I previously used for the 400w, correct?"
microgrowery,3bvsl0,quickaeroponics,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:08:40 2015 UTC,you just need the right ballast for the bulbs. so you'd have to buy a 1000W ballast
microgrowery,3bvsl0,Mac_drevious,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"I use an UNO ballast I got on Amazon (in a package, it included the bulb, hood and ballast, but you may be able to find a ballast and bulb kit).  It's pretty no frills but ample for the job and you can find them for about $100 if you look around a bit.    The thing you probably want to ask yourself is if it's worth shelling out a bit extra today for some nicer ballast features, such as being dimmable, having soft start features, or being compatible with multiple bulb types.  For example the Galaxy Grow Amps support 400W and 600W or 400W, 600W and 1000W depending on the model.  But you'll be spending 2-3x as much for one of these.  I carry and sell both, but I usually stick with the UNO and other entry level ballasts for beginners and let the Pro's decide they want the higher feature set of the nicer ballasts.  On the hood/reflector, the answer is a resounding, probably.  I'd have to see the hood, but most are interchangeable (some use different bulb types, and some use different power cords for example)."
microgrowery,3bvsl0,quickaeroponics,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:46:40 2015 UTC,i think size of the space plays a role in the decision too. if its a really long area like a walk in closet 2 lights would probably provide better light distribution. agree that 2 600W HIDs would probably be ideal for a good size grow space.  but for a good sized room you'd probably want at least 2 1000W HIDs
microgrowery,3bvsl0,Pigpen1204,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:28:40 2015 UTC,"Dimensions: 4x4x5   That lines up perfectly with a 1000W which is considered to be ideal for a 16 square foot space.  But yeah, a longer narrower 2x8 footprint and I would suggest using two lights over one.    2x 1KW lights would be most appropriate for a 4x8 footprint."
microgrowery,3bvsl0,ThatsMrDorkToYou,2,Thu Jul 2 20:32:06 2015 UTC,"1000w all day. Not only do you get more canopy covered, you'll get a better penetration of the light. That is, a 400w might penetrate 8 inches effectively into the canopy, the 1000w might penetrate 18"". You'll get thicker, denser buds with the 1000w."
microgrowery,3bvsl0,waxhive,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:54:11 2015 UTC,Thats something they mentioned as well concerning light penetration. Is lumens not the most important factor? because in theory if you have a 400w light + say a 600w light wouldn't it be producing the same amount of lumens in the same specified area?
microgrowery,3bvsl0,waxhive,2,Thu Jul 2 19:03:12 2015 UTC,"Personally would recommend taller for a 1k. 5' sounds tall but.. 12-18inches for pots, 6-8in for the hood, plus you need to keep light at least 12"" from canopy. That leaves you with 2' for plant growth. Yes you can LST, train, etc. 1k has great penetration, and can handle larger than a 2foot plant.  If you're building it, go for 7-8 feet. This may also help with the heat a bit.  If you're set on 5' go with 600 or some solid led."
microgrowery,3bvsl0,waxhive,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"I'd go LED and it's not even close.  Heat's not an issue at all then, less wattage required for same amount of buds since watts aren't the deciding factor of bud production in LED."
microgrowery,3bvsl0,LazyGrower,1 point,Thu Jul 2 17:40:02 2015 UTC,cost is to much of a factor for me to consider quality LED lights. I'm in a scenario where i have gotten a 400w kit from a friend. So its either give it back and buy a 1000w or add an additional light along side the light I already have.

microgrowery,3bvh56,xcdc802,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:31:00 2015 UTC,"I really suggest doing some more research first, but I'll answer your questions.  Typically growers stick to either a 18/6 or 24/0 light cycle during veg, 20/4 is more rare to hear of. You can veg your plant indefinitely if you maintain the light cycle. I've heard of mother plants being in veg for years.  You can start flowering whenever you like, although most people recommend waiting until the plant is a certain height or a certain age, you'll get different answers depending on who you ask. Depending on the strain, the plant will grow an additional 1/3 to 2/3 of it's height after you switch to flower. I wouldn't even worry about when to flower until you have a decent sized plant.   As for flowering length, you'll want to wait until the trichomes are all cloudy and maybe a small amount of amber colored ones before harvesting. There's a ton of factors that determine when this will be (strain, plant age, available nutrients, etc.) but about 4-6 weeks is normal."
microgrowery,3bvh56,Shattr,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:34:06 2015 UTC,but about 4-6 weeks is normal.   7 weeks is about as short as you will find for a photoperiod flowering plant and they can go over 14 weeks dependent on genetics.

microgrowery,3btbmb,ScumbagJanitorGuy,4,Wed Jul 1 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why they need LED fixtures in a greenhouse? They're super expensive, and the main advantage of LEDs seems to be heat reduction, right? You could tune the spectrum with LED fixtures to influence growth, but I don't get the impression this is the goal; unless it is, and then kudos.  If you want to adjust photoperiod, you can use incandescent lamps.  If you want to adjust photoperiod, and support growth, then HID just seems to be the better option, especially since it will be dark and cool outside. The Sun is an order of magnitude more powerful than both LED and HID lamps, so that's where most of your growth will come from, ignoring heat effects.   Make sure you get security whatever you do! Scumbags steal greenhouse lights on the regular where I'm from, they're such easy targets."
microgrowery,3btbmb,RespectTheTree,6,Thu Jul 2 02:14:59 2015 UTC,"Even though I'm obviously an LED nut, I have to agree with you.

They have to last a long time. With that in mind it's hard for me to recommend anything other than the Spyder series from BML Horticulture. I put them head and shoulders above everyone else simply because of dispersion.  Most other fixtures on the market concentrate the individual LED lights into small spaces on the fixture where as Spyder has them broken into traces and bars. It's a much more efficient way to have an even diffusion of light across what will most likely be a broader canopy. There's at least one other company that has the same idea but I can't think of them at the moment."

microgrowery,3bu8hx,jweeze,-4,Thu Jul 2 19:02:36 2015 UTC,Prefilter indicates that its before the filter....  So you have your carbon filter outside the tent sucking air in and its going put the prefilter?  That would be the air is still going to smell...

microgrowery,3bu8hx,jweeze,0,Thu Jul 2 19:07:45 2015 UTC,Oh yeah i was confused by you saying the filter catches dust from the carpet.  Wouldnt that mean dust is entering your grow space
microgrowery,3bu8hx,Dr-MantisTobogan,3,Thu Jul 2 19:09:45 2015 UTC,"Indoors, it is inevitable.  But most of the dust seems to get stuck in the prefilter.  I haven't seen any dust on my plants cause of this.  I have 3 prefilters that I rotate after they are used then washed.  1 plant from seed to harvest will use about 3 prefilters.  A lot of dust is being caught.  Keep in mind, I'm using a fan and carbon filter rated much higher than my current tent size (for future expansion) the pressure difference is substantial.

Give it plenty of light almost right off the bat, no need to use less light as a seedling etc, just give her all you got almost immediately.  Go with a 20 hours on 4 hours off light cycle.  Autos also seem to particularly appreciate extra air in the root zone.

If it were planted directly in the ground or a 15+gallon pot you'd have a tree right now.

microgrowery,3bs577,GoSwing,5,Wed Jul 1 18:33:12 2015 UTC,"First, I'm not a soil gardener with Cannabis so this might not be applicable BUT.  There is a rule in horticulture regarding potting soil called the tomato rule.  It states that if you use a given soil to grow tomatoes, you need to use it to grow something else for 2 years before replanting tomatoes in it.    That said, you should be able to purchase a soil-free mix and add it as well as some compost to the soil to correct the missing nutrients/imbalances.  Teas I think can also accomplish something similar."

It states that if you use a given soil to grow tomatoes, you need to use it to grow something else for 2 years before replanting tomatoes in it.    It's possible to grow cannabis in the same soil pretty much forever, so i'd assume tomatoes are the same probably lol  Each cycle the plant is removing nutrients from the soil, these things need to be replaced somehow.  An easy way to reuse the same soil is to simply continue to feed normally with an organic veg/flower nutrient brand.  It's possible the soil will be lower on minerals and you'd need to supplement these somehow too.  Probably either through something like compost, ca/mg products, azomite (a mineral mix).  The best way to reuse soil is through no till methodologies. Basically no till mimics nature and you feed in layers by top dressing the soil with things to replace those lost nutrients. Not disturbing the soil ever lets fungal networks get really established, other beneficial microbes are plentiful too, so the soil is just really efficient/fast at breaking things down  It's a pretty fun way to grow, I just stick a new clone into the dirt, top dress a few things and let the soil do it's thing.  The roots of the old plants are broken down pretty quickly actually once the soil is really active and alive. This provides more organic matter which improves soil quality overtime.   The downside is it's really information intensive since you need to know which things have which nutrients   Kind of interesting though I think if you're into bugs and dirt and that sort of thing :)  Sorry for the wall of text!"

As I said I don't handle cannabis in soil, but it sounds kind of like you're saying the same thing as I am.  In short:  1) Plants use up the nutrients in the soil.  2) You can account for this by either restocking the soil with nutrients, or by feeding the plant fertilizer.    Yes?  Either way thanks for the info!"
microgrowery,3bs577,quickaeroponics,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:52:21 2015 UTC,"What quickaeroponics was referring to was in fact true.

microgrowery,3bs577,norklebudz,3,Wed Jul 1 18:59:35 2015 UTC,"You can absolutely re-use it. It depends on how you were feeding your plants, though. Ideally, to reuse your soil you should be feeding with organic fertilizers, and more ideally than that, you should instead be feeding your microbes.   If you're going to reuse your soil to grow pot again, then you'll want to amend it if it wasn't already. Neem seed meal, glacial rock dust, crab meal (or other crustacean meal) and compost (vermicompost rocks, or just use straight worm castings -- but they are more expensive). Throw a mulch on top -- rice straw is great since the only seeds in there will be aquatic.   Now you just have to keep your microbes happy by not letting them dry out or get too saturated and reinoculate them maybe every other week (not totally necessary). I added worms to my pots and they're doing great.  When I harvest I pull out the main root ball to make room for a new plant and just plunk the new guy right into the old spot. Water in w/ Vit.B and top dress with a little compost if I think it's necessary. My first watering after the initial vit.b is with a tea w/ bokashi (a digestive enzyme) -- it helps to speed up the decomposition process of the old roots.   OR build a raised bed for veggies with your old soil -- or post in on craigslist or take it to a place that makes compost and soil mixtures. Or reuse it:) Whateva."

I recently viewed the Cabinet Grow systems at an exhibition, and I found them way too big for what I can accommodate. All the solutions I have seen are unfortunately too big and would look very odd wherever placed in my apartment. As I wanted to start growing again despite the really limited space, I started fiddling around with some components and put together a tiny box that fits in this piece of Ikea furniture I have at home http://bit.ly/1RSOSgD Needless to say it is very limited in the type of plants it can grow dew to the space, but so far the box has worked with Lowryder 2. I will try to find this 3d render I made some time back to show you how I imagine this thing could look if I can figure out some problems here and there."

microgrowery,3brclc,og_skywalker,1 point,Thu Jul 2 11:08:35 2015 UTC,"So, here in this link you can see what the end product would look like. http://bit.ly/1RTwe8n Needless to say, at the moment it's a mix of wood, cardboard and cables everywhere.  It is in essence a tiny grow box for Lowryder plants, with led lights, a hydroponic simple setup, and an air extraction system all controlled by a Rasberry Pi brain.  When closed, it just looks like a box. The box is made so that there is no external sound, light or smell.   The idea is that if you really just want a little personal amount, have severe space issues, need a discrete solution that you don't need to hide or simply are not interested in the gardening aspect, then this would be something for you.  Any thoughts?"
microgrowery,3brclc,Sofakingcoolstorybro,2,Thu Jul 2 11:19:25 2015 UTC,Beautiful setup! What was the yield from those ladies?
microgrowery,3brclc,wickedfapper,2,Thu Jul 2 14:06:05 2015 UTC,"In the 2x4 (Pictured) I am aiming for about 1 GPW. My first run in this cab yielded only 405 grams dry. This harvest I am still waiting for the final cured weight, but I am estimating between 500 and 600.   Thats why I don't understand why people think they are so expensive. I used their financing for my cabinet, and I am able pay it back after 2 harvests (180 Days 0% interest rate) by just donating the excess to a local dispensary. After this batch is cured and gone, it will actually have made me money, after factoring in equipment, nutrient, and electricity usage.  I just got another 2x4 from them last week. This one uses their LED panels which are 5W diode based. I've only grown under HPS or Mars II (3W) LED panels before."

microgrowery,3brclc,black_edelweiss,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:50:00 2015 UTC,"That price is literally insane. I cant believe anyone would pay that much especially knowing that to ship that would cost at least $300 which is wasted right off the bat. Secondly, using HID in a box like that is plain stupid. The ventilation required to keep that cool would sound like a fighter plane taking off and would eliminate whatever tiny bit of stealth it had. A good LED would be the intelligent choice. That box is literally a metal cabinet purchased at home depot for $150, a cheap HID light, a couple loud ass fans, and some mylar. What a complete rip off."
microgrowery,3brclc,og_skywalker,4,Mon Jul 13 17:40:51 2015 UTC,Could you give some links of some brands you're referring to? I've never heard of these.

Some hardcore 90's looking pc grow cases http://pcgrowcase.com/ And some other concealed cabinets http://www.cabinetgrow.com/ Now, I know I am grumpy and all, but those prices are just offensive. Same shitty looking products for the last decade, products never improved, low quality components, etc. Plus, I would imagine the price tag should go up considerably once you include shipping costs. I would say the average person would look at those prices and rightfully say: hell no! Then might look at building something, which for many is overwhelming, and in the end grow nothing. That sucks."
microgrowery,3brclc,SuperbTomatos,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:24:51 2015 UTC,"Building your own pc grow box can be more expensive than buying one especially if you dont have the tools. I built my own, and the 27"" server tower was over $120 alone. I had to buy gorilla glue, 12vdc 300ma adapter, bubble mylar, fans, etc etc, and you cant just buy a small section of bubble mylar. On top of that i did not have a lot of tools so i had to buy them as well. The pcgrowcase.com prices are very reasonable considering it took me several hours to put mine together, and i had to spend nearly as much as they sell theirs for considering all the shit i had to buy. In all actuality i should have just bought their XL pc grow box. I tried copying their style and it still came out looking like shit."
microgrowery,3brclc,TheGardener420,0,Mon Jul 13 17:27:30 2015 UTC,"I personally bought one from Cabinet Grow. Pushed a couple cycles out of it, and bought another one. There is a lot of SHIT out on eBay and other sites. You really need to do your research in this area, as just about anybody can build one in their garage with hand-tools, say it works, and sell it to an unsuspecting idiot.  I moved into an apartment, and didnt have a workshop of my own. So I did the research, and actually ended up driving down to these guy's showroom / factory.   Trust me, I know why they are expensive now.. Tons of side-by-side testing, actual production quality QA, an actual full-time engineering staff, full-time production staff, etc.   Coming from an engineering background myself, just not having access to my tools right now, I appreciate the effort that goes into building these things. It's sad that 90% of the market is billy-bob with a sawsaw in his garage."
microgrowery,3brclc,Pineapple_8ob,1 point,Wed Jul 1 22:34:40 2015 UTC,"Those look really nice. Generally when i consider purchasing something I add the costs up in my head and double it. I wouldnt waste my time for less than 100% markup. That being said, the Cabinet Grow boxes are about 5 times markup if you factor in shipping. I made a similar system (but clearly not as beautiful) for ~$600. I only use 350 true LED watts so my lighting is a bit less but overall very similar. If you can afford $3k for a grow box the Cabinet Grow looks like an attractive option."
microgrowery,3brclc,TheGardener420,2,Thu Jul 2 02:33:51 2015 UTC,"The ones you can buy? Mostly because they're made by people with no growing experience hoping to prey on others with the same amount. Cheap lights are going to be your main problem, as it seems most of these use 1w LEDs add opposed to the more popular 3w. Basically what you end up with is a PC case with a purple night light inside for $200  Making your own is a different story entirely and is here that micro grow boxes really shine. With a little ingenuity you can make a box out of just about anything, small, stealthy and most importantly, CHEAP.  I built a grow box in a speaker box that was a bit over a square foot inside. I took off the back, hollowed it out and cut my ventilation holes. Literally the only things I paid for were my $70 UFO LED and the bag of soil. Everything else came from my house and I harvested almost 2 ounces!"
microgrowery,3brclc,fidentia,6,Thu Jul 2 11:53:12 2015 UTC,"People keep buying them is the short answer ..   It's turnkey and people want to start growing NOW. Whereas, if they took some time and realized they could build something BETTER than those crappy little boxes, they'd probably opt to go a different route.  I myself have wasted a lot of money in this hobby, but it's been a great learning process and has also helped fuel my need to build stuff.  Now, I LOVE trolling thrift stores looking for old cabinets, dressers, etc .. That I can convert.  TL:DR - build something .. Don't waste your money."
microgrowery,3brclc,dingodego,4,Wed Jul 1 15:12:23 2015 UTC,"This industry really needs some innovation... I agree with building yourself given there is nothing decent enough right now. I am so pissed off about this that I actually started to prototype a tiny smart grow box. Don't know if this will go anywhere, but I would like to bring a solution to people who don't want to build, don't want to learn how to garden, etc. Basically a real consumer product, not some shitty garage made thingy with a huge price tag.

I was trying to explain to someone that in the wild weed doesn't start flowering when the light reduces to 12 hours because if this happened you would only be able to flower weed in september/October for 3-4 weeks. instead it starts flowering once it gets to about 16-17 hours of light so it finishes september/October time. actually read what I say before trying to tell me I'm wrong."

microgrowery,3breyc,firesidematches,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:38:46 2015 UTC,"Would be useful. Even better option, a dome with a heating pad. I provide the seed with above the room temp for nearly 50 hours at the start, and I'm not joking, all my seeds become seedlings in way lass than 7 days. And 7 days is the usual germination period.   Do this: Submerge the seed into warmish temp water with pH of 6.0 for about 20 hours, in the dark. If you see it cracked, even a tiny bit, take it out and put it in to warm, moist soil, in some dish or cup, inside the dome with a heating pad, in the darkness. And you will see it breaking ground by around 50th hour, with root in the soil and stem above. At this stage, I very carefully strip away the soil and stick the seedling into my medium with a plastic dome over it for a day or two. I never had them feeling shocked after such transplant.   Don't freak out, it will look pale, almost white. Introduce it to your light, preferably with some kind of cover, like a little plastic dome, so it doesn't get shocked by the change of temp and humidity."
microgrowery,3breyc,TheFAPnetwork,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:09:54 2015 UTC,Thanks I'll have to go this route. I did the water cup thing for this second Northern Lights seed and now it's been sitting in moist paper towel for around 5 days. I keep it in the dark inside my television stand and as of this morning there seemed to be a tiny tiny white slither appearing on the side of it but I can't be sure. I'll pickup a a heating pad from Rite Aid when I get off work and do the dome thing. Hopefully I see some results because my Pineapple Express is doing pretty well and this Northern Lights just isn't working out too well..

microgrowery,3br93l,NecroticFury,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:51:49 2015 UTC,"Good question. I'll measure tomorrow but I think I'm at about 50/60cm now. Was hoping to get to 60cm come harvest but I know that ain't happening unless she comes to a screeching halt, which doesn't look likely given the lack of flower development. Really hope it won't reach a meter. Stealth is an issue so if she gets too tall she may actually have to go.  I've kept in two 6500K bulbs (out of five. That's another worry now: enough light. I'm installing 2/3 meters of side led this weekend, but light penetration makes actually want to lollipop more, even though intermodal spacing is quite high for a bucket plant."

Canna Coco is formulated as a two part system with equal parts of each. The additives like PK13/14 will help during flower to skew the balance towards P a bit more.

You can say, ""oh, my area is very cool with the MARS... blah blah blah,"" but the numbers don't lie.  Efficiency is efficiency and mars/kind/blurple panels aren't having it like the wish/advertise.   I won't even get into longevity and quality issues.  Just because you don't like my attitude, that doesn't invalidate my argument.  Finding it hard to agree with someone that's abrasive like me?

Ask them what their PAR measurements are at 12"", 18"", and 24"" and if they can't give them to you go somewhere else.  Or don't, i don't care.    Stay away from Mars LED's they're known to go poof.

microgrowery,3bs3wq,Mr_Whale,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:35:04 2015 UTC,"Autoflowers are considered more sensitive to nutrients. Always start at 1/4 the recommended dose when you decide to start introducing outside nutrients. If you have a good soil like FFOF that has plenty of nutrients in it, you may not need to add nutrients at all during veg. Never feed twice in a row, they'll need plain pH'd water at least every other feeding.   Just start slow."

For me, this is the closet what the hot water heater is, because it stays in the low 80's for faster germination. 4 days is typical under these conditions.   It is my belief that any additional handling just increases the chances that clumsy fingers will damage the fragile new growing tissue.

Temp swings happen in nature so no problems there just make sure they aren't to radical. And yes its possible the side of the leaf was being eaten. You should get azamax or neem and watch carefully. Wait as long as you can until they are established well and then treat them. But if you have to treat them sooner then do so.

microgrowery,3bpd1c,username18733,3,Wed Jul 1 02:01:24 2015 UTC,The leaves that are already damaged are too far gone. You need to keep an eye on new growth and making sure that looks healthy.   Gradually decrease the pH to the required level to avoid pH shock. The flushing was a good idea. Just make sure you pH to the correct range from now on.

microgrowery,3bnr6u,Lilgrowop,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:42:21 2015 UTC,This link claims that the newer leaves will steal nitrogen from the older ones if there's a deficiency. This seems to be the case for me at least.

I am a noob so I can only tell you what I have and what I have read.   1000 w ballast gets a 1000 w bulb and there should be a switch of some sort to adjust the percentages of light from the 1000w bulb.  What does the manufacturer tell you to do? Put various watt bulbs in the ballast to get the watts you want?
microgrowery,3bnov1,Justintime233,3,Wed Jul 1 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"that's why he answered what you need to do, you gotta use the 1000w bulb and dim that to 750."
microgrowery,3bnov1,Justintime233,0,Wed Jul 1 00:13:36 2015 UTC,Simple. Stop dimming the ballast. You're not supposed to run it dimmed all the time anyhow.   Also a 750w bulb is just strange. It's usually 600 or 1000.
microgrowery,3bnov1,LazyGrower,2,Wed Jul 1 06:17:33 2015 UTC,Well i can't se any reason why i'm not supposed to run the digital power supply @ 750W output when there is setting implemented for it and have a lamp which 750W. That kind of defeats the purpose of having that setting in the first place.

The two little ones are the same mixed gender Green Crack seeds I used my last attempt at growing.

microgrowery,3bn7bh,brmhg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:32:54 2015 UTC,Everything looks good. The yellowing of the cotyledon leaves in the gray pot can mean the plant is zapping some nutrients from itself. May want to increase or start feed depending on where you are with your schedule. Overall the plants look very happy and a quality green. As far as them appearing somewhat stunted to you - what's your watering schedule like or are they just soaking in the rain?

Mars Hydro 300w is a 300w LED setup. My initial impression was that LEDs would run in the $3-400 range for initial costs. This looks like it's the same cost (if not lower) than a T5/CFL setup.

I ran 16 (4 rows of 4) per light and got about 60 grams dry buds per light. Strain played a big part in the ease of running plants so small. The indica strain I ran (Bubba Kush x Skywalker OG) was much funner to grow in that small set up than the sativa I ran under the other light. The sativa I grew just got to tall and couldn't support itself. The indica stayed stouter and didn't need any support. The lights give off a very manageable amount of heat. I hade one 4"" in-line fan hooked up to a carbon filter at the top of my tent and that cooled the 4' x 2' x 6.5' with the two 300w mars hydro lights.  As far as the flowering my clones, I would take a clone and as soon as it had a good amount of roots I would plant it into the 4"" nursery pots and put them under 12/12 right away (no veg time).

Nice split with this though--I'm doing my best to figure out the technical side of things; she'll be overlooking the grow side.    PL-L bulbs and ballasts     Is PL-L a brand name?

I'm not endorsing it or anything, but this page had a lot of useful information in a great format. Not endorsing it in a ""I have no idea what I'm doing"" kind of way. But it seems in line with a lot of other pages I've been reading, so passes on my threadbare reliability intuition.   That was kind of the nature of the thread. Lots of info out there, but it's pretty complicated overall, and I have no idea how to separate pages of bullshit/c&p from other sites from pages of good information.   Anyway, what I picked up from that site is that T-5s are good for coolness and efficiency (remember that I started with a no HID premise), but they don't penetrate very much. CFLs are great for positionability and cheapness, but from what I'm reading they're a bitch to position--and to constantly reposition. They're light reaches just a few inches before dropping off.   So the approach I'm getting from them is to use T5s above and a small number of CFLs inside the canopy where the T5s don't reach. There's also 'SCROG' growing, which I think is training the plants horizontally, but that's something I can't say more about until I learn a LOT more than I do."
microgrowery,3bonlu,LcbZzVd3fS,2,Tue Jun 30 22:10:06 2015 UTC,"I think a more accurate way to phrase what you're saying is...  B1 supplements are snake oil.    And while I don't use or endorse superthrive, I believe it also contains auxins which ARE useful for plants.  Of course, you'd be better off getting those from Kelp, but that is a different issue than snake oil vs non-snake oil.    I think a list of known snake-oil is a great idea, but I haven't found one anywhere and I've done a lot of research on my nutes/supplements.

And the store was right, the only FF nutrient that is specific for hydro or soil is Grow Big. I buy the hydro version of it, but if he says the soil stuff will work if cut by 1/2 than I'd give it a try.   I'll clean out my reservoir a few times per harvest, but sometimes only once or twice.  You plants will eventually start drinking a lot of  the water so you will have to add fresh water anyway.   You need to get a PPM meter. You can see on the feeding chart it shows what the PPM reading should be per week. So just slowly add the nutrients as the schedule says, but check the PPM reading as you go. The plants will also eat the nutrients, cleaning the water.   If you're just using basic Fox Farm trio, Big Bloom, Grow Big, and Tiger Bloom, and will also need to get Cal-Mag plus."

That's why LST and topping are helpful -- you pull down or cut off the highest point and all of the lower points immediately start racing to be the next apically dominant point.  A very short branch could be from damage, light, or just occur naturally. Chances are, the short branch started growing later than the taller one, so it just has a late start. If you haven't already, you could try pulling the tall branch down in order to encourage the lower branch to grow taller."

microgrowery,3bm0ce,Stickybomber,2,Wed Jul 1 01:06:08 2015 UTC,"I said ""mylar is around 92%"" and you said ""mylar is actually about 90-95%"" I'm not sure what your are trying to correct, you just said the same thing I did.    I said matte white has a reflectivity of 95%, you said ""flat white is between 80-90%"", here's a link that suggests I am right. They found plain flat white paint had a reflectivity (for wavelengths between 450-700nm) between 90-95%, and with barium sulfate added that rose above 95% across the whole PAR spectrum.    edit: PAR, not visible"
microgrowery,3bm0ce,LEDwizard,0,Wed Jul 1 15:34:28 2015 UTC,"Standard flat/matte white paint you'd find on the shelf at a modern store is on average 80-90%, which is the addition I am making to your original post.  Depending on which brand you go with flat and matte are interchangeable terms, though sometimes matte could be considered a more durable finish and obviously the exact reflection you will get depends on numerous factors so some could very well be over 90% as an outlier.  I think it's just safer to lump them for the purposes of this application.    On average, Mylar is the more reflective material with both being a great choice."

So this was grown from some random seeds my roommate brought back from Jamaica. This has been an all-outdoor grow in Northern California on our roof deck. It's in a 2-3 gallon plastic pot.   I will definitely try to post some better close ups and some of the entire grow if there's any interest in seeing it. 3 of the plants have budded with this one I think being closed to harvest. There's one other plant that is purple AF which will probably yield more than this one which is probably second best. It all stinks like the dickens. Cannot wait.

The most it will to is light bleach but I have had my panels pretty close and have never seen that. It's probably lockout from salt build up. That happens to me when running FFOF and ff nutes. I would flush with ph'd water. I ended up buying Sledgehammer from FF. I recommend getting that if you are going to continue using ffof. Also make sure you aren't feeding every water either. Should only be giving nutes every other or 3rd watering
microgrowery,3blgfd,Automatik1,3,Tue Jun 30 13:28:05 2015 UTC,This is definitely pH related. Start adding more nutrients (more than 1/2) and make sure it's the correct pH!!

I have limited space (2x4 tent) and want to make the most of it so I am either going to scrog or mainline.  Any experience with either training technique?  I have read that some plants do better than others with these types of training.

microgrowery,3bktmm,EdiblesDidmeDirty,2,Wed Jul 1 02:02:34 2015 UTC,I mainlined a critical sensi star to 8 heads and it worked out great. She stayed real short and bushy.
microgrowery,3bm216,JdH-AU,2,Tue Jun 30 08:56:55 2015 UTC,Don't remove the side branches til the plant recovers from topping. The lower bud sites don't matter since the purpose is to eventually have nothing but colas.  Growweedeasy.com has a thorough guide.
microgrowery,3bm216,FruitGrower,1 point,Tue Jun 30 09:35:25 2015 UTC,I don't remove them other than when I lollipop the plant.
microgrowery,3bku9y,thunderpunchyt,2,Tue Jun 30 01:17:39 2015 UTC,"You could grow and train that plant for several month or more before it flips by itself. For me, the whole idea of grown outdoors is for the huge payoff at the end."
microgrowery,3bku9y,ModernDayNeanderthal,2,Tue Jun 30 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"Sad thing is that this is my first grow so I don't know what half the advice I get is, I can't find a good tutorial for training or anything"
microgrowery,3bku9y,ModernDayNeanderthal,3,Tue Jun 30 15:57:22 2015 UTC,"Then go buy a well reviewed book on marijuana growing. That way, you will learn to grow based on the experience of one successful grower rather than a bunch of piecemeal bits of advice you get here.   I've been gardening since the late 70's,and the very best general gardening book I've ever read is ""Square Foot Gardening"" by Mel Bartholomew. It basically teaches you how to get maximum yield from any garden plant in limited spaces. Most of the general gardening philosophy carries over to indoor container gardening.   I always think it is interesting that marijuana growers put so much effort into carefully calculated and formulated daily pH balanced nutrient feedings, yet struggle so much more than regular gardeners who follow tried and true basic gardening methods in the organic community garden where I volunteer and help people learn to grow their own food. Just last week I was having a discussion about how cannabis is really easy to grow compared to something like a cantaloupe. With good organic soil, you never hear vegetable gardeners debating boron or molybdenum deficiency. The worst they suffer is NPK deficiencies that are really remedied.   Did you know that cannabis is the only crop that people flush all the needed nutrients from the soil right at the end when the plants need it the most? I've yet to see one actual piece of valid scientific evidence supporting this practice. But every kid here will tell you your pot will taste funny if you don't. I suspect that these bad chemical flavors are residual chemicals sprayed on the plants that the grower won't admit to. While I've tasted such things, I have never tasted it in my mostly organically grown cannabis."

microgrowery,3bi2xi,SlowMoWizardry,2,Mon Jun 29 15:52:26 2015 UTC,Removing the meristem (growth tip) to force the plant to redirect that energy to grow 2 main colas instead of one. You could also try the FIM method to get up to 4 colas. I would also look into supercropping those when it recovers from the cut and starts vigorous growth again.

microgrowery,3bk149,YourFriendCody,3,Mon Jun 29 21:18:08 2015 UTC,"1) The fan will be okay for circulating the air in the tent, but probably not sufficient for cycling the air in/out of the tent.    You want the air in the tent to be exchanged with outside air (for CO2) about once every 3-5 minutes.   To do that you want an exhaust fan with a CFM rating of at least 170 for your specific space (it's based on the volume of the tent).  2) Your strip question is harder to answer.  I don't like adapters that remove the ground (3 prong to 2 prong) and your timer may or may not be rated to handle the load of the strip."
microgrowery,3bk149,quickaeroponics,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:29:47 2015 UTC,"Wow, exactly what I needed to hear. I misunderstood what the fans are for in grow tents. I thought it was only to vent and control heat. I'll definitely adjust it, thanks."

I have excellent airflow and good humidity control, so ventilation is not an issue that can be significantly improved my pruning.

Also, I have about 6 more inches in my grow space for height, lady is about 6 weeks veg, when should I look to flowering?   If you want her short, don't defoliate. But if you want to, just cut off the bottom 1/2 - 2/3 of leaves. Not stems. This is called lollipopping.  You can cut off as much as you want. But it should matter whether the leaf in question is getting adequate sunlight, and how developed/underdeveloped the leaf is, as well as where you are in the life cycle.   Defoliate now, wait a week or less, then flip to flower. About two weeks after THAT, you can defoliate once more. But no more after that. And try to take very little. You want her focused on bud growth not regrowth.   Look into super cropping, and FIMMING to keep your plant short. FIMMING gives you the most bang for your buck, if you do it right."

It's hard to know what the drainage, nutrient content, and buildup potential is of any one type of soil, and that matters a lot.  I use coco, which acts like soil but better. You can (and should) water it much more often and you control all the nutrients that go in. Personally, so many of the treatments I do involve water, I'd be drowning my plants if I used soil. I like to foliar spray twice a week on this complex rotation of potassium bicarbonate, hydrogen peroxide, azamax, and spinosad. I also like to add a 325mg uncoated aspirin to each gallon of water, which prompts the plants to be on alert against pest/mildew attacks. Not to mention fertilizing! Everything I do to them involves water, so coco is perfect. If I tried to do it in soil, my poor plants would be dead."

Unfortunately you can't undo the damage but if you feed her properly the damage won't get any worse (ie don't overfeed in hopes that the leaves heal up)  As for PH testing, you can do it yourself, basically you test a class of water, then you add soil and stir and then you test again, look up techniques online, with the money you post you could buy a good electronic ph tester along with the -essential- calibration fluids. If you don't have the money even to spend as an investment, you can get color test for PH for like $5"

microgrowery,3bipif,norklebudz,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:21:51 2015 UTC,"A properly made tea will never burn your plants no matter how much or how often you water with it.   Glacial rock dust is fantastic for micronutrients. Amend your soil with it next time and not again for at least another year. Boom, done."
microgrowery,3bipif,norklebudz,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:38:55 2015 UTC,"You could try foliar feeding to quickly correct nutrient deficiencies so you don't mess with your microbe population. However, organic fertilizers will not immediately annihilate your microbes, so if you must use liquid nutes, definitely go with organic.  The issue with using fertilizers is that your plant is getting free food, so it stops secreting root exudates that attract and feed microbes. Microbes will start to die off and go dormant. Worst case scenario you'll just have to re-inoculate your soil with beneficials.  If you amend your soil properly prior to planting, then there should't be deficiencies (at least not in veg). I would re-evaluate how you prepared your soil.   I dilute a 5gal bucket of tea into a 50gal barrel of water for watering plants. I dilute it further if I'm foliar feeding with it.   Just a reminder : you're not feeding your plants with the tea - in a properly brewed tea, there won't be much (if any) nutrients left over to be feeding your plant. You're creating a massive microbe population that will cycle nutrients and create food for your plant. And unless there are zero microbes in your soil, it is not necessary to water with tea at full strength. Maybe switch to watering with tea every other week and with water in between then.  As for flushing -- I've never been a fan. Chemical fertilizers will leave some salts, but one application isn't a big deal. Watering with a properly brewed tea will correct that."

If you are unsure if your plant is properly flushed snap off a leaf stem and taste the fluid. If you taste any bitterness then you should continue flushing (giving it plain water) but if it tastes clean then it is flushed and ready for harvest.  This very informative guide will tell you all you need to know about flushing and harvesting which is the most important step in ensuring a smoke able product.

The terpenes (smell) are prominent on the stalk and every time you rub the stem that way it gets stronger and more woody like. Sometimes I will grab the plant and give it a gentle yet rough once over to encourage stronger stem and stalk growth. The leaves should be left alone as they are factories hard at work and shouldn't be interrupted.

I know the directions say weekly but what I've read online, and what has worked for me, every 3-4 days is needed. You also need to really drench both leaf sides until runoff. Only way to get the job done is with a sprayer with a pump/hose.   Ladybugs and lacewings are great for controlling infestations but a mantis isn't.

Do this every 3-4 days and then if you don't see a reduction in pests you should try something else.

microgrowery,3beeqr,jazzytime,2,Sun Jun 28 15:09:00 2015 UTC,Tomato leaf spray works for aphids as well and it's organic. You could use that too but Neem oil would be a little more ideal as it protects for up to a month after spraying and it covers all pests that are known to invade gardens.  edit: Use it as a preventative measure during the plants life cycle (except for the last half of flowering) and you should be worry free concerning common pests. edit: http://www.amazon.com/Dyna-Gro-Pure-Natural-Polish-Ounces/dp/B0012BGXVQ/ref=sr_1_4?&ie=UTF8&qid=1435505291&sr=8-4&keywords=Neem+oil

It may interfere with its ability to work as intended, or worse it could cause detrimental effects.  Just curious, why don't you pH your water after adding nutrients?"
microgrowery,3bfree,Mr_Whale,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:31:53 2015 UTC,"I would still check the resulting pH, but I wouldn't have to adjust my nute+water mixture every time I make more since my tap water pH is constant enough and the nutes themselves would be pH balanced."
microgrowery,3bfree,Mr_Whale,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:56:30 2015 UTC,"It's not about the resulting pH, it's the concentrated chemicals in the pH up/down interacting with the concentrated nutrients.   Even if the end-result pH is acceptable, you've mixed multiple concentrated chemicals. Without the safe dilution of water to introduce concentrates, you can't immediately guarantee the mixture hasn't reacted and changed entirely before dilution. It's safety 101 :\"

Edit: Make any adjustments gradually! Remember that pH is a log scale; 6 is ten times more acidic than 7, and 5 is 100 times more than 7."

microgrowery,3bfbnp,Green4Jesus20,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"Just don't try to swing it all at once. For instance, if your runoff is at 5.0, and you've been putting in 6.0, try putting in 6.5 next time, not something like 8.0. You want to slowly bring the soil in range, not instantly change it.  Not sure what the rule of thumb is for outdoor, but for indoor most people say when the first inch or so of soil becomes dry give it some water. If the plant seems healthy, you don't need nutes every watering. Maybe every other or every other 2."

microgrowery,3bejv9,THE_CHRONIC_GARDENER,-6,Mon Jun 29 05:48:45 2015 UTC,"He hasn't added any nutes, it's not pH. The only reason pH is important is basically for nutrient uptake. It's a seedling...just let it be."
microgrowery,3bejv9,Raumz,4,Sun Jun 28 16:46:41 2015 UTC,"pH matters even before you add nutrients to the water.  Outside of nutrient lock out pH can cause metabolic problem inside the plant.  I don't think you would be doing so well if your internal pH was knocked out of whack.  Granted plants have the ability to function under a wider internal pH range than humans.  However, I've noticed that young seedlings and clones seem to be more sensitive to pH than their more mature counterparts."
microgrowery,3bejv9,GO_BILLY,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:02:41 2015 UTC,"It does and it doesn't. With true organics there is no need to pH as long as it's in a range your microbes can thrive. pH is much more important for synthetic nutes. His tap water will have a pH of under 8.0 most likely. His media is most likely acidic. On top of that plants will change their root zone pH based on their needs.  Think of it like this...when you have a glass of water with a pH of say 7.5 then you add some lemon to the water. The pH goes to a point so low our body can't absorb it. However, our bodies buffer this water and turn it to a form our body can absorb. Same goes for the plant. Sure a pH of 14 is going to cause issues, but being somewhere between 5.5-8.0 with organics, or in this case no nutrients, it will not cause an issue. Plus the plant isn't even old enough that to have a pH issue. It takes a while for that to show up and the plant is barely germinated."
microgrowery,3bejv9,IbuyWolfTickets,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"Yea a plant has buffering abilities, but only so much.  Especially the younger ones.  Even if a plant can manage the pH load put on it by too its water being too alkali/acidic, it takes energy to move excess H+ or OH- across cell members.  Energy better used in the growth of the plant.  Also pH does matter in organics, but as there's buffers already present in the soil, there's not as much need for a person to actively pH their water as it goes into the soil."

If you literally just transplanted then just make sure the soil is moist and give them time.

microgrowery,3bdh5w,AdvancedTrainer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:10:27 2015 UTC,"RDWC has a number of advantages in my mind:   Ability to run a chiller More homologous plants (same nutes/ph) Much easier to check and adjust pH Much quicker res changes (i can change out this system in under 20 minutes)   As for DO in a recirculating system vs non... in either case your water should be saturated with oxygen. Remember, warmer water has lower oxygen solubility, so a recirculating system running a chiller will technically have a higher DO level."
microgrowery,3bdr0m,sabotourAssociate,6,Sun Jun 28 06:45:38 2015 UTC,It's a pest known as leaf miners.  Here is a video with a pretty detailed explanation of what is going on and includes a couple of possible remedies. I can't back this guys recommendation because I have not yet experienced a run in with leaf miners.   This is John Kohler's take on leaf miners. He runs a great organic gardening channel. His videos have helped me a lot with fixing up a good soil mix.   Here is a bit of reading on leaf miners as well.
microgrowery,3bdr0m,Naturindoor,2,Sun Jun 28 07:24:49 2015 UTC,"Thank you I really appreciate it, that video was helpful and entertaining.  From what I got neem oil ""azadirachtin"" is the organic solution to deal with many insects."
microgrowery,3bdr0m,Naturindoor,2,Sun Jun 28 07:52:10 2015 UTC,"Neem oil is a great repellent. It needs to be applied frequently to outdoor plants due to rain washing it away. Though for indoor plants one application should last quite a while.  Here is my method for mixing neem insecticide. I've read other methods where insecticidal soap is used in lieu of the acacia gum that I used. One thing is certain, the neem needs something to break it up so it can mix with the water."
microgrowery,3bdr0m,vatobob,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:48:29 2015 UTC,"in the past, with small leaf miner pressures, i just find the bug itself and pinch it with my fingers, most organic method I can think of."
microgrowery,3bdr0m,obstttttorte,2,Tue Jun 30 16:56:25 2015 UTC,"Along with the leaf miners, you might have spider mites as well. I'm saying that because of the small, white specks on the leaves from where it looks like the chlorophyll has been sucked out. The treatment is also neem oil."
microgrowery,3bdr0m,JohnCri,1 point,Sun Jun 28 14:07:43 2015 UTC,"If you can find something called Azamax. Same stuff, concentrated.  Buy it.  Depending on how large your Tree's are, but this can be done up to really large 4 month veg plants.   Take a 5 gallon bucket or a shallow basin something that you can fit the entire plant in.  Mix your Neem, Azamax into the bucket. Check the PH of the water.  I recommend using 1/4 less than they recommend.    Then this is the only way to garuntee coverage of the Neem oil to the whole plant.  Lay the plant in the basin holding the pot out of it and dunk the plant into the solution, swishing around and around for about 10s.  Lift it out of the solution, support the plant mid stem and shake vigorously.  Lay it down to dry for 30 min to 1-hour.    That should solve the problems after a few dunks.  I can make a short video detailing this if you need an example."

microgrowery,3be0ay,melongum69,1 point,Sun Jun 28 10:32:21 2015 UTC,Correct.  The solstice was a few days ago.  The sun is as high in the sky as it will get.  The amount of sunlight is at max.  The amount of light per day will be close to the same for a couple weeks and then slowly get less and less until the winter solstice december 21. This is flower time.

Also the soil will have nutes in it that will take care of it for a while so no need to add those. And when you plant in a larger pot the new soil will keep feeding it.

microgrowery,3bcihn,Canna_Man_Growery,3,Sat Jun 27 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"24 light is good for veg. Def transfer to 1 gallon pot. Then to the final five or seven gallon pot, before you flower.   You can buy cannabis specific nutes online and at hydro stores. Follow the instructions but start the nutes at half strength.   Water with nutrients one day. Only when the soil is dry about a knuckle deep, water again but without nutes. Let it dry out a little. Repeat. Ph'ing your water is the most important thing, along with proper light and water."

microgrowery,3bbqk3,Sofakingcoolstorybro,2,Sat Jun 27 18:49:47 2015 UTC,This is new to me. I'm thinking that super cropping could get rid of these things. You may be able to squish the bug inside. Shining a light on the stalk at night could possibly expose its location by shadow.  Pierce it with a needle perhaps?  I don't know what kind of results might be reached with a dead bug inside a branch. I also can't think of a sure fire way to get it out without going full operation on the plant.  Maybe you could try injecting water into the hole that it crawled through in order to have it run out to avoid drowning.   Can you give us a picture of the plant?
microgrowery,3bbqk3,Naturindoor,1 point,Sun Jun 28 09:09:43 2015 UTC,Supercroping with a flashlight actually sounds like a great idea. I will try it if another worm attacks. Thx!

First off, what you are seeing are indeed pistols however that is different then the ""pre flower"" you are referring to. Those pistols are your first indicator of sex. So congratulations it is in fact female. Pre flowers are more like nubs and are more solid ish. You've got your timing confused. September is middle to late into the flowering stage outdoors for many places. But entirely sure on yours specifically. It is likely too late to start an outdoor harvest this year without clones aged several weeks. Basically plants not clones. June 21st is the summer solstice so the days are already getting shorter indicating the window for veg is closing."

microgrowery,3bbiix,LEGALinSCCCA,6,Sat Jun 27 17:25:20 2015 UTC,"Hello, I previously posted here inquiring about a planned indoor grow. I've since changed my mind and am now planning an outdoor grow in my backyard as it is relatively secluded. I have some questions to maximise stealth and general growing      What is an ideal strain to minimise smell and within reasonable height?     This doesn't matter because you can use Low Stress Training, tie downs, pinching /super cropping, to reduce height.   All flowering cannabis smells dank. They're called terpenes and they are a stress hormone signaling fertility, kind of. But you can use carbon filters in a tent to reduce smell. Or put them in a greenhouse with a carbon filter.     What time Spring / Summer should I plant to achieve this height?    You plant when the hours of sunlight your area receives is more than 14 or 15 (but 16 is preferred,more is better). Then as the hours of sunlight naturally lessen, and when they go below 13, cannabis will begin to flower. It now needs less than 13 but more than 11 hours of sunlight and absolute darkness for 11-13 hours. Absolute darkness is required.    (Live in Southern Hemisphere)   YOU'RE UPSIDE DOWN!     Is it advisable to to germinate, plant into a 1 gallon pot and transplant into the 5 gallon pot?    YES! Up-potting is encouraged as it helps the roots develop a better taproot. But it's not required.    If there are no advantages to transplanting, I plan to plant into the 5 gallon after germination   Go ahead. It's much easier. But get some long bamboo (or similar) stakes and when she starts to grow, strap those limbs down and open that center up to the light. She loves the light!    Thanks for the help guys   You're welcome. I enjoy helping people grow this beautiful spice."

I have grown 8 oz from a 400w hps, all autoflowers averaging about 2oz per plant, but a 300w led will have poor light penetration so you will have looser bugs and lots of popcorn.

Let them grow naturally or they will spend most of their life recovering from LST instead of producing lots of growth. Your light and medium setup is on point but you should keep them at least at 18/6 for root development. You could expect at the very least an oz per if everything is done right but you can never really predict yield since theyre soo many variables.

It seems (sorry if I'm being presumptious) you've seen a lot of pictures but not really read up a lot yet, so (sorry again if i'm wrong here and you're in total control) nymber one; raise your plant closer to the light as close as you can without burning it. Give the plant some resistance. Use the scrog already, so that your plant has something to do. They like to be touched, so since flowering hasn't even begun I'd give her some stress now. Even a week of extra veg time at this point though, will likely ~double your yield, as it grows exponentially.   Supercrop it, at least.  And go to spacebuckets pronto"

microgrowery,3ba0ct,Ileftthelightson,63,Sat Jun 27 05:18:10 2015 UTC,"Before I grew (so, 1986?) I was in a friend's house and they had a weird light coming from a bedroom. I never even wondered what it was. Years later, I can notice light leaks and tell you what kind of bulb they're using.  The fact is, most people don't notice things they're not familiar with. Anyone who did notice and understand likely grows themselves. Not saying that makes you safe, but I wouldn't worry a ton.  Another example.. walking through a park with my mom, I noticed some kids smoking a pipe. I never saw the pipe itself nor smelled weed, but you know the hand position someone holds a pipe in - it was super clear. After walking a bit I commented to mom about how obvious the kids had been. She hadn't noticed a thing.  People who notice things are often part of the community it means something to. Be safe, but I personally wouldn't worry very much."

Instead of bringing weed with me and risking getting caught at the airport I usually buy it in country. It's easy for me to spot a street dealer, in my opinion they stick out like a sore thumb. On the other hand, my wife has no clue. We will literally walk right buy a dealer on the sidewalk who solicits us and she is oblivious, doesn't even know it happened. My wife doesn't smoke and I don't think she's ever bought drugs in her life.  So to concur, people who know it's a grow tent probably won't say anything, and people who don't know what it is won't suspect it's for weed."

microgrowery,3bbso9,SweatyButcherMeat,2,Sat Jun 27 19:49:31 2015 UTC,I would change the way you are growing. Go with smaller plants and less veg time but more of them. Smaller smart pots like 2 gallon no more than 4 weeks of veg. It could be that your plants are to big and not getting enough light therefore producing light airy buds. Northern Lights comes to mind for a strain.
microgrowery,3bbso9,SweatyButcherMeat,0,Sat Jun 27 20:06:15 2015 UTC,"4 weeks veg from germ to 12/12? I have 6 down now that are on week 2 almost and are at maybe 4 inches tall. How tall should they be going into flower with this cycle? Also, I read up on northern lights and I thought it was rather weak? Am I wrong or is it not that good? Most exotic here is about 300 a ounce, trying to maintain quality and that price"
microgrowery,3bbso9,SweatyButcherMeat,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:24:07 2015 UTC,"Sorry 4 weeks veg from clone. Ideally you will grow out a mother, take clones and once rooted veg 4 weeks. Northern lights is a good producer with good power and relatively easy to grow. I've found that as long as the bud is dank you will get a good price no matter what the strain but that may not be the same where you are. So from seed yeah 6-7 weeks would be better. But double the count and keep them shorter."

Some of my clones take 2 ~ weeks to show any sign of growth. Just trying to clarify. If I double it to say 9 plants (I had a total of 5 this time, 2 were from a bad genetics and hermied) will a 600w handle all of that?"

microgrowery,3bbso9,Nedwon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:48:48 2015 UTC,Do you have a PH meter? Wrong PH causes nute lockout. Check PH after adding nutes.  Water your plant slow with a water can. The shower head is way better then dumping a gallon jug of water. Water until it leaks out the bottom. Dont water again until you stick your finger in the dirt up to your knuckle and its dry. The plant needs a wet/dry cycle.
microgrowery,3bbso9,Nedwon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:45:14 2015 UTC,"I had a PPM meter which I check right regular. I do not have a PH meter being as I was on well water it  was checked  a few times by a friend and it was around 6.2. I guess I need a meter? I do not use a shower head, I will not. Yes, I do not water unless it is dry to my knuckle. I will just add a non water day if its still wet but it usually isn't. EDIT: Meant to say I will NOW .. I said NOT. sounded rude, lol."
microgrowery,3bbso9,Nedwon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:51:00 2015 UTC,When I add organic nuts it spikes my PH out of the 6.0-6.5 zone. It goes up to 8.5 or so. My guess is your PH is going up and down and shocking the plants.   Buy a good ph meter. Try to get one that auto calibrates.

I researched it at the time and it looked like nothing to worry about.  Aside from that black bit, the rest of the damage was caused by the lights. I'm mostly worried about the top shoot that was damaged, I'm not sure what result that's gonna have on the topping. The fan leaf is damaged beyond repair, so it's gotta go. Should I prune the shoot as well? Is it too early to essentially top it again?"

I purposely break all my plants in half during veg, and crush the top of every node week 2 of flower. the results: very. (I call it Knuckling, I'm sure there's a proper term)  I think you should give it at LEAST 3 days to heal itself before doing anything else. Maybe even wait for next set of new nodes and continue from there. Keep me posted man. I can show you plenty of bonsai plants and broken stems i have splintered from shit happening. You handled it.

What are you feeding and why  not simply  add more?  That ph isnt off very much.  If those were mine and they were getting overwatered simply move them under cover at night when you say it rains.  Where i live there is often acid rain and the ph is in the 4's.  I wont be using runoff.  When you feed balance that water to 6.3-6.7 before adding.
microgrowery,3bagmx,Dawnsnightmare,1 point,Sat Jun 27 11:49:25 2015 UTC,"Because nutrients ain't free, I balance the water that way and its all good for a day only. I have been feeding them more as i stated, they just dont get better.. They are ok on over watering issues, the only problem I have its that the plants are like in a constant flush for about four hours, then maybe another quick rain throughout the day, and my Ph stays low because of this. I can't move them to shade since they are on a rooftop and getting the pots to a place with shade would require getting off the roof with them so its not possible, I can build them something for shade but I don't want more attention drawn to the area.  So if I DO feed them more than I should and this two are showing N def. What can I do about it since I have a natural  super flush daily?"
microgrowery,3bagmx,Dawnsnightmare,1 point,Sat Jun 27 17:05:23 2015 UTC,Bottom watering will greatly help with this issue but i would replant with a garden soil mix. Its a good baseline for a sprouting plant. I use pure miricle grow garden soil for my sprouts and swap to some mixed medium when i transplant them into 5gal.  If they burn just top water a few times and the excess nuits will run out the bottom...which is probly whats happening to yours
microgrowery,3ba33v,WildcardBuck,6,Sat Jun 27 05:53:39 2015 UTC,You should always bring in fresh air to the tent and exhaust it out wether sending it out the window or into the larger room. This will make sure the co2 doesn't get depleted. If you are cooling the room in which the tent sits then doing this will also cool the inside of the tent. If your not cooling the room the exchange of air will still help the temp inside the tent. So yes exhausting the tent is important.
microgrowery,3ba33v,Justforpot,3,Sat Jun 27 06:54:40 2015 UTC,Pushing air straight outside vs into the room your tent is in won't make much of a difference unless the exhaust from the tent causes the room (I'm assuming you don't pull air in from somewhere else) to heat up.  In which case dropping the temp of the air that will circulate into the tent will help.

microgrowery,3b9m3y,RedAlertKlaxon,3,Sat Jun 27 03:13:57 2015 UTC,"Is it a one-time grow or are you wanting to pump out buds like a pipeline? SOG is going to be your best yield method. If you want solid, continual production, get a veg tent for a mother and clone. Veg clones for two weeks in a smaller veg area, then run a continuous flowering in the other tent, harvesting one plant per week.. In a 2.5x2.5 tent you can put about 9 x 1 gallon pots/bags. Over the course of a year, you'll pull in two extra harvests worth of weight (possibly three, depending on the strain) instead of doing the scrog and long veg thing. If you're just doing it as a hobby, do one plant with a long veg and a scrog. A 400 watt HPS would be sufficient for a tent that size, but a 600 wouldn't hurt. *EDIT: Weight will depend on the strain. Northern Lights from sensi, or Critical Mass from Mr. nice  both stay short-ish, takes abuse like a trailor park wife, finishes reliably in ~8 weeks and puts out very good yield. Maybe...  1 -1.25oz per plant in a 1 gallon container."

If I'm only consuming an oz per month, then I think it would work out to do 2 half-pound harvests per year. I'm trying to keep the process as simple as possible, so I'd rather avoid another tent, and clones, and constantly managing all grow/harvest stages simultaneously... But I appreciate the suggestion. As far as strains go... I picked KC-33 because I read that it is both high-THC, high-yielding, and sativa dominant, which sounds just lovely to me. We'll see how she turns out though. So far she has bushed out like an absolute beast, and I've got about 50 tops flipping to flower today. I'm so excited!... And nervous!"
microgrowery,3b9m3y,Little-Hoot,2,Sat Jun 27 14:17:27 2015 UTC,"Well, I fairly recently yielded about 12-13oz of good solid nugs and another 4-5oz of leafier buds that I used for oil and alcohol, from a 2'x3'x5' closet (6 square feet) so I'd  imagine in a 2.5'x2.5'x6' tent (6.25 sq ft) you'd  be able to get at least a pound total.   I vegged 9 plants of differing strains in 2gal and 3gal pots in a mix of coco fiber, perlite and Fox Farms Ocean Forest under a 400W MH for about a month. They were all topped a few times and tied down/LST'd. Threw out one weak looking plant, then flipped the remaining 8 to flower under a 400W HPS and ~200W of 5000K and 6500K CFLs for about 10 weeks. A bit of unintentional backbuilding from the tips of a bunch of the colas getting slightly light/heat-burned.  I used the Advanced Nutrients Jungle Juice line of nutrients along with calmag and FoxFarms Big Bloom. Standard 4 inch inline fan and ducting with a cheapo Amazon carbon filter.   If I had unlimited time and money but had to fit in that tent, I'd use a 600W HPS in an aircooled hood along with 100-200W of 6500K CFLs in the corners, and an air conditioner running in the main room to keep ambients at 65-70. I'd  use four 5+ gallon pots under a ScrOG, and fill the screen in most of the way instead of the 2/3 to 3/4 full usually recommended. If I'm just going for max yield, I'd  probably only use pure indicas, but if this was all personal use I'd have a mostly indica, a mostly sativa, and 2 hybrids for varying flavors/highs."

I grew 5 plants, 3 of 5 were infested heavily while the other two were clear (for the most part). I used many sprays (mighty wash, azamax, kapow and even home remedies), with very little luck. I didn't lose any plants, but my yield hurt because of it.  I will say two things: make sure you spray every 3-4 days to ensure any eggs get killed as well. Buy a few products that have different compounds (neem, rosemary, lemon grass oil) the mites become immune over time."

microgrowery,3b93th,Accerbus,3,Sat Jun 27 14:11:55 2015 UTC,"Yo dude.   Here's what you need to do: 1) Buy a pyrethrin bomb or two 2) Wash the undersides of every plant with water 3) Drop the bombs and leave the tent overnight 4) Spray azamax concentration on leaves(top and bottom) every 3-6 days 5) Cayenne + garlic:  Cayenne's capsaicin kills mites by damaging their nervous system, while garlic oil is lethal to spider mites. Combine the two for a potent weapon against spider mites on your plants. Blend one garlic bulb with a small onion -- the onion acts as an additional insect deterrent. Pour the pulp into a quart of water and stir in 1 teaspoon of powdered cayenne pepper. Allow the concoction to set for 60 minutes, and then strain out the solid matter with a cheesecloth or sieve. Pour the resulting liquid into a spray bottle and spray the solution on the afflicted plants.  Alternate between these 3 until you flower and you should be okay."

Topping can reduce overall height and it can also boost flower production by creating more than one main cola.  (Instead of growing straight up like a christmas tree, it turns the plant into a 'Y' shape).  You can do this two times if you wish to get 4 main branches.  I can elaborate on why this happens if you need.  I would give the plants a few more days then flip if you have enough headroom."

microgrowery,3b8hp6,mylastnug,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:04:40 2015 UTC,Yea couple more days and I'd definitely flip.  You don't need a ridiculously huge plant to get decent yeilds.  You just need to soak it in light.  Are you running HPS or metal halide?  You only can flower under hps btw
microgrowery,3b8hp6,rastapasta808,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"This is my third run, MH for veg and usually first two weeks of flower then HPS throughout rest of the grow. Last yield was ~17oz including all little stuff.  One of my plants outgrew my light, she wouldn't stop growing. I'm trying to fill my room but keep them at a respectable height. I could always train and cut them back, I'm just b little hesitant as it's something I'm not familiar with."
microgrowery,3b8hp6,mylastnug,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"Yea just flip em at the right time and they'll be happy  Also if they grow up to the light you can supercrop em instead of cutting.  You just use your thumb and forefinger to bend the branch until it 'snaps' then it'll be laying over on its side.  Once it heals, a thick knot will form where you snapped the branch, the branch will grow sideways while the nugs now reach up, and more nutrients will be directed to the branch that has been supercropped.  Its a definite win-win and you don't have to lose that weight/top cola."
microgrowery,3b8hp6,rastapasta808,1 point,Sat Jun 27 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"For sure, I've looked into a lot of these different training techniques. I did a slight LST on a seedling to allow center growth to catch up to the two main stalks, looks decent so far.   I've broke branches, usually just tape it or put some sort of brace to keep it from falling over."
microgrowery,3b8hp6,mylastnug,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:06:34 2015 UTC,"Good, also LST should be used throughout the entire grow so be sure to keep the canopy even as possible by tying down branches.  Look up a couple videos on super cropping.  Its very interesting stuff that goes beyond just breaking branches (some people even stab their branches with stakes).  When you injure a plant, growth hormones are directed towards the affected area.  The spot where it breaks will form a 'scar' or knot and the nug attached to that branch will be denser, bigger, and more resinous than the rest of your plant.  I highly recommend implementing that if plant height or canopy uniformity becomes a problem.  I did it with my plants that were shooting past my light by over a foot and they turned out great"
microgrowery,3b8hp6,rastapasta808,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:34:34 2015 UTC,"I have a stretch issue as well, I'm a first time grower and my mistake was having the light very high from the beginning. Now my struggle is tying them down at awkward angles so they don't kiss the light. I have an hps 400 watt and by the time my cooling hood arrived, they were already tall. So now I'm bending them carefully and tying them at angles. I guess the benefit is now more of the plants are getting light at lower points.   I have four weeks (about) left in flower. I'm hoping I can maintain the height until then"

microgrowery,3b8w2q,SuperbTomatos,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:04:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks! Not sure what was responsible for that. That is only my second grow. Either the training/prunning caused it, or keeping LED lights closer than recommended. Or non-stretchy genes :)"
microgrowery,3b8w2q,DrChloroPhil,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:25:07 2015 UTC,She looks purdy! Is she mainlined or just LST? Flower day 3 mines starting to smell something fierce
microgrowery,3b8w2q,DrChloroPhil,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:23:50 2015 UTC,"Thanks :) Yep, just LST and topping. I haven't grown many strains yet but this one is now in my favourites. hardy strain, amazing smell, had zero problems."

Super excited for the bloom with this new light"
microgrowery,3b8w2q,rastapasta808,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:33:33 2015 UTC,Surely genetics play a role.
microgrowery,3b8w2q,rastapasta808,1 point,Sat Jun 27 04:58:21 2015 UTC,"So same strain can come from very different parents, and get very different results?"
microgrowery,3b8w2q,rastapasta808,2,Sat Jun 27 09:12:31 2015 UTC,"Flowering time is dictated almost exclusively by genetics. Light spectra, temperature, and daily photoperiod play some insignificant roles in determining when a plant ""finishes"" in the wild, but in general, a plant's parents will decide whether it flowers for 8 weeks or 16 weeks. Even among the same strain, there can be phenotypes exhibiting different flowering times."
microgrowery,3b8w2q,guasuir,1 point,Sat Jun 27 16:21:27 2015 UTC,"The short answer is the genes of the plant dictate how long it will take to finish flowering.  Don't know where the strain comes from but it's possible the strain isn't really stabilized so there might still be variation in the seeds.  Yours might just have more sativa dominant genes dictation its flowering duration.  Or it could be another factor like heat or something that are making the buds under developed.  It's kind of hard to say without more info, but the plant looks healthy enough.  If I didn't know that someone else grew the strain in such a short window of time, I would say that it looks about normal for 35 days of flower to me."
microgrowery,3b8w2q,bumfuckOregon,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:28:07 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer. It is very sativa dominant, even the most developed leaves are very very thin, so I think you are right. It's the genes."

microgrowery,3b8ah6,sexydexy316,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:07:58 2015 UTC,"Higher yields, more resilient to stress and less worry about temp control. Plants without co2 stop growing at 84, give or take depending on strain. With co2 they can handle up to 88 without any negative results."
microgrowery,3b8ah6,sexydexy316,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:16:00 2015 UTC,Temps have been great so im not too stressed there.  My issue is the cost of c02.   Extra yield is nice but im also limited to a 3x3.5 space

microgrowery,3b7cny,schwammerlklauber,2,Fri Jun 26 15:43:08 2015 UTC,That looks like a sativa dominant plant... doesn't look anything like the blackberry picture that is posted on their website. So I'd say you are looking at 40+ days on the short span of things. That is going to be one dank plant though.
microgrowery,3b7cny,ShroomPickin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:26:24 2015 UTC,"its my first grow, so i'd be courious how much i still can expect?  will the mass roughly double? tripple?  or is that it, size wise, and it only ripened up?  and any rough estimates how much longer it will take? 3 weeks? 6 weeks?  according to vendor it should be 3 more weeks.  i know that each strain is different.. but any guess gotta be better than mine :D  PS: those are autos, sprouted may 24th.  pps: i've been told to keep them on veg nutes just until this here happens. hope i did not fuck up my yield. growing on coco, no visible defficiencies so far."
microgrowery,3b7cny,Canna_Man_Growery,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:46:15 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to the dates the vendor gives. Those dates are based off of PERFECT growing conditions with the best lights, nutes, and huge pots. Just keep an eye on the trichomes. Looking for mostly cloudy trichs with some amber. The more amber, the more couchlock."
microgrowery,3b7cny,Mr_Whale,1 point,Sat Jun 27 02:08:06 2015 UTC,"Without the strain name or a picture of the whole plant we can't estimate size. It's early in flower still so there's quite a ways to go.  Timewise you've got more than 3 weeks man, I'd say 4-6 most likely. Vendors lowball life cycles for your business, but you'd need the ideal environment without any hiccups to finish in their magic 60day time frame. Use it only as a rough guideline."
microgrowery,3b7cny,hotpants69,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:03:31 2015 UTC,Thanks mate. I was kind of worried she is gonna finnish this small. But having more time left is good news xD  Shes a fastbuds blackberry. And 30 cm high.
microgrowery,3b7cny,guyinthetrees,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:17:00 2015 UTC,My guestimate is 7-8 more weeks. That is all ;). I think vendors start the counter at this point in the flower life cycle while growers start the counter when they flip the lights. always results in early harvest discrepancies and misfeedings

microgrowery,3b7h62,milliGraham,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:16:36 2015 UTC,"More detailed info: I bought these Gorilla Glue #4 clones from a dispensary in LA County on the 20th of June. I kept them in their rockwool medium and transferred them to 10 gallon pots with a mixture of coco coir and FFOF that had been previously leached (in order to avoid a heavier nute burn) two days later on the 22nd. I think the white spots are just from sun bleaching as these clones are seeing sun for their first time? I'm just curious as to what is causing the leaf deformities, are these clones still experiencing some burn from the harsh FFOF soil? Or could it just be transplant shock? Is the droopy nature of the leaves due to overwatering? I've been giving them each a third of a watering can each day. Also the stems are completely purple and some of the leaves are beginning to turn purple. I think this is normal for this strain but I’ve only personally grown sativa or sativa hybrids before and I figured the purple coloration would develop later in veg. Does anyone have any clue if my guesses are accurate? I tried doing my own research for a day or two and this is what I’ve come up with but would love some 2nd opinions."
microgrowery,3b7h62,purp13rain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:18:49 2015 UTC,Most strains will not purple in veg and often won't purple until late flower. It looks like you have a phosphorous deficiency. I've used FFOF exclusively for a long while and have never had an issue transplanting a clone straight from rockwool into FFOF. My guess is you leached too much of the nutrients out of the soil and you'll need to feed with your next watering
microgrowery,3b7h62,purp13rain,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:40:43 2015 UTC,That's what I thought as well about the purple. I only leached the soil with a gallon or so for each soil mixture as I was mixing coir in equal parts and didn't want the dust. I have organic nutes should I really begin feeding already?
microgrowery,3b7h62,U_R_Tard,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:43:25 2015 UTC,Organics tend to be very forgiving as you can often begin feeding early.   Keep an eye on the plants to see if they perk up at all. If it seems like they're getting over the shock then maybe hold off on the feed and just water with some blackstrap molasses added (1tbs/gal). If they still look hungry when you're ready to water then I'd go ahead and listen to what the plants are telling you.
microgrowery,3b7h62,U_R_Tard,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:36:31 2015 UTC,Sounds good I'll give them some nutes and see how they respond. Thank you!
microgrowery,3b7h62,LEGALinSCCCA,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:54:02 2015 UTC,"They look over watered.  Maybe mold, or you spilled water on the leaves.  Direct sunlight shouldn't be the problem either.  I'd only water when they're completely dry.  Rarely everyday.  Also with ff soil the more you water the more the roots are sitting in nutrient soup, so it could be experiencing shock/burn from just simple over watering."

microgrowery,3b7r6g,BoxfanLawnmower,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:28:21 2015 UTC,A couple of things look wrong to me. Water on leaves shouldn't be there as they can act as magnifiers and burn the plant. It looks like the hps is too close causing both light and heat stress and that is what is most likely causing the problems you are having.
microgrowery,3b7r6g,Justforpot,1 point,Fri Jun 26 17:38:04 2015 UTC,It'd be nice to have pictures in neutral lighting so we could see the discoloration. All I see is orange!  The leaf curling is caused by heat stress. Have you been using an hps the entire time? How far away is it?

microgrowery,3b8544,toxicdredge,-1,Fri Jun 26 19:08:44 2015 UTC,"Wow. I've only seen one stretch worse than that. Stretch is when they are focusing energy on getting closer to light, instead of leaf and bud production.   My suggestion for light, is a 90W Mars Hydro LED. It'll only pull about 50 or less watts from the wall. Not sure on the technical aspects, but I know it will be negligible on your energy bill. The same as  putting in a normal light bulb in your house, relative to your energy stats.   Then, put a small fan on directly facing it so the leaves are moving a little but not too much, that causes wind burn.   Now, get some cannabis specific nutrients. Any brand will work.   Now if you want it to flower, you need  to give it no more than 12 hours of light, and less than 12 hours of 100% darkness. When I say 100% dark, I mean it, because that's important.   Wait times depends on strain. But you can generally tell when it's ready. 55 days is right in the middle. You can do 60-65. No more than 70 unless you want problems and an impotent high.   Read the sidebar.   Good luck!"
