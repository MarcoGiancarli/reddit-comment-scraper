Comment like ""lol kek"" should get downvoted as they don't contribute anything,  while a contribution that you simply don't like should just be ignored. Ideally,  a post that is only favoured by the contributor has exactly one point in the end,  as there is only one person liking it.  More people liking something then equal more upvotes..."

oneplus,3e2eaf,DangerousDac,13,Tue Jul 21 12:52:26 2015 UTC,photos were banned here if taken on the phone but then the mods changed the rules
oneplus,3e2eaf,alexc648,12,Tue Jul 21 13:23:08 2015 UTC,"It's a double-edged sword and we jumped between those two option several times already. The final conclusion was that this community is nowhere near big enough to split it. Instead, we added linkflairs and filters, which nobody seems to be using.   Just click here and check it out for yourself  While I have plans to start promoting /r/oneplusphotos again, we definitely wont ban pictures here."
oneplus,3e2eaf,UbiquitinJo,4,Tue Jul 21 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"Maybe you should promote /r/shotonandroid instead? Having photography subs for every device seems unnecessarily niche, even for Reddit.

oneplus,3e2eaf,Jisifus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:25:40 2015 UTC,"Thats all well and good. I'm not exactly coming out entirely against these picture posts, I just remember there being an effort on the part of the mods to remove them from this sub, and I wondered what warranted the change."
oneplus,3e2eaf,Armsheezy,2,Tue Jul 21 20:27:27 2015 UTC,"I was the one who complained about them about half a year ago here, when I wasn't a mod.

oneplus,3e2eaf,broski177,18,Tue Jul 21 20:33:59 2015 UTC,I agree. Though they are good (well some are) I would not prefer to see them on this sub Reddit   Edit: I just heard that r/oneplusphotos is mostly not used due to limited community. Well if there's 10 photos on the frontpage like everyday then it's a good idea to post it on r/oneplusphotos
oneplus,3e2eaf,Armsheezy,16,Tue Jul 21 13:30:21 2015 UTC,I'd rather have pictures and similar OC than the same old tech support and questions.
oneplus,3e2eaf,broski177,11,Tue Jul 21 14:02:32 2015 UTC,Well there's a dedicated sub Reddit for the photos taken from the OPO.

oneplus,3e2eaf,linuxwes,2,Tue Jul 21 14:23:39 2015 UTC,Oh okay. I respect your opinion. But certainly if the whole frontpage is full of content which should've been on its own dedicated Sub Reddit then I feel mods should do something.
oneplus,3e2eaf,Armsheezy,3,Tue Jul 21 14:39:23 2015 UTC,"No, users should do something, downvote what you don't like."
oneplus,3e2eaf,misteral,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:43:15 2015 UTC,Yeah. That definitely should be done and I am sure many do it.

I think that at this point when you're knowledgeable enough to flash stuffs, wouldn't it be more effective to report those issues in the xda threads or G+ communities dedicated for these...? And the reason why/r/oneplusphotos didn't work is because the community is not big enough so dividing it isn't a solution. More diversity, the better."

On KitKat, if I'm not mistaken, an app was not able to keep mobile radio active when it was not running in the foreground, other than for small wakelock/push notifications. I don't seem to be having too many problems with battery when on WiFi, the main issue is when I am on mobile data only. I was just hoping the Kernel that different ROMs use could fix the MRA bug."

oneplus,3e1k4s,Martin3dimitrov,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:01:22 2015 UTC,Thanks! I was reading some of the comments.. Does it feel as cheap as they say it does?

The only problem I have with the case is the bumps on the sides because sometimes it makes it more difficult to pull out of my pocket, but other then that a great case for the price."

To get maps to work I have to enable high accuracy location, restart the phone, and then type in my destination. It probably has something to do with the fact that I usually keep location disable to save battery."
oneplus,3e3k1o,skyliner99,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:14:31 2015 UTC,"Once in a blue moon I notice GPS fails to lock (I use high accuracy). Given that data connectivity is working, it seems to be a glitch. I typically then use GPS Status and reset GPS dataand have it redownload all the aGPS information.  As for your issue--device only is typically worse off. Its using GPS only without cellular or network information. That should be slower. The reason phones can lock quickly is because they use cell tower info plus GPS to help out. However if you pre-download aGPS information using GPS Status for example, its pretty decent at locking. I've tried doing GPS locks on a plane (no WiFi) and my OPO can accomplish it in 30 seconds assuming I'm sticking my phone on the window."

Other phones that I've owned would simply shut down if they got too hot. Can't confirm that the OPO does this, but I imagine that it would be the same.   With a bit of googling, I found people saying that 60°C is normal under load. Some references even mention 70°C to be a normal load temperature. All in all I wouldn't worry too much about that 50°C  Also interesting, from the first link:    I'll suggest to you switch to either Balanced or Performance mode while playing heavy games. If the processor is underpowered and you try running high graphics game, it will surely overheat. First try with Balanced mode and then switch over to Performance mode."

oneplus,3dvxv2,Gseventeen,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:31:57 2015 UTC,no. one of the main reasons the oneplus one sold so well was cause of the price. it was priced alot cheaper for the good specs.   now its not. there is nothing special about it now. stock android can be achived on any phone. so thats not really a selling point. oxygen is not stock android btw

oneplus,3dxjm1,skanadian,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:07:06 2015 UTC,I've decided to give this one a try - flashed over 7/20 nightly. Will report back in a day or two.
oneplus,3dxjm1,tty5,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:54:30 2015 UTC,I am running 1707 and so far I haven't experienced any of the issues from the past. The one and only problem that is still present is the proximity sensor when receiving calls. Screen doesn't unlock even if the phone is on a flat surface.  Other than that everything's good. No wake locks no unnecessary drains.
oneplus,3dxjm1,_Blazin_,2,Mon Jul 20 13:03:43 2015 UTC,Proximity sensor has been working for a while. Check your modem/radio/baseband version. TWRP hasn't been flashing the modem partition properly since 2.8.6.0. You need to do it via fastboot.

oneplus,3dxjm1,thatguy314159,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:55 2015 UTC,You could but I'm not sure how far back you have to go and I'm also not sure if the old versions play well with newer ROMs.  My recommendation is to use fastboot to flash your modem.
oneplus,3dxjm1,dlerium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:45:43 2015 UTC,Can you go into detail a bit :D I'm not really sure I know what to do
oneplus,3dxjm1,_Blazin_,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:52 2015 UTC,"Take a new CM nightly (assuming the radio hasn't changed in the past month or so). I had 0712 nightly when I did this last week. I pulled out the NON-HLOS.bin file which contains your baseband. Reboot your phone into download/fastboot mode. Use the ADB command ""adb fastboot flash modem NON-HLOS.bin""   If you're not familiar with ADB and how it works, you might want to read up a bit. This used to be the most frustrating thing and after years of Android use I still failed to understand it. However after I managed to ""brick"" my first OPO, I really learned how to flash via Fastboot and what it does.  Also, there's a guy at XDA who posted what the latest baseband (from last week) should look like. I would ignore the part about downgrading to that custom TWRP or whatever. Fastboot is the most reliable way of flashing things. Period. TWRP and recoveries were made to make life for newbies like us easier, but if you want to guarantee a flash, use fastboot."

No remote session needed luckily. brand new replacement phone had dust behind the rear camera lens which resulted in partly blurry photos   Took only one day till I got my RMA approved. The device has been picked up last thursday and delivered the next day on friday.  I already got the message that I will get a brand new OPO and they are currently awaiting confirmation from the warehouse that my new OPO has been shipped.  So far I would say that the support tends to be more on the positive side, at least for me. I also heard bad stories from Samsung, HTC and Sony. It all comes down to bad luck I guess.  The best support I got in the past was hands down from Google. I had various issues with the Nexus 5 and it got replaced two times without much hassle.

The SuperSU binary is an unsigned zip - in order to flash an unsigned zip, you must have a recovery that accepts a zip file without an authorised Google signature. Official recoveries must require signed zip files in order to pass Google certification. Hence, you need a custom, unofficial recovery to flash the SuperSU binary.  Secondly, yes you can get OTAs with a custom recovery, but you have to perform the final step of flashing manually from the recovery screen.  If you need any more information or advice, feel free to ask."

oneplus,3dythj,cyborgnaes,10,Mon Jul 20 17:16:00 2015 UTC,People are more likely to post about issues rather than a phone that works the way it is designed to.  Have faith you invested in a great product.

oneplus,3dythj,derpoftheirish,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:55:38 2015 UTC,"I'm coming up on a year with mine. I started getting the touchscreen heat issues a few months back, literally about 2 weeks before the fix was released into franco kernel. So that was almost a non issue. Other than that it's been great.   Btw at one point the sub did a survey that covered various reported ""common"" issues. The results showed the first ""big fail issue that everyone has"", which was the yellow tint at the bottom of the screen (apparently bad drying on the glue, goes away eventually) was only in 15% of respondents. And this was a self report survey, so more likely people with issues were going to respond.   The biggest issue that does seem to be somewhat universal is bad customer service. You aren't likely to have a problem, but if you do you have a good chance of being given the run around. My suggestion would be if you come across a big issue don't wait on it. Make sure you push it with OP while you are still inside the PayPal charge back window, and don't be afraid to use that option."

Only tried it for a couple of hours, though:   Kind of cheesy boot animation and wallpapers, really looks like the work of a high schooler. It comes out of the box with no browser, even with their Gapps package, wtf. Just DL from play store, though. When you get a heads-up notification, there's a ""Zzz"" symbol next to it. Click it, and it will disable headsup for 5 minutes, a feature I haven't seen before. Still, it just ""hides"" the headsup behind the notification bar, there's a couple of pixels showing. Fast and fluid, seems stable Includes an app called ""Layers Manager"" which is supposed to give you the ability to apply skins to one app at a time. Tried it on my dialer, and got a random reboot. Great to have all customization options in one place under settings called ""Tweaks"". However, the functions itself aren't revolutionary - nothing I haven't seen before. Still great to have them all in one place.   IMO, nothing really ""new"", just cherry picking combined to a single, fast ROM. Could do for a great as a daily driver, but I'm already using CM12.1 Sultan and there's nothing from this ROM I would really miss by going back.  Great to see ROM's other than CM, hope they'll do good! :)"

I don't see an improvement.  Why would i want to use 2g+wifi? When i'm in wifi the mobile radio is not draining the battery at all.

oneplus,3dtqnn,Majinferno,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:27:18 2015 UTC,"Mobile radio active isn't draining while connected to WiFi, you need to be on mobile data in order to get drain, so no, it doesn't help at all."
oneplus,3dtqnn,maxver,0,Sun Jul 19 14:33:34 2015 UTC,Sorry about that. Misunderstanding on my end. :l
oneplus,3dtqnn,Majinferno,9,Sun Jul 19 15:27:00 2015 UTC,"It isn't fix. Mobile radio active is mostly active during mobile data usage. Mobile radio is clearly caused by background data transmitions so in order to fix it yourself, you need to disable background data but this will result in no notifications at all because you will simply block it - so no messages from whatsapp at all, only when you open it.   What this app does, is disabling mobile data when connected to WiFi, but what's the point when mobile data is disabled by default by android system? When you are connected to WiFi, you will not have mobile radio active drain. So this is pointless."

Why don't I just do that in Tasker and save myself the shady recovery flashing?  Edit: Here's a GDrive link to the profile I just made for Tasker. It disables Mobile Data when connected to any WiFi, and turns it back on when disconnected. You will need the Tasker app + Secure Settings (for turning data on/off). Both available in the play store and very reliable.  Edit2: Further instructions: after downloading Tasker and the XML file you downloaded from the link above, simply tap on the Profiles tab in the app and select Import. Navigate to the downloaded file and select it. That's it. You just achieved the same without flashing anything."

oneplus,3ds0qi,SOCIALCRITICISM,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:02:34 2015 UTC,GMD gestures combined with Niwatori - One Handed mode is the most epic and easy to use one handed mode.  GMD gestures combined with tasker tasks. One example is double tap to Greenify on status bar so I have turnes off Auto Hibernation in greenify and just double tap the status bar and it puts the device to sleep as well as greenifies the apps.
oneplus,3ds0qi,Suuurpine,2,Sun Jul 19 03:10:49 2015 UTC,"With nova you can double tap any part of the screen to hibernate, not just the status bar."
oneplus,3ds0qi,fuzzybearcow,2,Sun Jul 19 08:33:21 2015 UTC,Yes I know that but:   I don't use nova.  Even GMD Gesture Control can do so but the main objective of what I said is to not have to go out of the way just for hibernating. I just DT2Sleep as usual and even hibernation gets triggered.
oneplus,3ds0qi,Suuurpine,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:38:13 2015 UTC,GMD gestures allows you to make a gesture to enable sleep mode from ANY screen. not just home screen.

oneplus,3du1tz,fuzzybearcow,2,Sun Jul 19 14:24:10 2015 UTC,"It seems unlikely, but I imagine the stock will only get more scarce so if you have a chance I'd jump on it as opposed to a potential saving of ten bucks in a months time."

I'm not really sure why people give so much about benchmarks. It's all about software, some people say the note 4 lags on some occasions which I really don't think is because of not enough processing power. That thing has so much power, it's just because of the software.   The oneplus uses nearly stock Android, the performance is great and it can run with much less power than it currently has. No need to risk overheating because of 2000 points more on the benchmark or so.   Still, Qualcomm has to get their shit together and deliver chips that don't overheat."

oneplus,3dptg8,highdiver_2000,2,Sun Jul 19 00:06:38 2015 UTC,"I know we want to bash OnePlus, but read the article more carefully. This is words coming out of a spokesperson who probably has limited technical knowledge.  Here are a few excerpts as well as the analysis:   As Qualcomm put it: ''In addition to continuing software tweaks and optimizations, additional updates include process improvements from the foundry that help improve power and performance that are specific to the manufacturing process node.''   So there is some manufacturing changes involved. Now granted the next line says that there isn't enough justification to call it a different version.    Not quite. Qualcomm was quick to point out that process improvements do not justify calling a later 810 a ''different version'' of the chip: ''The software flag that changed from 2.0 to 2.1 simply showed a revision point that reflected this combination of software implementations and process improvement.''   However they admit there are changes. It's kinda like when we make fixes to our products (I work on medical devices). We don't necessarily sell our products as version 2.0, but we do make design changes along the way to address issues such as reducing complaints, etc. Without understanding the full scope and magnitude of these changes, an external revision is not in itself a determination of whether or not there is improvement.  So maybe based on what HTC said, 2.1 was used all along, but the reviewers like Anandtech got to look at v2.0 in their engineering evaluations and therefore were able to make comparisons.  I think the conclusion is that 2.1 isn't a revolutionary change, but there are SOME changes. We don't know the details, and if anything this article is aimed at slamming OnePlus as much as possible. Why not keep it objective and investigate the true differences like Anandtech did? Maybe even taking temperature measurements would be more beneficial. Otherwise, this article offers as much weight as OnePlus claiming their v2.1 usage is so special that we are all to be shocked."
oneplus,3dptg8,dlerium,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:28:21 2015 UTC,"The htc m9 uses the 2.1, enough said. Most OEM already use 2.1. So telling that they got a 'new improved version' is kinda of a lie. Any judgment has to be given after testin the phone, but yet, their advertising is miss leading, and this remembers me of the 1+1 under the Z1 picture, true but really ambiguous. I personally don't like ppl bashing a company or being fans of it, I just want to understand if this phone will have issues like the other 810 phones, and atm the clues bring me to think it will have the same issues."

Either way. r2.1 is still crap. look at the Z3+.  In the case of OnePlus, the phone will be underclocked to 1.8Ghz if i recall right. we don't know how much that would limit the CPU. but that should reduce the heat given that it uses less power.

OnePlus didn't magically find a solution, they underclocked it to 1.8Ghz. On release the m9 was 2.2Ghz then dropped to 2.0Ghz it DID help reduce the heat (because it delivers less electricity). its simple workaround but at the cost of performance.. the question is, How much performance are we sacrificing for this ""cooler"" temp on the 1+2."

oneplus,3dptg8,nybreath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:38:43 2015 UTC,"They did downclock but not as low as 1.8Ghz. yeah the m9 hits that when it throttles but the 1+2 will run at 1.8Ghz by default. others downclocked, yeah, but not as low as 1.8Ghz and that's what i have been saying. i clearly stated that the m9 was 2.2Ghz and then after a software update they downclocked it further to 2Ghz.   No, i do not call it ""careful development"" and actually no one did. only Xiaomi claimed to have helped qualcomm, OnePlus said they worked with qualcomm to finetune the software.  I am not saying the S810 is perfect now, but im saying the oneplus 2 will use a different approach that the others didn't take. (further downclock, plates to cool and dissipate the heat further using graphite and thermal gel)  Edit: I'm really doubtful that the 1+2 won't overheat. but im being hopeful and that the steps they said they took, should in theory help reduce the chances of throttling early."
oneplus,3dptg8,JirayaT9000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:01:10 2015 UTC,"Dude the m9 goes down to 1.58ghz,it means that even at 1.8 the soc doesn't cool down enough, starting from 2 or 1.8 won't do anything else than giving you a couple minutes more before going down to 1.58"
oneplus,3dptg8,nybreath,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:30:12 2015 UTC,"Thats not what downclocking is. by default the m9 is 2Ghz. that's what the CPU works with in perfectly regular circumstances.  When the CPU works at 2Ghz and hits a certain temperature. it throttles down the CPU in order to prevent damage to the CPU/Phone.   But by that time the CPU has already reached that max temp and it keeps operating at lower speed. that lower speed will still generate heat because that's how electricity work. but it generates lower heat than at 2GHz. that extra heat will reduce the overall CPU temperature overtime, but since the S810 is a complete disaster. even at lower clocks the cores generate way too much heat.   the key here is generating as little heat as possible at the beginning else its basically a lost fight. what OnePlus is doing is generating less heat and dissipating it faster than other phones.   Theoretically speaking that should either  keep the S810 operating at 1.8Ghz for longer than 10 minutes. or magically just keep it operating at 1.8Ghz at all times when not gaming of course.   (the latter is unlikely given that this is the S810 we're talking about)"

Btw what I meant is, downclocking to 1.8 isn't a solution, m9 showed that it has to go down to 1.58 to reach an equilibrium point, so setting it to 1.8 will not do anything else than delay the moment it has to go down to 1.58. Or oneplus found another way to cool it down or setting it to 1.8 isn't not even slightly a solution."

If you don’t have the $299 upper limit of the Oneplus One as your budget then you should wait for the 2. Also it would be invite only so it would take some time to get on your hands but this time the invite system is better. If you urgently need a device then even the Oneplus One is not bad at all.

oneplus,3dqom4,pieandablowie,5,Sat Jul 18 15:01:11 2015 UTC,"I too am running latest CM12.1 nightlies updated regularly with CyanDelta and have dabbled a bit with encryption on the One. First of all make a TWRP backup of your phone, and store it on your computer as well, in case something goes wrong so that you can go back, 'cause you can't decrypt it once you've encrypted it - you have to fully factory wipe it to get back to unencrypted state, as you probably know, and then a backup comes in handy. In my experience though (this is with nightlies about 2 weeks ago) with encryption on nightlies, it doesn't appear to be functioning perfectly; I have been able, while encryption has been active, to access to the recovery of the phone decrypted without entering my decryption key to decrypt, also my phone has sometimes booted straight into the launcher without asking for my lockscreen code, this was of course concerning and there's no point in having encryption active if it doesn't work 100% reliably, so I went back to unencrypted CM12.1 nightlies. These issues might have been fixed since then in the nightlies, but I am waiting for an official CM12.1 release to try encryption again.   The flashing/upgrading process though, shouldn't become more complicated, because TWRP has decryption support & you can do necessary changes once you've put in your decryption key & have proper access to your files in the recovery. I have not yet tried using CyanDelta with an encrypted phone, I assume that when you want to flash a zip and it boots the recovery, the only change is that you put in the decryption key and then the app continues with the flashing of the update."

Oppomart is not officially affiliated with Oneplus or Oppo and the specs on the site doesn't agree with what we've already been announced.   4gb ram (official announcement) vs 3gb ram  13mp camera (mkbhd) vs 16mp  Sony is not listed as a OP2 partner (conjecture)  dual sim (Pete Lau) vs single sim  EDIT: just went to the Oneplus 2 page on oppomart.

He does stress that the camera's great and that they worked really hard with sourcing it and optimizing it. He mentions that his workers said they've been working 7 days and they're tired and he'd ask ""have you gone mad yet? no?""

I'll list all the bands that the carrier advertises that they support. Ultimately it'll be up to the user to verify (with the carrier) frequency availability based on their location.

If it's the rendering that bothers you, take a look at my Indiegogo page (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/willmyphonework-net), there's some concepts in there for multiple carriers and advance lookup. Let me know if that makes looking at the networks easier."

oneplus,3dk3wc,Neosaurus_,8,Fri Jul 17 03:26:50 2015 UTC,People have this misconception that Toshiba makes bad sensors. It's probably because of HTC M9's terrible rear camera that is a Toshiba sensor. Nokia's 41 MP shooter is a Toshiba sensor as well and it is one of the best cameras in a smartphone. The truth is M9 doesn't have a good image processing software so it's photos and videos will probably be just as bad with a sony sensor.

oneplus,3dj016,fatherswatch,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:26:03 2015 UTC,Samsung only sells last generations screens so we could get a S5 or Note 3 display. Not a S6 or Note 4 one.
oneplus,3dp7lp,juggzz,3,Sat Jul 18 03:10:22 2015 UTC,"Well it was revealed that the 1+2 was going to be under 450. And what do you mean you've seen the S6 sell for less than $500? You gotta give more info on that, such as Where it was bought, From who, is it unlocked, new, etc. Etc."
oneplus,3dp7lp,WizardBrownbeard,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:14:25 2015 UTC,"S6 unlocked on ebay a few times from reputable sellers. T-Mobile has the LG G4 at $479 now. My point was that if the OP 2 sells at around $450 or just below, it has some tough competition out there from more established phone makers."
oneplus,3dp7lp,WizardBrownbeard,2,Sat Jul 18 03:17:58 2015 UTC,"People actually buy phones off of eBay? I don't think the majority of people buy their phones from eBay and usually buy from actual stores. That said One Plus, from what I've seen, has always served a more tech savy  niche than normal phone makers so I don't think that it will affect it that much. That said while the OPO Had some very rough patches it overall cane through with a good performance and that will certainly help them out.   I honestly don't think they're trying to compete with giants like Samsung in terms of quantity yet cause simply put they dont have the resources- its why they have an invite system in the first place."
oneplus,3dp7lp,mizatt,2,Sat Jul 18 03:26:28 2015 UTC,"I would say the T-Mobile store for the G4 would qualify as a place where people would buy their phones. Whether they are trying to compete with the likes of LG or Samsung is a bit irrelevant however, as the competition is there whether they like it or not. Don't get me wrong, I want to get a OP2, If there are in fact no heat issues, a small tradeoff to achieve that through under clocking and I like what I see. Lately I've just had a hard time justifying buying a phone from a Chinese maker when I could've bought the Nexus 6 for $399 the other day on amazon or just go grab an LG G4 for $479 including a second cover and battery at my local T-Mobile."
oneplus,3dp7lp,kvalle100,2,Sat Jul 18 12:16:03 2015 UTC,"You're not using the retail prices of the S6 and G4 but you are using the list price for the OPO. If you're going to consider third party sellers you'll probably have to knock off something from the OPO price, too."
oneplus,3dp7lp,z1onin,-1,Sat Jul 18 05:41:33 2015 UTC,"Well if you end up buying the OP 2 off a reseller then you are likely going to be paying more rather than less due to availability issues.  The trend lately seems to be reduced prices on unlocked phones, and rather quickly after launch. In this market I just think OnePlus has lost that distinct advantage it had with the OP1."
oneplus,3dp7lp,kvalle100,2,Sat Jul 18 11:15:23 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I need a high end smart phone but a reasonable price. I wanted the note 5 but since I'm starting college, I feel like it'll be too much. So if the 1+2 is under 400, that would be perfect for me, because having Cricket Wireless, the gs6 is at least 600+  With that being said, yes the price and specs is attracting me (especially since I don't care about camera) but maybe not everyone. Who knows."

A customer shouldn't go around asking an invite, no company does that. You can argue that you can just wait, but I will argue that if you have to wait 4-5 months to get an invite there will be so many more better phones out. Also the invite is terrible, cause you are forced to take a decision in a few hours from when you receive it.

oneplus,3dlpll,SamFredrico,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:41:35 2015 UTC,"It means that for whatever reason your digitizer isn't detecting touches there properly. This usually means it's broken, ie it's a hardware issue and it needs to be replaced. But first it's better to rule out software. Make sure you are on the latest CM12S, that one should include the touch screen fix, or one of the latest CM12.1 builds. If it still doesn't work, then it's probably hardware.   You can either try dealing with customer service, or buy a kit and replace it yourself, depending on comfort level and if you can deal with no phone or a backup phone for the ~1 month turnaround for an RMA. That is if you can get them to RMA. If you've had the phone for a while and this is a recent issue, they may say it's due to user error and not a defect and deny RMA.   If you have some sort of backup phone, I would try RMA first. Never hurts to give it a shot.   If you go with replacing it yourself, there are a few replacement parts floating around. I've usually seen them going for about 65$. I've heard you need to get one with a mid frame and basically transplant your phone components into the new one, rather than just trying to replace the lcd by itself. There is also a video that can guide you through the process. I'm on mobile right now, I'll see about linking you when I get to my laptop."

oneplus,3dibfp,Balgard,3,Thu Jul 16 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"Threads like this are why I'm starting to sour on the OnePlus. I like using a stock phone. I have no interest in custom ROMs or Xposed. I thought that the OnePlus would be one of the better non-Nexus phones for getting updates, but since Lollipop came out, that isn't anywhere near the case. The marketing told me that I didn't need to settle. But now I'm settling for Android 5.0 when the other flagships are on 5.1.  I thought Oxygen would remedy that. Surely an OS developed in-house would be updated more quickly. But instead they decided to delay it so they could work on their new phone. So again, we settled. I'm sure Samsung, LG, and HTC are working on other phones but they still managed to work on 5.1 at the same time. Unfair comparison because OnePlus is a small company? I call BS on that. We were told that we didn't need to settle.  Sorry for the rant. The lack of a 5.1 OTA is pissing me off more and more every day."
oneplus,3dibfp,Anaron,2,Thu Jul 16 22:36:41 2015 UTC,I agree completely. The lack of updates and lack of communication is the reason the OnePlus one is the last phone I ever buy from this amateur run company.   They can hype the OnePlus two all they want. I will be buying the next nexus phone I guess.   Say what you want about cyanogen at least they fixed the wakelock bug on their ROM.

I'm tired of installing custom ROMs, waiting for Google to fix issues, and waiting for Cyanogen (and OnePlus) to release updates for their respective ROMs.  I'll miss Android and the unique features of CyanogenMod but I'd happily sacrifice those for a better experience and a better camera."

oneplus,3dgbby,depelteau,9,Thu Jul 16 01:26:28 2015 UTC,It's definitely not that. That doesn't raise your phone temp to 93 Degrees Celcius. It's also while the app is open and doesn't affect the old version. People are seeing it use twice as much battery as the screen...
oneplus,3dgbby,Redicus,3,Thu Jul 16 01:29:49 2015 UTC,"It could be that. I rarely use snapchat, but anytime I use my camera, it rinses the battery and I could cook an egg on the back of the phone.

And I am not picking the iPhone because its a flimsy device as the hardware is not strong for adventurous kind like me... and I don't want the out dated iPhone 5S for its well known durable hardware... So the best personalized featured phone according to me with factory software is the OnePlus One. U might say why dont you jaibreak the phone. I don't like to jailbreak the phone as you don't get warranty and Custom Rom's don't have a good update  system to keeping the phone in top notch condition. But its not that I have never done a jailbreak. I have, and enjoyed the same, but I didn't find a reason to do so on The OnePlus One. And that's one of the reasons I am here For the OnePlus Two. That be that. The Most Important Reason why I would Only Pick a Apple Or a OnePlus is  Because these are the two company's making their own hardware and software for the device... And that's how devices blend to give you the best performance. then you might say Nexus Does the same... Hey OnePlus One is a better than Nexus 5...Enough said? and I really want the OnePlus 2 to beat the Nexus 6... as the specs moves it to compete with The NEXUS 6! and the 7 yeah its coming too..."

Now though, phones are pushing the 6"" limit, if we can call it a limit, so now it's just not convenient to carry two phones anymore.

oneplus,3dj5gg,tututurents,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:11:47 2015 UTC,Its all about how it hits... sometimes it is fatal sometimes it doesn't matter. I would keep it on till the replacement arrives like said above. I am also on my third right now but the way I see it is If this broke it might have been my screen if it WASN'T There. It might just be me being paranoid but I like the $10 peace pf mind.   I ride bareback with a Glass protector and I go through one every few months. My wife however has a case (Good god she knows how to break phones) and a glass protector and she has only just now cracked hers with a very minor crack after a very long time.   I also feel that it helps the resell value (Or just overall value). when you take off the glass try taking things and scratching the glass. ITS SOME CRAZY SCRATCH RESISTANCE STUFF! and actually really fun. ha ha. so if you ever DO manage to scratch that screen you know its just a $10 fix and not a damaged phone.   sorry that got long... haha just kept typing I guess...  TL;DR Glass protector good!
oneplus,3dj5gg,Thaxxman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:33:27 2015 UTC,I use a case + screen protector. I have two cases. One is heavy duty and I've never broke the screen protector in the heavy case. The other is a minimal protection case. The 2 screen protectors I've gone through were while I dropped the phone in the minimal case. I'm glad I've gone thru $20 in glass screen protectors as opposed to $200+ in screen replacements

oneplus,3dc59e,SlimeyStuff,1 point,Wed Jul 15 10:51:40 2015 UTC,You have no idea what the OP2 will be priced at so you can't make a 3x the price statement and even the OPO wasn't a third of the price of its competitors it was a little less than half (excluding the moto x.) The difference in price came in better hardware and better service these things may not be important to you but to a lot of OPO users they now realize how valuable that difference is.
oneplus,3dc59e,threeclaws,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:22:28 2015 UTC,"They said it will be less than 450$ so yeah, I do. And the OPO 64gb is priced at 300$, the Iphone 6+ 64gb is priced at aprox 1140$ (But hey, it's Apple.). The S6 64gb is priced at aprox 880$. (These are Swedish prices at least.). I'm not saying that it's wrong to buy a phone that's more expensive for better performance, i'm saying that I personally think that it's weird to buy a phone that has like 5-10% better performance (if any at all) but costs 3x as much. (Not saying that the I6 or the S6 has better or worse performance.)"
oneplus,3dc59e,Rangizingo,1 point,Wed Jul 15 13:24:36 2015 UTC,"You keep saying 3x the cost but neither phone you posted is 3x the cost including the iPhone which won't see a unlocked retail price reduction until the 6s is released. There is no point in bringing up the OPO because it's had price reductions and is over a year old.  Small performance gains alway come at a significantly higher cost when at the high end, it also depends on your definition of performance personally my n4 is fast enough when it comes to OS functionality but the camera is severely lacking in both hardware and software performance (the same is true of my opo.) OP is also releasing their phone 6mos after everyone else to purposely not be on the same release schedule and to take advantage of cost savings.  And of course, as I alluded to before, performance is just one metric to me service is now an equally important metric that I am willing to pay for even if that may result in me spending $600 on a phone (it certainly won't be the first time.)"

oneplus,3dc59e,Icylobster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:16:26 2015 UTC,"A few observations on my end:   MKBHD is probably not the best guy to review cameras if he doesn't understand that aperture is fixed on these smartphones. There shouldn't be any question its an f/2.0 lens. With that said he throws in a bunch of imaging jargon, but I'm not sure if he knows exactly what he's talking about. The OPO comparison shots with the other cameras as well as the OP2 show that the images are underexposed probably by 1/3 a stop at least. It gives you the nice punchy colors because you get darker blacks. That's not a fair comparison. Try taking your Canon DSLR, turning exposure compensation to -1/3 or -2/3 and then cranking the colors to Vivid. Tell me your eyes don't like that more. It's not accurate imaging though. HDR still sucks, but I'm pretty sure it was a firmware/driver issue to begin with. However, this leads me to believe its the same camera module manufacturer and even possibly the same sensor/module combo. Lack of OIS is disappointing, but its not like my images were full of blur anyway. I don't think this is a silver bullet for solving imaging issues anyway. The Nexus 5 is a great example. Users complained about the shutter lag and blurry images, so isntead of allowing 1/6 and 1/8s photos by default, Google bumped the minimum shutter speed to be 1/15s, which is the same as an iPhone 5s/6 without OIS. You're getting no benefit there then, and its not like iPhone users are crying that 1/15s photos are full of blur. The advantage of OIS is that you can shoot at slower shutter speeds while minimizing camera shake, thereby allowing you to decrease ISO for a less-noisy shot."
oneplus,3dc59e,___WE-ARE-GROOT___,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:25:58 2015 UTC,"While I think the camera was overhyped, I actually really like it. I'd say its the best after the S6. I think the hardware is fine, I have been more concerned about the focus and processing which both seem pretty good.  Overall, I'm happy with it. HDR was bad, but I don't find that to be a big deal. I think Oneplus are on the right track, they should work on the software. Aperture is probably the only piece of hardware that I'd be interested in seeing upgraded."

oneplus,3deu9n,fuzzybearcow,3,Wed Jul 15 19:12:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks but I'm not a pro, I just do it for fun...only started a couple years ago I still consider my shots to be average at best but pretty much all I learned on a dslr is applicable to mobile photography so some techniques help.  I keep seeing people complain about the 'shutter lag' but mines always been instant (on the stock camera) even in low light, so something out there is causing the camera performance to degrade - it just hasn't happened to me and I've been using it for just over 12 months.  If you've wiped and tried all those other roms submit and ticket, it should be easy enough to replicate and hopefully they'll just send you a replacement."
oneplus,3deu9n,Kazrock,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:20:52 2015 UTC,"Again, really nice shot and that photo quality is stunning. I wish mine performed half as good haha. Low light? Might as well be using a 1mgp camera. I would submit a ticket but I've had to deal with oneplus's customer service for simpler matters than this before and it took far too long, I think the chance of me getting any help at all from them - nevermind a replacement, is little to none. Nevertheless, worth a try i suppose.  Hope yours will continue working as well, and please, continue with your hobby :)"
oneplus,3deu9n,ZDDP1273,2,Wed Jul 15 19:27:10 2015 UTC,"Yes, my camera has always seemed to have problems. When capturing a video, my phone sometimes just starts auto-focusing rapidly and creates an unpleasant video. When using the camera, I sometimes find that what my screen shows isn't always what the picture is going to look like and will often come out blurry regardless of motion. Its frustrating."
oneplus,3deu9n,Kazrock,3,Wed Jul 15 18:55:27 2015 UTC,I have that auto-focusing problem when I try to take video too!

oneplus,3deu9n,all_purpose_glue,2,Wed Jul 15 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"I recommend everyone in this thread who is having an issue with the camera to use colorOS camera. I've been using this for a few months and I feel the pictures and usability of the camera app are much better. There is an option to use ""tap shutter"", so that means tap to focus on the subject and it'll take the picture at the best focus. Don't have to focus, and then click the shutter. It does it all in one move."

oneplus,3d96dy,peestain,9,Tue Jul 14 14:32:35 2015 UTC,Or that (I really really hope its not) the 810 is doing its over heating and throttling thing

oneplus,3d96dy,Mr_Dream_Chieftain,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:59:47 2015 UTC,"Benchmarks don't do that themselves, some developers of the phone OSes do that to artificially increase benchmark results even though the phone would be throttled to death in real world usage.  Companies like Samsung throwing this into Touchwiz come into mind, but it's entirely possible that OnePlus isn't being shady and just didn't build this feature into the OS.

oneplus,3d96dy,PhantomGamers,4,Tue Jul 14 21:14:07 2015 UTC,"That is plausible, and usually early reviewers (this early in a new company such as OnePlus) get a dev kit and not the final version of the hardware. but also it can be the S810 throttling or just being underclocked to 1.8Ghz.   Or it can be a mixture of both, early hardware with older/unoptimized S810. Hopefully its just that its a dev  kit, hate the S810 on the M9 :/ and hopefully oneplus really did try to limit its throttling."

oneplus,3d96dy,ImKuya,6,Tue Jul 14 16:32:32 2015 UTC,need OIS
oneplus,3d96dy,all_purpose_glue,5,Tue Jul 14 18:45:46 2015 UTC,"So safe to assume now it's a 13mp sensor, do we think its a Sony IMX278? Or something else?"
oneplus,3d96dy,peestain,6,Tue Jul 14 14:15:14 2015 UTC,Same resolution and aperture as before.
oneplus,3d96dy,kharma45,6,Tue Jul 14 14:14:08 2015 UTC,So same sensor as before but with optical image stabilization?
oneplus,3d96dy,Bakgrund,4,Tue Jul 14 14:35:42 2015 UTC,"If it's the same sensor as before, I hope they at least made improvements. The constant clicking while re-focusing is super annoying"
oneplus,3d96dy,mudclog,6,Tue Jul 14 14:47:22 2015 UTC,in the AMA Carl acknowledged that it was a great sensor but that OnePlus' processing needed work. That gives me some hope
oneplus,3d96dy,MakeYouThink,4,Tue Jul 14 15:26:48 2015 UTC,"The processing is definitely the issue, that and lack of OIS. Just look at the N6, same exact sensor, yet it takes way better pictures 90% of the time.   Raw support and all that jazz is cool and all -- but I want a camera that I can take out and snap a pick real quick and know the first time it's going to be in focus and ready to go. Currently it refocuses weirdly. My PNC app its nearly impossible for me to get a clear picture of my paycheck to submit because it refuses to focus on the text."
oneplus,3d96dy,i4mt3hwin,2,Tue Jul 14 15:41:46 2015 UTC,"I have posted this a lot on this subreddit but I'll suggest it again.  Try CameraNext Modded. It is the COS camera with modifications so you can turn off noise reduction and sharpening, and enable zero shutter lag.  Unfortunately there isn't much more you can do about focus issues, but these settings are good for quick pics."
oneplus,3d96dy,Hoogyme,2,Tue Jul 14 16:59:21 2015 UTC,Or: Modded Color OS Camera (with plugins)  I'm getting great results with that. Both are better than the stock camera app of COS 12

Unless your rooted w/ synapse or another kernel manager, you'll just have to rely on the chip to auto throttle itself when temperatures get high and try not to use VR w/the charger plugged in.   If it's really that bad and you don't want to try tweaking through a custom kernel, then RMA. However,  keep in mind the Snapdragon 801 will automatically throttle it's self when heat exceeds a certain point. I'd be able to tell if your Temps are dangerous is you gave us a number.

oneplus,3dez99,scy1192,2,Wed Jul 15 20:12:43 2015 UTC,"""Carrier Unlocked"" means it can go on any network that will accept it. As opposed to ""Carrier Locked"" which means that you can only use it on one carrier (which usually pastes its logo all over the device).  The OnePlus One can't work on Verizon because:   The hardware to communicate at the radio frequencies Verizon uses is not there. You can check that here Verizon only allows certain devices on its network. Look for a Verizon logo on any device you want to use on Verizon. Verizon devices still need to have CDMA hardware, at least until they upgrade their network to allow VoLTE (Voice over LTE). This usually requires manufacturers to make versions specific to Verizon, so see #2   Without these 3 issues the OnePlus One would indeed work on Verizon. It's not related to it being carrier unlocked."

oneplus,3d6xht,drophaze,3,Tue Jul 14 05:22:44 2015 UTC,I had this really cool experience. But I'll talk about what I normally say. Them: WTF What phone is that? Me: Its a phone that you haven't heard of. Them: Then what is it?  Me: OnePlus One Them: One what?  But my friends freak out because its massive compared to iPhones and all their phones.  BUT yesterday I took it out and most people were like WHAT! What phone is that? But a friend was like OH Isnt that the OnePlus phone? Then starts telling everyone how its like the best phone in the world. :D
oneplus,3d6xht,TinyPenguin01,6,Tue Jul 14 06:11:42 2015 UTC,"Oh, this right here? Is a Oneplus One, its a foreign phone that for a lower price outclasses alot of the high end phones here. I let them hold it, talk about the camera and the speed. and where to buy one"

Usually I just say it's a kirf phone because I am poor, then they see the build quality they be like ""this is really nice and seems really smooth."" I say ""kirf phones are pretty good nowadays."" That's it"
oneplus,3d6xht,V4nd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:50:29 2015 UTC,"Man, people where I live are so receptive to new things compared to almost anywhere else it seems. My conversations usually go like this: Them: Wow, that's nice, what kind of phone is that?  Me: It's called a OnePlus One.  Them: Oh, is that new?  Me: Sort of, it's from a start up company called OnePlus (obviously) in China. They want to make brilliant smart phones for a low price. Them: Damn. That's awesome. I want one.  Then we talk about how to get their hands on one."

oneplus,3daaeb,pimceau,3,Tue Jul 14 18:48:57 2015 UTC,How did you flash your phone without a windows computer? Did you flash it on your mac? You could install a windows virtual machine on your mac if you wanted.   Trying to do personal stuff on a work computer is never a good idea.   This may help to fix your bricked OPO: https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/solution-recover-from-hard-bricked-oneplus-one.104943/  Sounds like your phone may have lost power during a flash?
oneplus,3daaeb,Raider1284,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:59:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, I always flashed from my mac, fastboot and adb works just fine on OSX and linux.  I learned my lesson.  Work PC for work only.  As for a VM, not sure if the VM has direct hardware access to the USB device.  I mean if my mac doesn't see any USB device, I guess I won't see them in the VM either."
oneplus,3daaeb,Raider1284,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:09:29 2015 UTC,"If you have a relatively new mac(intel processor), you can install Bootcamp onto your mac for free. https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468  With bootcamp, nothing is emulated, so it will have full, direct access to the usb devices."
oneplus,3daaeb,RickyWars1,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:16:32 2015 UTC,I'll see if I can get a windows trial or something.
oneplus,3daaeb,diablo75,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"Even with a VM, you can give it direct access to USB and other devices. This will make it disappear from your OS until the VM is closed."
oneplus,3daaeb,MrYadro,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:55:49 2015 UTC,I would be very cautious about using a VM.  A long long time ago my wife had an iPhone and I was running Ubuntu with windows in virtualbox and while it LOOKED like iTunes was happy about the connection over USB when it came time to upgrade the phone something obscure happened mid way through when the phone power cycled itself (dropping the port to the VM and falling it back to Linux) and the phone was bricked.  Has to take it to AT&T to get it reset and my wife lost everything she had saved on it.
oneplus,3daaeb,Raider1284,2,Tue Jul 14 21:02:35 2015 UTC,"OS X and Linux are best for flashing, no drivers, just adb/fastboot. Just ask them for instruction, i bet it's all about fastboot images."
oneplus,3daaeb,Raider1284,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:04:58 2015 UTC,adb/fastboot don't see any devices plugged in unfortunately.
oneplus,3daaeb,fuzzybearcow,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:10:29 2015 UTC,But does your mac recognize that something is plugged in? check the System Information/System profiler under hardware->USb. Does something show up there when you plug your OPO into your computer?
oneplus,3daaeb,linuxuser86,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:49:27 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the reply, I will take a look as soon as I get home, forgot about the system profiler."
